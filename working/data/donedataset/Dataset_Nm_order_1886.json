    "Content": "It's long known that the first Watson triple integral evaluates to, $$I_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi^3} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{dx \\, dy \\, dz}{1-\\cos x \\cos y \\cos z}  = \\frac{\\Gamma^4\\left(\\tfrac{1}{4}\\right)}{4\\pi^3} = 1.3932039\\dots$$ Apparently, it is also equivalent to the simple infinite series, $$I_1= \\frac{4}{3} \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(4n)!}{n!^4} \\frac{1}{(2 \\cdot 18^2)^n} $$ which is connected to the Ramanujan-type pi formula, $$\\frac{1}{\\pi}= \\frac{2}{9} \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(4n)!}{n!^4} \\frac{7n+1}{(2 \\cdot 18^2)^n} $$ I found such series for $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$.  Using Mathematica , it is easy to see that they agree to an arbitrary number of decimal digits. But if you can prove them rigorously, it would be interesting to know how.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format the given problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about proving a series representation for the Watson Triple Integrals. The user wants the assumptions and the problem clearly separated, with each assumption being a single property applied to one object.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The question mentions that the first Watson triple integral evaluates to a specific expression involving a gamma function and is equivalent to a certain infinite series. It also states that using Mathematica, the series agree to many decimal digits, and the user is asking for a rigorous proof.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about the properties of 'n' being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the assumptions here might relate to the integral definitions and the equivalence between the integral and the series. However, the problem doesn't state any explicit conditions or constraints beyond the definitions. The integral is defined over a specific domain with a given integrand, and the series is presented as equivalent. Since there's no mention of specific conditions (like convergence criteria or domain restrictions beyond [0, π] for each variable), maybe the assumptions are the definitions of I1 and the series.\n\nBut the example included specific conditions applied to the variable in the problem. Here, the problem states that the integral equals both the gamma function expression and the series. However, the user is asking to prove the series representation. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of I1 as the integral and the equivalence to the gamma function expression. Wait, but the problem is to prove the series form. So maybe the assumptions are the known integral evaluation and the equivalence between the integral and the series? Or perhaps the problem is to show the equivalence between the integral and the series, given that the integral equals the gamma function expression. But the original problem states that the integral is \"long known\" to evaluate to the gamma function and is also equivalent to the series. The user then says they found similar series for I1, I2, I3, and wants a proof.\n\nSo the problem as stated is to prove that the integral I1 equals the given series. The assumptions would be the definitions of the integral and the series. But in the example, the assumptions were conditions on 'n'. Here, since the problem is an equality between an integral and a series, maybe the assumptions are the definitions of the integral and the series. But the user's example had assumptions that were conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7). In this case, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions:\n\nAssumption:\nI₁ is defined as the triple integral (1/π³) ∫₀^π ∫₀^π ∫₀^π [dx dy dz / (1 - cos x cos y cos z)],\nI₁ equals Γ⁴(1/4)/(4π³),\nThe series is defined as (4/3) Σ [(4n)!/(n!⁴)] * 1/(2·18²)ⁿ for n ≥ 0.\n\nBut each assumption must address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each line is a separate assumption. Let's see:\n\n1. I₁ is defined as (1/π³) times the triple integral over [0, π]^3 of 1/(1 - cos x cos y cos z) dx dy dz.\n2. I₁ is known to equal Γ(1/4)^4 / (4π³).\n3. The series S is defined as (4/3) Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4n)! / (n!^4) * (1/(2·18²))^n.\n4. I₁ is claimed to be equivalent to the series S.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that I₁ equals the series. However, in the example, the assumption included a condition that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's setup. Here, the problem states that the integral equals the series, and the user wants a proof. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first Watson triple integral I₁ is defined as (1/π³) ∫₀^π ∫₀^π ∫₀^π [dx dy dz / (1 - cos x cos y cos z)],\nI₁ is known to evaluate to Γ⁴(1/4)/(4π³),\nThe series representation for I₁ is given by (4/3) Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4n)!/(n!^4) * 1/(2·18²)^n.\n\nProblem: Prove that the series representation is equivalent to I₁.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions should list the conditions. However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included only n is an integer and n divisible by 7 as separate assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted assumption listed n as an integer and n divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Because 91 is 7*13, maybe the problem was to show divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by both 7 and 13? But in the example given by the user, maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, following the user's example, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. But in the current problem, the Watson integral is defined, known to equal the gamma expression, and the series is presented as equivalent. The problem is to prove the series form.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. I₁ is defined as the triple integral (1/π³) ∫₀^π ∫₀^π ∫₀^π [1/(1 - cos x cos y cos z)] dx dy dz.\n2. I₁ is known to equal Γ(1/4)^4 / (4π³).\n3. A series S is defined as (4/3) Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4n)!/(n!^4) * 1/(2·18²)^n.\n\nProblem: Prove that I₁ is equal to the series S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove the series representation given the integral definition, without assuming the gamma function result. But the original problem states that the integral is \"long known\" to evaluate to the gamma function and is equivalent to the series. The user wants to prove the series rigorously.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are just the definition of I₁ as the integral, and the problem is to prove that I₁ equals the given series. The fact that I₁ equals the gamma expression might be a known result, but the problem is about connecting the integral to the series. However, in the example, assumptions included both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). Maybe here, the assumptions would include that the integral is defined as given, and the series is as given, and the equivalence is to be proven.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the series for I₁, so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first Watson triple integral I₁ is defined as (1/π³) ∫₀^π ∫₀^π ∫₀^π [dx dy dz / (1 - cos x cos y cos z)],\nThe series S is defined as (4/3) Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4n)!/(n!^4) * 1/(2·18²)^n.\n\nProblem: Prove that I₁ equals the series S.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions that the integral evaluates to the gamma function expression. However, the problem is to prove the series, so maybe the gamma function equivalence is a known result that can be used as an assumption. But the user is asking to prove the series, so perhaps the key assumption is that I₁ is defined as the integral, and the problem is to show it's equal to the series. The gamma function part might be a known result but perhaps not necessary as an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that the integral equals the series, which is equivalent to the gamma expression.\n\nBut given the user's example, which included assumptions beyond the problem's original statement (adding n divisible by 7 when the original was for every integer n), perhaps in this case, we need to list the integral definition and the series definition as assumptions, and the problem is to prove their equality. The fact that the integral equals the gamma expression is a known result but not an assumption needed for the proof.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the series representation given that the integral equals the gamma expression, but I think the main task is to connect the integral to the series, regardless of the gamma function.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an error in the formatted version, but following the user's structure, here's how to proceed:\n\nOriginal problem states that I₁ is known to be equal to the gamma expression and equivalent to the series. The user found similar series for I₁, I₂, I₃ and wants a proof. The problem is to prove the series for I₁.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nI₁ is defined as (1/π³) ∫₀^π ∫₀^π ∫₀^π [1/(1 - cos x cos y cos z)] dx dy dz,\nI₁ is equivalent to the series (4/3) Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4n)!/(n!^4) * 1/(2·18²)^n.\n\nBut wait, that would make the problem redundant. Instead, the problem should be to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions are the definitions. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first Watson triple integral I₁ is defined as (1/π³) times the triple integral over [0, π]^3 of 1/(1 - cos x cos y cos z) dx dy dz,\nThe series S is defined as (4/3) times the sum from n=0 to infinity of (4n)!/(n!^4) times (1/(2·18²))^n.\n\nProblem: Prove that I₁ equals the series S.\n\nAdditionally, the original problem mentions that the integral is equivalent to the gamma function expression. But since the problem is to prove the series, perhaps that's a known result that can be used, but not an assumption. Alternatively, if the problem is to show the equivalence between the integral and the series, given that the integral equals the gamma expression, but the user example didn't include such dependencies. Given the example, I think the correct approach is to list the integral definition and the series definition as separate assumptions and state the problem as proving their equality.",
