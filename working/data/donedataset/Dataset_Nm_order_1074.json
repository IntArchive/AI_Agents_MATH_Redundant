    "Content": "Prove that $\\sin(2A)+\\sin(2B)+\\sin(2C)=4\\sin(A)\\sin(B)\\sin(C)$ when $A,B,C$ are angles of a triangle This question came up in a miscellaneous problem set I have been working on to refresh my memory on several topics I did earlier this year. I have tried changing $4\\sin(A)\\sin(B)\\sin(C)$ to  $$4\\sin(B+C)\\sin(A+C)\\sin(A+B)$$ by making substitutions by reorganizing $A+B+C=\\pi$. I then did the same thing to the other side to get $$-2(\\sin(B+C)\\cos(B+C)+\\sin(A+C)\\cos(A+C)+\\sin(A+B)\\cos(A+B))$$ and then tried using the compound angle formula to see if i got an equality. However the whole thing became one huge mess and I didn't seem to get any closer to the solution. I am pretty sure there is some simpler way of proving the equality, but I can't seem to figure it out. Maybe there is a geometric interpretation or maybe it can be done using just algebra and trig. Any hint's would be appreciated (I would prefer an algebraic approach, but it would be nice to see some geometric proofs as well)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is to prove that sin(2A) + sin(2B) + sin(2C) equals 4 sin(A) sin(B) sin(C) when A, B, C are angles of a triangle. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The main condition here is that A, B, C are angles of a triangle. In a triangle, the sum of the angles is π radians (or 180 degrees). So each angle must be positive and their sum must be π. But the problem statement just mentions they are angles of a triangle. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. A, B, C are angles of a triangle.\n2. Therefore, A + B + C = π (since that's a property of triangle angles).\n\nWait, the user's example had each assumption on a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem states \"when A, B, C are angles of a triangle.\" So maybe the first assumption is that A, B, C are angles of a triangle. The second assumption could be that their sum is π, but actually that's a consequence of being a triangle's angles. So perhaps the main assumption is just that A, B, C are angles of a triangle, which inherently implies A + B + C = π. But the example separated conditions even if they were related. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\" but in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, that example might have been from a different problem where maybe they had an extra condition. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. Then the formatted problem's assumption included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be n is an integer, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Hmm. But regardless, in the current problem, the user's task is to structure the problem as per the given format. So for the current problem, the key assumption is that A, B, C are angles of a triangle. Since that's the only given condition. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are angles of a triangle.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is told to split assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. However, in this case, A, B, C are three different angles, but the condition applies to all three together (they form a triangle). So maybe the assumption is just that A, B, C are angles of a triangle, which includes the sum being π. Alternatively, maybe split into two assumptions: each angle is positive, and their sum is π. But the problem statement doesn't specify positivity, but since they are angles of a triangle, that's implied. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are positive real numbers,\nA + B + C = π.\n\nBut the original problem says \"when A, B, C are angles of a triangle\". So the main condition is that they are triangle angles, which implies both that each is positive and their sum is π. But according to the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the example, the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was wrong. But perhaps in this case, the assumption is just one line: A, B, C are angles of a triangle. But maybe to follow the user's example, where they split into multiple assumptions, perhaps here we can split into A, B, C are angles of a triangle (which is a single condition), but maybe also list the sum condition separately. Wait, but in the example, the user added an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original example problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra condition. Maybe the example was wrong. But perhaps the user wants to list all necessary conditions, even if they are redundant. Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, the key is to list the assumptions. The problem says \"when A, B, C are angles of a triangle\". So the only assumption is that A, B, C are angles of a triangle. But since the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, perhaps here we need to split the conditions. But being angles of a triangle is one condition. However, the problem might require that A + B + C = π. So perhaps we can list two assumptions: A, B, C are angles of a triangle, and A + B + C = π. Wait, but the first implies the second. So maybe the user wants to list both? But in reality, the first is the only assumption, and the second is a consequence. But perhaps the user wants to list the sum as a separate assumption. To follow the example's structure, where even redundant conditions are listed, maybe we should list both. Alternatively, maybe just the fact that they are triangle angles. But the example might be flawed. Let me check again. The example had the original problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n is an integer is correct, but the original problem doesn't say n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example was a mistake, but in any case, for the current problem, the correct assumption is that A, B, C are angles of a triangle. Therefore, the sum A + B + C = π is a property derived from that. So the assumption line should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are angles of a triangle.\n\nBut since the example split into two lines even when they are related, maybe here we need to split into two:\n\nA, B, C are angles of a triangle,\nA + B + C = π.\n\nBut maybe the sum is redundant given the first assumption. However, to make it explicit, perhaps list both. Alternatively, just the first. But I need to follow the user's example. Wait, the user's example took an original problem that had \"for every integer n\" and formatted it with \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's adding an extra condition not present in the original problem. So maybe the example was incorrect. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the correct assumption is just that A, B, C are angles of a triangle, which implies the sum. Therefore, the problem is to prove the trigonometric identity under that assumption. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are angles of a triangle.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sin(2A) + \\sin(2B) + \\sin(2C) = 4\\sin(A)\\sin(B)\\sin(C)$.\n\nBut wait, the user's example listed two assumptions even if one was redundant. So maybe here, since A, B, C being triangle angles implies A + B + C = π, but to make it explicit, list both. But in the original problem, the user didn't mention the sum, but the problem is to prove the identity when they are angles of a triangle. So perhaps the key assumption is just that they are angles of a triangle. Therefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are angles of a triangle.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sin(2A) + \\sin(2B) + \\sin(2C) = 4\\sin(A)\\sin(B)\\sin(C)$.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps split into:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are positive real numbers,\nA + B + C = π.\n\nBut the original problem states \"angles of a triangle\", which inherently includes those two conditions. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"A, B, C are angles of a triangle\" is a single condition applied to three objects. Wait, but the example's first assumption was \"n is an integer\", which is a single property applied to one object. Then the second assumption was \"n is divisible by 7\", which is another property applied to the same object. In this case, maybe we need to split the conditions that make A, B, C angles of a triangle. So each angle is positive, their sum is π, and each is less than π. But the problem might not require stating all of these, but just the necessary ones. Since the problem is about angles in a triangle, the key necessary conditions are that they are positive and sum to π. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are positive real numbers,\nA + B + C = π.\n\nBut the original problem states \"when A, B, C are angles of a triangle\". So translating that into mathematical terms, it's equivalent to the two conditions above. Therefore, to split into two assumptions as per the format, each addressing one property. But maybe the first assumption is about the angles being part of a triangle, which is a single condition. However, since the user's example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are two separate conditions, maybe here we need to split the angle conditions. However, the original problem doesn't specify anything beyond being angles of a triangle, which is a single condition. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to list the single assumption that A, B, C are angles of a triangle. But according to the example, they split into separate lines even if they are related. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. It said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is wrong. In that case, maybe the correct approach is to list the assumptions as they are given in the problem. So in the current problem, the only assumption is that A, B, C are angles of a triangle. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are angles of a triangle.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sin(2A) + \\sin(2B) + \\sin(2C) = 4\\sin(A)\\sin(B)\\sin(C)$.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe the answer requires splitting into the sum condition. Let me think. If I were to write this problem, what assumptions are necessary? The key is that A + B + C = π. Because in trigonometry, when angles sum to π, certain identities hold. So perhaps even if the problem states they are angles of a triangle, the necessary assumption for the proof is that their sum is π. So maybe the formatted assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA + B + C = π.\n\nBut the problem specifies they are angles of a triangle, which implies the sum. However, the problem might be solvable just with the sum being π, regardless of them being angles of a triangle (i.e., they could be any numbers summing to π). But the problem says \"when A, B, C are angles of a triangle\", so perhaps the intended assumption is that they are angles of a triangle. But to make it compatible with the example's format, which split into separate assumptions, perhaps list both the fact that they are angles of a triangle and that their sum is π. But this is redundant. Alternatively, just list the sum. However, since the problem specifically mentions angles of a triangle, perhaps the correct assumption is that they are angles of a triangle. But maybe the user's intended format requires breaking down into constituent conditions. For example, if the problem says \"when x is a positive even integer\", then the assumptions would be \"x is an integer\", \"x is positive\", \"x is even\". Similarly, here, \"angles of a triangle\" implies \"A, B, C are positive\", \"A + B + C = π\". Therefore, the assumptions could be broken down as:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are positive real numbers,\nA + B + C = π.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state \"positive real numbers\", but in the context of triangle angles, they have to be positive and sum to π. So perhaps it's better to split into these two. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA, B, C are positive real numbers,\nA + B + C = π.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sin(2A) + \\sin(2B) + \\sin(2C) = 4\\sin(A)\\sin(B)\\sin(C)$.\n\nThis seems more aligned with the user's example, where they split the conditions even if they are related. So even though the original problem says \"angles of a triangle\", the key mathematical conditions are the positivity and the sum. Therefore, this would be the correct formatting.",
