    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the specified format. Let me start by understanding the original question and filtering out the unnecessary information.\n\nThe title is \"Prove that det(M) ∈ ℤ\". The question states that Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries. M is the sum of all matrices in Γ. We need to prove that the determinant of M is an integer. The hint mentions squaring M and using distributivity of multiplication over addition.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me break down the problem:\n\n1. Γ is a finite multiplicative group. So, Γ is a group under matrix multiplication, and it's finite.\n2. The elements of Γ are matrices with complex entries. Each matrix in Γ has complex entries.\n3. M is defined as the sum of all matrices in Γ. So, M = sum of γ where γ ∈ Γ.\n4. The problem asks to prove det(M) is an integer. The conclusion we need to reach.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". The user modified the problem in the example. Wait, no, looking back, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's not matching. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the user altered the problem, perhaps as an example of how to structure? Maybe they wanted to show that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but if there was a different condition, how to format it. But perhaps the example is not a direct translation but a modified problem. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the actual current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The original problem says Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries. M is the sum of the matrices in Γ. Need to prove det(M) is an integer. So the assumptions are:\n\n- Γ is a finite multiplicative group (so closure under multiplication, inverses, contains identity, etc.)\n- Each matrix in Γ has complex entries.\n- M is the sum of all elements in Γ.\n- The goal is det(M) is an integer.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are the properties of Γ and M.\n\nSo, to structure:\n\nAssumption:\nΓ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices,\nEach element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries,\nM is the sum of all matrices in Γ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that det(M) is an integer.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't state any other conditions. However, perhaps the fact that Γ is a multiplicative group implies certain properties. For example, the identity matrix is in Γ, each element has an inverse in Γ, the product of any two elements is in Γ. But do these need to be listed as separate assumptions? According to the example, each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. So \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group\" is one assumption. Then \"each element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries\" is another. Then \"M is the sum of all matrices in Γ\" is another. But perhaps the multiplicative group being matrices with complex entries is one assumption? Wait, maybe split into:\n\n1. Γ is a finite group under matrix multiplication.\n2. The elements of Γ are matrices with complex entries.\n3. M is the sum of all elements in Γ.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each of these is a separate condition. Then the problem is to prove det(M) is an integer. So the formatted problem should list those three assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nThe original question mentions \"det M\" so we can write that as \"det(M)\" in LaTeX.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nΓ is a finite group under matrix multiplication,\nEach element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries,\nM is the sum of all matrices in Γ.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\det(M)$ is an integer.\n###\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions are written as bullet points but here they are separated by commas. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nIn the example, the formatted problem's assumption is written as:\n\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption is on a separate line, separated by commas. Wait, no. In the example, it's written as:\n\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each line is a separate assumption. Each line is one assumption. So in the current problem, each assumption is:\n\nΓ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices,\n\nEach element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries,\n\nM is the sum of the matrices in Γ.\n\nWait, but the first line could be \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices\". Then the next line is \"Each element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries\". Then \"M is the sum of the matrices in Γ\".\n\nBut maybe \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\". Wait, the original problem says \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\". So perhaps that's a single assumption. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe breaking down:\n\n1. Γ is a finite multiplicative group (under matrix multiplication). \n2. Each element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries.\n3. M is the sum of all matrices in Γ.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the group is already defined as matrices with complex entries. So perhaps the first assumption is \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\". But to split into individual properties, perhaps:\n\n1. Γ is a finite group under matrix multiplication.\n2. Each element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries.\n3. M is the sum of all matrices in Γ.\n\nAlternatively, the original problem says \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\". So maybe that's a single assumption. But the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem was \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this problem, the original problem's first statement is Γ being a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries. That's one assumption. Then M is the sum of the matrices in Γ. That's another. So two assumptions? Or three? Let me think.\n\nWait, in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two assumptions. So perhaps each condition is a separate assumption. So for this problem:\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\n- Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries.\n\nThis can be split into:\n\n1. Γ is a multiplicative group (closed under multiplication, inverses, contains identity).\n2. Γ is finite.\n3. Each element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries.\n\nBut maybe the problem considers \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group\" as one assumption and \"each element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries\" as another. But since the original statement is \"finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\", perhaps it's one assumption: Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries. However, the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem was \"for every integer n\". So maybe the user wants to split all conditions into separate lines, even if they're stated together. So if the original problem says \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\", that can be split into:\n\n- Γ is a multiplicative group,\n- Γ is finite,\n- Each element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries.\n\nBut maybe that's over-splitting. Alternatively, perhaps \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\" as a single assumption. Then \"M is the sum of the matrices in Γ\" as the second assumption.\n\nBut the example had two separate conditions on n. So maybe here, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries.\n2. M is the sum of the matrices in Γ.\n\nBut the problem is to prove det(M) is an integer. So perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nBut I need to check if the problem requires any other implicit assumptions. For example, matrix multiplication is the group operation, which is standard, but maybe that's part of the group being multiplicative. The key points are:\n\n- Γ is a group under matrix multiplication (so contains identity, inverses, closed under multiplication),\n- Γ is finite,\n- All matrices in Γ have complex entries,\n- M is the sum of all these matrices.\n\nTherefore, each of these is an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nΓ is a multiplicative group under matrix multiplication,\nΓ is finite,\nEach matrix in Γ has complex entries,\nM is the sum of all matrices in Γ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\det(M)$ is an integer.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\". So perhaps \"Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\" as one assumption. Then \"M is the sum of the matrices in Γ\" as another.\n\nAlternatively, split into three assumptions: finite, multiplicative group, complex entries. But according to the example, each assumption is one line. So the user's example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nSo they modified the problem. Wait, maybe the example is not a good guide for this particular case. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to list all given conditions as assumptions, each on its own line. So the problem states:\n\nΓ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries. M is the sum of the matrices in Γ.\n\nThus, two assumptions:\n\n1. Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries.\n2. M is the sum of the matrices in Γ.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they split into two assumptions. But in that case, it's modifying the problem. Maybe in this problem, the key is to list all given conditions as separate assumptions. Since the original problem says Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries, which is one condition. Then M is the sum, which is another. So:\n\nAssumption:\nΓ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries,\nM is the sum of the matrices in Γ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\det(M)$ is an integer.\n\nBut maybe the first assumption should be split into multiple. For example:\n\n1. Γ is a multiplicative group of matrices.\n2. Γ is finite.\n3. Each matrix in Γ has complex entries.\n4. M is the sum of all matrices in Γ.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7. So they added an extra assumption. But in the current problem, the original problem doesn't have extra conditions. So perhaps the user wants to list all given conditions as separate assumptions. Since the problem states Γ is a finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries, that's three properties: multiplicative group, finite, complex entries. So split into:\n\n1. Γ is a multiplicative group of matrices.\n2. Γ is finite.\n3. Each matrix in Γ has complex entries.\n4. M is the sum of all matrices in Γ.\n\nBut then the problem is to prove det(M) is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, since \"finite multiplicative group of matrices with complex entries\" is a single condition given, but to split into separate assumptions as per the example where \"for every integer n\" became two assumptions. However, in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error or intentional modification. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the original problem's conditions should be split as per their natural clauses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that each assumption is a single condition applied to one object, so:\n\n- Γ is a multiplicative group (under matrix multiplication),\n- Γ is finite,\n- Each element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries,\n- M is the sum of all elements in Γ.\n\nSo four assumptions. Then the problem is to prove det(M) is an integer.\n\nYes, that seems more precise. Each bullet point addresses one property of one object.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nΓ is a multiplicative group under matrix multiplication,\nΓ is finite,\nEach element of Γ is a matrix with complex entries,\nM is the sum of all matrices in Γ.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\det(M)$ is an integer.\n###\n\nI think this is correct. Each assumption is a separate condition, each on its own line, and the problem is stated clearly.",
