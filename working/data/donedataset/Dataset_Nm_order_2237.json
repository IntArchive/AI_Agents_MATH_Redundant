    "Content": "Prove that if $[F(\\alpha):F]$ is odd then $F(\\alpha)=F(\\alpha^2)$. My justification for this question is as follows; Suppose $F(\\alpha^2)\\subsetneq F(\\alpha)$, we have $F \\subsetneq F(\\alpha^2) \\subsetneq F(\\alpha)$. As $[F(\\alpha):F]=[F(\\alpha):F(\\alpha^2)][F(\\alpha^2):F]$ and $[F(\\alpha):F(\\alpha^2)]=2$ we would be end up with the case that $[F(\\alpha):F]$ is a multiple of 2 i.e., even which contradicts given condition of $[F(\\alpha):F]$ being odd. So, $F(\\alpha^2) =F(\\alpha)$. After doing this, i have seen for a solution on some webpage where he/she used criterion of minimal polynomial. Please let me know Is my justification clear or there are any gaps in between?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof is correct but you don't need contradiction. If $F(\\alpha) \\neq F(\\alpha^2)$ then $\\alpha \\notin F(\\alpha^2)$. Thus consider the tower $[F(\\alpha) : F(\\alpha^2)][F(\\alpha^2) : F]$. The first factor is at most two (because $\\alpha$ is a root of $x^2 - \\alpha^2$ and it is at least two because $\\alpha \\notin F(\\alpha^2)$. By the tower law it follows $[F(\\alpha) : F]$ is even.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. The original problem is about proving that if the degree of the field extension [F(α):F] is odd, then F(α) equals F(α²). \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The user's own justification involves considering the tower of fields F ⊂ F(α²) ⊂ F(α). They argue that if F(α²) is a proper subset of F(α), then the degree [F(α):F] would be even, which contradicts the given odd degree. They also mention seeing a solution using minimal polynomials and are asking if their justification has gaps.\n\nBut the task here isn't to evaluate their proof but to structure the problem according to the format. The example given includes listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is then restated concisely.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"Prove that if [F(α):F] is odd then F(α)=F(α²).\" The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. [F(α):F] is odd. This is a property of the field extension degree.\n2. F is a field, and α is an element in some extension field of F. These are implicit in the context of field extensions but might need to be stated as assumptions depending on strictness. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were only about the variable n being an integer and n being divisible by 7, which were explicit in the problem. So perhaps here, the main assumption is just the degree being odd.\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't mention any other conditions on α or F. The user's question is about their justification, but the problem itself as posed is to prove the statement under the condition that the degree is odd. So the assumption here is solely that the extension degree [F(α):F] is odd. The other conditions (like F being a field, α being algebraic over F) are part of the general context but not specific assumptions added by the problem. However, sometimes in field theory problems, the minimal polynomial's degree is important. But since the problem doesn't specify anything else, maybe only the odd degree is the assumption.\n\nSo following the example, where the assumption was about n being an integer and n divisible by 7 (though in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, which is confusing—wait, let me check again. The original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a typo in the example? Let me look.\n\nOriginal example: The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems like an error, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer. But the formatted problem added n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. However, perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information? Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong? But the user provided that example as their own structuring, so maybe in their case, they considered that the problem was actually under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. That seems like a problem. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I have to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is about proving that if [F(α):F] is odd, then F(α)=F(α²). The assumptions here would be:\n\n- [F(α):F] is odd.\n\nBut in the example, they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that, here, perhaps we need to include that F is a field, α is algebraic over F, and [F(α):F] is odd. However, since in field extensions, α being algebraic is implied if the degree [F(α):F] is finite. Since the problem mentions [F(α):F], which is the degree of the field extension, it is already assuming that α is algebraic over F. Therefore, the necessary assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a field.\n- α is algebraic over F.\n- [F(α):F] is odd.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement is \"Prove that if [F(α):F] is odd then F(α)=F(α²)\". So the main assumption given is [F(α):F] is odd. The other conditions (F being a field, α being algebraic) are part of the context. But the example given by the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, we need to list:\n\n- F is a field.\n- α is an element of an extension field of F.\n- [F(α):F] is odd.\n\nBut the problem statement might not explicitly mention that F is a field, but in the context of field extensions, that's a given. However, to be thorough, maybe it's better to list all necessary assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is incorrect, and the assumptions should only include what is given in the problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n + 1) - 6^n(3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless there was a typo and the original problem was actually to prove for every integer n divisible by 7, but the user mistyped. Maybe there was a mistake in the example, but regardless, I have to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is \"Prove that if [F(α):F] is odd then F(α)=F(α²)\". So the explicit assumption is \"[F(α):F] is odd\". The rest (F is a field, α is algebraic over F) are implicit. However, perhaps in the formatted problem, we need to list all underlying assumptions. But according to the example, they listed even the ones that were perhaps not necessary. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect, but maybe the user made a mistake. However, for the current problem, we need to follow the structure.\n\nThe problem states \"if [F(α):F] is odd\", so the main assumption is that [F(α):F] is odd. But to be precise, we might also need to note that F is a field and α is algebraic over F because [F(α):F] being finite (and odd) implies α is algebraic over F. But does the problem state that [F(α):F] is finite? In field theory, when we talk about the degree [F(α):F], it is finite if and only if α is algebraic over F. Since the problem is about the degree being odd, it's assumed to be finite. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- F is a field.\n- α is algebraic over F.\n- [F(α):F] is odd.\n\nBut in the example, they didn't list all such implicit assumptions. For instance, in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to list all the necessary assumptions, even those not explicitly stated but required for the problem. However, in the current problem, the user is asking to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem. So perhaps the only assumption needed here is that [F(α):F] is odd, as that's the condition given in the problem statement. The rest (F being a field, α being algebraic) are part of the problem's context and don't need to be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. The formatted assumptions included n being divisible by 7, which might be part of the solution's requirement, but the original problem didn't state that. This is confusing. It seems like the example might have an error, but since the user provided it, we have to follow their lead. However, in the current problem, the only given condition is [F(α):F] is odd, so that should be the assumption. The problem is to prove F(α) = F(α²) under that assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n[F(α):F] is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that if [F(α):F] is odd then F(α)=F(α²).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed line by line. However, here, there's only one assumption. Alternatively, maybe split into:\n\n- F is a field.\n- α is an element of an extension field of F.\n- [F(α):F] is odd.\n\nBut I'm not sure if F being a field is an assumption or part of the problem's context. Since the problem is about field extensions, F is assumed to be a field. However, in the example, they didn't list the properties of numbers, just the specific conditions. So perhaps in this case, only the explicitly stated condition is needed as the assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n[F(α):F] is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that F(α) = F(α²).\n\nI think that's correct. The original problem states \"if [F(α):F] is odd\", so the assumption is just that the degree is odd. The rest is context.",
