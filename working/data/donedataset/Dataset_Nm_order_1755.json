But I was able to conjecture a much simpler closed form that fits numerically with a high precision: $$\\mathcal S_5\\stackrel{\\color{gray}?}=\\frac{\\ln^22}2-\\frac{\\ln^25}4+\\ln2\\cdot\\ln5-\\frac12\\,\\operatorname{Li}_2\\!\\left(\\tfrac15\\right)-\\operatorname{Li}_2\\!\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt5-1}2\\right)\\tag{$\\diamond$}$$ I hope there is a way to prove this result manually without going through huge intermediate expressions, but so far I have not found it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is how one can compute $\\mathcal S_m$ for arbitrary $m$. Your formula (3) can be rewritten as \n$$\\mathcal{S}_m=-m\\int_0^1\\frac{\\ln\\frac{1+z}{2}}{z^m-1}z^{m-1}dz=-m\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\\alpha_{km}\\int_0^1\\frac{\\ln\\frac{1+z}{2}}{z-e^{2\\pi i k/m}}dz,$$\nwhere\n$$\\alpha_{km}=\\lim_{\\quad z\\to\\; \\exp{\\frac{2\\pi i k}m}}\\frac{z^{m-1}\\left(z-e^{2\\pi i k/m}\\right)}{z^m-1}=\\frac{e^{2\\pi i k(m-1)/m}}{\\prod_{n\\ne k}\\left(e^{2\\pi i k/m}-e^{2\\pi i n/m}\\right)}=\\frac1m.$$\nNote in particular that the last expression is independent of $k$. The remaining integrals can be computed in terms of polylogarithms:\n$$I\\left(\\zeta\\right)=\\int_0^1\\frac{\\ln\\frac{1+z}{2}}{z-\\zeta}dz=\n\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\zeta}\\right)-\n\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\zeta}\\right)+\n\\ln2\\ln\\frac{\\zeta}{1+\\zeta}.\\tag{1}$$\nWe have in particular\n$$I\\left(1\\right)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{12}-\\frac{\\ln^22}{2},\\qquad\nI\\left(-1\\right)=-\\frac{\\ln^22}{2}. $$ This implies that\n$$\\mathcal{S}_m=-\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}I\\left(e^{2\\pi i k/m}\\right), \\tag{2}$$\nwith $I\\left(\\zeta\\right)$ defined by (1). It is clear that under the sum the elementary pieces of $I(\\zeta)$ simplify. It might happen that something nice happens also with the dilogarithmic ones. Update 1 (how to simplify one of the two sums of dilogarithms to an elementary expression): This formula for $\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(e^{2\\pi i \\mathbb{Q}}\\right)$ implies that\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(e^{2\\pi i k/m}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6m},\\qquad\n\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(-e^{2\\pi i k/m}\\right)=\\begin{cases}\\quad \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6m},\\quad & m\\text{ even}, \\\\ -\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{12m},\\quad & m \\text{ odd}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$ We also have the identity $\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(z\\right)=-\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{z}{z-1}\\right)-\\frac12\\ln^2\\left(1-z\\right)$, which can be rewritten as\n$$\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\zeta+1}\\right)=-\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(-\\zeta^{-1}\\right)-\\frac12\\ln^2\\frac{\\zeta}{\\zeta+1}.$$ Combining both results, we obtain for odd $m$\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{2\\pi i k/m}}\\right)=\n\\frac{\\pi^2}{12m}-\\frac12\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\\ln^2\\left(1+e^{-2\\pi i k /m}\\right),$$\nand for even $m$\n$$\\sum_{k=0 | k\\neq \\frac{m}{2}}^{m-1}\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{2\\pi i k/m}}\\right)=\n\\frac{\\pi^2(m-1)}{6m}-\\frac12\\sum_{k=0| k\\neq \\frac{m}{2}}^{m-1}\\ln^2\\left(1+e^{-2\\pi i k /m}\\right).$$ Update 2 (simplification of the remaining sum for even $m$): We can use again the identity $\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(z\\right)=-\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{z}{z-1}\\right)-\\frac12\\ln^2\\left(1-z\\right)$ to show that\n$$\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\zeta}\\right)+\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{2}{1-\\zeta}\\right)=-\\frac12\\ln^2\\frac{\\zeta-1}{\\zeta+1}.$$\nFor even $m$, if $\\zeta$ is an $m$th root of unity, then so is $-\\zeta$, which simplifies the second sum to an elementary expression:\n$$\\sum_{k=0 | k\\neq \\frac{m}{2}}^{m-1}\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{2}{1+e^{2\\pi i k/m}}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{12}-\\frac{\\ln^2 2}{2}-\\frac12\\sum_{k=1}^{\\frac{m}{2}-1}\\ln^2\\frac{e^{2\\pi i k/m}-1}{e^{2\\pi i k/m}+1}.$$\nAltogether, this leads to evaluation\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{S}_{2n}&=\\frac{\\ln 2\\ln 8n^2}{2}-\\frac{\\pi^2}{12n}+\\frac12\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\ln^2\\frac{e^{\\pi i k/n}-1}{e^{\\pi i k/n}+1}-\\frac12\\sum_{k=0| k\\neq n}^{2n-1}\\ln^2\\left(1+e^{-\\pi i k /n}\\right)=\\\\\n&=\\ln 2\\ln 2n-\\frac{\\pi^2\\left(n^2+1\\right)}{24n}-\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\ln\\left(2\\sin\\frac{\\pi k}{2n}\\right)\\ln\\left(2\\cos\\frac{\\pi k}{2n}\\right).\n\\tag{$\\spadesuit$}\n\\end{align*} Update 3 (partial simplification for odd $m$) Let us denote $m=2n+1$. We will use the identity\n$$\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\zeta}\\right)=\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{\\zeta+1}{\\zeta-1}\\right)+\\frac12 \\ln^2 \\frac{\\zeta-1}{\\zeta+1}\n-\\ln\\left(-\\frac{2}{1+\\zeta}\\right)\\ln\\frac{\\zeta-1}{\\zeta+1}-\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}. \\tag{3}$$\nNow the key three facts are that If $\\zeta$ is $\\zeta^m=1$, then so is $\\zeta^{-1}$. Under replacement $\\zeta\\leftrightarrow \\zeta^{-1}$, the dilogarithm argument on the right of (3) changes its sign. There is an identity $\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( z\\right)+ \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( - z\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( z^2\\right)$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, so I need to be precise and thorough.\n\nFirst, the title is about a conjectured result for an infinite series involving harmonic numbers. The problem is to evaluate the series S_m = sum_{n=1}^infty [(-1)^n H_{n/m} / n]. The user specifically mentions S_5 and provides a conjectured closed-form expression.\n\nLooking at the assumptions, the problem defines H_q as generalized harmonic numbers with an integral representation and digamma function relation. The series S_m is defined with (-1)^n and H_{n/m} over n. There's an integral form derived using substitution, leading to expressions for m=1,2,3,4, and the focus is on m=5. The key assumption here is that m=5, and the goal is to prove the conjectured closed-form for S_5, which includes terms like ln^2 terms and dilogarithms.\n\nThe user also mentions using Mathematica to find an integral but the result is too complicated, so they conjecture a simpler form. The main task is to prove this conjectured result without going through huge intermediate steps.\n\nNow, listing assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n- H_q is a harmonic number generalized to non-integer index q, defined by the sum, integral, or digamma function. That's one assumption about H_q's definition.\n\n- The problem involves the series S_m = sum_{n=1}^infty [(-1)^n H_{n/m} / n]. So S_m is defined as such.\n\n- The integral representations of S_m are equivalent to the series definition. That's another assumption about the integral forms.\n\n- For m=5, the conjectured closed-form is given. So the specific case m=5 is an assumption.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included n is an integer, then the problem mentions divisibility by 91. Hmm, maybe in this case, the problem is specifically about S_5, so the main assumption is m=5. However, the problem statement in the example included the divisibility condition as part of the problem. But here, the user is focusing on S_5 with m=5, so perhaps the assumption is m=5.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the conjectured closed-form for S_5. So the assumptions would include the definition of H_q, the definition of S_m as the given series, and m=5. Also, the integral representations are part of the given problem setup, but maybe those are part of the problem's context rather than assumptions. However, the user did use the integral forms to compute S_1 to S_4, and for S_5, they have a conjectured result. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- H_q is defined as the generalized harmonic number with integral representation etc.\n\n- S_m is defined as the series sum_{n=1}^\\infty [(-1)^n H_{n/m}/n].\n\n- The problem is focused on the case m=5.\n\nBut how to list these as separate assumptions. Each line should be a single assumption applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n\nH_q is a generalized harmonic number defined as H_q = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (1/k - 1/(k+q)) = integral from 0 to 1 of (1 - x^q)/(1 - x) dx = \\gamma + \\psi(q+1), where \\psi is the digamma function.\n\n\\mathcal{S}_m is defined as \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty [(-1)^n H_{n/m}/n].\n\n\\mathcal{S}_m has equivalent integral representations: \\int_0^1 [ln(1 + x^{1/m}) - ln2]/(1 - x) dx = m \\int_0^1 [ln(1 + z) - ln2]/(1 - z^m) z^{m-1} dz.\n\nThe problem is for m=5.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that \\mathcal{S}_5 equals the conjectured expression.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"My goal is to evaluate the following series\" and then focuses on S_5. So in the formatted problem, the problem part would be to prove the conjectured closed-form for S_5.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\nH_q is a generalized harmonic number defined as H_q = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k+q}\\right).\n\nH_q can be expressed as H_q = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1 - x^q}{1 - x} dx = \\gamma + \\psi(q + 1), where \\psi is the digamma function.\n\n\\mathcal{S}_m is defined as \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n H_{n/m}}{n}.\n\n\\mathcal{S}_m has equivalent integral forms: \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1 + x^{1/m}) - \\ln2}{1 - x} dx and m \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln(1 + z) - \\ln2}{1 - z^m} z^{m - 1} dz.\n\nThe problem is for m = 5.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\mathcal{S}_5 = \\frac{\\ln^2 2}{2} - \\frac{\\ln^2 5}{4} + \\ln2 \\cdot \\ln5 - \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) - \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}\\right).\n\nWait, but the example had each assumption as a separate line. So each bullet point is a separate assumption. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But in reality, the original problem didn't mention n divisible by 7, but the user's formatted version added that. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7, and problem is to prove divisible by 91. That seems like a mistake, but maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the original problem actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the example might be flawed. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect. Hmm, but regardless, the user's instruction is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the main points are:\n\n- Definition of H_q.\n\n- Definition of S_m as the series.\n\n- Integral representations for S_m.\n\n- The problem is for m=5.\n\n- The conjectured closed-form for S_5.\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n\nH_q is a generalized harmonic number defined by H_q = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (1/k - 1/(k+q)).\n\nH_q is equivalently expressed as H_q = \\int_0^1 (1 - x^q)/(1 - x) dx.\n\nH_q is related to the digamma function as H_q = \\gamma + \\psi(q + 1).\n\n\\mathcal{S}_m is defined as \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty [(-1)^n H_{n/m} / n].\n\n\\mathcal{S}_m has an equivalent integral form: \\int_0^1 [\\ln(1 + x^{1/m}) - \\ln2]/(1 - x) dx.\n\n\\mathcal{S}_m has another equivalent integral form: m \\int_0^1 [\\ln(1 + z) - \\ln2]/(1 - z^m) z^{m-1} dz.\n\nThe problem considers the case where m = 5.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the conjectured closed-form for S_5.\n\nBut each assumption must be a single line addressing one property. So perhaps splitting each H_q property as separate lines.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem's setup rather than assumptions. Wait, the user's instruction says \"Assumption: All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\".\n\nSo the problem's assumptions are the definitions and conditions given in the problem statement. For example, H_q is defined as that sum, integral, etc. The problem defines S_m as that series, and there are integral representations. Also, the focus is on m=5. So each of these is an assumption.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were n is integer, n divisible by 7, which were conditions on the variable. So perhaps here, the assumptions are the definitions and conditions given. Let's structure accordingly.",
