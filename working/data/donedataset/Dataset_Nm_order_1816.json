    "Content": "Over the years, I've often heard that there is no logarithm function which is continuous on $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0\\}$. The usual explanation is usually some handwavey argument about following such a function around the unit circle, and getting a contradiction at $e^{2\\pi i}$ or something. I've been a little unsatisfied with these. What is a more formal, rigorous proof that there is no continuous log function on $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ that is understandable to a nonexpert? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the logarithm of $e^{it}$ where $t$ is a real number. $\\ln(e^{it}) = it + 2\\pi i k$ where $k$ is some integer.  Since for each $t$ this choice of $k$ is a discrete choice, if your logarithm is continuous, $k$ would have to be constant. So $\\ln(e^{it}) = it + 2 \\pi i k$ but this is not the same for $t=0$ and $t=2\\pi$, so $\\ln$ is not well-defined. So there's one continuity argument I haven't filled in, regarding $k$ having to be constant.  But that's not too tricky.  I suppose the easiest way to show $k$ is constant is to look at the difference $\\ln(e^{it}) - it$, differentiate it and notice that's zero.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let's start by reading the original problem carefully. The question is about why there's no continuous logarithm function on the complex plane minus the origin, ℂ∖{0}. The user mentions that typical explanations involve hand-wavy arguments about traversing the unit circle and getting contradictions with exponents, but they want a more rigorous proof that's understandable to a non-expert.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is set in the context of complex analysis. The key objects here are the complex plane without the origin (ℂ∖{0}) and a hypothetical continuous logarithm function. The main assumption is that such a function doesn't exist, but the problem is to prove that. However, assumptions in the problem setup would be the properties given or required. Wait, the original problem is asking for a proof that no continuous log exists on ℂ∖{0}. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which this is being considered. Let me think.\n\nThe problem is to show that there's no continuous logarithm function defined on all of ℂ∖{0}. So the assumptions here are the properties that such a function would have to satisfy. But in the problem statement, the user isn't adding any extra conditions; it's just the general case. So the main assumption is the domain of the function, which is ℂ∖{0}, and the requirement that the logarithm function is continuous there. But since the problem is to prove that such a function can't exist, maybe the assumption is that such a function exists and leads to a contradiction. Wait, but in the example provided, the assumptions listed were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in that case, the assumptions were the given conditions of the problem. Here, the problem is to prove that no continuous log exists, so perhaps the assumptions are the properties that a logarithm function must have, but the key is to list the conditions given in the problem. But the problem as stated is just to show that there's no continuous log function on ℂ∖{0}. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A logarithm function is defined on ℂ∖{0}.\n- The logarithm function is continuous.\n\nBut since the problem is proving that such a function cannot exist, maybe the assumptions are the properties that would lead to the contradiction. However, the example given for the previous problem listed the assumptions as the conditions given in the problem. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- There exists a function L: ℂ∖{0} → ℂ such that exp(L(z)) = z for all z ∈ ℂ∖{0}.\n- The function L is continuous on ℂ∖{0}.\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a function cannot exist. Therefore, the problem statement would be to prove that no such continuous L exists. So the assumptions would be the existence of such a function, leading to a contradiction. But the user wants the problem to be structured with the assumptions listed. Let me check the example again. In the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So the assumptions are the given conditions. In the current problem, the given condition is the domain ℂ∖{0} and the requirement for a continuous logarithm. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- There exists a continuous function L: ℂ∖{0} → ℂ.\n- For every z ∈ ℂ∖{0}, exp(L(z)) = z.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is stated as \"Prove that there is no continuous logarithm function on ℂ∖{0}\", so the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe here, the assumption is that the domain is ℂ∖{0}, and the problem is to show that no continuous log exists there. Wait, but the problem is to prove that such a function does not exist. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the necessary conditions that a logarithm function must satisfy, which would lead to the contradiction. Alternatively, the problem is posed as \"Why is there no continuous log function on ℂ∖{0}?\" So the problem is to prove the non-existence. The assumptions here would be the properties required for a logarithm function and continuity. But since the problem is to show that such a function can't exist, the assumptions would be the existence of a continuous logarithm function on ℂ∖{0}, leading to a contradiction. But how to phrase that as assumptions in the problem's context. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were the given conditions for the problem. So in this case, the problem is posed as \"Prove there is no continuous log function on ℂ∖{0}\", so the assumptions would be the domain and the properties a log function must have. But maybe the only assumption is that the domain is ℂ∖{0}, and the problem is to prove that no continuous logarithm exists there. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions included both that n is an integer and that it's divisible by 7, which are the conditions for the problem. Here, perhaps the key assumption is that the logarithm function is defined on all of ℂ∖{0} and is continuous. So the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A logarithm function L: ℂ∖{0} → ℂ exists.\n- L is continuous on ℂ∖{0}.\n\nBut maybe the problem is structured as the user's original question, which is asking for a proof that such a function doesn't exist, so the problem is \"Prove that there is no continuous logarithm function on ℂ∖{0}\", with the assumption being the domain ℂ∖{0} and the requirement for continuity. Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Let me check the example again. The example had the original problem stating that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is the assumption in the formatted problem that n is divisible by 7? That seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions list n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's a mistake. Because the problem statement in the example says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which isn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was misformatted. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", not just those divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. If that's the case, then the formatting instructions might not be entirely accurate. However, proceeding with the current problem.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The domain is ℂ∖{0}.\n- A logarithm function L: ℂ∖{0} → ℂ is continuous.\n- For all z ∈ ℂ∖{0}, exp(L(z)) = z.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such a function does not exist, so the problem statement would be \"Prove that there is no continuous function L: ℂ∖{0} → ℂ such that exp(L(z)) = z for all z ∈ ℂ∖{0}.\"\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as properties of the variables involved, even if they were misrepresented. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- The function L is defined on ℂ∖{0}.\n- L is continuous.\n- For every z ∈ ℂ∖{0}, exp(L(z)) = z.\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a function cannot exist. So the formatted problem would list these as assumptions and the problem would be to arrive at a contradiction. However, the original problem is asking for a proof of non-existence, so perhaps the problem statement is as given, and the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed. Since the problem is about non-existence, the assumptions might just be the domain and the desired properties of the function. Alternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond the context. But according to the user's example, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In this case, the problem is to prove that no continuous logarithm exists on ℂ∖{0}, so the assumption would be that such a function exists (leading to a contradiction), but I think the user's example might have had an error. Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to list the necessary conditions for the problem. For instance, the problem is set in ℂ∖{0}, and the function is required to be a continuous logarithm. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- There exists a function L: ℂ∖{0} → ℂ such that exp(L(z)) = z for all z ∈ ℂ∖{0}.\n- The function L is continuous on ℂ∖{0}.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such assumptions lead to a contradiction, i.e., that no such function exists. Therefore, the problem statement would be to prove that under these assumptions, a contradiction arises. However, in the example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove that no such L exists, given the domain and continuity. So maybe the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nL is a function defined on ℂ∖{0},\nL is continuous,\nFor every z ∈ ℂ∖{0}, exp(L(z)) = z.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a function L cannot exist.\n\nBut the original question is \"Why is there no continuous log function on ℂ∖{0}?\" So the problem is to prove that no continuous L exists satisfying exp(L(z)) = z for all z in ℂ∖{0}. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions that such a function exists (for contradiction) and then show the contradiction. However, the user's example might not have considered that the assumptions are the conditions leading to the problem's conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are just the context of the problem, such as the domain being ℂ∖{0} and the desire for a continuous log function. But since the problem is to prove non-existence, the assumptions might not be part of the problem's hypothesis but rather the conditions under which the problem is posed. This is a bit confusing due to the example possibly being incorrect. Given that, I'll proceed by listing the key elements required for the problem: the domain, the continuity requirement, and the logarithm property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe domain of the function is ℂ∖{0},\nThe function L: ℂ∖{0} → ℂ is continuous,\nFor all z ∈ ℂ∖{0}, exp(L(z)) = z.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a function L does not exist.\n\nAlternatively, if the assumptions are only the given conditions without including the hypothetical function, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe complex plane without the origin, ℂ∖{0}, is the domain.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no continuous function L: ℂ∖{0} → ℂ such that exp(L(z)) = z for all z ∈ ℂ∖{0}.\n\nBut the example included specific mathematical conditions on the variables, so maybe here the assumptions are more about the function's properties. Given the confusion from the example, I think the safest approach is to list the necessary conditions for the problem as the assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- L is a function from ℂ∖{0} to ℂ.\n- L is continuous.\n- For every z ∈ ℂ∖{0}, exp(L(z)) = z.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that such a function L cannot exist.\n\nI think this makes sense. The user's example had two assumptions for the variable n, so here we have three assumptions for the function L. The problem then is to show the impossibility under these conditions. So the formatted answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nL is a function defined on $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0\\}$,\nL is continuous,\nFor every $z \\in \\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, $\\exp(L(z)) = z$.\nProblem:\nProve that such a function L does not exist.\n###",
