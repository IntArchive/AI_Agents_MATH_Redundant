    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and identify all the assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe original problem is about showing that the limit of an integral as p approaches infinity equals π²/12. The integral involves a power tower of (x^x) repeated p times. The user also mentions some specific information, like I(1) being the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx, which is evaluated using a series expansion. They note that they don't know how to compute I(p) beyond p=1 and mention that solutions exist on another site, but I should ignore that as per the instructions.\n\nSo, the main problem is to show that the limit of I(p) as p goes to infinity is π²/12. The assumptions would include the definitions provided. Let me list the assumptions step by step:\n\n1. The function I(p) is defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of the power tower of (x^x) with height p, dx.\n2. The limit is taken as p approaches infinity.\n3. The result to show is that this limit equals π²/12.\n4. For p=1, I(1) is the integral of x^x from 0 to 1, which is evaluated using the series sum.\n5. The integral of ln(x)^n x^n from 0 to 1 is given as (-1)^n (n+1)^(-n-1) n!.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the example only includes assumptions that are conditions or properties applied to the objects in the problem. The user's example included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the problem is about an integral's limit. The key assumptions here are the definitions of I(p) and the limit. The note about I(1) and the integral evaluation might be part of the problem's given information but perhaps not assumptions. Wait, the problem statement includes the definition of I(p), so that's an assumption. The goal is to prove the limit equals π²/12. The other parts like I(1) being a sum and the integral formula are perhaps given information but maybe not assumptions. The user's example included only the necessary conditions. Hmm.\n\nThe user's example included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. These were conditions for the problem. In the current problem, the integral's definition and the limit are part of the problem statement, so maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- The function I(p) is defined for each positive integer p as the integral from 0 to 1 of the power tower of (x^x) of height p.\n- The limit as p approaches infinity of I(p) exists.\nWait, but the problem is to show that the limit is π²/12. So perhaps the only assumption is that I(p) is defined as that integral, and the problem is to find the limit. Wait, but in the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, even though the problem didn't state it. Wait, in the example, the user added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". So maybe here, the assumptions are the definitions and any given conditions. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Show that ∫₀¹ (x^x)^(x^x)^...^ (x^x) dx (p times) equals π²/12 as p approaches infinity.\"\n\nThe problem defines I(p) as that integral and wants the limit as p→infty. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each positive integer p, I(p) is the integral from 0 to 1 of the power tower of (x^x) with height p.\n- The limit is taken as p approaches infinity.\nBut the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's hypothesis, like \"n is an integer\". Here, the problem is about the integral and its limit. The other parts mentioned (like I(1) being the sum) are part of the given information but maybe not assumptions. Wait, the problem says \"How can it be shown that...\" followed by the limit. So the assumptions would be the definitions needed to state the problem. Let me structure it:\n\nAssumption:\nI(p) is defined as ∫₀¹ (x^x)^{(x^x)^...} dx with p occurrences of x^x in the exponentiation tower,\nThe limit is considered as p approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that lim_{p→∞} I(p) = π²/12.\n\nAdditionally, the user provided in their example that the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem statement said \"for every integer n\". Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem under assumptions had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then there's no need to assume n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the example was modified. Let me check again.\n\nAh, perhaps the example was a different problem. Suppose the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the assumptions would include n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in the example provided by the user, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect. However, I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nSo, applying the same approach, in the current problem, the assumptions would include any conditions necessary for the problem. The problem here is to show that the limit of I(p) is π²/12. The integral is defined for each p, and the limit is as p approaches infinity. So the assumptions are:\n\n- I(p) = ∫₀¹ (x^x)^{(x^x)^{...^{x^x}}} dx with p instances in the tower,\n- The limit is taken as p approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list these as assumptions and the problem statement as showing the limit equals π²/12.\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem's statement (adding n divisible by 7), which suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. However, in the current problem, the original problem's statement doesn't have additional implicit assumptions beyond what's written. The integral is from 0 to 1, which is a closed interval, and x^x is defined there (though at x=0, x^x is 0^0, which is indeterminate, but perhaps in the context, it's treated as a limit from the right). However, maybe that's considered part of the problem's setup and not an assumption. The user's example didn't include domain assumptions unless they were part of the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here would be the definitions of I(p) and the limit. The problem is to show the limit equals π²/12. The other information about I(1) and the integral formula is part of the question's context but not assumptions per se. The user's instruction says to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The note about the integral being proposed elsewhere and solutions existing is unrelated and should be omitted.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nI(p) is the integral from 0 to 1 of the power tower of (x^x) with height p,\nThe limit is taken as p approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that lim_{p→∞} I(p) = π²/12.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"Show that ∫₀¹ (x^x)^... dx = π²/12\"\n\nBut the integral is written as a limit as p approaches infinity. So the problem is to show that the limit of I(p) as p→∞ is π²/12.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have the two assumptions I mentioned. However, the user's example included each assumption as a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nI(p) is defined for each positive integer p as ∫₀¹ (x^x)^{(x^x)^{...^{x^x}}} dx with p exponents,\nThe limit of I(p) as p approaches infinity is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that lim_{p→∞} I(p) = π²/12.\n\nBut perhaps splitting into more lines. Let me check the example again. In the example, each assumption was a separate line, even if they applied to the same object. The first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", the second was \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nI(p) is defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of (x^x) raised to the power tower of height p,\nThe variable p is a positive integer,\nThe limit is evaluated as p approaches infinity.\n\nBut maybe even more detailed. The key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer p, I(p) = ∫₀¹ (x^x)^{(x^x)^{⋰}} dx (with p instances of x^x in the exponentiation tower),\nThe problem considers the limit of I(p) as p approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that lim_{p→∞} I(p) = π²/12.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the format. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition or property. The first line defines I(p), the second line states the limit is considered. The problem then is to show the limit equals π²/12.",
