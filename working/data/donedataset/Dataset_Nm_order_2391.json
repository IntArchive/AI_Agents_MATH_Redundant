    "AcceptedAnswer": "Without loss of generality we may assume the real number $a$ is $\\gt 0$. (If $a \\lt 0$, we can apply the argument below to $|a|$ and then switch signs.)\nWe sketch a fairly formal proof, based on the fact that the reals are a complete ordered field. In one of the remarks at the end, we give an easy informal but incomplete \"proof.\" Let $n$ be  a natural number.  Let $m=m(n)$ be the largest positive integer such that $\\frac{m}{n}\\lt a$. Then $\\frac{m+1}{n}\\ge a$, and therefore $|a-m/n|\\lt 1/n$. Let $r_n=m/n$. It is easy to show from the definition of limit that the sequence $(r_n)$ has limit $a$. Remarks: $1.$ One really requires proof that there is a positive integer $m$ such that $\\frac{m}{n}\\ge a$. It is enough to show that there is a positive integer $k$ such that $k \\ge a$, for then we can take $m=kn$. \nThe fact that there is always an integer $\\gt a$ is called the Archimedean property of the reals. We proceed to prove that the reals do have this property. Suppose to the contrary that all positive integers are $\\lt a$. Then the set $\\mathbb{N}$ of positive integers is bounded,  so has a least upper bound $b$. That means that for any $\\epsilon \\gt 0$ there is an integer $k$ such that $0\\lt k\\lt b$ and $b-k\\lt \\epsilon$. Pick $\\epsilon=1/2$.  Then $k+1\\gt b$, contradicting the assumption that $b$ is an upper bound for $\\mathbb{N}$. $2.$ One can also give a very quick but not fully persuasive \"proof\" of the approximation result.  Assume as before that $a\\gt 0$. The numbers obtained by truncating the decimal expansion of $a$ at the $n$-th place are rational, and clearly have limit $a$. The problem is that we are then assuming that every real number has a decimal expansion.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe question is asking to prove that for every real number a, there exists a sequence of rational numbers r_n such that r_n approaches a. The user wants this problem formatted with Assumptions and the Problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is then stated clearly.\n\nIn this case, the original problem doesn't explicitly state any assumptions beyond the general context. The main objects here are the real number a and the sequence r_n of rational numbers. The goal is to show the existence of such a sequence converging to a.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement might have implicit assumptions. Let me think. The problem is about real numbers and sequences of rationals converging to them. This is related to the density of rationals in the real numbers. The key assumptions here would be that a is a real number, and the sequence r_n consists of rational numbers. The convergence is to a.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list that a is a real number, each r_n in the sequence is rational, and the sequence converges to a. Each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nBut in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the user restructured it to list those as separate assumptions. Similarly, here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a real number.\n- r_n is a sequence of rational numbers.\n- The sequence r_n converges to a.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that such a sequence exists. So the assumptions are the given conditions, which in this case, the only given condition is that a is a real number. The existence of the sequence r_n with the properties of being rational and converging to a is what needs to be proven. Therefore, the assumptions should only include the given conditions, not the things that need to be proven.\n\nSo in the original problem, the user is to prove that for every real number a, there exists a sequence r_n of rationals such that r_n approaches a. Therefore, the assumption is that a is a real number. The problem is to show there exists such a sequence.\n\nBut in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, in that example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, there's an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that was a mistake? Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem: Assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems off. Wait, in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's not part of the original problem. Wait, maybe that was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption should be that n is an integer. The divisibility by 91 is the conclusion. But the example's formatted problem has n being divisible by 7 as an assumption, which is not part of the original problem. That seems incorrect. Perhaps the user made a mistake there. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions, even if the example is flawed.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem doesn't mention n being divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to filter out some information. Maybe in that case, the original problem actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user restructured it. Maybe there was a miscommunication in the example. But perhaps the key point is that the assumptions should list all the conditions given in the problem. So in the current problem, the user needs to structure the problem by listing the assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem: \"For every real number a there exists a sequence r_n of rational numbers such that r_n approaches a.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- a is a real number.\n\nBecause the problem is for every real number a. Then the problem is to show the existence of a sequence r_n of rational numbers converging to a. The sequence being of rational numbers is part of the conclusion, not the assumption. Wait, no: the problem states \"there exists a sequence r_n of rational numbers such that r_n approaches a\". So the existence is to be proven. Therefore, the only assumption given is that a is a real number. The rest is what needs to be proven: existence of a rational sequence converging to a.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a sequence $r_n$ of rational numbers such that $r_n \\rightarrow a$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included both n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the example was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not part of the original problem. That might be a mistake. So maybe the user intended that in the example, there was an error, but we need to follow the instruction.\n\nBut given the user's example, even if flawed, the current problem's assumptions should be extracted. Since the problem is \"for every real number a...\", the only assumption is that a is a real number. There's no other condition. The sequence r_n must be of rationals and converge to a, but those are parts of the conclusion, not the assumptions. Therefore, the assumption is just that a is a real number, and the problem is to prove the existence of the sequence with those properties.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that such a sequence exists. So the assumptions are the given conditions. The given condition is that a is a real number. The problem is to show the existence of the sequence. Therefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a sequence $r_n$ of rational numbers such that $r_n \\rightarrow a$.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each assumption is a single property of one object. Here, the only assumption is that a is a real number. The rest is what needs to be proven.",
