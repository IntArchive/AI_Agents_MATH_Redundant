    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original question is about proving the inequality arctan(π/2) ≥ 1. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. In the example, they listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line.\n\nLooking at the current problem: \"Prove that arctan(π/2) ≥ 1\". The user, Sis, is asking for a nice way to show this inequality. Now, I need to think about the assumptions here. The function arctan(x) is involved. What are the inherent assumptions when dealing with arctan? Well, arctan is typically defined for all real numbers, and its range is (-π/2, π/2). However, since the input here is π/2, which is a positive real number, the output will be in (0, π/2). \n\nBut wait, the problem is to compare arctan(π/2) with 1. Since arctan returns values in radians, 1 is a radian measure here. The question is whether the arctangent of π/2 is at least 1 radian. So possible assumptions could relate to the domain and range of the arctan function. However, the original problem doesn't state any explicit conditions; it's just asking to prove the inequality. \n\nIn the example, the assumptions included conditions on n, but here there are no variables given. The problem is a direct inequality. So maybe the assumptions here are about the properties of the arctan function and the value π/2. Let's see. Since arctan is defined for all real numbers, and π/2 is a positive real number, but arctan's argument is π/2. Wait, arctan takes any real number, but π/2 is approximately 1.5708, which is a valid input. The output of arctan(π/2) would be an angle whose tangent is π/2. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe the problem assumes that we're working in radians, which is standard in higher mathematics. Also, the inequality is comparing arctan(π/2) with 1, which is a dimensionless number, so the units are consistent if we're using radians. \n\nSo possible assumptions could be:\n\n- The arctangent function is defined with its principal value (i.e., range (-π/2, π/2)).\n- The input to the arctangent function, π/2, is a real number.\n- The comparison is made in radians.\n\nBut since the problem is straightforward and the original question doesn't specify any particular conditions, maybe there are no additional assumptions needed beyond the basic properties of the arctan function. However, the example included even basic assumptions like n being an integer. So perhaps here, the assumption is that π is the mathematical constant approximately 3.14159..., and that the arctangent function is considered with its standard principal branch. \n\nWait, but the problem is to prove arctan(π/2) ≥ 1. Let me check numerically: arctan(π/2) is arctan(1.5708). Since tan(1) is approximately 1.5574, and tan(1.0036) ≈ 1.5708. Therefore, arctan(1.5708) ≈ 1.0036, which is indeed greater than 1. So the inequality holds. But how to prove it without a calculator?\n\nOne method is to use the Taylor series expansion of arctan or compare it with known values. For example, since tan(1) ≈ 1.5574 < π/2 ≈ 1.5708, then because arctan is an increasing function, arctan(π/2) > 1. Because if x > tan(1), then arctan(x) > 1. So the key assumption here might be that the arctangent function is strictly increasing, which is true in its domain.\n\nBut in terms of assumptions for the problem structure, maybe:\n\n- The arctangent function is strictly increasing on its domain.\n- π is the mathematical constant approximately 3.14159...\n- The comparison is made in radians.\n\nHowever, the original problem didn't state these; they are inherent in the mathematical functions used. The example included assumptions that were part of the problem statement (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). Here, the problem is to prove the inequality, and the assumptions would be any conditions needed for the problem to hold. Since the inequality is always true (as arctan(π/2) ≈1.0036>1), perhaps there are no additional assumptions needed beyond the standard mathematical definitions. \n\nBut according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, actually, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe the user made an error in the example? Because if the problem is to prove it for every integer n, but then the assumption is n is divisible by 7, that changes the problem. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Formatted assumption: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems contradictory because the problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be an error. Perhaps the user intended to have an example where the original problem had a condition, but the formatted problem listed assumptions. So maybe there's a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user provided that example, so I need to follow their format.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is \"Prove that arctan(π/2) ≥1\". There are no stated conditions, so perhaps the only assumption is that π is the standard mathematical constant and arctan is the principal branch. But according to the example, they split assumptions even if they are part of the problem statement. However, in this case, there are no explicit variables or conditions given. So maybe the assumptions are empty? But the example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that logic, even if the problem doesn't state assumptions explicitly, we need to list the underlying assumptions.\n\nBut how? In the current problem, the only object is arctan(π/2) and the inequality. The assumptions could be:\n\n- The arctangent function is considered with its principal value (i.e., range (-π/2, π/2)).\n- π is the mathematical constant approximately 3.14159...\n\nBut are these necessary? The problem as stated doesn't mention these, but they are part of the standard mathematical definitions. However, according to the example, even obvious assumptions related to the problem's objects should be listed. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" is listed as an assumption, which is part of the problem's original statement.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original problem is to prove the inequality. There are no variables, just constants. So perhaps there are no assumptions to list. But that can't be, because the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed. Wait, maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. Because in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", which means the assumption is that n is any integer. But in the formatted problem, they list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition, like \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the assumptions would be \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the example's original problem is stated as \"for every integer n\", which would mean the formatted problem's assumptions should just be \"n is an integer\". But the example's formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect. However, the user provided that example, so I have to follow their structure even if there's a mistake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, even though there are no explicit variables, we need to list assumptions related to the constants and functions used. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe arctangent function is evaluated in radians.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify that. However, since 1 is a radian measure, comparing to arctan which in radians gives a numerical value. Alternatively, if we were in degrees, 1 degree is much smaller, but the problem likely assumes radians. So that could be an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the argument of arctan is a real number, which π/2 is. But again, π/2 is a real number, so that's inherent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions needed, and the problem is as stated. But according to the example, even obvious assumptions are listed. For instance, in the example, the problem states \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\". So similarly, here, if there are no variables, perhaps there are no assumptions. But the problem involves π and arctan, so maybe assumptions about those.\n\nWait, the example's formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is taken from the original problem's quantifier \"for every integer n\". So in the current problem, since there are no variables with quantifiers, perhaps there are no assumptions to list. But the example might be misleading. The user might want me to list any underlying assumptions needed for the problem to hold. For example, the problem arctan(π/2) ≥1 is true because π/2 > tan(1). Therefore, one needs to know that tan(1) is approximately 1.5574, and π/2 is approximately 1.5708, so π/2 > tan(1). Hence, arctan(π/2) >1 because arctan is increasing. So the assumptions would be that arctan is strictly increasing, and that π is a constant such that π/2 > tan(1). But these are properties of the functions and constants involved. \n\nHowever, according to the example, assumptions are listed as separate conditions applied to one object. For example, in the example, each assumption is about n. Here, if there are no variables, perhaps the assumptions are about the functions or constants used. But the example didn't include such assumptions. For instance, in the example, they didn't list assumptions about 5^n or 6^n, just about n. \n\nSo maybe in this case, since there are no variables, the problem has no assumptions. But the example had assumptions even when the original problem stated them. So perhaps the formatted problem should have no assumptions? But the example included assumptions even from the problem's original statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption here is that π/2 is a positive real number, which it is, but that's inherent. Or that the arctan function is defined for π/2, which it is. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that we're using the principal branch of arctan, but that's standard. \n\nGiven the example, which included assumptions that were part of the problem's original statement (n is an integer), even though the problem said \"for every integer n\", the user might expect me to list any conditions or properties that the problem relies on. However, in this case, the problem doesn't have any variables or explicit conditions. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions to list, and the problem is just the inequality. But the example shows that even when the problem is stated generally, assumptions are extracted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption here is that the comparison is in radians, which is necessary for the inequality to make sense. If we were in degrees, 1 radian is about 57 degrees, but arctan(π/2 degrees) would be a different comparison. So the assumption is that the units are radians.\n\nSo to structure this according to the user's example, I need to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. \n\nPossible assumptions:\n\n- The arctangent function is considered in radians.\n- π is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159...\n\nBut does the problem need these assumptions? The original problem doesn't state them, but they are necessary for the problem to hold. For example, if π were a different value, the inequality might not hold. However, π is a standard constant. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to compare arctan(π/2) with 1, and since arctan is increasing, the key is that π/2 > tan(1). So another assumption could be that the function arctan is strictly increasing on its domain. But again, this is a property of the function.\n\nHowever, according to the example, the assumptions are about the objects in the problem. In the example, the object is n, and assumptions are about n. Here, the objects are π and the arctan function. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- π is the mathematical constant approximately 3.14159...\n- The arctangent function is strictly increasing on its domain.\n\nBut the problem might not need to state these explicitly, as they are standard mathematical facts. But according to the example, even basic conditions from the problem statement are listed. Therefore, since there are no variables here, maybe there are no assumptions, and the problem is just as stated. However, the example included assumptions even when the problem stated the conditions. \n\nGiven that the user's example included assumptions derived from the problem's quantifier, but in this case there are no quantifiers, maybe the assumptions section should be empty. However, the format requires listing assumptions. Looking back at the user's instruction: \"All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". \n\nIn the current problem, the objects are arctan and π/2. The properties needed are that arctan is invertible and increasing, and that π/2 is a real number. But these are inherent in the standard definitions. If we must list them as assumptions, then:\n\nAssumption:\n- The input to the arctangent function is a real number.\n- The arctangent function is strictly increasing on its domain.\n\nBut π/2 is a real number, so that's covered. Alternatively, since the problem is about proving an inequality involving arctan(π/2), maybe the assumption is that π/2 is within the domain of arctan, which it is. But again, these are standard.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where even the obvious condition (n is an integer) is listed, perhaps here the assumption is:\n\n- π/2 is a real number.\n- The arctangent function is evaluated in radians.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the problem is to compare arctan(π/2) with 1, and the key is that tan(1) is less than π/2, perhaps the assumption is that tan(1) < π/2, but that's what needs to be proven indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is to prove the inequality based on known mathematical properties. In that case, perhaps the assumptions section is empty. But the example didn't have an empty assumption section.\n\nGiven the user's example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed. Therefore, in the current problem, even though the problem doesn't state any conditions beyond the inequality itself, maybe we need to list the necessary assumptions that allow the problem to be valid. \n\nAnother angle: The inequality arctan(π/2) ≥1 is equivalent to π/2 ≥ tan(1), since arctan is increasing. So if we can assume that π/2 ≥ tan(1), then the inequality holds. But proving that π/2 ≥ tan(1) is the core of the problem. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is that π/2 ≥ tan(1), but that's circular because that's what needs to be proven.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to show that arctan(π/2) is at least 1 radian. The key step is to recognize that tan(1) ≈ 1.5574 < π/2 ≈ 1.5708, hence arctan(π/2) >1. Therefore, the assumption here is that tan(1) < π/2, but proving that requires knowing the values of tan(1) and π/2.\n\nBut how to structure this into assumptions? The problem itself doesn't state any assumptions; it's direct. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions to list, and the problem is simply as stated. However, the example provided by the user includes assumptions even when they are part of the problem statement. Therefore, to adhere to the format, maybe list that:\n\nAssumption:\n- The arctangent function is evaluated in radians.\n\nBecause if we were using degrees, the comparison would be different. But in mathematics, especially in calculus, angles are typically in radians unless stated otherwise. Therefore, specifying that the arctan is in radians is a valid assumption.\n\nAnother possible assumption is that π is the standard mathematical constant. But that's universally accepted.\n\nGiven the example's structure, where n's properties are listed, perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\n- The value π is approximately 3.14159...\n- The arctangent function returns values in radians.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the problem is to compare arctan(π/2) with 1, and 1 is a radian measure, the assumption is that the units are radians. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- Angles are measured in radians.\n\nThis ensures that the comparison between arctan(π/2) and 1 is valid in the same units.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nAngles are measured in radians.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\arctan\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\ge1.$$\n\nThis seems reasonable. Because if angles were in degrees, arctan(π/2) would be a small value in degrees, but 1 degree is much less than arctan(π/2 degrees), but the comparison would be different. However, since the problem is posed in a mathematical context, radians are assumed, but it's safer to list it as an assumption.\n\nSo, after this lengthy consideration, I think the correct formatted problem would have one assumption about the unit being radians, and the problem statement.",
