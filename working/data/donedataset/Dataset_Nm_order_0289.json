    "Content": "Wikipedia claims that every repeating decimal represents a rational number. According to the following definition, how can we prove that fact? Definition: A number is rational if it can be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \\neq 0$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that the decimal is $x=a.d_1d_2\\ldots d_m\\overline{d_{m+1}\\dots d_{m+p}}$, where the $d_k$ are digits,  $a$ is the integer part of the number, and the vinculum (overline) indicates the repeating part of the decimal. Then $$10^mx=10^ma+d_1d_2\\dots d_m.\\overline{d_{m+1}\\dots d_{m+p}}\\;,\\tag{1}$$ and $$10^{m+p}x=10^{m+p}a+d_1d_2\\dots d_md_{m+1}\\dots d_{m+p}.\\overline{d_{m+1}\\dots d_{m+p}}\\tag{2}\\;.$$ Subtract $(1)$ from $(2)$: $$10^{m+p}x-10^mx=(10^{m+p}a+d_1d_2\\dots d_md_{m+1}\\dots d_{m+p})-(10^ma+d_1d_2\\dots d_m)\\;.\\tag{3}$$ The righthand side of $(3)$ is the difference of two integers, so it’s an integer; call it $N$. The lefthand side is $\\left(10^{m+p}-10^m\\right)x$, so $$x=\\frac{N}{10^{m+p}-10^m}=\\frac{N}{10^m(10^p-1)}\\;,$$ a quotient of two integers. Example: $x=2.34\\overline{567}$. Then $100x=234.\\overline{567}$ and $100000x=234567.\\overline{567}$, so $$99900x=100000x-100x=234567-234=234333\\;,$$ and $$x=\\frac{234333}{99900}=\\frac{26037}{11100}\\;.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that every repeating decimal is rational, using the definition that a number is rational if it can be written as p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the assumptions are in the problem. The example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". For this problem, the main assumption is the definition provided, but I need to break it down into individual assumptions, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThe problem is to prove that every repeating decimal is rational. So, the assumptions should include the definition of a rational number as given. Let me parse the definition: a number is rational if it can be written as a fraction p/q with p and q integers and q not zero. Each part of this definition can be an assumption. However, according to the example, each assumption line should address only one property or condition for one object. So, splitting the definition into separate lines: \n\n1. A number is rational if it can be written as p/q.\n2. p is an integer.\n3. q is an integer.\n4. q ≠ 0.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's definition is given as a single statement. The example structured the assumptions by breaking down the conditions. However, in the example, the assumption was split into two parts: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The key here is to list each condition separately. Since the definition of a rational number includes multiple conditions (p and q integers, q ≠ 0), each of these should be separate assumptions. But maybe the problem itself doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the definition provided. Wait, the problem is to prove that every repeating decimal is rational based on that definition. So the assumptions here are essentially the conditions given in the definition. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A number is rational if it can be written as p/q.\n- p is an integer.\n- q is an integer.\n- q ≠ 0.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included the conditions on n. Here, the problem is more about using the definition to prove the statement. However, perhaps the key assumption is the definition itself. Alternatively, maybe the problem is presented with the definition as given, so the assumptions are the components of the definition. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem mentions that A(n) is defined with 5^n and 6^n terms, and the user structured the assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in that example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. Then, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem had assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That would mean that in the example, the formatted problem is actually adding an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the original problem was edited or misrepresented. Alternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, following the user's instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the format given in the example.\n\nSo for the current problem, the original question is: \"Proof that every repeating decimal is rational. According to the following definition, how can we prove that fact? Definition: A number is rational if it can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that every repeating decimal is rational, using the given definition. The assumptions would be the components of the definition. However, in the example, the assumptions included conditions on the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the definition is the key assumption. But since the definition already includes multiple conditions, perhaps we need to split them into separate lines as per the format's requirement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond what's given in the definition. But the example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so that's an assumption. Then the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. This suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, or maybe the user added an extra assumption. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to filter out some information. Hmm. This is a bit confusing.\n\nBut focusing on the current problem: the user provides a definition of a rational number, and the task is to prove that every repeating decimal is rational. The problem itself doesn't have additional explicit assumptions beyond the definition. However, the definition includes multiple conditions (p and q integers, q ≠ 0). Therefore, following the example's structure, each condition should be listed as a separate assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A number is rational if it can be written as p/q.\n- p is an integer.\n- q is an integer.\n- q ≠ 0.\n\nBut wait, the first line is the definition, and the next three lines are the components. Alternatively, perhaps the definition is given as one assumption, but according to the example, each assumption should address only one property. Therefore, the definition can be split into the four parts. However, the definition as stated in the problem is a single statement. To adhere to the format, we need to list each condition separately. So:\n\nAssumption: A number is rational if it can be written as p/q.\nAssumption: p is an integer.\nAssumption: q is an integer.\nAssumption: q ≠ 0.\n\nBut in reality, the definition of a rational number is that it can be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. So the problem is asking to use this definition to prove that repeating decimals are rational. Therefore, the assumptions here are the parts of the definition. However, the problem might not have additional assumptions beyond the definition. Alternatively, maybe the problem has an implicit assumption that a repeating decimal is a real number with a repeating pattern, but the user might not consider that as an assumption. Since the example broke down the conditions of the problem into separate lines, we need to do the same here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only assumption is the definition provided. But the user's example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two assumptions. So in this case, since the definition has three components (p integer, q integer, q ≠ 0), each would be a separate assumption. However, the first part \"A number is rational if it can be written as p/q\" is the main definition, and the following lines are the conditions. But perhaps the problem's assumptions are just the definition, and the components are part of the definition. However, the example shows that even the conditions on n are split into separate lines. So following that, we need to split the definition into its components.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. A number is rational if it can be written as p/q.\n2. p is an integer.\n3. q is an integer.\n4. q ≠ 0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user provides the definition as a single statement. So perhaps the correct way is to list the definition as one assumption. However, according to the example, each assumption should address only one property. So the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the example, the user considered \"for every integer n\" as one assumption, and then added another assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem. That seems odd. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions:\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which means n is any integer. However, the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which restricts n to multiples of 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had additional conditions that weren't mentioned. Regardless, the user provided that example, so we have to follow the structure even if the example seems flawed.\n\nBut in our current problem, the key is to extract the assumptions from the problem statement. The problem statement gives the definition of a rational number, and asks to prove that every repeating decimal is rational. Therefore, the assumptions are the components of the definition. So breaking down the definition:\n\n\"A number is rational if it can be written as p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\"\n\nThis can be split into:\n\n1. A rational number can be written as p/q.\n2. p is an integer.\n3. q is an integer.\n4. q ≠ 0.\n\nTherefore, each of these is a separate assumption. However, the first part is the main condition, and the next three are the requirements for p and q. So following the example's structure, each condition is a separate line.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: A number is rational if it can be written as p/q.\nAssumption: p is an integer.\nAssumption: q is an integer.\nAssumption: q ≠ 0.\nProblem: Prove that every repeating decimal is rational.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's only assumption is the definition, and the components are part of that definition. But according to the user's example, even if the original problem had \"for every integer n\", it was split into an assumption \"n is an integer\", so similarly here, the definition's components should be split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are just the definition, and the rest is part of the problem statement. But the user's example included additional assumptions beyond the problem's original statement. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. However, regardless of that, we need to follow the instructions given.\n\nIn the current problem, the definition is given as part of the question. So the assumptions are the parts of the definition. Therefore, splitting them:\n\nAssumption: A number is rational if it can be written as p/q.\nAssumption: p is an integer.\nAssumption: q is an integer.\nAssumption: q ≠ 0.\nProblem: Prove that every repeating decimal is rational.\n\nThis seems correct. Each assumption addresses one property: the first is the main condition, the next two are about p and q being integers, and the last is about q not being zero. So this follows the example's structure where each assumption is a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be structured as follows.",
