    "Content": "This question is taken from Dummit and Foote (14.9 #6). Any help will be appreciated: Show that if $t$ is transcendental over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $\\mathbb{Q}(t,\\sqrt{t^3-t})$ is not a purely transcendental extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Here's what I've got so far: Abbreviate $\\sqrt{t^3-t}$ as $u$. I've shown that the transcendence degree is 1, so the problem boils down to showing that $\\mathbb{Q}(t,u) \\supset \\mathbb{Q}(f(t,u)/g(t,u))$ strictly, for all polynomials $f,g$ in two variables. Suppose for contradiction that $\\mathbb{Q}(t,u) = \\mathbb{Q}(f(t,u)/g(t,u))$. Look at this field as $\\mathbb{Q}(t)[x]/(x^2-(t^3-t))$, with $\\bar{x}=u$. Then since $t$ and $u$ are generated by $f/g$, we have that for some polynomials $a,b,c,d$ in 1 variable, $a(\\frac{f(t,x)}{g(t,x)})/b(\\frac{f(t,x)}{g(t,x)})-t \\in (x^2-(t^3-t))$, and $c(\\frac{f(t,x)}{g(t,x)})/d(\\frac{f(t,x)}{g(t,x)}) - x \\in (x^2-(t^3-t))$. I then tried playing with degrees, but I haven't found a contradiction.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For convenience change the base field to $k=\\mathbb{C}$\n(if the extension were purely transcendental before\nthen it would be purely transcendental after).\nAs the extension has transcendence degree $1$, then\nif the extension were purely transcendental it would equal $k(x)$\nfor some $x$. Then there are nonconstant rational functions\n$f(x)$ and $g(x)$ such that\n$$g(x)^2=f(x)^3-f(x).$$ It's easy to see we can write $f(x)=u(x)/w(x)^2$\nand $g(x)=v(x)/w(x)^3$ in lowest terms\nwhere $u$, $v$ and $w$ are polynomials.\nWe find that\n$$\\phi(x)=\\frac{g'(x)}{3f(x)^2-1}=\\frac{f'(x)}{2g(x)}.$$\nIn fact $\\phi(x)$ is a polynomial. Otherwise the denominator\nof $\\phi$ has a factor $x-a$. Expressing $\\phi$ in terms of $u$, $v$\nand $w$ (details?) we see that this implies that\n$$2g(a)=3f(a)^2-1=0$$\nas well as\n$$g(a)^2=f(a)^3-f(a).$$\nThis is impossible. As $f$ and $g$ are nonconstant, $\\phi$ is a nonzero\npolynomial. Now replace $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ by $f(1/x)$ and $g(1/x)$. Then $\\phi(x)$\nis replaced by $-x^{-2}\\phi(1/x)$ so that is also a polynomial, which\nit isn't. So we get the required contradiction. Added. The above was composed in a rush, and I cut a few corners,\nso some extra details. We have $f'(x)=\\textrm{polynomial}/w(x)^3$ and so\n$$\\phi(x)=\\frac{f'(x)}{g(x)}=\\frac{\\textrm{polynomial}}{v(x)}.$$\nSimilarly\n$$\\phi(x)=\\frac{\\textrm{polynomial}}{3u(x)^2-w(x)^4}.$$\nIf $x-a$ divides the denominator of $\\phi(x)$ then $v(a)=0=u(a)^2-w(a)^4$.\nWe can't have $w(a)=0$ as then $x-a$ would divide $u(x)$ and $w(x)$\ncontrary to $u(x)/v(x)^2$ being in lowest terms. Hence $f(a)$ and $g(a)$\nmake sense and we get $g(a)=3f(a)^2-1=0$. This is really a geometric argument. On the elliptic curve\n$$E:\\quad z^2=t^3-t$$\nthe \"invariant differential\"\n$$\\omega=\\frac{dt}{2z}=\\frac{dz}{3t^2-1}$$\nwould have no poles on the (projective curve) $E$. But were $E$ rational\nthen $\\omega=\\phi(x)dx$ has no poles on the projective line; but every\nnonzero differential on the projective line has a pole. The above is just\na naive version of this argument, which works for all elliptic curves.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about showing that the field extension Q(t, sqrt(t^3 - t)) is not purely transcendental over Q when t is transcendental. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that t is transcendental over Q. That's one assumption. Then, the extension is Q(t, u) where u is sqrt(t^3 - t). The problem is to show this extension isn't purely transcendental. \n\nWait, the example given in the format had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But here, the key assumptions are that t is transcendental over Q, and perhaps that u is defined as sqrt(t^3 - t). But the user's example only lists the initial conditions, not derived ones. So maybe the assumptions here are just that t is transcendental over Q. The other part, u being sqrt(t^3 - t), is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nSo the problem is to show that Q(t, sqrt(t^3 - t)) is not purely transcendental over Q. The assumptions would be that t is transcendental over Q. That's the main given condition. The rest is part of the problem. So the formatted assumption is just \"t is transcendental over Q.\" Then the problem is as stated.\n\nI need to check if there are more assumptions. The problem might implicitly assume that sqrt(t^3 - t) is algebraic over Q(t), which is true because it satisfies x^2 - (t^3 - t) = 0. But since the problem is about the extension being not purely transcendental, the key given condition is t transcendental. So the assumption is only that t is transcendental over Q. The rest is part of the problem's construction. So I think the formatted problem should have that single assumption.",
