    "Content": "Given that $x_n$ and $y_n$ are Cauchy sequences in $\\mathbb{R} $, prove that $x_n y_n$ is Cauchy without the use of the Cauchy theorem stating that Cauchy $\\Rightarrow$ convergence. Attempt: Without that condition on not been able to use the theorem, the question becomes trivial.  Instead: For all $\\epsilon > 0$ there exists an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for $n,m \\geq N, -\\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\leq x_n - x_m \\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$ and similar statment for $y_n$. Multiply the above by $y_n$ and the equivalent statement for $y_n$ by $x_m$.  Then add these together.  The result is: $$|x_ny_n - x_my_m| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}(x_m + y_n)$$  I have proved in a previous question that $x_n + y_n$ is Cauchy so could I apply that here and say for $n,m \\geq N$, $x_n + y_n$ is Cauchy and hence convergent so tends to a finite limit for $n,m \\geq N$.  This would mean my upper bound is a multiple of $\\epsilon$ and since $\\epsilon$ is arbritarily small, so is this upper bound. Hence Cauchy. I don't think this would warrant a full proof in any case since by multiplying by $x_m$ and $y_n$, I am assuming they are positive so as to not reverse the inequality signs.  Nonetheless, I would appreciate some feedback on what I have done. Many thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "HINT: You can make the basic idea work by arranging matters a bit differently. Start with $$x_ny_n-x_my_m=(x_ny_n-x_ny_m)+(x_ny_m-x_my_m)\\;,$$ supply and manipulate absolute values appropriately, and use the fact that a Cauchy sequence is bounded. (Note that boundedness can be proved easily without actually showing convergence.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that the product of two Cauchy sequences is Cauchy without using the theorem that Cauchy implies convergence. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The question states that x_n and y_n are Cauchy sequences in R. So that's one assumption each. The problem is to prove that their product is Cauchy. But there might be more assumptions in the user's attempt? Wait, the user mentioned they tried to multiply the inequalities and ended up with |x_n y_n - x_m y_m| < (epsilon/2)(x_m + y_n). Then they used that x_n + y_n is Cauchy, hence convergent, so bounded. But the problem doesn't state that the sequences are bounded. Wait, Cauchy sequences in R are convergent, hence bounded, right? But the user is asked not to use the Cauchy theorem (i.e., not to use that Cauchy implies convergence). So maybe the user is trying to use the fact that Cauchy sequences are bounded, which can be proven without invoking convergence? Hmm.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user is to prove that x_n y_n is Cauchy given that x_n and y_n are Cauchy. So the assumptions would just be that x_n and y_n are Cauchy sequences in R. The problem is to prove their product is Cauchy. However, in the attempt, the user is trying to manipulate the inequalities and ends up with an expression involving x_m + y_n. They mention that x_n + y_n is Cauchy (which is correct), and hence convergent (but since they can't use the theorem, maybe they shouldn't reference convergence). Instead, they might need to use that Cauchy sequences are bounded. Because if Cauchy sequences are bounded, then x_m and y_n are bounded by some M, so the upper bound becomes (epsilon/2)(2M) = M*epsilon, which can be made small by choosing epsilon appropriately. \n\nWait, but the user's approach might not be entirely correct. Because multiplying the inequalities as they did might not lead to the correct bound. Let me check. The user says they have for n,m >= N, |x_n - x_m| < epsilon/2 and similarly for y_n. Then they multiply the x_n - x_m inequality by y_n and the y_n - y_m inequality by x_m? Wait, that part is a bit unclear. Let me see. Maybe they tried to write x_n y_n - x_m y_m = x_n y_n - x_m y_n + x_m y_n - x_m y_m = y_n (x_n - x_m) + x_m (y_n - y_m). Then taking absolute values, it's |y_n||x_n -x_m| + |x_m||y_n - y_m|. Since Cauchy sequences are bounded, there exists M such that |x_m| <= M and |y_n| <= M for all m,n. Then each term is <= M*(epsilon/(2M)) + M*(epsilon/(2M)) = epsilon/2 + epsilon/2 = epsilon. But this requires that the sequences are bounded, which is true in R because Cauchy sequences are bounded (without assuming convergence). \n\nBut in the user's attempt, they tried to use that x_n + y_n is Cauchy. That might not be directly helpful. The standard approach is to use the boundedness of Cauchy sequences. So perhaps the user's approach has a flaw, but the actual problem remains to structure the original question.\n\nSo the problem statement from the user's question is: Given that x_n and y_n are Cauchy sequences in R, prove that x_n y_n is Cauchy without using the Cauchy theorem (i.e., without using that Cauchy implies convergence). \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are that x_n and y_n are Cauchy sequences in R. The problem is to prove that their product is Cauchy. The user's attempt may have some errors, but the task is to structure the problem, not to evaluate the attempt. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem. The assumptions are each applied to one object: x_n is a Cauchy sequence in R, y_n is a Cauchy sequence in R. The problem is to prove that x_n y_n is Cauchy. \n\nSo the correct formatted problem would have those two assumptions and the problem statement. The user might have added an assumption about positivity, but in the original problem, there's no mention of positivity. The user's concern about inequalities reversing if they aren't positive is part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should not include any assumptions about positivity unless the original problem states so, which it doesn't. The problem is in R, so elements can be positive or negative, but the Cauchy property doesn't require positivity.",
