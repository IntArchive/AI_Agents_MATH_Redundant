    "Content": "I want to show that $\\Gamma(z)$ has no zeros. My idea is to use the formula $$\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z)=\\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$$ which holds for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$. If $\\Gamma(z)=0$, then the left-hand side is $0$ and the right-hand side isn't, so impossible. But I'm worried that it wouldn't work if $\\Gamma(1-z)=\\pm\\infty$. How to resolve this case?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A slight variation of the comment-answer by Cocopuffs: if $\\Gamma(z)=0$, then from $\\Gamma(z)=(z-1)\\Gamma(z-1)$ we find that either $z=1$ or $\\Gamma(z-1)=0$. But $\\Gamma(1)=\\int_0^\\infty e^{-t}\\,dt=1$. Hence, any zero of $\\Gamma$ propagates to the left : it creates the sequence of zeros $z-n$, $n=1,2,3,\\dots$. According to the functional equation cited in the question, this creates a sequence of poles propagating to the right. But $\\Gamma(z)=\\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t}\\,dt$  is evidently holomorphic when $\\operatorname{Re}z>0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the Gamma function has no zeros. Their approach uses the reflection formula Γ(z)Γ(1−z) = π / sin(πz). They argue that if Γ(z) were zero, then the left side would be zero, but the right side isn't, which is a contradiction. However, they're concerned about the case when Γ(1−z) might be infinite, which could potentially make the left-hand side undefined or an indeterminate form like 0·∞.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the properties of the Gamma function. The Gamma function Γ(z) is defined for all complex numbers except the non-positive integers, where it has simple poles. So Γ(z) has poles at z = 0, -1, -2, ..., but it's analytic everywhere else. Importantly, Γ(z) never equals zero; that's what we're trying to prove here.\n\nThe user's approach uses the reflection formula. Let me check the conditions under which this formula holds. The formula Γ(z)Γ(1−z) = π / sin(πz) is valid for all z not in ℤ, because sin(πz) is zero when z is an integer, and Γ(z) has poles at non-positive integers. So for z not an integer, this formula applies. \n\nNow, suppose Γ(z) = 0 for some z. Then, according to the reflection formula, the left-hand side would be 0 (since Γ(z)=0) times Γ(1−z), which would be 0·Γ(1−z). But the right-hand side is π / sin(πz), which is defined and non-zero as long as sin(πz) isn't zero or undefined. However, sin(πz) is zero when z is an integer, but in that case, Γ(z) would have a pole at non-positive integers and be defined (but not a pole) at positive integers. Wait, but Γ(z) isn't defined at non-positive integers. So if z is a non-positive integer, Γ(z) is a pole, not zero. If z is a positive integer, Γ(z) is (z-1)! which is finite and non-zero. Therefore, the right-hand side π / sin(πz) is zero only when z is an integer, but in those cases, either Γ(z) is a pole (non-positive integers) or Γ(z) is non-zero (positive integers). Therefore, the right-hand side is never zero, and it's defined except when z is an integer. \n\nBut the user's concern is about Γ(1−z) being ±∞. Let's think: if Γ(z) = 0, then to have Γ(z)Γ(1−z) = 0·∞, which is an indeterminate form. However, in the reflection formula, the product Γ(z)Γ(1−z) is supposed to equal π / sin(πz). If Γ(z) = 0, then even if Γ(1−z) is infinite, the product would have to be 0·∞, but according to the formula, it should equal a finite non-zero value (since sin(πz) is non-zero unless z is an integer, but we already covered that case). \n\nBut perhaps the key is that if Γ(z) has a zero at some point z₀, then 1−z₀ would have to be a pole of Γ, i.e., 1−z₀ must be a non-positive integer. So z₀ = 1 + k where k is a non-negative integer. Let me check: suppose z₀ = 1 + k for k ≥ 0. Then Γ(z₀) = Γ(1 + k) = k! which is finite and non-zero. Therefore, if Γ(z) has a zero at z₀, then 1−z₀ must be a pole, which would make z₀ = 1 + m for some non-negative integer m, but then Γ(z₀) is m! which isn't zero. Hence, there's a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, considering the reflection formula: if Γ(z₀) = 0, then 1−z₀ must be a pole of Γ, so 1−z₀ = -n for some non-negative integer n, which implies z₀ = 1 + n. But then Γ(z₀) = Γ(1 + n) = n! ≠ 0. Therefore, such a z₀ cannot exist. Thus, Γ(z) cannot have zeros. \n\nSo the user's initial approach is valid because even if Γ(1−z) is infinite (i.e., 1−z is a non-positive integer), z would be 1 + n for some non-negative integer n, but Γ(z) at those points is n! which isn't zero. Therefore, the case where Γ(1−z) is infinite doesn't actually occur when Γ(z) is zero. Hence, the original argument holds, and there's no need to worry about the 0·∞ indeterminate form because the two conditions (Γ(z)=0 and Γ(1−z) infinite) can't happen simultaneously. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that Γ(z) has no zeros.",
