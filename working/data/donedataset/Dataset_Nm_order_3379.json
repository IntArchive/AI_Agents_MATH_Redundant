    "Content": "Prove that any positive real number $r$ satisfying: $r - \\frac{1}{r} = 5$ must be irrational. Using the contradiction that the equation must be rational, we set $r= a/b$, where a,b are positive integers and substitute: $\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{1}{a/b}\\\\\n\n&\\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{b}{a}\\\\\n\n&\\frac{a^2}{ab} - \\frac{b^2}{ab}\\\\\n\n&\\frac{a^2-b^2}{ab}\n\\end{align*}$ I am unsure what to do next?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think your method is sound:\nif we assume by contradiction that $r=\\frac{a}{b}$ with $a,b$ integers\nwe get that\n$$\\frac{a}{b}-\\frac{b}{a}=5$$\nsince neither $b$ nor $a$ is 0, we can multiply by $ab$ and get\n$$(a-b)(a+b)=5ab$$\nnow there are three cases to investigate, i'll just point them out so you can finish it off: If $a$ and $b$ are both odd- look at both sides of the equation (mod2). If either one of them is odd and the other even- try the same trick of (mod 2) lastly- if both are even- you can divide the entire equation by 2 and continue. hope that helps",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The goal is to prove that if a positive real number r satisfies the equation r - 1/r = 5, then r must be irrational. The user attempted a proof by contradiction, assuming r is rational and setting r = a/b where a and b are positive integers with no common factors. Then they substituted into the equation and got to (a² - b²)/(ab) = 5. Now, they're stuck on what to do next.\n\nHmm, so starting from (a² - b²)/(ab) = 5, that simplifies to a² - b² = 5ab. Maybe rearrange this equation to form a quadratic in terms of a or b? Let's try rearranging:\n\na² - 5ab - b² = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor the left-hand side. Wait, a² - b² is (a - b)(a + b), but here it's a² - 5ab - b². That doesn't factor neatly. Maybe treat this as a quadratic equation in a. Let's consider a as the variable:\n\na² - 5b a - b² = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula for a, we get:\n\na = [5b ± sqrt((5b)² + 4b²)] / 2\n= [5b ± sqrt(25b² + 4b²)] / 2\n= [5b ± sqrt(29b²)] / 2\n= [5b ± b√29] / 2\n= b(5 ± √29)/2.\n\nSince a is supposed to be an integer, and b is also an integer, this would require that √29 is rational, which it's not. But wait, the original assumption is that r is rational, so a/b is rational. However, the solution for a in terms of b involves √29, which is irrational. Therefore, unless the term (5 ± √29)/2 is rational, which it isn't, this would imply that a/b can't be rational, leading to a contradiction. Hence, r must be irrational.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Starting from a² - 5ab - b² = 0. Suppose a and b are coprime. Let's see if we can find integers a and b satisfying this equation. Rearranged, a² = 5ab + b² = b(5a + b). So a² is divisible by b. Since a and b are coprime, b must divide a², but because they are coprime, b must be 1. So if b = 1, then the equation becomes a² - 5a - 1 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for a: a = [5 ± sqrt(25 + 4)]/2 = [5 ± sqrt(29)]/2. Again, sqrt(29) is irrational, so a would have to be irrational, which contradicts a being an integer. Therefore, no solution exists in integers a and b, which means r cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers, hence irrational.\n\nSo the key steps are: assume r is rational, express it as a reduced fraction a/b, substitute into the equation, derive that a and b must satisfy a quadratic equation with irrational solutions, which contradicts the assumption that a and b are integers. Therefore, the original assumption that r is rational is false.",
