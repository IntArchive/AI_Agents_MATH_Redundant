    "Content": "I have two questions which pertain to differentiability, connectivity and path connectivity. Ocasionally, I will encounter an author who defines connectivity in the following way: An open subset $U$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be connected if and only if given two points $a$ and $b$ of $U$ there exists a differentiable mapping $\\phi: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow U$ such that $\\phi(0) = a$ and $\\phi(1) = b$. This particular example is from Edward's Advanced Calculus of Several Variables p 84. Now, this is obviously not the standard definition we learn from topology which has nothing to do with differentiability but rather whether there exists two nonempty open subsets that comprise a separation. It also seems to me that what the author is really defining what it means for a space to be \"smoothly path connected\", which of course implies connectivity and, it seems to me, considerably more. My first question is: Is \"smoothly path connected\", as defined above actually equivalent to \"connected\", in the topological sense, in $\\mathbb{R}^n$? Next, in Vector Calculus by Baxandall and Liebeck on p 150 the authors state the existence of a continuous path $\\alpha$ from the closed interval $[0,1]$ to an open subset $D$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ where $\\alpha (0) = a \\in D$ and $\\alpha(1) = b \\in D$ guarantees the existence of a differentiable path with the same properties. This claim is stated without proof. My second question is: Can someone provide a reference to a proof of the above claim or explain why it is so?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proposition: Let $X$ be a locally path-connected space (in particular, any open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has this property). Then every path component of $X$ is a connected component of $X$. In particular, $X$ is connected if and only if it is path-connected. Proof. Let $U$ be a path component of $X$. If $x \\in U$, then there is an open neighborhood $V$ containing $x$ which is path-connected, hence $V \\subseteq U$. It follows that $U$ is open. If $x \\in \\bar{U}$, again choose an open neighborhood $V$ containing $x$ which is path-connected. By assumption, this neighborhood intersects $U$, so it follows that $V \\subseteq U$. Hence $U$ is closed. It follows that $U$ and its complement in its connected component $C$ are disjoint open sets whose union is $C$, hence that $U = C$. Proposition: Let $X$ be an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (or a smooth manifold). If two points $a, b$ are connected by a path in $X$, then they are connected by a smooth path in $X$. Proof. Let $\\alpha : [0, 1] \\to X$ be such a path. Choose for each point $\\alpha(t)$ an open ball $U_t$ containing $\\alpha(t)$ and contained in $X$. By compactness, the $U_t$ have a finite subcover $U_{t_1}, ... U_{t_n}$. Now it is not hard to explicitly write down a smooth path from $a$ to $b$ going through the balls $U_{t_i}$. (For example, it is trivial to write down a piecewise-linear path with this property, and then one just has to deform this path slightly in a neighborhood of each of its points of nondifferentiability using a smooth bump function .)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and format it according to the user's requirements. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, filter out unrelated information, and structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem sections based on the given example.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the original question carefully. The title is about connectivity, path connectivity, and differentiability. The user has two questions here. Let me break them down.\n\nThe first part talks about an author (Edward) defining a connected open subset U of R^n using a differentiable path between any two points. The asker is questioning whether this \"smoothly path connected\" definition is equivalent to standard topological connectedness in R^n. The second question refers to a claim in Baxandall and Liebeck's book where a continuous path between two points in an open subset D of R^n implies the existence of a differentiable path with the same endpoints. The asker wants a proof reference or explanation.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statements. The example given lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's start with the first question.\n\nAssumptions for the first problem:\n- U is an open subset of R^n.\n- U is connected (under the standard topological definition).\nOr wait, actually, the author's definition uses differentiable paths. Wait, the problem is asking whether \"smoothly path connected\" (using differentiable paths) is equivalent to connectedness in R^n. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in Edward's definition. Wait, the user is asking if Edward's definition (smoothly path connected) is equivalent to standard connectedness. So maybe the problem is to prove equivalence between the two definitions. But how to frame that?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be structured as: Given that an open subset U of R^n has for any two points a differentiable path connecting them, does that imply U is topologically connected, and vice versa? Wait, but the user's question is whether \"smoothly path connected\" (Edward's definition) is equivalent to standard connectedness. So the assumption for the problem would be that U is an open subset of R^n, and the problem is to determine if Edward's definition is equivalent to standard connectedness.\n\nBut the example given in the format has specific assumptions. Let me check the example again. The example had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a specific condition on an object. So for the first question here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nU is an open subset of R^n,\nFor any two points a and b in U, there exists a differentiable mapping φ: R → U such that φ(0) = a and φ(1) = b.\n\nProblem: Is U connected in the standard topological sense?\n\nWait, but the user's first question is whether Edward's definition (smoothly path connected) is equivalent to standard connectedness. So the problem would be phrased as proving equivalence between the two definitions. However, the example given had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". So perhaps here, the problem is a question rather than a statement to prove. The user wants to know if \"smoothly path connected\" implies connected and vice versa.\n\nBut the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". So perhaps the problem is: \"Is an open subset U of R^n that is smoothly path connected (as defined by the existence of differentiable paths between any two points) equivalent to being connected in the topological sense?\" Then the assumptions would be the conditions given in Edward's definition. Wait, but the problem is whether the two properties are equivalent. So maybe the assumptions are that U is open in R^n, and then the problem is to determine equivalence between smoothly path connectedness and connectedness.\n\nAlternatively, for each part of the problem. The user has two separate questions. Let's see the original question:\n\nFirst question: Is \"smoothly path connected\" equivalent to \"connected\" in R^n?\n\nSecond question: Does a continuous path in an open subset D of R^n imply the existence of a differentiable path with the same endpoints?\n\nSo perhaps each of these is a separate problem. The user wants both formatted.\n\nBut the user's example had one problem. But here, there are two problems. The user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", but the original question has two problems. So maybe split them into two problem sections. However, the user's example only shows one problem. Maybe we need to structure each question as a separate problem with their own assumptions.\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\nU is an open subset of R^n,\nFor every two points a, b in U, there exists a differentiable map φ: R → U with φ(0) = a and φ(1) = b.\n\nProblem: Is U connected in the topological sense?\n\nBut the actual question is whether this smoothly path connected implies connected, and vice versa. So the problem is: \"Is an open subset U of R^n that is smoothly path connected equivalent to U being topologically connected?\"\n\nBut the example uses a statement to prove. Here, it's a yes/no question. But the format might require a problem statement as a question. Let's check the example again: the problem was \"Prove that A(n)...\". So perhaps the problem here would be phrased as \"Determine whether the following are equivalent for an open subset U of R^n: (1) U is connected in the topological sense; (2) U is smoothly path connected as defined by Edward.\" But maybe that's too verbose. Alternatively, as two separate problems.\n\nAlternatively, given the problem structure, perhaps the first problem is to prove equivalence between smooth path connectedness and connectedness for open subsets of R^n. The second problem is to prove that existence of a continuous path implies existence of a differentiable path in an open subset D of R^n.\n\nBut the original user question's first part is a question about equivalence, the second is about proving that a continuous path implies a differentiable path. So let's structure them as two separate problems.\n\nBut the example given in the instruction has only one problem. The user's original question here has two. But the user's format example includes one problem. So perhaps the assistant is to structure each of the two questions as separate problems, each with their own assumptions and problem statements.\n\nFirst question:\n\nAssumptions:\nU is an open subset of R^n,\nFor any two points a, b in U, there exists a differentiable mapping φ: R → U such that φ(0) = a and φ(1) = b.\n\nProblem: Is U connected in the standard topological sense?\n\nWait, but the question is about equivalence. So maybe the problem should be phrased as: \"Prove or disprove that for an open subset U of R^n, being smoothly path connected (as defined) is equivalent to being topologically connected.\"\n\nBut the original user's first question is whether they are equivalent. So the problem is to determine this equivalence.\n\nBut the example uses \"Prove that...\". So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that an open subset U of R^n is connected if and only if it is smoothly path connected (i.e., any two points can be connected by a differentiable path).\n\nThen the assumptions would include that U is open in R^n, and the problem is the equivalence.\n\nBut the original Edward's definition is defining connectedness via differentiable paths, which is different from standard. So the user is asking whether these are equivalent. So the problem is: \"Is an open subset U of R^n connected in the standard topological sense if and only if it is smoothly path connected (as defined by Edward)?\"\n\nBut how to structure this. The example's problem starts with \"Prove that...\". Here, the problem is a question. But maybe we can structure it as \"Prove or disprove: For an open subset U of R^n, the following are equivalent: 1) U is connected; 2) U is smoothly path connected.\"\n\nThen the assumptions would be U is open in R^n. Wait, but the example had multiple assumptions. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the assumptions list all the given conditions. In this case, the problem is about equivalence, so the assumptions would be the properties that U is open in R^n. The problem is then to prove the equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, for the first problem:\n\nAssumptions:\nU is an open subset of R^n,\nIn the first direction: Assume U is smoothly path connected (for any a,b in U, there exists a differentiable path connecting them).\n\nProblem: Is U connected?\n\nThen the second part would be: If U is connected, is it smoothly path connected?\n\nBut the user's question is about equivalence. Maybe split into two problems? But the user asked two questions. Let me see.\n\nOriginal user's first question: \"Is 'smoothly path connected' ... equivalent to 'connected' ...?\" So the problem is to determine if the two are equivalent. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for an open subset U of R^n, the following are equivalent: (1) U is connected in the topological sense; (2) U is smoothly path connected (i.e., any two points can be connected by a differentiable path).\n\nAssumptions here would be U is open in R^n.\n\nSecond question: The claim is that existence of a continuous path implies existence of a differentiable path in an open subset D of R^n. So the problem is to prove that in an open subset D of R^n, if there exists a continuous path from a to b, then there exists a differentiable path with the same endpoints.\n\nAssumptions here would be D is an open subset of R^n, there exists a continuous path from a to b in D.\n\nBut the user's second question is about providing a proof or explanation for that claim. So the problem is: Prove that if there exists a continuous path between two points in an open subset D of R^n, then there exists a differentiable path between them.\n\nSo structuring these as two separate problems.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\nU is an open subset of R^n.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that U is connected in the topological sense if and only if it is smoothly path connected (i.e., any two points in U can be connected by a differentiable path).\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\nD is an open subset of R^n,\nThere exists a continuous path from a to b in D.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a differentiable path from a to b in D.\n\nBut the original problem's second question refers to the existence of a continuous path implying a differentiable one. So the problem is to prove that in an open subset D of R^n, any two points connected by a continuous path are also connected by a differentiable path. Therefore, the assumptions would be D is open in R^n, a and b are points in D, and there exists a continuous path from a to b in D.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as: Given an open subset D of R^n and two points a, b in D connected by a continuous path, prove that they are connected by a differentiable path.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor the first problem:\n\nAssumption:\nU is an open subset of R^n.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that U is topologically connected if and only if every pair of points in U can be connected by a differentiable path.\n\nFor the second problem:\n\nAssumption:\nD is an open subset of R^n,\na and b are points in D,\nThere exists a continuous path from a to b in D.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a differentiable path from a to b in D.\n\nNow, checking for each assumption to address one property or condition on one object. For the first problem, U is an open subset of R^n. That's one assumption.\n\nThe problem is to prove equivalence between connectedness and smoothly path connectedness.\n\nFor the second problem, the assumptions are D is open, a and b are points in D, and a continuous path exists between them.\n\nThus, the final formatted problems would be two separate entries. However, the user's example had only one problem. Since the original question has two parts, I think the user wants both formatted. But the original instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", which might imply per problem. Since the user's example has one problem, maybe each of the two questions should be formatted separately. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps structure each question as a separate problem in the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants each problem in a separate block. But the example had one. Hmm. But in the original problem, there are two questions. Therefore, the assistant needs to format both.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the format is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: <list>\nProblem: <the problem>\n###\n\nSo perhaps each problem is presented separately. So the answer would have two such blocks.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified whether multiple problems are allowed. However, the original problem has two questions, so it's necessary to structure both.\n\nThus, the assistant's answer would be:\n\nFirst problem block:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nU is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nProblem: \nProve or disprove that $U$ is connected in the topological sense if and only if every pair of points in $U$ can be connected by a differentiable path.\n###\n\nSecond problem block:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$D$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\n$a$ and $b$ are points in $D$,\nThere exists a continuous path from $a$ to $b$ in $D$.\nProblem: \nProve that there exists a differentiable path from $a$ to $b$ in $D$.\n###\n\nBut check if the assumptions are correctly split. For the second problem, the three assumptions: D is open, a and b are points in D, and existence of a continuous path. Each is a separate line.\n\nYes, each assumption is one property. The first line is D's openness, second line specifies a and b's location, third line the existence of a continuous path.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct formatting.",
