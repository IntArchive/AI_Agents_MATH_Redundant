    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider $$(1+x+x^2+x^3+\\cdots)(1+x+^2+x^3+\\cdots)$$ Coefficient of $x^k$ in this expansion is just $k+1.$ Because $$1.x^k+x.x^{k-1}+x^2.x^{k-2}+\\cdots+x^k.1=(k+1)x^k.$$ Therefore $$(1+x+x^2+x^3+\\cdots)^2=1+2x+3x^2+4x^3+\\cdots.$$ \nNow evaluate (you can use the same procedure) $$(1-2x+x^2)(1+2x+3x^2+4x^3+\\cdots)=?$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the sum 1 + 2x + 3x² + ... equals 1/(1 - x)² for |x| < 1. The user provided three different proofs and is asking for more methods. But my task isn't to come up with new proofs; it's to format the existing problem according to the example given.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem states \"Given |x| < 1, prove that...\" So the main assumption here is about the condition on x. The series converges only when the absolute value of x is less than 1. Therefore, the assumption is that |x| is less than 1.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is listed separately, even though they both relate to n. In this case, the only assumption is about x's absolute value. However, maybe there's another implicit assumption. Wait, the series is an infinite series, so convergence is important. The problem explicitly states |x| < 1, which is necessary for convergence. So the key assumption here is that |x| is less than 1. Are there any other assumptions? The problem mentions proving the equality, so perhaps we need to consider that the series is defined for x in the real numbers (or complex numbers, but since absolute value is mentioned, it might be real). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the only explicit assumption is |x| < 1. \n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions should list |x| < 1 as the single condition. The problem statement is to prove the given equality. So the Assumption section will have one bullet point, and the problem is to prove the sum equals 1/(1 - x)².\n\nWait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, the original problem only mentions |x| < 1. Are there any other conditions? The series is 1 + 2x + 3x² + ... which is a power series. The convergence is only assured when |x| < 1. So that's the only assumption needed here. There's no mention of x being an integer or any other property. So, yes, the assumption is |x| < 1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: |x| < 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4 + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}$$.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the example, in the original problem, the user had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each as separate bullet points. But in this case, there's only one assumption. So I should list that as a single bullet point. Also, the problem statement in the example was written as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, the problem is to prove the equality given the assumption on x.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user's example had two assumptions, but here there's only one. So the formatted problem will have one assumption and the problem statement.\n\nI need to make sure that the problem is stated correctly. The original problem says \"prove that 1+2x+3x²+... = 1/(1 - x)²\". So the problem part is exactly that statement. The assumptions are the conditions under which this equality holds, which is |x| < 1. There's no other condition mentioned. Therefore, the formatted problem is correct as above.",
