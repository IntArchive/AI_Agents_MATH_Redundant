    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will present an answer which can be (in principle, at least) understood by anyone who knows single variable calculus and the definition of a continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.  Then I will explain how to shorten the argument a little by using topological language. Step 1: Let $f: [0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function with $f(0) = f(1)$.  Then there exist $x,y \\in [0,1)$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$ and $x\\neq y$. Proof: We may assume $f$ is nonconstant.  By the Extreme Value Theorem it assumes a minimum value $m$ and a maximum value $M$ with $m < M$.  Let $x_m,x_M$ be such that \n$f(x_m) = m$ and $f(x_M) = M$.  Without loss of generality $x_m < x_M$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, every value in $(m,M)$ is assumed on the interval $(x_m,x_M)$.  Moreover, because $f(1) = f(0)$, the function $g: [x_M,1+x_m]: \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ given by $x \\mapsto f(x)$, $x_M \\leq x \\leq 1$, $x \\mapsto f(x-1)$, $1 \\leq x \\leq 1+x_m$ is continuous, with $g(x_M) = M$, $g(1+x_m) = m$, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem takes every value in $(m,M)$ on the interval $(x_M,1+x_m)$, so that $f$ takes every value in $(m,M)$ on $(x_M,1) \\cup (0,x_m) = [0,1] \\setminus [x_m,x_M]$.  Thus $f$ \ntakes every value in $(m,M)$ at least twice and is not injective on $[0,1)$. Step 2: Let $n$ be an integer greater than one, and let $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function.  Then $g: [0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ given by \n$g(t) = f(\\cos(2\\pi t),\\sin(2\\pi t),0,\\ldots,0)$ is continuous with $g(0) = g(1)$, so by Step 1 there is $0 \\leq t_0 < t_1 < 1$ such that $g(t_1) = g(t_2)$.  That is,\n$f(\\cos(2\\pi t_1),\\sin(2\\pi t_1),0,\\ldots,0) =  f(\\cos(2\\pi t_2),\\sin(2\\pi t_2),0,\\ldots,0)$, so $f$ is not injective. Step 3: A softer, more topological version of this is as follows: let $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be continuous.  Seeking a contradiction, we suppose it is injective. Let $S^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R^n}$ be the unit sphere.  Since it is compact, the restriction of $f$ \nto $S^{n-1}$ gives a homeomorphism onto its image, which is a compact, connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ hence a closed bounded interval $[a,b]$.  If $a = b$ then $f$ is constant, hence not injective.  Otherwise, observe that if we remove any one of the uncountably infinitely many points from $S^{n-1}$ we get a space homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$, which is connected if $n \\geq 2$.  However, there are only two points in $[a,b]$ whose removal leads to a connected space: the two endpoints.  Contradiction!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show that there's no continuous injective map from ℝ³ to ℝ. Hmm, I remember something about invariance of domain theorem, but maybe that's more for maps between spaces of the same dimension. Let me think... Wait, invariance of domain says that a continuous injective map from ℝⁿ to ℝⁿ is open, so it's a homeomorphism onto its image. But here the dimensions are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using connectedness or something like that. The user mentioned that if you remove a point from ℝ, it becomes disconnected, but in ℝ³, removing a point leaves it still connected. So suppose there exists a continuous injective f: ℝ³ → ℝ. Take a point a in the image, then ℝ³ \\ {f⁻¹(a)} should be connected because ℝ³ minus a point is connected. But on the other side, ℝ \\ {a} is disconnected. Since f is continuous and injective, the image of ℝ³ \\ {f⁻¹(a)} under f would be ℝ \\ {a}, which is disconnected. But continuous maps preserve connectedness, so the image should be connected. That's a contradiction. So the assumption that such a map exists must be false.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. If f is injective, then f restricted to ℝ³ \\ {f⁻¹(a)} would be injective as well, and its image is ℝ \\ {a}. But ℝ \\ {a} is disconnected, while ℝ³ \\ {point} is connected. Since continuous image of connected is connected, but ℝ \\ {a} isn't. Therefore, contradiction. Yeah, that seems right. So the key assumptions are that f is continuous and injective, and using properties of connectedness in the spaces. So the problem is to show there's no continuous injective map from ℝ³ to ℝ using these properties.\n\nNow, structuring it according to the given format. The original problem didn't mention any specific assumptions except that f is continuous and injective from ℝ³ to ℝ. The user's attempt used connectedness, so maybe the key assumptions are the properties of ℝ³ and ℝ regarding connectedness when removing a point. But in the example provided, the assumption was listing specific conditions on the objects. Here, the problem is general. Let me see the example again. The example had assumptions on n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in this problem, the main assumptions are that f is continuous and injective, and the properties of the spaces. However, the problem is to show the non-existence, so the assumptions would be the properties that lead to the contradiction.\n\nWait, the format says \"Assumption: All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\" So in this case, the problem is to show that there's no continuous injective map from ℝ³ to ℝ. The assumptions would be the properties of the spaces and the map. But the problem is asking to prove that such a map doesn't exist, so the assumptions are the given conditions. Wait, maybe the problem as stated in the user's question is: \"Show that there is no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ.\" So the assumptions here are the properties that f is continuous, injective, and the spaces involved. But since the problem is to prove non-existence, the assumptions to list would be the properties of the map (continuous and injective) and the spaces (ℝ³ and ℝ). Wait, but the problem is the statement to prove. So perhaps the Assumption section lists the given conditions of the problem. Wait, looking at the example: Original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but in the original problem, the user might have a typo or misstatement. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So it seems like maybe the example is incorrect? Or maybe the user had a different original problem. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the example is showing how to structure, even if there was a mistake. Anyway, in our case, the problem is to show there's no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ. The assumptions would be that f is a function from ℝ³ to ℝ, f is continuous, and f is injective. Each of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to show that such a map does not exist. But the problem is the statement to prove. Wait, in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So in our case, the problem would be \"Prove that there is no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ.\" So the assumptions would list the conditions on f and the spaces. But the problem is to prove the non-existence. Therefore, the Assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from ℝ³ to ℝ,\nf is continuous,\nf is injective.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a map f cannot exist.\n\nBut the user's original question might have additional context. Let me check the user's original question again. The user wrote: \"How would you show that there is no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ? I tried the approach where if a ∈ ℝ then ℝ \\ {a} is not connected so there can't exist a continuous function otherwise ℝ \\ {a} would be connected?\" So the user's attempt is using the connectedness argument. Therefore, the key assumptions here are the continuity and injectivity of f, and the properties of the spaces involved. But according to the format, the Assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. The problem is to show that such a map doesn't exist, so the only given conditions are that f is continuous and injective, and f: ℝ³ → ℝ. Therefore, each of these should be separate assumptions. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from ℝ³ to ℝ,\nf is continuous,\nf is injective.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no such map f.\n\nBut maybe more precise. Alternatively, if the problem is \"Show there is no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ,\" then the assumptions are that f is continuous, injective, and maps ℝ³ to ℝ. Each as separate points. So yes, each applied to f. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℝ³ → ℝ is a function,\nf is continuous,\nf is injective.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a function f does not exist.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement is exactly \"Prove that there is no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ,\" so the problem part would be that. But according to the example, the problem part is the exact statement. So in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's problem part is \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The assumption was n is integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps there was a miscommunication. But in our case, the original problem is to show that there is no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ. So the assumptions would be the properties of f (continuous, injective, from ℝ³ to ℝ). But maybe the problem is stated as is, and the assumptions are part of the problem. Wait, perhaps the original example was from a different problem where the user had to infer the assumptions. In our case, the problem is straightforward. The answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℝ³ → ℝ is a function,\nf is continuous,\nf is injective.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a function f does not exist.\n\nBut maybe even more precise. Let me check if the problem statement includes all necessary information. The original question says: \"How would you show that there is no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ?\" So the problem is to prove that no such map exists. Therefore, the assumptions are the existence of such a map (i.e., f is continuous, injective, and from ℝ³ to ℝ), leading to a contradiction. But according to the example, assumptions are listed as given conditions. So the correct formatting here would list each property of f as separate assumptions, then the problem is to prove that such f doesn't exist. Wait, but the problem is to show the non-existence, so the assumptions are the conditions that would lead to the contradiction. Wait, maybe the example's original problem had a missing assumption, like n divisible by 7, which the user added? Not sure. But following the example's structure, for the problem \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" the assumptions listed were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n. So maybe the example is incorrect. Anyway, following the user's instruction, I need to format the problem as per the example. So for the current problem:\n\nOriginal problem: Show there's no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℝ³ → ℝ is a function,\nf is continuous,\nf is injective.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a function f does not exist.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show non-existence, perhaps the problem statement is exactly that. But the example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" as the problem, given the assumptions. So in this case, the problem statement would be \"Prove that there is no continuous injective map f: ℝ³ → ℝ,\" with assumptions being the properties of f. But since the problem is to show the non-existence, the assumptions are the properties that such a hypothetical f would have. Therefore, the formatted problem would list those properties as assumptions and the problem is to prove their impossibility.",
