    "Content": "I am puzzled by the below exercise: Step 1: Select any number having 3 digits (all different from one another). Ex. $125$. Step 2: Now, write all possible combination of two digit number forming from selected digits. Here it is $12$,$21$,$15$,$51$,$25$,$52$. Add all of them. here, $ 12+21+15+51+25+52=176$ Step 3: Divide the addition, (here $176$) by sum of all 3 digits selected. i.e. $ \\dfrac{176}{1+2+5} = 22$. Always. Why, so? I have tried many combination, it works. Can anyone give proof and explain the reason behind this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If your original digits are $x, y, $ and $z$, then among your two-digit numbers are: two with $x$ in the ones place, two with $y$ in the ones place, two with $z$ in the ones place, two with $x$ in the tens place, two with $y$ in the tens place, and two with $z$ in the tens place. Therefore they sum to $2\\cdot 10(x+y+z)+2\\cdot(x+y+z)=22(x+y+z)$. So when you divide you are left with $22$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out why this math trick works. Let me start by understanding the problem again. The steps are: pick a 3-digit number with all different digits, form all possible two-digit combinations from those three digits, add them all up, then divide that sum by the sum of the original three digits. The result is always 22. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let me try with another example to confirm. Let's take 123. The two-digit combinations would be 12, 21, 13, 31, 23, 32. Adding those: 12+21=33, 13+31=44, 23+32=55. Total sum is 33+44+55=132. The sum of digits is 1+2+3=6. Then 132 divided by 6 is 22. Yep, works here too.\n\nAnother example: 369. Two-digit numbers: 36, 63, 39, 93, 69, 96. Sum: 36+63=99, 39+93=132, 69+96=165. Total sum: 99+132+165=396. Sum of digits: 3+6+9=18. 396/18=22. Still works. So the pattern holds.\n\nNow, why is this happening? Let's denote the three digits as a, b, c. The original number is abc, but actually, the problem doesn't care about the original number, just the digits. So the two-digit numbers formed are all permutations of two digits from a, b, c. For three digits, each pair can form two numbers: ab and ba, ac and ca, bc and cb. So for each pair, there are two numbers.\n\nSo the total sum would be (ab + ba) + (ac + ca) + (bc + cb). Let's express each two-digit number as 10 times the first digit plus the second. So ab = 10a + b, ba = 10b + a, similarly for the others.\n\nCalculating each pair:\nab + ba = (10a + b) + (10b + a) = 11a + 11b = 11(a + b)\nSimilarly, ac + ca = (10a + c) + (10c + a) = 11a + 11c = 11(a + c)\nAnd bc + cb = (10b + c) + (10c + b) = 11b + 11c = 11(b + c)\n\nSo total sum = 11(a + b) + 11(a + c) + 11(b + c) = 11[ (a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) ].\n\nLet's simplify the expression inside the brackets: (a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) = 2a + 2b + 2c = 2(a + b + c)\n\nSo total sum = 11 * 2(a + b + c) = 22(a + b + c)\n\nTherefore, when we divide the total sum by (a + b + c), we get 22(a + b + c) / (a + b + c) = 22. As long as the sum of the digits (a + b + c) is not zero, which it can't be because all digits are different and we're dealing with a 3-digit number, so each digit is at least 0 (but since it's a 3-digit number, the first digit can't be zero). Wait, actually, the problem states \"any number having 3 digits (all different from one another)\". So the first digit can't be zero, but the other digits can be? Wait, the problem says \"all different from one another\", which might imply that none are the same, but doesn't explicitly say they can't include zero. However, if one of the digits is zero, then when forming two-digit numbers, some numbers would start with zero, which isn't a valid two-digit number. But the original problem statement doesn't mention excluding zero. Hmm, maybe there's an oversight here.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the example given is 125, which has digits 1, 2, 5—none are zero. So perhaps the problem assumes that all digits are non-zero. Otherwise, if a digit is zero, say the number is 102, then forming two-digit numbers would include 10, 12, 02, 20, 21, 01. But 02 and 01 are not valid two-digit numbers, so maybe the problem implicitly assumes that digits are non-zero. Let me check.\n\nIf the number has a zero, say 102, then forming all possible two-digit combinations would exclude numbers starting with zero. Wait, the problem says \"all possible combination of two-digit numbers forming from selected digits\". If digits are 1, 0, 2, then the combinations would be 10, 12, 02, 20, 21, 01. But 02 and 01 are not two-digit numbers. So perhaps in such a case, those numbers are excluded? But the problem statement in the example included all permutations. For example, in 125, all two-digit combinations are listed, including those starting with each digit. So if there's a zero, like in 102, do we include 02 and 01? If so, then those would be considered as two-digit numbers, but 02 is actually 2, which is a single-digit number. Therefore, maybe the problem assumes that the original number has all non-zero digits. The original problem says \"any number having 3 digits (all different from one another)\". In standard terms, a 3-digit number can't have a leading zero, but the other digits can. However, if the digits include zero, forming two-digit numbers would have some leading zeros, which are invalid. Therefore, the problem might implicitly assume that the digits are non-zero. Let me verify this.\n\nSuppose the number is 102. Then, according to the problem's steps, we form all possible two-digit combinations: 10, 12, 02, 20, 21, 01. But 02 and 01 are not valid two-digit numbers. So if we exclude them, we have 10, 12, 20, 21. Then the sum would be 10 +12 +20 +21 =63. Sum of digits is 1+0+2=3. 63/3=21, which is not 22. But the problem states it always gives 22. Therefore, the original problem must assume that all digits are non-zero. Therefore, in the assumptions, we need to specify that the three-digit number has all non-zero digits and all distinct digits.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The number is a three-digit number.\n- All three digits are distinct.\n- All three digits are non-zero.\n\nUnder these conditions, when we form all two-digit permutations (each pair in both orders), sum them, and divide by the sum of the digits, we get 22.\n\nSo the algebraic proof as I did earlier shows that regardless of the digits a, b, c (as long as they are non-zero and distinct), the sum of all two-digit permutations is 22(a + b + c), hence dividing by (a + b + c) gives 22.\n\nTherefore, the problem relies on the fact that each pair contributes 11 times the sum of the two digits, and there are three such pairs, leading to 22 times the total sum of digits.",
