    "Content": "Can anyone help me with this problem? Let $f:[0,\\infty)\\longrightarrow \\mathbb R$ be a continuous function such that for each $x>0$, we have $\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}f(nx)=0$. Then prove that $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty}f(x)=0$. Our teacher told first to prove Baire's theorem, and then show that this is a consequence of that theorem. I proved Baire's theorem, and I spend a few hours thinking on how Baire's theorem is related to this problem, but I couldn't find anything. I'd really appreciate your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix $\\epsilon>0$ and put $F_n:=\\left\\{x\\geq 0,\\forall k\\geq n, |f(kx)|\\leqslant \\varepsilon\\right\\}$. Then for all $n$ $F_n$ is closed since $f$ is continuous and $\\bigcup_n F_n=[0,+\\infty[$. By Baire's theorem we can find $x_0\\geq 0$, $r>0$ and $n_0$ such that $]x_0-r,x_0+r[\\subset F_{n_0}$. \nPut $t_0:=n_1x_0$ where $n_1$ is an integer $\\geqslant n_0$ and such that $\\frac{x_0}{n_1}<r$. Take $x\\geq t_0$. Then we can write $x=n_xx_0+\\beta$ where $n_x$ is an integer $\\geqslant n_1$ and $0\\leqslant \\beta<x_0$. So \n$$|f(x)|=\\left|f(n_xx_0+\\beta)\\right|=\\left|f\\left(n_x\\left(x_0+\\frac{\\beta}{n_x}\\right)\\right)\\right|\\leqslant \\varepsilon$$\nsince $n_x\\geqslant n_1$ and $x_0+\\frac{\\beta}{n_x}\\in ]x_0-r,x_0+r[\\subset F_{n_0}$\n(this because $\\left|\\frac{\\beta}{n_x}\\right|\\leqslant \\frac{x_0}{n_x}\\leqslant \\frac{x_0}{n_1}<r$). So we have shown that given a $\\varepsilon>0$, we can find $t_0$ such that for $x\\geqslant t_0$, $|f(x)|\\leq\\varepsilon$. The result is more easy to establish when $f$ is supposed to be uniformly continuous on $[0,+\\infty[$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the specified format. The original question is about proving that if a continuous function f on [0, ∞) satisfies that for every x > 0, the limit of f(nx) as n approaches infinity is 0, then the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is also 0. The user mentions that the teacher suggested using Baire's theorem, so that's a key hint.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions one by one. The function f is defined on [0, ∞), it's continuous, and for each x > 0, the limit of f(nx) as n goes to infinity is 0. Each of these should be separate assumptions. The problem is to prove that the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is 0.\n\nWait, the original problem statement mentions f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is continuous. The condition is for each x > 0, lim_{n→∞} f(nx) = 0. The goal is to show lim_{x→∞} f(x) = 0. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. The domain of f is [0, ∞).\n2. f is continuous.\n3. For each x > 0, the limit as n approaches infinity of f(nx) is 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to f. The problem is to prove the limit statement. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single property. So here, similarly, each condition on f should be a separate bullet point. The problem statement is to prove lim_{x→∞} f(x) = 0.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The function is real-valued, continuous, defined on [0, ∞), and for each positive x, the sequence f(nx) tends to 0 as n becomes large. So yes, those are the key points. So the formatted problem should list these three assumptions and then state the problem.",
