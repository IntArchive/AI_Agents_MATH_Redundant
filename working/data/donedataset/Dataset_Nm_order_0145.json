    "Content": "Suppose $E/F$ is a field extension and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in E$ are algebraic over $F$. Then it is not too hard to see that when $\\alpha$ is nonzero, $1/\\alpha$ is also algebraic. If $a_0 + a_1\\alpha + \\cdots + a_n \\alpha^n = 0$, then dividing by $\\alpha^{n}$ gives $$a_0\\frac{1}{\\alpha^n} + a_1\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{n-1}} + \\cdots + a_n = 0.$$ Is there a similar elementary way to show that $\\alpha + \\beta$ and $\\alpha \\beta$ are also algebraic (i.e. finding an explicit formula for a polynomial that has $\\alpha + \\beta$ or $\\alpha\\beta$ as its root)? The only proof I know for this fact is the one where you show that $F(\\alpha, \\beta) / F$ is a finite field extension and thus an algebraic extension.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The relevant construction is the Resultant of two polynomials. If $x$ and $y$ are algebraic and $P(x) = Q(y) = 0$ and $\\deg Q=n$ then $z=x+y$ is a root of the resultant of $P(x)$ and $Q(z-x)$ (where we take this resultant by regarding $Q$ as a polynomial in only $x$) and $t=xy$ is a root of the resultant of $P(x)$ and $x^n Q(t/x).$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's instructions. First, I need to read through the problem carefully and identify all the assumptions. The question is about proving that the sum and product of two algebraic numbers are algebraic. \n\nThe original problem mentions a field extension E/F, with α and β in E being algebraic over F. The user wants to know if there's an elementary way to show α + β and αβ are algebraic, similar to how you can show 1/α is algebraic by manipulating the minimal polynomial. The user also mentions that the usual proof uses the fact that F(α, β)/F is a finite extension, hence algebraic.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. E/F is a field extension. (This is given in the problem statement.)\n2. α and β are elements of E. (Stated as α, β ∈ E.)\n3. α is algebraic over F. (Given explicitly.)\n4. β is algebraic over F. (Also given explicitly.)\n5. The user is looking for an explicit polynomial for α + β and αβ. (This is part of the problem request.)\n\nWait, but in the example provided, assumptions are listed as properties applied to one object each. So each assumption should be a single condition on a single object. Let me parse that.\n\nThe problem states that α and β are algebraic over F. So each is a separate assumption. The field extension E/F is another assumption. The question is asking for a proof of the algebraicity of α + β and αβ, with a request for an explicit polynomial. The user already knows the proof using field extensions but wants an elementary method.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- E is a field extension of F.\n- α is an element of E algebraic over F.\n- β is an element of E algebraic over F.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the user's instruction had two separate lines for n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. Here, maybe we need to list each property separately. So:\n\nAssumption: E/F is a field extension.\n\nAssumption: α ∈ E.\n\nAssumption: α is algebraic over F.\n\nAssumption: β ∈ E.\n\nAssumption: β is algebraic over F.\n\nBut maybe that's splitting hairs. Alternatively, combine the conditions for α and β. But according to the example, each assumption should be a single property on one object. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So here, \"α is algebraic over F\" and \"β is algebraic over F\" would be separate assumptions. The fact that they're elements of E is also separate.\n\nSo the Assumption section would be:\n\nAssumption: E/F is a field extension.\n\nAssumption: α ∈ E.\n\nAssumption: β ∈ E.\n\nAssumption: α is algebraic over F.\n\nAssumption: β is algebraic over F.\n\nBut the original problem says \"α, β ∈ E are algebraic over F.\" So perhaps we can split into two assumptions: one for α being in E and algebraic, and same for β. However, the user's example splits even if both apply to the same object. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines. So similarly, here, each condition for α and β would be separate. So:\n\nAssumption: E/F is a field extension.\n\nAssumption: α is an element of E.\n\nAssumption: β is an element of E.\n\nAssumption: α is algebraic over F.\n\nAssumption: β is algebraic over F.\n\nThat seems to follow the format, each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition on one object.\n\nThen the problem is: Show that α + β and αβ are algebraic over F by finding explicit polynomials for which they are roots, similar to the method shown for 1/α.\n\nThe original question's problem is to find an explicit polynomial for α + β and αβ, not just to prove they are algebraic. The user knows the field extension proof but wants an elementary method with explicit construction.\n\nSo the Problem part should state that: Show that α + β and αβ are algebraic over F by finding explicit polynomials (i.e., provide an explicit formula for such polynomials).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: E/F is a field extension.\nAssumption: α is an element of E.\nAssumption: β is an element of E.\nAssumption: α is algebraic over F.\nAssumption: β is algebraic over F.\nProblem: Show that α + β and α β are algebraic over F by finding an explicit polynomial for each that has α + β or α β as a root.",
