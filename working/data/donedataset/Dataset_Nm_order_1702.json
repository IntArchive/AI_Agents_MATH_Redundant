    "Content": "What are some examples of functions or quantities relating to functions (e.g., limits) $f:A \\to B$ where $A$, $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ that require by-hand, \"analytical\" methods for analysis which are seemingly contradicted by a graph generated by software ? For instance, I recall that a Pre-calculus text stated that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 0}\\dfrac{1-\\cos x^{6}}{x^{12}} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ (which, if I recall correctly, is proven using Taylor series) but the graph itself seems to suggest that it perhaps doesn't exist, due to the oscillations occurring around 0. [Graphs were generated via WolframAlpha.]",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Almost any example of catastrophic cancellation plus enough zoom will do the trick. Two cases: A simplification of your example (simpler function, bigger zoom): $$\\frac{(1-\\cos(x^2))}{x^4},\\qquad x\\in[-0.001,0.001]$$ A rational function with a removable discontinuity:\n$$\\frac{x^{50}-1}{x-1},\\qquad x\\in[0.999999999,1.000000001]$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows breaking down the original problem into assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nThe original question is about functions where analytical methods give one result, but graphs can be misleading. The example given is the limit as x approaches 0 of (1 - cos(x⁶))/x¹² being 1/2 analytically, but the graph oscillates a lot near zero, making it look like the limit might not exist.\n\nSo, first, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single condition or property applied to one object. Let's parse the question.\n\nThe problem is asking for examples where graphs (from software) are deceptive. The specific example mentioned is a function f: A → B with A, B subsets of R. The analytical methods (like Taylor series) show the limit is 1/2, but the graph seems to suggest the limit doesn't exist due to oscillations.\n\nAssumptions here would be:\n- f(x) = (1 - cos(x⁶))/x¹²\n- The domain A is a subset of R where x is near 0 (since the limit is x→0)\n- The software-generated graph (e.g., WolframAlpha) shows oscillations around 0\n- Analytical methods (like Taylor series) are used to compute the limit\n- The analytical limit is 1/2\n- The graph's oscillations suggest the limit might not exist\n\nEach of these should be separate lines. Then the problem statement is to show that despite the graph's appearance, the limit is 1/2, requiring analytical methods.\n\nWait, but the original problem is more general: asking for examples of such functions where graphs are deceiving. But the example given is specific. However, the user wants the problem structured as per the example. In the example, the original problem mentioned a specific function and its limit, so the formatted problem focused on that specific case.\n\nBut the actual question on Math Stack Exchange is a general one, asking for examples. However, the user's example took a specific problem from the original and structured it. So perhaps here, we need to extract the specific example from the question and format it, rather than the general question.\n\nYes, because the example given by the user took the specific case from the original problem. The original problem in the example was a general \"prove for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems off. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which would restrict the problem. Maybe there was a mistake in the example, but regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the Math Stack Exchange question is general, but the user wants me to structure the problem as per the example. The example extracted a specific instance from the original problem. So perhaps here, the user wants me to structure the specific example given in the question, not the general question.\n\nYes, because the user's example took a specific case from the original problem (even though the original problem was general). Wait, no. The original problem in the example was to prove for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, the current task is to take the Math Stack Exchange question provided and format it as per the example.\n\nThe Math Stack Exchange question is asking for examples of functions where analytical methods are needed, and graphs are misleading. The example given is the limit of (1 - cos x⁶)/x¹² as x→0 is 1/2, but the graph suggests otherwise.\n\nSo the formatted problem should focus on this specific example. Thus, the assumptions would be about the function, the analytical method used (Taylor series), the software-generated graph showing oscillations, and the problem is to show that despite the graph, the limit is 1/2.\n\nBut the original problem is asking for such examples, but the example given is a specific case. So perhaps the formatted problem should be about that specific case, as per the example.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = (1 - cos(x⁶))/x¹²\n\n- x approaches 0\n\n- The limit is computed analytically using Taylor series\n\n- The software-generated graph (e.g., WolframAlpha) shows oscillations near x=0\n\n- The oscillations suggest the limit might not exist\n\nEach of these would be separate lines in assumptions. Then the problem is to prove that the limit is indeed 1/2 despite the graph's appearance.\n\nYes, that seems right. So putting it all together.",
