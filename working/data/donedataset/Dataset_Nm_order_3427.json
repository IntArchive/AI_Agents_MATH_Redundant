    "Content": "The twisted cubic is the image of the morphism $\\phi : \\mathbb{P}^1 \\to \\mathbb{P}^3 , (x:y) \\mapsto (x^3:x^2 y:x y^2:y^3)$, it is given by $X = V(ad-bc,b^2-ac,c^2-bd)$. Now I would like to compute $I(X)$, which equals by the Nullstellensatz the radical of the ideal $I := (ad-bc,b^2-ac,c^2-bd) \\subseteq k[a,b,c,d]$. I think that that $I$ is already a radical ideal, even a prime ideal. Namely, I suspect that \n$$\\phi^* : Q:=k[a,b,c,d]/I \\to k[s,t] , a \\mapsto s^3, b \\mapsto s^2 t , c \\mapsto s t^2 , d \\mapsto t^3$$\nis an injection. If this is true: How can we prove that? I've already tried to find a $k$-basis of the quotient, but this turned out to be a big mess. Even the representation of the quotient as a monoid algebra doesn't seem to help. Another idea is the following: A formal manipulation of generators and relations implies $Q_a \\cong k[a,b]_a$. Thus it suffices to prove that $Q \\to Q_a$ is injective, i.e. that $a$ is not a zero divisor.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a purely algebraic proof that $I(X)=I$. It is of course sufficient to prove that $I(X) \\subset I$ and for that it suffices to prove that every homogeneous polynomial $P(a,b,c,d)$ \nwhich vanishes on $X$ is in $I$. Lemma Any homogeneous  polynomial $P(a,b,c,d)\\in k[a,b,c,d]$ can be written $$P(a,b,c,d)=R(a,d) +S(a,d)b+T(a,d)c+i(a,b,c,d)  $$  for some polynomials $R,S,T\\in k[a,d]$\n and a polynomial $i\\in I$ The easy proof is by induction on the degree of $P$ and I'll leave it to you. Now  back to our problem. If now that homogeneous $P$ is in $ I(X)$ , we write it as in the lemma and  get by using that $P$ vanishes on $X$ that for all $(x:y)\\in \\mathbb P^1_k$   $$0=P(x^3,x^2y,xy^2,y^3)=R(x^3,y^3) +S(x^3,y^3)x^2y+T(x^3,y^3)xy^2+0 $$ By considering exponents modulo $3$ for $x$ and $y$, we see that no cancellation occurs, hence  that $R=S=T=0$ and thus  $P=i\\in I$ as required.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem about the twisted cubic and its ideal according to the given structure. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is talking about the twisted cubic being the image of a morphism ϕ from P^1 to P^3. They mention that the twisted cubic is given by X = V(ad - bc, b² - ac, c² - bd). The goal is to compute I(X), which by the Nullstellensatz is the radical of the ideal I = (ad - bc, b² - ac, c² - bd) in k[a,b,c,d]. The user suspects that I is already a radical ideal, even prime, and wants to prove that the map ϕ* from Q = k[a,b,c,d]/I to k[s,t] defined by sending a to s³, b to s²t, etc., is injective. They tried some methods but found them messy and are looking for another approach, mentioning that Q_a is isomorphic to k[a,b]_a and that it's sufficient to show a is not a zero divisor.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The twisted cubic X is the image of the morphism ϕ: P^1 → P^3 defined by (x:y) ↦ (x³: x² y : x y² : y³).\n2. X is given by V(ad - bc, b² - ac, c² - bd).\n3. The ideal I is (ad - bc, b² - ac, c² - bd) ⊆ k[a,b,c,d].\n4. By the Nullstellensatz, I(X) is the radical of I.\n5. The user suspects that I is a radical ideal (even prime).\n6. There's a ring homomorphism ϕ*: Q = k[a,b,c,d]/I → k[s,t] defined by a ↦ s³, b ↦ s²t, c ↦ st², d ↦ t³.\n7. The user wants to prove ϕ* is injective.\n8. They mention that Q_a ≅ k[a,b]_a and that it's enough to show a is not a zero divisor in Q.\n\nBut wait, the assumptions should only include the given conditions of the problem, not the user's attempts or thoughts. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- ϕ: P¹ → P³ is defined by (x:y) ↦ (x³:x²y:xy²:y³).\n- X is the image of ϕ.\n- X = V(ad - bc, b² - ac, c² - bd).\n- I = (ad - bc, b² - ac, c² - bd) ⊆ k[a,b,c,d].\n- Q = k[a,b,c,d]/I.\n- ϕ*: Q → k[s,t] is defined by a ↦ s³, b ↦ s²t, c ↦ st², d ↦ t³.\n\nProblem: Prove that ϕ* is injective.\n\nBut the original problem is to compute I(X) which is the radical of I, and the user's approach is to show I is radical by showing ϕ* is injective. So perhaps the problem as structured should be to prove that I is a prime ideal (hence radical) by showing ϕ* is injective. But the user states \"Prove that ϕ* is an injection. If this is true: How can we prove that?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that ϕ* is injective, given the assumptions. The user's ultimate goal is to show I is prime (hence radical) so that I(X) = I. But the immediate problem posed is proving the injectivity of ϕ*.\n\nSo in the Assumptions section, list all the given conditions. Each as a separate line. Then the problem is the question they need answered.\n\nLet me structure that:\n\nAssumption:\nϕ: ℙ¹ → ℙ³ is defined by (x:y) ↦ (x³:x²y:xy²:y³),\nX is the image of ϕ,\nX is given by V(ad - bc, b² - ac, c² - bd),\nI is the ideal (ad - bc, b² - ac, c² - bd) in k[a,b,c,d],\nQ is the quotient ring k[a,b,c,d]/I,\nϕ*: Q → k[s,t] is the ring homomorphism defined by a ↦ s³, b ↦ s²t, c ↦ st², d ↦ t³.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ϕ* is injective.\n\nI think that's the correct breakdown. Each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object or condition. The problem is to prove injectivity of ϕ*, which would help show I is prime, hence radical, leading to I(X) = I.",
