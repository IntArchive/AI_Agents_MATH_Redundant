    "Content": "Let $\\varphi$ be the Euler's function, i.e. $\\varphi(n)$ stands for the number of integers $m \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ such that $\\text{gcd}(m,n)=1$. Let $n\\ge 2$ be a positive integer.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "In the following $p$ will always denote a prime numer. $p_k$ will be the $k$-th prime.\nClearly it suffices to show that, given $0\\le x_i<y_i\\le\\alpha$ ($i=0,\\dots,n$), we can always find $x$ s.t. $\\phi(x+i)\\in(x_i,y_i)$ for any $i$.\nHere $\\alpha:=\\prod_{p\\le n+1}\\frac{p-1}{p}$. We first prove this crucial lemma, which in particular gives the thesis for $n=0$: Lemma. Given $0\\le x<y\\le 1$ and any $z\\in\\mathbb{N}$, there exists a set $A$ of primes $>z$ s.t. $m:=\\prod_{p\\in A}p$ satisfies $x<\\frac{\\phi(m)}{m}<y$. We remember that $\\frac{\\phi(m)}{m}=\\prod_{p\\in A}\\frac{p-1}{p}$. Proof. Pick any prime $p_k>z$ s.t. $\\frac{p_k-1}{p_k}>x$. Since $\\prod_p\\frac{p-1}{p}=0$ (which follows from the well-known divergence of $\\sum_p\\frac{1}{p}$) there exists a maximal $\\ell\\ge k$ s.t. $\\prod_{j=k}^\\ell\\frac{p_j-1}{p_j}>x$. Put all the primes $p_k,\\dots,p_\\ell$ in the set $A$\nand look for another $k'>\\ell$ s.t. $\\left(\\prod_{j=k}^\\ell\\frac{p_j-1}{p_j}\\right)\\frac{p_{k'}-1}{p_{k'}}>x$ and again\nthere is a maximal $\\ell'\\ge k'$ for which\n$$\\left(\\prod_{j=k}^\\ell\\frac{p_j-1}{p_j}\\right)\\left(\\prod_{j=k'}^{\\ell'}\\frac{p_j-1}{p_j}\\right)>x$$\nholds. Add $p_{k'},\\dots,p_{\\ell'}$ to $A$ and iterate this procedure. After a finite number of steps we will obtain the desired $A$ since\n$\\frac{p-1}{p}\\to 1$ as $p\\to\\infty$ (so if a positive real number $t$ is such that $t>x$ and $t\\frac{p-1}{p}\\le x$, for some large $p$,\nwe will have $t<y$). $\\blacksquare$ Set $q:=\\prod_{p\\le n+1}q$. Applying the lemma $n+1$ times, we find disjoint sets $A_0,\\dots,A_n$ of primes $>n+1$ such that, calling $s_i:=\\prod_{p\\in A_i}p$,\nwe have $x_i\\frac{(q,i)}{\\phi((q,i))}<\\frac{\\phi(s_i)}{s_i}<y_i\\frac{(q,i)}{\\phi((q,i))}$. Here $(q,i)=\\text{gcd}(q,i)$.\nThis can be done since $\\frac{(q,i)}{\\phi((q,i))}\\le\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$, while $x_i,y_i\\le \\alpha$. The reason for this choice of the intervals will be apparent in a moment. Now let $M$ be very large and call $B$ the set of primes $p_j>n+1$ with $j\\le M$ which do not belong to any $A_i$, i.e.\n$$B:=\\{p_j\\mid j\\le M\\}\\setminus\\left(\\{1,\\dots,n+1\\}\\cup\\bigcup_{i=0}^n A_i\\right),$$\nand set $b:=\\prod_{p\\in B}p$.\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem allows us to solve this system of congruences:\n$$\\begin{cases}x\\equiv 0\\pmod{qs_0} \\\\ x+i\\equiv 0\\pmod{s_i}\\ \\forall i=1,\\dots,n \\\\ x-1\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}\\end{cases}$$\nWe claim that, for $M$ big enough, the smallest positive solution $x$ of this system is the one we are looking for.\nIn fact, if $p\\mid x+i$ (for any $i=0,\\dots,n$), then there are three cases: $p\\le n+1$ $p\\in A_i$ $p=p_j$ for some $j>M$. There are no other possibilities (otherwise $p\\in A_{i'}$ for some $i'\\neq i$ or $p\\in B$; so $p\\mid x+i'$ or $p\\mid x-1$ but none of these is possible,\nas $p$ would then divide a number $\\le n+1$).\nNotice that for the first two cases the suitable converse holds, i.e. every prime in $A_i$ divides $x+i$, while every prime $p\\le n+1$ divides $x+i$ iff $p\\mid i$, thanks to the fact that $p\\mid q\\mid x$. Thus $$\\frac{\\phi(x+i)}{x+i}=\\prod_{p\\mid (q,i)}\\frac{p-1}{p}\\prod_{p\\in A_i}\\frac{p-1}{p}\\prod_{p_j\\mid x+i,\\ j>M}\\frac{p_j-1}{p_j}$$\nand $\\prod_{p\\mid (q,i)}\\frac{p-1}{p}=\\frac{\\phi((q,i))}{(q,i)}$, so by the estimates satisfied by $s_i$ we get\n$$\\prod_{p\\mid (q,i)}\\frac{p-1}{p}\\prod_{p\\in A_i}\\frac{p-1}{p}=\\frac{\\phi((q,i))}{(q,i)}s_i\\in(x_i,y_i).$$\nTo conclude we just have to show that the last product tends to $1$ as $M\\to \\infty$. But by minimality $x<\\prod_{j=1}^M p_j$, so\n(for $M$ large) $x+i<\\prod_{j=1}^{M+1} p_j$, thus $x+i$ has at most $M$ distinct prime factors.\nSo\n$$1\\ge \\prod_{p_j\\mid x+i,\\ j>M}\\frac{p_j-1}{p_j}=\\prod_{p_j\\mid x+i,\\ j>M}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{p_j}\\right)\\ge\\left(1-\\frac{1}{p_M}\\right)^M$$\nand hence\n$$\\liminf_{M\\to\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{p_M}\\right)^M\\ge\\liminf_{M\\to\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{aM}\\right)^M=e^{-\\frac{1}{a}}$$\nfor any $a>0$, where we used the very loose estimate $p_M\\ge aM$ (for $M$ big enough depending on $a$). Sending $a\\to\\infty$ we get\n$\\liminf_{M\\to\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{p_M}\\right)^M\\ge 1$, which gives $\\lim_{M\\to\\infty}\\prod_{p_j\\mid x+i,\\ j>M}\\frac{p_j-1}{p_j}=1$ (note that $x$ depends on $M$!). This also shows the result mentioned by Erick Wong in the comments.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by understanding the original question. The user wants to show that for any positive integer n ≥ 2, there are infinitely many x such that the Euler's totient function φ applied to x, x+1, ..., x+n gives a strictly increasing sequence. The original example mentioned n=2 from a math contest, but this is a generalization.\n\nFirst, listing the assumptions. The problem states \"for all n there exists x...\" So the assumptions should cover the conditions given. Let's parse the problem sentence by sentence.\n\n1. \"Let φ be the Euler's function, i.e. φ(n) stands for the number of integers m ∈ {1,...,n} such that gcd(m,n)=1.\" This defines φ as Euler's totient function. So an assumption is that φ is Euler's totient function.\n\n2. \"Let n ≥ 2 be a positive integer.\" So the next assumption is that n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n\n3. The problem asks to show there exists infinitely many x such that φ(x) < φ(x+1) < ... < φ(x+n). The conclusion to prove is about the existence of infinitely many x starting points where the totient function increases strictly over n+1 consecutive numbers.\n\nWait, the example given in the original problem had some assumptions, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the user hasn't specified any divisibility conditions on x or n beyond n being at least 2. So maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- φ is Euler's totient function.\n- n is an integer.\n- n is greater than or equal to 2.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So φ being Euler's function is one assumption. Then n is an integer and n ≥ 2 might be two separate assumptions. Wait, but n is given as a positive integer in the problem statement. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is Euler's totient function,\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2.\n\nProblem: Show that there exist infinitely many integers x such that φ(x) < φ(x+1) < … < φ(x+n).\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no. Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" but then the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\"\n\nWait, that seems conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the original problem had a different statement. Wait, perhaps the original problem actually had some conditions that n is divisible by 7, but maybe the user wrote it incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the example is illustrative but not exact. Hmm.\n\nBut regardless, according to the user's instructions, the task is to filter the problem and list all assumptions. So in the current problem, the user states \"Let n ≥ 2 be a positive integer.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- φ is Euler's totient function.\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n is at least 2.\n\nThe problem is to show that there are infinitely many x such that φ(x) < φ(x+1) < … < φ(x+n).\n\nSo I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So φ is defined as Euler's totient function. Then n is an integer. Then n is greater than or equal to 2. Then the problem statement.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, n is given as a positive integer, so \"n is a positive integer\" is another assumption, but maybe \"n ≥ 2\" already implies that it's a positive integer. But to be precise, maybe split into two: \"n is a positive integer,\" and \"n ≥ 2.\" But perhaps in the problem statement, \"Let n ≥ 2 be a positive integer\" combines both. So maybe the assumptions should be:\n\n- φ is Euler's totient function.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- n ≥ 2.\n\nBut each assumption is one line. So that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nφ is Euler's totient function,\nn is a positive integer,\nn ≥ 2.\nProblem:\nShow that there exist infinitely many integers x such that φ(x) < φ(x+1) < … < φ(x+n).\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for all n there exists x...\", but the problem statement is \"Show that there exists infinitely many x for which φ(x) < ... < φ(x+n).\" So the problem is to show that, given n ≥ 2, there are infinitely many x such that the sequence from x to x+n is strictly increasing in φ.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the assumptions are as above. The problem is as stated.",
