    "Content": "I'm learning Complex Analysis and need to verify my work to this problem since my textbook does not provide any solution: If $f$ is entire and $\\lim_\\limits{z\\to\\infty} \\dfrac{f(z)}{z} = 0$ show that $f$ is constant. My work and thoughts: From the $\\varepsilon$ — $\\delta$ definition of the limit we have that  $$\\forall{\\varepsilon} > 0, \\exists{n_0} \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\forall{\\left|z\\right|} \\geq n: \\left| \\frac{f(z)}{z} \\right| < \\varepsilon \\iff \\frac{\\left| f(z) \\right|}{\\left| z \\right|} < \\varepsilon\\iff \\left| f(z) \\right| < \\varepsilon \\left| z \\right|.$$ Now let $C_R = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\left| z \\right| = R \\}$. For every $\\left| z \\right| < R$, by Cauchy's integral formula for derivatives we have that $$ \\left| f'(z) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi } \\left| \\int_{|\\zeta|=R} \\frac{f(\\zeta)}{(\\zeta - z)^2} \\, d\\zeta \\right|= \\frac{1}{2 \\pi } \\left| \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{f(\\zeta)}{(\\zeta - z)^2} \\, \\zeta'(t) dt \\right| \\le$$ $$\\le \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\varepsilon \\left| z \\right|}{(R - \\left| z \\right|)^2} 2\\pi R = \\frac{\\varepsilon \\left| z \\right|}{(R - \\left| z \\right|)^2} R.$$ Thus, letting $R \\rightarrow \\infty$ yields the desired result, that is  $$\\left| f'(z) \\right| \\leq \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\varepsilon \\left| z \\right|}{(R - \\left| z \\right|)^2} R = 0 \\implies f(z) = c \\;\\; \\text{with} \\; c \\in \\mathbb{C}.$$ Is my work correct? Are there parts of the proof that need improvements? I'm also looking for other (possibly quicker) solutions using the  \"big guns\" theorems. The only one I'm familiar with is Picard's little theorem but it doesn't apply here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a flaw in the proof.  Note that for the given $\\epsilon>0$, $|f(z)|<\\epsilon |z|$ for $|z|>n_0$. Therefore, on $|\\zeta|=R$, $|f(\\zeta)|<\\epsilon |\\zeta|=\\epsilon R$.  Then, we can write for $R>z$ $$\\begin{align}\n|f'(z)|&=\\left|\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint_{|\\zeta|=R}\\frac{f(\\zeta)}{(\\zeta-z)^2}\\,d\\zeta\\right|\\\\\\\\\n&\\le \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\frac{\\epsilon R}{(R-|z|)^2}\\,(2\\pi R)\\\\\\\\\n&=\\epsilon \\frac{R^2}{(R-|z|)^2}\n\\end{align}$$ As $R\\to \\infty$, we find that for any $\\epsilon>0$, there exists a number $n_0$, such that whenever $|z|>n_0$, $|f'(z)|<\\epsilon$.  We can conclude from this only that $$\\lim_{z\\to \\infty}f'(z)=0$$ Another approach is to write $f(z)$ in terms of its Taylor series.  Then, we see that $$\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{z\\to \\infty}\\frac{f(z)}{z}&=\\lim_{z\\to \\infty}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}z^{n-1}\\\\\\\\\n&=\\lim_{z\\to \\infty}\\left(\\frac{f(0)}{z}+f'(0)+\\frac12 f''(0)z+\\cdots \\right)\\\\\\\\\n&=0\n\\end{align}$$ only if all terms in the series are zero, except possibly $f(0)$.  Therefore, $f(z)$ must be a constant.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is \"If $f$ is entire and $\\lim_\\limits{z\\to\\infty} \\frac{f(z)}{z} = 0$ show that $f$ is constant.\" The question body includes the user's attempt and some additional thoughts about using theorems like Picard's, but the main problem is as stated in the title.\n\nThe task is to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Let's start by identifying the assumptions here.\n\n1. The function $f$ is entire. Entire means it's holomorphic everywhere on the complex plane.\n2. The limit of $f(z)/z$ as $z$ approaches infinity is 0. So $\\lim_{z\\to\\infty} \\frac{f(z)}{z} = 0$.\n\nThese are the two main conditions given in the problem. The problem then is to show that under these conditions, $f$ must be constant.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. In the original problem, there are two separate conditions: $f$ being entire and the limit condition. Each of these applies to the same object, $f$, but they are distinct properties. So each should be a separate assumption line.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n- $f$ is an entire function.\n- $\\lim_{z\\to\\infty} \\frac{f(z)}{z} = 0$.\n\nThen the problem statement is to show that $f$ is constant.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that $n$ is an integer and that $n$ is divisible by 7. However, the user's formatted problem only included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. The original problem's question was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 13*7. However, in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it as an assumption. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems contradictory. But looking again, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" then the assumption should be \"n is an integer,\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7,\" which was not in the original. Hmm, perhaps that example had a typo or was a different problem. But regardless, the user's example shows that each assumption is listed line by line, even if they apply to the same object.\n\nIn our current problem, the original problem states that f is entire and has the limit condition. So both are assumptions about f. Therefore, each should be a separate line. The problem is to show f is constant.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is an entire function,\n$\\lim_{z\\to\\infty} \\frac{f(z)}{z} = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $f$ is constant.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"show that f is constant,\" and the problem statement in the question is the same. The user's work is their attempt, but the actual problem to be structured is the one in the title and restated in the question.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement. The user's work is their own attempt, which we don't need to include in the formatted problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is entire,\n$\\lim_{z\\to\\infty} \\frac{f(z)}{z} = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $f$ is constant.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on its own line, addresses one property of one object. Here, both are about $f$. The first is that $f$ is entire, the second is the limit condition. That's two separate assumptions. The problem is to show $f$ is constant. That's straightforward. The user's example had two assumptions each on their own line, so this follows that.\n\nI think that's all. The user's original problem didn't have any hidden assumptions beyond those stated, so this should be correct.",
