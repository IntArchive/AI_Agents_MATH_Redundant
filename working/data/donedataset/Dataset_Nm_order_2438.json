    "Content": "$$\\cos (A + B)\\cos (A - B) = {\\cos ^2}A - {\\sin ^2}B$$ I have attempted this question by expanding the left side using the cosine sum and difference formulas and then multiplying, and then simplifying till I replicated the identity on the right. I am not stuck. What's bothering me is that the way I went about this question seemed like a rather \"clunky\" method. I'm just curious if I've missed some underlying pattern that could have made it easier to reproduce the identity on the right. The way I did it: $$\\begin{array}{l} \\cos (A + B)\\cos (A - B)\\\\ \\equiv (\\cos A\\cos B - \\sin A\\sin B)(\\cos A\\cos B + \\sin A\\sin B)\\\\ \\equiv {\\cos ^2}A{\\cos ^2}B - {\\sin ^2}A{\\sin ^2}B\\\\ \\equiv {\\cos ^2}A(1 - {\\sin ^2}B) - (1 - {\\cos ^2}A){\\sin ^2}B\\\\ \\equiv {\\cos ^2}A - {\\cos ^2}A{\\sin ^2}B - {\\sin ^2}B + {\\cos ^2}A{\\sin ^2}B\\\\ \\equiv {\\cos ^2}A - {\\sin ^2}B\\end{array}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about proving the trigonometric identity cos(A + B)cos(A - B) = cos²A - sin²B. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed, but in this case, the problem is a straightforward identity proof without any explicit conditions like \"n is an integer\" or divisibility. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there are any hidden assumptions. Trigonometric identities usually hold for all angles A and B unless specified otherwise. The problem doesn't mention any restrictions, so the main assumption is that A and B are real numbers (angles) where the cosine and sine functions are defined. However, since trigonometric identities are generally valid for all real numbers, maybe the assumption is implicit. But the user's example listed assumptions even if they seem obvious.\n\nLooking at the example given, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. That was specific. In this case, since there's no restriction, maybe the assumption is simply that A and B are real numbers. But the user wants each assumption to address only one property applied to one object. So maybe split into two lines: A is a real number, B is a real number. Alternatively, since they are angles, maybe angles in radians or degrees? But the identity is independent of the unit. So the key assumption is that A and B are real numbers where the functions are defined.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list A and B as real numbers. The problem statement is the identity to prove. Let me check the original question again. The user on Math Stack Exchange did the expansion using sum and difference formulas and simplified. The problem is to prove the identity, so the problem part is straightforward.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a real number,\nB is a real number.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\cos (A + B)\\cos (A - B) = {\\cos ^2}A - {\\sin ^2}B$$\n\nI think that's it. The example didn't include assumptions unless they were specific conditions, but here since it's a general identity, the assumptions are just that A and B are real numbers. Each assumption is listed separately for each variable.",
