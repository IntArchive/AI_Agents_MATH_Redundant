    "Content": "I read in [wikipedia][1] that: One can show that a functor $F : C → D$ yields an equivalence of categories if and only if $F$ is full, faithful and essentially surjective. I'm trying to prove this but I have an issue: Let $F:C\\to D$ and $G:D\\to C$ be functors and we have natural isomorphisms $\\epsilon: FG\\to 1_D$ and $\\eta: 1_C\\to GF$ . I need to show that $F$ is full, faithful and essentially surjective. Essentially surjective is easy: Take $P\\in D$ , then $P\\simeq F(G(P))$ because of $\\epsilon$ and we are done. Faithful is also not hard: Take $f,g: X\\to Y$ such that $F(f)=F(g)$ , then $GF(f)=GF(g)$ using the commutative diagrams (its hard to draw it here) of $\\eta$ and that it is a natural isomorphism we find $f=g$ . But proving $F$ is full is problematic. It all boils down to this map $$\nF(X)\\xrightarrow{F\\eta_Z}FGF(X)\\xrightarrow{\\epsilon_{F(Z)}}F(X)\n$$ if this map is identity (as is usually the case for counits and units) then we are done because by commutative diagram of $\\epsilon$ , for a morphism $\\alpha: F(X)\\to F(Y)$ we find $$\n\\alpha = \\epsilon_{F(Y)}\\: FG(\\alpha) \\: \\epsilon_{F(X)}^{-1}\n$$ and because $\\epsilon_{F(Z)}\\circ F\\eta_Z=\\mathrm{id}$ (and a similar relation in the other direction) we are done since $\\alpha$ becomes $F(f)$ for some $f$ . But in the definiton of equivalence of categories we do not demand any special relation between $\\epsilon$ and $\\eta$ just that they are natural isomorphisms. I'm not completely sure, but I don't think one can prove that $F(X)\\xrightarrow{F\\eta_Z}FGF(X)\\xrightarrow{\\epsilon_{F(Z)}}F(X)=\\mathrm{id}$ using what is available in the definition. To me there doesn't seem any reason why this is identity. So can this last formula be proven? Or is there another proof for fullness?\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_of_categories",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, your map is not an identity in general, but you can always get around that problem by replacing one of the isomorphisms of your equivalence in such a way that it becomes an adjoint equivalence (see here ). You don't need to do that, however. Take a morphism $g : FX → FY$. \nThere is only one choice for a morphism $f : X → Y$ such that $g = Ff$: by the naturality of $η$, $f$ must equal $η^{-1} ∘ Gg ∘ η$. So let $f$ be given by the previous formula, from which it follows that $GFf = Gg$. But $G$ is an equivalence, and you've already proven that equivalences are faithful, so $g = Ff$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking about proving that a functor F, which is part of an equivalence of categories, is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. The example given in the original question shows how to structure the problem by breaking down assumptions and presenting the problem clearly. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The main setup is that F is an equivalence of categories. According to the user's question, this means there exist functors F: C → D and G: D → C, along with natural isomorphisms ε: FG → 1_D and η: 1_C → GF. The user is specifically struggling with proving that F is full, even though they've managed to handle essentially surjective and faithful.\n\nLooking at the assumptions, each should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. F: C → D is a functor.\n2. G: D → C is a functor.\n3. ε: FG → 1_D is a natural isomorphism.\n4. η: 1_C → GF is a natural isomorphism.\n\nThese are the key components given in the definition of an equivalence of categories. The problem then is to show that F is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. However, the user's specific problem is about proving fullness, so the problem statement should reflect that focus, even though the original title mentions all three properties. But according to the example, the problem section should state exactly what needs to be proven. Since the user is asking about proving fullness (even though they mention the overall equivalence), maybe the problem here is specifically about proving that F is full given the equivalence, which includes the existence of G, η, and ε.\n\nBut the original problem's title says that F being an equivalence implies F is fully faithful and essentially surjective. The user's question is about proving that, but their specific issue is with the fullness part. So the formatted problem should state the entire problem (prove F is full, faithful, and essentially surjective), but perhaps the user's focus is on the full part. However, following the example, the problem section should present the problem as originally intended. The original question is to prove that an equivalence of categories implies the functor is fully faithful and essentially surjective. The user split the proof into parts and is stuck on the full part. But in terms of structuring, the problem should encapsulate the original task: proving that F is full, faithful, and essentially surjective given that it's part of an equivalence.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but in the formatted problem, they adjusted the assumptions to include that n is divisible by 7 (though in the original problem, it's for every integer n). Hmm, maybe the example has an error. Wait, no. The original problem in the example was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem in the example mistakenly added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original problem. But perhaps that's a mistake in the example. Wait, the user's example might have been a typo or an error. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. But perhaps the example was not properly constructed by the user, and we are supposed to follow the format they provided, even if their example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct in the sense that they filtered unrelated information and structured it, but perhaps in the original problem, there was a hidden assumption. But given that the user provided that example, we have to follow their structure even if it's flawed.\n\nHowever, in the current problem, the user's question is about proving that F is fully faithful and essentially surjective given that F is an equivalence (i.e., has a quasi-inverse G and natural isomorphisms). The assumptions here would include the existence of G, ε, and η as natural isomorphisms. The problem is to prove F is full, faithful, and essentially surjective.\n\nBut the user's specific problem is about the fullness part, but according to the instructions, we need to structure the original problem as per the given format, which includes all the problem's requirements. Therefore, the problem statement should be to prove that F is full, faithful, and essentially surjective given that it's part of an equivalence. The user's own problem within that is about the fullness, but the structured problem should present the entire original problem.\n\nSo, compiling the assumptions:\n\n- F: C → D is a functor.\n- G: D → C is a functor.\n- ε: FG → 1_D is a natural isomorphism.\n- η: 1_C → GF is a natural isomorphism.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that F is full, faithful, and essentially surjective.\n\nBut in the user's question, they already handled essentially surjective and faithful, but the problem is with fullness. However, per the user's example, even if the original problem had redundant conditions, the formatted problem lists all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So, in this case, the assumptions are the existence of the functors F and G, and the natural isomorphisms ε and η.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nF: C → D is a functor,\nG: D → C is a functor,\nε: FG → 1_D is a natural isomorphism,\nη: 1_C → GF is a natural isomorphism.\n\nProblem:\nProve that F is full, faithful, and essentially surjective.\n\nHowever, the user's specific issue is with proving fullness, but according to the instructions, we need to structure the problem as given, not the specific part the user is stuck on. The original question's title is about proving that F is fully faithful and essentially surjective given it's an equivalence, so the problem should encapsulate all three properties.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should list all the assumptions related to the equivalence (F, G, ε, η) and the problem to prove F is full, faithful, and essentially surjective.",
