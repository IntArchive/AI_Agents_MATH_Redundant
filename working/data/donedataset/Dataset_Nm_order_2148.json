    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are many \"elementary\" topological ways of proving this. Of course at some point you will have to use some properties of the complex plane. For example, it is not difficult to show that any set that separates the Riemann sphere must contain the boundary of a domain $U$ whose complement is connected; i.e. $U$ is simply-connected, and hence $\\partial U$ is connected. So any set (not necessarily closed, by the way) that disconnects the plane contains a plane continuum that disconnects the plane. Of course this still uses something (as mentioned in the question on MathOverflow, a key fact is that the union of two disjoint compact sets that do not disconnect the plane also does not disconnect the plane). Here is the most elementary proof that I can come up with on the spot. Again, we will need to use some properties of the plane, and we will also use elementary properties of Hausdorff convergence of continua. Lemma. Suppose that $A\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2\\setminus\\{0\\}$ disconnects $0$ from $\\infty$. Then $A$ contains a nontrivial plane continuum that separates $0$ from $\\infty$. Proof. First we note that, for some $\\varepsilon$, $A$ contains a closed set \n$$B\\subset \\{x\\in A: \\varepsilon < \\|x\\| < 1/\\varepsilon\\}$$\nthat separates $0$ from $\\infty$. Indeed, this follows from the definition of connectedness: There is an open, bounded set $U$ such that $\\partial U$ is contained in $A$, so we can set $B := \\partial U$. Now cover the plane by a grid of small squares of sidelength, say, $1/n$ ($n$ sufficiently large), and let $B_n$ be the union of (closed) squares that intersect $B$. Then $B_n$ separates $0$ from $\\infty$. Now it is an elementary (though perhaps tedious) exercise to show that $B_n$ has a connected component $\\tilde{B_n}$ that separates $0$ from $\\infty$. (This is essentially a discrete fact about a two-dimensional grid.) Let $C$ be a Hausdorff limit of the sequence $\\tilde{B_n}$. Since each $\\tilde{B_n}$ has diameter greater than $2\\varepsilon$, and this sequence is uniformly bounded, the limit is a nontrivial continuum. By construction, $C\\subset B$, and it is not difficult to see that $C$ must also separate $0$ from $\\infty$ (though we do not need this for the original question). Does this makes sense or am I missing something?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is: If E is a compact and totally disconnected subset of the complex plane, is there an elementary way to prove that the complement of E, which is ℂ \\ E, is connected?\n\nFirst, I need to recall some definitions. A totally disconnected set means that the connected components are single points. Compact in the complex plane (which is homeomorphic to ℝ²) implies that E is closed and bounded. So E is a closed, bounded set where every component is a point. The complement being connected... Hmm, in the plane, connectedness is equivalent to path-connectedness for open sets. Since ℂ \\ E is an open set (as E is closed), if it's connected, it should be path-connected.\n\nNow, I remember the Jordan Curve Theorem, but that's about simple closed curves. Maybe not directly applicable here. Another thought: in the plane, a compact totally disconnected set is something like a Cantor set. The complement of a Cantor set in the plane is connected, right? Because the Cantor set is \"small\" in some sense. But how to generalize that?\n\nWait, the problem is asking for an elementary proof. So maybe not using heavy theorems like the Jordan Curve Theorem. Let's think more basic. Suppose we take two points in the complement of E. We need to connect them with a path that doesn't go through E.\n\nSince E is totally disconnected, it doesn't contain any continuous arcs. So between any two points in the complement, there should be a way to \"go around\" E. But how to formalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that a compact totally disconnected set in the plane is zero-dimensional. Zero-dimensional implies it's nowhere dense, so its complement is dense. But density alone doesn't ensure connectedness. Wait, but maybe using the fact that E is totally disconnected and compact, and hence, for any two points not in E, you can find a polygonal path avoiding E.\n\nBut how? Let's think of E as being like a Cantor set. If E is compact and totally disconnected, then for any two points in the complement, you can take a line between them, and if that line intersects E, you can make a detour around the points of E. Since E is totally disconnected, the intersection of the line with E is a compact, totally disconnected subset of the line, which is a set of points with no intervals. So you can perturb the path around those points.\n\nBut how to make this precise? Let's say we have two points z and w in ℂ \\ E. The straight line from z to w is compact. If it doesn't intersect E, we're done. If it does intersect E, then since E is totally disconnected, the intersection can't contain any line segment. So the intersection is a closed, totally disconnected subset of the line. Then, each point in the intersection is isolated in the intersection (since it's compact and totally disconnected), so we can cover each intersection point with small disks that don't meet other parts of E, and then construct a polygonal path that goes around these disks.\n\nWait, but E is compact, so the intersection of the line with E is a compact, totally disconnected set. In the real line, compact and totally disconnected is a Cantor-like set. Such a set has no intervals, so it's nowhere dense. Therefore, the intersection is nowhere dense on the line, meaning that the complement on the line is dense. So between any two points on the line, you can find points in the complement, but how does that help in building a detour?\n\nAlternatively, think of the plane as ℝ². If E is compact and totally disconnected, then E is nowhere dense in ℝ². Because if it had an interior point, it would contain a disk, hence a continuum, contradicting totally disconnected. So E is nowhere dense, so the complement is dense. But being dense doesn't imply connected. However, in the plane, if a closed set is nowhere dense, its complement is connected? Not necessarily. For example, take a circle; its complement is two components. But a circle is not totally disconnected. Wait, but E is totally disconnected. So perhaps E being totally disconnected and compact implies that its complement is connected.\n\nAnother approach: use the fact that in the plane, the complement of a compact, totally disconnected set is path-connected. To show path-connectedness, take two points and construct a path between them avoiding E. Since E is compact and totally disconnected, you can cover E with small open sets, and use compactness to get a finite cover. Then, you can find a path that goes around these open sets. But I need to make this more precise.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that a compact, totally disconnected set in the plane has topological dimension zero. Then, by a theorem from dimension theory, the complement of a zero-dimensional compact set in the plane is connected. But is there an elementary way to show this without invoking dimension theory?\n\nMaybe using the concept of uniform disconnectedness. A totally disconnected compact set in the plane can be \"surrounded\" by small loops. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Suppose we have two points z and w not in E. Since E is compact, it's bounded, so it's contained in some large disk D. Then, both z and w are in the complement of E, which is open. The complement of E is the union of all the components of ℂ \\ E. If we can show that there's only one component, then it's connected.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that ℂ \\ E has more than one component. Then there exists a bounded component, because E is compact, so ℂ \\ E has exactly one unbounded component. But if there's a bounded component, then the boundary of that component would be part of E. But E is totally disconnected, so the boundary can't be a continuum. Wait, the boundary of a component of the complement must be a subset of E. If the component is bounded, its boundary is a continuum (connected) because in the plane, the boundary of a connected open set is connected. But E is totally disconnected, so it can't contain a continuum unless it's a single point. But the boundary of a component can't be a single point unless the component is a punctured disk or something. Wait, this might be a way to get a contradiction.\n\nSo, suppose that ℂ \\ E has a bounded component U. Then the boundary of U, denoted ∂U, is a subset of E. But ∂U is a closed set, and since U is a component, ∂U is non-empty and connected (in the plane, the boundary of a connected open set is connected). But E is totally disconnected, so the only connected subsets of E are single points. Therefore, ∂U must be a single point. However, in the plane, the boundary of a domain (connected open set) can't be a single point. Because if ∂U is just {p}, then U ∪ {p} would be open (since its complement is closed), but {p} is not open unless the space is discrete, which it isn't. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. Hence, there can be no bounded components of ℂ \\ E. Therefore, ℂ \\ E is connected.\n\nThis seems like a valid argument. It uses the fact that the boundary of a component is connected, which holds in the plane. Then, since E is totally disconnected, the boundary can't be connected unless it's a single point, but a single point can't be the boundary of an open set in the plane. Hence, no bounded components, so the complement is connected.\n\nBut is this considered elementary? It uses properties of plane topology, like the boundary of a connected open set being connected. Maybe that's part of the plane topology that's considered more advanced, but perhaps it's acceptable for an elementary proof.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that a totally disconnected compact set can be covered by a finite number of small disjoint closed disks, each containing a part of E, and then construct a path that goes around these disks. But to make that work, you need to know that E can be covered by such disks, which might rely on E being totally disconnected and compact. But I'm not sure how to formalize that.\n\nAnother angle: Use the fact that E, being compact and totally disconnected, is homeomorphic to a subset of the Cantor set. Then, since the Cantor set is totally disconnected and compact, its complement in the plane is connected. But I don't think that's directly helpful.\n\nWait, the key idea seems to be that if the complement had more than one component, there would be a bounded component, whose boundary is a connected subset of E. But E is totally disconnected, so that boundary must be a single point, which is impossible. Therefore, no such bounded component exists. Hence, the complement is connected.\n\nYes, this argument seems to work. It uses the structure of the plane and properties of connectedness. The critical step is the assertion that the boundary of a component is connected. In the plane, this is true, but it's a non-trivial result. For example, it's a consequence of the Janiszewski theorem or part of plane topology. However, maybe in the context of the question, this is considered \"elementary.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to avoid that. Suppose we take two points in the complement and try to connect them with a polygonal path. Since E is compact and nowhere dense (as totally disconnected implies nowhere dense in the plane), then between any two points, we can find a path that avoids E by making small detours around points of E that lie on the straight line. But to make this precise, we need to show that such detours exist. Since E is totally disconnected, it's nowhere dense, so around each point of E, we can find small disks not intersecting E except at that point. But since E is compact, we can cover it with finitely many such disks. Then, the line from z to w might intersect some of these disks, but we can adjust the path to go around them. Because there are finitely many, we can handle each intersection one by one.\n\nBut this approach requires that E is covered by finitely many disks, each containing a single point of E. But since E is totally disconnected and compact, it's actually a perfect set? No, not necessarily. For example, E could be a finite set of points, which is totally disconnected. But if E is like the Cantor set, it's uncountable. So covering it with finitely many disks each containing one point would not work. Hence, this approach might not be feasible for uncountable E.\n\nWait, but the idea is that when you take a line between two points, the intersection of E with that line is a compact, totally disconnected subset of the line. In the real line, a compact totally disconnected set is a closed set with no intervals, so it's nowhere dense. Therefore, the intersection is nowhere dense on the line. Hence, the line can be approximated by a path that deviates slightly from the line to avoid E. Since the intersection is nowhere dense, you can make detours around the points where E meets the line. But how to make this into a continuous path?\n\nAlternatively, think of the line as parameterized from 0 to 1. The set of points where the line intersects E is a closed nowhere dense subset of [0,1]. Therefore, its complement is a dense open set, which is a countable union of intervals. You can then construct a path that, whenever it encounters a gap in the intersection, takes a detour in the plane around that point. Since the gaps are dense, you can do this in a piecewise linear fashion. But this requires a transfinite induction or some kind of recursive process, which might not be elementary.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that E, being compact and totally disconnected, has the property that any two points in the complement can be connected by a path that's a finite polygonal chain avoiding E. To prove this, take the straight line between z and w. If it doesn't intersect E, done. If it does, take the first point of intersection (but since E is closed, the intersection is closed), but since E is totally disconnected, this first point is isolated along the line. So you can make a small detour around it. Repeat for the next intersection point. But because E is compact, the intersection with the line is compact and totally disconnected, hence it's a closed set with no intervals. Therefore, it's a countable set (since a closed set in the line is a countable union of points and intervals, but here there are no intervals, so it's just a countable set of points). Wait, no, Cantor set is uncountable. So if E is like a Cantor set in the line, then the intersection could be uncountable. But in the plane, a line intersects E in a compact, totally disconnected set, which in the line (the real line) is a closed set with no intervals. Such a set could be uncountable (like a Cantor set) or countable.\n\nBut even if it's uncountable, the intersection is a compact, nowhere dense subset of the line. To construct a path avoiding E, maybe use the fact that the complement of E in the line is dense, so you can find points on the line that are in the complement, and build a path that zigzags through these points. But in the plane, you can go around E by moving into the third dimension, but we're confined to the plane.\n\nAlternatively, use the concept of accessibility. Any point in E can be approached by paths from the complement. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, going back to the first idea, the key point is that if there's a bounded component of the complement, its boundary must be a connected subset of E. But since E is totally disconnected, that boundary must be a single point, which is impossible. Hence, there are no bounded components, so the complement is connected. This seems like the most straightforward argument, even if it uses some non-trivial plane topology.\n\nIs there a more elementary way? Maybe using the fact that E is totally disconnected, so it can't separate the plane. Because if a compact set separates the plane, it must contain a non-trivial continuum. But E doesn't, so it can't separate the plane. Hence, the complement is connected.\n\nYes! That's another way to phrase it. The argument is: In the plane, a compact set that separates the plane must contain a non-trivial continuum (a connected set with more than one point). But E is totally disconnected, so it contains no such continua. Therefore, E does not separate the plane. Hence, the complement of E is connected.\n\nThis uses the result from plane topology that a compact set separating the plane must contain a continuum. If that's considered elementary, then this is a good argument. But I'm not sure if that's a standard theorem or not. However, it's a well-known result in planar topology that a compact set that separates the plane must have a connected component that also separates the plane. Hence, if E is totally disconnected, none of its components (which are points) can separate the plane, so E itself cannot separate the plane. Therefore, the complement is connected.\n\nThis seems like a solid argument. It relies on understanding that separating the plane requires a connected set. Since E is totally disconnected, its components are points, which don't separate the plane. Hence, E cannot separate the plane, so the complement is connected.\n\nIn summary, the elementary way is to argue that since E is compact and totally disconnected, it cannot separate the plane into multiple components because that would require a connected subset of E, which doesn't exist. Therefore, ℂ \\ E is connected.",
