    "Content": "Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring (commutative with $1$) and $M$ a finitely generated $A$-module. I want to show that there exists a bound $n$ such that for every nilpotent endomorphism $T : M \\to M$ we have $T^n = 0$. There are two examples in mind: $M$ a module over a field $K$, that is $M = K^n$ a finite-dimensional vector space. In that case, $n$ is the required upper bound. $A=K[x]/(x^d)$ as a module over itself. In that case the dimension is $1$ (a basis is $\\{ 1 \\}$) but the upper bound is $d$ (consider the endomorphism $y \\mapsto x y$).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is the quicker proof I alluded to. I write in a separated answer because the first one is already fairly long and becomes hard to edit and has its own interest I think. We also need the remark in that answer on the fact that any nilpotent endomorphism remains nilpotent after ring extensions (base change). Let $T$ be a nilpotent endomorphism of $M$. Let $\\mathfrak p_1, \\dots, \\mathfrak p_r$ be the minimal prime ideals of $J:=\\mathrm{Ann}M$. They represent the generic points of $V(J)=\\mathrm{Supp}(M)$. So the localizations $M_{\\mathfrak p_i}=M\\otimes_A A_{\\mathfrak p_i}$ are Artinian and noetherian over $A_{\\mathfrak p_i}$ because $M=M/JM$, $M_{\\mathfrak p_i}=(M/JM)_{\\bar{\\mathfrak p}_i}$ where $\\bar{\\mathfrak p}_i$ is the image of $\\mathfrak p_i$ in $A/J$ and $(A/J)_{\\bar{\\mathfrak p}_i}$ is Artinian and noetherian. By YACP's anwer, $T_{\\mathfrak p_i}^n=0$ where $n$ is the maximum of the lengths $\\mathrm{length}(M_{\\mathfrak p_i})$. Consider the canonical map \n$$ M\\to \\prod_{1\\le i\\le r} M_{\\mathfrak p_i}$$ \nand its kernel $N$. If there exists $n'\\ge 1$ such that all nilpotent endomorphisms of $N$ vanish at power $n'$, then the same is true for $M$ and the power $n'+n$. As $N_{\\mathfrak p_i}=0$ for all $i$ by construction, the support of $N$ is strictly contained in that of $M$ (in fact $\\mathrm{Supp}(N)$ has positive codimension in $\\mathrm{Supp}(M)$). We then use noetherian induction on $\\mathrm{Supp}(M)$ (the initial case is when the support is empty, so $M=0$ and the property is trivially satisfied). Edit On the noetherian induction. Rather than use induction on the noetherian topological space $\\mathrm{Spec}(A)$, one can use the very definition of noetherian rings. Namely, consider the set of ideals $I$ such that there is a finitely generated $A$-module $M$ such that $I=\\mathrm{Ann}(M)$ and $M$ doesn't satisfy the bounded nilpotence index property. This set of ideals, if non-empty, admits a maximal (for the inclusion relation) element $I$. Let $M$ be a bad $A$-module corresponding to $I$. Then the $N$ in the above proof has $\\mathrm{Ann}(N)$ containing strictly $I$. So $N$ has the bounded nilpotence index property. We conclude as above that $M$ also has this property. Contradiction. So the set of bad ideals is empty.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Bound on nilpotency index of endomorphisms.\" The user wants to show that for a Noetherian ring A (commutative with 1) and a finitely generated A-module M, there exists a bound n such that every nilpotent endomorphism T of M satisfies T^n = 0. They provided two examples: one where M is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field K, and another with A=K[x]/(x^d) as a module over itself.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that A is a Noetherian ring, commutative with 1. Then M is a finitely generated A-module. The user wants a bound n such that for every nilpotent endomorphism T: M → M, T^n = 0.\n\nSo the assumptions should be each on separate lines, each addressing one property. Let's list them:\n\n1. A is a Noetherian ring.\n2. A is commutative.\n3. A has 1 (unity).\n4. M is a finitely generated A-module.\n5. T is a nilpotent endomorphism of M.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the existence of such a bound n is to be shown. The assumptions are the given conditions. So the problem's setup includes A being Noetherian, commutative with 1, M being finitely generated over A. The endomorphism T is any nilpotent one. The problem is to show there's a uniform bound n for all such T.\n\nIn the example given by the user, the assumptions included the object's properties. So here, the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is a Noetherian ring.\n- A is commutative.\n- A has an identity element (1).\n- M is a finitely generated A-module.\n\nThen the problem is to show there exists an integer n such that for every nilpotent endomorphism T of M, T^n = 0.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in this problem, the user is to show the existence of such an n given the conditions on A and M. So the assumptions are about A and M, and the problem is about the existence of the bound n for all nilpotent T.\n\nSo the problem's assumptions are the properties of A and M. Each of those properties should be listed line by line. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"Let A be a Noetherian ring (commutative with 1) and M a finitely generated A-module. I want to show that there exists a bound n such that for every nilpotent endomorphism T : M → M we have T^n = 0.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. A is a Noetherian ring.\n2. A is commutative.\n3. A has 1.\n4. M is a finitely generated A-module.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. Then the problem is to show there's a bound n such that every nilpotent endomorphism T of M satisfies T^n = 0.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these four assumptions, each on their own line, and then the problem statement.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one property applied to one object. Let's check each line:\n\n- \"A is a Noetherian ring\" → one property (Noetherian) of the ring A.\n- \"A is commutative\" → another property of A.\n- \"A has 1\" → another property (unital) of A.\n- \"M is a finitely generated A-module\" → property of M.\n\nYes, each line addresses a single property of a single object.\n\nThe problem is to show that there exists a bound n such that for every nilpotent endomorphism T of M, T^n = 0.\n\nSo putting this all together, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a Noetherian ring,\nA is commutative,\nA has 1,\nM is a finitely generated A-module.\nProblem:\nShow that there exists a bound $n$ such that for every nilpotent endomorphism $T : M \\to M$, we have $T^n = 0$.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me compare with the example given. In the example, they had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the assumptions are the properties of A and M, and the problem is to find the bound n. The user wants to structure the problem by listing all the given assumptions first and then the problem statement. So this should be correct.",
