    "Content": "I was told this question by a friend, who said that their friend had thought about it on and off for six months without any luck.  I have then had it for a while without any luck either.  It is in the style of a contest question, but it is unlike any other, as really nothing seems to gain any ground. Here's the question: Let $f:[0,1]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function satisfying the following property:  If $ABC$ is the equilateral triangle with side lengths 1, we have for any point $P$ inside $ABC$, $f(\\overline{AP})+f(\\overline{BP})+f(\\overline{CP})=0$ where $\\overline{AP}$ is the distance from point P to vertex $A$.  (Example: by taking $P=A$ we see $f(0)=-2f(1)$.) Prove or disprove: $f$ must be identically zero on its domain Notice that continuity is critical since otherwise I could just take the function $f(x)=0$ whenever $x\\in (0,1)$ and $f(0)=1$, $f(1)=\\frac{-1}{2}$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Chandru has provided the link to a complete solution, but as Eric notes, it is somewhat involved. Some months ago, being unaware of that solution, I had found a less involved proof if you assume that $f$ is not only continuous but also differentiable. I reproduce that proof below. Let $\\triangle$ be the set of points inside or on the triangle, and $a, b, c : \\triangle \\to [0,1]$ be scalar fields on $\\triangle$ mapping any point $P$ to the distances $\\overline{AP}$, $\\overline{BP}$, $\\overline{CP}$ respectively. Define the scalar field $$g := f \\circ a + f \\circ b + f \\circ c = 0.$$ It is easily shown that $\\nabla a$ is a unit vector pointing away from $A$, and similarly for $b$ and $c$. Then $$\\nabla g = f'(a) \\nabla a + f'(b) \\nabla b + f'(c) \\nabla c,$$ where $f'(x) = df/dx$. But $g$ is constant, so $\\nabla g = 0$. Take $P$ to be a point on the side $AB$. Then $\\nabla a$ and $\\nabla b$ are antiparallel, while $\\nabla c$ is linearly independent. For their linear combination to be $0$, the coefficient of $\\nabla c$, which is $f'(c)$, must be $0$. Since $P$ is an arbitrary point on $AB$, $c$ is any value between $\\sqrt{3}/2$ and $1$, so over that range $f'$ is zero, and $f$ is constant. Once we've shown that $f'$ is zero between $\\sqrt{3}/2$ and $1$, for any other value $a$ it's fairly easy to pick a point inside the triangle that's $a$ units from $A$ and over $\\sqrt{3}/2$ units from $C$. Now $\\nabla g = f'(a) \\nabla a + f'(b) \\nabla b + f'(c) \\nabla c = 0$. The last term drops out because $f'(c) = 0$. $\\nabla a$ and $\\nabla b$ are linearly independent in the interior of the triangle, so their coefficients $f'(a)$ and $f'(b)$ must be zero. Thus $f' = 0$ everywhere, so $f$ is constant. In particular, $f(1/\\sqrt{3}) = 0$, so $f = 0$ everywhere.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about a function f defined on [0,1] that's continuous. The key condition is that for any point P inside an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 1, the sum of f evaluated at the distances from P to each vertex A, B, and C is zero. The example given shows that when P is A, then f(0) + 2f(1) = 0, so f(0) = -2f(1). The task is to prove or disprove that f must be zero everywhere.\n\nFirst, list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The domain of f is [0,1].\n2. f is continuous.\n3. For the equilateral triangle ABC with side length 1, for any point P inside ABC, the sum f(AP) + f(BP) + f(CP) = 0. Here, AP, BP, CP are distances from P to each vertex.\n4. The triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 1.\n\nWait, the problem states \"Let f: [0,1]→ℝ be a continuous function satisfying the following property: If ABC is the equilateral triangle with side lengths 1, we have for any point P inside ABC, f(AP)+f(BP)+f(CP)=0 where AP is the distance from point P to vertex A.\"\n\nSo breaking down:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is defined on the interval [0,1] (domain).\n- f is continuous.\n- ABC is an equilateral triangle with side length 1.\n- For any point P inside triangle ABC, the sum f(AP) + f(BP) + f(CP) = 0.\n\nThe problem is to prove or disprove that f must be identically zero on [0,1].\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from [0,1] to ℝ,\nf is continuous,\nABC is an equilateral triangle with side length 1,\nfor any point P inside ABC, f(AP) + f(BP) + f(CP) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that f is identically zero on [0,1].\n\nBut wait, the example given in the original problem shows that f(0) = -2f(1). But that's derived from the assumption when taking P=A. So maybe that's part of the problem's given conditions, but in the problem statement, the user included that as an example. So in the formatted problem, do we include that as an assumption? The original problem says \"satisfying the following property: If ABC...\", so the only assumptions are the domain, continuity, and the condition on the triangle. The example is just illustrative, not an assumption. So the example's conclusion (f(0) = -2f(1)) is a consequence of the given property when taking P=A, but it's not an assumption. So the assumptions are as above.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined as a function from [0,1] to ℝ,\nf is continuous,\nABC is an equilateral triangle with side length 1,\nfor any point P inside ABC, the equation f(AP) + f(BP) + f(CP) = 0 holds.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that f must be identically zero on [0,1].\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, they structured the assumption as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So each assumption is a separate condition. In this case, the problem's original assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function with domain [0,1] and codomain ℝ.\n2. f is continuous.\n3. ABC is an equilateral triangle with side length 1.\n4. For any point P inside ABC, f(AP) + f(BP) + f(CP) = 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The third one is about the triangle, the fourth is about the condition on f.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list each of these as separate assumptions. The problem is to prove or disprove f is zero everywhere.",
