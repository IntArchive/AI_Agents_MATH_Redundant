    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that a certain function u, defined via an integral involving solutions of homogeneous wave equations, satisfies the nonhomogeneous wave equation. The user provided an example where assumptions and the problem were separated, with each assumption being a single condition on one object.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were listed as individual points. For instance, in the example problem, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption was a separate line addressing one condition on one object.\n\nNow, applying this to the current problem. The problem is from PDE Evans, 2nd edition, page 80, regarding the nonhomogeneous wave equation. The user has already gone through some steps where they computed u_t and u_tt using differentiation under the integral sign and then used the fact that u_tt(·;s) = Δu(·;s). They concluded that u_tt - Δu = f, and also noted the initial conditions u(x,0) = u_t(x,0) = 0.\n\nThe task here is to structure this problem into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the format. The original question is to prove that u_tt - Δu = f in ℝⁿ × (0,∞). But in the process, the user has already done the computation. However, the structure requires me to list all assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem defines u as the integral from 0 to t of u(x,t;s) ds, where u(x,t;s) is the solution to a homogeneous wave equation with specific initial conditions. So the assumptions would relate to the properties of u(x,t;s), the definition of u via the integral, and the initial conditions given.\n\nLooking at the problem setup:\n\n1. The nonhomogeneous wave equation is given with u=0 and u_t=0 at t=0.\n2. u(x,t;s) is defined as the solution to a homogeneous wave equation starting at time s, with u(·;s)=0 and u_t(·;s)=f(·;s) at t=s.\n3. The function u is constructed by integrating u(x,t;s) from 0 to t.\n\nSo the assumptions would include each of these conditions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- For the homogeneous problem solved by u(x,t;s):\n  - The PDE is u_tt(·;s) - Δu(·;s) = 0 in ℝⁿ × (s, ∞).\n  - Initial conditions: u(·;s) = 0 and u_t(·;s) = f(·;s) on ℝⁿ × {t=s}.\n\n- For the definition of u(x,t):\n  - u is defined as the integral from 0 to t of u(x,t;s) ds.\n\n- For the nonhomogeneous problem:\n  - The initial conditions u=0 and u_t=0 on ℝⁿ × {t=0}.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that this u satisfies the nonhomogeneous equation. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which u is defined. So each part that is given as part of the problem setup should be an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. u(x,t;s) satisfies the homogeneous wave equation u_tt(·;s) - Δu(·;s) = 0 in ℝⁿ × (s, ∞).\n2. u(x,t;s) has initial conditions u(·;s) = 0 and u_t(·;s) = f(·;s) on ℝⁿ × {t=s}.\n3. u(x,t) is defined as the integral from 0 to t of u(x,t;s) ds.\n4. The initial conditions for the nonhomogeneous problem are u=0 and u_t=0 on ℝⁿ × {t=0}.\n\nBut the problem statement to prove is that this u satisfies u_tt - Δu = f in ℝⁿ × (0, ∞), given these assumptions.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"I am asked to prove that u_{tt} - Δ u = f in ℝⁿ × (0,∞)\". So the problem is to prove that equation given the setup.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem setup, each as separate points.\n\nNow, in the example, each assumption was a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The function u(x,t;s) satisfies the PDE u_{tt}(·;s) - Δu(·;s) = 0 in ℝⁿ × (s, ∞).\n- The function u(x,t;s) satisfies the initial conditions u(·;s) = 0 and u_t(·;s) = f(·;s) on ℝⁿ × {t=s}.\n- The function u(x,t) is defined as the integral from 0 to t of u(x,t;s) ds.\n- The initial conditions for the nonhomogeneous problem are u=0 and u_t=0 on ℝⁿ × {t=0}.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement includes that the user has already computed u_t and u_tt, and showed that u_tt - Δu = f. But the formatting task is just to structure the problem as per the example, filtering unrelated info. The original question is to prove u_tt - Δu = f, and the user provided their attempt. However, the task here is to present the problem in the specified format, not the solution.\n\nTherefore, the problem part is \"Prove that u_{tt} - Δu = f in ℝⁿ × (0, ∞)\", and the assumptions are all the given conditions that lead to this problem.\n\nSo each assumption should be a single line, one condition. So let's list them:\n\nAssumption:\nu(x,t;s) is a solution of the homogeneous wave equation u_{tt}(·;s) - Δu(·;s) = 0 in ℝⁿ × (s, ∞),\nu(x,t;s) satisfies the initial condition u(·;s) = 0 on ℝⁿ × {t=s},\nu(x,t;s) satisfies the initial condition u_t(·;s) = f(·;s) on ℝⁿ × {t=s},\nu(x,t) is defined as ∫₀ᵗ u(x,t;s) ds for x ∈ ℝⁿ and t ≥ 0,\nThe nonhomogeneous problem requires u=0 on ℝⁿ × {t=0},\nThe nonhomogeneous problem requires u_t=0 on ℝⁿ × {t=0}.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption was concise. For instance, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each line is one condition on one object.\n\nIn this case, the initial conditions for u(x,t;s) are two separate conditions: u=0 at t=s and u_t = f at t=s. So each should be a separate assumption.\n\nSimilarly, the definition of u as the integral is another assumption.\n\nThe initial conditions for the nonhomogeneous problem (u=0 and u_t=0 at t=0) are also separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions list would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each s ≥ 0, u(·;s) satisfies the PDE u_{tt}(·;s) - Δu(·;s) = 0 in ℝⁿ × (s, ∞),\nFor each s ≥ 0, u(·;s) = 0 on ℝⁿ × {t=s},\nFor each s ≥ 0, u_t(·;s) = f(·;s) on ℝⁿ × {t=s},\nu(x,t) is defined as ∫₀ᵗ u(x,t;s) ds for x ∈ ℝⁿ, t ≥ 0,\nThe solution u satisfies u=0 on ℝⁿ × {t=0},\nThe solution u satisfies u_t=0 on ℝⁿ × {t=0}.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that this u satisfies the nonhomogeneous equation. However, in the original problem statement, the user is asked to prove u_tt - Δu = f. The initial conditions u=0 and u_t=0 are part of the problem's given conditions, so they should be in the assumptions. However, in the example, the initial problem had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, the problem is to prove the PDE holds, given the construction via Duhamel's principle.\n\nThus, the assumptions are the properties of u(x,t;s), the definition of u via the integral, and the initial conditions for the nonhomogeneous problem. The problem is to show that this u satisfies u_tt - Δu = f.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each of these as separate assumptions and then state the problem as proving the PDE.",
