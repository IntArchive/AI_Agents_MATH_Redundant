    "Content": "I want to know how to prove the following inequality. For $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots $ $$ n < \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)^n $$ I tried with math induction but I failed.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We have that $$n < \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)^n\\iff \\ln n< n\\ln \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\\iff \\frac{\\ln n}{n}<\\ln \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right).$$ Now, we use the inequalities (see $(3)$ in http://ajmaa.org/RGMIA/papers/v7n2/pade.pdf ) $$\\begin{equation}\\frac{2x}{2+x}\\le \\ln (1+x)\\le \\frac{x}{2}\\frac{2+x}{1+x}, \\quad x>0.\\tag{1}\\end{equation}$$ In our case, we get from $(1),$\n$$\\ln \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\\ge \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}+2}.$$ Thus we only have to show $$\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}+2}>\\frac{\\ln n}{n}.$$ That is, $$\\ln n<\\frac{2n}{\\sqrt{n}+2}.$$ Since $\\ln n=2\\ln \\sqrt{n}$ previous inequality is equivalent to $$\\ln \\sqrt{n}<\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{n}+2}.$$ Now, using again $(1)$ $$\\ln \\sqrt{n}=\\ln (1+\\sqrt{n}-1)\\le \\frac{\\sqrt{n}-1}{2}\\frac{\\sqrt{n}+1}{\\sqrt{n}}=\\frac{n-1}{2\\sqrt{n}}.$$ Thus we have to show $$\\frac{n-1}{2\\sqrt{n}}<\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{n}+2}.$$ But $$\\frac{n-1}{2\\sqrt{n}}<\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{n}+2}\\iff 2(n-1)<(n+1)\\sqrt{n},$$ which holds for any $n\\in\\mathbb{N}.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided involved breaking down assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original problem from Math Stack Exchange is about proving the inequality n < (1 + 1/√n)^n for n = 1, 2, 3, and so on. The user tried induction but failed. \n\nNow, I need to parse this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object. The problem here is to prove the inequality for all positive integers n starting from 1. \n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem states n is a positive integer (1,2,3,...). So the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove that n is less than (1 + 1/sqrt(n))^n. \n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n was divisible by 7, but the formatted problem listed that as an assumption. However, in this current problem, the user hasn't mentioned any additional assumptions like n being divisible by something. The problem is general for all n starting at 1. So the only assumption here is that n is a positive integer. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have that assumption. The problem statement is to prove the given inequality. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The original problem mentions using induction but failing. The problem itself doesn't specify any constraints beyond n being a positive integer. So I think the only assumption is n is a positive integer. \n\nSo the Assumption section will have one line: n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). The Problem section restates the inequality to prove. \n\nI need to check the example again. In the example, the assumption listed two points: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. Wait, that example might be from a different problem where the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7. Wait, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe a mistake. Wait, maybe the original problem had some hidden condition, or perhaps the answer required n to be divisible by 7. Hmm, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the example was incorrect. However, the user provided that example as their own structure, so perhaps they intended to split the conditions into separate lines even if they are part of the problem statement. \n\nIn the current problem, the original question states the inequality holds for n = 1, 2, 3, ..., so the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. There's no mention of other conditions. So the assumptions should list that n is a positive integer. \n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$ n < \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)^n $$.\n\nI think that's all. The user tried induction but failed, but that's part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem itself doesn't have any hidden assumptions beyond n being a positive integer. So I don't need to include anything else in the assumptions.",
