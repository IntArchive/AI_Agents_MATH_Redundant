    "Content": "If $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, how do I prove that normalizer of the normalizer $P$ is same as the normalizer of $P$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We have the following: $P\\leq N(P)\\leq N(N(P))$. We see that $P$ is also a Sylow $p$-group of $N(P)$ and of $N(N(P))$. If $x\\in N(N(P))$, then $xPx^{-1}\\leq xN(P)x^{-1}=N(P)$, and since all Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugate, we have that there exists $y\\in N(P)$ such that $xPx^{-1}=yPy^{-1}$. But since $y\\in N(P)$, we have that $yPy^{-1}=P$, and so $xPx^{-1}=P$. This shows that $x\\in N(P)$, and they must be the same.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they provided shows breaking down assumptions and stating the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, the original question is about proving that the normalizer of the normalizer of a Sylow p-subgroup is the same as the normalizer of the subgroup itself. So, I need to extract the assumptions here.\n\nThe key elements here are: P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G. The problem is to show that the normalizer of the normalizer of P equals the normalizer of P. So, the assumptions should list each condition. Since the problem is about group theory, the main assumptions are that P is a Sylow p-subgroup, and that we're working within the group G. The problem is to prove the equality of those two normalizers.\n\nWait, in the example given, the assumption included both that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But here, the problem doesn't mention any additional conditions on P beyond being a Sylow p-subgroup. So maybe the only assumption here is that P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G. But perhaps there's an implicit assumption that G is a finite group since Sylow theorems apply to finite groups. However, the original question doesn't specify that. But in standard Sylow theorems, yes, G has to be finite. So maybe that's an assumption. But the user's example didn't include implicit assumptions, only the ones stated. The original question just says \"P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G\". So maybe the assumptions are only two: G is a group, P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G. But the problem is about normalizers. However, in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n\nBut wait, does the problem require G to be finite? Since Sylow subgroups are defined for finite groups. So that's a necessary condition. So perhaps that's an assumption. But the original question didn't state that. The user might need to include that as an assumption. So to list each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption: G is a finite group.\n\nAssumption: P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n\nProblem: Prove that the normalizer of the normalizer of P in G is equal to the normalizer of P in G.\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated in the original question is: \"If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, how do I prove that normalizer of the normalizer of P is same as the normalizer of P?\" So maybe the only assumption is that P is a Sylow p-subgroup. But implicitly, G must be finite. But since the user's example included explicit assumptions even if they might be part of the problem statement, perhaps here we need to make explicit that G is a finite group. So, to structure:\n\nAssumption: G is a finite group.\n\nAssumption: P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n\nProblem: Prove that the normalizer of the normalizer of P in G is equal to the normalizer of P in G.\n\nBut I should check if there are any other conditions. The problem doesn't mention anything else, so probably these are the two assumptions. Each line addresses one property applied to one object: first line about G being finite, second about P being Sylow. That seems to fit the format.",
