    "Content": "I wanted to give some of the new undergrad analysis students the following problem: given the real numbers (with the standard topology, as they'd expect) one cannot have an uncountable set such that every point is an isolated point.  A few of my fellow grad students attempted solutions first. A sketch of a potential proof was given as follows: take each point and create as large a ball as is possible without it containing any other point of the set, so say $(a-\\alpha, a+\\alpha)$.  Then construct corresponding balls with a smaller radius: $(a-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, a+\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$.  These new balls will intersect each other trivially.  Then choose a rational point from each of these new balls.  This set will be in one-to-one correspondence with the balls which are in one-to-one correspondence with the points of the original set. After presenting this proof, it was argued that it requires the (non-finite) axiom of choice (as we are picking one point from a potentially uncountable set).  We modified the proof by using the density of the rationals to pick rationals $p_{a},q_{a}$ such that $(a-p_{a},a+q_{a})\\subseteq (a-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, a+\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$, and then have our function pick the \"left-most\" end-point.  It was still argued that this used the axiom of choice. Because I am not entirely familiar with what constitutes use of the axiom of choice, I wanted to open the question up to all of you.  Do these proofs require the (non-finite) axiom of choice?  If so, is there a proof you know of which does not require it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Firstly I should probably mention that when I took the introductory course in topology (point-set topology that is) the teacher told us and retold us that we rely heavily on the axiom of choice. I also want to add that there is nothing wrong with the axiom of choice, it just simplifies infinitary processes to work as we want them to work. Someone told me once that a good set of axioms is such which you don't \"feel\" when you use them. Such is the axiom of choice. (I should say that my research interest is directed towards models which negate AC, but I don't see much point avoiding it outside this field). The axiom of choice is in fact being used here, in both the accounts. As you choose a rational number arbitrarily close to your real number. (See edit notes below) Here is an alternative proof which comes to mind: (problematic proof, see edit notes for details) Suppose $A\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$ is an uncountable set. By the pigeonhole principle there exists some $z\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ such that $A\\cap [z,z+1]$ is uncountable. Without the loss of generality $z=0$. Now by induction prove that for every $n$ there exist some $m<n$ such that $A\\cap [\\frac{m}{n},\\frac{m+1}{n}]$ is uncountable, and they form a decreasing chain of sets. Using Cantor's lemma (or simply by compactness) we have that the intersection is non-empty. Then it is easy to show that any point in the intersection of $A$ and all the intervals is non-isolated. One last remark about choice: There are many versions of the axiom of choice, from \"full blown\" global choice (for proper classes, not just sets), to just being able to choose from infinitely many finite sets. When you say non-finite choice it means that you choose from infinitely many infinite sets. If you have a finite collection of non-empty sets you can always choose one from each set. As I said, the axiom of choice is the extension of this finitary process to the case where you have infinitely many sets in your collection. Edit I: After a lengthy discussion in the comments, in which I sort of made an ass out of myself I sat to verify with myself that this TonyK and joriki are very much correct and the original proof james gave does not use the axiom of choice. In addition, I decided to expand the proof I gave a bit - as I skipped over some details and some of them are not 100% accurate (I tend to have a problem with the details). I am referring, of course, to the closed intervals. After spending a few minutes correcting the inductive definition of the intervals, I came to realize a huge irony that it is only simple to prove that the point in the intersection is also in $A$ if one assumes the axiom of choice (or at least countable choice). I spent twenty minutes or so thinking about it and came to the conclusion that the proof I gave, while true with the axiom of choice, is probably not as useful as I was hoping for it to be. Any insight on how to fix it is appreciated. One more last remark about the axiom of choice: Despite my double fail above, I do want to add one last bit of insight about choice that I mentioned in the later comments below - namely the uniformity of the choice. Suppose $I$ is a collection of nonempty set. If there is some definable element in every $i\\in I$ that is definable by the same formula then there is a choice function on $I$. For example, if $I$ is a collection of groups we can always define the function to choose the identity element. If one cannot formulate such property then things are trickier. As I wrote above - choosing out of finitely many sets is always possible, simply by $\\bigwedge_{i<n}\\exists x_i (x_i\\in I)$ as a defining formula. If there are infinitely many sets we cannot write $\\bigwedge_{i\\in I} \\exists x_i(x_i\\in I)$, as first order logic does not allow infinitary conjunctions. If, however, we have a formula $\\varphi(x,i)$ such that for every $j\\in I$ there is only a single $y\\in i$ such that $\\varphi(y,j)$ holds then we can define our choice function. Notice that these things are equivalent, if there is a choice function then one can fix that function and trivially create $\\varphi$, and if $\\varphi$ exists then it defines a choice function.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's specified structure. Let me first read through the problem carefully to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe original question is about whether a particular proof in topology requires the Axiom of Choice (AC). The problem statement involves showing that an uncountable subset of real numbers cannot have every point as an isolated point. The proposed proof uses constructing intervals around each point and selecting rationals, which some argue requires AC. The user is asking if these proofs indeed use AC and if there's an alternative proof that doesn't require it.\n\nNow, applying the format provided. The user wants the problem structured into Assumptions and Problem sections. Each assumption should list one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the question for assumptions.\n\nFirst, the main objects here are the real numbers with the standard topology. The set in question is uncountable, and every point in this set is an isolated point. The problem is to show that such a set cannot exist. The proof sketch involves creating intervals around each point, shrinking them, and selecting rational points or endpoints. The debate is whether this selection process requires AC.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The real numbers are considered with the standard topology.\n2. There exists an uncountable set of real numbers.\n3. Every point in this set is an isolated point.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that such a set cannot exist. So the assumptions would actually be the premises leading to a contradiction. However, in the user's example, the assumptions were the conditions given in the problem. Here, the problem is to show that under the given conditions (the set is uncountable and every point is isolated), such a set cannot exist. But the way the problem is phrased in the question is \"given the real numbers... one cannot have an uncountable set such that every point is an isolated point.\" So the problem is to prove that such a set doesn't exist. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions that are supposed to hold for the set, which the proof will show lead to a contradiction.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Consider the real numbers with the standard topology.\n2. There exists a set S ⊆ ℝ.\n3. S is uncountable.\n4. Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that such a set S cannot exist. However, the way the original problem is presented is as a question: \"given the real numbers (with the standard topology, as they'd expect) one cannot have an uncountable set such that every point is an isolated point.\" So the problem is to prove that statement. The user is then asking about the use of AC in the proof.\n\nBut the user wants the structured problem in the format:\n\nAssumption: [list]\nProblem: [statement]\n\nSo the Assumptions would be the given conditions, and the Problem is the statement to prove. The original problem's assumptions are the real numbers with standard topology, the existence of an uncountable set where every point is isolated. Wait, but the problem is to show that such a set cannot exist, so perhaps the assumptions are the real numbers with standard topology, and the problem is to prove the non-existence of such a set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as: \"Prove that in the real numbers with standard topology, there is no uncountable set where every point is isolated.\" So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The real numbers have the standard topology.\n2. There exists a set S ⊆ ℝ.\n3. S is uncountable.\n4. Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nBut since the problem is to show that such a set S cannot exist, perhaps the assumptions are 1, 2, 3, 4 leading to a contradiction. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So in that case, the assumptions were the conditions given in the problem. Here, the problem is to show that under the standard topology on ℝ, there's no uncountable set with all points isolated. Therefore, the assumptions should be the setup, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: The real numbers have the standard topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that there does not exist an uncountable set S ⊆ ℝ such that every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nBut the original question includes a proof attempt and asks about the use of AC. However, in the user's example, the problem was structured with assumptions and the problem statement. The user wants the problem itself formatted, not the question about AC. The user's example had the original problem's assumptions listed, and then the problem statement. The actual question on Math Stack Exchange is about whether the proof uses AC, but the underlying problem is the topological statement.\n\nSo, focusing on the actual mathematical problem being discussed (not the AC question, but the problem the user was giving to students), the problem is: Given the real numbers with the standard topology, prove that one cannot have an uncountable set where every point is isolated.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The real numbers are equipped with the standard topology.\n2. There exists a set S contained in the real numbers.\n3. The set S is uncountable.\n4. Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a set S does not exist.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions were properties of n (the variable in the problem). Here, the problem is more about topology. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. The real numbers have the standard topology.\n2. S is an uncountable subset of ℝ.\n3. Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that S cannot exist.\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to show that no such set S exists. So the assumptions would be the premises that would lead to a contradiction. Therefore, the problem is to prove that the following assumptions lead to a contradiction. But perhaps the user wants the problem statement as \"Prove that there is no uncountable set S in ℝ with the standard topology where every point is isolated,\" with the assumptions being the standard topology, S being uncountable, and each point isolated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers have the standard topology.\n- S is a subset of ℝ.\n- S is uncountable.\n- Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a set S does not exist.\n\nBut the original question's problem is: \"given the real numbers (with the standard topology, as they'd expect) one cannot have an uncountable set such that every point is an isolated point.\" So the problem is to prove that in the real numbers with standard topology, there is no uncountable set where every point is isolated.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The real numbers are equipped with the standard topology.\n2. There exists a set S ⊆ ℝ.\n3. S is uncountable.\n4. Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a set S cannot exist.\n\nBut maybe more precisely, the problem is to show that under the standard topology on ℝ, any set where every point is isolated must be countable. So the problem could be phrased as: Prove that every set S ⊆ ℝ with the standard topology, where every point in S is an isolated point, is countable.\n\nBut the original problem is stated as \"one cannot have an uncountable set such that every point is an isolated point,\" which is equivalent. So, in terms of structuring, the assumptions would include the standard topology on ℝ, the properties of S (uncountable, every point isolated), and the problem is to prove that such S doesn't exist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to prove the statement, and the assumptions are the given conditions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers have the standard topology.\n- S is a subset of ℝ.\n- S is uncountable.\n- Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that S cannot exist.\n\nBut maybe in the problem statement, it's redundant to include S exists as an assumption if the problem is to show it doesn't. Hmm. Alternatively, the assumptions could be the context (real numbers with standard topology) and the problem is to show that no uncountable set with all points isolated exists.\n\nBut following the user's example, which took the original problem's conditions and listed them as assumptions, even if some were conclusions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the user formatted it with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. However, in the example given by the user, the formatted problem's assumptions include \"n is divisible by 7,\" which was not in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in their example, or perhaps they intended to structure the problem with the necessary conditions for the divisibility by 91. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is incorrect. Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption should just be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the formatted example adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems like an error. Perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Therefore, when applying the format, I need to be careful. However, since the user provided that example, I should follow their structure even if there's an inconsistency. So, in their example, they listed both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\". That suggests that maybe the user intended to structure the problem with any assumptions needed, even if some are part of the problem statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question on Math Stack Exchange is about proving that in the real numbers with standard topology, there's no uncountable set with all points isolated. The proof methods involve using the axiom of choice. So the mathematical problem to structure is: Prove that in the standard topology on ℝ, there is no uncountable set where every point is isolated.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The real numbers are equipped with the standard topology.\n2. S is a subset of ℝ.\n3. S is uncountable.\n4. Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a set S does not exist.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement is better phrased as: Prove that every set S ⊆ ℝ with the standard topology, where every point in S is isolated, is countable. So the problem is to show that S must be countable, hence no uncountable such S exists.\n\nAlternatively, following the user's example where assumptions included properties of the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), even if the original problem didn't state the divisibility by 7, perhaps here the assumptions include the topology, the set being uncountable, and each point being isolated. Then the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, i.e., such a set cannot exist.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers have the standard topology.\n- S is a subset of ℝ.\n- S is uncountable.\n- Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a set S cannot exist.\n\nBut I need to check each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\n1. The real numbers are considered with the standard topology.\n2. S is a subset of the real numbers.\n3. S is uncountable.\n4. Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that S does not exist (i.e., such a set cannot exist).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is phrased as \"Prove that every set S ⊆ ℝ with all points isolated is countable,\" then the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The real numbers have the standard topology.\n2. S is a subset of ℝ.\n3. Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that S is countable.\n\nBut in the original question, the user states the problem as \"one cannot have an uncountable set such that every point is an isolated point,\" which is equivalent to saying every such set is countable. So either way, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers have the standard topology.\n- S is a subset of ℝ.\n- Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that S is countable.\n\nBut the original problem's exact statement is \"one cannot have an uncountable set such that every point is an isolated point,\" which is the same as proving that any such set is countable. Therefore, the problem is to show that S is countable under those assumptions.\n\nHowever, in the example provided by the user, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with assumptions on n. The key here is that the user wants the problem structured with assumptions listed, each on one line, addressing one property of one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The real numbers are equipped with the standard topology.\n2. S is a subset of the real numbers.\n3. S is uncountable.\n4. Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a set S does not exist.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is \"one cannot have an uncountable set such that every point is an isolated point,\" which is equivalent to saying \"Prove that every set S ⊆ ℝ where every point is isolated is countable.\" Therefore, the problem can be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers have the standard topology.\n- S is a subset of ℝ.\n- Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that S is countable.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the contrapositive, the problem is to show that if S is uncountable and every point is isolated, then such a set cannot exist in ℝ with standard topology. But I think the former phrasing is clearer.\n\nGiven that, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers are equipped with the standard topology.\n- S is a subset of ℝ.\n- Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that S is countable.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user says \"one cannot have an uncountable set such that every point is an isolated point.\" So perhaps the problem is to show that no such uncountable set exists, hence:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers have the standard topology.\n- There exists a set S ⊆ ℝ.\n- S is uncountable.\n- Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a set S cannot exist.\n\nBut this seems to assume the existence of S to reach a contradiction. However, in mathematical proofs, often you assume the existence of such an object to show it leads to a contradiction. But in terms of problem structure, perhaps the problem is more directly stated as proving that every set with isolated points is countable.\n\nGiven the example provided by the user, where the problem was to prove a property for every integer n, but the formatted assumptions included both n being an integer and n being divisible by 7, which seems to add an extra condition not in the original problem, I think there might be an error in the example. However, since the user provided it, I should follow their structure, even if it's inconsistent. But in the current problem, the user's original question is about proving that in the reals with standard topology, there's no uncountable set with all points isolated. Therefore, the problem should be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers are equipped with the standard topology.\n- S is an uncountable subset of ℝ.\n- Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a set S does not exist.\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the example where assumptions are conditions given in the problem (like n being an integer and divisible by 7), perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\n- The real numbers have the standard topology.\n- S is a set where every point is an isolated point.\n- S is uncountable.\n\nProblem: Prove that S cannot exist.\n\nBut to match the user's example, which included all conditions, even those that might be part of the problem statement, I'll list each relevant condition as separate assumptions.\n\nSo, breaking it down line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers are equipped with the standard topology.\n- S is a subset of the real numbers.\n- S is uncountable.\n- Every point in S is an isolated point.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a set S cannot exist.\n\nThis seems to fit the structure: each assumption is a single property of one object (real numbers' topology, S being a subset, S being uncountable, each point in S being isolated). The problem is to show the non-existence of S under these assumptions.",
