    "Content": "Américo Tavares pointed out in his answer to this question that finding the ratio of a geometric progression only from knowledge of the sum of its first $n+1$ terms $S = 1+x+x^2+\\cdots+x^n$ amounts to solving a polynomial of degree $n$. This suggested to me that there might be up to $n$ real solutions of $x$ for a given sum, but I could not find any. In fact, it turned out that the following fact is true: For $n \\ge 1$ and $S \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the polynomial equation $x^n + x^{n-1} + \\cdots + x + 1 = S$ has at most two real solutions. A corollary is that if $n$ is odd, there is exactly one real solution. I was only able to prove this using a rather contrived geometric argument based on the shape of the graph of $y = x^{n+1}$. Is there a simple, direct (and ideally, intuitive) proof of this fact?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In between the previous two answers - one very specific and one very general, there is the following one: Rolle's theorem states that between any two zeros of the function lies a zero of the derivative. So each time you differentiate the number of real roots can not decrease by more than 1. This actually holds with multiplicity as well - if a root is of multiplicity k, then it is of multiplicity (k-1) for the derivative, and there are still roots of the derivative strictly between consecutive distinct roots of the original function. So $x^{n+1}−Sx+S−1$ has at most one root more than $(n+1)x^n-S$ and at most two more than $n(n+1)x^{n-1}$, so not more than three total (counted with multiplicity). One of those is $x=1$, so there are no more than two for the $1+x+\\ldots+x^n=S$. QED.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"Why does the polynomial equation 1 + x + x² + ... + xⁿ = S have at most two solutions in x?\" Then the user, Américo Tavares, mentioned that solving for the ratio x given the sum S of a geometric series leads to a polynomial of degree n. The user initially thought there could be up to n real solutions, but found that there are at most two. They want a simpler proof rather than their geometric approach using the graph of y = x^{n+1}.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. Let me parse the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem is about the equation 1 + x + x² + ... + xⁿ = S. The user states that this equation has at most two real solutions for x given real S and n ≥ 1. A corollary is mentioned for odd n, but the main problem is the \"at most two solutions\" part.\n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n- The equation is a polynomial of degree n: 1 + x + x² + ... + xⁿ = S. But wait, the left-hand side (LHS) is a geometric series sum. For real x ≠ 1, this equals (x^{n+1} - 1)/(x - 1). However, when x = 1, the sum is n+1. So the equation can be rewritten as (x^{n+1} - 1)/(x - 1) = S when x ≠ 1, and x = 1 is a solution only if S = n+1.\n\nBut the original problem is given as 1 + x + x² + ... + xⁿ = S. So perhaps the assumptions include that x is a real number, S is a real number, and n is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n\nWait, the user states \"For n ≥ 1 and S ∈ ℝ, the polynomial equation xⁿ + x^{n−1} + ⋯ + x + 1 = S has at most two real solutions.\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n2. S is a real number.\n3. x is a real number (since we're talking about real solutions).\n\nBut in the problem statement, these are conditions. However, according to the example provided, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1,\nS is a real number,\nx is a real number.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, and the user structured the assumption as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in the given problem here, the problem is for n ≥ 1 and S ∈ ℝ, the equation has at most two real solutions. So the key assumptions here are n is at least 1 and S is real. Since the problem is about real solutions, x is real is inherent in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the polynomial equation ... has at most two real solutions.\" So the variables are x, and the parameters are n and S. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer with n ≥ 1.\n- S is a real number.\n\nBut x being real is part of the problem's context (solutions in x), so maybe not listed as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So perhaps any conditions on variables and parameters need to be listed.\n\nBut in this problem, the variables are x, and the parameters are n and S. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n ≥ 1.\n3. S is a real number.\n4. The equation is in terms of real variable x.\n\nBut the problem statement is: For n ≥ 1 and S ∈ ℝ, the equation has at most two real solutions. So the key conditions are n ≥ 1 and S ∈ ℝ, with x being real. But the problem is to show that under these conditions, there are at most two real x solving the equation. So the user is considering x as a real variable, n as an integer ≥1, S as real.\n\nSo in the assumption section, the user would list:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n ≥ 1,\n- S is a real number.\n\nBut perhaps \"the equation is considered over real numbers\" is also an assumption. However, since the problem states \"real solutions\", maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. The original example didn't mention \"real\" in the assumption, but the problem statement included \"divisible by 91\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer,\nAssumption: n ≥ 1,\nAssumption: S is a real number,\nProblem: Prove that the equation 1 + x + x² + ... + xⁿ = S has at most two real solutions in x.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"For n ≥ 1 and S ∈ ℝ, the polynomial equation...\". So the assumptions are n ≥ 1 and S ∈ ℝ, and the problem is about the equation in x. So the variable x is real by context.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n ≥ 1,\n- S is a real number.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove that the equation has at most two real solutions.\n\nWait, but in the original example, they had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, the assumption was n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So maybe the user edited the problem to include additional constraints? Wait, in the original problem, the user had A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is an integer, n divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. So perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrects it? Or maybe the example is hypothetical.\n\nIn any case, the example shows that each assumption is a single condition on one object. So for the current problem, the user wants to structure the assumptions as:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n ≥ 1,\n- S is a real number.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove that the equation 1 + x + x² + ... + xⁿ = S has at most two real solutions in x.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentioned that for odd n, there is exactly one solution. However, the main problem is about at most two solutions. So the problem is correctly captured as above.\n\nNow, checking if I missed any assumptions. The equation is a sum of a geometric series, but unless there's a specific condition on x (like x ≠ 1), but the problem is about real solutions, which includes x =1 if applicable. But in the problem statement, x can be any real number. So the only assumptions are on n and S.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1,\nS is a real number.\nProblem:\nProve that the equation $$1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^n = S$$ has at most two real solutions in $x$.\n\nBut the original title of the question was \"Why does the polynomial equation 1 + x + x² + ... + xⁿ = S have at most two solutions in x?\" So the problem is to show that there are at most two real solutions. The user also mentions that if n is odd, there is exactly one real solution, but that is a corollary. The main problem is the at most two part.\n\nSo this seems correct. Let me check if there are any other hidden assumptions. For example, if x=1 is a solution when S = n+1, but that's part of the problem's scope. The problem statement doesn't exclude any particular cases, so the assumptions are as listed.\n\nAnother thing: The polynomial equation is of degree n. Normally, a degree n polynomial can have up to n real roots, but here it's claimed to have at most two. The user's question is why, so the problem is correctly structured.",
