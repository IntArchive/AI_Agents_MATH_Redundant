    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers as n approaches infinity is the golden ratio, φ = (√5 + 1)/2. \n\nLooking at the problem, the key elements are:\n1. The limit as n approaches infinity.\n2. The ratio F_{n+1}/F_n.\n3. The Fibonacci sequence F_n is involved.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The example provided in the prompt lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nWhat are the assumptions here? The problem states that F_n is the nth Fibonacci number. So one assumption is that F_n is defined as the Fibonacci sequence. Another assumption might be that the limit is taken as n approaches infinity. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variables and conditions, like n being an integer or divisible by 7. Here, the main assumptions are the definition of the Fibonacci sequence and perhaps the existence of the limit, but since the problem is to prove the limit equals φ, maybe the existence is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. So perhaps the only explicit assumption here is that F_n is the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"nth Fibonacci number\", so the assumption is that F_n follows the Fibonacci recurrence. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nF_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} with initial conditions F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1.\n\nBut the original problem as stated in the user's example didn't include all the definitions. For example, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove the limit, so maybe the key assumptions are the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. However, the original question as presented doesn't restate the Fibonacci definition; it just mentions F_n is the nth Fibonacci number. So perhaps the assumption is that F_n is the Fibonacci sequence. But in the example, they listed n being an integer and divisible by 7 as separate assumptions, even though the original problem statement said \"for every integer n\". So maybe here, the assumptions should be:\n\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the problem is to show that the limit equals φ. The initial conditions are part of the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, which might be considered an assumption. However, perhaps in the context of this problem, the key assumptions are just that F_n is the Fibonacci sequence, and n approaches infinity. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption that n is an integer. Then there was an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. Wait, in the example, the user's formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a wrong example? Wait, the user provided an example where the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user's example is correct in their own context. Anyway, perhaps the user wants to extract all the conditions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to prove that the limit of F_{n+1}/F_n as n approaches infinity is φ. The problem mentions that F_n is the nth Fibonacci number. So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n2. The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut do I need to break down the Fibonacci sequence's definition into separate assumptions? For instance, the recurrence relation and initial conditions. However, in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables' properties rather than the definitions. The example's problem was about divisibility, so the assumptions were about n's properties. Here, the problem is about the limit of a ratio in a sequence defined by recurrence. Maybe the key assumption is that F_n follows the Fibonacci recurrence. But in the problem statement, it's given that F_n is the Fibonacci number, so maybe that's sufficient as an assumption. Alternatively, if the problem requires the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, but the user's example didn't include such detailed assumptions. The example only listed the properties of n, not the objects in the problem. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then, there was an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in the example:\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's modifying the original problem. That might be an error in the example. Maybe the user intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. If the problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is that n is an integer. But the formatted example adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. That's confusing. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow their structure regardless.\n\nIn any case, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question doesn't have any additional conditions; it's a general proof about the limit. Therefore, maybe the only assumption is that F_n is the Fibonacci sequence, defined by the recurrence relation. However, since the problem statement mentions F_n is the nth Fibonacci number, perhaps that's the assumption. Let me look at the original problem again:\n\nOriginal question: How to prove that $\\lim \\limits_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$ where $F_n$ is the nth Fibonacci number and φ is the Golden Ratio.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n2. The limit is as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut since the Fibonacci numbers are defined by their recurrence relation, maybe that's an assumption as well. However, in the example, the assumptions were only about the variable's properties (n being integer and divisible by 7), not about the objects in the problem (like A(n) being defined in a certain way). So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n- The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the limit equals φ. The Fibonacci sequence's definition is part of the problem's setup, so it's an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\nF_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}=\\varphi$$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem includes φ as the Golden Ratio. Should that be an assumption? Probably not, since φ is defined as (√5 +1)/2, which is part of the problem's statement. The problem is to show the limit equals that value. So perhaps the assumptions are just about F_n being Fibonacci and the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recurrence relation is an assumption. For example, if the Fibonacci sequence is defined by F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}, with F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1. But in the problem statement, it's just mentioned that F_n is the nth Fibonacci number. So perhaps the detailed definition is considered given and part of the assumption. However, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". Similarly, here, the assumption is that F_n is the Fibonacci number, as given in the problem. So following the example's approach, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nF_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}=\\varphi$$.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that the Fibonacci sequence is defined with the standard recurrence. But since the problem statement doesn't specify, maybe just stating that F_n is the Fibonacci number is sufficient. The user's example didn't elaborate on the definition of A(n), just listed n's properties. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n1. F_n is the nth Fibonacci number.\n2. The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nF_n is the nth Fibonacci number,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}=\\varphi$$.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The key points are the definition of F_n and the limit process.",
