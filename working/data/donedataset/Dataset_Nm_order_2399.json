    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is to show that for every prime p, there exists an integer n such that 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 is divisible by p. Hmm. The user mentioned using Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT), which is a good start. Let me recall FLT: if p is a prime and a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. So, for a given prime p, exponents can be reduced modulo p-1 when working mod p. \n\nFirst, let's note that p is a prime, so we can apply FLT to numbers not divisible by p. But 2, 3, and 6—are these coprime to p? Well, p is a prime, so unless p is 2, 3, or 2 and 3 (if p=2 or 3), then 2, 3, and 6 would be coprime. Wait, but 6 is 2*3, so if p is 2 or 3, 6 is not coprime to p. So maybe we need to handle the cases p=2, p=3, and p≠2,3 separately.\n\nLet me check for p=2 first. If p=2, then we need to find n such that 2^n + 3^n + 6^n -1 ≡ 0 mod 2. Let's compute each term mod 2. 2^n ≡ 0 mod 2 for any n≥1. 3 is odd, so 3^n ≡ 1 mod 2. 6 is even, so 6^n ≡ 0 mod 2. Thus, 0 + 1 + 0 -1 = 0 mod 2. So for p=2, any n≥1 works. So n exists (e.g., n=1).\n\nSimilarly, for p=3. Let's compute 2^n + 3^n +6^n -1 mod 3. 2^n mod 3: depends on n. 3^n ≡0 mod 3. 6 is divisible by 3, so 6^n ≡0 mod 3. Thus, expression becomes 2^n +0 +0 -1 = 2^n -1 mod 3. We need 2^n ≡1 mod 3. Since 2^2=4≡1 mod 3, so n=2 works. Therefore, for p=3, n=2 is a solution.\n\nNow, for primes p≠2,3. Then 2,3,6 are all coprime to p. So FLT applies. That means 2^(p-1) ≡1 mod p, same for 3 and 6. Let's consider the expression 2^n +3^n +6^n -1 ≡0 mod p. We need to find n such that this holds.\n\nBut 6=2*3, so 6^n=2^n*3^n. So maybe rewrite the expression as 2^n +3^n + (2*3)^n -1. Let's factor 2^n +3^n + (2^n*3^n) -1. Hmm. Let's factor 2^n*3^n as (2*3)^n, which is 6^n. Alternatively, maybe set x=2^n and y=3^n. Then the expression becomes x + y + xy -1. Let's see: x + y + xy -1 = (x+1)(y+1) -2. Wait, expanding (x+1)(y+1) = xy +x + y +1. So if we subtract 2, we get xy +x + y +1 -2 = xy +x + y -1. Which is our expression. So, 2^n +3^n +6^n -1 = (2^n +1)(3^n +1) -2. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor as x + y + xy -1. Let's see:\n\nx + y + xy -1 = x(1 + y) + y -1. Not sure. Maybe consider adding 1 and subtracting 1:\n\nx + y + xy -1 = x + y + xy -1 = (x +1)(y +1) -2. As before. So, (2^n +1)(3^n +1) ≡2 mod p. So we need (2^n +1)(3^n +1) ≡2 mod p. Hmm. Maybe set (2^n +1)(3^n +1) ≡2 mod p. Let me think if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider choosing n such that 2^n ≡ a mod p and 3^n ≡ b mod p, then the equation becomes a + b + ab -1 ≡0 mod p. Which can be written as (a+1)(b+1) ≡2 mod p. Because a + b + ab = (a+1)(b+1) -1. So (a+1)(b+1) -1 -1 ≡0 mod p ⇒ (a+1)(b+1) ≡2 mod p.\n\nBut how do we choose a and b such that this holds? Alternatively, since a=2^n and b=3^n, then (2^n +1)(3^n +1) ≡2 mod p. So we need to find n such that this product is congruent to 2 mod p.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set n ≡0 mod (p-1), so that by Fermat's Little Theorem, 2^n ≡1 mod p, 3^n ≡1 mod p, and 6^n= (2*3)^n ≡1*1=1 mod p. Then the expression becomes 1 +1 +1 -1=2 mod p. Not zero. So that's 2 mod p, which is not zero unless p=2. But p≠2, so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take n= -1 mod (p-1)? Wait, exponents are modulo p-1. So n can be written as k*(p-1) + m. Let's let n be some exponent. Maybe choose n=1. Then the expression is 2 +3 +6 -1=10. So 10 mod p. If 10 ≡0 mod p, then p divides 10. So p=2 or 5. So for primes p=2,5, n=1 works. But for other primes, n=1 might not work.\n\nAlternatively, n=2. Then 4 +9 +36 -1=48. 48 mod p. So p divides 48 if p=2,3. Which we already handled. So n=2 works for p=2,3. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe we need a different approach. Let's consider the equation 2^n +3^n +6^n ≡1 mod p. Let's divide both sides by 6^n. Then we have (2/6)^n + (3/6)^n +1 ≡ (1/6)^n mod p. Simplify fractions: (1/3)^n + (1/2)^n +1 ≡ (1/6)^n mod p. Hmm, not sure if helpful. Alternatively, multiply both sides by 6^n. Wait, that's just the original equation. Maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Let me consider using the multiplicative inverses. For primes p≠2,3, 2,3,6 have inverses mod p. Let's set x=2^n and y=3^n. Then our equation is x + y + xy ≡1 mod p. Let's rearrange: x + y + xy =1. Factor: x(1 + y) + y =1. Hmm. Alternatively, add 1 to both sides: x + y + xy +1 =2. Then factor: (x +1)(y +1)=2. So (2^n +1)(3^n +1)≡2 mod p. So we need to find n such that (2^n +1)(3^n +1)≡2 mod p.\n\nThis seems like a key equation. So we need to solve (2^n +1)(3^n +1) ≡2 mod p. Let me denote a=2^n and b=3^n. Then (a +1)(b +1)=2 mod p. Expanding gives ab +a +b +1=2 mod p ⇒ ab +a +b=1 mod p. But ab=6^n. So 6^n +2^n +3^n=1 mod p. Wait, but that's exactly the original equation. So this didn't give us new information. But maybe if we can relate a and b.\n\nSince 3= (6/2), so 3^n=6^n / 2^n. So b=6^n / 2^n. So substituting into (a +1)(b +1)=2, we get (a +1)(6^n/(2^n) +1)=2 mod p. But a=2^n, so 6^n= (2*3)^n=2^n*3^n=a*b. Wait, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that 2 and 3 are coprime to p, so we can let x=2^n and y=3^n. Then, since 6=2*3, 6^n=x*y. So the equation becomes x + y + x*y ≡1 mod p. Which is similar to before. Let's add 1 to both sides: x + y + x*y +1 =2 mod p. Then, as before, (x +1)(y +1)=2 mod p. So, we need to find x and y such that this product is 2 mod p. But x=2^n and y=3^n. So, the problem reduces to finding n such that (2^n +1)(3^n +1)≡2 mod p.\n\nNow, since 2 and 3 are generators modulo p (if p is a prime where 2 and 3 are primitive roots), but that's not necessarily true. However, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, we can represent 2 and 3 as elements of this group. Let me denote the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p as ord_p(2), and similarly ord_p(3). Let’s let d = lcm(ord_p(2), ord_p(3)). Then, for exponents n, the values of 2^n and 3^n cycle every d steps. So, there are finitely many possibilities for (2^n +1)(3^n +1) mod p. If none of them give 2 mod p, then the equation would have no solution. But the problem states that for every prime p, such an n exists. So, there must be a solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the pigeonhole principle. Since there are p-1 possible residues for 2^n and 3^n modulo p (since they are in the multiplicative group), but their exponents cycle with periods dividing p-1. So over n=0,1,...,p-2, the pairs (2^n, 3^n) must repeat. So by pigeonhole, there must be some repetition. But I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider the equation (2^n +1)(3^n +1)≡2 mod p. Let’s denote this as (2^n +1)(3^n +1) -2 ≡0 mod p. Expand this: 2^n*3^n +2^n +3^n +1 -2 ≡0 mod p ⇒ 6^n +2^n +3^n -1 ≡0 mod p. Which is the original equation. So no progress.\n\nWait, but if we can find n such that (2^n +1)(3^n +1) ≡2 mod p, then we are done. Let's see if there's a way to choose n such that this product is 2. For example, set 2^n +1 ≡1 mod p and 3^n +1 ≡2 mod p. Then their product would be 1*2=2. Similarly, 2^n +1 ≡2 and 3^n +1≡1. Or 2^n +1≡ -1 and 3^n +1≡-2, but that might not work since p is prime. Let's try specific cases.\n\nCase 1: Suppose 2^n ≡0 mod p. But since p≠2, 2 is invertible, so 2^n cannot be 0. Similarly for 3^n and 6^n. So, all terms are non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, set 2^n +1 ≡1 ⇒ 2^n ≡0 mod p. But again, p≠2, so impossible. So that approach won't work.\n\nAlternatively, set 2^n +1=2 mod p ⇒ 2^n ≡1 mod p. Similarly, 3^n +1=1 mod p ⇒ 3^n≡0 mod p. But p≠3, so 3^n≡0 impossible. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, set 2^n +1 ≡a mod p and 3^n +1 ≡b mod p where a*b=2 mod p. So we need to solve for a and b such that a*b=2, and then find n such that 2^n ≡a-1 and 3^n ≡b-1. Since a and b can be any pair with product 2, maybe there exists such a pair where a-1 and b-1 are powers of 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Maybe a better approach is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or Hensel's lemma, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For primes p≠2,3, consider the equation 2^n +3^n +6^n ≡1 mod p. Let's divide both sides by 6^n (which is invertible since p≠2,3). Then we get (2/6)^n + (3/6)^n +1 ≡ (1/6)^n mod p. Simplify fractions: (1/3)^n + (1/2)^n +1 ≡ (1/6)^n mod p. Let me denote a=1/2 mod p and b=1/3 mod p. Then the equation becomes (a^{-1})^n + (b^{-1})^n +1 ≡ (a^{-1}b^{-1})^n mod p. Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, since a=2^{-1} and b=3^{-1}, then (1/2)^n = a^n and (1/3)^n = b^n. So the equation is a^n + b^n +1 ≡ (6^{-1})^n mod p. But 6^{-1} is (2*3)^{-1}=a*b. So (6^{-1})^n = (a*b)^n. So the equation is a^n + b^n +1 ≡ (a*b)^n mod p. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me set x=2^n and y=3^n. Then 6^n=x*y. So the equation is x + y + x*y ≡1 mod p. Let's factor this as x + y + x*y = x(1 + y) + y = y(1 + x) + x. Not helpful. Alternatively, add 1 to both sides: x + y + x*y +1 =2 mod p. Then factor as (x +1)(y +1)=2 mod p. So we need to find n such that (x +1)(y +1)=2 mod p. \n\nNow, since x=2^n and y=3^n, maybe take n such that 2^n ≡1 mod p. Then x=1, so (1+1)(y+1)=2(y+1)=2 mod p ⇒ 2(y+1)=2 ⇒ y+1=1 ⇒ y=0. But y=3^n=0 mod p only if p=3, which we already handled. So that's only applicable for p=3. Similarly, if y=3^n ≡1 mod p, then (x+1)(1+1)=2(x+1)=2 ⇒ x+1=1 ⇒ x=0, which only works if p=2. So those cases are already covered.\n\nBut for general p≠2,3, we need another approach. Maybe consider the multiplicative inverses. Let’s rearrange (x +1)(y +1)=2 mod p. Let’s solve for y in terms of x: y +1=2/(x +1) mod p ⇒ y= (2/(x +1)) -1 mod p. So y= (2 - (x +1))/(x +1)= (1 -x)/(x +1) mod p. So 3^n= y= (1 -x)/(x +1)= (1 -2^n)/(2^n +1) mod p. \n\nSo we need to find n such that 3^n ≡ (1 -2^n)/(2^n +1) mod p. Let me check if this is possible. Let’s cross-multiply: 3^n*(2^n +1) ≡1 -2^n mod p. Expand left side: 3^n*2^n +3^n ≡1 -2^n mod p. Then bring all terms to left: 6^n +3^n +2^n -1 ≡0 mod p. Which is the original equation. So again, circular.\n\nPerhaps we need to use the fact that the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic. Let’s let g be a primitive root mod p. Then every non-zero element can be written as g^k for some k. So 2=g^a and 3=g^b for some integers a,b. Then 6=g^{a+b}. So our equation becomes g^{a n} + g^{b n} + g^{(a + b) n} ≡1 mod p. Hmm. Not sure if helpful, but maybe take logarithms. Let’s let m be such that g^m ≡1 mod p. Then, since the multiplicative group has order p-1, exponents are modulo p-1. But this might not simplify things.\n\nAlternatively, since the group is cyclic, perhaps consider that for some n, the exponents a n, b n, and (a + b) n satisfy some relationship. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider the case when n= p-2. Then by Fermat’s Little Theorem, 2^{p-2} ≡ 2^{-1} mod p, similarly 3^{p-2}≡3^{-1} mod p, and 6^{p-2}≡6^{-1} mod p. Then the expression becomes 2^{-1} +3^{-1} +6^{-1} -1 mod p. Let's compute this:\n\nLet’s compute 2^{-1} +3^{-1} +6^{-1}. Let's denote inv2=2^{-1}, inv3=3^{-1}. Then 6^{-1}=inv2*inv3. So inv2 + inv3 + inv2*inv3 -1. Let's factor inv2*(1 + inv3) + inv3 -1. Not sure. Let's compute numerically. Let's take p=7. Then inv2=4, inv3=5, inv6=6^{-1}=6. So 4 +5 +6=15 ≡1 mod 7. Then 1 -1=0. So 0 mod 7. So for p=7, n=5 (since p-2=5) works. Indeed, 2^5=32≡4, 3^5=243≡5, 6^5=7776≡6 mod7. So 4+5+6-1=14≡0 mod7. So n=p-2 works for p=7.\n\nSimilarly, let's check p=5. p-2=3. inv2=3, inv3=2, inv6=6^{-1}=1 (since 6≡1 mod5, so inv6=1). So 3+2+1=6≡1 mod5. 1 -1=0 mod5. So 2^3 +3^3 +6^3 -1=8 +27 +216 -1=250≡0 mod5. 250/5=50. Yes. So for p=5, n=3 works.\n\nSimilarly, p=11. p-2=9. inv2=6, inv3=4, inv6=6^{-1}=2 (since 6*2=12≡1 mod11). So 6+4+2=12≡1 mod11. 1-1=0. So 2^9 +3^9 +6^9 -1 mod11. Let's compute 2^9=512≡512-44*11=512-484=28≡6 mod11. 3^9=19683. Let's compute 3^2=9, 3^4=81≡4, 3^8=4^2=16≡5, so 3^9=5*3=15≡4 mod11. 6^9: 6^2=36≡3, 6^4=9, 6^8=81≡4, 6^9=4*6=24≡2 mod11. So 6+4+2 -1=11≡0 mod11. So yes, n=9 works. So this seems to work for p=5,7,11. Maybe n=p-2 works in general.\n\nSo conjecture: For any prime p≠2,3, taking n=p-2 makes 2^n +3^n +6^n -1 divisible by p. Let's test p=13. p-2=11. inv2=7, inv3=9, inv6=6^{-1}=11 mod13. So 7+9+11=27≡1 mod13. 1-1=0. Compute 2^11 mod13: 2^12≡1, so 2^11≡2^{-1}=7 mod13. 3^11: 3^12≡1, so 3^11≡3^{-1}=9 mod13. 6^11: 6^12≡1, so 6^11≡6^{-1}=11 mod13. So 7+9+11=27≡1 mod13. 1-1=0. So works.\n\nSimilarly, p=17. p-2=15. inv2=9, inv3=6, inv6=6^{-1}=3 mod17 (since 6*3=18≡1). So 9+6+3=18≡1 mod17. 1-1=0. So 2^15 +3^15 +6^15 -1 ≡9 +6 +3 -1=17≡0 mod17. Yes. So it seems that n=p-2 works. Therefore, the solution is to take n=p-2 for primes p≠2,3, and for p=2,3, we already have solutions. Therefore, for every prime p, there exists an integer n (specifically, n=p-2 for p≠2,3 and n=1 for p=2,3) such that 2^n +3^n +6^n -1 is divisible by p.\n\nBut wait, we need to verify for p=2 and p=3. For p=2, n=1: 2+3+6-1=10, which is 0 mod2. For p=3, n=2: 4+9+36-1=48, which is 0 mod3. So yes. Therefore, the general solution is n=1 for p=2,3 and n=p-2 otherwise. But the problem says \"there is an integer n\", so we just need existence. So this works.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to choose n=p-2 for primes p≠2,3, and n=1 or 2 for p=2,3. Hence, such an n always exists.",
