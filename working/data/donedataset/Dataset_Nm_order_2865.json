    "Content": "Ok so I have heard that the only regular polygons which can completely fill the plane without overlapping are the 3,4 and 6 sided ones. I have also heard about Penrose tilings but this question ignores them. How can one prove that there isn't another polygon which can completely tile the plane only by itself? Regards",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Well, if you tile the plane by congruent regular polygons, there must be $n$ polygons meeting at each vertex.  Thus the interior angles of each polygon must be $2\\pi/n$, for some positive integer $n$. For $n=3$, we get polygons with angles of $2\\pi/3$, which are regular hexagons.  This tiling has three regular hexagons meeting at each vertex. For $n=4$, we get polygons with angles of $2\\pi/4 = \\pi/2$, which are squares.  This tiling has four squares meeting at each vertex. For $n=5$, the polygons would need to have angles of $2\\pi/5$.  This is not possible for a regular polygon. For $n=6$, the polygons would need to have angles of $2\\pi/6 = \\pi/3$, which are equilateral triangles.  This tiling has six triangles meeting at each vertex. For $n>6$, the polygons would need to have angles less than $\\pi/3$, which is impossible. Edit: As Blue points out below, this argument neglects tilings such as the brick wall tiling, where vertices of one polygon meet edges of another.  See Steven Stadnicki's comment for the resolution of this case.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. So, first, I need to identify all the assumptions in the original question.\n\nThe original question is about why only triangles, squares, and hexagons can tile the plane. The user mentions regular polygons and that the tiling is without overlapping. Also, Penrose tilings are excluded. The problem is to prove that no other regular polygons can do this.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. The polygons are regular. The question says \"the only regular polygons which can completely fill the plane...\" so the first assumption is that the polygon is regular.\n\n2. The tiling must cover the plane completely without overlapping. The question states \"completely fill the plane without overlapping.\"\n\n3. The problem excludes non-regular tilings like Penrose, so the focus is only on tilings using the same regular polygon. So another assumption is that the tiling uses only one type of polygon, i.e., monohedral tiling.\n\nWait, does the original question specify monohedral tiling? The user says \"only by itself,\" which means each tile is the same regular polygon. So yes, that's an assumption: the tiling is monohedral with regular polygons.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The polygon is regular.\n- The tiling covers the plane completely without gaps or overlaps.\n- The tiling uses only congruent copies of the polygon (monohedral).\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"the only polygons with which it is possible to tile a plane.\" So the main question is about regular polygons, monohedral tilings. So the assumptions are all about the polygon being regular, the tiling being monohedral, and covering the plane without gaps or overlaps.\n\nTherefore, in the assumption section, each line should address one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polygon is regular,\n- The tiling covers the plane without gaps,\n- The tiling covers the plane without overlaps,\n- The tiling uses only congruent copies of the polygon.\n\nWait, maybe the last two can be combined? Because \"without overlapping\" and \"covers the plane\" (no gaps) are separate. Also, \"uses only congruent copies\" is another condition.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polygon is regular.\n- The tiling covers the plane without gaps.\n- The tiling has no overlaps.\n- The tiling uses congruent copies of the polygon.\n\nBut perhaps the last one can be phrased as \"the tiling is monohedral,\" but since the user might not know that term, maybe it's better to state it as \"the tiling uses only copies of a single polygon.\" Wait, the original question says \"another polygon which can completely tile the plane only by itself,\" so \"only by itself\" implies that the tiling uses only that polygon, so the assumption is that it's monohedral. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polygon is regular.\n- The tiling covers the plane without gaps.\n- The tiling has no overlapping tiles.\n- The tiling uses only copies of the same polygon.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove that the only such polygons are triangles, squares, and hexagons.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the problem was stated as \"for every integer n\". The user corrected the problem to have the assumption of divisibility by 7. So in the example, they filtered out the possible missing assumptions. In this case, the original question says \"the only regular polygons which can completely fill the plane without overlapping\" so the assumptions are:\n\n1. Regular polygon.\n\n2. Tiling is without gaps.\n\n3. Tiling is without overlaps.\n\n4. The tiling uses only that polygon (monohedral).\n\nSo each of these should be separate lines. Then the problem is to prove that only 3, 4, and 6-sided polygons satisfy these assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together.",
