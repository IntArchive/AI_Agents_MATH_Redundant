    "Content": "I was recently reading a proof in which the following property is used (and left as an exercise that I could not prove so far). Here is exactly how it is stated. Let $G$ be a finite group. Suppose it has exactly one maximal subgroup. Then $G$ is cyclic. Now, does this mean exactly one conjugacy class of maximal subgroups ? If it really means exactly one maximal subgroup , then what can we say about a finite group that possesses exactly one class of (at least two) maximal subgroups that are all conjugate to each other?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $G$ has only one conjugacy class of maximal subgroup, $M$, and is not itself a $p$-group, then for every prime $p$, $M$ contains a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$.  But then by Lagrange, $|M|$ has order divisible by every prime power dividing $|G|$, so $|M|$ is a multiple of $|G|$.  Since $|M| \\leq |G|$, one must have $|M| = |G|$ and $M = G$, a contradiction.  If $G$ is a $p$-group and one conjugacy class of maximal subgroup, then every maximal subgroup is normal, and so $G$ must have exactly one maximal subgroup, and so is cyclic as before. In particular, every finite group has at least two classes of maximal subgroups.  The non-abelian group of order 6 has exactly two classes. It is not too uncommon for a finite group to have only one class of maximal subgroup that is not normal, and one that is normal (so two classes total): every finite primitive solvable group is like this.  Depending on your definition, it might just be by definition.  But there are a few definitions that make it sound exciting.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about finite groups with exactly one maximal subgroup. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The main problem is to prove that if a finite group G has exactly one maximal subgroup, then G is cyclic. The user also asks whether \"exactly one maximal subgroup\" might mean \"exactly one conjugacy class of maximal subgroups\" and what happens in that case.\n\nBut the task is to structure the problem given, filtering out unrelated information. The example provided shows that sometimes assumptions like divisibility by 7 are included. In this case, the key assumptions are that G is a finite group and it has exactly one maximal subgroup. The problem is to prove G is cyclic. The follow-up questions about conjugacy classes seem to be additional, but the main problem as stated in the exercise is about exactly one maximal subgroup, not conjugacy classes. However, the user mentions that the original problem's author left it as an exercise and is now questioning the exact interpretation of \"exactly one maximal subgroup\".\n\nWait, the original problem states: \"Let G be a finite group. Suppose it has exactly one maximal subgroup. Then G is cyclic.\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. G has exactly one maximal subgroup.\n\nThe problem is to prove G is cyclic.\n\nThe rest of the question is the user's own confusion about whether the original problem meant conjugacy classes instead. But according to the instructions, I should filter out unrelated information. The user's additional questions (\"does this mean...\", \"what can we say...\") are part of the original Math Stack Exchange question but might not be part of the core problem to structure. However, the original problem as stated by the user is the one to structure.\n\nWait, the problem presented in the Math Stack Exchange question is twofold: the initial problem to prove that a finite group with exactly one maximal subgroup is cyclic, and then the user's own questions about interpretation. The task is to structure the problem as per the example, which in the example only includes the core problem's assumptions and the problem statement. So perhaps the additional questions in the original post are considered unrelated information for the purpose of structuring.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- G has exactly one maximal subgroup.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is cyclic.\n\nThe part about conjugacy classes is the user's own question, which might be considered a separate problem or follow-up, so perhaps it should be excluded. The example given by the user included only the core problem, even though the original problem might have had more context. So following that pattern, I should list the two assumptions and state the problem as proving G is cyclic.",
