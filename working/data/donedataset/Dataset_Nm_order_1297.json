    "Content": "I was once asked in an oral exam whether there can be a symmetric non zero matrix whose square is zero. After some thought I replied that there couldn't be because the minimal polynomial of such a matrix is guaranteed to be $x^2$ which shows that it isn't diagonalizable. I had to further clarify that a matrix is diagonalizable iff its minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors, and that every symmetric matrix is diagonalizable. While all this is correct, the examiner mentioned that there is a simpler argument possible but he didn't elaborate on it. I have since been wondering what that simpler argument could be. Can someone give a simpler proof? Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The $(i,i)^{\\text{th}}$ component of the square of an $n \\times n$ symmetric matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ is given by\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}a_{ji} = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}^2$$\nIf $A \\ne 0$ then some $a_{ij} \\ne 0$, and then $(A^2)_{ii} \\ne 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe original question is about a symmetric non-zero matrix whose square is zero. The user mentioned their approach using minimal polynomials and diagonalization, but the examiner hinted at a simpler argument. The task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement following the example provided.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that the matrix is symmetric, non-zero, and its square is zero. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So the matrix (let's call it M) has three properties: it's symmetric, non-zero, and M squared equals zero.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove that such a matrix cannot exist. The original question is asking for a simpler proof than the one involving minimal polynomials and diagonalization.\n\nWait, the example given in the format included the problem statement as \"Prove that...\" So in this case, the problem would be to show that there's no symmetric non-zero matrix with square zero. But the original question is phrased as whether such a matrix exists, and the answer is no. So structuring the problem as \"Prove that there does not exist a symmetric non-zero matrix whose square is the zero matrix.\"\n\nChecking the example again: The assumption listed each condition on n, but in this case, the matrix's properties are the assumptions. So each line should be one property of the matrix. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is symmetric,\nThe matrix is non-zero,\nThe square of the matrix is the zero matrix.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a matrix cannot exist.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement could be phrased as \"Prove that there does not exist a symmetric non-zero matrix whose square is the zero matrix.\"\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property. So that's three assumptions: symmetry, non-zero, and square is zero. The problem is to show impossibility.",
