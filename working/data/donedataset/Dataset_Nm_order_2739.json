    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The problem states that if a matrix A squared equals the identity matrix (A² = I) and all eigenvalues of A are 1, then we need to prove that A must be the identity matrix itself. The context is that A is a matrix over the complex numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some linear algebra concepts. Since A is over the complex numbers, it's guaranteed that all eigenvalues are in the complex field, which is given here as all being 1. Also, the minimal polynomial of A should divide any polynomial that annihilates A. Here, A² = I implies that A² - I = 0, so the minimal polynomial divides x² - 1. That factors into (x - 1)(x + 1). However, if all eigenvalues are 1, then the minimal polynomial can't have (x + 1) as a factor because that would correspond to an eigenvalue of -1. Therefore, the minimal polynomial must be (x - 1), meaning that A - I = 0, hence A = I.\n\nWait, but maybe I should elaborate more. Let's think step by step.\n\nGiven that all eigenvalues are 1, the characteristic polynomial of A is (x - 1)^n, where n is the size of the matrix. The minimal polynomial must divide (x - 1)^n and also divide x² - 1 because A² = I. So the minimal polynomial must divide both (x - 1)^n and (x - 1)(x + 1). The greatest common divisor of these polynomials is (x - 1), provided that (x + 1) doesn't divide the minimal polynomial. Since all eigenvalues are 1, the minimal polynomial can't have (x + 1) as a root. Therefore, the minimal polynomial must be (x - 1), which implies that A - I = 0, hence A = I.\n\nAlternatively, since all eigenvalues are 1, A is similar to the Jordan form J, which is upper triangular with 1s on the diagonal. Then, J² = I. But if J is a Jordan block, then J² would have 1s on the diagonal and possibly some non-zero entries above the diagonal. For J² to equal I, all those superdiagonal entries must be zero. Therefore, each Jordan block must be 1x1, so J is diagonal, hence J = I, so A is similar to I, which means A = I.\n\nWait, but let's verify that. Suppose J is a Jordan block of size k with eigenvalue 1. Then J² would be a matrix where each entry (i, j) is the sum over l from 1 to k of J(i,l)J(l,j). Since J is upper triangular with 1s on the diagonal and 1s on the superdiagonal. For example, in a 2x2 Jordan block:\n\nJ = [[1, 1], [0, 1]]\n\nThen J² = [[1, 2], [0, 1]]\n\nIf J² must equal the identity matrix, then the (1,2) entry here is 2, which is not 0. That's a problem. Therefore, the only way for J² to be I is if the Jordan blocks are 1x1. Hence, J is diagonal, and since all eigenvalues are 1, J = I. Therefore, A must be similar to I, but the only matrix similar to I is I itself. So A = I.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Since all eigenvalues are 1, the Jordan form of A is a Jordan matrix with 1s on the diagonal.\n2. Given A² = I, the Jordan form J must satisfy J² = I.\n3. If there are any Jordan blocks larger than 1x1, J² would have non-zero superdiagonal entries, contradicting J² = I.\n4. Therefore, all Jordan blocks must be 1x1, so J = I.\n5. Hence, A = I.\n\nAnother approach could be using the fact that since A² = I, A is diagonalizable because its minimal polynomial splits into distinct linear factors (x - 1)(x + 1). But wait, if the minimal polynomial is (x - 1)(x + 1), but all eigenvalues are 1, which contradicts the existence of -1 as a root. Therefore, the minimal polynomial can't have (x + 1), so it must be (x - 1), hence A is diagonalizable and equal to I.\n\nWait, but if A² = I, then the minimal polynomial divides (x² - 1). However, if all eigenvalues are 1, then the minimal polynomial must divide (x - 1). Hence, the minimal polynomial is (x - 1), so A - I = 0, hence A = I.\n\nSo combining these thoughts, the key points are the minimal polynomial must be (x - 1), leading directly to A = I. Therefore, the conclusion is that A must equal the identity matrix.",
