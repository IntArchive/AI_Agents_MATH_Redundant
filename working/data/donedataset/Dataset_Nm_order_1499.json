    "Content": "Martin Brandenburg pointed out elsewhere in the comments that he could give a one line proof, using the Yoneda lemma, of $$\\frac{\\mathbf{C}[x_1,\\ldots,x_{n+m}]}{I(X)^e+I(Y)^e} \\cong \\frac{\\mathbf{C}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]}{I(X)} \\otimes_\\mathbf{C} \\frac{\\mathbf{C}[x_{n+1},\\ldots,x_{n+m}]}{I(Y)}$$ (for $X,Y$ affine algebraic varieties), but apparently the proof was too long for his margin. How can this be done? Fundamental question aside : why is there no abstract nonsense tag?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The claim, I suppose, is that for commutative $k$-algebras $R$ and $S$ and ideals $I \\trianglelefteq R$ and $J \\trianglelefteq S$, we have\n$$(R \\otimes_k S) / (I^e + J^e) \\cong (R / I) \\otimes_k (S / J)$$\nwhere $I^e$ is the extension of $I$ along $R \\to R \\otimes_k S$ and similarly for $J^e$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is about a tensor product of quotient rings and a proof using the Yoneda lemma. The question mentions Martin Brandenburg's one-line proof using Yoneda lemma for a specific isomorphism involving quotient rings. The varieties X and Y are affine algebraic varieties. \n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The rings involved are quotient rings of polynomial rings over **C**. So the base ring is **C**.\n2. The ideals I(X) and I(Y) correspond to affine algebraic varieties X and Y. So X and Y are affine algebraic varieties.\n3. The tensor product is over **C**, which is already mentioned in the equation.\n4. The exponents on the ideals (e.g., I(X)^e) might refer to extension ideals in the larger polynomial ring. But the problem doesn't specify more about these, so maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption.\n\nWait, the equation given is (C[x1,...,xn+m]/(I(X)^e + I(Y)^e)) ≅ (C[x1,...,xn]/I(X)) ⊗_C (C[xn+1,...,xn+m]/I(Y)). So the assumptions here would include that X is an affine algebraic variety in C^n (since I(X) is an ideal in C[x1,...,xn]), and Y is in C^m (since I(Y) is in C[xn+1,...,xn+m]). The ideals I(X)^e and I(Y)^e are their extensions to the larger ring C[x1,...,xn+m].\n\nSo breaking down:\n\n- X is an affine algebraic variety in C^n.\n- Y is an affine algebraic variety in C^m.\n- I(X) is the ideal defining X in C[x1,...,xn].\n- I(Y) is the ideal defining Y in C[xn+1,...,xn+m].\n- The tensor product is over C.\n- The ideals I(X)^e and I(Y)^e are the extensions of I(X) and I(Y) to C[x1,...,xn+m].\n\nEach of these should be separate assumptions. However, the problem might not explicitly state all of them, so I need to infer from the context. The key elements are that X and Y are affine varieties, their ideals are in their respective polynomial rings, and the tensor product is over C.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. X is an affine algebraic variety in C^n.\n2. Y is an affine algebraic variety in C^m.\n3. I(X) is the ideal of X in the polynomial ring C[x1,...,xn].\n4. I(Y) is the ideal of Y in the polynomial ring C[xn+1,...,xn+m].\n5. The tensor product is taken over the field C.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove the isomorphism between the two quotient rings using the Yoneda lemma. The user also mentions a side question about the abstract nonsense tag, but that's not part of the mathematical problem, so we ignore it.\n\nPutting it all together, the assumptions should list each of these conditions, and the problem is to prove the given isomorphism.",
