    "Content": "From a bank of past master's exams I am going through: Let $F$ be a finite field. Show that any function from $F$ to $F$ is a polynomial function. I know that finite fields are fields of $p$ elements for $p$ prime [EDIT: It's actually $p^n$ for $p$ prime; see comment below]. Since I have $p$ choices for the $p$ elements to map to, then I have $p^p$ distinct functions. I think every function can be written in the form $f(x) = a_{p-1}x^{p-1} + \\dots + a_0x^0$. For then given the values $f(0), f(1), \\ldots f(p-1)$, I can solve for the coefficents by the linear system of equations $$ a_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} n^i a_i = f(n).$$ This then gives me a $p-1 \\times p-1$ square matrix over the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$: $$\\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}\n1& 0 & 0 & \\ldots & 0 \\\\\n1& 1 & 1 & \\dots & 1 \\\\\n1& 2 & 4 & \\dots & 2^{p-1} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & p-1 & (p-1)^2 & \\dots & (p-1)^{p-1}\n\\end{array} \\right)\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\na_0 \\\\ a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{p-1}\n\\end{array}\\right) \n=\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\nf(0) \\\\ f(1) \\\\ f(2) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f(p-1)\n\\end{array} \\right)$$ If I can show this matrix is invertible, then I can always find the $a_i$. But I am a bit stumped on how to show this (partially because I don't think I've ever done linear algebra in a vector space over a finite field). It does not seem easy to show linear independence, or nonzero determinant, or full row rank. Alternatively (I just thought of this), can I show this is true by arguing that the map between the two sets (the set of polynomials of degree $p-1$; and the set of functions $F \\to F$) is injective, and that it must be a bijection because the sets have the same cardinality $p^p$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First off, a finite field doesn't necessarily have $p$ elements for $p$ prime. For every prime $p$ and natural number $m>0$ there is a finite field with $p^m$ elements. Second, your approach is sound - the only piece you're missing is that your matrix is a Vandermonde matrix which, over any field, has a simple expression for its determinant.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is to show that any function from a finite field F to itself is a polynomial function. The user mentioned they know finite fields have order p^n for some prime p and positive integer n. They attempted to set up a system of linear equations using a Vandermonde matrix to solve for the coefficients of the polynomial, but got stuck on proving the matrix is invertible. They also considered using an injectivity argument based on equal cardinality of the sets of functions and polynomials.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of finite fields. A finite field F has q = p^n elements, where p is prime and n ≥ 1. The multiplicative group of F is cyclic, which might be useful. Also, in a finite field, every element satisfies x^q = x. This is because the multiplicative group has order q-1, so x^{q-1} = 1 for all x ≠ 0, and multiplying both sides by x gives x^q = x. Therefore, the polynomial x^q - x splits into linear factors over F, having all elements of F as roots.\n\nNow, the user wants to represent any function f: F → F as a polynomial. Let's think about the space of functions. There are q^q functions from F to F. On the polynomial side, the number of distinct polynomial functions is at most q^q since each polynomial of degree less than q can be uniquely determined by its coefficients (each coefficient being an element of F), and there are q coefficients (from degree 0 to q-1). Wait, but if the field has q elements, then the number of polynomials of degree less than q is q^q, right? Because each coefficient can be any of the q elements. So if we can show that each function corresponds to exactly one such polynomial, then we have the result.\n\nBut the user initially considered polynomials of degree up to p-1, but in reality, since the field has q = p^n elements, the correct approach would be to consider polynomials of degree less than q. Because in the case of a prime field (n=1), q = p, so degree less than p. That matches their initial thought. However, in their example, they used p-1 degree, but maybe that's a mistake. Wait, in their matrix, they have p rows (from f(0) to f(p-1)) and p variables (a_0 to a_{p-1}), so it's a p x p matrix. But if F has p elements, then the number of monomials x^0, x^1, ..., x^{p-1} is p, which matches the number of points. So the Vandermonde matrix would be p x p. But in a general finite field of size q = p^n, the number of points is q, so the matrix should be q x q. Wait, the user's original setup seems to conflate p and q here. They refer to F as having p elements, but actually finite fields have order p^n. However, in the problem statement, the user later corrects themselves in a comment, noting that it's actually p^n. So perhaps the problem is stated for a general finite field of order q = p^n, and the user initially thought it was p, but corrected it. Therefore, the correct approach should be for a general finite field F of order q.\n\nNow, the key idea is that the space of polynomial functions from F to F is equal to the space of all functions if every function can be represented by a polynomial. Since both spaces have the same cardinality (q^q), if the map from polynomials (of degree less than q) to functions is injective, then it's also surjective. Therefore, we just need to show that two distinct polynomials of degree less than q cannot induce the same function. Alternatively, the only polynomial of degree less than q that vanishes on all elements of F is the zero polynomial.\n\nWait, but in a finite field F, a non-zero polynomial can have all elements of F as roots. For example, the polynomial x^q - x has every element of F as a root, but its degree is q. So if we restrict to polynomials of degree less than q, then the only polynomial that has all elements as roots is the zero polynomial. That's a key point. Because if a polynomial f of degree d < q has q roots, then by the factor theorem, it must be the zero polynomial. Therefore, if two polynomials of degree less than q agree on all q points of F, they must be identical. Hence, the map from polynomials of degree less than q to functions is injective. Since the number of such polynomials is q^q, which is the same as the number of functions, the map is also surjective. Therefore, every function is representable by such a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the argument using cardinality works once we establish injectivity. The user thought of this, but perhaps didn't make the connection with the degree of the polynomial. The Vandermonde matrix approach would also work because the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix is non-zero if all the evaluation points are distinct, which they are in a field. However, in a finite field, the determinant might be zero modulo the characteristic. Wait, but in the case of the Vandermonde matrix, the determinant is the product of (x_j - x_i) for i < j. Since in a field, if all x_i are distinct, then the determinant is non-zero. Therefore, in our case, if we evaluate at all q elements of F, then the Vandermonde matrix is invertible because the determinant is the product of non-zero terms. Therefore, the matrix is invertible, so the system has a unique solution for the coefficients. Hence, there exists a unique polynomial of degree less than q that interpolates the given function.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user constructed a (p-1) x (p-1) matrix, but if F has p elements, then we need a p x p matrix (since there are p elements, 0 to p-1). The user might have made a mistake here. For example, if F has p elements, then the Vandermonde matrix should be p x p, with rows corresponding to each element of F, and columns corresponding to exponents from 0 to p-1. The determinant of this matrix is non-zero because the elements are distinct, hence the matrix is invertible. Therefore, the coefficients can be uniquely determined, which gives the polynomial.\n\nTherefore, combining both the cardinality argument and the Vandermonde matrix invertibility, we can conclude that every function is a polynomial function. So the problem is essentially about showing that the interpolation is possible because the Vandermonde matrix is invertible, or alternatively, using the injectivity and equal cardinality.\n\nThe user's initial approach was for F of prime order p, but the problem statement mentions finite fields in general, which can have order p^n. However, the same reasoning applies. Let me confirm: For a finite field F with q = p^n elements, the polynomial ring F[x] contains polynomials of degree up to q-1, and any function from F to F can be represented uniquely by a polynomial of degree less than q. The key is that a non-zero polynomial of degree less than q cannot vanish on all q elements of F, so the interpolation is always possible. Hence, the Vandermonde matrix constructed over all elements of F (with exponents from 0 to q-1) will have a non-zero determinant, hence invertible, ensuring a unique solution.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved either by linear algebra (Vandermonde matrix invertibility) or by counting argument (injectivity and equal cardinality). The user's thought process seems to touch on both approaches but needs to reconcile the matrix size and the field order.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The original problem is to show any function from F to F is a polynomial function. Assumptions needed are:\n\n- F is a finite field.\n- The function is from F to F.\n- The polynomial has degree less than the size of F.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't mention the degree, so the assumptions might not need that. Wait, the problem is to show that any function is a polynomial function. So the assumptions are:\n\n- F is a finite field.\n- The function is from F to F.\n\nBut in the user's attempt, they considered polynomials of degree up to p-1, which would correspond to the size of the field if F has p elements. But for a general finite field with q elements, the degree needs to be less than q. Therefore, the key assumption is that F is finite. Therefore, the formatted problem should list assumptions related to F being finite and the function's domain and codomain being F.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in this problem, the original problem doesn't state any assumptions beyond F being a finite field and the function being from F to F.\n\nWait, let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That contradicts. Wait, the example might be incorrect. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems like a mistake because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That's incorrect. Perhaps the example is wrong. But regardless, according to the user's instruction, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem about finite fields, the assumptions should be:\n\n- F is a finite field.\n- The function is from F to F.\n\nBut the problem is to show any such function is a polynomial function. So the assumptions are inherent in the problem statement. Maybe the user's example was incorrect, but following their instruction, we need to list all assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a finite field,\nThe function is from F to F.\nProblem:\nShow that any function from F to F is a polynomial function.\n\nBut the original problem's assumptions are already given as F being a finite field and the function being from F to F. Since the problem is \"Show that any function from F to F is a polynomial function,\" the assumptions are just the givens in the problem. The example provided by the user may have added an incorrect assumption, but following the correct approach, the assumptions here are just the basic premises of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, if there's any hidden assumption, like the function being arbitrary, but that's part of the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a finite field,\nThe function is from F to F.\nProblem:\nShow that the function is a polynomial function.\n\nBut the problem is about any function, so the function is arbitrary. Maybe the assumptions are only about F being a finite field, since the function is given to be from F to F. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a finite field.\nProblem:\nShow that any function from F to F is a polynomial function.\n\nThis seems sufficient. The example given by the user had redundant or incorrect assumptions, but following logically, the key assumption here is F being a finite field.",
