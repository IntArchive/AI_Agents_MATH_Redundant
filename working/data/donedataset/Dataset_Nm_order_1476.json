    "Content": "The Hermite polynomials are defined as $$H_n(x)=(-1)^n e^{x^2}\\dfrac{d^n}{dx^n}e^{-x^2}.$$ How does one prove that all the roots of the Hermite polynomial are real?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By induction, $H_n$ is a polynomial of degree $n$.  Its roots are the zeros of $u_n(x) = \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x^2}$.  But by Rolle's theorem, between any two zeros of a differentiable function there is a zero of its derivative.  The same is true between a zero and $+\\infty$ or $-\\infty$ for a function that goes to $0$ at $\\pm \\infty$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem about Hermite polynomials. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the given question on Math Stack Exchange.\n\nThe original question is: \"The roots of Hermite polynomials are all real?\" The user defines the Hermite polynomials as H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²}. They are asking how to prove all roots are real.\n\nNow, looking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is about Hermite polynomials. So, what are the assumptions here?\n\nThe question itself doesn't state any additional conditions; it just defines the Hermite polynomials and asks to prove all roots are real. However, the definition of Hermite polynomials might imply some standard properties. For instance, Hermite polynomials are typically considered for integer degrees n ≥ 0. Also, the definition given uses the physicist's version (since it's H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²}), which is standard.\n\nSo, possible assumptions could be:\n\n1. H_n(x) is the Hermite polynomial of degree n.\n2. n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the original question doesn't explicitly mention that n is a non-negative integer, but since we're talking about polynomials of degree n, that's an implicit assumption. Similarly, the problem is about the roots being real, so the polynomial is defined over the reals. However, in the problem statement, these might need to be made explicit as assumptions according to the format.\n\nWait, but the example included assumptions that were perhaps part of the problem but not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the first assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then the second assumption was \"n is divisible by 7\", but that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, actually, in the example, the user's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, no, looking back: the original example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions were: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so why is there an assumption that n is divisible by 7? That seems like a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe the example was wrong? Because if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumptions shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Unless there was a typo. Wait, maybe the original problem was different. Wait, maybe the original problem had a divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. Perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake in adding an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That could be a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the example was structured that way to show how to extract assumptions, even if they are not explicit. But in reality, if the problem states \"for every integer n\", then the only assumption is that n is an integer. But the formatted problem in the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not part of the original problem. That seems like an error. Therefore, maybe the example is incorrect, and the user wants to extract only the assumptions explicitly stated or necessary for the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking about the roots of Hermite polynomials. The problem is to prove all roots are real. The Hermite polynomials as defined here are for degree n, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- H_n(x) is the Hermite polynomial of degree n defined as (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²}.\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify n; however, Hermite polynomials are defined for n ≥ 0. Therefore, those are the implicit assumptions. The problem is to prove that all roots of H_n(x) are real. So, structuring this according to the format:\n\nAssumption: Each line should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n(x) is defined as (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/ddx^n e^{-x²},\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that all the roots of the Hermite polynomial H_n(x) are real.\n\nBut I need to check if there are more assumptions. For example, is H_n(x) considered over the real numbers? Yes, since we're talking about real roots. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n(x) is a polynomial in real coefficients,\nH_n(x) is defined as (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²},\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the problem statement might already imply that H_n(x) is a polynomial with real coefficients. Since Hermite polynomials are known to have real coefficients, but the question is about the roots being real. So perhaps the first assumption is redundant. However, to adhere to the format, each assumption is one property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only necessary assumptions are the definition of H_n(x) and n being a non-negative integer. Because the question is about the roots being real, so the polynomial must be defined, and the coefficients are real. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n(x) is defined by H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²},\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that all roots of H_n(x) are real.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in the context of complex analysis, but the roots are real. But the standard Hermite polynomials have all real roots, so the key assumptions are the definition and n being a non-negative integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n(x) is defined as (-1)^n e^{x²} \\dfrac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²},\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that all the roots of the Hermite polynomial H_n(x) are real.\n\nThat should be it. Each assumption is on a separate line, each addressing one property. The first line defines H_n(x), the second specifies the domain of n. The problem is then to prove the roots are real.",
