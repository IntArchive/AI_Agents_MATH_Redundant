    "Content": "I was working out some problems. This is giving me trouble. If $p$ is a prime number of the form $4n+1$ then how do i show that: $$ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{p-1} \\Biggl( \\biggl\\lfloor{\\frac{2i^{2}}{p}\\biggr\\rfloor}-2\\biggl\\lfloor{\\frac{i^{2}}{p}\\biggr\\rfloor}\\Biggr)= \\frac{p-1}{2}$$ Two things which i know are: If $p$ is a prime of the form $4n+1$, then $x^{2} \\equiv -1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$ can be solved. $\\lfloor{2x\\rfloor}-2\\lfloor{x\\rfloor}$ is either $0$ or $1$. I think the second one will be of use, but i really can't see how i can apply it here.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then clearly state the problem. \n\nThe original problem is about proving a summation involving floor functions equals (p-1)/2, where p is a prime of the form 4n+1. Let me parse the information carefully.\n\nThe title states the summation formula, and the question body adds that p is a prime of the form 4n+1. The user also mentions two known facts: first, that if p is such a prime, then x² ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, and second, that the expression ⌊2x⌋ - 2⌊x⌋ is either 0 or 1. \n\nSo, the key assumptions here are about the prime p. Specifically, p must be a prime number, and it must be expressible in the form 4n+1. These are two separate conditions on p. Also, the summation runs from i=1 to p-1. \n\nI need to list each assumption line by line. The first assumption is that p is a prime number. The second is that p is of the form 4n+1. The third might be that i ranges from 1 to p-1, but the problem statement already includes that in the summation limits. Wait, the problem statement includes \"for i=1 to p-1\", so maybe that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The assumptions are the conditions on p.\n\nWait, the problem's original statement says \"if p is a prime number of the form 4n+1 then show that...\" So the assumptions are that p is prime and p ≡1 mod 4. So each of these is a separate condition on p.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- p is a prime number,\n- p is of the form 4n + 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove the given summation equals (p-1)/2.\n\nThe example given by the user had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the two conditions on p should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: \np is a prime number,\np is of the form 4n + 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{p-1} \\Biggl( \\biggl\\lfloor{\\frac{2i^{2}}{p}\\biggr\\rfloor}-2\\biggl\\lfloor{\\frac{i^{2}}{p}\\biggr\\rfloor}\\Biggr)= \\frac{p-1}{2}. $$\n\nI need to check if there are other assumptions. The user mentions that they know ⌊2x⌋ - 2⌊x⌋ is either 0 or 1. That's a property they recall, but it's not an assumption of the problem itself. The problem's assumptions are solely about p. The summation's range is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the two assumptions are correct as listed.\n\nYes, that seems right. The problem is to prove the equality given that p is a prime of the form 4n+1. The other details like the summation index are part of the problem's statement, not assumptions. So the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem as stated.",
