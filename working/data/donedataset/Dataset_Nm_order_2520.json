    "Content": "I read from a book without proof the following theorem: Let $f(x)$ be a differentiable function, then $f(x)$ is strictly increasing if and only if $f'(x) \\geq 0$, and $f'(x) \\gt 0$ almost everywhere. Is it correct? I doubt, but I could neither prove it nor give a counter example.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A necessary and sufficient condition is that $f^\\prime\\ge0$ everywhere and $f^\\prime > 0$ on a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. The condition stated in the question is sufficient, but not necessary. Consider the following differentiable and strictly increasing function for which $f^\\prime > 0$ does not hold almost everywhere. Let $C$ be the fat Cantor set (which is closed with positive measure, but does not contain any nontrivial open intervals). Let $g(x)$ be the distance from any point $x$ to $C$. Then, $g$ is continuous and vanishes precisely on $C$. The integral\n$$\nf(x)=\\int_0^xg(y)\\,dy\n$$\nis strictly increasing and continuously differentiable, but $f^\\prime=0$ on $C$. We can show that $f^\\prime\\ge0$ everywhere and $f^\\prime > 0$ on a dense set is indeed necessary and sufficient for $f$ to be strictly increasing (see also  Olivier Bégassat's comments to the question). Sufficiency : If $f^\\prime\\ge0$ then the mean value theorem implies that $f$ is increasing. If it was not strictly increasing then we would have $f(a)=f(b)$ for some $a < b$ implying that $f^\\prime=0$ on $[a,b]$, contradicting the condition that $f^\\prime > 0$ on a dense set. This proves sufficiency of the conditions. Necessity : In the other direction, suppose that $f$ is strictly increasing. Then, $f^\\prime\\ge0$ follows directly from the definition of the derivative. Also, $f(a) < f(b)$ for any $a < b$. The mean value theorem implies that $f^\\prime(x) > 0$ for some $x\\in[a,b]$. So, $f^\\prime > 0$ on a dense set.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: the title is about sufficient and necessary conditions for strictly monotone differentiable functions. The question mentions a theorem from a book stating that a differentiable function f(x) is strictly increasing if and only if two conditions hold: f'(x) ≥ 0 everywhere, and f'(x) > 0 almost everywhere. The user is doubting this theorem and is asking for verification, a proof, or a counterexample.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The theorem applies to a differentiable function f(x). The conditions given are two-fold: f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x, and f'(x) > 0 almost everywhere. The problem is to determine if this theorem is correct, i.e., whether these two conditions together are equivalent to f being strictly increasing.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The function f is differentiable. This is a key assumption because differentiability is required to talk about f'.\n2. The derivative f'(x) is greater than or equal to zero everywhere. This is the first condition given in the theorem.\n3. The derivative f'(x) is greater than zero almost everywhere. The term \"almost everywhere\" in mathematics typically means except on a set of measure zero. So this is the second condition.\n\nEach of these should be separate assumptions. Then, the problem is to prove or disprove that these conditions are equivalent to f being strictly increasing.\n\nWait, but the original theorem states the \"if and only if\". So the problem is to check whether the two conditions (f' ≥0 everywhere and f' >0 a.e.) are both necessary and sufficient for strict monotonicity. Therefore, the problem is to verify if the theorem as stated is correct.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the assumptions about f being differentiable, f' ≥0 everywhere, and f' >0 almost everywhere. The problem is whether these imply f is strictly increasing, and conversely, if f is strictly increasing, do these conditions hold.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user says the theorem claims that f is strictly increasing iff f' ≥0 and f' >0 almost everywhere. So the problem is to confirm if this theorem is correct. So the assumptions would be that f is differentiable, and the problem is to determine if the equivalence holds.\n\nBut the example given in the user's initial instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in this case, the assumptions are the conditions given in the theorem. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted the assumptions as n being an integer and n divisible by 7. But wait, in the original problem, the user stated \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the user might have made a mistake, but perhaps the example was structured that way to show how to filter. Wait, no. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal example: The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's contradictory. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\", that seems like an error. Maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps it's an example where the user added a condition. But regardless, the instruction now is to follow the example's structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the theorem states that for a differentiable function f, it's strictly increasing iff f' ≥0 everywhere and f' >0 almost everywhere. So the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\n1. f is differentiable.\n2. f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n3. f'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\n\nThen the problem is to determine if these conditions are equivalent to f being strictly increasing.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption (n is an integer) and then added another assumption (n divisible by 7). But the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, the current problem is about the theorem's conditions. The user is asking if the theorem is correct. The problem as stated in the theorem has two conditions: f' ≥0 everywhere and f' >0 a.e. So the formatted problem should list these as assumptions and the problem is to prove or disprove the equivalence.\n\nSo, in the Assumption section, each assumption should be a separate line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function,\nf'(x) ≥ 0 for all x,\nf'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that f is strictly increasing if and only if the above assumptions hold.\n\nWait, but the original problem's theorem is presented as \"f is strictly increasing iff f' ≥0 and f' >0 almost everywhere\". So the user is questioning whether this theorem is correct. Therefore, the problem is to determine if the theorem is correct, i.e., whether those two conditions on f' are equivalent to f being strictly increasing.\n\nHence, the problem statement would be: \"Determine whether the following theorem is correct: A differentiable function f is strictly increasing if and only if f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x and f'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\"\n\nBut following the example's structure, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that...\" or similar. However, the user's question is whether the theorem is correct. So perhaps the problem should be: \"Determine whether the theorem is correct: Let f(x) be a differentiable function. Then f(x) is strictly increasing if and only if f'(x) ≥ 0 and f'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\"\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the problem was to prove something under certain assumptions. So here, the problem is to prove or disprove the theorem. But how to structure it?\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have that condition. So perhaps the example is flawed, but the instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure as per the example.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem's theorem states that for a differentiable function, strict increasing is equivalent to f’≥0 everywhere and f’>0 a.e. The user is doubting this, so the formatted problem would list the assumptions (differentiable, f’≥0 everywhere, f’>0 a.e.) and then the problem is to prove or disprove the equivalence.\n\nBut the example had assumptions listed as separate lines, each for one property. So here, the three assumptions are:\n\n- f is a differentiable function.\n\n- f’(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\n- f’(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that f is strictly increasing if and only if the above assumptions hold.\n\nWait, but the original theorem says that f is strictly increasing iff those two conditions (f’≥0 and f’>0 a.e.). So the problem is to verify that equivalence.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the formatted problem includes the assumptions, but in that example, perhaps the original problem had an extra condition. So in our case, the problem is to prove that given the three assumptions (differentiable, f’≥0 everywhere, f’>0 a.e.), f is strictly increasing. But that's not exactly the case. The theorem is an equivalence, so the problem is to show that f is strictly increasing if and only if those two derivative conditions hold.\n\nBut the \"if and only if\" means we need both directions. So the problem is to prove the equivalence between strict monotonicity and the two derivative conditions.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would list the assumptions (differentiable, f’≥0 everywhere, f’>0 a.e.) and the problem is to prove the equivalence. But perhaps the \"if and only if\" is part of the problem statement, so the assumptions are the conditions given in the theorem's each direction.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Let $f(x)$ be a differentiable function, then $f(x)$ is strictly increasing if and only if $f'(x) \\geq 0$, and $f'(x) > 0$ almost everywhere. Is it correct?\"\n\nThe user is asking whether this theorem is correct. So the theorem claims that for a differentiable function f, f is strictly increasing iff (f’ ≥0 everywhere and f’ >0 a.e.).\n\nSo the problem is: Given a differentiable function f, prove or disprove that f is strictly increasing if and only if f’(x) ≥0 for all x and f’(x) >0 almost everywhere.\n\nSo in terms of the format:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function,\nf'(x) ≥ 0 for all x,\nf'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that f is strictly increasing if and only if the above assumptions hold.\n\nBut wait, the \"if and only if\" implies two directions:\n\n1. If f is strictly increasing, then f’ ≥0 everywhere and f’ >0 a.e.\n\n2. If f’ ≥0 everywhere and f’ >0 a.e., then f is strictly increasing.\n\nSo the assumptions for each direction might differ. However, in the theorem, the conditions are presented as a conjunction for the equivalence. So in the problem statement, the user wants to know if the equivalence holds, i.e., both directions under the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem are that f is differentiable, and then the problem is to check the equivalence between strict monotonicity and the two derivative conditions. So perhaps the assumptions should be split accordingly.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the example was trying to show that sometimes additional constraints are needed. However, in our current problem, the original theorem doesn't add extra constraints beyond differentiability. So the assumptions are:\n\n- f is differentiable.\n\nBut the theorem's conditions are f’ ≥0 everywhere and f’ >0 a.e. So perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: f is a differentiable function.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that f is strictly increasing if and only if f’(x) ≥0 for all x and f’(x) >0 almost everywhere.\n\nBut according to the user's format example, the assumptions include the conditions given in the problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption included n being an integer and n divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless there was a miscommunication. But perhaps in the example, the user intended to structure the problem with the necessary assumptions. However, given that, perhaps in our current problem, the assumptions are the properties that f is differentiable, and the problem is to establish the equivalence with the two derivative conditions.\n\nBut the original theorem says \"if and only if\", so the problem is about the equivalence. Therefore, the assumptions are that f is differentiable, and the problem is to prove that f is strictly increasing if and only if f’≥0 everywhere and f’>0 a.e.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that f is strictly increasing if and only if $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$ and $f'(x) > 0$ almost everywhere.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions list all the conditions applied to the objects. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7. That suggests perhaps the example was wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user in the example made a mistake. Given that, I should follow the instruction to list all the assumptions in the problem, which in this case, the theorem states two conditions (f’≥0 and f’>0 a.e.) as part of the equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions should list f being differentiable, and then the two conditions.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the \"if and only if\" means we have to consider both directions. So in one direction, if f is strictly increasing, then the two conditions hold. In the other direction, if the two conditions hold, then f is strictly increasing. Therefore, the assumptions for each direction are different.\n\nBut according to the user's format, we need to list all assumptions of the problem. The original problem's theorem is presented as a biconditional with two conditions. So when proving the \"if\" direction, the assumptions are that f is differentiable, f’≥0 everywhere, and f’>0 a.e., and the conclusion is that f is strictly increasing. For the \"only if\" direction, the assumption is that f is differentiable and strictly increasing, and the conclusion is that f’≥0 everywhere and f’>0 a.e.\n\nBut according to the user's example, perhaps we need to split all assumptions, even if they are part of the biconditional. This is a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's format expects all the conditions mentioned in the theorem to be listed as assumptions, and the problem is to prove the conclusion under those assumptions. But since it's an equivalence, maybe we need to structure it as two separate problems. However, the example given doesn't do that; it includes both conditions in the assumptions and the problem is to prove divisibility.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example's approach where the original problem had a universal quantifier (\"for every integer n\") but the formatted problem added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect, but perhaps the user intended that. So in our current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function,\nf'(x) ≥ 0 for all x,\nf'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is strictly increasing.\n\nBut that would only be the \"if\" direction. The original theorem is an \"if and only if\", so the problem should address both directions. However, the example only addressed one direction (the original problem was to prove divisibility under certain assumptions). So perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions would include differentiability, and the problem is the biconditional statement.\n\nBut I think the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is strictly increasing if and only if $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$ and $f'(x) > 0$ almost everywhere.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed as separate conditions. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem included n being an integer and n divisible by 7. If we follow that, even if the original problem's theorem includes multiple conditions, they should be listed as separate assumptions. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is differentiable.\n\n- f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\n- f'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is strictly increasing.\n\nBut this only addresses one direction of the equivalence. The original theorem is an equivalence, so the problem should be to prove both directions. However, the user's example only required one direction (since the original problem was to prove divisibility, which is a one-directional statement). Therefore, perhaps the user's format expects the problem to be phrased as proving the biconditional under the listed assumptions. But that might not fit neatly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to verify the theorem, which is an equivalence. Therefore, the problem statement should be: \"Prove or disprove: Let f be a differentiable function. Then f is strictly increasing if and only if f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x and f'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\" In this case, the assumptions are that f is differentiable, and the problem is the equivalence.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions should list all the conditions. Since the theorem has two parts (the \"if\" and \"only if\"), maybe the assumptions are different for each part. However, the user's example didn't split them; it listed all conditions as assumptions. Given that, perhaps in this case, the problem should list differentiability as the assumption, and then the problem is the equivalence between strict monotonicity and the two derivative conditions.\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the example where the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems like a mistake, perhaps in this case, the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function,\nf'(x) ≥ 0 for all x,\nf'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is strictly increasing.\n\nBut this would only cover the \"if\" direction. The \"only if\" direction would require different assumptions. But the user's example didn't handle biconditionals. Given the confusion, I think the best approach is to list all the conditions mentioned in the theorem as assumptions, and the problem is to prove the conclusion. Since the theorem is an equivalence, the problem would naturally require proving both directions under the respective assumptions.\n\nHowever, the user's example seems to have added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. This suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem statement, even if they are part of the conclusion. But that might not make sense. For example, in the original problem, the theorem states \"if and only if f’≥0 and f’>0 a.e.\", so those are the two conditions. The differentiability is a precondition for the theorem. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is differentiable.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that f is strictly increasing iff f’≥0 everywhere and f’>0 a.e.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions should list all conditions. The example included both \"n is an integer\" (which was part of the original problem's universal quantifier) and \"n is divisible by 7\" (which seems to have been added, perhaps mistakenly). Given that confusion, I think the safest way is to list the differentiability as the main assumption, and then the problem is the equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, since the theorem is an equivalence, perhaps the assumptions should include differentiability and the two conditions (f’≥0 and f’>0 a.e.), and the problem is to prove strict monotonicity. But then the converse would not be covered. This is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to follow the structure of the example, even if the example was flawed. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption. So perhaps here, even though the original theorem is an equivalence, we need to list the assumptions as the conditions given in the theorem's right-hand side (f’≥0 and f’>0 a.e.), plus differentiability, and the problem is to prove strict monotonicity. Then, the converse would be another part.\n\nBut since the example only structures one problem, perhaps the user wants to present the problem as proving one direction under the given assumptions. However, the user's question is about the entire theorem's correctness. Therefore, the formatted problem should reflect the entire equivalence.\n\nGiven all that, I think the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that f is strictly increasing if and only if $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$ and $f'(x) > 0$ almost everywhere.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed line by line. Here, the differentiable function is one assumption, and the two derivative conditions are part of the problem's \"if and only if\" statement. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions should only list the differentiability, and the problem includes the equivalence with the two conditions.\n\nThis seems correct. Therefore, the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that f is strictly increasing if and only if $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$ and $f'(x) > 0$ almost everywhere.\n\nBut in the user's example, the assumptions included both the quantifier (n is an integer) and an additional condition (n divisible by 7). So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are differentiability and the two conditions on f’, and the problem is to prove strict monotonicity. But that would only be the \"if\" direction. The \"only if\" direction would require different assumptions.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let me try to adhere to the example's structure as best as possible. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumptions included n being an integer and n divisible by 7. This suggests that the formatted problem's assumptions may include both the general condition (integer) and a specific one (divisible by 7), even if the original problem's statement didn't mention the latter. This implies that perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but following it, in our current problem, the assumptions would include the differentiable function and the two conditions on f', and the problem is to prove strict monotonicity.\n\nBut the original problem's theorem is an equivalence, so the formatted problem would need to address both directions. However, given the example's structure, which seems to focus on one direction (adding an extra assumption), perhaps in this case, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as differentiability and the two conditions, and the problem is to prove strict monotonicity (the \"if\" direction), while the \"only if\" direction would have different assumptions (differentiable and strictly increasing), and the problem would be to prove the two conditions on f’.\n\nBut the user's question is about the entire theorem, so maybe the formatted problem should capture the entire equivalence. However, the example provided doesn't handle biconditionals. Given the time I've spent, I think the most accurate way is:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function,\nf'(x) ≥ 0 for all x,\nf'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is strictly increasing.\n\nThis covers the \"if\" direction. Then, the converse would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function,\nf is strictly increasing.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x and f'(x) > 0 almost everywhere.\n\nBut the user's question is about the entire theorem, so perhaps the formatted problem should include both directions. However, the example's format doesn't show handling two problems. Therefore, perhaps the user's format expects a single problem statement with all relevant assumptions. Given that, and considering the original theorem is an equivalence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that f is strictly increasing if and only if $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$ and $f'(x) > 0$ almost everywhere.\n\nThis way, the only assumption is that f is differentiable, and the problem is to verify the equivalence. This seems correct and aligns with the example's structure, where the assumption is the general condition (n is an integer), and the problem is to prove the statement under that assumption plus additional ones (n divisible by 7), but in our case, the additional conditions are part of the biconditional.",
