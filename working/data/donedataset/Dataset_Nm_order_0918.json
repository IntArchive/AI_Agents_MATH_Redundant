    "Content": "In Euclid's infinite prime numbers proof, the logic is as follows: Assume a set $S$ of all prime numbers in existence is finite (there are a finite amount of primes) Then there must be a greatest prime $p$ $$n = (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5\\cdots p) + 1$$ $n > p$, and under the proof's assumption, $n$ cannot be prime.* This is where the logic confuses me. Why is it that given that the if a number is not prime, then it is automatically divisible by a prime. I can't think of an example to contradict, but that's not proof that there exists no number that is not prime and non divisible by primes.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One can prove this for all integers greater than $1$ by induction : we know that $2$ is a prime. Now for our inductive step assume that for all $i<n$ , $i$ is either prime or divisible by a prime. Case 1: $n$ is prime; we're done. Case 2: $n$ is composite, so $ab = n$ for $a, b < n$ . So each of those is divisible by a prime. We're done. Essentially the same argument shows that all integers greater than $1$ can be written as a product of primes.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about why non-prime numbers must be divisible by a prime number, referencing Euclid's proof of infinite primes. The user is confused about the step where if a number isn't prime, it must be divisible by a prime. They want an example or a contradiction, but they're not sure.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem from the original question. The original problem is in the title: \"Why are all non-prime numbers divisible by a prime number?\" The context given is from Euclid's proof where they assume a finite set of primes, create a number n as the product of all primes plus one, and then conclude n must be divisible by some prime not in the set. The user is stuck on why a composite number (non-prime) must have a prime divisor.\n\nSo, the main problem is to explain why any non-prime number is divisible by a prime. The assumptions here would relate to the properties of prime and composite numbers. Let me list the assumptions step by step.\n\nAssumptions could include:\n1. Considering a non-prime number (i.e., a composite number).\n2. The definition of composite numbers: numbers greater than 1 that are not prime.\n3. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factored into primes.\n4. In the context of Euclid's proof, the number n constructed is greater than 1, so it must be either prime or composite.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, maybe the assumptions are more about the given context in the question. The user mentions Euclid's proof where they assume a finite set of primes, create n = (2*3*5*...*p) + 1, then since n isn't divisible by any primes in the set, but if n is composite, it should be divisible by some prime not in the set. The confusion is why composite numbers must have prime divisors.\n\nSo, the problem is the general statement: Why are all non-prime numbers divisible by a prime number?\n\nAssumptions needed for this problem would be based on the definitions. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nThe user says: \"Why is it that given that if a number is not prime, then it is automatically divisible by a prime. I can't think of an example to contradict, but that's not proof that there exists no number that is not prime and non-divisible by primes.\"\n\nSo the key assumption here is the definition of prime and composite numbers. The number in question is an integer greater than 1 (since primes are defined for integers greater than 1). So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The number in consideration is an integer greater than 1.\n2. The number is not a prime number.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that such a number is divisible by a prime number.\n\nWait, but maybe the original problem in the user's question is more about the step in Euclid's proof. However, the title is general. So the problem is the general case. Let me check the example given by the user.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving A(n) divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the user added that. Wait, but maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example: The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like the user made a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe that example is not correct. But perhaps the user intended to show how to extract assumptions. Hmm, but perhaps the example is part of the user's instruction, so I should follow their example structure.\n\nWait, maybe the example is showing that the user wants to list all the assumptions from the problem, but in that case, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, there is no mention of n being divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the user provided a faulty example, but I have to follow their format regardless.\n\nBut regardless, back to the current problem. The user's question is about why non-prime numbers are divisible by primes. The problem is to prove that any non-prime number is divisible by a prime. The assumptions here would be the properties that lead to that conclusion.\n\nSo, in the problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The number under consideration is an integer greater than 1.\n2. The number is not a prime.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that such a number is divisible by a prime number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is based on Euclid's proof. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"In Euclid's infinite prime numbers proof, the logic is as follows: Assume a set S of all prime numbers in existence is finite (there are a finite amount of primes). Then there must be a greatest prime p. Then n = (2*3*5*...*p) + 1. n > p, and under the proof's assumption, n cannot be prime. This is where the logic confuses me. Why is it that given that the if a number is not prime, then it is automatically divisible by a prime. I can't think of an example to contradict, but that's not proof that there exists no number that is not prime and non divisible by primes.\"\n\nSo in the context of Euclid's proof, the number n is constructed, which is greater than 1. Since n is not prime (as per the assumption that all primes are in set S, but n is not divisible by any of them), the user is confused why n must be divisible by a prime. So in the specific case of Euclid's proof, the problem is: why is n, which is composite, divisible by a prime not in S? But the general problem is the title: why all non-primes are divisible by primes.\n\nSo the problem statement here is the title: \"Why are all non-prime numbers divisible by a prime number?\" So we need to structure this as per the format.\n\nAssumptions would be:\n\n1. The number is an integer greater than 1.\n2. The number is not a prime.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number is divisible by a prime number.\n\nBut wait, the user might not have stated all assumptions. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be factored into primes, but that's the conclusion. However, in the problem, the assumption is that the number is composite, and we need to show it has a prime divisor.\n\nSo, in the format, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. In this case, the problem is general, not specific to Euclid's proof. So the assumptions are:\n\n- The number is an integer greater than 1.\n- The number is not a prime (i.e., composite).\n\nThe problem is to prove that this number is divisible by a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is an integer greater than 1,\nThe number is not a prime.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the number is divisible by a prime number.\n\nAlternatively, in the context of Euclid's proof, but the title is general.\n\nI think the key here is to filter the original question's title and the specific confusion. The problem is general, so the assumptions are the necessary conditions (number is integer >1, not prime), and the problem is to prove divisibility by a prime.\n\nYes, that seems correct.",
