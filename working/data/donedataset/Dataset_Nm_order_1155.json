    "Content": "Let $f$ be an isometry ( i.e a diffeomorphism which preserves the Riemannian metrics) between Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(N,h).$ One can argue that $f$ also preserves the induced metrics $d_1, d_2$ on $M, N$ from $g, h$ resp. that is, $d_1(x,y)=d_2(f(x),f(y))$ for $x,y \\in M.$ Then, it's easy to show that $f$ sends geodesics on $M$ to geodesics on $N,$ using the length minimizing property of geodesics and that $f$ is distance-preserving. My question, Is it possible to derive the result without using the distance-preserving property of isometries, by merely the definition? What I have found so far; Let $\\gamma : I \\to M$ be a geodesic on $M$, i.e. $\\frac{D}{dt}(\\frac{d\\gamma}{dt})=0,$ where $\\frac{D}{dt}$ is the covariant derivative and $ \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}:=d\\gamma(\\frac{d}{dt}).$ Let $t_0 \\in I,$ we have to show that $\\frac{D}{dt}(\\frac{d(f \\circ \\gamma)}{dt})=0$ at $t=t_0,$ or $\\frac{D}{dt}(df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0}))=0.$ We also know that $$ \\langle \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0},\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0}\\rangle_{\\gamma(t_0)}= \\langle df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0}), df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0})\\rangle_{f(\\gamma(t_0))}.$$ Since $\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0},\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0}\\rangle_{\\gamma(t_0)}=2 \\langle \\frac{D}{dt}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0}),\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0}\\rangle_{\\gamma(t_0)}=0,$ therefore $$\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0}), df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0})\\rangle_{f(\\gamma(t_0))}=$$ $$2\\langle \\frac{D}{dt}(df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0})), df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0})\\rangle _{f(\\gamma(t_0))}=0.$$ How can I conclude from $\\langle\\frac{D}{dt}(df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0})), df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0}) \\rangle _{f(\\gamma(t_0))}=0$ that $\\frac{D}{dt}(df_{\\gamma(t_0)}(\\frac{d \\gamma}{dt}|_{t=t_0}))=0?$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem. The user is asking whether we can show that isometries preserve geodesics without using the distance-preserving property, just using the definition. The original approach used the length minimizing property, which relies on the distance being preserved. But here, they want to do it more directly via the covariant derivative.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions. An isometry is a diffeomorphism that preserves the Riemannian metric. That means, for any vectors u, v in the tangent space at a point p in M, the inner product before and after applying the differential of f is the same. So, ⟨u, v⟩_g = ⟨df_p(u), df_p(v)⟩_h. \n\nNow, a geodesic is a curve whose acceleration (covariant derivative of velocity) is zero. The user's approach starts with a geodesic γ in M, so D/dt (dγ/dt) = 0. They want to show that f∘γ is a geodesic in N, i.e., D/dt (d(f∘γ)/dt) = 0 in N. \n\nThey compute the derivative of the inner product of the velocity of f∘γ. Since γ is a geodesic, the derivative of its velocity's inner product is zero. Because f is an isometry, the inner product of df(velocity) is the same, so its derivative is also zero. This leads to an equation where the inner product of the covariant derivative of df(velocity) with df(velocity) is zero. \n\nBut how do we go from that inner product being zero to the whole covariant derivative being zero? Well, if the inner product of a vector with itself is zero, then the vector must be zero. Wait, but here it's the inner product of the covariant derivative (let's call it X) with the velocity vector (let's call it V). We have ⟨X, V⟩ = 0. But does that imply X = 0?\n\nIn general, if a vector is orthogonal to a non-zero vector, it doesn't have to be zero. However, in the case of geodesics, the acceleration (covariant derivative of velocity) is not only orthogonal but also satisfies specific properties. Wait, but here we are dealing with the image under f. Let me think.\n\nSince γ is a geodesic, D/dt (dγ/dt) = 0. The pushforward df(dγ/dt) is the velocity of f∘γ. The covariant derivative of this pushforward velocity is supposed to be zero. The calculation shows that the derivative of the norm squared of df(dγ/dt) is zero, which it already is because f preserves the metric. Then, taking the derivative of that, we get that the inner product of the covariant derivative of df(dγ/dt) with itself is zero. Wait, no. Wait, let me re-examine the equations.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the user wrote:\n\nThey start with the fact that the derivative of ⟨dγ/dt, dγ/dt⟩ is zero because the covariant derivative of dγ/dt is zero (since γ is a geodesic). Then, because f is an isometry, ⟨df(dγ/dt), df(dγ/dt)⟩ is also constant. So, taking the derivative of that, they get 2⟨D/dt (df(dγ/dt)), df(dγ/dt)⟩ = 0. Therefore, the inner product of the covariant derivative (D/dt) of df(dγ/dt) with df(dγ/dt) is zero. But this doesn't immediately imply that D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) is zero, unless we can show that this inner product being zero for all t implies the vector is zero.\n\nBut in general, if a vector X satisfies ⟨X, V⟩ = 0 for a particular V, X could be non-zero. However, in this case, if we have that ⟨D/dt (df(dγ/dt)), df(dγ/dt)⟩ = 0, and we know that df(dγ/dt) is the velocity of the curve f∘γ. If the covariant derivative of the velocity is orthogonal to the velocity, does that imply it's zero?\n\nWait, in Riemannian geometry, the geodesic equation is D/dt (dγ/dt) = 0. If a curve has D/dt (V) orthogonal to V everywhere, where V is the velocity, does that make it a geodesic? Not necessarily. For example, consider a curve parameterized by arc length but with acceleration orthogonal to velocity. On a sphere, a great circle has zero acceleration. If you have a curve with acceleration orthogonal to velocity, but not zero, it's not a geodesic. So just having the covariant derivative of the velocity orthogonal to velocity is not sufficient to conclude that the acceleration is zero.\n\nBut in this problem, we need to show that the acceleration is zero. So how can we bridge this gap? The user's calculation leads to ⟨D/dt (df(dγ/dt)), df(dγ/dt)⟩ = 0, but how does this imply D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) = 0?\n\nWait, maybe we need to use the fact that f preserves not just the metric but also the connection? Because isometries preserve the Levi-Civita connection. Wait, is that true? Yes, isometries preserve the Levi-Civita connection. Because the Levi-Civita connection is determined by the metric, so an isometry should preserve it. Therefore, the covariant derivative on N is the pushforward of the covariant derivative on M. Let me recall the property: if f is an isometry, then for any vector fields X, Y on M, we have df(∇_X Y) = ∇'_df(X) df(Y), where ∇ is the connection on M and ∇' is the connection on N.\n\nTherefore, since γ is a geodesic on M, ∇_{dγ/dt} dγ/dt = 0. Applying df to both sides, we get ∇'_{df(dγ/dt)} df(dγ/dt) = 0. But df(dγ/dt) is the velocity of f∘γ, so ∇'_{d(f∘γ)/dt} (d(f∘γ)/dt) = 0. Therefore, f∘γ is a geodesic on N.\n\nWait, but this uses the fact that isometries preserve the Levi-Civita connection, which might not be using the distance-preserving property directly. However, the problem is to derive that f sends geodesics to geodesics without using the distance-preserving property. So, if we use the fact that isometries preserve the connection, then we can directly pushforward the geodesic equation. But does the preservation of the Levi-Civita connection follow directly from the definition of an isometry (preserving the metric), or does it rely on the distance-preserving property?\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection is uniquely determined by the metric and its symmetry (torsion-free) and compatibility with the metric. Since f is an isometry, it preserves the metric, so the pushforward connection should coincide with the Levi-Civita connection on N. Therefore, yes, isometries preserve the connection. Therefore, if ∇ is the connection on M, then ∇' (on N) is related by df(∇_X Y) = ∇'_{df(X)} df(Y). Therefore, if ∇_{dγ/dt} dγ/dt = 0, applying df gives ∇'_{d(f∘γ)/dt} d(f∘γ)/dt = 0. Therefore, f∘γ is a geodesic. \n\nBut does this approach count as not using the distance-preserving property? Because here, we are using that isometries preserve the connection, which is a consequence of preserving the metric. The distance-preserving property is a separate consequence. So if the user wants to avoid using the metric property (distance) and only use the local metric tensor preservation, then this approach works.\n\nAlternatively, the user's own approach tried to use the fact that the derivative of the inner product is zero and then tried to conclude the covariant derivative is zero. But they were stuck at ⟨D/dt (df(dγ/dt)), df(dγ/dt)⟩ = 0. To proceed, maybe we need to use parallel transport or another property.\n\nAlternatively, since f is an isometry, it preserves all the Riemannian structure, including the connection. Therefore, the covariant derivative of the pushforward of a vector field is the pushforward of the covariant derivative. Hence, if D/dt (dγ/dt) = 0, then pushing forward via f gives D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) = 0. Therefore, f∘γ is a geodesic.\n\nBut perhaps the user is not aware of this property, so the answer needs to explain that isometries preserve the Levi-Civita connection, hence the covariant derivative. Therefore, without invoking the distance-preserving property, we can directly use the connection preservation.\n\nAlternatively, if we don't use that property, perhaps we need to compute in coordinates. Let's say we choose coordinates around γ(t_0) and pushed forward coordinates around f(γ(t_0)). Since f is an isometry, the metric coefficients h_{ij} in N are the same as g_{ij} in M under the coordinate chart induced by f. Therefore, the Christoffel symbols would also be preserved. Then, the geodesic equation in N for f∘γ would be the same as in M for γ, hence satisfied.\n\nBut this is again using that the isometry preserves the connection, which might be considered part of the definition or a derived property.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to proceed with the user's computation. They have that ⟨ D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) , df(dγ/dt) ⟩ = 0. If we can show that D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) is proportional to df(dγ/dt), then being orthogonal would imply it's zero. Wait, but in general, the covariant derivative of the velocity could have components orthogonal and tangential. However, for a geodesic, the covariant derivative of the velocity is zero, but here we are dealing with the image under f.\n\nAlternatively, since f is an isometry, df commutes with the covariant derivative. Wait, but how? If we consider that the covariant derivative on N is the pushforward of the covariant derivative on M, then D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) = df(D/dt dγ/dt) = df(0) = 0. Therefore, this directly gives the result. So this is using the fact that isometries preserve the covariant derivative. Therefore, the answer is that since f preserves the Levi-Civita connection, the covariant derivative of the pushforward is the pushforward of the covariant derivative, hence zero.\n\nBut the problem is to show this without using the distance-preserving property. The key here is that preserving the metric implies preserving the connection, hence the result follows. Therefore, the user's approach can be completed by invoking the preservation of the connection, which is a consequence of f being an isometry (i.e., preserving the metric), not directly the distance.\n\nSo, to answer the user's question: Yes, by using the fact that isometries preserve the Levi-Civita connection, hence the covariant derivative, we can directly conclude that the pushforward of a geodesic is a geodesic. Therefore, the step where they are stuck can be resolved by noting that the inner product being zero and the connection being preserved implies the covariant derivative is zero.\n\nAlternatively, if they don't want to invoke the connection preservation, maybe they can use the fact that the derivative of the inner product is zero and combine it with the geodesic equation in M. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's think again. The user derived that ⟨ D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) , df(dγ/dt) ⟩ = 0. Suppose we can show that D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) is parallel to df(dγ/dt). If that's the case, then the inner product being zero would imply the vector is zero. However, in general, the acceleration can have a component tangential to the curve (for a non-affinely parameterized geodesic), but in our case, since γ is a geodesic, dγ/dt is parallel transported, so maybe f preserves this property.\n\nWait, but if f is an isometry, then df preserves parallel transport. Therefore, if dγ/dt is parallel transported along γ, then df(dγ/dt) is parallel transported along f∘γ. Hence, D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) = 0.\n\nThis again uses that isometries preserve parallel transport, which is a consequence of preserving the connection. So, maybe the key point is that isometries preserve the connection, hence preserving the geodesic equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that isometries preserve the Levi-Civita connection, so the covariant derivative of the pushed-forward velocity is the pushforward of the covariant derivative, which is zero. Hence, f∘γ is a geodesic.\n\nAlternatively, if we are to avoid using the connection preservation and stick to the user's approach, perhaps we need to use the fact that the only vector orthogonal to the velocity with respect to the metric is zero. But this is not true unless the vector is both orthogonal and... Hmm. Wait, the user has that the inner product of the covariant derivative and the velocity is zero. But in general, for any curve, not necessarily a geodesic, the covariant derivative of the velocity (acceleration) is orthogonal to the velocity only if the curve is parameterized with constant speed. Because the derivative of ⟨V, V⟩ is 2⟨D/dt V, V⟩. If the speed is constant, this derivative is zero, hence ⟨D/dt V, V⟩ = 0.\n\nBut in our case, since γ is a geodesic, it's constant speed, so ⟨dγ/dt, dγ/dt⟩ is constant. Therefore, ⟨D/dt (df(dγ/dt)), df(dγ/dt)⟩ = 0 because the speed of f∘γ is constant (since f preserves the metric). But how does this help us conclude that D/dt (df(dγ/dt)) = 0?\n\nWait, but the problem is that even if the acceleration is orthogonal to velocity, it doesn't have to be zero. However, in the case of a geodesic, the acceleration is zero. But here, we are dealing with the image curve f∘γ. We need to show that its acceleration is zero. The user's calculation shows that the acceleration is orthogonal to the velocity. But why can't it have a non-zero orthogonal component?\n\nAh, but if f is an isometry, then the entire geometric structure is preserved. So, if γ is a geodesic in M, then f∘γ should have all the properties of a geodesic in N, including zero acceleration. But this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, since the user started with the definition that a geodesic is a curve with zero covariant derivative of its velocity, and f preserves the covariant derivative (due to being an isometry), then it must map geodesics to geodesics.\n\nBut the question is how to make that precise without using distance preservation. The key link is that isometries preserve the Levi-Civita connection. Therefore, the answer should be that since isometries preserve the metric and the Levi-Civita connection, the covariant derivative commutes with the pushforward, hence the image of a geodesic is a geodesic.\n\nTherefore, the step where the user is stuck can be resolved by invoking the preservation of the connection by the isometry, leading directly to the conclusion that the covariant derivative is zero.",
