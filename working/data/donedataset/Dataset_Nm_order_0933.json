    "Content": "Let $p_1, p_2,...,p_n$ be real polynomials of $k$ variables $x_1,...,x_k$ and assume that \n$$p_1^2 + \\dots +p_n^2=x_1^2 + \\dots + x_k^2$$ Prove that $n \\geq k$. Out of so many questions that I have attempted, this is the first question that I have absolutely no idea how to start (I am ashamed of myself). Can anyone give some hint?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's see. To begin with, all polynomials must be linear (otherwise the square of the highest-degree term of the highest-degree polynomial has degree more than 2 and no chances to cancel out with anything). The rest is simple: for a linear polynomial, $p(\\vec x)=0$ is a hyperplane which has a normal vector. With $n<k$, $n$ vectors do not form a complete basis in a $k$-dimensional space, so there is a non-zero vector perpendicular to all of them (that is, belonging to all hyperplanes where $p_i(\\vec x)=0$). So for this vector $p_1(\\vec x)=\\dots=p_n(\\vec x)=0$, hence $p_1^2 + \\dots +p_n^2=0$, but $x_1^2 + \\dots + x_k^2>0$. With $n=k$ the solutions (besides the obvious $p_i=x_i$) are plenty; just take any orthonormal basis. For example, $({2\\over3}x-{1\\over3}y+{2\\over3}z,\\; {2\\over3}x+{2\\over3}y-{1\\over3}z,\\; -{1\\over3}x+{2\\over3}y+{2\\over3}z)$ would do in 3D.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem states: Let p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ be real polynomials of k variables x₁, ..., x_k. Assume that the sum of their squares equals the sum of the squares of the variables, i.e., p₁² + ... + pₙ² = x₁² + ... + x_k². We need to prove that n ≥ k.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem.\n\nAssumption 1: Each p_i is a real polynomial. So, \"p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials.\"\n\nAssumption 2: These polynomials are in k variables x₁, ..., x_k. So, \"Each p_i is a polynomial in variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k.\"\n\nWait, maybe combining these two: \"p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials in k variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k.\" But the format requires each assumption to address only one property or condition for one object. Hmm. Let me check the example given.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were: \"$n$ is an integer,\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So each assumption is a separate line, each about one condition.\n\nTherefore, here:\n\nAssumption 1: p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials. (Each p_i is a real polynomial.)\n\nAssumption 2: Each p_i is a polynomial in variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k. (So the variables they depend on.)\n\nAssumption 3: The sum of the squares of the p_i's equals the sum of the squares of the variables. So, \"p₁² + p₂² + ... + pₙ² = x₁² + x₂² + ... + x_k².\"\n\nWait, but maybe the problem statement already combines these into one equation. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials in k variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k.\n- The equation p₁² + p₂² + ... + pₙ² = x₁² + x₂² + ... + x_k² holds.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe split into:\n\nAssumption 1: Each p_i is a real polynomial.\n\nAssumption 2: Each p_i is a polynomial in variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k.\n\nAssumption 3: The sum p₁² + p₂² + ... + pₙ² equals x₁² + x₂² + ... + x_k².\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the first line says \"Let p₁, p₂,...,p_n be real polynomials of k variables x₁,...,x_k\", which combines two properties: real polynomials and variables they are in. So should we split that into two separate assumptions? Or is it okay to have them as one?\n\nLooking back at the example: the first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer,\" second \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So each separate condition. Here, the problem states \"real polynomials of k variables,\" which is two properties: real and in k variables. So perhaps split into:\n\nAssumption 1: p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials.\n\nAssumption 2: Each p_i is a polynomial in variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k.\n\nAssumption 3: The sum of the squares of the p_i's equals the sum of the squares of the variables.\n\nBut maybe \"polynomials of k variables\" is one property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption 1: p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials in variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k.\n\nAssumption 2: The equation p₁² + p₂² + ... + pₙ² = x₁² + x₂² + ... + x_k² holds.\n\nBut according to the example's format, each assumption is a separate line, even if they are about the same object. For instance, in the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So two separate lines. Therefore, here, maybe the first assumption is about the nature of p_i (real polynomials), the second about the variables they depend on (k variables), and the third about the equation.\n\nWait, but the variables they depend on is part of the definition of the polynomials. So in the problem statement, \"Let p₁, p₂,...,p_n be real polynomials of k variables x₁,...,x_k\" is one assumption. However, according to the example, each separate condition is listed. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption 1: p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials.\n\nAssumption 2: Each p_i is a polynomial in variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k.\n\nAssumption 3: The sum p₁² + p₂² + ... + pₙ² equals x₁² + x₂² + ... + x_k².\n\nThat way, each assumption is one condition. Alternatively, maybe combining the first two into one assumption is acceptable. The example split the conditions on n into two separate lines. So if \"real polynomials\" is one condition, \"polynomials in k variables\" is another. So that's two separate assumptions. The third is the equation.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption: \n- p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials,\n- Each p_i is a polynomial in variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k,\n- The equation p₁² + p₂² + ... + pₙ² = x₁² + x₂² + ... + x_k² holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that n ≥ k.\n\nBut let's check if the example's assumption part had multiple conditions separated by commas. In the example:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nSo two separate lines. Therefore, here, the first two assumptions are separate.\n\nHence, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: \n- p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials,\n- Each p_i is a polynomial in variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k,\n- The equation p₁² + p₂² + ... + pₙ² = x₁² + x₂² + ... + x_k² holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that n ≥ k.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"Let p₁, p₂,...,p_n be real polynomials of k variables x₁,...,x_k\" which already combines the first two assumptions. However, following the example's structure, which splits conditions, even if they are part of the same sentence, into separate lines, we need to separate them.\n\nYes, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumption, it was split into \"$n$ is an integer\", which is one line, and then \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as another. So similar here, \"real polynomials\" and \"of k variables\" are two separate conditions, so they should be separate assumptions.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \np₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are real polynomials,\nEach p_i is a polynomial in variables x₁, x₂, ..., x_k,\nThe equation p₁² + p₂² + ... + pₙ² = x₁² + x₂² + ... + x_k² holds.\nProblem: Prove that n ≥ k.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
