    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by understanding the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about proving an identity related to Euler's work, connecting π/2 with an infinite product over prime numbers. The formula given is:\n\nπ/2 = product from k=2 to infinity of (1 + (-1)^((p_k - 1)/2)/p_k)^(-1)\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example provided lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem step by step.\n\nThe product starts at k=2, which probably means p_k is the k-th prime number, starting from k=1 as p₁=2. But here, the product starts at k=2, so p₂=3, p₃=5, etc. So the primes involved are starting from 3 onwards? Wait, but the product is from k=2, which would correspond to primes starting at p₂=3.\n\nBut let's check the problem statement again. The product is from k=2 to infinity, and the term inside is (1 + (-1)^{(p_k - 1)/2}/p_k)^{-1}. So each term in the product involves p_k, the k-th prime. So p_k is the k-th prime number. The first prime is 2 (k=1), then 3 (k=2), 5 (k=3), etc. So when k starts at 2, p_k starts at 3. Therefore, the product is over primes starting from 3.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions here are about the properties of p_k. Each p_k is a prime number, and the exponent (p_k - 1)/2 relates to whether p_k is congruent to 1 or 3 mod 4. Because (-1) raised to that exponent would be 1 if (p_k -1)/2 is even, which happens when p_k ≡ 1 mod 4, and -1 if (p_k -1)/2 is odd, which happens when p_k ≡ 3 mod 4. Because if p_k is 1 mod 4, then (p_k -1)/2 is even? Let's verify:\n\nTake p_k = 5 (which is 1 mod 4). (5 -1)/2 = 2, which is even, so (-1)^2 = 1.\n\nTake p_k = 3 (3 mod 4). (3 -1)/2 = 1, which is odd, so (-1)^1 = -1.\n\nSimilarly, p_k =7: (7-1)/2=3, which is odd, so (-1)^3=-1. But 7 is 3 mod 4. Wait, 7 mod 4 is 3. So primes congruent to 1 mod 4 give exponent even, leading to +1, and primes congruent to 3 mod 4 give exponent odd, leading to -1.\n\nTherefore, the term (-1)^{(p_k -1)/2} is equivalent to the Legendre symbol (-1/p_k), which relates to quadratic residues. But maybe that's part of the problem's context, but not necessarily an assumption. The problem is to prove the identity as given.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. p_k is the k-th prime number. Since the product starts at k=2, p_2=3, p_3=5, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem states the product starts at k=2, so perhaps p_k is defined for k >=2. But in standard notation, p_k is the k-th prime, starting at k=1 for p₁=2. So maybe the problem is using p_k as primes starting from k=2, i.e., primes greater than 2. But maybe that's an assumption to list.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might just be using p_k as primes in order, starting from 3. However, the key here is to list all explicit assumptions from the problem statement. The original problem says:\n\n\"Prove that π/2 equals the product from k=2 to infinity of (1 + (-1)^{(p_k -1)/2}/p_k)^{-1}\"\n\nSo the problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. p_k is the k-th prime number. (But since the product starts at k=2, this would be primes starting from the second prime, which is 3.)\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the product is from k=2 to infinity, and each term is (1 + (-1)^{(p_k -1)/2}/p_k)^{-1}. The primes here are p_k, starting from k=2, so p_2=3, p_3=5, etc.\n\nBut the problem might not explicitly state that p_k is the k-th prime. However, in the title, the user mentions \"an identity of Euler's\" and the product involves primes. So it's safe to assume that p_k denotes the k-th prime number. Therefore, the assumptions would include that p_k is the k-th prime number for k >=2.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate condition.\n\nIn this case, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- For each integer k >=2, p_k is the k-th prime number.\n\nBut maybe more precisely:\n\n1. p_k is the k-th prime number for each integer k >=2.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state any other conditions. The exponent (p_k -1)/2 is computed for each prime p_k. The term (-1)^{(p_k -1)/2} alternates based on whether p_k is congruent to 1 or 3 mod 4, but that's inherent to the primes, not an assumption. The problem is to prove the identity as given, so the main assumption is about the structure of the product over primes starting from k=2 (i.e., primes >=3).\n\nWait, but perhaps another assumption is that the product converges. But maybe that's part of the problem to prove. Alternatively, the problem assumes convergence. But in the example given, the assumption was only about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the key assumption is that p_k is the sequence of primes starting from the second prime (3,5,7,...). So the formatted problem should list assumptions line by line.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n1. For each integer k ≥ 2, p_k is the k-th prime number.\n\nBut wait, the product starts at k=2, which corresponds to p_2=3. So perhaps it's better to state:\n\n1. p_k denotes the k-th prime number.\n\nBut then the product starts at k=2, so p_k for k ≥2. The problem statement includes the product from k=2 to infinity, so the index starts at 2. So maybe the assumption is that the product is taken over primes starting from p_2=3. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state that p_k is the k-th prime; it's inferred from the context. So as a knowledgeable professor, I need to make that explicit.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- p_k is the k-th prime number.\n\nBut since the product starts at k=2, the primes involved are p_2, p_3, etc., which are 3,5,7,11,...\n\nBut perhaps the problem has another implicit assumption related to the convergence of the infinite product. However, in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the user might have included that. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which seems like a mistake. Wait, let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not in the original problem. That might be a mistake in the example. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, but the instruction is to follow the format, which in the example includes possibly incorrect assumptions. However, the user might have intended that the assistant should extract explicit assumptions from the problem, even if the example is wrong.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example. So the original problem in the example had an assumption added that wasn't in the original, which might be an error. So perhaps the instruction is to list all necessary assumptions, even those implicit in the problem. For instance, in the example, maybe the problem requires that n is divisible by 7 for the divisibility by 91 (since 91=13*7), but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the current task is to follow the format, which may involve extracting assumptions even if they are not explicitly stated.\n\nBut in the current problem about Euler's identity, the problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the product over primes starting at k=2. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. p_k is the k-th prime number.\n\nBut maybe another assumption is that the product is taken over primes starting from p_2=3.\n\nAlternatively, since the product starts at k=2, and primes are indexed starting from k=1 (p₁=2), then k=2 corresponds to p₂=3. So the product is over primes ≥3.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. p_k denotes the k-th prime number for k ≥ 2.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately:\n\n1. For each integer k ≥ 2, p_k is the k-th prime number.\n\nAlternatively, since primes start at p₁=2, then k=2 is p₂=3, etc. So the product is over primes starting from p₂=3.\n\nBut maybe the problem assumes that the product is over odd primes (excluding 2). That's plausible because 2 is the only even prime, and the term (-1)^{(p_k -1)/2} would be (-1)^{(2-1)/2} = (-1)^{0.5} which is not an integer. But since the product starts at k=2 (p₂=3), we avoid p=2. So that's an important assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The product is taken over primes p_k starting from k=2 (i.e., primes greater than 2).\n\n2. For each prime p_k in the product, the exponent (p_k -1)/2 is an integer.\n\nWait, but (p_k -1)/2 is an integer only if p_k is odd, which it is since primes after 2 are odd. So since p_k ≥3, which is odd, (p_k -1) is even, so (p_k -1)/2 is an integer. Therefore, the exponent is valid.\n\nBut since the problem starts the product at k=2, which corresponds to primes starting at 3, this is already covered. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The product is over primes p_k where k starts at 2 (i.e., primes greater than 2).\n\nBut how to phrase this in the assumption list?\n\nEach assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n1. p_k is the k-th prime number for each integer k ≥ 2.\n\n2. The product is taken over k from 2 to infinity.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states the product is from k=2 to infinity, that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. But according to the example, the assumptions are about the conditions of the objects involved. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", that's considered an assumption. Therefore, in this case, the product being from k=2 to infinity is part of the problem statement, but the assumption is that p_k is the k-th prime number for each k ≥2.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps an assumption is that the primes are ordered increasingly, but that's standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. Let me look at the original problem again:\n\nTitle: Proving an identity of Euler's relating π/2 to a product over primes.\n\nProblem: Prove that π/2 equals the product from k=2 to infinity of (1 + (-1)^{(p_k -1)/2}/p_k)^{-1}.\n\nThe user is asking how to prove this identity. The key elements are:\n\n- The product starts at k=2.\n\n- p_k is the k-th prime.\n\n- The term involves (-1) raised to (p_k -1)/2.\n\nSo the assumptions needed are:\n\n1. For each integer k ≥2, p_k denotes the k-th prime number.\n\n2. The product is taken over k starting at 2 to infinity.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the properties of n (being an integer, divisible by 7). Similarly, here, the assumptions would be about the properties of p_k and the indices.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For each integer k ≥2, p_k is the k-th prime number.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $$\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\prod_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\left(1+\\dfrac{(-1)^{\\dfrac{p_{k}-1}{2}}}{p_{k}} \\right )^{-1}.$$\n\nBut wait, the example had each assumption on a separate line. So if there's only one assumption, that's okay. However, perhaps there are two assumptions here:\n\n1. For each integer k ≥2, p_k is the k-th prime number.\n\n2. The exponent (p_k -1)/2 is an integer for each k ≥2.\n\nBut the second is a consequence of p_k being an odd prime (since for k ≥2, p_k ≥3 and odd), so (p_k -1) is even, hence (p_k -1)/2 is an integer. Therefore, this is already implied by the first assumption. Hence, no need to state separately.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not require any assumptions beyond the product starting at k=2 and p_k being the k-th prime. So the formatted problem would have one assumption line stating that p_k is the k-th prime for k ≥2.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For each integer k ≥2, p_k is the k-th prime number.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $$\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\prod_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\left(1+\\dfrac{(-1)^{\\dfrac{p_{k}-1}{2}}}{p_{k}} \\right )^{-1}.$$\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was formatted as an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then there was an added assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, and perhaps the user intended to include all conditions mentioned in the problem. But in this current problem, the only condition is the product over k≥2 with p_k as primes. Therefore, the assumption is that p_k is the k-th prime for k≥2.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should be as above.",
