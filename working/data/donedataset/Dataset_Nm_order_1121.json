    "AcceptedAnswer": "Just so this question is fully answered (i.e. getting the bound $8/3$ ) here I add a condensed proof of $x_n^2 \\leq \\frac{8}{3}$ from the answer given here as Community Wiki. Define $$E_n = (x_n - x_{n-1})^2 + F_n\\left(x_n + x_{n-1}\\right)^2$$ with $F_n = \\frac{(n-1)}{3n+1}$ . The recurrence relation gives us $$E_{n+1} - E_n = \\frac{(F_{n+1}-F_n)}{F_n}\\cdot F_n\\left(x_n + x_{n+1}\\right)^2 \\geq 0$$ since $F_n$ is a positive and increasing function. This shows that $E_n$ is increasing. We also see that $$E_{n+1} - E_n \\leq \\frac{(F_{n+1}-F_n)}{F_n}\\cdot E_n \\implies \\frac{E_{n+1}}{F_{n+1}} \\leq \\frac{E_n}{F_n}$$ so $\\frac{E_n}{F_n}$ is decreasing and since $F_n$ converges it follows that $E_n$ converges. To bound $x_n$ from $E_n$ note that the definition of $E_n$ (the equation for an ellipse) allows us to write $x_n - x_{n-1} = \\sqrt{E_n}\\cos(\\phi_n)$ and $x_n + x_{n-1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_n}{F_n}}\\sin(\\phi_n)$ for some angle $\\phi_n$ . Thus $$x_n^2 = \\frac{E_n}{4}[\\cos(\\phi_n) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{F_n}}\\sin(\\phi_n)]^2$$ Maximizing the right hand side over $\\phi_n$ gives us $$x_n^2 \\leq \\frac{E_n}{4}\\left[1 + \\frac{1}{F_n}\\right] = E_n\\cdot \\frac{n}{n-1}$$ Since $\\frac{E_n}{F_n}$ is decreasing we have $E_n \\leq F_n \\frac{E_2}{F_2} = 8F_n$ and $$x_n^2 \\leq \\frac{8n}{3n+1} \\leq \\frac{8}{3}$$ It is possible to improve the constant with a bit of numerical computation (using $n=5$ instead of $n=2$ when bounding $E_n$ ) to the best possible one $\\frac{9}{4}$ (for which we have equality for $n=3$ ). The best possible asymptotic bound would be slightly smaller than $2$ (best possible in the sense that $x_n^2 \\approx 2$ would occur infinitely many times).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the problem is about a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, and we need to show that the square of each term is less than or equal to 8/3. Let me start by understanding the given information and then figure out a strategy.\n\nFirst, the sequence {x_n} is defined with x₁ = 0 and x₂ = 1. Then, for n ≥ 2, each subsequent term is given by x_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}. The goal is to prove that x_n² ≤ 8/3 for all n. The user also mentioned that they transformed the recurrence relation into a different form involving sums, but I should check if that's correct or if there's another way to approach it.\n\nLet me first write down the recurrence relation again to make sure I have it right:\n\nx_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)x_n - x_{n-1} for n ≥ 2.\n\nGiven x₁ = 0 and x₂ = 1. They also mentioned that x₀ = -1, which might come into play if we need to compute terms before x₁, but let's see.\n\nThe first thing I might do is compute the first few terms of the sequence to see the pattern and check if the squares indeed stay below 8/3. Let's compute x₃, x₄, etc.\n\nStarting with x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1.\n\nFor n = 2: x₃ = (1 + 1/2)x₂ - x₁ = (3/2)(1) - 0 = 3/2. Then x₃² = (9/4) = 2.25, which is less than 8/3 ≈ 2.6667.\n\nFor n = 3: x₄ = (1 + 1/3)x₃ - x₂ = (4/3)(3/2) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. x₄² = 1, still below 8/3.\n\nn = 4: x₅ = (1 + 1/4)x₄ - x₃ = (5/4)(1) - 3/2 = 5/4 - 3/2 = 5/4 - 6/4 = -1/4. x₅² = 1/16 ≈ 0.0625.\n\nn = 5: x₆ = (1 + 1/5)x₅ - x₄ = (6/5)(-1/4) - 1 = (-6/20) - 1 = (-3/10) - 1 = -13/10. x₆² = 169/100 = 1.69, still below 8/3.\n\nn = 6: x₇ = (1 + 1/6)x₆ - x₅ = (7/6)(-13/10) - (-1/4) = (-91/60) + 1/4 = (-91/60 + 15/60) = (-76/60) = -19/15 ≈ -1.2667. x₇² ≈ (361/225) ≈ 1.604, still under 8/3.\n\nn = 7: x₈ = (1 + 1/7)x₇ - x₆ = (8/7)(-19/15) - (-13/10) = (-152/105) + 13/10 = (-152/105 + 136.5/105) = (-15.5/105) ≈ -0.1476. x₈² ≈ 0.0218.\n\nWait, this seems to be oscillating? The terms go from positive to negative and back, but their squares are fluctuating. But up to n=8, the squares are all below 8/3. Let's check a few more terms to see if maybe the maximum is around the beginning.\n\nn=8: x₉ = (1 + 1/8)x₈ - x₇ ≈ (9/8)(-0.1476) - (-1.2667) ≈ -0.166 + 1.2667 ≈ 1.1007. x₉² ≈ 1.2115.\n\nn=9: x₁₀ = (10/9)x₉ - x₈ ≈ (10/9)(1.1007) - (-0.1476) ≈ 1.223 + 0.1476 ≈ 1.3706. x₁₀² ≈ 1.878.\n\nn=10: x₁₁ = (11/10)x₁₀ - x₉ ≈ (11/10)(1.3706) - 1.1007 ≈ 1.5077 - 1.1007 ≈ 0.407. x₁₁² ≈ 0.1656.\n\nn=11: x₁₂ = (12/11)x₁₁ - x₁₀ ≈ (12/11)(0.407) - 1.3706 ≈ 0.444 - 1.3706 ≈ -0.9266. x₁₂² ≈ 0.858.\n\nn=12: x₁₃ = (13/12)x₁₂ - x₁₁ ≈ (13/12)(-0.9266) - 0.407 ≈ -1.004 + (-0.407) ≈ -1.411. x₁₃² ≈ 1.990, still under 8/3.\n\nn=13: x₁₄ = (14/13)x₁₃ - x₁₂ ≈ (14/13)(-1.411) - (-0.9266) ≈ -1.525 + 0.9266 ≈ -0.5984. x₁₄² ≈ 0.358.\n\nn=14: x₁₅ = (15/14)x₁₄ - x₁₃ ≈ (15/14)(-0.5984) - (-1.411) ≈ -0.6411 + 1.411 ≈ 0.7699. x₁₅² ≈ 0.592.\n\nHmm, so up to n=15, the maximum square is around x₃²=2.25 and x₁₃²≈1.99, both still below 8/3≈2.6667. Maybe the initial terms have higher squares. But the problem states to show that x_n² ≤8/3 for all n. The example in the problem statement mentions that maybe 8/3 isn't the best constant, but it's given as the bound to prove.\n\nNow, how to approach proving this. The user mentioned transforming the recurrence into x_{n+1} - x_n = (1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}, then summing from k=1 to n, leading to x_{n+1} - x_1 = sum_{k=1}^n x_k /k - sum_{k=1}^{n-1}x_k. Let me verify this transformation.\n\nStarting from the original recurrence:\n\nx_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}\n\nSubtract x_n from both sides:\n\nx_{n+1} - x_n = (1 + 1/n)x_n - x_{n-1} - x_n = (1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}\n\nSo yes, that gives x_{n+1} - x_n = (x_n)/n - x_{n-1}\n\nThen, summing from n=1 to N (but wait, original recurrence is for n ≥ 2, so maybe starting sum from n=2?)\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nx_{n+1} - x_n = (1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}\n\nThen they sum from k=1 to n:\n\nSum_{k=1}^n (x_{k+1} - x_k) = sum_{k=1}^n [ (x_k)/k - x_{k-1} ]\n\nBut the left side telescopes to x_{n+1} - x_1.\n\nOn the right side, we have sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) - sum_{k=1}^n x_{k-1}\n\nBut x_{k-1} when k=1 would be x_0, which is given as -1. So sum_{k=1}^n x_{k-1} = x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_{n-1} = (-1) + 0 + 1 + x_3 + ... +x_{n-1}\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user wrote:\n\nx_{n+1} -x_1 = sum_{k=1}^n x_k /k - sum_{k=1}^{n-1}x_k\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the indices here. Let me check.\n\nIf we sum from k=1 to n:\n\nLeft side: x_{n+1} - x_1.\n\nRight side: sum_{k=1}^n [x_k /k - x_{k-1}]\n\nWhich is sum_{k=1}^n x_k/k - sum_{k=1}^n x_{k-1}\n\nThe second sum is x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + ... +x_{n-1} = sum_{m=0}^{n-1} x_m (where m = k-1)\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nx_{n+1} - x_1 = sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) - sum_{m=0}^{n-1}x_m\n\nBut x_1 is 0, so x_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) - sum_{m=0}^{n-1}x_m\n\nBut x_0 = -1, so sum_{m=0}^{n-1}x_m = -1 + sum_{m=1}^{n-1}x_m\n\nTherefore:\n\nx_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) - (-1 + sum_{m=1}^{n-1}x_m )\n\n= sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) +1 - sum_{m=1}^{n-1}x_m\n\nWhich rearranges to:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) - sum_{m=1}^{n-1}x_m\n\nBut perhaps this can be simplified. Let's consider sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) as the sum of x_k/k from k=1 to n, and sum_{m=1}^{n-1}x_m as the sum of x_m from m=1 to n-1.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) - sum_{k=1}^{n-1}x_k\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe this expression can be manipulated further. Alternatively, perhaps we can look for a pattern or closed-form solution for x_n, but that might be challenging. Alternatively, perhaps we can use induction to prove the bound.\n\nAnother approach might be to consider the recurrence relation as a linear recurrence and solve it. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nx_{n+1} - (1 + 1/n)x_n + x_{n-1} = 0 for n ≥ 2.\n\nBut linear recurrences with variable coefficients (since 1/n changes with n) are generally more difficult to solve than those with constant coefficients. Perhaps there's a substitution that can simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can look for a generating function. Let me define G(x) = sum_{n=1}^∞ x_n x^n. Then, perhaps we can derive a differential equation for G(x). Let me attempt that.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence can be related to some known functions or has a pattern that allows us to express x_n in terms of harmonic numbers or similar sequences.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the recurrence relation again:\n\nx_{n+1} - x_n = (x_n)/n - x_{n-1}\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx_{n+1} = x_n + (x_n)/n - x_{n-1}\n\n= x_n (1 + 1/n) - x_{n-1}\n\nWhich is the original recurrence. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write this as:\n\nx_{n+1} + x_{n-1} = x_n (1 + 1/n)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. Let's check the terms again:\n\nx₁ = 0, x₂ = 1, x₃ = 3/2, x₄=1, x₅=-1/4, x₆=-13/10, x₇≈-19/15, x₈≈-0.1476, x₉≈1.1007, etc. The sequence seems to oscillate with decreasing amplitude? But not sure. The squares up to n=15 don't exceed 8/3, which is approximately 2.6667, and the maximum so far is x₃²=9/4=2.25.\n\nWait, but the problem wants to prove that all x_n² ≤8/3. So maybe the maximum occurs at some n, but how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use mathematical induction. Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose we want to show that x_n² ≤8/3 for all n ≥1.\n\nBase cases: n=1, x₁=0, 0²=0 ≤8/3. True.\n\nn=2, x₂=1, 1²=1 ≤8/3. True.\n\nn=3, x₃=3/2, (3/2)²=9/4=2.25 ≤8/3≈2.6667. True.\n\nn=4, x₄=1, same as n=2. True.\n\nn=5, x₅=-1/4, square is 1/16, which is small.\n\nSo the base cases up to n=5 hold. Now, suppose that for some k ≥2, x_{k}² ≤8/3 and x_{k-1}² ≤8/3. We need to show that x_{k+1}² ≤8/3.\n\nBut induction with this approach might not work directly because the recurrence involves both x_{k} and x_{k-1}, and their combination could potentially exceed the bound. Also, since the coefficients (1 + 1/k) change with k, it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for x_n. Let's attempt to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and second-order but with variable coefficients due to the (1 + 1/n) term. Solving such equations can be tricky. Maybe we can look for a pattern in the terms.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to compute more terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nContinuing from where I left off:\n\nn=15: x₁₅≈0.7699, so x₁₅²≈0.592.\n\nn=15: x₁₆ = (16/15)x₁₅ - x₁₄ ≈ (16/15)(0.7699) - (-0.5984) ≈ 0.8212 + 0.5984 ≈ 1.4196. x₁₆²≈2.016, still under 8/3.\n\nn=16: x₁₇ = (17/16)x₁₆ - x₁₅ ≈ (17/16)(1.4196) - 0.7699 ≈ 1.507 - 0.7699 ≈ 0.7371. x₁₇²≈0.543.\n\nn=17: x₁₈ = (18/17)x₁₇ - x₁₆ ≈ (18/17)(0.7371) - 1.4196 ≈ 0.778 - 1.4196 ≈ -0.6416. x₁₈²≈0.4117.\n\nn=18: x₁₉ = (19/18)x₁₈ - x₁₇ ≈ (19/18)(-0.6416) - 0.7371 ≈ -0.674 + (-0.7371) ≈ -1.4111. x₁₉²≈1.990, which is still under 8/3.\n\nn=19: x₂₀ = (20/19)x₁₉ - x₁₈ ≈ (20/19)(-1.4111) - (-0.6416) ≈ -1.485 + 0.6416 ≈ -0.8434. x₂₀²≈0.7115.\n\nn=20: x₂₁ = (21/20)x₂₀ - x₁₉ ≈ (21/20)(-0.8434) - (-1.4111) ≈ -0.8856 + 1.4111 ≈ 0.5255. x₂₁²≈0.276.\n\nHmm, interesting. The squares seem to oscillate but not exceeding 8/3. The maximum so far is still at n=3 with 9/4=2.25. However, when we computed x₁₆, we had x₁₆≈1.4196, so x₁₆²≈2.016, which is still under 8/3≈2.6667. Maybe the bound is safe. But how to prove it?\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe consider the energy of the sequence, like defining E_n = x_n² + something, and show that it's bounded. Alternatively, find a relation between x_{n+1} and x_n, x_{n-1} that allows us to bound x_{n+1} in terms of previous terms.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence is linear, maybe we can write it in matrix form and analyze the eigenvalues. However, since the coefficients are variable, this might not help directly.\n\nAnother approach: Let's assume that |x_n| ≤ sqrt(8/3) for all n up to k, and then try to show that |x_{k+1}| ≤ sqrt(8/3).\n\nGiven x_{k+1} = (1 + 1/k)x_k - x_{k-1}\n\nTaking absolute values:\n\n|x_{k+1}| ≤ |(1 + 1/k)x_k| + |x_{k-1}|.\n\nIf we assume |x_k| ≤ sqrt(8/3) and |x_{k-1}| ≤ sqrt(8/3), then:\n\n|x_{k+1}| ≤ (1 + 1/k)sqrt(8/3) + sqrt(8/3) = sqrt(8/3)(1 + 1/k + 1) = sqrt(8/3)(2 + 1/k).\n\nBut 2 + 1/k is greater than 2 for all k ≥1, so this would give |x_{k+1}| > 2*sqrt(8/3) ≈ 3.265, which is way larger than sqrt(8/3)≈1.632. This approach doesn't work because the triangle inequality gives a bound that's too loose.\n\nTherefore, induction using absolute values directly might not work. Instead, perhaps we need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother idea: Square both sides of the recurrence relation and use inequalities to bound x_{n+1}².\n\nLet me attempt that. Starting with:\n\nx_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nx_{n+1}² = [(1 + 1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}]^2 = (1 + 1/n)^2 x_n² - 2(1 + 1/n)x_n x_{n-1} + x_{n-1}².\n\nNow, if we can relate this to previous terms, perhaps we can find a recursive inequality. But this seems complicated because of the cross term -2(1 + 1/n)x_n x_{n-1}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality to bound this expression.\n\nAlternatively, consider the difference x_{n+1}² - x_n² and see if it can be bounded in a way that leads to the desired result.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward. Let's think differently.\n\nThe user mentioned that the problem is interesting and that 8/3 might not be the best constant. Perhaps we can find the actual maximum value of x_n² and show that it's ≤8/3. From the computed terms, the maximum so far is 9/4=2.25, which is less than 8/3≈2.6667, so maybe the bound is not tight, but the problem wants us to prove 8/3.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a closed-form solution of the recurrence. Let's consider writing the recurrence as:\n\nx_{n+1} - x_n = (x_n)/n - x_{n-1}\n\nThis resembles a nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Alternatively, maybe we can find a substitution that transforms it into a telescoping sum or a simpler form.\n\nLet me try to rearrange the equation:\n\nx_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}\n\nMultiply both sides by n:\n\nn x_{n+1} = (n + 1)x_n - n x_{n-1}\n\nRearranged:\n\nn x_{n+1} - (n + 1)x_n + n x_{n-1} = 0\n\nThis is a linear recurrence with variable coefficients. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a substitution.\n\nLet me define y_n = x_n / n. Then:\n\nx_n = n y_n\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nn x_{n+1} = (n + 1)x_n - n x_{n-1}\n\n=> n (n+1) y_{n+1} = (n + 1) n y_n - n (n-1) y_{n-1}\n\nDivide both sides by n:\n\n(n+1) y_{n+1} = (n + 1) y_n - (n - 1) y_{n-1}\n\nThen, divide both sides by (n+1):\n\ny_{n+1} = y_n - [(n - 1)/(n + 1)] y_{n-1}\n\nHmm, this seems a bit simpler, but still not obvious. Let's check the first few terms in terms of y_n.\n\nGiven x₁ = 0 ⇒ y₁ = x₁/1 = 0\n\nx₂ = 1 ⇒ y₂ = x₂/2 = 1/2\n\nx₃ = 3/2 ⇒ y₃ = (3/2)/3 = 1/2\n\nx₄ = 1 ⇒ y₄ = 1/4\n\nx₅ = -1/4 ⇒ y₅ = (-1/4)/5 = -1/20\n\nx₆ = -13/10 ⇒ y₆ = (-13/10)/6 = -13/60 ≈ -0.2167\n\nx₇ ≈ -19/15 ⇒ y₇ ≈ (-19/15)/7 ≈ -19/105 ≈ -0.181\n\nx₈ ≈ -0.1476 ⇒ y₈ ≈ -0.1476/8 ≈ -0.01845\n\nHmm, the y_n sequence starts at 0, then 1/2, 1/2, 1/4, -1/20, -13/60, etc. Not sure if this helps. The recurrence for y_n is y_{n+1} = y_n - [(n - 1)/(n + 1)] y_{n-1}\n\nNot obvious how to solve this. Maybe another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to look for a pattern in the x_n terms. From the calculated terms, after n=3, the sequence starts to decrease and oscillate. Maybe there's a relation with Bessel functions or something similar, as some recurrence relations with variable coefficients relate to special functions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating functions. Let G(z) = sum_{n=1}^∞ x_n z^n. Then, the recurrence relation would translate into a differential equation for G(z). Let's attempt this.\n\nGiven the recurrence:\n\nn x_{n+1} = (n + 1)x_n - n x_{n-1}\n\nMultiply both sides by z^n and sum over n ≥2 (since the recurrence is valid for n ≥2).\n\nSum_{n=2}^∞ n x_{n+1} z^n = Sum_{n=2}^∞ (n + 1)x_n z^n - Sum_{n=2}^∞ n x_{n-1} z^n\n\nLet's adjust indices to express these sums in terms of G(z).\n\nLeft side: Sum_{n=2}^∞ n x_{n+1} z^n = Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1) x_k z^{k-1} } by letting k = n+1. So this becomes Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1)x_k z^{k-1} } = Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1)x_k z^{k-1} } = z Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1)x_k z^{k-2} } = z Sum_{m=2}^∞ m x_{m+1} z^{m-1} } where m = k-1. Not sure if this helps. Maybe better to express in terms of G(z).\n\nLet me denote G(z) = x₁ z + x₂ z² + x₃ z³ + ... = 0*z + 1*z² + (3/2)z³ + 1*z^4 + ...\n\nThen, the left side Sum_{n=2}^∞ n x_{n+1} z^n = Sum_{n=2}^∞ n x_{n+1} z^n = Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1)x_k z^{k-1} } where k = n+1. So this is Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1)x_k z^{k-1} } = Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1)x_k z^{k-1} } = d/dz (Sum_{k=3}^∞ x_k z^{k} ) - correction terms. Wait, maybe differentiating G(z):\n\nG'(z) = Sum_{n=1}^∞ n x_n z^{n-1} } = Sum_{n=1}^∞ n x_n z^{n-1} }\n\nThen, z G'(z) = Sum_{n=1}^∞ n x_n z^n }\n\nSo the left side Sum_{n=2}^∞ n x_{n+1} z^n can be written as Sum_{n=2}^∞ n x_{n+1} z^n = Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1) x_k z^{k-1} } * z = z Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1) x_k z^{k-1} } = z [ Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1) x_k z^{k-1} } ]\n\nBut Sum_{k=3}^∞ (k-1) x_k z^{k-1} } = Sum_{m=2}^∞ m x_{m+1} z^m } where m = k-1. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, this might be z times the derivative shifted by one term.\n\nThis approach is getting too involved. Maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, consider the difference equation:\n\nx_{n+1} + x_{n-1} = (1 + 1/n)x_n\n\nThis resembles the recurrence relation for Bessel functions, but I'm not certain. For example, Bessel functions satisfy recurrence relations like J_{n+1}(x) + J_{n-1}(x) = (2n/x) J_n(x). Not quite the same, but similar structure. If this were the case, maybe x_n relates to Bessel functions, but I don't know the exact connection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the ratio x_{n+1}/x_n and analyze its behavior. Let's compute the ratios for the terms we have:\n\nx₂/x₁: undefined (x₁=0)\n\nx₃/x₂ = (3/2)/1 = 1.5\n\nx₄/x₃ = 1/(3/2) = 2/3 ≈0.6667\n\nx₅/x₄ = (-1/4)/1 = -0.25\n\nx₆/x₅ = (-13/10)/(-1/4) = (13/10)/(1/4) = 13/10 *4=5.2\n\nx₇/x₆ = (-19/15)/(-13/10)= (19/15)/(13/10)=19/15*10/13=38/39≈0.9744\n\nx₈/x₇≈(-0.1476)/(-19/15)≈0.1476/(1.2667)≈0.1165\n\nx₉/x₈≈1.1007/-0.1476≈-7.456\n\nx₁₀/x₉≈1.3706/1.1007≈1.245\n\nx₁₁/x₁₀≈0.407/1.3706≈0.297\n\nx₁₂/x₁₁≈-0.9266/0.407≈-2.276\n\nx₁₃/x₁₂≈-1.411/-0.9266≈1.523\n\nx₁₄/x₁₃≈-0.5984/-1.411≈0.424\n\nx₁₅/x₁₄≈0.7699/-0.5984≈-1.286\n\nx₁₆/x₁₅≈1.4196/0.7699≈1.844\n\nx₁₇/x₁₆≈0.7371/1.4196≈0.519\n\nx₁₈/x₁₇≈-0.6416/0.7371≈-0.870\n\nx₁₉/x₁₈≈-1.411/-0.6416≈2.199\n\nx₂₀/x₁₉≈-0.8434/-1.411≈0.5976\n\nx₂₁/x₂₀≈0.5255/-0.8434≈-0.623\n\nThese ratios alternate in sign and vary in magnitude, but there's no clear pattern. This approach might not be helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: Use the recurrence to express x_{n+1} in terms of x_n and x_{n-1}, then try to bound x_{n+1}² using the given assumption that x_n² ≤8/3 and x_{n-1}² ≤8/3.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nAssume that x_n² ≤8/3 and x_{n-1}² ≤8/3.\n\nThen, x_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}\n\nWe need to bound x_{n+1}². Let's write it as:\n\nx_{n+1} = a x_n - x_{n-1}, where a = 1 + 1/n.\n\nThen, x_{n+1}² = (a x_n - x_{n-1})² = a² x_n² - 2a x_n x_{n-1} + x_{n-1}².\n\nTo bound this, we can use the inequality 2|x_n x_{n-1}| ≤ x_n² + x_{n-1}² (from AM-GM inequality).\n\nThus, -2a x_n x_{n-1} ≤ a (x_n² + x_{n-1}²)\n\nSo, x_{n+1}² ≤ a² x_n² + a (x_n² + x_{n-1}²) + x_{n-1}²\n\n= (a² + a) x_n² + (a + 1) x_{n-1}²\n\nSubstituting a = 1 + 1/n:\n\n= ( (1 + 1/n)^2 + (1 + 1/n) ) x_n² + ( (1 + 1/n) +1 ) x_{n-1}²\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst coefficient:\n\n(1 + 2/n + 1/n²) + (1 + 1/n) = 1 + 2/n + 1/n² +1 +1/n = 2 + 3/n +1/n²\n\nSecond coefficient:\n\n1 + 1/n +1 = 2 +1/n\n\nThus:\n\nx_{n+1}² ≤ (2 + 3/n +1/n²) x_n² + (2 +1/n) x_{n-1}²\n\nNow, assuming x_n² ≤8/3 and x_{n-1}² ≤8/3:\n\nx_{n+1}² ≤ [2 + 3/n +1/n² +2 +1/n ] * (8/3)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the coefficients are multiplied by each x term. Since x_n² and x_{n-1}² are each ≤8/3, then:\n\nx_{n+1}² ≤ (2 +3/n +1/n²)(8/3) + (2 +1/n)(8/3)\n\n= [ (2 +3/n +1/n²) + (2 +1/n) ] *8/3\n\n= [4 +4/n +1/n² ] *8/3\n\nNow, we need this to be ≤8/3. So:\n\n[4 +4/n +1/n² ] *8/3 ≤8/3 ⇒ 4 +4/n +1/n² ≤1\n\nBut 4 +4/n +1/n² is clearly greater than 4 for all n≥1. Thus, this approach gives a bound that is way too loose, and thus it doesn't help.\n\nTherefore, this method doesn't work. Need a different strategy.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe consider the sequence's behavior and find a maximum. From the computed terms, the maximum x_n² seems to occur at n=3 with 9/4=2.25. Perhaps we can prove that this is the maximum and that it's less than 8/3.\n\nBut how to show that x_n² never exceeds 8/3?\n\nAnother idea: Let's look for a conserved quantity or a quantity that decreases monotonically. For example, maybe there's a combination of x_n and x_{n-1} that remains bounded.\n\nAlternatively, consider defining E_n = x_n² + c x_{n}x_{n-1} + d x_{n-1}² for some constants c and d, and find c and d such that E_{n+1} ≤ k E_n for some k <1, ensuring that E_n is bounded.\n\nBut this might be complicated without knowing c and d in advance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the recurrence to express x_{n+1} in terms of x_n and x_{n-1}, then use Cauchy-Schwarz or another inequality.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's assume that x_n² ≤8/3 for all n up to some N, and then for N+1, we can write x_{N+1} in terms of x_N and x_{N-1}, then use the assumed bounds on x_N and x_{N-1} to bound x_{N+1}.\n\nBut earlier attempt showed that this leads to a too-loose bound. However, perhaps if we use the precise values from the recurrence rather than applying inequalities, we might get somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the problem's transformation mentioned by the user, leading to x_{n+1} = 1 + sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) - sum_{k=1}^{n-1}x_k.\n\nLet me check that again. The user wrote:\n\nx_{n+1} -x_1 = sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) - sum_{k=1}^{n-1}x_k.\n\nGiven x_1 =0, this simplifies to x_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^n (x_k /k) - sum_{k=1}^{n-1}x_k.\n\nLet me verify this for n=2:\n\nFor n=2, x₃ = sum_{k=1}^2 (x_k /k) - sum_{k=1}^1 x_k = (x₁/1 + x₂/2) - x₁ = (0 +1/2) -0 =1/2. But x₃ is actually 3/2, which doesn't match. So there must be an error in the user's transformation.\n\nWait, that's a problem. According to the user's transformation, x₃ should be 1/2, but we know x₃=3/2. Therefore, their transformation must be incorrect. Hence, that approach might not be valid, or there might be a mistake in their steps.\n\nLet me re-derive the summation from the recurrence to see where the mistake is.\n\nStarting from the recurrence:\n\nx_{n+1} - x_n = (x_n)/n - x_{n-1}\n\nSumming both sides from n=1 to N:\n\nSum_{n=1}^N (x_{n+1} - x_n) = Sum_{n=1}^N [ (x_n)/n - x_{n-1} ]\n\nLeft side telescopes to x_{N+1} - x_1.\n\nRight side: Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) - Sum_{n=1}^N x_{n-1}\n\nNow, the second sum on the right is Sum_{n=1}^N x_{n-1} = x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + ... +x_{N-1}\n\nGiven x_0 = -1, this sum is -1 + x_1 + x_2 + ... +x_{N-1} = -1 + Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} x_k\n\nTherefore, the right side becomes Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) - (-1 + Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} x_k )\n\n= Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) +1 - Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} x_k\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\nx_{N+1} - x_1 = Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) +1 - Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} x_k\n\nSince x_1 =0, this simplifies to:\n\nx_{N+1} = Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) +1 - Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} x_k\n\nThis is different from what the user wrote. The user wrote x_{n+1} -x_1 = sum_{k=1}^n x_k/k - sum_{k=1}^{n-1}x_k, missing the +1 term. Therefore, the correct expression includes a +1, which the user omitted. This explains why for n=2, the user's expression gives an incorrect result. With the +1, let's check for n=2:\n\nx₃ = Sum_{n=1}^2 (x_n /n) +1 - Sum_{k=1}^1 x_k\n\n= (x₁/1 + x₂/2) +1 - x₁\n\n= (0 + 1/2) +1 -0 = 3/2, which matches the actual x₃=3/2.\n\nSo the correct expression is x_{N+1} = 1 + Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) - Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} x_k.\n\nNow, perhaps this can be used to find a bound.\n\nLet me denote S_N = Sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k.\n\nThen, Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} x_k = S_{N-1}\n\nAlso, Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) is a weighted sum.\n\nBut it's unclear how to proceed. Maybe try to express x_{N+1} in terms of S_N and other sums.\n\nAlternatively, notice that x_{N+1} = 1 + Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) - S_{N-1}\n\nBut S_{N-1} = Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} x_k.\n\nSo x_{N+1} = 1 + Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) - S_{N-1}\n\n= 1 + Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) - (S_N - x_N)\n\n= 1 + Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) - S_N + x_N\n\n= 1 + x_N + Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) - Sum_{n=1}^N x_n\n\n= 1 + x_N + Sum_{n=1}^N x_n (1/n -1 )\n\n= 1 + x_N + Sum_{n=1}^N x_n ( (1 -n)/n )\n\nThis might not help directly. Alternatively, we can write:\n\nx_{N+1} = 1 + x_N + Sum_{n=1}^N x_n (1/n -1 )\n\nBut for n ≥1, 1/n -1 = (1 -n)/n.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe we can split the sum:\n\nSum_{n=1}^N x_n (1/n -1) = Sum_{n=1}^N x_n (1/n) - Sum_{n=1}^N x_n\n\nBut from the earlier expression, x_{N+1} = 1 + Sum_{n=1}^N (x_n /n) - Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} x_k\n\nThis seems to loop back. I'm stuck here.\n\nAlternative idea inspired by the computed terms: The maximum of x_n² occurs at n=3, and then the sequence's squares decrease. If we can show that after n=3, the sequence doesn't exceed 9/4 < 8/3, then the bound holds. But how to formalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use induction starting from n=3, assuming that for all k ≤n, x_k² ≤8/3, and then show that x_{n+1}² ≤8/3. But as earlier attempts showed, this requires a tighter bound.\n\nAlternatively, consider the recurrence in terms of x_{n+1} + x_{n-1} = (1 + 1/n)x_n\n\nLet me try to square both sides:\n\n(x_{n+1} + x_{n-1})^2 = (1 + 1/n)^2 x_n²\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nx_{n+1}² + 2x_{n+1}x_{n-1} + x_{n-1}² = (1 + 2/n + 1/n²) x_n²\n\nRearranged:\n\nx_{n+1}² = (1 + 2/n + 1/n²) x_n² - 2x_{n+1}x_{n-1} - x_{n-1}²\n\nBut this introduces x_{n+1}x_{n-1}, which complicates things. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps look for a telescoping product or some invariant. For example, if we can find a function f(n) such that f(n) x_n² is decreasing, then we can bound x_n².\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio x_{n+1}/x_n and analyze its behavior. But as seen earlier, the ratio alternates and doesn't give a clear pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the approaches tried without success, maybe I should look for a different method or recall similar problems.\n\nWait, perhaps consider writing the recurrence as a second-order linear difference equation and look for a solution using characteristic equations, but since the coefficients are variable, this might not work. Alternatively, consider the homogeneous recurrence:\n\nx_{n+1} - (1 + 1/n)x_n + x_{n-1} = 0\n\nLet me check if there's a solution of the form x_n = C r^n. Substituting:\n\nC r^{n+1} - (1 +1/n) C r^n + C r^{n-1} = 0\n\nDivide by C r^{n-1}:\n\nr² - (1 +1/n) r +1 =0\n\nThe characteristic equation would be r² - (1 +1/n)r +1 =0\n\nSolutions:\n\nr = [ (1 +1/n) ± sqrt((1 +1/n)^2 -4) ] /2\n\nBut this depends on n, so the roots vary with n, making this approach infeasible for a general solution.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the sequence x_n is related to the solution of a differential equation. For instance, sometimes recurrences approximate differential equations for large n. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, consider the recurrence:\n\nn x_{n+1} = (n +1)x_n -n x_{n-1}\n\nLet me define y_n = x_n - x_{n-1}\n\nThen, perhaps express the recurrence in terms of y_n.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nFrom the recurrence:\n\nn x_{n+1} = (n +1)x_n -n x_{n-1}\n\nDivide both sides by n:\n\nx_{n+1} = (1 + 1/n)x_n - x_{n-1}\n\nThis can be written as:\n\nx_{n+1} -x_n = (x_n)/n -x_{n-1}\n\nBut x_{n} -x_{n-1} = y_n\n\nSo x_{n+1} -x_n = y_n /n -x_{n-1}\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, think of the recurrence as:\n\nx_{n+1} -x_n = (x_n -x_{n-1}) /n -x_{n-1}\n\nWait, let me expand the RHS:\n\n(x_n)/n -x_{n-1} = (x_n -n x_{n-1}) /n\n\nBut this doesn't seem to connect to y_n.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for an alternative approach inspired by similar problems.\n\nSuppose we consider the general solution for such a recurrence. If the recurrence had constant coefficients, we could solve it using characteristic equations, but here the coefficients vary with n. One technique for variable coefficients is to look for a solution as a product. Assume x_n = product_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k for some a_k. Let's see if this works.\n\nLet’s suppose x_{n} = product_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k, with x_1 =0. But x_1 =0 would imply that one of the a_k is zero, which would make all subsequent terms zero, which isn't the case here. So this approach is invalid.\n\nAnother method: Look for a particular solution. Suppose there exists a solution of the form x_n = A/n + B. Let's test this.\n\nAssume x_n = A/n + B.\n\nThen, x_{n+1} = A/(n+1) + B\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA/(n+1) + B = (1 +1/n)(A/n + B) - (A/(n-1) + B)\n\nExpand the RHS:\n\n(1 +1/n)(A/n + B) - A/(n-1) - B\n\n= (A/n + B + A/(n²) + B/n) - A/(n-1) - B\n\n= A/n + A/n² + B + B/n - A/(n-1) - B\n\n= A/n + A/n² + B/n - A/(n-1)\n\nSet equal to LHS:\n\nA/(n+1) + B = A/n + A/n² + B/n - A/(n-1)\n\nThis equation should hold for all n ≥2. Let's collect terms involving A and B.\n\nLeft side: A/(n+1) + B\n\nRight side: A/n + A/n² - A/(n-1) + B/n\n\nRearranged:\n\nA/(n+1) - [A/n + A/n² - A/(n-1)] + B - B/n =0\n\nThis must hold for all n, so the coefficients of A and B must each be zero.\n\nFor the A terms:\n\n1/(n+1) - [1/n +1/n² -1/(n-1)] =0\n\nFor the B terms:\n\n1 -1/n =0 ⇒ B=0\n\nBut B=0 would mean that the constant term is zero, which isn't the case here. Thus, this ansatz doesn't work.\n\nPerhaps another ansatz, like x_n = A n + B.\n\nLet’s try x_n = A n + B.\n\nThen, x_{n+1} = A(n+1) + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA(n+1) + B = (1 +1/n)(A n + B) - (A(n-1) + B)\n\nExpand RHS:\n\n(1 +1/n)(A n + B) - A(n-1) - B\n\n= A n + B + A + B/n - A n + A - B\n\n= (A n - A n) + (B - B) + A + A + B/n\n\n= 2A + B/n\n\nSet equal to LHS:\n\nA(n+1) + B = 2A + B/n\n\nLeft side: A n + A + B\n\nRight side: 2A + B/n\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nFor n terms: A =0\n\nConstant terms: A + B = 2A ⇒ B =A\n\nBut A=0, so B=0. Thus, trivial solution x_n=0, which doesn't satisfy x₂=1. Hence, this ansatz also fails.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the solution involves harmonic numbers. Let me recall that harmonic numbers H_n = sum_{k=1}^n 1/k. But I don't see a direct connection.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the recurrence resembles the discrete version of a differential equation. For instance, consider the recurrence:\n\nx_{n+1} -x_n = (x_n)/n -x_{n-1}\n\nIf we approximate this as a differential equation, treating n as a continuous variable, but this is a stretch and might not yield accurate results.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for a solution using the method of generating functions, but as I tried earlier, it's complex.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should consider that the problem might require an advanced technique or a clever substitution that I'm not seeing. Alternatively, maybe the bound of 8/3 can be proven using induction with a smarter application of inequalities, leveraging the specific structure of the recurrence.\n\nLet me try induction again, but this time, instead of assuming x_n² ≤8/3 and x_{n-1}² ≤8/3, perhaps assume a stronger inductive hypothesis that includes relations between x_n and x_{n-1}.\n\nSuppose that for all k ≤n, x_k² ≤8/3 and that |x_k| ≤ some function of k that ensures x_{k+1} stays within bounds.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that for all k ≤n, x_k² ≤8/3 and also |x_k| ≤2. Then, since sqrt(8/3)≈1.632, this is a stronger assumption. Let's see:\n\nAssume |x_k| ≤2 for all k ≤n. Then, for x_{n+1} = (1 +1/n)x_n -x_{n-1}:\n\n|x_{n+1}| ≤ (1 +1/n)|x_n| + |x_{n-1}| ≤ (1 +1/n)*2 +2 = 2 +2/n +2 =4 +2/n\n\nBut this gives |x_{n+1}| ≤4 +2/n, which is way larger than 2, so this approach fails.\n\nAlternatively, assume that |x_k| ≤ sqrt(8/3) for all k ≤n. Then, |x_{n+1}| ≤ (1 +1/n)sqrt(8/3) + sqrt(8/3) = sqrt(8/3)(2 +1/n)\n\nAs before, this is greater than sqrt(8/3)*2 ≈3.265, which is way larger than sqrt(8/3), so this approach doesn't work.\n\nThus, direct induction on the absolute value doesn't help.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps analyze the sequence's energy. Define E_n = x_n^2 + x_{n-1}^2. Let's see how E_n evolves.\n\nFrom the recurrence:\n\nx_{n+1} = (1 +1/n)x_n -x_{n-1}\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx_{n+1}^2 = (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}^2\n\nThen, E_{n+1} = x_{n+1}^2 +x_n^2 = (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}^2 +x_n^2\n\n= [ (1 + 2/n +1/n²) x_n^2 +x_n^2 ] -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}^2\n\n= (2 + 2/n +1/n²) x_n^2 -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}^2\n\nCompare this to E_n = x_n^2 +x_{n-1}^2\n\nWe can write E_{n+1} = (2 + 2/n +1/n²) x_n^2 -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}^2\n\nIf we can show that E_{n+1} ≤ k E_n for some k <1 or that E_{n+1} ≤8/3 + something, maybe we can establish a bound.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's try using the inequality -2ab ≤a² + b²:\n\n-2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} ≤ (1 +1/n)x_n^2 + (1 +1/n)x_{n-1}^2\n\nThus,\n\nE_{n+1} ≤ (2 +2/n +1/n²)x_n^2 + (1 +1/n)x_n^2 + (1 +1/n)x_{n-1}^2 +x_{n-1}^2\n\nWait, this approach might not be correct. Let me re-express:\n\nUsing -2ab ≤ a² + b², we have:\n\n-2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} ≤ (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 +x_{n-1}^2\n\nTherefore,\n\nE_{n+1} = (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}^2 +x_n^2\n\n≤ (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 + (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 +x_{n-1}^2 +x_n^2\n\nWait, no. The correct application of the inequality would replace -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} with ≤ (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 +x_{n-1}^2. So:\n\nE_{n+1} = (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}^2 +x_n^2\n\n≤ (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 + (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 +x_{n-1}^2 +x_n^2\n\nBut this seems incorrect. Let me start over.\n\nThe term -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} can be bounded using the inequality:\n\nFor any real numbers a and b, and any t >0, -2ab ≤ t a² + (1/t) b².\n\nLet's choose t = (1 +1/n).\n\nThen, -2ab ≤ t a² + (1/t) b²\n\nThus, -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} ≤ (1 +1/n)x_n^2 + (1 +1/n)^{-1} x_{n-1}^2\n\nTherefore, substituting back into E_{n+1}:\n\nE_{n+1} ≤ (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 + (1 +1/n)x_n^2 + (1 +1/n)^{-1} x_{n-1}^2 +x_{n-1}^2\n\nBut this is getting too messy. Alternatively, perhaps use a different value of t to optimize the bound.\n\nAlternatively, use the inequality -2ab ≤ a² + b², which gives:\n\n-2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} ≤ (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 +x_{n-1}^2\n\nThus:\n\nE_{n+1} = (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}^2 +x_n^2\n\n≤ (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 + (1 +1/n)^2 x_n^2 +x_{n-1}^2 +x_n^2\n\n= [ (1 +1/n)^2 + (1 +1/n)^2 +1 ] x_n^2 +x_{n-1}^2\n\nThis seems to lead to an increasing bound, which isn't helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm not making progress with algebraic manipulations, perhaps I should consider another strategy. Since the problem is to show that x_n² ≤8/3 for all n, and from the computed terms, the maximum seems to be at n=3 with 9/4=2.25, which is less than 8/3≈2.6667, perhaps the bound is not tight, but it's what needs to be proven.\n\nMaybe we can consider the maximum possible value of x_n² given the recurrence and initial conditions. For example, assume that x_n² achieves its maximum at some n, and then show that this maximum cannot exceed 8/3.\n\nSuppose there exists an n where x_n² is maximal. For such an n, we have x_n² ≥x_{n-1}² and x_n² ≥x_{n+1}².\n\nUsing the recurrence:\n\nx_{n+1} = (1 +1/n)x_n -x_{n-1}\n\nAssuming x_n is a local maximum, then x_{n}² ≥x_{n+1}².\n\nThus:\n\nx_n² ≥ [(1 +1/n)x_n -x_{n-1}]^2\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\nx_n² ≥ (1 +1/n)^2 x_n² - 2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}²\n\nRearranging:\n\n0 ≥ [ (1 +1/n)^2 -1 ]x_n² -2(1 +1/n)x_n x_{n-1} +x_{n-1}²\n\nLet me compute the coefficient:\n\n(1 +2/n +1/n²) -1 = 2/n +1/n²\n\nThus:\n\n0 ≥ (2/n +1/n²)x_n",
