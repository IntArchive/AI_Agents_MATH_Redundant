    "Content": "I know how to prove that it happens, by proving that the left coset definition actually is an equivalence relation. Then, it's proved that it partitions the set, since equivalence relations do it. However, this exercise asks me to prove it in a diferente way. First it asks me to show that: a) The union of the left cosets is equal to $G$ b) If $gH \\cap g'H \\neq \\emptyset$ then $gH = g'H$ for $a)$ I'm  thinking about the following: $gH = \\{gh, h\\in H\\}$ So if $G = \\{g_1, g_2, \\cdots g_n\\}$ We would have the following left cosets: $$g_1H = \\{g_1h, h\\in H\\}$$\n$$g_2H = \\{g_2h, h\\in H\\}$$\n$$\\cdots$$\n$$g_nH = \\{g_nh, h\\in H\\}$$ The union of all these sets will include all the $g's$, since for each set $$g_k = \\{g_kh, h\\in H\\}$$ we have $$ge \\in g_k = \\{g_kh, h\\in H\\}$$ where $e$ is the identity. Then if we make the union of all these sets we'll have at least all the elements of $g$. The other elements are merely $gh$ for some $h$. But since $gh\\in G$ they would be repeated elements in the union, doesn't matter. So, the union of all left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is $G$. Is my reasoning correct? Also, what could I do to prove $b)$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is the proof for (b) suppose that there is an element $c \\in gH \\cap g^\\prime H$ so that means that $c \\in gH$ and $c \\in g^\\prime H$ then this means that there are elements $a,b \\in H$ such that $c = ga$ and $c = g^\\prime b$ now this implies that $$c=ga=g^\\prime b$$ which also implies that \n$$g = g^\\prime b a^{-1}$$\n because we can right multiply by $a^{-1}$ on each side. However, observe that $ba^{-1} \\in H$ (Closure of groups) and so $$g \\in  g^\\prime H$$ and so for any $a \\in H$, $ga \\in g ^\\prime H$ which implies that $$gH \\subseteq g^\\prime H$$\nBy a symmetrical argument ,$$g^\\prime H \\subseteq gH$$ and hence $$gH = g^\\prime H$$ Your argument for part (a) Looks decent :)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's instructions. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem as specified. \n\nThe original question is about showing that left cosets partition a group. The user mentions two parts: a) the union of left cosets equals G, and b) if two cosets intersect, they are equal. The example given in the problem uses an equivalence relation, but the exercise wants a different approach.\n\nLooking at the example provided by the user, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. \n\nSo, applying that here, the problem is about a group G and a subgroup H. The assumptions would likely include that H is a subgroup of G. The problem then has two parts: part a) to show the union of left cosets is G, and part b) that distinct cosets don't overlap. \n\nWait, the user's example for the formatted problem included the assumptions from the problem. In this case, the problem is about left cosets partitioning the group. The key assumptions here are that H is a subgroup of G. Because the properties of cosets depend on H being a subgroup. The original problem doesn't explicitly state H is a subgroup, but from the context of the question (talking about left cosets), it's implied. So I need to make sure that's included as an assumption.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n- G is a group.\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\nEach of these is a separate line, each addressing one property. Then the problem is to prove that the left cosets of H in G partition G, specifically by showing parts a) and b) as given.\n\nThe original problem statement in the user's example included the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is to show the union of left cosets is G and that intersecting cosets are equal. But since the problem is split into parts a and b, maybe the user wants both parts included in the problem statement. But according to the format, the problem should be a single statement. However, the original example had the problem as a single statement. But in the current case, the problem has two parts. So perhaps the problem should be stated as two separate parts. But the user's example didn't have parts. Hmm. Let me check the original example again.\n\nIn the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem has two parts a) and b). However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem as per the example. The example combined the problem into one statement, so maybe here, we need to do the same. But the original problem's question is to \"Show that left cosets partition the group\" by proving a) and b). So perhaps the problem statement should be to show that left cosets partition the group by proving a) the union is G and b) distinct cosets are disjoint. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove both parts a and b as steps towards showing the partition. The user's formatted example included only the problem statement, not the parts. So maybe the problem is \"Show that left cosets partition the group by proving that a) the union of left cosets is G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, they are equal.\" But the original problem mentions parts a and b, so perhaps the problem should include both parts. However, the user's format example didn't split the problem into parts. Maybe the user wants the problem to be as stated in the original question's main task. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"However, this exercise asks me to prove it in a different way. First it asks me to show that: a) The union of the left cosets is equal to G. b) If gH ∩ g'H ≠ ∅ then gH = g'H.\"\n\nSo the problem is to show that left cosets partition G by proving a) and b). Thus, the problem statement in the formatted version should be: \"Show that the left cosets of H in G partition G by proving a) the union of all left cosets is G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, they are equal.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is written as a single statement. So perhaps combining both parts into the problem statement. Let me check the example again. The example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So similarly, here the problem would be \"Prove that the left cosets of H in G partition G by showing that a) the union of all left cosets is G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, they are equal.\" But maybe the user wants the problem to be split into a) and b) as separate problems. But according to the user's example, the problem is a single problem. Alternatively, the user might expect the problem to be the main task, and parts a and b are steps. But the user's instructions say to structure the problem as per the example. The example didn't have parts. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be written as the original question's main task, which is to \"Show that left cosets partition the group,\" with the parts a and b being the method. However, in the user's example, they included the problem as given. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to answer parts a) and b) as per the exercise. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the two parts as the problem. But the user's example included only one problem. Wait, maybe the user's example combined the problem into one statement. Let me check. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which was the problem statement. Here, the problem is to show that left cosets partition the group by proving a and b. Therefore, the problem statement would be: \"Show that the left cosets of H in G partition G by proving a) the union of all left cosets is equal to G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, then they are equal.\"\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a group.\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\nThen the problem is: \"Show that the left cosets of H in G partition G by proving a) the union of all left cosets is equal to G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, then they are equal.\"\n\nBut maybe the problem should be split into two separate problems a) and b). However, according to the user's example, it's one problem. The user's example had the problem as a single statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem is written as two parts in the problem statement. Alternatively, the user's example didn't split the problem into parts. The original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was the same. Here, the original problem's main task is to show that left cosets partition the group, with parts a and b as steps. Therefore, the problem statement should encapsulate that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the problem to be as the original question's first line: \"Show that left cosets partition the group,\" and the parts a and b are part of the problem's requirements. So the problem would be: \"Show that left cosets partition the group by proving that a) the union of all left cosets is equal to G, and b) two left cosets are either disjoint or equal.\" But maybe more concisely.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question's title is \"Show that left cosets partition the group,\" and the body asks to do this via parts a and b, the formatted problem should reflect that. Therefore, the problem is \"Show that left cosets partition the group by proving a) the union of all left cosets is equal to G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, they are equal.\"\n\nSo in conclusion:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- G is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that the left cosets of H in G partition G by proving a) the union of all left cosets is equal to G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, then they are equal.\n\nBut maybe the problem is just \"Show that left cosets partition the group,\" and the parts a and b are part of the problem's instruction. However, the example includes the problem as stated, so perhaps the problem should be as in the original question's main task. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question's problem: \"However, this exercise asks me to prove it in a different way. First it asks me to show that: a) The union of the left cosets is equal to $G$ b) If $gH \\cap g'H \\neq \\emptyset$ then $gH = g'H$\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that the left cosets partition the group by showing a) and b). Therefore, the formatted problem should include both parts as the problem statement. Therefore, the problem is to \"Show that the left cosets of H in G partition G by proving a) the union of all left cosets is G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, then they are equal.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the title is \"Show that left cosets partition the group,\" the problem could be phrased as that, and then the parts a and b are steps. But the example didn't include steps, just the problem. However, the user's instructions said to structure the problem as per the example, which just had the problem statement. So perhaps in this case, the problem is \"Show that the left cosets of H in G partition G,\" and the parts a and b are part of the method. But the user wants the problem to be structured as per the original problem's explicit question. Since the user's example took the original problem's main question and formatted it, here the main problem is to show left cosets partition the group via a) and b), so the problem statement should include both parts.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- G is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that the left cosets of H in G partition G by proving a) the union of all left cosets is equal to G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, then they are equal.\n\nBut checking the example again, the problem in the example was written as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, the problem would be \"Show that the left cosets of H in G partition G,\" with the assumptions that G is a group and H is a subgroup. However, the original question's problem requires proving parts a) and b). So perhaps to accurately capture the problem as per the user's example, the problem statement should be to \"Show that the left cosets of H in G partition G,\" and the parts a) and b) are the method. But according to the user's instructions, we need to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The original problem says \"prove it in a different way. First, show a) union is G, and b) intersecting cosets are equal.\" So the core problem is to prove the partition via a and b. Hence, the problem statement should include both parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is \"Prove that the left cosets of H in G partition G,\" and the assumptions are G is a group, H is a subgroup. But the original problem specifies proving via a) and b), so perhaps the problem is structured with those parts. However, the user's example didn't include parts. The example had the problem as a single statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem is \"Prove that the left cosets of H in G partition G by showing that a) the union of all left cosets is G and b) any two left cosets are either disjoint or equal.\" So yes, combining both parts into the problem statement.\n\nThus, after this lengthy consideration, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- G is a group.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that the left cosets of H in G partition G by proving a) the union of all left cosets is equal to G, and b) if two left cosets intersect, then they are equal.",
