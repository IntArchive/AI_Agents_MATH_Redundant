    "Content": "I'm looking at an old qualifying exam, and one question is to prove the following inequality in any normed vector space:\n$$ |\\|x\\|^2 - \\|y\\|^2| \\le \\|x-y\\|\\|x+y\\| $$ My initial thought was that\n$$ |\\|x\\|^2 - \\|y\\|^2| = |(\\|x\\|+\\|y\\|)(\\|x\\|-\\|y\\|)|=\\left|(\\|x\\|+\\|y\\|)\\right||(\\|x\\|-\\|y\\|)|,$$\nand it's easy to show $|\\|x\\|-\\|y\\||$ is less than both $\\|x-y\\|$ and $\\|x+y\\|$, but it isn't true that $\\|x\\|+\\|y\\|$ is less than either in general (by the triangle inequality it's 'usually' larger than the latter), so I'm unsure what to do. Any guidance is appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We may assume w.l.o.g. that $\\|x\\|^2 \\geq \\|y\\|^2$. Write $x = u + v$ and $y = u - v$. Now the inequality can be rewritten as\n$$\n\\|u + v\\|^2 \\leq 4 \\|u\\| \\|v\\| + \\|u - v\\|^2.\n$$\nBut this is the inequality one gets by combining $\\|u + v\\|^2 \\leq (\\|u\\| + \\|v\\|)^2$ and $|\\|u\\| - \\|v\\||^2 \\leq \\|u - v\\|^2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Normed vector space inequality |‖x‖² − ‖y‖²| ≤ ‖x−y‖‖x+y‖\". The question states that the task is to prove this inequality in any normed vector space. The user tried expanding the left-hand side using the difference of squares and then applied some properties of norms but got stuck because the triangle inequality didn't directly help.\n\nNow, I need to format this problem according to the example provided. The example lists each assumption line by line, addressing only one property or condition per line, applied to one object. Then states the problem.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the key elements are:\n\n1. The space is a normed vector space.\n2. The inequality to prove is |‖x‖² − ‖y‖²| ≤ ‖x−y‖‖x+y‖.\n\nBut wait, in the example, assumptions included specific conditions on the objects. Here, the problem is general for any x and y in a normed vector space. The only assumptions here are that x and y are elements of a normed vector space. However, the original problem doesn't specify any additional constraints on x and y except that they are in the space. So maybe the assumptions are just that x and y are vectors in a normed vector space. But in the example given by the user, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is in any normed vector space, so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The space is a normed vector space.\n- x and y are elements of this space.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a single line, one property per object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is a normed vector space.\nx is an element of the space.\ny is an element of the space.\n\nBut the problem doesn't have any additional conditions like specific values or constraints on x and y beyond being in the space. So the assumptions are about the space being normed and x, y being vectors in it. However, in the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is general. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a normed vector space.\nx ∈ V.\ny ∈ V.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the inequality for any x, y in any normed vector space. So the main assumptions are the setting (normed vector space) and that x and y are vectors in that space. Since the problem is in any normed space, we don't have specific conditions on x and y other than their existence in the space. Thus, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is a normed vector space.\nx is a vector in the space.\ny is a vector in the space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |‖x‖² − ‖y‖²| ≤ ‖x−y‖‖x+y‖.\n\nI think that's it. The original problem doesn't have additional constraints. The user might have been confused because in their initial attempt, they tried to apply triangle inequality directly but didn't see the connection. However, the problem as stated doesn't impose any extra conditions, so the assumptions are just the general setting.",
