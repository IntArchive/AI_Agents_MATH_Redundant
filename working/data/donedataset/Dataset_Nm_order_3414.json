His answer handles the case when $S$ is the spectrum of a non-perfect field. This post will discuss the more subtle case of $S=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ . We make the following claim: Claim 1: Let $n$ be an integer such that there exists a prime $p>2$ such that $p\\mid n$ . Then the sequence $$0\\to \\mu_n\\to\\mathbb{G}_m\\to\\mathbb{G}_m\\to 0$$ of abelian presheaves on $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is exact in the fppf topology but not in the etale topology. In particular, exactness fails at second $\\mathbb{G}_m$ term. The fact that it's a short exact sequence of fppf sheaves is classical. Namely, exactness at all points except the second $\\mathbb{G}_m$ -term is clear. If $X\\to\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is any object of the fppf site of $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ and $u\\in \\mathcal{O}_X(X)^\\times$ then the affine morphism $\\underline{\\mathrm{Spec}}(\\mathcal{O}_X[t]/(t^p-u))\\to X$ is an fppf cover over which $u$ obtains a $p^\\text{th}$ root, which shows exactness at the second $\\mathbb{G}_m$ in the fppf topology. It's also clear that the only place that exactness of this sequence can fail as sheaves on etale site of $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is at the second $\\mathbb{G}_m$ . To proceed further recall that the sequence of presheaves $$0\\to\\mu_n\\to\\mathbb{G}_m\\to\\mathbb{G}_m\\to 0$$ is exact on the etale site of $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ if and only if for all geometric points $\\overline{s}$ of $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ the sequence $$0\\to \\mu_n(\\mathcal{O}_{S,\\overline{s}})\\to \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{Spec}(\\Z),\\overline{s}}^\\times\\xrightarrow{x\\mapsto x^n}\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{Spec}(\\Z),\\overline{s}}^\\times\\to 0\\qquad (1)$$ is exact. This follows from Tag03PU and the fact that if $\\mathcal{F}$ is a representable presheaf on $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ given $\\mathrm{Hom}(-,X)$ with $X\\to\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ finite type then $$\\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{F}_{\\overline{s}} &=\\varinjlim_{(U,\\overline{u})}\\mathcal{F}(U)\\\\ &=\\varinjlim_{(U,\\overline{u})}\\Hom(U,X)\\\\ &\\overset{(*)}{=}\\Hom(\\varprojlim_{(U,\\overline{u})}U,X)\\\\ &= \\Hom(\\Spec(\\varinjlim_{(U,\\overline{u})}\\mathcal{O}_U(U)),X)\\\\ &= \\Hom(\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}),\\overline{s}}),X)\\\\ &= X(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}),\\overline{s}})\\end{aligned}$$ where $(\\ast)$ follows from Tag01ZC . Now, let's suppose that $\\overline{s}:\\mathrm{Spec}(k(\\overline{s}))\\to S$ is a geometric point of $S$ rooted at the point $p$ . Let $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ denote the algebraic (=separable) closure of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ in $k(\\overline{s})$ . Then, $\\mathcal{O}_{S,\\overline{s}}$ is nothing but the strict Henselization of $\\mathbb{Z}$ at $(p)$ which we denote $R$ . Thus, we see to show that the Kummer sequence is not exact it suffices to show that the sequence of abelian groups $$0\\to \\mu_n(R)\\to R^\\times\\xrightarrow{x\\mapsto x^n} R^\\times\\to 0$$ is not exact, or, really that it's not exact at the second $R^\\times$ or that not every element of $R^\\times$ has an $n^\\text{th}$ -root. We will do this by showing that there are elements of $R^\\times$ that don't have $p^\\text{th}$ roots. Let us make the following claim: Lemma 1: The ring $R$ is the integral closure of $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ in the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p^\\un$ in $\\Q_p^\\un$ the maximal unramified extension of $\\Q_p$ . Proof: Let $S$ denote the henselization of $\\Z_{(p)}$ at $(p)$ . Then, $S$ is the integral closure of $\\Z_{(p)}$ in $\\Z_p$ . There are several ways to see this. One is to use Artin Approximation . One can also use the construction of henselizations in Nagata's book Local Rings (middle of page 180). There, since $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ is normal (with perfect residue field) he constructs $S$ as follows. Let $\\widetilde{S}$ be the integral closure of $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ in $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ . Let $\\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $\\widetilde{S}$ dividing $p$ . Let $D:=D(\\mathfrak{p}\\mid p)\\subseteq \\mathrm{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\Q)$ denote the decomposition group of $\\mathfrak{p}$ --the subgroup of Galois group elements fixing $\\mathfrak{p}$ . Then, he describes $S$ as $\\widetilde{S}^D$ . Note though that completing $\\overline{\\Q}$ at $\\mathfrak{p}$ one obtains the field $\\mathbb{C}_p$ of complex numbers and one can identify $D$ with $\\mathrm{Gal}(\\overline{\\Q_p}/\\Q_p)$ or the norm-preserving automorphisms of $\\mathbb{C}_p/\\Q_p$ . Note then that $S$ embeds into the $\\Gal(\\overline{\\Q_p}/\\Q_p)$ -invariants of $\\mathbb{C}_p$ . But, these are nothing more than $\\Q_p$ (e.g. see Proposition 2.1.2 of this ). Thus, $S$ is evidently contained in the integral closure of $\\Z_{(p)}$ in $\\Z_p$ . But, the reverse inclusion is clear. To deduce now that $R$ is the integral closure of $\\Z_{(p)}$ in $\\Z_p^\\un$ we proceed as follows. Note that the residue field $S$ is $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and so by Tag0BSL it suffices to for each $n\\geqslant 1$ construct the unique finite connected etale cover $\\mathrm{Spec}(R_n)$ of $S$ with residue field $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ . Note though that this can be easily seen $R_n=S[\\zeta_{p^n-1}]$ which is clearly the integral closure of $S$ in $\\Z_{p^n}$ (the ring of integers of the unique unramified extension of degree $n$ ) since $\\Z_{p^n}=\\Z[\\zeta_{p^n-1}]$ . Letting $n$ tend to infinity gives the desired result. $\\blacksquare$ From this, we obtain the following corollary: Corollary 1: An element $u\\in R^\\times$ has a $p^\\text{th}$ root in $R^\\times$ if and only if there exists a root $\\alpha$ of $x^p-u$ such that $\\Q_p(\\alpha)/\\Q_p$ is unramified. Proof: Note that since the equation $x^p-u=0$ is monic and $R$ is integrally closed in $\\Q_p^\\un$ we see that this equation has a solution in $R$ (if and only if it has a solution $R^\\times$ for obvious reasons) if and only if it has a solution in $\\Q_p^\\un$ . Moreover, such a solution $\\alpha$ in $\\overline{\\Q_p}$ will lie in $\\Q_p^\\un$ if and only if $\\Q_p(\\alpha)/\\Q_p$ is unramified. $\\blacksquare$ Thus, to finish the proof of the claim it suffices to produce elements of $u\\in R^\\times$ such that for any root $\\alpha$ of $x^p-u$ in $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$ we have that $\\Q_p(\\alpha)/\\Q_p$ is ramified. To wit, we have the following: Lemma 2: Let $u\\in R^\\times$ be such that $u=1\\mod p$ but $u\\ne 1\\mod p^2$ . Then, for all roots $\\alpha$ of $x^p-u$ in $\\overline{\\Q_p}$ we have that $\\Q_p(\\alpha)/\\Q_p$ is totally ramified of degree $p$ . Proof: Set $f(x)=x^p-u$ then substituting $x=t+1$ gives the polynomial $$f(t)=t^p+p q(t)-(u-1)$$ where $q(t)\\in \\mathbb{Z}[t]$ (which follows from the Binomoial Theorem). This shows that $f$ is Eisenstein and thus irreducible. The ramifiedness claim then follows from classical algebraic number theory (e.g. see Theorem 3.1 of this). $\\blacksquare$ So, for instance, we see that $1+p\\in R^\\times$ does not have a $p^\\text{th}$ root. As another example, let $q\\in\\Z$ be as in the answer of Minseon Shin. Note then that since $q^{p-1}\\ne 1\\mod p^2$ implies that its order in $(\\Z/p^2\\Z)^\\times\\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p(p-1)\\Z$ is divisible by $p$ . Thus, we see that $q':=q^{p-1}$ satisfies $(q')^{p-1}\\ne 1\\mod p^2$ and thus $q'$ has no $p^\\text{th}$ root in $R^\\times$ as in the answer of Minseon Shin. But, the above gives an alternative proof that $q'$ has no root in $R^\\times$ since $q'=1\\mod p$ but $q'\\ne 1\\mod p^2$ . Conversely, the above actually shows that for any $q$ as in Minseon Shin's answer and any root $\\alpha$ of $x^p-q$ in $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$ we have that $\\Q_p(\\alpha)/\\Q_p)$ is ramified. In fact, we can actually explicitly describe the cokernel of the $p^\\text{th}$ power map on $R^\\times$ : Claim 2: The cokernel of $R^\\times\\xrightarrow{x\\mapsto x^p}R^\\times$ can be identified with $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ . Proof: Let us note that every element of $f\\in R^\\times$ can be written uniquely in the form $f=\\zeta u$ with $\\zeta\\in \\mu^p(R)$ and $u=1\\mod p$ where $$\\mu^p(R):=\\bigcup_{(m,p)=1}\\mu_m(R)$$ Indeed, note that we have a multiplicative Teichmuller map $[-]:\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}^\\times\\to R^\\times$ which follows from Henselianess. If one is more familiar with the Witt vector construction another way to see the existence of this map is to note that $R\\subseteq \\Z_p^\\mathrm{un}\\subseteq W(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p})$ because this latter ring is the completion of the former. By classical theory we have a multiplicative Teichmuller map $[-]:\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}^\\times\\to W(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p})^\\times$ . But, since the image of $[-]$ lands in $\\Z_p^\\mathrm{un}$ (since this already contains all prime-to- $p$ roots of unity) and these are integral over $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ they lie in $\\mu^p(R)\\subseteq R^\\times$ . So then, note that for any $f\\in R^\\times$ we can write $$f=[f\\mod p]([f\\mod p]^{-1} f)$$ which gives a decomposition $f=\\zeta u$ as desired. The unicity is clear. Note that the $p^\\text{th}$ -power map is surjective on $\\mu^p(R)$ and thus we see that $R^\\times/(R^\\times)^p$ can be identified with $(1+pR)/(1+pR)^p$ . We claim that this is isomorphic to $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ . To do this, we first note the following lemma: Lemma 3: Let $u\\in R^\\times$ be such that $u=1\\mod p$ . Then, $u$ has $p^\\text{th}$ root in $R^\\times$ if and only if $u=1\\mod p^2$ . Proof: The necessity of the claim is clear from Lemma 2. So, it suffices to show that if $u=1\\mod p^2$ then $u$ has a $p^\\text{th}$ root. Note that since $u\\in R_n:= S[\\zeta_{p^n-1}]$ (i.e. $R_n$ is the integral closure of $\\Z_{(p)}$ in $\\Z_{p^n}=\\Z_p[\\zeta_{p^n-1}]$ ) it suffices to show that $u$ has a $p^\\text{th}$ root in $R_n$ . But, since $R_n$ is integrally closed in $\\Z_{p^n}$ it suffices to show that $u$ has a $p^\\text{th}$ root in $\\Z_{p^n}$ . Note though that since $|u-1|\\leqslant p^{-2}$ we have that $\\log(u)$ exists in $\\Z_{p^n}^\\times$ and $|\\log(u)|=|u-1|$ (e.g. see Theorem 8.7 of this ). Since $|\\log(u)|\\leqslant p^{-2}$ we know that $p^{-1}\\log(u)\\in \\Z_{p^n}^\\times$ and, in fact, $|p^{-1}\\log(u)|\\leqslant p^{-1}$ . Thus, we see that $\\exp(p^{-1}\\log(u)$ is a well-defined element of $\\Z_{p^n}^\\times$ . Noting then that $\\exp(p^{-1}\\log(u))^p=u$ finishes the claim. $\\blacksquare$ From this it's easy to see that $(1+p R)/(1+pR)^p$ can be identified with $(1+pR)/(1+p^2 R)$ . To see that this is isomorphic to $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ we may proceed as follows. Note that we have an isomorphism $$(1+p R)/(1+p^2 R)\\to pR/p^2 R$$ given by taking $1+px$ to $px$ . Thus, it suffices to explain why $pR/p^2 R\\cong \\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}$ . But, this is easy since $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p}\\cong R/pR$ and we have a natural isomorphism $R/pR\\to pR/p^2 R$ given by $x\\mapsto px$ . $\\blacksquare$ As a last point, here's something to point out. A priori you might believe that what is really play here is the fact $p$ is not invertible in $\\mathbb{Z}$ . But, note the following: Observation 1: If $S$ is a scheme over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ which is perfect (i.e. the absolute Frobenius $F_S:S\\to S$ is an isomorphism) then the same is true for all etale maps $X\\to S$ . Proof: This follows from the fact that since $X/S$ is etale we have that $F_{X/S}:X\\to X^{(p)}$ is an isomorphism. Indeed, note that $F_{X/S}$ is a universal homeomorphism by Tag0CCB . But, in addition, we see that the composition $X\\to X^{(p)}\\to S$ is etale since it coincides with $X\\to S$ . But, in addition the diagonal of $X^{(p)}\\to S$ is etale (in fact an open embedding) since $X^{(p)}$ is etale (being the pullback of the map $X\\to S$ along $F_S$ ). Thus, by the cancellation lemma $F_{X/S}$ is etale. But, by Tag025G that fact that $F_{X/S}$ is an etale homeomorphism implies it's an isomomorphism. Finally, note that $F_X$ is the composition of $F_{X/S}$ and the map $X^{(p)}\\to X$ (which is a base change of $F_S$ and thus an isomorphism) and thus an isomorphism $\\blacksquare$ Corollary 2: If $S$ is a perfect $\\mathbb{F}_p$ -scheme then the $p$ -Kummer sequence $$0\\to\\mu_p\\to\\mathbb{G}_m\\to\\mathbb{G}_m\\to 0$$ is exact on the etale site of $S$ . Proof: Let $X\\to S$ be an object of the etale site of $S$ and let $u\\in \\mathcal{O}_X(X)^\\times$ . We want to show that etale locally on $X$ we have that $u$ is a $p^\\text{th}$ power. But, since $X\\to S$ is etale by the above observation we see that $X$ is perfect so, in fact, $u$ is a $p^\\text{th}$ power already in $X$ . $\\blacksquare$ So,the $p$ -Kummer sequence is an exact sequence on all residue fields of $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ since these residue fields are either characteristic not $p$ or perfect of characteristic $p$ , but is not an etale sequence integrally on $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ . Something very subtle and interesting is happening integrally!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is working on an exercise related to the Kummer sequence in the étale topology. The original exact sequence is given when n is invertible on the base scheme S. The task is to provide a counterexample where n is not invertible, showing the sequence isn't exact anymore.\n\nFirst, the original setup: the category is schemes over S, and n is a global unit in Γ(S, O_S). The exact sequence is 0 → μ_{n,S} → 𝔾_m → 𝔾_m → 0 with the last map x ↦ x^n. When n is invertible, this is exact in étale topology. The user's goal is to find a case where n isn't invertible and the sequence isn't exact.\n\nThe user tried S = Spec(ℤ), which makes sense because if n is not invertible in ℤ, that is, if n is not ±1. For example, take n = 2. Then 2 isn't a unit in ℤ, so that's a candidate. The user wants a scheme U and a section s in 𝔾_m(U) such that there's no étale cover where s becomes an nth power. They tried s = 1. Wait, but 1 is already a nth power (1 = 1^n), so that might not work. Maybe they need a different s?\n\nWait, the problem is that the surjectivity of the map 𝔾_m → 𝔾_m (x ↦ x^n) in the étale topology fails when n is not invertible. So, to find a counterexample, we need a scheme U and a section s in 𝔾_m(U) such that s is not locally an nth power in the étale topology. But the user tried s=1, which is always an nth power, so that's not the right choice. Maybe instead take a scheme where s is not an nth power, even étale locally.\n\nFor example, take S = Spec(ℤ), n = 2. Let’s take U = Spec(ℤ) again, and s = 2. Then, in the global sections, we have 2 ∈ 𝔾_m(ℤ) = ℤ^*. But wait, ℤ^* is {1, -1}, so 2 isn't even in 𝔾_m(ℤ). Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe U should be a different scheme where s is a unit. Like U = Spec(ℤ[1/2]), but then 2 is invertible there. Wait, but if we take n=2 and S=Spec(ℤ), then 2 is not invertible on S. So take U=Spec(ℤ), but in this case, 𝔾_m(U) is just {1, -1}, so any s here is already a square (1=1^2, -1=(-1)^2=1). Wait, no, (-1)^2 is 1, so -1 is not a square in 𝔾_m(ℤ). Wait, but in ℤ, -1 is a square only if there's x ∈ ℤ with x² = -1, which doesn't exist. So s=-1 in 𝔾_m(ℤ) would not be a square. But in the étale topology, do we have an étale cover where -1 becomes a square? For example, consider the ring ℤ[i]/(i² +1). But ℤ[i] is not étale over ℤ because the derivative of x² +1 is 2x, which is zero mod 2. So maybe adjoining i is not étale. Alternatively, take an étale cover where we invert 2. For instance, take U_i = Spec(ℤ[1/2][x]/(x² +1)). Is this étale over ℤ[1/2]? The derivative is 2x, which is invertible in ℤ[1/2][x]/(x² +1) since x is a root and 2 is invertible. So over ℤ[1/2], this is étale. Then in this cover, x is a square root of -1, so -1 becomes a square. Therefore, s=-1 would become a square in this étale cover. Hmm, but then maybe the original problem is not with s=-1, but with a different s.\n\nAlternatively, take s=2 in some scheme where 2 is a unit. Wait, but if 2 is invertible, then n=2 is invertible, which contradicts the requirement. Wait, the problem is when n is not invertible. So n=2 in S=Spec(ℤ), which is not invertible. Then, we need a scheme U over S and s ∈ 𝔾_m(U) such that there's no étale cover of U where s becomes a square.\n\nBut if U is S itself, then 𝔾_m(S) is {1,-1}. For s=-1, as above, there exists an étale cover where s becomes a square. So maybe that's not the right choice. Alternatively, maybe take U=Spec(ℤ) and s=2. But 2 is not a unit in ℤ, so s=2 is not in 𝔾_m(U). So that's invalid.\n\nWait, maybe take U=Spec(ℤ_p) where p is a prime, but that's a local ring. Alternatively, take U=Spec(ℤ[1/m]) for some m. Suppose we take U=Spec(ℤ[1/6]), so 2 and 3 are invertible. But then n=2 would be invertible there, which is not desired. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider a scheme where s is a unit but n is not invertible. For example, take U=Spec(ℤ[1/3]), so 3 is invertible, but n=2 is not invertible in S=Spec(ℤ), but in U, 2 is not invertible. Then take s=2 in 𝔾_m(U)=ℤ[1/3]^*. But 2 is invertible in U, since we inverted 3, not 2. Wait, no: ℤ[1/3]^* includes units ±1, ±3^k, but 2 is not invertible there. So 2 is not a unit. So s=2 is not in 𝔾_m(U). Hmm.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe a better approach: take S=Spec(ℤ), n=2 (not invertible), and look for U=Spec(ℤ) and s ∈ 𝔾_m(U)={1,-1}. As before, s=-1. We need to check if s is in the image of the map 𝔾_m → 𝔾_m (x ↦ x²) in the étale topology. If there exists an étale cover of U where s lifts, then the sequence is exact, otherwise not. But in this case, as above, we can take an étale cover U_i=Spec(ℤ[i]/(i²+1)) over U=Spec(ℤ). Wait, but is this étale? The ring ℤ[i]/(i²+1) is ℤ[i], which is not étale over ℤ because the derivative of x² +1 is 2x, which is not invertible in ℤ[i]/(i²+1) since 2 is not invertible. So this extension is ramified at 2, hence not étale. So maybe there's no étale cover of U=Spec(ℤ) where -1 becomes a square. Therefore, s=-1 would not be in the image of the map, hence the sequence is not exact. But wait, if that's true, then this is a valid counterexample. The problem is whether there exists an étale cover of Spec(ℤ) where -1 has a square root.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ring ℤ[1/2][x]/(x² +1). This is étale over ℤ[1/2], but not over ℤ. So if we take U=Spec(ℤ[1/2]), then n=2 is invertible in U, which we don't want. So perhaps the correct example is S=Spec(ℤ), n=2, U=Spec(ℤ), s=-1. Then, in the étale topology, to check if s is locally a square. But since any étale cover of Spec(ℤ) would involve rings where 2 is not invertible (because étale maps are unramified, but adding a square root of -1 would require adjoining i, which isn't étale over ℤ). Therefore, in this case, s=-1 is not a square in any étale cover, hence the map is not surjective, so the sequence isn't exact. Hence, this would be the counterexample.\n\nThe user might have tried s=1, which is always a square, so that's why it didn't work. Instead, s=-1 in Spec(ℤ) with n=2 is a better candidate. Therefore, the assumptions would include S=Spec(ℤ), n=2 (not invertible), and s=-1 in 𝔾_m(S). The problem is to show that the sequence isn't exact, i.e., the map 𝔾_m → 𝔾_m given by x ↦ x² isn't surjective in the étale topology, because s=-1 isn't in the image.\n\nSo, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The base scheme $S$ is $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n- $n = 2$, which is not invertible in $\\Gamma(S, \\mathcal{O}_S)$.\n- The section $s = -1$ belongs to $\\mathbb{G}_m(S)$.\n- The étale topology is considered on the category of schemes over $S$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence $$0 \\rightarrow \\mu_{2,S} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{G}_m \\rightarrow \\mathbb{G}_m \\rightarrow 0$$ is not exact in the étale topology by demonstrating that the section $s = -1$ is not in the image of the map $\\mathbb{G}_m \\rightarrow \\mathbb{G}_m$ given by $x \\mapsto x^2$ locally in the étale topology.",
