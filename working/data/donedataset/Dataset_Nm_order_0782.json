    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully. The problem is about proving an infinite series equals π³/(18√2). The series involves hyperbolic sine, regular sine, hyperbolic cosine, and regular cosine terms. \n\nThe example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the current problem, looking at the series sum, the variables are n starting from 1 to infinity. The terms involve functions of πn√2. The problem is to show that the sum equals a specific multiple of π³.\n\nSo, what are the assumptions here? The problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions on n, except that it starts at 1 and goes to infinity. The functions used are standard (sinh, sin, cosh, cos), so maybe the assumptions are about the convergence of the series or the domain of n. But since the problem is to prove the equality, perhaps the key assumptions are that n is a positive integer, which is implied by the summation from n=1 to infinity. Also, since the terms involve πn√2, maybe the value of √2 is exact, and there's no approximation involved. However, the example given in the user's instruction included divisibility conditions, but here there's no such condition. \n\nWait, the original problem's example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in that case, the user added an assumption that wasn't there, but in the example, they filtered it. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions listed were \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. The original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That must have been a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in their example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which actually changes the problem. Maybe that's a typo or an error in the example. \n\nBut regardless, the task is to structure the current problem into the Assumption and Problem sections. For the current problem, the series is from n=1 to infinity. The terms involve sinh, sin, cosh, cos of πn√2. The problem is to show the sum equals π³/(18√2). \n\nSo, possible assumptions here: Each term in the series is defined (which they are, since the denominator cosh(πn√2) - cos(πn√2) is non-zero? Wait, need to check if the denominator could ever be zero. For real numbers, cosh(x) >=1, and cos(x) is between -1 and 1. So cosh(x) - cos(x) >=1 - (-1)=2, so denominator is always at least 2, hence non-zero. Therefore, each term is well-defined. So maybe the assumptions are that n is a positive integer, and the denominator is non-zero. But the non-zero denominator is already ensured by the properties of cosh and cos, so maybe that's not necessary to state. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the series converges. But since the problem is to compute the sum, convergence is implicitly assumed. So the main assumption here is that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1 and goes to infinity). So in the assumptions, I should list that n is a positive integer. But wait, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems incorrect, but maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. However, for the current problem, to follow the format, I need to list each assumption line by line. \n\nLooking at the current problem, the series is from n=1 to infinity. So each term is for n in natural numbers. So the first assumption is that n is a positive integer. Also, the functions sinh, cosh, sin, cos are evaluated at πn√2. So no other assumptions needed. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption: n is a positive integer. Then the problem is to show the sum equals π³/(18√2). \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem was for every integer n. So maybe the example is wrong, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless. \n\nSo in this case, the problem is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question. The original problem is to prove that the sum equals π³/(18√2). The assumptions needed are that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1) and that the denominator is non-zero (though as established, that's always true). However, the user's example included assumptions that were perhaps part of the problem's hidden conditions. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the series converges, but the act of summing from n=1 to infinity already implies convergence. \n\nTherefore, the main assumption here is that n is a positive integer. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac1{n^3}\\frac{\\sinh(\\pi n\\sqrt2)-\\sin(\\pi n\\sqrt2)}{\\cosh(\\pi n\\sqrt2)-\\cos(\\pi n\\sqrt2)}=\\frac{\\pi^3}{18\\sqrt2}$$\n\nWait, looking at the original problem, the user wrote the denominator as {cosh(...)}, which seems like a typo with the curly brace. The original problem's LaTeX might have a typo. Let me check the original question:\n\nOriginal question's problem statement:\n\"Show that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sinh\\big(\\pi n\\sqrt2\\big)-\\sin\\big(\\pi n\\sqrt2\\big)}{n^3\\Big({\\cosh\\big(\\pi n\\sqrt2}\\big)-\\cos\\big(\\pi n\\sqrt2\\big)\\Big)}=\\frac{\\pi^3}{18\\sqrt2}$$\"\n\nI notice that in the denominator, the LaTeX is written as \\Big({\\cosh\\big(\\pi n\\sqrt2}\\big), which has a mismatched brace. It should probably be \\Big(\\cosh\\big(\\pi n\\sqrt2\\big) - \\cos\\big(\\pi n\\sqrt2\\big)\\Big). So there's a typo in the original problem's LaTeX. But when structuring the problem, I need to correct that. So in the formatted problem, the denominator should be properly enclosed. So the correct denominator is \\cosh(\\pi n\\sqrt2) - \\cos(\\pi n\\sqrt2), enclosed in parentheses. Therefore, the problem statement should be written as:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sinh(\\pi n\\sqrt2) - \\sin(\\pi n\\sqrt2)}{n^3 \\left( \\cosh(\\pi n\\sqrt2) - \\cos(\\pi n\\sqrt2) \\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^3}{18\\sqrt2}$$\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be n is a positive integer, and the problem is to show the equality. Since the original problem doesn't state any other conditions, that's the main assumption. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sinh(\\pi n\\sqrt2) - \\sin(\\pi n\\sqrt2)}{n^3 \\left( \\cosh(\\pi n\\sqrt2) - \\cos(\\pi n\\sqrt2) \\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^3}{18\\sqrt2}$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. The key is to list each assumption, even if it's implied by the problem's wording. Since the sum is from n=1 to infinity, n must be a positive integer. Hence, that's the assumption.",
