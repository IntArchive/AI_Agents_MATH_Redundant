    "Content": "Let $X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n$ be i.i.d $\\text{P}(\\lambda)$ random variables where $\\lambda(>0)$ is unknown. Define $$\\bar X=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\qquad,\\qquad S^2=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar X)^2$$ as the sample mean and sample variance respectively. Since $\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ and hence $\\bar X$ is a complete sufficient statistic for $\\lambda$ such that $E(\\bar X)=\\lambda$, $\\bar X$ is the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of $\\lambda$ by the Lehmann-Scheffe theorem.\nAgain, $E(S^2)=\\lambda$, so that $E(S^2\\mid \\bar X)$ is also the UMVUE of $\\lambda$. As UMVUE is unique whenever it exists, it must be that $$E(S^2\\mid \\bar X)=\\bar X$$ The question is: How can I directly show that $E(S^2\\mid \\bar X)=\\bar X$ ? I don't see how to proceed from \\begin{align}\nE(S^2\\mid \\bar X=t)&=E\\left[\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-t)^2\\mid \\bar X=t\\right]\n\\\\&=E\\left[\\frac{1}{n-1}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2-nt^2\\right)\\mid \\bar X=t\\right]\n\\\\&=E\\left[\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2\\mid \\bar X=t\\right]-E\\left[\\frac{nt^2}{n-1}\\mid \\bar X=t\\right]\n\\\\&=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^nE\\left(X_i^2\\mid \\bar X=t\\right)-\\frac{n}{n-1}E(\\bar X^2\\mid \\bar X=t)\\tag{1}\n\\end{align} Any hint would be great. As correctly pointed out by Mike Earnest, the conditional distribution of $(X_1,X_2,\\cdots,X_n)\\mid \\bar X$ is multinomial. That is, for a natural number $k$, $$P\\left(X_1=x_1,\\cdots,X_n=x_n\\mid \\bar X=\\frac{k}{n}\\right)=\\frac{k!}{x_1!\\,x_2!\\cdots x_n!}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{x_1}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{x_2}\\cdots\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{x_n}\\mathbf1_{x_i\\in A}$$ , where $$A=\\left\\{(x_1,\\cdots,x_n)\\in\\{0,1,\\cdots,k\\}: \\sum_{i=1}^nx_i=k\\right\\}$$ From this , we have for each $i$, $$V\\left(X_i\\mid \\bar X=t\\right)=t\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\qquad,\\qquad E\\left(X_i\\mid \\bar X=t\\right)=t$$ And for all $i\\ne j$, $$E\\left(X_iX_j\\mid \\bar X=t\\right)=t\\left(t-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$$ So, \\begin{align}\nE\\left(X_i^2\\mid \\bar X=t\\right)&=V\\left(X_i\\mid \\bar X=t\\right)+\\left[E\\left(X_i\\mid \\bar X=t\\right)\\right]^2\n\\\\&=\\frac{t}{n}(n+nt-1)\n\\end{align} Also, as expected, \\begin{align}\nE\\left(\\bar X^2\\mid \\bar X=t\\right)&=E\\left[\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^nX_iX_j\\mid \\bar X=t\\right]\n\\\\&=\\frac{1}{n}E\\left(X_1^2\\mid \\bar X=t\\right)+\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i\\ne j}E\\left[X_iX_j\\mid \\bar X=t\\right]\n\\\\&=\\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\frac{t}{n}(n-1+nt)+\\frac{2}{n^2}\\binom{n}{2}t\\left(t-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\n\\\\&=t^2\n\\end{align} So from $(1)$ I finally get, \\begin{align}\nE(S^2\\mid \\bar X=t)&=\\frac{n}{n-1}\\cdot\\frac{t}{n}(n+nt-1)-\\frac{n}{n-1}\\cdot t^2\n\\\\&=t\n\\end{align} Hence proved.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the original question. The user wants each assumption to address one property or condition applied to a single object. Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem is about showing that the expected value of the sample variance S² given the sample mean X̄ is equal to X̄ for i.i.d. Poisson random variables. \n\nLooking at the original question, the assumptions include:\n\n1. The random variables X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n2. Each Xᵢ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ, denoted as P(λ).\n3. The parameter λ is positive and unknown.\n4. The sample mean X̄ is defined as (1/n)ΣXᵢ.\n5. The sample variance S² is defined as (1/(n-1))Σ(Xᵢ - X̄)².\n6. The goal is to show E(S² | X̄) = X̄.\n\nWait, some of these might be part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. Let me parse the original problem again.\n\nThe user starts by stating that X₁,...,Xₙ are i.i.d. Poisson(λ) with λ>0 unknown. Then defines X̄ and S². Then mentions that since ΣXᵢ is a complete sufficient statistic, and X̄ is UMVUE, etc. But the actual problem is to show E(S² | X̄) = X̄.\n\nSo the assumptions needed for the problem would be the conditions given in the problem setup. The key assumptions here are:\n\n- The random variables are i.i.d. Poisson(λ).\n- λ is an unknown positive parameter.\n- X̄ is the sample mean.\n- S² is the sample variance as defined.\n\nBut according to the example given, assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\n1. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent.\n2. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are identically distributed.\n3. Each Xᵢ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ.\n4. λ is a positive real number.\n5. λ is unknown.\n6. The sample mean X̄ is defined as (1/n)Σ_{i=1}^n X_i.\n7. The sample variance S² is defined as (1/(n-1))Σ_{i=1}^n (X_i - X̄)^2.\n\nWait, but some of these might be combined. For example, \"i.i.d.\" covers both independent and identically distributed. But according to the example, each assumption is one line, so breaking down i.i.d. into two separate assumptions: independence and identical distribution.\n\nSimilarly, each of the definitions (X̄ and S²) should be separate assumptions. The problem is about showing that the conditional expectation of S² given X̄ equals X̄. So the problem statement is as given.\n\nLet me check the example again. The original example had:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate condition. Here, the conditions are:\n\n- The variables are independent.\n- They are identically distributed.\n- Each is Poisson(λ).\n- λ is positive.\n- λ is unknown.\n- X̄ is defined as the sample mean.\n- S² is defined as the sample variance.\n\nBut maybe the definitions of X̄ and S² are part of the problem setup rather than assumptions? Wait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The original problem in the example had to do with divisibility by 91, but the user had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the problem's setup includes the definitions of X̄ and S², so those would be considered assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the definitions are part of the problem statement. But according to the example, the problem was restated with the expression A(n). So perhaps the definitions are part of the problem.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem. The problem is to show E(S² | X̄) = X̄. So the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- X₁, ..., Xₙ are i.i.d. Poisson(λ) with λ > 0 unknown.\n\nBut to break this down line by line:\n\n1. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent.\n2. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are identically distributed.\n3. Each Xᵢ has a Poisson distribution with parameter λ.\n4. λ is a positive real number.\n5. λ is unknown.\n6. The sample mean is defined as X̄ = (1/n)Σ_{i=1}^n X_i.\n7. The sample variance is defined as S² = [1/(n-1)]Σ_{i=1}^n (X_i - X̄)^2.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. For example, \"X₁,...,Xₙ are i.i.d. Poisson(λ)\" can be split into:\n\n- Independence,\n- Identical distribution,\n- Each follows Poisson(λ).\n\nThen λ is positive and unknown. The definitions of X̄ and S² are separate.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state that λ is unknown as an assumption but as part of the context. However, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions given in the problem.\n\nHence, in this case, the necessary assumptions for the problem \"Show that E(S² | X̄) = X̄\" are the conditions given in the problem statement. The user is to structure the problem by listing all assumptions line by line and then the problem statement.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent.\n2. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are identically distributed.\n3. Each Xᵢ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ.\n4. λ is a positive real number.\n5. The sample mean X̄ is defined as (1/n)Σ_{i=1}^n X_i.\n6. The sample variance S² is defined as (1/(n-1))Σ_{i=1}^n (X_i - X̄)^2.\n\nThe problem is to show that E(S² | X̄) = X̄.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentions that λ is unknown. Is that an assumption? Probably, since if λ were known, the problem might be different. However, in the example, assumptions were specific conditions needed for the problem. Since the problem is about conditional expectation given X̄, the knowledge of λ might not directly impact the proof, but since the Poisson distribution is parameterized by λ, which is unknown, it's part of the model. However, in the proof provided by the user, they use properties of the conditional distribution given X̄, which doesn't rely on λ being known or unknown. So maybe the \"unknown\" part is more related to the statistical context rather than the mathematical assumptions needed for the proof. Therefore, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n1. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent.\n2. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are identically distributed as Poisson(λ).\n3. λ is a positive real number.\n4. X̄ is the sample mean as defined.\n5. S² is the sample variance as defined.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show E(S² | X̄) = X̄. The Poisson assumption is critical here because, for other distributions, this might not hold. So the key assumptions are the i.i.d. Poisson variables. The definitions of X̄ and S² are part of the problem setup. Therefore, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nX₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent,\nX₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are identically distributed,\nEach Xᵢ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ,\nλ is a positive real number,\nThe sample mean is defined as X̄ = (1/n)Σ_{i=1}^n X_i,\nThe sample variance is defined as S² = (1/(n-1))Σ_{i=1}^n (X_i - X̄)^2.\n\nProblem: Show that E(S² | X̄) = X̄.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were more about conditions on the variables rather than definitions. However, the example included the definition of A(n) as part of the problem. So perhaps in this case, the definitions of X̄ and S² are part of the problem statement. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem had the definition of A(n) as part of the problem statement, and the formatted problem included the expression A(n) in the problem. Similarly, here, the problem is to show that E(S² | X̄) = X̄, so the definitions of S² and X̄ are part of the problem statement. However, in the user's example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\", which was a condition, while the problem included the expression. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the definitions of X̄ and S² are part of the problem, not the assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the definition of A(n) was part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. So maybe the definitions here are part of the problem.\n\nWait, the example's formatted problem was:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in that case, the definition of A(n) is part of the problem, not the assumptions. Therefore, in our current problem, the definitions of X̄ and S² would be part of the problem statement. Then the assumptions would be the i.i.d. Poisson variables with λ>0.\n\nBut the original problem mentions that λ is unknown. Is that an assumption? Maybe, because if λ were known, perhaps the approach would differ. But in this case, since the problem is about conditional expectation given X̄, which is a sufficient statistic, the knowledge of λ might be irrelevant once conditioned on X̄. Therefore, maybe the assumption is that λ is a positive real number (since it's a Poisson parameter), but the \"unknown\" part is more about the statistical context rather than a mathematical assumption needed for the proof. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent.\n2. X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are identically distributed.\n3. Each Xᵢ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ.\n4. λ is a positive real number.\n\nAnd the problem is:\n\nShow that $$E(S^2\\mid \\bar X)=\\bar X$$ where $$\\bar X=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$ and $$S^2=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar X)^2.$$\n\nBut according to the example, the problem includes the expression with the definitions. So the problem statement would include the definitions of X̄ and S². Therefore, the assumptions are the i.i.d. Poisson variables with λ>0, and the problem is to show the expectation with the defined X̄ and S².\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are independent,\nX₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ are identically distributed,\nEach Xᵢ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ,\nλ is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$E(S^2\\mid \\bar X)=\\bar X$$ where $$\\bar X=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$ and $$S^2=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar X)^2.$$\n\nAlternatively, maybe the definitions of X̄ and S² should be part of the assumptions since they define the objects involved. However, in the example, the definition of A(n) was part of the problem. Therefore, following the example, the problem statement includes the definitions. Hence, the assumptions are about the variables, and the problem includes the definitions.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would be as above.",
