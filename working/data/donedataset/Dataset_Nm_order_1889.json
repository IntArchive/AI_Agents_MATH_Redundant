    "Content": "This problem is taken from the Kosovo Mathematical Olympiad for Grade-$ 10 $ students. Let $ a $, $ b $ and $ c $ be the lengths of the edges of a given triangle. How can one prove the following inequality? $$\n\\left| \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{b}{c} + \\frac{c}{a} - \\frac{a}{c} - \\frac{b}{a} - \\frac{c}{b} \\right| < 1.\n$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The inequality can be proven very cleanly using a powerful technique known as the Ravi Substitution . Before introducing this technique, let us first give a definition. Definition An ordered triple $ (a,b,c) $ is said to be a triangular triple if and only if $ (a,b,c) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} $ and there exists a triangle whose edges have lengths $ a $, $ b $ and $ c $. The following result says that triangular triples have a particularly nice form. Theorem 1 An ordered triple $ (a,b,c) $ is a triangular triple if and only if there exists $ (x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} $ such that\n  $$\na = x + y, \\quad b = y + z, \\quad c = z + x.\n$$\n  Furthermore, $ x $, $ y $ and $ z $ are unique. The Ravi Substitution is then the act of making the substitutions\n$$\na \\to x + y, \\quad b \\to y + z, \\quad c \\to z + x.\n$$ We are now ready to prove the given inequality, so let $ (a,b,c) $ be a triangular triple. As\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{b}{c} + \\frac{c}{a} - \\frac{a}{c} - \\frac{b}{a} - \\frac{c}{b} \\right| < 1 \\iff \\left| a^{2} c + b^{2} a + c^{2} b - a^{2} b - b^{2} c - c^{2} a \\right| < abc,\n$$\nit suffices to prove the inequality on the right. Applying the Ravi Substitution, we obtain (after some algebraic manipulation, which I shall leave as an exercise)\n$$\na^{2} c + b^{2} a + c^{2} b - a^{2} b - b^{2} c - c^{2} a = -(x - y)(y - z)(z - x).\n$$\nHence,\n\\begin{align}\n  &\\left| a^{2} c + b^{2} a + c^{2} b - a^{2} b - b^{2} c - c^{2} a \\right| \\\\\n= &|-(x - y)(y - z)(z - x)| \\\\\n= &|(x - y)(y - z)(z - x)| \\\\\n= &|x - y||y - z||z - x| \\\\\n< &(|x| + |y|)(|y| + |z|)(|z| + |x|) \\quad (\\text{By the Triangle Inequality.}) \\\\\n= &(x + y)(y + z)(z + x) \\quad (\\text{As $ x,y,z > 0 $.}) \\\\\n= &abc.\n\\end{align} Further Notes on the Ravi Substitution Given $ S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{3} $, we call $ S $ a positive cone in $ \\mathbb{R}^{3} $ if and only if $ S $ is closed under addition, i.e., $ \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\in S \\implies \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y} \\in S $, and scalar multiplication by a positive real number, i.e., $ \\mathbf{x} \\in S, \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\implies \\lambda \\cdot \\mathbf{x} \\in S $. Let $ \\Delta $ denote the set of all triangular triples. Using the Triangle Inequality, it is easy to show that $ \\Delta $ is a positive cone in $ \\mathbb{R}^{3} $. Clearly, $ \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} $ is also a positive cone in $ \\mathbb{R}^{3} $. Next, define a mapping $ \\mathcal{R}: \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3} $ as follows:\n$$\n\\forall (x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}: \\quad \\mathcal{R}(x,y,z) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} (x + y,y + z,z + x).\n$$ Theorem 2 The mapping $ \\mathcal{R} $ is a bijective positively linear transformation from $ \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} $ to $ \\Delta $, i.e., $ \\mathcal{R}: \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} \\to \\Delta $ is a bijection and\n  $$\n\\forall \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}, ~ \\forall \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}: \\quad \\mathcal{R}(\\lambda \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) = \\lambda \\cdot \\mathcal{R}(\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathcal{R}(\\mathbf{y}).\n$$\n  We call $ \\mathcal{R} $ the Ravi Substitution mapping . Theorem 2 thus says that the Ravi Substitution mapping $ \\mathcal{R} $ is an isomorphism of positive cones. Theorem 1 is an immediate consequence. Proof of Theorem 2 : Let $ (x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} $, so $ \\mathcal{R}(x,y,z) = (x + y,y + z,z + x) $. As\n\\begin{align}\n(x + y) + (y + z) &= x + 2y + z > x + z, \\\\\n(x + y) + (z + x) &= 2x + y + z > y + z, \\quad \\text{and} \\\\\n(y + z) + (z + x) &= x + y + 2z > x + y,\n\\end{align}\nthere exists a triangle whose edges have lengths $ x + y $, $ y + z $ and $ z + x $. Hence, $ \\text{Range}(\\mathcal{R}) \\subseteq \\Delta $. If $ (a,b,c) \\in \\Delta $, then by the Triangle Inequality, we have\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{a + c - b}{2},\\frac{b + a - c}{2},\\frac{c + b - a}{2} \\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}.\n$$\nHence, we can define a mapping $ \\mathcal{S}: \\Delta \\to \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} $ as follows:\n$$\n\\forall (a,b,c) \\in \\Delta: \\quad \\mathcal{S}(a,b,c) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\left( \\frac{a + c - b}{2},\\frac{b + a - c}{2},\\frac{c + b - a}{2} \\right).\n$$\nAs $ \\mathcal{R} \\circ \\mathcal{S} = \\text{id}_{\\Delta} $ and $ \\mathcal{S} \\circ \\mathcal{R} = \\text{id}_{\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}} $, we deduce that $ \\mathcal{R}: \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} \\to \\Delta $ is a bijection. The proof that $ \\mathcal{R} $ is a positively linear transformation is not difficult at all, so we leave it to the reader. $ \\quad \\spadesuit $ Suppose now that we have a function $ F: \\Delta \\to \\mathbb{R} $ and are asked to prove\n$$\n\\forall (a,b,c) \\in \\Delta: \\quad F(a,b,c) \\geq 0.\n$$\nBy Theorem 2, this is equivalent to proving\n$$\n\\forall (x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}: \\quad F(\\mathcal{R}(x,y,z)) = F(x + y,y + z,z + x) \\geq 0.\n$$\nThe reason why the second statement may be easier to prove than the first one is that $ \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} $ is easier to handle than $ \\Delta $. (Do you find it easy to visualize $ \\Delta $ in $ 3 $-space? I do not.) Many inequalities involving three variables, such as the three-variable version of the AM-GM Inequality, are tailor-made for $ \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} $, so applying the Ravi Substitution mapping usually simplifies matters considerably as we may then use these inequalities directly.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem correctly according to the user's format. The original problem is about proving an inequality involving the side lengths of a triangle. The question is from the Kosovo Mathematical Olympiad for Grade 10 students, so the assumptions should relate to the triangle's side lengths.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The user specified that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. The problem mentions that a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a given triangle. So the primary assumption here is that a, b, c are positive real numbers forming a triangle. But wait, in a triangle, the sides must satisfy the triangle inequalities. Each side must be less than the sum of the other two. However, the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention that, it just says they are the lengths of the edges of a given triangle. So perhaps the key assumptions are that a, b, c are positive real numbers, and each of them satisfies the triangle inequality. But since the problem is about a triangle, we can assume that all the triangle inequalities hold. However, in the example provided, the user only listed the essential conditions. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about a triangle, so the main assumptions are that a, b, c are positive real numbers (since lengths can't be negative or zero) and that they satisfy the triangle inequalities. But how to break that down into individual assumptions? Each triangle inequality is a separate condition. For a triangle with sides a, b, c, the triangle inequalities are:\n\n1. a + b > c\n2. a + c > b\n3. b + c > a\n\nBut maybe the user expects each assumption to be listed as one per line. So each of these three inequalities would be separate assumptions. However, the original problem statement doesn't explicitly mention these; it just says a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a given triangle. So perhaps the assumption is that a, b, c are the sides of a triangle, which inherently includes those three inequalities. But according to the user's example, they might want each individual condition. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory because the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7 as a condition. Maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Hmm, but regardless, the task is to structure the problem given here. The current problem is about a triangle with sides a, b, c. The question is to prove the inequality involving the absolute value of that expression being less than 1. So the key assumptions are that a, b, c are positive real numbers forming a triangle. But since the triangle has sides, they must satisfy the triangle inequalities. So perhaps each triangle inequality is a separate assumption. Alternatively, since the problem states \"the lengths of the edges of a given triangle\", maybe the only assumption needed is that a, b, c are the sides of a triangle, which automatically includes all three triangle inequalities. However, the user's example broke down the assumptions into separate lines, even if they are related. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user modified the problem? Because in the original problem, there was no restriction that n is divisible by 7. So maybe the example was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had some hidden condition. But in this case, the problem given is straightforward: a, b, c are the sides of a triangle, so the assumptions are that they are positive and satisfy the triangle inequalities. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe list each triangle inequality as separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are positive real numbers,\na + b > c,\na + c > b,\nb + c > a.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement already implies that a, b, c are sides of a triangle, so maybe the first assumption is \"a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a triangle\", which inherently includes the three triangle inequalities. But the user's example listed each assumption separately. For example, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to list all conditions explicitly, even if some are redundant. However, in the original problem given here, the only explicit condition is that a, b, c are the sides of a triangle. Therefore, the assumption should be that a, b, c are positive real numbers satisfying the triangle inequalities. However, according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps break it down into:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\nc is a positive real number,\na + b > c,\na + c > b,\nb + c > a.\n\nBut maybe that's too granular. Alternatively, the problem statement says \"a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a given triangle\", which already implies all the above. So maybe the main assumption is that a, b, c are the side lengths of a triangle. But according to the user's example, they might expect each condition to be listed individually. But in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it as an assumption, which seems incorrect. Perhaps the example had a mistake. Regardless, for the current problem, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is to prove the inequality |expression| < 1 given that a, b, c are the sides of a triangle. The key assumptions are that a, b, c are positive and satisfy the triangle inequalities. Therefore, I think the correct way is to list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\nc is a positive real number,\na, b, c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle.\n\nWait, but the fact that a, b, c are the sides of a triangle already implies they are positive and satisfy the triangle inequalities. So maybe just state that a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a triangle. However, the user's example broke down the assumptions into separate lines. For example, in the example, the problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems like an error, unless the original problem had a different condition. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91\". But the user wrote that the original problem was \"for every integer n\". So maybe there was a mistake. Anyway, the current problem is that a, b, c are the sides of a triangle. So the assumptions should be that a, b, c are positive real numbers forming a triangle. But to follow the user's example, maybe list each triangle inequality. But perhaps the user prefers to list the key conditions. Alternatively, if the problem just says \"a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a given triangle\", then maybe the only assumption needed is that a, b, c are the sides of a triangle. However, in mathematical problems, when they say \"lengths of the edges of a triangle\", it's implicit that they are positive and satisfy the triangle inequalities. Therefore, the formatted assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a triangle.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So if \"a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a triangle\" is a single assumption, but it actually includes multiple conditions (positivity and triangle inequalities), then perhaps we need to break it down. However, the example given by the user combined multiple properties into one assumption (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7), but each was a separate line. Wait, in the example, the formatted problem's assumptions were:\n\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each line is a separate assumption. Therefore, for the current problem, perhaps each of the triangle inequalities should be separate assumptions. But the original problem statement doesn't mention them explicitly. The problem just says \"a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a given triangle\". Therefore, to follow the user's example, perhaps the main assumption is that a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a triangle, which includes all necessary conditions. However, to break it down into individual properties, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\nc is a positive real number,\na + b > c,\na + c > b,\nb + c > a.\n\nBut maybe that's too detailed. The original problem says \"lengths of the edges of a given triangle\", which already implies all these. However, to comply with the user's instruction of each assumption being one property per line, I think breaking it down into positivity and triangle inequalities is better. Alternatively, if the problem is from an Olympiad, the participants are expected to know that triangle sides are positive and satisfy the triangle inequalities, so maybe the only assumption needed is that a, b, c are the sides of a triangle. But the user's example seems to list each condition separately, even if redundant. For example, in the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps the user wants to list all the necessary conditions explicitly, even if some are implied by others. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nb is a positive real number,\nc is a positive real number,\na + b > c,\na + c > b,\nb + c > a.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the inequality, and these are the necessary conditions. However, in the original problem statement, it's given that a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a triangle, which already includes all these assumptions. So perhaps the correct approach is to list each of these as separate assumptions. Alternatively, if the user's example combined multiple into one line, but here we have to split them. In the example, the user listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each is a separate line. Similarly, here, the assumptions are that a, b, c are positive (each as a separate line) and that each pair sums to more than the third. But positivity is for each variable. However, in the problem statement, it's given that they are lengths of edges of a triangle, which implies positivity. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are the lengths of the edges of a triangle.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, each assumption should be a single property. If \"lengths of edges of a triangle\" is considered one property, then it's one line. However, the example shows that even if multiple properties are implied, they are listed separately. For instance, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Which suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, or that the original problem was different. Regardless, for the current problem, I need to follow the user's instruction. Given that the example breaks down assumptions into individual conditions, even if overlapping, I think the correct way here is to list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are positive real numbers,\na + b > c,\na + c > b,\nb + c > a.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition, each applied to the relevant objects. Thus, the problem is to prove the inequality given these assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions listed line by line, and then the problem statement.",
