    "Content": "We want to prove that a group, say $G$, of order $pqr$ where $p \\gt q \\gt r$ has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup and deduce that it has a normal subgroup of order $pq$. I know how to show $G$ has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup or normal Sylow $q$-subgroup, but not the rest. Thanks for your advices.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You know that $G$ has a normal subgroup $N$ of order $p$ or $q$. Suppose $|N| = p$, then you are done, so suppose $|N| = q$. Consider the group $G/N$ which has order $pr$. By Cauchy's theorem, $G/N$ has a subgroup $K$ of order $p$. Since this group has index $r$, which is the smallest prime dividing $|G/N|$, $K \\triangleleft G/N$. Now, let $\\pi : G \\to G/N$ be the natural quotient map, then $H := \\pi^{-1}(K)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ which has order $|K||N| = pq$. As before, $H$ has a normal subgroup $P$ of order $p$. Now I claim that $P \\triangleleft G$. Suppose $g \\in G$, then $gHg^{-1} \\subset H$. Hence,\n$$\ngPg^{-1} < H\n$$\nSo, $gPg^{-1}$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $H$. But $P$ is the unique $p-$Sylow subgroup of $H$. Hence,\n$$\ngPg^{-1} = P \\quad\\forall g \\in G\n$$\nHence, $P \\triangleleft G$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the task is to prove that a group G of order pqr, where p > q > r are primes, has a normal Sylow p-subgroup and then deduce that it has a normal subgroup of order pq. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that Sylow theorems are key here. The Sylow theorems give us information about the number of Sylow p-subgroups, which relates to the group's structure. Let me recall the third Sylow theorem: the number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted n_p, divides the order of the group divided by p, and is congruent to 1 mod p. In this case, the group order is pqr, so n_p must divide qr and n_p ≡ 1 mod p.\n\nSince p > q > r, all primes are distinct. Let's start with the Sylow p-subgroup. The number of Sylow p-subgroups n_p must satisfy n_p | qr and n_p ≡ 1 mod p. The divisors of qr are 1, q, r, qr. But since p is the largest prime, and q and r are smaller than p, then qr < p if both q and r are multiplied? Wait, no. For example, if p=5, q=3, r=2, then qr=6, which is greater than p=5. Wait, but in that case, n_p must divide 6 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible n_p could be 1 or 6. But 6 mod 5 is 1, so n_p could be 1 or 6. However, if n_p=6, then 6 ≡ 1 mod 5, which is true. Wait, but 6 mod 5 is 1, so yes. But in that case, n_p could be 1 or 6. Hmm, so maybe this approach isn't sufficient? Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says they know how to show that G has a normal Sylow p-subgroup or normal Sylow q-subgroup. So maybe there's a standard approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to use the fact that the smallest prime divisor of the group order is r, but p is the largest. Wait, maybe we can use the Sylow theorems for each prime and show that one of the Sylow subgroups is normal.\n\nLet me think again. For the Sylow p-subgroup, n_p divides qr and n_p ≡ 1 mod p. Since p > q > r, then qr is less than p^2, but not necessarily. For instance, if p=5, q=3, r=2, qr=6 < 5^2=25. But if p=7, q=5, r=3, qr=15 < 49. So in general, qr < p^2. Now, the possible n_p is 1, q, r, qr. But since n_p ≡1 mod p, and p is the largest prime, q and r are both less than p. Therefore, q ≡ q mod p, which is less than p, so q mod p = q. Similarly for r. So q ≡1 mod p would require q = 1 + kp, but since q < p, this is impossible unless k=0, which would mean q=1, which is not a prime. Similarly, r ≡1 mod p is impossible. Then qr ≡ (q)(r) mod p. Since q and r are both less than p, their product is less than p^2, but we need qr ≡1 mod p. However, unless qr = 1 mod p, which would require that qr -1 is divisible by p. But since p is larger than both q and r, it's not clear if that's possible. However, unless such a combination exists, but the problem states that for any primes p > q > r, the group of order pqr has a normal Sylow p-subgroup. Therefore, n_p must be 1, because if n_p=1, then the Sylow p-subgroup is unique and hence normal. If n_p is not 1, then it would have to be q, r, or qr. But since q and r are less than p, and n_p ≡1 mod p, the only possibility is n_p=1. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, for n_p ≡1 mod p, and n_p divides qr. So n_p can be 1, q, r, or qr. But n_p ≡1 mod p. If n_p= q, then q ≡1 mod p. But since p > q, q ≡1 mod p implies q=1, which is impossible. Similarly, if n_p=r, then r ≡1 mod p, which also implies r=1, impossible. If n_p=qr, then qr ≡1 mod p. But since q and r are both less than p, their product qr is less than p^2, but qr ≡1 mod p implies that qr = kp +1 for some integer k. However, since qr < p^2, then kp +1 < p^2, so k < p. But qr = kp +1. Now, since p is the largest prime, and q and r are smaller, maybe this equation is possible for some k, but generally, for arbitrary primes p > q > r, this would not hold. Therefore, the only possible value for n_p that satisfies n_p ≡1 mod p and divides qr is n_p=1. Therefore, the Sylow p-subgroup is unique, hence normal. That seems to be the argument.\n\nSo then, the first part is proven: G has a normal Sylow p-subgroup, say P. Now, we need to deduce that G has a normal subgroup of order pq. Since P is normal of order p, and we want a subgroup of order pq. Maybe we can take the product of P with a Sylow q-subgroup?\n\nBut Sylow q-subgroups may not be normal. Wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that G/P is a group of order qr. Since P is normal, G/P is a group of order qr. Now, in G/P, the Sylow q-subgroups have order q, and Sylow r-subgroups have order r. Since q > r, applying similar logic, perhaps the Sylow q-subgroup of G/P is normal. Let's see: the number of Sylow q-subgroups in G/P, which has order qr, would be n_q such that n_q divides r and n_q ≡1 mod q. Since r < q, the only divisors of r are 1 and r. If n_q=1, then Sylow q-subgroup is normal. If n_q=r, then r ≡1 mod q. But r < q, so r ≡1 mod q implies r=1, which is impossible. Hence, n_q=1, so G/P has a unique Sylow q-subgroup, which is normal. Therefore, G/P has a normal subgroup of order q, which corresponds to a normal subgroup of G containing P, of order p*q. Therefore, this would be the desired normal subgroup of order pq.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more direct way. Since P is normal in G, and if Q is a Sylow q-subgroup, then PQ is a subgroup of G, since P is normal. The order of PQ is |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q|. But since P has order p and Q has order q, and p and q are distinct primes, their intersection is trivial. Hence, |PQ|=p*q. Since PQ is a subgroup of order pq, and since P is normal, maybe PQ is normal in G? Wait, not necessarily. But if we can show that PQ is normal in G, then that would be the desired subgroup.\n\nAlternatively, since G has a normal Sylow p-subgroup P, and then consider the quotient group G/P, which has order qr. As above, G/P has a normal Sylow q-subgroup, which corresponds to a normal subgroup of G containing P with order p*q. Therefore, that subgroup is normal in G and has order pq. Thus, the deduction is made.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions would be that G is a group of order pqr where p, q, r are primes with p > q > r. Then the problem is to prove that G has a normal Sylow p-subgroup and deduce that it has a normal subgroup of order pq.",
