    "Content": "Could you please confirm if this proof is correct? Theorem: If $q \\neq 0$ is rational and $y$ is irrational, then $qy$ is irrational. Proof: Proof by contradiction, we assume that $qy$ is rational. Therefore $qy=\\frac{a}{b}$ for integers $a$, $b \\neq 0$. Since $q$ is rational, we have $\\frac{x}{z}y=\\frac{a}{b}$ for integers $x \\neq 0$, $z \\neq 0$. Therefore, $xy = a$, and $y=\\frac{a}{x}$. Since both $a$ and $x$ are integers, $y$ is rational, leading to a contradiction.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It's wrong.  You wrote $\\frac{x}{z}y = \\frac{a}{b}$.  That is correct.  Then you said \"Therefore $xy = a$.  That is wrong. You need to solve $\\frac{x}{z}y = \\frac{a}{b}$ for $y$.  You get $y = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{z}{x}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and the problem. The original question here is about proving that the product of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is irrational. The user wants me to filter out unrelated information and present it in the specified format.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that q is a non-zero rational number, and y is irrational. The proof is by contradiction. But the assumptions should only list the given conditions, not the proof steps. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. q is a rational number.\n2. q is not equal to zero.\n3. y is an irrational number.\n\nEach assumption is about one property of a single object. The problem is to prove that the product qy is irrational. The original question includes a proof attempt, but for the formatted problem, I just need to state the problem without the proof details.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are the three points above, and the problem is to prove that qy is irrational. I should check if the example given by the user matches this structure. In their example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, similar structure: each assumption is a separate condition on each object involved. Therefore, the formatted problem should list each assumption line by line and then the problem statement.",
