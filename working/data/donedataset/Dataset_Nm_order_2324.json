    "Content": "Proposition . Let $G,H$ be finite groups (abelian or not). Then the following implication holds: $$G\\times G\\cong H\\times H \\Rightarrow G\\cong H.$$ In the case of $G,H$ both abelian, one can use the structure theorem (by looking at the invariant factors). Otherwise, I found an argument here , which is a bit unclear to me. I will rephrase it in this post: Lemma . For a finite group $G$ , the map ${\\rm FinGr}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}, A\\rightarrow |\\text{Hom}(A, G)|$ (i.e. $A$ goes to the number of group homomorphisms from $A$ to $G$ ) uniquely determines $G$ , up to isomorphism. Or equivalently, if $G_1$ and $G_2$ are two finite groups, such that for any finite group $A$ we have: $|\\text{Hom}(A, G_1)|=|\\text{Hom}(A, G_2)|$ , then $G_1\\cong G_2$ . Proof proposition : From $G\\times G\\cong H\\times H$ we get $|\\text{Hom}(A, G\\times G)|=|\\text{Hom}(A, H\\times H)|$ , for any finite group $A$ . From the universal property of the direct product, we have: $|\\text{Hom}(L, K\\times K)|=|\\text{Hom}(L, K)|^2$ , for any groups $L,K$ . We conclude that: $|\\text{Hom}(A, G)|=|\\text{Hom}(A, H)|$ for any finite group $A$ . Using the previous lemma, we get the desired conclusion. My question is: how do we prove this lemma? I tried some particular cases of $A$ , cyclic, simple, but it doesn't bring much into light. ( EDIT : My fault, I overlooked an answer to the lemma here , which is not trivial and I still have hard time understanding it). Anyway, if you have a more ellegant/elementary approach to the original proposition, you are more than welcome to share it. Thank you in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\newcommand{\\Hom}{\\text{Hom}}\\newcommand{\\Surj}{\\text{Surj}}$ I disagree with Arturo's comment: Proving this lemma is much easier than proving the Krull-Schmidt theorem! Most of the work is already in the linked question but, since you have trouble understanding the answers to the linked question, and since they are to a slightly different question ( $|\\Hom(H, G_1)| = |\\Hom(H, G_2)|$ instead of $|\\Hom(G_1, H)| = |\\Hom(G_2, H)|$ ), I'll say some more. For any two groups $G$ and $H$ , let $\\Surj(G,H)$ be the set of surjective group homomorphisms $G \\to H$ . Now, suppose that $G_1$ and $G_2$ are finite groups such that $|\\Hom(G_1, H)| = |\\Hom(G_2, H)|$ for all $H$ . I claim that we also have $|\\Surj(G_1, H)| = |\\Surj(G_2, H)|$ . Proof of claim: By induction on $|H|$ ; the base case of the trivial group is obvious. Since every homomorphism $G_i \\to H$ has as image some unique subgroup $H'$ of $G$ , we have $$|\\Hom(G_i, H)| = \\sum_{H' \\subseteq H} |\\Surj(G_i, H')|.$$ So, if $|\\Surj(G_1, H')| = |\\Surj(G_2, H')|$ for all $|H'| < |H|$ , and $|\\Hom(G_1, H)| = |\\Hom(G_2, H)|$ , we deduce that $|\\Surj(G_1, H)| = |\\Surj(G_2, H)|$ . $\\square$ In particular, $|\\Surj(G_1, G_1)| \\geq 1$ , so we deduce that there is a surjection $G_1 \\to G_2$ . Similarly, there is a surjection $G_2 \\to G_1$ . So, since $G_1$ and $G_2$ are finite, this means that we must have $G_1 \\cong G_2$ . $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that if G and H are finite groups such that G×G is isomorphic to H×H, then G is isomorphic to H. The user mentions that for abelian groups, the structure theorem can be used, but the non-abelian case uses a lemma about homomorphism counts. The main problem is proving this lemma, though the user also asks for alternative approaches.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So here, the key assumptions are that G and H are finite groups, and that their products are isomorphic. The problem is to show that G and H themselves are isomorphic.\n\nWait, the original proposition states that G and H are finite groups (abelian or not), and the implication is that G×G ≅ H×H implies G ≅ H. The assumptions here would be that G and H are finite groups, and that G×G is isomorphic to H×H. The problem is to prove that G is isomorphic to H under these conditions.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single property per line. So:\n\nAssumption: G is a finite group,\nAssumption: H is a finite group,\nAssumption: G × G is isomorphic to H × H.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is isomorphic to H.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the user didn't specify any additional conditions beyond G and H being finite and their product being isomorphic. So the assumptions should just be those three points.\n\nThe user's question also mentions the lemma about homomorphism counts determining the group up to isomorphism, but that's part of their approach. However, when structuring the problem, I should focus only on the original proposition they're asking about, not the lemma. The user's main problem is the proposition, and their specific question is about proving the lemma used in the argument. But according to the example, the formatted problem should capture the main problem they need to solve. Wait, the user's original post's title is \"If G,H are finite groups, then G×G≅H×H implies G≅H\". The problem they want to solve is this proposition. The lemma about homomorphisms is part of their attempted proof. So in the formatted problem, the problem part should be the proposition, and the assumptions are the conditions given in the proposition.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are that G and H are finite groups (without specifying abelian, since the proposition states \"abelian or not\"), and that G×G is isomorphic to H×H. The problem is to prove G ≅ H.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumption: G is a finite group,\nAssumption: H is a finite group,\nAssumption: G × G is isomorphic to H × H.\nProblem: Prove that G is isomorphic to H.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property per object. The problem is the conclusion to be drawn from those assumptions.",
