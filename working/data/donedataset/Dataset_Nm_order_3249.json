    "Content": "Let $a_0,a_1>0$ be given. Consider the recursive sequence\n$$a_{n+2}=\\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}+\\frac{1}{a_n}$$\nProve that $a_n\\to\\sqrt2$. I attempted to find a bound for $a_n$ but so far I have only got $a_n>0$. Somebody hints that I might want to use limsup/liminf, but I want to at least put a bound on them first. Aside from limsup/liminf (which I don't know how to make use of here yet), is there any other method? That, if possible, will be preferable for me since I'm not very used to limsup/liminf. Or, can we prove that this second-order recursion is stable in some way? Thanks in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For those who are interested, one can solve this using $\\liminf$, $\\limsup$ (So this does not quite meet the OP's requirement). The idea is described in another answer linked in the comment. First of all one can show that $a_n$ is bounded . Let \n$$\\ell = \\liminf_{n\\to \\infty} a_n, \\ \\ L = \\limsup_{n\\to \\infty} a_n.$$ By the definition of $\\ell$, one can find a subsequence $\\{a_{n_k}\\}$ so that $a_{n_k} \\to \\ell$. By picking a subsequence, we also assume that $$a_{n_k - 1} \\to \\ell_1,\\ \\ a_{n_k  -2} \\to \\ell_2\\ \\ \\ \\text{as }k\\to \\infty.$$ Then taking $k\\to \\infty$ of $$a_{n_k} = \\frac{1}{a_{n_k-1}} + \\frac{1}{a_{n_k-2}},$$ we have $$\\ell = \\frac{1}{\\ell_1 } + \\frac{1}{\\ell_2} \\ge \\frac{1}{L} + \\frac{1}{L} = \\frac{2}{L} \\Rightarrow \\ell L \\ge 2$$ Similarly by taking a subsequence going to $L$, we have $\\ell L \\le 2$. Thus $\\ell L = 2$. Now we show that $\\ell =L =\\sqrt 2$. Then this implies $a_n \\to \\sqrt 2$ as $n\\to \\infty$. Similarly, let $a_{n_k}$ converges to $L$ and $a_{n_k-1} \\to \\ell_1$,  $a_{n_k -2} \\to \\ell_2$ and $a_{n_k - 3} \\to \\ell_3$. Then we have $$\\frac {2}{\\ell} = L = \\frac{1}{\\ell_1} + \\frac{1}{\\ell_2}$$ and $$\\ell_1 = \\frac{1}{\\ell_2} + \\frac{1}{\\ell_3}.$$ The first equality actually forces $\\ell_1 = \\ell_2 = \\ell$. Put this into the second equality gives $$\\frac{2}{L} = \\ell = \\frac{1}{\\ell } + \\frac{1}{\\ell_3}.$$ This again forces $\\ell = \\ell_3 = L$. Thus $\\ell = L = \\sqrt 2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the original problem.\n\nThe original problem states: Let $a_0, a_1 > 0$ be given. The recursive sequence is defined as $a_{n+2} = \\frac{1}{a_{n+1}} + \\frac{1}{a_n}$. We need to prove that $a_n \\to \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are that $a_0$ and $a_1$ are positive real numbers. The recursion formula is given, but since the format requires each assumption to address only one property applied to one object, I should list each initial condition separately. Also, the recursion itself is another assumption. However, the problem mentions that the user attempted to find bounds and only established $a_n > 0$, but in the problem statement, the initial terms are given as positive, so the positivity of all terms might be an implicit assumption here. Wait, but the problem doesn't explicitly state that all $a_n$ are positive, but given the recursion, if $a_0, a_1 >0$, then each subsequent term is a sum of reciprocals of positive terms, hence positive. So maybe the positivity of all terms is a derived property, not an assumption. But the user's attempt mentions they found $a_n >0$, so perhaps that's part of the problem's conditions. Hmm, the original problem states \"Let $a_0, a_1 >0$ be given.\" So those are the initial conditions. The recursion is defined as $a_{n+2} = 1/a_{n+1} + 1/a_n$. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. $a_0$ is a positive real number.\n2. $a_1$ is a positive real number.\n3. The sequence is defined by the recursion $a_{n+2} = \\frac{1}{a_{n+1}} + \\frac{1}{a_n}$ for all $n \\geq 0$.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated doesn't mention any other conditions, like specific values for $a_0$ and $a_1$ other than being positive. So the key assumptions are the initial positivity and the recursion formula. The problem then asks to prove that the sequence converges to sqrt(2).\n\nNow, in the example provided, the assumption included that $n$ is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. In this case, the original problem doesn't have any divisibility conditions, just the initial terms being positive and the recursion. So I need to list each of these as separate assumptions. Also, each assumption should apply to one object. So $a_0$ and $a_1$ being positive are separate assumptions. Then the recursion is another assumption. So the assumptions are:\n\n- $a_0$ is a positive real number.\n- $a_1$ is a positive real number.\n- For all $n \\geq 0$, $a_{n+2} = \\frac{1}{a_{n+1}} + \\frac{1}{a_n}$.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction had each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property of one object. So for example, in the example, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions, even though both are about $n$. So following that, here, $a_0$ being positive and $a_1$ being positive are two separate assumptions. Then the recursion is a third assumption. So that's three lines under \"Assumption:\".\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that $a_n$ converges to $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The user mentions they found $a_n >0$, but that's derived from the initial conditions and the recursion, so it's not an assumption but a consequence. The original problem doesn't state any other conditions, so the three assumptions I listed should be sufficient.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$a_0$ is a positive real number,\n$a_1$ is a positive real number,\nFor all $n \\geq 0$, $a_{n+2} = \\frac{1}{a_{n+1}} + \\frac{1}{a_n}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $a_n \\to \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line and addresses one property. The recursion applies to all $n \\geq 0$, so that's a single condition about the sequence's definition. Yes, this seems correct.",
