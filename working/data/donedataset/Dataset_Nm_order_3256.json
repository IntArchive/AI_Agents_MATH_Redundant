    "Content": "Source: Stewart. Calculus: Early Transcendentals (6 edn 2007) . p. 1068. §16.5, Exercise #27. $\\nabla \\cdot \\color{green}{(\\mathbf{F} {\\times} \\mathbf{G})} = \\partial_h\\color{green}{\\epsilon_{hij}F_iG_j}$ $ = \\epsilon_{hij}\\partial_h[F_iG_j]$ $ = \\color{purple}{\\epsilon_{hij}G_j\\partial_hF_i} \\color{red}{+} \\epsilon_{hij}F_i\\partial_hG_j $ $\\color{purple}{1. \\text{How do I determine whether } \\epsilon_{hij}G_j\\partial_hF_i =   \\mathbf{G} \\times \\nabla \\mathbf{F} \\text{ or } \\mathbf{G} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}) ?}$ $\\color{darkred}{\\text{3. The answer shows a negative sign $-$, not +. What did I miss?}}$ I read this . My guess One answer to my question 1 is that the divergence of a vector field, ie $\\nabla \\mathbf{F}$ , is always a scalar. So taking its cross product is nonsensical. This is why $ \\color{purple}{ \\mathbf{G} \\times \\nabla \\mathbf{F} } $ is wrong. First Attempt Recanted due to celtschk's Answer: I tried to compute $\\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{F} \\times \\mathbf{G})$ by considering the $j$ th component term in the sum of the divergence operator: $\\color{red}{[}\\nabla \\cdot \\color{green}{(\\mathbf{F} {\\times} \\mathbf{G})}\\color{red}{]}_\\color{red}{\\LARGE{j}} = \\partial_\\color{red}{\\LARGE{j}}{\\epsilon_{hi\\color{red}{\\LARGE{j}}}}F_{\\huge{\\color{green}{i}}}G_{\\huge{\\color{green}{i}}} = \\color{green}{\\epsilon_{hi\\color{red}{\\LARGE{j}}}}\\partial_\\color{red}{\\LARGE{j}}[F_{\\huge{\\color{green}{i}}}G_{\\huge{\\color{green}{i}}}] = \\color{purple}{\\epsilon_{hi\\color{red}{\\LARGE{j}}}G_i\\partial_\\color{red}{\\LARGE{j}}F_i} \\color{brown}{+} \\color{gray}{\\epsilon_{hi\\color{red}{\\LARGE{j}}}F_i\\partial_\\color{red}{\\LARGE{j}}G_i} $ Supplement due to Muphrid and celtschk: $1.1.$ Without geometric calculus or wedge products or any more advanced topics, how can I  divine to move $G_h$ to the front, as Muphrid did? $3.1.$ In $\\color{purple}{F_i\\partial_hG_j}$ , the order of the subscripts is $\\color{purple}{(i, h, j)}$ But in $\\epsilon_{hij}$ , the order is $(h, i, j)$ . Thus, I must rotate $(h, i, j)$ to obtain $\\color{purple}{(i, h, j)},$ by swapping $\\color{purple}{h}$ and $\\color{purple}{i}$ once $\\Longrightarrow \\epsilon_{hij} = -\\epsilon_{\\color{purple}{ihj}} $ . This yields the required answer. Must [the order of the subscripts of the components] = [the order of the subscripts in the Levi-Civita symbol]? Why does this work? Supplement due to Muphrid's Comment on July 17th: $3.2.$ How can I divine to pull $G_j$ to the front, and NOT the back? You did: $\\color{purple}{\\epsilon_{hij}G_j\\partial_hF_i} = \\color{purple}{(\\epsilon_{hij}\\partial_hF_i)G_j} = \\color{purple}{G_j\\epsilon_{\\color{magenta}{jhi}}\\partial_hF_i = \\mathbf{G} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F})}. $ I would've computed: $\\color{purple}{\\epsilon_{hij}G_j\\partial_hF_i} = \\color{purple}{(\\epsilon_{hij}\\partial_hF_i)G_j = (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}) \\cdot \\mathbf{G}. \\text{ But this is wrong! }}$ Supplement due to celtschk & Muphrid's Comments on July 22nd From celtschk: It is also not strictly required that the order of indices maps the order in the vector expression. However it helps to do that because it's less error prone... From Muphrid: Yes, the order of indices in the Levi-Civita matters... $3.3. $ Don't these two comments contradict? Must [the order of the subscripts of the components] = [the order of the subscripts in the Levi-Civita symbol] ? $3.4.$ Ought the order for both match? Why or why not?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are contracting the indices of $\\mathbf F$ and $\\mathbf G$ with each other; In $\\mathbf G\\cdot(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf F)$ you'd contract it with the remaining index of $\\epsilon$ (the indices of $\\mathbf F$ and $\\nabla$ are already contracted). However $\\mathbf G\\times\\nabla \\mathbf F$ does not make sense to me. $\\partial_jF_i$ are the components of a rank-2 tensor; it might make sense to write that tensor as $\\nabla\\mathbf F$. However what doesn't make sense to me is to take the cross product. Looking closer to the expression, I notice that it doesn't make sense in index notation either because there are three occurrences of the index $i$ in the product; only one (free index) or two (summed index) are possible. I don't see a difference to your first question. Just the roles of $\\mathbf F$ and $\\mathbf G$ are exchanged. Your very first step is already wrong. You can easily see that by the fact that on the left hand side, $j$ is a free index, while on the right hand side, it is summed over (it appears twice in a product). A second mistake is the index $h$ which doesn't even appear on the LHS. A third mistake is the three occurrences of the index $i$. Actually, I now even notice that your \"zeroth\" step also is wrong: The expression you are taking the $j$-th component from is a scalar, and therefore doesn't have a $j$-th component. (And yes, the index $j$ does mean the j-th component; anyway, considering the $j$-th term in isolation wouldn't make too much sense anyway). Edit for 3.1 and 3.2: Unless there's a derivative, which would determine the order. This is explained in the paragraph before \"edit for 3.3 and 3.4\". But otherwise, No, it is not required that $\\text{[the order of the indices in the Levi-Civita symbol]}$ $= \\text{[the order of the components in the component expression].}$ After all, they are just scalar factors (unless there's a derivative). It is also not strictly required that [the order of indices in the Levi-Civita Symbol] maps the order in the vector expression. However it helps to do that because it's less error prone. What definitely matters is whether such a permutation is even or odd; this corresponds to the cross product being antisymmetric. Putting the indices in the \"right\" order before conversion definitely helps with making no errors. The second term in your 3rd equation is $\\epsilon_{hij}F_i\\partial_hG_j$. Since you have a derivative here, you have the additional constraint that the derivative has to come in front of what it derives, which in an expression of the form $\\mathbf a\\cdot(\\mathbf b\\times\\mathbf c)$ can only happen if $\\mathbf b$ is the derivative, and $\\mathbf c$ is what is derived. Therefore you want the index of $\\partial$ second, and the index of $G$ third, so that those two appear in the vector product in exactly that way. That is, you want $\\epsilon_{ihj}$ which you indeed get by exchanging $h$ and $i$, and therefore you get the sign change. Edit for 3.3 and 3.4: The order of the indices in the epsilon tensor matters , because reordering may change the sign. However, for permutations without a sign change (ie even ones), this order of the indices can change without affecting the final answer. Moreover, since the cross product is NOT commutative but the dot product is, thus in the vector expression, only the order of the vectors in the cross product matters, not the order in the dot product. The order of the components in  component form doesn't matter (except for derivative operators, of course). This means you can exchange the $A_i$, $B_j$ and $C_k$ any way you like (making sure you keep the correct index on each, of course) without changing the value:\n$$\\epsilon_{ijk}A_iB_jC_k = \\epsilon_{ijk}B_jA_iC_k = \\epsilon_{ijk}B_jC_kA_i = \\dots$$ Now if the order fits everywhere, then there are two possibilities for interpreting $\\epsilon_{ijk}A_iB_jC_k$: $$\\begin{align} \\epsilon_{ijk}A_iB_jC_k & = \\color{#C33602}{\\epsilon_{ijk}A_i(B_jC_k)} \\qquad \\text{ or } \\color{#766303}{\\qquad \\epsilon_{ijk}(A_iB_j)C_k}    \n\\\\                             \n& = \\color{#C33602}{\\mathbf A\\cdot(\\mathbf B\\times\\mathbf C)} \\qquad \\text{ or } \\color{#766303}{\\qquad (\\mathbf A\\times\\mathbf B) \\cdot \\mathbf C = \\mathbf C \\cdot (\\mathbf A\\times\\mathbf B) }  \\end{align}$$\nThese two expressions are actually equal, due to the vector identity:\n$$\\color{#C33602}{\\mathbf A\\cdot(\\mathbf B\\times\\mathbf C)}=\\mathbf B\\cdot(\\mathbf C\\times\\mathbf A) = \\color{#766303}{\\mathbf C\\cdot(\\mathbf A\\times\\mathbf B)}$$ So on both sides you can do odd permutations which require a sign change while even permutations which do NOT. On the LHS in terms of the components, a sign change equates with an odd permutation of the indices. On the RHS in terms of the vector expression, a sign change equates with an exchange of the two factors of the cross product (preceded and/or followed by one of the equivalent changes mentioned above, of course). However, if ♦ the order of indices matches in the Levi-Civita symbol and the corresponding vector components ♦ and the order of the vector names matches in the component expression and the vector expression, then you are on the safe side without putting much thought into it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about proving the divergence of a cross product using Einstein summation notation. They have several sub-questions related to manipulating the Levi-Civita symbols and the resulting terms.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main problem and the assumptions. The main problem seems to be proving the identity for the divergence of a cross product, specifically dealing with the steps in Einstein notation. The user has multiple questions (1, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4) about index manipulation, the order of terms, and why certain sign changes occur. \n\nThe assumptions would include the properties of the Levi-Civita symbol, the use of Einstein summation, and the vector calculus identities involved. Each assumption should be a single condition on one object. For example, the Levi-Civita symbol's antisymmetry, the product rule for differentiation, and the definitions of divergence and curl in index notation.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the key is to list each assumption separately. So, for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{hij}$ is antisymmetric under permutation of indices.\n2. The product rule applies to the partial derivatives of the product $F_i G_j$.\n3. The divergence operator $\\nabla \\cdot$ is expressed as $\\partial_h$ in Einstein notation.\n4. The curl of a vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ is expressed as $\\epsilon_{hij} \\partial_h F_i$ in Einstein notation.\n5. The dot product of two vectors in Einstein notation involves contraction over one index.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{F} \\times \\mathbf{G}) = \\mathbf{G} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}) - \\mathbf{F} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{G})$ using Einstein summation notation, addressing the questions about index ordering, sign changes, and term rearrangement.\n\nWait, but in the user's problem, they have specific sub-questions. However, the task is to structure the original problem (from the user's post) into the given format. So perhaps the main problem is the one in the title: \"How can I prove $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{F} \\times \\mathbf{G})$ with Einstein Summation Notation?\" and the assumptions are the mathematical properties they are using, like the Levi-Civita symbol's properties, product rule, etc.\n\nBut the user's questions are more about specific steps in the proof, like why certain terms become dot products instead of cross products, and sign issues. However, the format requires listing assumptions and the problem. So the assumptions would be the mathematical tools they can use, and the problem is to prove the identity, considering those steps.\n\nOriginal problem components:\n- The user is following a proof from Stewart's Calculus.\n- They have an expression using Levi-Civita symbols.\n- They expand using product rule, leading to two terms.\n- They are confused about why one term becomes $\\mathbf{G} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F})$ instead of a cross product.\n- There's a sign error they noticed (the correct identity has a minus, but their expansion shows a plus).\n- They have questions about index ordering and swapping indices in the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\nSo the main problem is to prove the identity for the divergence of a cross product, and the assumptions include the properties of Levi-Civita, product rule, index notation for divergence and curl, etc.\n\nNow, structuring it as per the example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{hij}$ is antisymmetric under permutation of any two indices.\n- The divergence operator $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}$ is expressed in index notation as $\\partial_h A_h$.\n- The cross product $\\mathbf{F} \\times \\mathbf{G}$ is expressed in index notation as $\\epsilon_{hij} F_i G_j$.\n- The product rule applies to the differentiation of a product of functions.\n- The curl of a vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ in index notation is $\\epsilon_{hij} \\partial_h F_i$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{F} \\times \\mathbf{G}) = \\mathbf{G} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}) - \\mathbf{F} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{G})$ using Einstein summation notation, addressing the manipulation of Levi-Civita symbols, sign changes from index permutations, and the correct identification of dot and cross products.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the example was concise. The original problem's main goal is to prove the identity, but the user's specific questions are about the steps. However, the task is to present the problem in the given format, which requires listing assumptions and the problem statement. The user's detailed questions are part of the original problem but in the format, we need to extract the main problem and the necessary assumptions.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{hij}$ is antisymmetric under permutation of indices.\n- The product rule applies to the partial derivatives of the product $F_i G_j$.\n- The divergence of a vector field is given by $\\partial_h (\\mathbf{F} \\times \\mathbf{G})_h$.\n- The cross product $\\mathbf{F} \\times \\mathbf{G}$ is expressed as $\\epsilon_{hij} F_i G_j$ in index notation.\n- The curl of a vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ is given by $\\epsilon_{hij} \\partial_h F_i$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{F} \\times \\mathbf{G}) = \\mathbf{G} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}) - \\mathbf{F} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{G})$ using Einstein summation notation, explaining the handling of terms involving the Levi-Civita symbol, the sign change due to index permutation, and the identification of dot products over cross products.\n\nBut the user's specific questions are numbered 1, 3, etc., but in the format, we need to present the problem as a single statement, and the assumptions as bullet points. The user's questions are more about the process, but the formatted problem should be the main task, with assumptions as the underlying mathematical rules needed.\n\nI think the key is to extract the main problem the user is trying to solve, which is the divergence of the cross product identity, and the assumptions are the mathematical tools (Levi-Civita properties, product rule, index notation definitions). The user's specific questions about index ordering and sign changes are part of the problem they need to resolve in their proof.",
