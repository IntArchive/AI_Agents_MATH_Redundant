    "Content": "Using Lagrange multipliers, it can be shown that a triangle with given perimeter has the maximum possible area, if it is equilateral. Is there a simple geometric proof of that fact ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As Carl pointed out, Heron's formula gives the area of a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$ as $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)$. Let $2s=a+b+c>0$, and suppose $A^2=s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)$ is maximized for $a$, $b$, and $c$ that are not all equal. Without loss of generality, assume $a<b$. It's straightforward to show that $s(s−\\displaystyle\\frac{a+b}{2})(s−\\frac{a+b}{2})(s−c)>A^2$, which means that you'll get a triangle of larger area if you replace the unequal sides $a$ and $b$ with equal sides, keeping the same perimeter. This contradicts the assumption that $a\\neq b$ at the maximum.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to convert the original question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that an equilateral triangle has the maximum area for a given perimeter using a simple geometric proof instead of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided lists each assumption line by line, focusing on one property per line. The problem here mentions a triangle with a given perimeter. The key points are:\n\n1. The triangle has a given perimeter. This is a condition applied to the triangle.\n2. The goal is to prove maximum area. The problem is about maximizing the area under the perimeter constraint.\n3. The method requested is a simple geometric proof, not using Lagrange multipliers. However, assumptions should relate to the problem's conditions, not the method of proof. So the method might not be an assumption here.\n\nWait, the original problem states that using Lagrange multipliers shows the result, but asks for a geometric proof. The assumptions in the problem should be the conditions of the problem, not the method. So the main assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle has a given perimeter.\n- The problem is about comparing areas of triangles with this perimeter.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be about the triangle's properties. Wait, but the problem is general: any triangle with given perimeter. So the assumptions might not need to list specific properties beyond the given perimeter. However, maybe there are implicit assumptions, like the triangle is non-degenerate, but the original question might not specify that. The original problem just states \"a triangle with given perimeter\". \n\nIn the example, the assumption included that n is an integer, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the assumption here is that the triangle is a triangle (so three sides), has a given perimeter, and maybe that it's a closed figure? But those might be too obvious. Alternatively, maybe there's an assumption about the triangle being equilateral in the conclusion, but no, the problem is to prove that the equilateral triangle is the one with maximum area. So the assumptions would be the conditions given, which are that the perimeter is fixed, and the triangle is a triangle. But perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the problem's setup. Wait, the example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, the assumption is that we're dealing with triangles, with a given perimeter. However, the problem as stated in the original question is: \"a triangle with given perimeter has the maximum possible area if it is equilateral\". So the problem is to prove that among all triangles with a fixed perimeter, the equilateral one has the maximum area. Therefore, the assumption is that the perimeter is fixed. But maybe I need to list that as an assumption. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like maybe the user made a mistake? Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. But maybe the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the example given by the user has a mistake. But regardless, following the user's example, the assumptions are listed as specific conditions. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumption is that the triangle has a given perimeter, and perhaps the triangle is a closed figure with three sides. But maybe the problem doesn't need more than one assumption. Wait, the example had two assumptions, but in this case, maybe only one. Let me see. The problem is to prove that among triangles with a given perimeter, the equilateral one has maximum area. So the key assumption is that the perimeter is fixed. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The triangle has a given perimeter.\n\nProblem: Prove that the triangle with maximum area is equilateral.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions, even though the original problem might not require them. But perhaps in this case, there's only one assumption. Alternatively, maybe also that the triangle is non-degenerate, but that's probably assumed. The user might want each assumption to be one line, so if there are multiple, list them. However, the original problem doesn't mention any other conditions. So maybe the only assumption is that the triangle has a given perimeter. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The triangle has a given perimeter.\n\nProblem: Prove that the triangle with maximum area is equilateral.\n\nBut wait, the original problem title is \"Simple proof that equilateral triangles have maximum area\". The question is asking for a simple geometric proof of the fact that a triangle with given perimeter has maximum area if equilateral. So the problem is to prove that the maximum area is achieved by the equilateral triangle when the perimeter is fixed. So the assumption is the perimeter is fixed, and the problem is to prove the equilateral triangle is the one with maximum area.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The triangle has a given perimeter.\n\nProblem: Prove that the triangle has the maximum possible area if it is equilateral.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was two lines. Maybe here, the only assumption is the given perimeter. So that's one line. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: The triangle has a given perimeter.\nProblem: Prove that the triangle has the maximum possible area if it is equilateral.\n###",
