    "AcceptedAnswer": "We have to assume that we are considering complex matrices. Over the reals the assertion is not true, as the example\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0\\\\0&0&1\\\\0&-1&0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nshows. Over $\\mathbb C$, one can do the Schur decomposition , where $A=VTV^*$, with $V$ unitary and $T$ upper triangular. Since the diagonal of $T$ has to contain the eigenvalues of $A$, it has be zero. And it is an easy exercise that if $T$ is an $n\\times n$ upper triangular with diagonal zero, then $T^n=0$. So $A^n=(VTV^*)^n=VT^nV^*=0$, and $A$ is nilpotent.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave shows breaking down the assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nThe original question here is: \"Prove that a matrix with only zero eigenvalues must be nilpotent.\" So first, I need to list the assumptions. The key points here are that the matrix has only zero as an eigenvalue. Also, the matrix in question is probably a square matrix because eigenvalues are defined for square matrices. \n\nWait, the problem says \"a matrix,\" but eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices. So the first assumption should be that the matrix is square. Then, the second assumption is that all its eigenvalues are zero. \n\nThe problem statement is to prove that such a matrix is nilpotent. Nilpotent means that some power of the matrix is the zero matrix. So the problem is to show that if a square matrix has all eigenvalues zero, then it's nilpotent.\n\nLet me check if there are any other assumptions. The problem doesn't specify the field, but usually, this is over an algebraically closed field. Wait, but the question might be general. However, eigenvalues being zero might require the field to be algebraically closed to ensure all roots are present. Hmm, but the original problem doesn't mention that. Maybe it's assumed to be over the complex numbers? Or maybe the user expects the answer to not specify the field. Since the original problem doesn't mention the field, maybe we shouldn't assume it. But eigenvalues are defined in terms of the characteristic polynomial, which splits into linear factors over an algebraically closed field. So perhaps the assumption is that the matrix is over an algebraically closed field? Or maybe the problem is true for any field, but I know that over an algebraically closed field, the statement holds. For example, the Jordan form would be strictly upper triangular with zeros on the diagonal, hence nilpotent. But over a field where the characteristic polynomial doesn't split, maybe the matrix isn't nilpotent? Hmm, but the problem statement as given on Math Stack Exchange is probably assuming the field is algebraically closed, like the complex numbers. However, since the user didn't specify, maybe I shouldn't add that as an assumption unless necessary. Wait, the original question says \"a matrix with only zero as an eigenvalue\". If the field isn't algebraically closed, the eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial in that field. So if all eigenvalues (in the field) are zero, then even if the characteristic polynomial doesn't split, but the only eigenvalues in the field are zero. But in that case, does the matrix have to be nilpotent? I think that nilpotent matrices over any field have only zero eigenvalues, but the converse might require the characteristic polynomial to split. For example, consider a matrix over the real numbers with minimal polynomial x^2 + 1. It has no real eigenvalues, but that's not the case here. Here, the matrix has all eigenvalues (in the field) equal to zero. If the field is such that the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors, then yes, the matrix is similar to a strictly upper triangular matrix, hence nilpotent. But if the field isn't algebraically closed, even if all eigenvalues in the field are zero, the characteristic polynomial might not split, so the matrix might not be nilpotent. Therefore, perhaps the problem is assuming the field is algebraically closed? But the original problem didn't specify. Hmm. This is a bit of a nuance. However, in the context of a typical linear algebra course, especially when discussing eigenvalues and nilpotent matrices, it's common to work over an algebraically closed field like the complex numbers. So maybe that's an implicit assumption here. Alternatively, the problem might be considering the algebraic closure. But since the user example didn't include such assumptions unless explicitly stated, maybe we shouldn't add it here. Wait, the original problem is \"Prove that a matrix with only zero eigenvalues must be nilpotent.\" To have eigenvalues, the matrix must be square. So the key assumptions are: the matrix is square, and all its eigenvalues (in the field) are zero. But to ensure that the matrix is nilpotent, we might need that the characteristic polynomial splits into x^n, which would require the field to be algebraically closed. However, in the problem statement, maybe they are working over C. But since it's not specified, perhaps the problem is intended to be over such a field. But the user's example didn't add any assumptions about the field unless it was part of the original problem. So here, the original problem just says \"a matrix with only zero eigenvalues\". Therefore, the assumptions should be: 1. A is a square matrix. 2. All eigenvalues of A are zero. The problem is to prove that A is nilpotent. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be: - A is a square matrix. - All eigenvalues of A are 0. Problem: Prove that A is nilpotent. Alternatively, maybe the problem is more general, but I think the key is to stick to what's given. The original question doesn't mention the field, so we shouldn't assume it. However, in linear algebra, when eigenvalues are discussed without specifying the field, it's often assumed to be over an algebraically closed field like C. But since the user's example didn't include such implicit assumptions unless stated, maybe we just list the given ones. So the assumptions are: A is a square matrix, All eigenvalues of A are 0. Then the problem is to prove A is nilpotent. Yes, that seems right. So the formatted problem would have those two assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was about proving A(n) divisible by 91, and the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem changed it to n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem is for every integer n, so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error. But maybe in their actual example, they wanted to restructure a problem where the original had hidden assumptions. Maybe the example was a wrong example. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is \"Prove that a matrix with only zero eigenvalues must be nilpotent.\" So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The matrix is square (since eigenvalues are defined for square matrices).\n2. All eigenvalues of the matrix are zero.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the matrix is nilpotent.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these two assumptions and then the problem statement.",
