    "Content": "Suppose that $f$ is a real-valued function on $\\Bbb R$ whose derivative exists at each point and is bounded. Prove that $f$ is uniformly continuous.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $f'$ is bounded then there's $M>0$ s.t.\n$$|f'(x)|\\leq M\\quad \\forall x\\in\\mathbb{R}$$\nhence by mean value theorem we find\n$$|f(x)-f(y)|\\leq M|x-y|\\quad \\forall x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}$$\nso $f$ is a lipschitzian function on $\\mathbb{R}$ and therefore it's s uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave includes breaking down the problem's assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nThe original problem here is about proving that a function with a bounded derivative is uniformly continuous. Let me parse through the question. The function f is real-valued, defined on all of R, and its derivative exists at each point with the derivative being bounded. The goal is to prove uniform continuity.\n\nSo, the assumptions need to be listed one by one. First, the function is real-valued. Second, it's defined on the entire real line. Third, the derivative exists everywhere. Fourth, the derivative is bounded. Each of these is a separate assumption applying to the function f. The problem statement then is to prove uniform continuity.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's prompt had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this problem, the assumptions are all about the function f. Let me make sure I don't miss any. The problem states \"Suppose that f is a real-valued function on R whose derivative exists at each point and is bounded.\" So breaking that down:\n\n1. f is a real-valued function.\n2. f is defined on the entire set of real numbers R.\n3. f is differentiable at every point in R.\n4. The derivative f' is bounded on R.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. The problem is to prove that f is uniformly continuous on R.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, sometimes differentiability might be assumed to be continuous, but here since the derivative exists everywhere, f is already differentiable, hence continuous. But the key assumptions here are the four I listed. So that should be correct. Let me structure it accordingly.",
