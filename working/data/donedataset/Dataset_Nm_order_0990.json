    "Content": "Suppose $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is such that $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ are odd. How do I show that $f(x)$ has no integer roots?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Another proof can be done using the fact that if $f$ has integer coefficients and $a\\neq b$ are integers, then $a-b \\mid f(a)-f(b)$ . Because $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ are odd, it follows that $f(k)$ is odd for every integer $k$ , and therefore no integer can be a root.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to understand the original problem and extract the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\) with certain conditions (f(0) and f(1) are odd) has no integer roots. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that \\( f(x) \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\), which means all its coefficients are integers. Then, two specific conditions are given: \\( f(0) \\) is odd and \\( f(1) \\) is odd. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n1. \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial with integer coefficients (since \\( f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\)).\n2. \\( f(0) \\) is odd.\n3. \\( f(1) \\) is odd.\n\nThe problem statement is to show that \\( f(x) \\) has no integer roots. \n\nI need to make sure there's no extra information. The title and question don't mention anything else, so these should be the only assumptions. Let me check the example given again. The example included the assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, each on separate lines. Similarly here, each condition (integer coefficients, f(0) odd, f(1) odd) are separate. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should look like:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( f(x) \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\),\n\\( f(0) \\) is odd,\n\\( f(1) \\) is odd.\nProblem:\nProve that \\( f(x) \\) has no integer roots.\n\nWait, in the example, they rephrased the problem statement a bit. Let me check the original problem again. The original problem says \"has no integer roots,\" so that's the problem statement. The assumptions are correctly listed. There's no need to include anything else. The example didn't include the title, just the problem. So this should be correct.",
