    "Content": "Dr. Pinter's \"A Book of Abstract Algebra\" presents this exercise: Prove/disprove whether the following function $f$ (with inputs/outputs of real numbers) is injective and/or surjective:\n  $$f(x)=x^{3}+1.$$ Using this helpful answer , I solved for $$f(a)=f(b)\\colon$$ $$f(a)=a^{3}+1$$ \n$$f(b)=b^{3}+1$$\n$$a^{3}+1=b^{3}+1$$\n$$a^{3}=b^{3} \\text{ subtract 1 from each side}$$\n$$(a^{3})^{1/3}=(b^{3})^{1/3} \\text{ take the cubic root of each side}$$\n$$a=b$$ Therefore, $f$ is injective. Again, following that helpful answer, solve for $x$, and then plug into $f(x)$: $$y=x^{3}+1$$\n$$y-1=x^{3}$$\n$$x=(y-1)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$$ Now, plug $x$ into $f$, and check if result equals $y$, which would prove the surjective property. $$f(x)=x^{3}+1$$\n$$y=((y-1)^{1/3})^{3}+1 \\text{ use $y$ rather than $f(x)$}$$\n$$y=y-1+1$$\n$$y=y$$ Therefore, it's also surjective. Is this right?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As in the answer you linked to (my answer), I would try to structure your proofs more clearly: Claim: The mapping $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=x^3+1$ is injective. Proof . Let $x_1,x_2\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and suppose $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$. Then\n$$\nf(x_1)=f(x_2)\\\\[0.5em]\nx_1^3+1=x_2^3+1\\\\[0.5em]\nx_1^3=x_2^3\\\\[0.5em]\nx_1=x_2.\n$$\nThus, the mapping is injective. $\\blacksquare$ Claim: The mapping $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=x^3+1$ is surjective. Proof . Suppose $y\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Then let $x=\\sqrt[3]{y-1}$. We have the following:\n\\begin{align}\nf(x) &= x^3+1\\\\[0.5em]\n&= (\\sqrt[3]{y-1})^3+1\\\\[0.5em]\n&= (y-1)+1\\\\[0.5em]\n&= y.\n\\end{align}\nThus, the mapping is surjective. $\\blacksquare$ Note: As you have seen, writing up proofs in math is not only about squeezing out an accurate proof. You want to write it clearly, concisely, etc. The goal is to be concise but not at the cost of clarity. Oftentimes this is a fine line to walk.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a math professor and format their problem according to the given structure. Let me start by understanding the original question from Math Stack Exchange.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether the function f(x) = x³ + 1 is injective and/or surjective. The user went through their own proof, showing that it's both injective and surjective. They're asking if their reasoning is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement as per the required format. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem, the function is defined as f(x) = x³ + 1. The domain and codomain aren't explicitly stated, but since the user mentions real numbers, I should note that. So the assumptions would include that f is a function from real numbers to real numbers. Also, the operations involved are cube and addition, which are valid over real numbers. Each assumption should be a single line. \n\nThe problem is to prove or disprove if f is injective and/or surjective. The user's approach checks injectivity by assuming f(a) = f(b) and showing a = b, which is correct for injectivity. For surjectivity, they solve y = x³ + 1 for x in terms of y and verify that substituting back gives y = y, which is valid. Since cube roots exist for all real numbers, this works over the reals. \n\nSo the assumptions are:\n- The domain of f is real numbers.\n- The codomain of f is real numbers.\n- f is defined by f(x) = x³ + 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove or disprove if f is injective and/or surjective.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included the divisibility condition. Here, the assumptions are about the function's definition. The key here is that each assumption is a single property. So the function's domain and codomain are separate assumptions. Also, the definition of f as x³ +1 is another.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from real numbers to real numbers,\nf is defined by f(x) = x³ + 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove whether f is injective and/or surjective.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user didn't specify the domain and codomain explicitly. However, in math, when not specified, it's often assumed to be real numbers unless stated otherwise. But since the user mentions \"inputs/outputs of real numbers\" in the question, that should be included as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those assumptions. Each assumption on a separate line. Then the problem statement is to prove or disprove injectivity and surjectivity.\n\nI think that's it. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Similarly here, the assumptions are about the function's domain, codomain, and definition. Then the problem is about injectivity/surjectivity.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be structured accordingly.",
