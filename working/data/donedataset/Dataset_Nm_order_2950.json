    "Content": "Suppose $K$ is a $p$-adic field (finite extension of the $p$-adics), and let $n$ be any integer (independent of what $p$ is). Define $U$ to be the set of all $x$ in $K$ such that $|x| = 1$ and such that $x = y^n$ for some $y$ in $K$. I would like to show that $U$ is an open set and that as a multiplicative group $U$ has finite index in the group of elements of $K$ of norm $1$. What's the best way of seeing why this is true (assuming it is)? I pretty much have an idea why this holds.. in the $p$-adic case you can prove the $n$th powers are of bounded index in ${\\bf Z}_{p^l}$ for each $l$ and then use an inverse limiting-type argument as $l$ goes to infinity to get this for $K = {\\mathbb Q_p}$, and I think an analogous argument using powers of a uniformizer in place of powers of $p$ should work for a general $K$. But I keep thinking that this should be some well-known result or something that follows quickly from a well-known result. So I thought I'd throw this out.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are lots of ways to see this.  My preferred method is as follows: What you want to show is that if $x \\equiv 1 \\bmod \\pi^N$ for sufficiently large\n$N$ then $x$ is an $n$th power; here $\\pi$ is uniformizer.  (This shows that $U$ contains all $x$ that are $\\equiv 1 \\bmod \\pi^N$, and hence is open, as desired.) Well, just use the classical binomial formula: writing $x = 1 + \\pi^N y,$\nwe have \n$$x^{1/n} = (1 + \\pi^N y)^{1/n} = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}(\\frac{1}{n}\n- 1) \\cdots (\\frac{1}{n} - i + 1) \\frac{\\pi^{N i} y^i}{i !}.$$\nThe denominator of the $i$th term is (bounded above by) $n^i i!$, so provided\nthat $N$ is large enough, the ratio $\\dfrac{\\pi^{N i}}{n^i i!}$ will tend to\nzero $\\pi$-adically, and thus so will our series.  It's then easy to argue\nthat this series in fact converges to an $n$th root of $x$, as required. A good example to think about is the case $n = 2$ and $K = \\mathbb Q_p$,\nfirst when $p$ is odd, and then when $p = 2$.  In the former case you should\nfind that any $x \\equiv 1 \\bmod p$ is a square, while in the latter case, you will\nfind that the condition $x \\equiv 1 \\bmod 8$ is required.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question. The user is asking about nth powers in a p-adic field K. They want to show two things: that the set U of elements of norm 1 which are nth powers is open, and that U has finite index in the group of all elements of norm 1. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that K is a p-adic field, which means it's a finite extension of the p-adic numbers Q_p. Then n is an integer independent of p. U is defined as the set of x in K with |x| = 1 and x = y^n for some y in K. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- K is a p-adic field (finite extension of Q_p).\n- n is an integer, independent of p.\n- U is the set of x in K where |x| = 1 and x is an nth power in K.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"any integer (independent of what p is)\", so that's another assumption: n is independent of p. Then U is defined with those two conditions: norm 1 and being an nth power. The problem is to show U is open and has finite index in the group of elements of norm 1. \n\nSo the user wants these two conclusions. Now, the example given earlier had the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. So I need to list each assumption separately.\n\nAssumptions:\n- K is a p-adic field (finite extension of the p-adics Q_p),\n- n is an integer,\n- n is independent of the prime p,\n- U is the set of all x in K such that |x| = 1,\n- For each x in U, there exists y in K such that x = y^n.\n\nWait, maybe split the definition of U into two conditions: |x|=1 and x is an nth power. So each of those is a separate assumption about U. But since U is defined by those two, perhaps each condition is a separate point. \n\nBut the problem statement is \"Define U to be the set...\", so maybe U's definition is two parts: norm 1 and being an nth power. So the assumptions would include those two conditions as part of U's definition. \n\nProblem is to show U is open and has finite index in the group of elements of norm 1. So the problem part would be: Show that U is an open set and that U has finite index in the group of elements of K with norm 1.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are listed as separate properties. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a p-adic field (finite extension of Q_p),\nn is an integer,\nn is independent of p,\nU is the set of x in K with |x| = 1,\nEach element x in U satisfies x = y^n for some y in K.\n\nWait, but the problem defines U as those x with |x|=1 and x = y^n. So the last two points are the definition of U. So each part of the definition is a separate assumption. So the assumptions would list the properties of K, n, and the definition of U in parts.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions:\n\n- K is a p-adic field (finite extension of the p-adic numbers Q_p),\n- n is an integer,\n- The integer n is independent of the prime p,\n- U is the set of elements x in K with |x| = 1,\n- For each x in U, there exists y in K such that x = y^n.\n\nThen the problem is to show that U is open and has finite index in the group of elements of K with norm 1.\n\nI think that covers all the necessary assumptions. The user also mentions their own approach, but that's part of their thought process, not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem is to show U is open and has finite index. So the formatted problem should list those assumptions and state the problem accordingly.",
