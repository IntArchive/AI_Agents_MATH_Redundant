    "Content": "In Edsger Dijkstra's monograph \"Notes on Structured Programming\", he describes a simple imperative program for generating an array of the first $n$ primes. For each prime $p_n$, it finds the next prime by checking each odd $j \\gt p_n$, to see if it has a prime divisor $d$ in the range $2 \\lt d \\le \\sqrt j$. The algorithm draws these candidates from the array of prime numbers it has been constructing, which at any given iteration contains the primes between $2$ and $p_n$ inclusive, so there is an implicit assumption is that $\\sqrt j \\le p_n$ (the algorithm iterates over the array of primes up to $p_n$ with the only termination conditions being $d|j$ or $d > \\sqrt j$, so if $\\sqrt j$ could be $\\ge p_n$ we risk reading past the end of the array). Quoting Dijkstra: In all humility I quote Don Knuth's comment on an earlier version of this program, where I took this fact for granted: \"Here you are guilty of a serious omission! Your program makes use of a deep result of number theory, namely that if $p_n$ denotes the $n$th prime number we always have $p_{n+1} < p_n^2$.\" So I'm curious about the history of this \"deep result\", and how difficult the proof is.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I am uncertain of that particular proof, but I know a few proofs of Bertrand's Postulate . Bertrand's says that for all $n > 3$, there is a prime between $n$ and $2n$. In particular, this means that given a prime $p_0$, there is another prime $p_1$ s.t. $p_0 < p_1 < 2p_0$ As $2 < p_0$, we then have that there is a $p_1$ s.t. $$p_0 < p_1 < 2p_0 < p_0 ^2$$ I think the Wikipedia proof is not so bad. Bertrand actually proved his conjecture himself in the late 1800's, and there are many proofs. Ramanujan made one, Erdos improved up it. There are also many better results and asymptotic results - I have used Pierre Dusart's improvement before, which says that for sufficiently large x (larger than 3275), there is a prime between $x$ and $x + \\dfrac{x}{1 + 2\\log^2 x}$. That's very intense! But that idea is somewhat deep, and it relates to the Prime Number Theorem on the distribution of primes (which I would call very deep).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully. The user is asking about the history and proof difficulty of the result that p_{n+1} < p_n^2. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem mentions that Dijkstra's algorithm assumes sqrt(j) <= p_n when checking for primes. The key condition here is that p_{n+1} must be less than p_n squared. So the assumptions should be about the primes involved.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. The original problem in the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about prime numbers. The main assumption seems to be that p_n is the nth prime. But wait, the result p_{n+1} < p_n^2 is a general statement about primes, so perhaps the assumption is that p_n denotes the nth prime number. That's a single assumption. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem's assumption included the divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem included that as an assumption. Here, the result p_{n+1} < p_n^2 is a theorem, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which this theorem holds. Since the theorem is about all primes, the main assumption is that p_n is the nth prime. However, maybe there's more. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe algorithm uses the fact that sqrt(j) <= p_n, which leads to needing p_{n+1} < p_n^2. The problem is to prove this inequality. So the assumption is that p_n is the nth prime number, and perhaps that n is a positive integer. But the example had two assumptions when the original problem mentioned n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about primes in general. So perhaps the only assumption is that p_n is the nth prime. But maybe n is a positive integer. So two assumptions: p_n is the nth prime number, and n is a positive integer. But wait, in the example, the original problem had n as an integer, which was an assumption. So here, perhaps n being a positive integer is an assumption. \n\nLet me structure the assumptions. The problem is to prove that p_{n+1} < p_n^2 for all n. The key assumptions are:\n\n1. p_n denotes the nth prime number.\n2. n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the original question mentions that the algorithm assumes sqrt(j) <= p_n, leading to the need for p_{n+1} < p_n^2. So the theorem's validity is under the condition that n is a positive integer, and p_n is the nth prime. Therefore, the assumptions should list these. Each on a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\np_n is the nth prime number,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that p_{n+1} < p_n^2.\n\nWait, but the original problem in the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem's question was about \"for every integer n\". However, in the example, the user structured the problem with an assumption that n is divisible by 7, perhaps because the original problem had that condition. Wait, no. Wait the example's original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. But perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user wants to follow that format. However, in the example, the original problem's assumption that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe that was a mistake, but the user provided it as an example. So perhaps in this case, the user wants us to structure the problem with assumptions even if they are part of the theorem's statement. Wait, but in the current problem, the theorem is that p_{n+1} < p_n^2, and the assumptions are that p_n is the nth prime and n is a positive integer. But the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem's theorem (divisible by 7), which might have been part of the problem's hidden conditions. Wait, perhaps the example was a misrepresentation. But since the user provided that example, we have to follow the format even if the assumptions are part of the theorem's hypotheses.\n\nIn the current case, the theorem is \"for all n, p_{n+1} < p_n^2\", so the assumptions are that p_n is the nth prime and n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\np_n is the nth prime number,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that p_{n+1} < p_n².\n\nBut I need to check if there are more assumptions. The algorithm's context mentions that sqrt(j) <= p_n, which requires j <= p_n². Since j is the next prime candidate after p_n, which is p_{n+1}, so j = p_{n+1}, and thus they need p_{n+1} < p_n². Therefore, the key assumption is that p_n is the nth prime, and n is such that the next prime exists. But since primes are infinite, perhaps n being a positive integer is sufficient. So the two assumptions as before.",
