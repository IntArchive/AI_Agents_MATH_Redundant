    "Content": "What is the proof that the number of permutations of similar objects is counted by the multinomial coefficient? I know the formula, but I cannot figure out how to derive it! permutations of similar objects The number of permutations of $n=n_1+n_2+\\dots+n_r$ objects of which $n_1$ are of one type, $n_2$ are of a second type, $\\dots$ , and $n_r$ are of an $r$ th type is $$\\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_r!}$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Another way of looking at this is: You have $n = n_1 + n_2 + \\dots + n_r$ slots and need to fill them all. You can fill in the $n_1$ items of type $1$ in $\\binom{n}{n_1}$ ways. The remaining $n-n_1$ slots can be filled with $n_2$ items in $\\binom{n-n_1}{n_2}$ ways. Continuing this way, the required number of ways is $$ \\binom{n}{n_1} \\cdot \\binom{n-n_1}{n_2} \\cdots \\binom{n-n_1-n_2-\\dots-n_{r-2}}{n_{r-1}} \\cdot 1 =$$ $$ \\frac{n!}{n_1! (n-n_1)!} \\cdot \\frac{ (n-n_1)!}{(n-n_1-n_2)! n_2!} \\cdots \\frac{(n-n_1-n_2 - \\dots -n_{r-2})!}{n_r! n_{r-1}!} = $$ $$ \\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \\dots n_r!}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read the original question carefully. The user is asking for the proof that the number of permutations of similar objects is counted by the multinomial coefficient. They mention the formula n! divided by the product of n1! n2! ... nr!, and they want to know how to derive it.\n\nThe example provided in the problem shows that assumptions should list each condition on one line, applied to one object. Looking at the original problem, the key elements here are the objects and their types. The problem deals with permutations of multiset objects where there are duplicates.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would involve the total number of objects being the sum of each type. Let me break it down:\n\n1. There are a total of n objects.\n2. The objects are divided into r distinct types.\n3. Each type i has exactly ni identical objects (for i from 1 to r).\n4. The total number of objects is n = n1 + n2 + ... + nr.\n\nThese assumptions set up the scenario where we have multiple objects of the same type, and we need to count the distinct permutations. The problem then is to prove that the number of such permutations is given by the multinomial coefficient formula.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, they had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem doesn't have any divisibility conditions. The assumptions are about the structure of the objects: how many types there are, how many of each type, and that they're indistinct within their types. So I need to list those as separate assumptions.\n\nEach assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n- First, the total number of objects is n. That's one assumption.\n- Then, the objects are partitioned into r types. That's another assumption.\n- Each type i has ni objects. Since this is for each i from 1 to r, but maybe it's better to state that for each type, the count is specified as ni, and all objects of the same type are identical.\n- The sum of all ni equals n. That could be another assumption, but maybe in the original problem statement, it's already given as n = n1 + n2 + ... + nr. So perhaps that's an assumption.\n\nWait, the original problem states: \"the number of permutations of n = n1 + n2 + ... + nr objects of which n1 are of one type, ..., nr are of an rth type\". So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. There are n total objects.\n2. The n objects consist of r different types.\n3. For each type i (where i ranges from 1 to r), there are ni identical objects.\n4. The sum of all ni equals n (i.e., n1 + n2 + ... + nr = n).\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. However, the example in the user's prompt had each assumption on a separate line. For instance, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", and the second was \"n is divisible by 7\". Each is a separate condition on n.\n\nIn this case, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- There are n total objects,\n- The objects are partitioned into r distinct types,\n- For each type i (1 ≤ i ≤ r), there are ni identical objects,\n- The sum n1 + n2 + ... + nr equals n.\n\nBut the original problem statement includes all of these in the problem's premise. So each of these would be individual assumptions. Let me check if each line addresses only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- \"n is an integer\" is a single condition on n.\n- \"n is divisible by 7\" is another condition on n.\n\nSimilarly, here:\n\n- \"The total number of objects is n.\" – this is a single condition on the objects.\n- \"The objects are partitioned into r distinct types.\" – a condition on the classification of objects.\n- \"For each type i (1 ≤ i ≤ r), there are ni identical objects.\" – this is a condition applied to each type.\n- \"The sum of ni over all types i equals n.\" – another condition on the counts.\n\nSo each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have these four assumptions, then the problem statement as given.",
