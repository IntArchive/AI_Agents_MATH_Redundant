    "Content": "My homework assignment for next week has the following problem in it. Show that there exists a non-solvable group of order 180. The problem is easy to solve given that we have already proven that $A_5$ is not solvable. Since the product of two groups is solvable iff both groups are solvable, $A_5\\times\\mathbb Z/3\\mathbb Z$ isn't solvable, and it's clear that its order is 180. However, I thought it would be cool to see if there are others. I found a page on the internet which says that that aren't, but without proof. I know little group theory and I'm not used to working in groups -- last time I spent a significant amount of time on groups was during my first year. This makes me completely unable to think of a way to prove this statement, or even estimate its difficulty. Could you help me with this? I don't want to specify what kind of answer I want (a proof or a hint), because I don't know what is best for me. I would like to ask you to judge what kind of answer would be best in this case.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $G$ be a non-solvable group of order $180$. Let's count the Sylow 5-subgroups of $G$.  There can be $1$, $6$, or $36$. If there's $1$, it's normal (call it $P$), and $G/P$ is a (solvable!) group of order $36$, so $G$ is solvable; contradiction. If there's $36$, then a Sylow 5-subgroup $P$ is self normalizing, and being abelian, this implies $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $36$ (Burnside's transfer theorem); again, this implies $G$ is solvable. [Note that the argument here also implies if $N_G(P)$ is abelian, then $G$ is solvable.] So $G$ has $6$ Sylow 5-subgroups; if (again) one is called $P$, we have that $|N_G(P)|=\\frac{180}{6}=30$.  Since this is twice an odd number, and all groups of order $15$ are abelian, we see that $|N_G(P)/C_G(P)|\\le 2$. Thus if $x\\in N_G(P)$ has order $3$, we also have $x\\in C_G(P)$. The conjugation action of $G$ on the Sylow 5-subgroups maps $G$ to $S_6$, and since no element of order $3$ centralizes an element of order $5$ in $S_6$, we get that the subgroup of order $3$ in $N_G(P)$ is in the kernel of this mapping $G\\rightarrow S_6$. Since already then the image has size at most $\\frac{180}{3}=60$ (and $G$ is non-solvable!), this must be exactly the kernel. So $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $3$; call it $N$. [The above is just a long-winded argument to find a normal subgroup of order $3$.] Note that since $G$ in non-solvable, for any non-trivial normal subgroup $K\\lhd G$, either $|K|= 60$ or $[G:K]=60$. In particular, consider $C_G(N)$.  It contains a subgroup of order $9$ (in fact it contains all of them), as well as $N_G(P)$.  So it has order at least $90$, and we conclude $C_G(N)=G$, otherwise stated as: $N$ is central. Now suppose $G$ is perfect, i.e., $G'=G$. If we let $Q$ be a Sylow 3-subgroup (which of course contains $N$), we can form the transfer map $\\phi:\\ G\\rightarrow Q$.  Since $G$ is perfect, $\\phi(G)$ is trivial. But if $N=\\langle n\\rangle$, then $\\phi(n)=n^{[G:Q]}=n^{-1}$, because $n$ is central; contradiction. Thus $G' < G$.  We don't have $G'=N$, since $G/N$ is non-abelian.  Thus $G'$ has order $60$.  We can't have $N\\le G'$ (it implies $G$ is solvable), so we have $G'\\cap N=\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$. In particular, $G=N\\times G'$, with $G'\\cong G/N\\cong A_5$. We are done. [I should note things would go a lot quicker if we used some group cohomology, or even the Schur multiplier of $A_5$.]",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to know why there's exactly one non-solvable group of order 180. The original question mentions that constructing such a group via $A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ is straightforward, but proving uniqueness is another matter. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what makes a group non-solvable. A group is solvable if it has a normal series where all factor groups are abelian. For a group to be non-solvable, it must lack such a series. $A_5$ is known to be non-solvable because it's simple and non-abelian.\n\nNow, the order of the group in question is 180. Let's factorize that: 180 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5. The goal is to show there's only one non-solvable group of this order, which is $A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nTo approach uniqueness, we might need to use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible group structures. For a group of order 180, Sylow subgroups for primes 2, 3, and 5 need to be considered. \n\nStarting with Sylow 5-subgroups: The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 36 (since 180/5 = 36) and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible n_5 values are 1, 6, 36. If n_5=1, the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal, leading to solvability (since groups with normal Sylow subgroups can be broken down). If n_5=6 or 36, the group's structure is more complex. For a non-solvable group, n_5 can't be 1, so we need n_5=6 or 36. \n\nNext, consider the structure when n_5=6. The Sylow 5-subgroups intersect trivially, so the group acts on them by conjugation, leading to a homomorphism into S_6. The image must be transitive and have order divisible by 6*5=30. But the kernel of this homomorphism would be a normal subgroup, which in a non-solvable group should be minimal. If the image is A_5 (order 60), then the kernel would have order 3. However, A_5 doesn't have a normal subgroup of order 3. Alternatively, maybe the group is a semidirect product. \n\nAlternatively, if the group has a normal subgroup of order 3, then it could be a direct product. But if the group is non-solvable, the normal subgroup can't make the entire group solvable. So if we have $A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, the normal subgroup is the $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ part, and the quotient is $A_5$, which is non-solvable. \n\nTo show uniqueness, suppose there's another non-solvable group G of order 180. We need to show it must have a normal subgroup of order 3, hence splitting as a direct product. Alternatively, analyze the composition factors. Since G is non-solvable, it must have a composition factor that's non-abelian simple. The only candidates for order dividing 180 are A5 (order 60). So G must have A5 as a composition factor, and the other factor would be cyclic of order 3. Then by the Schreier conjecture, the outer automorphism group of A5 is S5, which is solvable, so any extension would split, leading to a direct product. Hence, G is A5 × Z/3Z. \n\nAlternatively, using the concept of Hall subgroups: A solvable group of order 180 would have Hall subgroups for every set of primes, but a non-solvable group lacks some. However, this might not directly help. \n\nAnother approach: The number of elements of order 5 in G must be 6*(5-1)=24 if n5=6. Then the remaining elements are 180 -24=156. The Sylow 3-subgroups have order 9, and Sylow 2-subgroups order 4. The interactions between these could force the structure into a direct product. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe using the classification of finite simple groups? Since 180 isn't a prime power, and the only simple group that could fit here is A5. Then the group G must be an extension of A5 by a cyclic group of order 3. Since Out(A5) is S5/A5 ≅ C2, which has order 2, so any extension would have to be a direct product, because H^2(A5, C3) would be trivial due to coprime action (since |A5|=60 and 3 is coprime, by Schur-Zassenhaus, the extension splits). Hence, only the direct product exists. \n\nTherefore, the only non-solvable group of order 180 is A5 × C3. Hence, the uniqueness.",
