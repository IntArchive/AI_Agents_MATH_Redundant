    "Content": "$\\newcommand{\\ms}{\\mathscr}$Please give me only a small hint, or give me an easier problem to solve that would help me do this. A sunflower is a family of sets (petals) for which ever pairwise intersection is the same. I want to prove Sunflower Lemma: Let $\\ms{A}$ be a family of sets such that $|A|\\le\\ell$ for each $A\\in\\ms{A}$. If $|\\ms{A}|>(p-1)^\\ell\\ell!$, then $\\ms{A}$ contains a sunflower with $p$ petals. (Thanks to Brian M Scott for the correct statement of the lemma) I though about this a lot but I didn't get much. First I realized that a family of sets like {1,2,3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3}, {1,2}, {1} is never a sunflower. I also found that if there is no sunflower with empty core (I named the pairwise intersection the core) then our sets are made out of at most $lp$ symbols. It's also impossible for our sunflower to have full core (equal to the whole set) because there would only be one set in our family of sets. I tried to think a bit about the probability of two sets having an intersection, but it didn't seem fruitful because it's so complex to try to generalize this to more sets. I was thinking for a while about the largest possible set containing no sunflower. If it didn't have any empty set in it's pairwise intersection then out of every $p$ sets at least one pair must have a nonempty intersection. I tried to use pigeonhole principle to get 3 petals but this gave a too weak bound. I am thinking about some way of doing the induction step for $\\ell$ like for sets of size $\\ell$ then $|\\ms{A}|>N=(p-1)^\\ell\\ell!$ has n $p$-sunflower $\\implies |\\ms{A}|>N \\cdot (p-1)(\\ell+1)$ for sets of size $\\ell+1$ has a $p$-sunflower. The is that if you allow the sets to be bigger, they're much more capable of avoiding being sunflowers. The reason for that might be related to my first observation. If I have $N \\cdot (p-1)(\\ell+1)$ then I was first thinking each of the $(p-1)(\\ell+1)$ blocks of size $N$ have a sunflower in them but I don't actually have that so I need a new idea. From Andres Caicedo hints I have the following: The proof should work by induction on $\\ell$, so suppose than any family of sets of size $\\ell$ will contain a $p$-petalled sunflower if $|\\ms{A}| > N$, we would like to find a bound on the cardinality of a family of sets of size $\\ell+1$ needed for it to contain a $p$-petalled sunflower. Suppose there are not $p$ pairwise disjoint sets, since if there were we would be done. Let $\\ms{F}$ be a maximal disjoint subfamily of $\\ms{A}$, then every set from $\\ms{A}$ has nonempty intersection with exactly one set of $\\ms{F}$ (otherwise it should have been included in $\\ms{F}$ since it's disjoint to everything in there). This allows us to partition $\\ms{A}$ into families $\\ms{A}_F$ for each $F \\in \\ms{F}$ and any sunflower must be completely contained in one of the families. Since there are at most $p-1$ of the $\\ms{A}_F$, we we would be able to get a bound for $\\ms{A}$ and be done by pigeonholing if we could just figure out how large an $\\ms{A}_F$ needs to be for there to be a $p$-petalled sunflower in it. This plan seems promising but I don't quite see how we could go from the idea of induction on $\\ell$ to the idea of taking a maximal disjoint subfamily. If any element was in more than $N$ of sets then we would have a sunflower by the induction hypothesis (just remove the element and we have a family of $N$ $\\ell$ sets). So I asked: How many sets would we need to meet $F$ in order for an element to be contained in $N$ of them? The answer is $N|F|$ which is at most $N (\\ell+1)$. The pigeonholing argument gives us that we need $N \\cdot (p-1)(\\ell+1)$ sets in $\\ms A$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "[The original formulation of the question had $|\\mathcal A|\\ge(p-1)^l l!$ rather than $|\\mathcal A|>(p-1)^l l!$. The result is true in this case, but a somewhat more delicate argument in needed, which made me suspect the intended question had the strict inequality, as in the current version. Some of the comments below refer to this original formulation.] Pretty sure there is a mistake in your statement, and what you want is to show that a family $\\mathcal A$ with more than $(p-1)^l l!$ many sets of size at most $l$ contains $p$ that form a sunflower. (Sunflowers are also called $\\Delta$-systems , by the way.) A reasonable approach is by induction on $l$. The result is clear if $l=1$, since then we have at least $p$ distinct singleton sets in $\\mathcal A$, which therefore are pairwise disjoint. We may assume that we do not have $p$ disjoint sets, and also that no element $x_0$ belongs to too many sets in $\\mathcal A$: If $x_0$ is in more than $(p-1)^{k-1}(k-1)!$ many sets, we can restrict to them, remove $x_0$ from each, and apply induction. The key idea is to combine these two observations. Pick a maximal pairwise disjoint subfamily $\\mathcal F$. Maximality buys us that any other set in $\\mathcal A$ meets one of the sets in this subfamily. This gives you a way of bounding $|\\mathcal A|$: There are at most $l-1$ sets in the disjoint subfamily, and any other set, must meet something in $\\mathcal F$. But we have a bound on the number of times we can have any element. I'll leave the details to you. Let me add that the original proof, in Paul Erdős, and Richard Rado. Intersection theorems for systems of sets , Journal of the London Mathematical Society, 2nd. series 35 (1) , (1960), 85–90. MR0111692 (22 #2554) starts the same way, and obtains a somewhat better bound, by an inclusion-exclusion argument: It is enough to assume \n $$ |\\mathcal A|> l!(p-1)^{l+1}\\left(1-\\frac1{2!(p-1)}-\\frac2{3!(p-1)^2}-\\dots-\\frac{l-1}{l!(p-1)^{l-1}}\\right). $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The key is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question, filtering out any unrelated information.\n\nFirst, looking at the original problem title: \"Sunflower combinatorics\". The user is referring to the Sunflower Lemma. The question starts with a request for a hint and mentions some attempts the user has made, but I need to focus on the actual problem statement.\n\nThe user mentions the Sunflower Lemma: Let 𝓐 be a family of sets where each set has size at most ℓ. If |𝓐| > (p-1)^ℓ * ℓ!, then 𝓐 contains a sunflower with p petals. \n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The lemma has specific conditions:\n\n1. Each set in the family 𝓐 has a size of at most ℓ. So, |A| ≤ ℓ for all A in 𝓐.\n2. The cardinality of the family 𝓐 is greater than (p-1)^ℓ multiplied by ℓ factorial.\n\nThese are the two main assumptions. The problem is to prove that under these conditions, 𝓐 contains a sunflower with p petals.\n\nThe user's original text includes their thought process, examples, and some incorrect attempts, but those are not part of the problem's assumptions. I should exclude those. Also, the mention of Brian M Scott correcting the lemma's statement isn't an assumption but just a credit. The core of the problem is the lemma itself with the two conditions.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Each set in 𝓐 has size at most ℓ.\n- The family 𝓐 has cardinality greater than (p−1)^ℓ × ℓ!.\n\nProblem: Prove that 𝓐 contains a sunflower with p petals.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, addressing one property applied to one object. The first assumption is about the size of each set in 𝓐, the second about the total number of sets in 𝓐. The problem is the conclusion to be proven.",
