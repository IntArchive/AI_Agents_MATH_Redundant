    "Content": "I was quite impressed by a beautiful proof 1 of the formula for n'th triangular number — it's kind of a bijective proof built on the top of geometric summation idea. Question : does this argument generalize to higher dimensions? i.e. can someone prove the formula for n-th «k-dimensional simplex number» this way? For example, the statement for k=3 is that n-th pyramidal number is $\\binom{n+2}{3}$. (One obvious fallback would be observing that any ball in the pyramid is characterized by its coordinates 2 , i.e. balls are counted by a negative binomial coefficient — which is exactly the desired result. That's a good proof, but needless to say, that's not the proof I'm looking for.) 1 original post by Mariano Suárez-Alvarez , cited by Vaughn Climenhaga 2 k-simplex is the subset $x_0+\\dots+x_k=1$, $x_i\\ge0$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$, and n-th k-simplex number is the number of non-negative integer solutions of $x_0+\\dots+x_k=n$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Place the balls so that the corners of the pyramid have coordinates (1,1,1), (n,1,1), (1,n,1), (1,1,n). Then for the ball at (x,y,z) we see that (x,x+y,x+y+z) is an ordered triple of distinct numbers between 1 and n+2 inclusive. There are $\\binom{n+2}{3}$ such triples, and they are clearly in one-to-one correspondence with the balls. Geometrically, this corresponds to drawing planes x=constant, x+y=constant, and x+y+z=constant through a given ball, and seeing where these planes intersect the x axis. (To compare with the case $k=2$, \"straighten\" the picture above into a right triangle. Then the diagonal lines become lines x=constant and x+y=constant, and the bottom row of balls (the blue ones) can be identified with the points where these lines intersect the x axis.) This also works in higher dimensions, giving $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$. Whether this proof really is any different from the one you suggested in the question can of course be debated...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about generalizing a geometric proof for triangular numbers to higher dimensions, specifically for simplex numbers. The example given for k=3 is that the n-th pyramidal number is binomial(n+2, 3). \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The original problem mentions k-dimensional simplex numbers. The user references the formula for the n-th k-simplex number as the number of non-negative integer solutions to x_0 + ... + x_k = n. But in the example for k=3, it's binomial(n+2,3), which aligns with the formula for combinations with repetition, usually given by binomial(n + k - 1, k - 1) or binomial(n + k, k) depending on the setup. Wait, for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x_0 + ... + x_k = n, that's binomial(n + k, k). So the formula here might be binomial(n + k - 1, k), but in the example, k=3 gives binomial(n+2,3). Hmm, so maybe the k-simplex number is binomial(n + k - 1, k). Let me confirm: for k=1 (linear), the numbers are binomial(n,1) = n, which is correct. For k=2 (triangular numbers), binomial(n+1,2) which is correct. For k=3 (tetrahedral numbers), binomial(n+2,3), which matches. So yes, the formula is binomial(n + k -1, k). \n\nThe problem is to prove this formula using a geometric bijective proof similar to the one for triangular numbers. The user mentions that one obvious proof is using the stars and bars method (characterizing each ball by its coordinates), but they want a different geometric approach. The original proof for triangular numbers probably involved arranging dots in a triangle and showing a bijection or geometric summation. So the task is to generalize that to k dimensions.\n\nAssumptions need to be listed one by one. The problem is about k-dimensional simplex numbers, so the first assumption is that we're dealing with a k-dimensional simplex. Then, the n-th simplex number is defined as the number of non-negative integer solutions to x_0 + ... + x_k = n. Alternatively, the problem statement might take the definition as the number of points in a k-simplex grid, which corresponds to that combinatorial formula. But the user explicitly states the formula for k=3 and wants to prove the general case. The problem's main goal is to prove that the n-th k-simplex number is binomial(n + k, k). Wait, wait, in the example for k=3, it's binomial(n+2,3), which is binomial(n + 3 -1, 3). So the general formula is binomial(n + k -1, k). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as binomial(n + k, k) but shifted. Need to check standard definitions. \n\nWait, the standard formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x_0 + x_1 + ... + x_k = n is binomial(n + k, k). But in the problem statement, the user says for k=3, it's binomial(n+2,3). That would correspond to solutions of x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = n (since k=3 implies 4 variables?), which would be binomial(n + 3, 3). Wait, maybe there's confusion in the indexing. Let me clarify. \n\nA k-dimensional simplex (k-simplex) is a k-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its k+1 vertices. So in terms of coordinates, as the user mentioned, a k-simplex in R^{k+1} is defined by x_0 + ... + x_k = 1, x_i >=0. The n-th k-simplex number is the number of non-negative integer solutions to x_0 + ... + x_k = n. Wait, but if the equation is x_0 + ... + x_k = n, then the number of solutions is binomial(n + k, k). So the formula should be binomial(n + k, k). However, in the example given for k=3 (3-simplex, tetrahedral numbers), the formula is binomial(n + 2, 3). Wait, binomial(n + 2, 3) is equal to (n+2)(n+1)n / 6, which is indeed the formula for the tetrahedral numbers. But according to the stars and bars formula, the number of solutions to x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = n (which is 4 variables) is binomial(n + 4 -1, 4 -1) = binomial(n + 3, 3). Wait, that contradicts. So there's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is using k to denote the dimension of the simplex, which in mathematical terms is a k-dimensional object, so a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron, which is 3-dimensional. But in terms of the equation, a k-dimensional simplex in R^{k+1} is defined by x_0 + ... + x_k = 1. So for the number of integer solutions to x_0 + ... + x_k = n, with x_i >=0, the formula is binomial(n + k, k). However, the tetrahedral numbers (3-simplex numbers) are binomial(n + 2, 3). That would suggest that maybe the formula is binomial(n + k -1, k). So for k=3, binomial(n + 2, 3). Hence, perhaps the formula is binomial(n + k -1, k). So that must be the case here. Therefore, the general formula is binomial(n + k -1, k). \n\nSo the problem is to prove that the n-th k-simplex number, defined as the number of non-negative integer solutions to x_0 + ... + x_k = n, is equal to binomial(n + k -1, k). But wait, that contradicts the standard stars and bars formula. Wait, stars and bars formula says that the number of non-negative integer solutions to x_1 + ... + x_m = n is binomial(n + m -1, m -1). So if we have k+1 variables x_0 to x_k, then the number of solutions is binomial(n + k, k). So if the problem states that for k=3, it's binomial(n + 2,3), that would imply m=3 variables (x_0 + x_1 + x_2 =n), leading to binomial(n +2, 2), which is different. There's some confusion here. \n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Let's check the example given: \"the statement for k=3 is that n-th pyramidal number is binomial(n+2,3)\". The pyramidal number (tetrahedral number) is indeed binomial(n+2,3). For example, when n=1, binomial(3,3)=1; n=2, binomial(4,3)=4, etc. But according to stars and bars, if we have x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 =n, the number of solutions is binomial(n + 3,3). But the tetrahedral numbers are binomial(n +2, 3). So perhaps the problem is considering the number of solutions to x_0 + x_1 + x_2 =n, which would be binomial(n + 2,2). Wait, no. Wait, the tetrahedral numbers are the sum of triangular numbers, which are themselves binomial(n+1,2). So the tetrahedral number is sum_{i=1}^n binomial(i+1,2) = binomial(n+2,3). So in that case, the formula is binomial(n +2,3). But how does that correspond to the number of solutions of an equation? \n\nPerhaps the user is using a different indexing. Let me think. If the problem is about k-dimensional simplex numbers, then for k=1 (line), the numbers are binomial(n,1)=n; for k=2 (triangle), binomial(n+1,2); for k=3 (tetrahedron), binomial(n+2,3). So generalizing, the formula is binomial(n + k -1, k). But how does that correspond to the number of solutions to x_0 + ... + x_k = n? If we have k+1 variables, then according to stars and bars, the number is binomial(n + k, k). Hence, there's a discrepancy. \n\nThis suggests that the problem might not be directly about the number of solutions to x_0 + ... + x_k =n, but perhaps a different interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of lattice points in a dilated k-simplex. The standard k-simplex is defined by x_0 + ... + x_k =1, x_i >=0. If we dilate it by a factor of n, then the equation becomes x_0 + ... + x_k =n, and the number of integer points is binomial(n +k, k). But the tetrahedral number is binomial(n +2,3), which would correspond to k=3, but binomial(n +3,3). Therefore, the user's example contradicts that. \n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between the dimension of the simplex and the number of variables. A k-simplex is in (k+1)-dimensional space but is k-dimensional. So maybe the formula is adjusted accordingly. For example, in 3D space (k=3), the 2-simplex is a triangle (x_0 +x_1 +x_2=1), and the number of solutions to x_0 +x_1 +x_2 =n would be binomial(n +2,2). But the 3-simplex is a tetrahedron in 4D space (x_0 +x_1 +x_2 +x_3=1), and the number of solutions to x_0 +x_1 +x_2 +x_3 =n is binomial(n +3,3). \n\nBut the example given by the user for k=3 is binomial(n +2,3), which is the tetrahedral number. But according to stars and bars, in 4 variables (3-simplex in 4D), it should be binomial(n +3,3). Therefore, there's inconsistency here. The user might have a different definition. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the number of points in a k-simplex in (k+1)-dimensional space, but scaled such that the sum is n. Then, the number would be binomial(n +k, k). But the example given for k=3 is binomial(n +2,3). So unless n is shifted, perhaps n' =n -1. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the number of points in a (k-1)-simplex. For example, the triangular numbers are for k=2 (2-simplex), which would correspond to the equation x_0 +x_1 +x_2 =n, giving binomial(n +2,2). But that's not matching the example. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me look back at the original question. The user says: \"k-simplex is the subset x_0 + ... +x_k =1, x_i >=0 in R^{k+1}, and n-th k-simplex number is the number of non-negative integer solutions of x_0 + ... +x_k =n\". Wait, if that's the case, then the number of solutions is indeed binomial(n +k, k). So for k=3, it's binomial(n +3,3). But the user says that for k=3, the n-th pyramidal number is binomial(n +2,3). This inconsistency suggests that either the user has a different definition, or there's a mistake. \n\nBut given that the user provides the example, I have to follow their lead. They say that for k=3, the formula is binomial(n +2,3). Therefore, perhaps in their definition, the k-simplex number is the number of solutions to x_0 + ... +x_{k} =n in non-negative integers, but with the indices shifted. For example, k=3 corresponds to 3 variables, not 4. If so, then the equation would be x_0 +x_1 +x_2 =n, which would have binomial(n +2,2) solutions, but they state binomial(n +2,3). Hmm, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is binomial(n +k -1, k). For k=3, binomial(n +2,3), which is the case. So general formula is binomial(n +k -1, k). But how does this relate to the number of solutions? If it's binomial(n +k -1, k), then that would correspond to solutions of x_1 +x_2 + ... +x_{k+1} =n, which is binomial(n +k, k). Wait, maybe the user is considering a different equation. \n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me proceed with the information given. The user says that for k=3, the formula is binomial(n +2,3), which is the standard tetrahedral number. The problem is to prove that the n-th k-simplex number is binomial(n +k -1, k) using a geometric proof similar to the triangular number proof. The assumptions would include:\n\n- The k-simplex is defined as the set of points in R^{k+1} satisfying x_0 + ... +x_k =1, x_i >=0.\n\n- The n-th k-simplex number is the number of non-negative integer solutions to x_0 + ... +x_k =n.\n\n- The problem seeks a geometric/bijective proof of the formula, not the standard combinatorial (stars and bars) proof.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe k-simplex is the subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ defined by $x_0 + \\dots + x_k = 1$ with $x_i \\ge 0$,\nThe n-th k-simplex number is the number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_0 + \\dots + x_k = n$,\nThe proof should be geometric/bijective and not rely on combinatorial arguments like stars and bars.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the n-th k-simplex number is $\\dbinom{n + k - 1}{k}$ using a geometric approach similar to the proof for triangular numbers.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem uses k=3 leading to $\\dbinom{n + 2}{3}$, which is $\\dbinom{n + 3 -1}{3}$. So yes, the general formula is $\\dbinom{n + k -1}{k}$. So that's the problem.\n\nBut in standard terms, the number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_0 + \\dots +x_k =n$ is $\\dbinom{n +k}{k}$, but here it's claimed as $\\dbinom{n +k -1}{k}$. This discrepancy must be because of a difference in indexing. For instance, if the problem is counting the number of solutions to $x_1 + \\dots +x_{k} =n$, then it's $\\dbinom{n +k -1}{k -1}$. But the user mentions k-simplex numbers as the number of solutions to $x_0 + \\dots +x_k =n$, which should be $\\dbinom{n +k}{k}$. However, their example for k=3 is $\\dbinom{n +2}{3}$, which suggests that maybe in their definition, the number is $\\dbinom{n +k -1}{k}$. This inconsistency needs to be addressed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula the user is referencing is for the (n-1)-th k-simplex number. For example, if n=1 gives 1, which would be $\\dbinom{1 +k -1}{k} = \\dbinom{k}{k} =1$. But in standard definitions, the first tetrahedral number (n=1) is 1, which is $\\dbinom{1 +2}{3} = \\dbinom{3}{3}=1$. So that works. For n=2, $\\dbinom{2 +2}{3} =4$, which is correct. So perhaps the formula is indeed $\\dbinom{n +k -1}{k}$. Therefore, the problem is to prove that the number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_0 + \\dots +x_k =n$ is $\\dbinom{n +k}{k}$ using a geometric method. But the user's example uses k=3 and formula $\\dbinom{n +2}{3}$, which would be if k=3 and the equation is $x_0 +x_1 +x_2 =n$, which has $\\dbinom{n +2}{2}$ solutions. Wait, confusion reigns.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the user's explicit example and the formula they provided. The key points from the problem statement:\n\n- The problem is about k-dimensional simplex numbers.\n\n- The formula to prove is the n-th k-simplex number is $\\dbinom{n + k -1}{k}$.\n\n- The proof should be geometric, similar to the triangular number proof, not combinatorial.\n\nAssumptions would then be:\n\n1. A k-dimensional simplex is defined as the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ satisfying $x_0 + \\dots + x_k = 1$ with $x_i \\ge 0$.\n\n2. The n-th k-simplex number counts the number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_0 + \\dots + x_k = n$.\n\n3. The proof should avoid combinatorial arguments like stars and bars and instead use a geometric/bijective approach.\n\nProblem: Prove that the n-th k-simplex number is $\\dbinom{n + k -1}{k}$ using a geometric method analogous to the proof for triangular numbers.\n\nBut wait, the standard formula for the number of non-negative solutions to $x_0 + ... +x_k =n$ is $\\dbinom{n +k}{k}$. So either the user has a different indexing, or there's a mistake. To resolve this, perhaps the user is actually considering the number of solutions to $x_1 + ... +x_{k+1} =n-1$ or something similar. Alternatively, maybe they shifted n. Given the example for k=3, $\\dbinom{n +2}{3}$, which is the same as $\\dbinom{n +3 -1}{3}$, which would fit $\\dbinom{n +k -1}{k}$ if k=3. So the general formula is $\\dbinom{n +k -1}{k}$. Therefore, the problem is to prove that formula.\n\nSo, wrapping up, the assumptions are:\n\n- The k-simplex is defined in $\\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ by $x_0 + ... +x_k =1$, $x_i \\ge 0$.\n\n- The n-th k-simplex number is defined as the number of non-negative integer solutions to $x_0 + ... +x_k =n$.\n\n- The proof must be geometric/bijective, not combinatorial.\n\nProblem: Prove that the n-th k-simplex number is $\\dbinom{n +k -1}{k}$.\n\nBut to check, let's verify with k=3. If n=1: solutions to x0+x1+x2+x3=1, which is 4 solutions, but $\\dbinom{1+3-1}{3} = \\dbinom{3}{3}=1$, which is incorrect. Wait, that can't be. So this suggests a problem. There's a fundamental mistake here. The number of non-negative integer solutions to x0+...+xk =n is indeed binomial(n +k, k). For example, k=3 (4 variables), n=1: binomial(1+3,3)=4, which is correct. However, the user's example says for k=3, it's binomial(n+2,3). For n=1, binomial(3,3)=1, which doesn't match the actual number of solutions. Hence, there must be a different definition in play here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the number of lattice points in the simplex defined by x0 + ... +xk <=n, which would be binomial(n +k, k). But if it's x0 + ... +xk =n, then it's binomial(n +k, k). But their example for k=3 is binomial(n +2,3), which doesn't align. Therefore, I must conclude that the user has a different definition, possibly considering the number of solutions in positive integers, but that would be binomial(n-1 +k, k). For example, if variables are positive integers, the number of solutions to x0 + ... +xk =n is binomial(n-1, k). But that doesn't match either.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be about the number of points in a k-dimensional grid up to n layers, which for k=1 is n, k=2 is triangular number n(n+1)/2, k=3 is tetrahedral number n(n+1)(n+2)/6, which is binomial(n+2,3). So the formula for k-dimensional simplex numbers is binomial(n +k -1, k). For example, k=1: binomial(n +0,1)=n, k=2: binomial(n+1,2), k=3: binomial(n+2,3). So in this case, the formula is indeed binomial(n +k -1, k). Therefore, the problem is to prove that the n-th k-simplex number (defined as the number of points in a k-dimensional simplex grid up to layer n) is binomial(n +k -1, k) using a geometric proof.\n\nGiven this, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The problem concerns k-dimensional simplex numbers.\n\n- The n-th k-simplex number is defined analogously to triangular numbers (k=2) and tetrahedral numbers (k=3).\n\n- The formula to prove is $\\dbinom{n +k -1}{k}$.\n\n- The proof must be geometric, not relying on combinatorial enumeration like stars and bars.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe problem concerns k-dimensional simplex numbers,\nThe n-th k-simplex number is defined geometrically analogous to triangular and tetrahedral numbers,\nA geometric or bijective proof is required without using combinatorial arguments.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the n-th k-simplex number is $\\dbinom{n + k - 1}{k}$ using a geometric approach similar to the proof for triangular numbers.\n\nBut to align with the example provided in the user's question, which mentions k=3 gives binomial(n +2,3), and the problem statement in the example lists assumptions about divisibility, here the key assumptions are about the definition of the simplex numbers and the method of proof. The original problem in the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but here the assumptions are more about the definitions and the method.",
