    "Content": "Let $f(x)$ be a monotone non-increasing function such that $\\int_{0}^{\\infty}f(x) dx$ converges. Prove: $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} xf(x)=0$. My question is, why can't I simply contradict any other possibility by using the Integral Limit Comparison Test with $1\\over x$? I am, after all, to show that $f(x)=o(x)$ as $x\\to \\infty$. I really don't understand why monotony is crucial here. I could use some help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I assume that $f$ is non-negative (this is justified; see the end of the post for the somewhat tedious details). If $\\int_0^{\\infty}f(t)\\,\\mathrm dt$ converges, then, for each $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists some $x_0>0$ such that $y>x_0$ implies that $$\\int_y^{\\infty}f(t)\\,\\mathrm dt<\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}.\\tag{1}$$ I will show that if $x>2x_0$, then $xf(x)<\\varepsilon$, which will prove that claim that $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}xf(x)=0$. Suppose that $x>2x_0$. Then, one has that\n\\begin{align*}\nxf(x)=&\\,2\\frac{x}{2}f(x)=2\\left(x-\\frac{x}{2}\\right)f(x)=2f(x)\\int_{x/2}^x\\,\\mathrm dt=2\\int_{x/2}^xf(x)\\,\\mathrm dt\\\\\n\\underset{\\spadesuit}\\leq&\\,2\\int_{x/2}^xf(t)\\,\\mathrm dt\\leq2\\int_{x/2}^{\\infty}f(t)\\,\\mathrm dt\\underset{\\heartsuit}<2\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}=\\varepsilon.\n\\end{align*}\nIn this chain of inequalities, $\\spadesuit$ follows from the fact that $f$ is non-increasing, so that $f(x)\\leq f(t)$ for all $t\\in[x/2,x]$; and $\\heartsuit$ follows from (1), given that $x/2>x_0$. The convergence of $\\int_0^{\\infty} f(t)\\,\\mathrm dt$ and the monotonicity of $f$ necessarily imply that $f(t)\\geq0$ for all $t\\geq0$. To see this, suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $f(t_0)<0$ for some $t_0\\geq 0$. Let\n\\begin{align*}\nK\\equiv&-f(t_0)>0.\n\\end{align*}\nLet $M>0$ be an arbitrarily large positive number and choose some positive number $H$ sufficiently large so that $$H\\geq\\frac{t_0f(0)+M}{K}\\tag{2}.$$\nFinally, suppose that $x>t_0+H$. Then, one has that\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^xf(t)\\,\\mathrm dt=&\\,\\int_0^{t_0}f(t)\\,\\mathrm dt+\\int_{t_0}^xf(t)\\,\\mathrm  dt\\underset{\\clubsuit}{\\leq}t_0f(0)+(x-t_0)f(t_0)=t_0 f(0)-(x-t_0)K\\\\\n<&\\,t_0 f(0)-HK\\leq t_0 f(0)-[t_0 f(0)+M]=-M,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\clubsuit$ follows again from the fact that $f$ is non-increasing. Since $M$ can be arbitrarily large, it follows that $$\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\int_0^xf(t)\\,\\mathrm dt=-\\infty,$$ which contradicts the convergence of $\\int_0^{\\infty} f(t)\\,\\mathrm dt$. As the counterexamples in the comments reveal, monotonicity is indispensable. Indeed, I used them at two crucial steps: at $\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is about proving that the limit of x times f(x) as x approaches infinity is zero, given that the integral of f(x) from 0 to infinity converges. The user is asking why they can't use the Integral Limit Comparison Test with 1/x and why monotonicity is crucial here.\n\nSo, the original problem is to prove that lim_{x→∞} x f(x) = 0 given that f is monotone non-increasing and the integral of f converges. The user is confused about the role of monotonicity and wants to use a comparison test.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The function f(x) is monotone non-increasing. So that's one assumption about f's monotonicity.\n2. The integral of f(x) from 0 to infinity converges. That's another assumption about the convergence of the integral.\n3. The problem is to prove that the limit of x f(x) as x approaches infinity is zero.\n\nWait, the original question mentions using the Integral Limit Comparison Test with 1/x, but the user is confused why that's not possible. However, the problem as stated by the user includes the assumptions of f being monotone non-increasing and the integral converging. The problem statement is to prove the limit is zero. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list those two points: monotonicity and integral convergence.\n\nBut the example given in the initial prompt had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. Here, the function f has two properties: monotonicity and the integral convergence. So each of those should be separate.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is a monotone non-increasing function,\nThe integral of f(x) from 0 to ∞ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that lim_{x→∞} x f(x) = 0.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property. The problem statement is the conclusion to prove. The user's confusion about the comparison test and monotonicity is part of their question but not part of the problem's assumptions. The original problem as posed by the user includes the two assumptions (monotonicity and convergence of the integral), and the problem is to prove the limit. So the formatted problem should capture those two assumptions and the problem statement.",
