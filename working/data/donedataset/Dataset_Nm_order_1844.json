    "Content": "Prove that the ring of integers of $\\mathbb Q (\\sqrt{-5})$ does not have unique factorisation. Since $-5\\equiv 3\\pmod 4$, I know that the ring of integers of $\\mathbb Q (\\sqrt{-5})$ is $\\mathbb Z [\\sqrt{-5}]$. I assume the way to prove that this does not have a unique factorisation is to give two different factorisations, but what exactly do I use to factorise? Do I consider the polynomial $x+\\sqrt{-5}$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In a UFD, an element is irreducible if and only if it is prime. Observe that $2$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb Z + \\mathbb Z\\sqrt{-5}$ : Suppose $$2 = (a + b \\sqrt{-5})(c + b \\sqrt{-5}),$$ taking the norm of both sides gives us $$4 = (a^2 + 5b^2)(c^2 + 5d^2)$$ which means $a^2 + 5b^2 = 1, 2$ or $4$ . If $a^2 + 5b^2 = 1$ , then $a = 1$ and $b = 0$ which means $a + b \\sqrt{-5} = 1$ which is a unit and we're done. If $a^2 + 5b^2 = 4$ , then $a = 2$ and $b = 0$ which means $$c + d \\sqrt{-5} = \\frac{2}{a + b\\sqrt{-5}} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1,$$ a unit, which means we're done. Notice that $a^2 + 5b^2 = 2$ can never happen: $b$ will have to be zero because if it's not, then the sum is greater than 5, which means it's greater than $2$ , which means $a^2 = 2$ which only holds when $a = \\sqrt 2 \\notin \\mathbb Z$ , so this case can't occur. Conclude by definition that $2$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb Z + \\mathbb Z \\sqrt{-5}$ . Observe that $2 \\mid 6 = (1 + \\sqrt{-5})(1 - \\sqrt{-5})$ but $2 \\nmid (1 + \\sqrt{-5}), (1 - \\sqrt{-5})$ . Say, by way of contradiction, that $2 \\mid 1 + \\sqrt{-5}$ , then there exist $a, b \\in \\mathbb Z$ such that $1 + \\sqrt{-5} = 2(a + b \\sqrt{-5})$ which means $2a = 1$ and $2b = 1$ which can only happen if $a = b = 1/2 \\notin \\mathbb Z$ , a contradiction. Similar reasoning works for $1  - \\sqrt{-5}$ . Conclude that $2$ is not prime, but it is irreducible. Hence we're not in a unique factorization domain.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem about proving that the ring of integers of Q(√-5) is not a UFD. Let me start by understanding the original question. The user mentions that since -5 ≡ 3 mod 4, the ring of integers is Z[√-5]. They want to show this ring isn't a UFD by providing two different factorizations. The user is confused about what elements to factorize.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states that the ring of integers is Z[√-5] because -5 ≡ 3 mod 4. So one assumption is about the ring being Z[√-5]. Then, the main problem is to prove that this ring doesn't have unique factorization. \n\nIn the example given earlier, assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are the ring in question is Z[√-5], and perhaps that we are working in the context of ring theory where unique factorization is considered. But maybe the only explicit assumption is the ring itself. The user also mentions they need to find two different factorizations, so maybe there's an assumption that such elements exist in the ring. However, the problem itself is just to prove the ring isn't a UFD, so the main assumption is the ring is Z[√-5], and the problem is to show it lacks unique factorization.\n\nThe user is asking about specific elements to factor. The classic example in Z[√-5] is 6, which can be factored as 2*3 and (1+√-5)(1-√-5). Both factorizations into irreducibles, but none of the factors are associates, hence different factorizations. So the problem is to present these factorizations and show they are indeed irreducible and distinct.\n\nSo structuring this: Assumptions would include that the ring of integers is Z[√-5], and maybe each element involved (like 6, 2, 3, etc.) are elements of this ring. But since the problem is general, the main assumption is the ring itself. The problem is to prove that this ring doesn't have unique factorization, likely by exhibiting those distinct factorizations.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Prove that the ring of integers of Q(√-5) does not have unique factorisation.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- The ring of integers of Q(√-5) is Z[√-5]. (Because -5 ≡ 3 mod 4)\n- The definition of unique factorization domain (maybe implicitly, but perhaps not needed in assumptions)\nBut according to the example, assumptions are conditions applied to one object. So the first assumption is about the ring being Z[√-5]. Then, maybe the problem is to show it's not a UFD. But maybe there's another assumption, like considering certain elements in the ring? Hmm.\n\nIn the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the only assumption is the ring is Z[√-5]. The problem is to prove it's not a UFD. So maybe the assumptions are just the ring's structure, and the problem is the proof. Then, the user's question is about how to factorize, which is part of solving the problem, not the assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring of integers of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ does not have unique factorisation.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"Prove that the ring of integers...\", so maybe the assumption is that -5 ≡3 mod 4, hence the ring is Z[√-5]. But the user already states that part as given. So maybe the assumption is that -5 ≡3 mod 4, leading to the ring being Z[√-5]. But in the example, they listed the assumptions as properties on the variable n. Here, the key assumption is about the ring of integers being Z[√-5], which is due to the congruence condition. However, the user already states that they know the ring is Z[√-5] because of the modulo condition. So perhaps the assumption here is that the ring of integers is Z[√-5], and the problem is to prove it's not a UFD. Alternatively, if we take the problem as given, maybe the only assumption is the ring itself. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the user included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So, all conditions leading to the problem's setup. Here, the problem's setup requires knowing the ring is Z[√-5], which is due to -5 ≡3 mod 4. But if the user already states that as known, perhaps the assumption is just the ring being Z[√-5]. Alternatively, if we need to include why the ring is Z[√-5], but in the example, they didn't include the reason why n is divisible by 7, just stated it as an assumption. So maybe the assumption here is:\n\n- The ring of integers of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ does not have unique factorisation.\n\nThen, in the problem statement, the user wants to show this by providing two different factorizations. So the answer would involve elements like 6, 2, 3, 1+√-5, etc., but those are part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the assumption about the ring's structure and then the problem to prove it's not a UFD.",
