    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether a continuous function f(x) that satisfies f(x) = f(2x) for all real x must necessarily be a constant function. They also want to know the proof or a counterexample if it's not true.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that f is continuous, and for every real x, f(x) = f(2x). The question is if f has to be constant. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for this problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f is a continuous function.\n2. For all real x, f(x) = f(2x).\n\nWait, but in the example, sometimes they split into separate lines even if they apply to the same object. Here, continuity is one property of f, and the functional equation is another. So yes, two separate assumptions.\n\nThe problem part is asking if f must be constant. So the problem statement is: \"Prove that f(x) is a constant function.\"\n\nBut wait, the original question is phrased as \"does f(x) necessarily have to be a constant function? If so, how do you prove it? If not any counter examples?\" So maybe the problem should be phrased as \"Determine whether f(x) must be a constant function, and prove it or provide a counterexample.\" But the example given in the user's instruction was straightforward, like \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the user's formatted problem listed n is an integer, then n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the user formatted it with assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but that's not part of the original problem. Wait, maybe that's a mistake in the example. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal problem example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nBut the formatted problem has assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", meaning the only assumption is n is integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, according to the user's instruction, we need to list all assumptions from the problem. In the given example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption is n is an integer, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7. Maybe the user's example was incorrect, but I should follow their structure.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question says: \"If a Continuous function f(x) satisfies f(x) = f(2x), for all real x, then does f(x) necessarily have to be constant function?\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is continuous.\n2. For all real x, f(x) = f(2x).\n\nThe problem is to determine if f must be constant, with proof or counterexample. But according to the user's desired format, the problem should be stated as a directive like \"Prove that f(x) is a constant function\" if the answer is yes, or \"Determine if f(x) is necessarily a constant function\" if it's a yes/no with proof or counterexample.\n\nBut the example given by the user had a problem statement that was a directive: \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So maybe here, if the answer is yes, the problem should be \"Prove that f(x) is a constant function.\"\n\nBut the original question is phrased as a yes/no question. However, according to the user's example, they rephrased the original problem (which was a \"prove for every integer n\") into an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which may not be correct. Wait, maybe there was a misunderstanding. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems wrong because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7, which isn't in the original problem. So maybe the example is incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to present a problem where the assumption is that n is divisible by 7, but that's conflicting.\n\nAnyway, regardless of that example's accuracy, I need to focus on the current problem. The user's question is: If a continuous function f satisfies f(x) = f(2x) for all real x, must it be constant? The answer is yes, but the user wants the problem structured as Assumptions and Problem.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is continuous.\n2. For all real x, f(x) = f(2x).\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is a constant function.\n\nAlternatively, if the original question is whether it must be constant, then the problem could be phrased as \"Determine whether f(x) is necessarily a constant function.\" But according to the example, the problem is phrased as a directive (\"Prove that...\") if the answer is affirmative. Since in reality, the answer is yes, the function must be constant, so the problem can be stated as \"Prove that f(x) is a constant function.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have two assumptions and the problem statement as proving it's constant.",
