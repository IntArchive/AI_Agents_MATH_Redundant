    "Content": "The evaluation, $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{F_{2^n}}=\\frac{7-\\sqrt{5}}{2}=\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^3+\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^2$$ was recently asked in a post by Chris here . I like generalizations, and it turns out this is not a unique feature of the Fibonacci numbers. If we use the Pell numbers $P_m = 1,2,5,12,29,70,\\dots$ then the sum is also an algebraic number of deg 2. In general, it seems for any positive rational b , then, $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b^2+4}}\\left( \\left(\\frac{b+\\sqrt{b^2+4}}{2}\\right)^{2^n}-\\left(\\frac{b-\\sqrt{b^2+4}}{2}\\right)^{2^n}\\right)}=1+\\frac{2}{b}+\\frac{b-\\sqrt{b^2+4}}{2}$$ where Fibonacci numbers are just the case b = 1, the Pell numbers b = 2, and so on. (For negative rational b , then one just uses the positive case of $\\pm\\sqrt{b^2+4}$.) Anyone knows how to prove/disprove the conjectured evaluation?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your conjecture is indeed right. Before proving your conjecture, let us obtain an intermediate result first. Let us prove the following claim first. CLAIM : If we have a sequence given by the recurrence,\n$$a_{n+2} = ba_{n+1} + a_n,$$ with $a_0 =0 $ and $a_1 = 1$, we then have\n$$\\boxed{\\color{blue}{\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{N} \\dfrac1{a_{2^k}} = 1 + \\dfrac2b - \\dfrac{a_{2^N-1}}{a_{2^N}}}}$$ Proof :\nLet us write out a few terms of this sequence, we get\n$$a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = b, a_3 = b^2 + 1, a_4 = b^3 + 2b, \\cdots$$\nThe proof is by induction on $N$. For $N=1$, we have the left hand side to be $$\\dfrac1{a_1} + \\dfrac1{a_2} = 1 + \\dfrac1b$$ while the right hand side is $$1 + \\dfrac2b - \\dfrac{a_1}{a_2} = 1 + \\dfrac2b - \\dfrac1{b} = 1 + \\dfrac1b$$\nFor $N=2$, we have the left hand side to be $$\\dfrac1{a_1} + \\dfrac1{a_2} + \\dfrac1{a_4} = 1 + \\dfrac1b + \\dfrac1{b^3 + 2b}$$ while the right hand side is $$1 + \\dfrac2b - \\dfrac{a_3}{a_4} = 1 + \\dfrac2b - \\dfrac{b^2+1}{b^3+2b} = 1 + \\dfrac1b + \\dfrac1b - \\dfrac{b^2+1}{b^3+2b} = 1 + \\dfrac1b + \\dfrac1{b^3+2b}$$ Hence, it holds for $N=1$ and $N=2$. Now lets go ahead with induction now. Assume the result is true for $N=m$ i.e. we have\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{m} \\dfrac1{a_{2^k}} = 1 + \\dfrac2b - \\dfrac{a_{2^m-1}}{a_{2^m}}$$\nNow $$\\sum_{k=0}^{m+1} \\dfrac1{a_{2^k}} = 1 + \\dfrac2b - \\dfrac{a_{2^m-1}}{a_{2^m}} + \\dfrac1{a_{2^{m+1}}}$$ Hence, we want to show that\n$$ - \\dfrac{a_{2^m-1}}{a_{2^m}} + \\dfrac1{a_{2^{m+1}}} = -\\dfrac{a_{2^{m+1}-1}}{a_{2^{m+1}}}$$\ni.e.\n$$\\dfrac1{a_{2^{m+1}}} + \\dfrac{a_{2^{m+1}-1}}{a_{2^{m+1}}} =  \\dfrac{a_{2^m-1}}{a_{2^m}}$$\ni.e.\n$$a_{2^m}(1+a_{2^{m+1}-1}) = a_{2^m-1} a_{2^{m+1}} \\,\\,\\,\\, (\\star)$$\nwhich can be verified using the recurrence. In fact $(\\dagger)$, a slightly more general version of $(\\star)$, which is easier to check is true.\n$$a_{2k}(1+a_{4k-1}) = a_{2k-1} a_{4k} \\,\\,\\,\\, (\\dagger)$$ i.e.\n$$a_{2k-1} a_{4k} - a_{2k} a_{4k-1} = a_{2k} \\,\\,\\,\\, (\\dagger)$$\nHence, we get that\n$$\\boxed{\\color{red}{\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{N} \\dfrac1{a_{2^k}} = 1 + \\dfrac2b - \\dfrac{a_{2^N-1}}{a_{2^N}}}}$$ Now letting $N \\to \\infty$, we see that your conjecture is indeed right. This is so since\nfrom the recurrence we get that\n$$\\dfrac{a_{n+2}}{a_{n+1}} = b + \\dfrac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}$$\nIf we have $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} = L$, then we get that\n$$\\dfrac1L = b + L$$ and since $L>0$, we have $L = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{b^2+4}-b}2$. Hence,\n$$\\boxed{\\color{red}{\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac1{a_{2^k}} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{N} \\dfrac1{a_{2^k}} = 1 + \\dfrac2b - \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\dfrac{a_{2^N-1}}{a_{2^N}} = 1 + \\dfrac2b - L = 1 + \\dfrac2b + \\dfrac{b}2 -\\dfrac{\\sqrt{b^2+4}}2}}$$ EDIT After some googling, I found out that a similar result is true for a more general class of recurrences of the form $$a_{n+1} = P a_n + Q a_{n-1}$$ See this article for more details. Also, try googling Millin series for more details.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about a generalized sum involving Fibonacci numbers, Pell numbers, and a more general case with a rational parameter b. The task is to prove or disprove the conjectured evaluation of the infinite sum.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem mentions several things: the sum over n starting from 0 to infinity, the terms involve reciprocals of expressions related to a sequence defined using b. The Fibonacci case is when b=1, Pell when b=2, etc. Also, it mentions that for negative rational b, one uses the positive case of sqrt(b²+4). So, the assumptions should cover the conditions on b, the form of the general term in the sum, and possibly the convergence or structure of the series.\n\nWait, the problem states that for any positive rational b, the sum equals 1 + 2/b + (b - sqrt(b²+4))/2. The user is asking to prove or disprove this. So the assumptions would include that b is a positive rational number, and that the terms in the sum are defined as per the given expression involving b and 2^n exponents.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the Fibonacci case is b=1, Pell numbers b=2, etc., but those are specific instances. The main assumption is about the general case with positive rational b. Also, the expression inside the sum's denominator is a specific form derived from the recurrence relation, using the roots of the characteristic equation. For Fibonacci, the golden ratio and its conjugate. Similarly, here they have ( (b + sqrt(b²+4))/2 )^{2^n} - the other root term, scaled by 1/sqrt(b²+4).\n\nSo, listing the assumptions step by step:\n\n1. b is a positive rational number. (Since the problem states \"for any positive rational b\")\n\n2. Each term of the series is 1 divided by [ (1/sqrt(b² + 4)) * ( ((b + sqrt(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} - ((b - sqrt(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} ) ]\n\n3. The series is summed from n=0 to infinity. (Given by the summation notation)\n\nI think these are the key assumptions. The problem then is to prove or disprove the conjectured evaluation of that sum as 1 + 2/b + (b - sqrt(b² +4))/2.\n\nWait, the problem statement also mentions that for negative rational b, one uses the positive case of sqrt(b² +4), but since the user specifies \"for any positive rational b\", the assumption is about positive b. So the negative case is mentioned as a side note, but the main problem is about positive b. Hence, in the formatted problem, we only include the assumptions relevant to the main conjecture, which is for positive rational b.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- b is a positive rational number.\n\n- The series is ∑_{n=0}^∞ 1 / [ (1/√(b² +4)) ( ( (b + √(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} - ( (b - √(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} ) ]\n\nSo each term is as defined. Then the problem is to prove or disprove the sum equals the given expression.\n\nNow, checking the example given in the user's instruction. The original problem was about proving A(n) divisible by 91, but in the example, they listed assumptions as n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that example might not be correct. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error. So perhaps the example is not correct, but the user is using it as a sample. Therefore, I should proceed carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they list assumptions including that n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so perhaps there's an error here. Maybe the original problem had additional conditions, but the example provided by the user might have a mistake. However, I should not focus on that; instead, I need to process the current problem.\n\nSo, returning to the current problem. The problem as stated by the user on Math Stack Exchange is asking to prove or disprove that the infinite sum equals the given expression. The key elements are:\n\n- The sum from n=0 to infinity of 1 divided by [ (1/sqrt(b² +4)) ( ( (b + sqrt(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} - ( (b - sqrt(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} ) ]\n\n- For positive rational b.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. b is a positive rational number.\n\n2. Each term of the series is defined as the reciprocal of (1/sqrt(b² +4)) multiplied by the difference of the two terms raised to 2^n.\n\n3. The series is summed from n=0 to infinity.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem doesn't require assuming convergence, as it's part of the conjecture that the sum converges to that value. So perhaps the main assumptions are about b being positive rational and the form of the terms.\n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- b is a positive rational number.\n\n- For each non-negative integer n, the term of the series is 1 divided by [ (1/√(b² +4)) ( ( (b + √(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} - ( (b - √(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} ) ]\n\nProblem:\n\nProve or disprove that the sum equals 1 + 2/b + (b - √(b² +4))/2.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is defined as such, perhaps the assumption is about the general term's structure, and b being positive rational. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- b is a positive rational number.\n\n- The general term of the series is 1 divided by [ (1/√(b² +4)) ( ( (b + √(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} - ( (b - √(b² +4))/2 )^{2^n} ) ] for each non-negative integer n.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve or disprove that ∑_{n=0}^∞ [term] = 1 + 2/b + (b - √(b² +4))/2.\n\nYes, that's the structure. Each assumption is one line, each applies to one object. So the two assumptions: one on b, one on the term's definition. Then the problem is to evaluate the sum.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again. The problem statement in the original question includes the conjecture for any positive rational b, then the sum is equal to that expression. So the key conditions are that b is positive rational and the terms are defined as specified. The problem is to prove or disprove the equality.",
