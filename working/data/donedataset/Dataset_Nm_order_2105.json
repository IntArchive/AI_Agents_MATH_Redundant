I already know of a solution involving the fact that given two normal extension fields $M, L$ of some field $K$ contained in some common extension, then $\\text{Gal}(ML/L) \\cong \\text{Gal}(M/M \\cap L)$ , but does there exist a solution that doesn't require such a theorem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I included this exercise on an article I wrote (which I presume is where the question poser got this problem from if he's the same bzprules on Art of Problem Solving) for a reason: nothing advanced is needed. Just some tricky ideas. Denote $\\displaystyle \\omega_n = \\text{exp} \\left ( \\frac{2 \\pi i}{n} \\right)$. Denote $\\ell = \\text{lcm}[m,n]$ and $d = \\gcd(m,n)$. Let $F = \\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_n] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_m]$. Consider the automorphisms over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_\\ell]$ which fix $\\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_n]$. It is clear they are defined by $f_k : \\omega_{\\ell} \\to \\omega_{\\ell}^k$ where $\\gcd(k,\\ell) = 1$ and $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. Now for the tricky part of the proof : note that these are also automorphisms for $\\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_m]$ which fix $F$! It is clear that they fix $F$ due to $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$ (or more simply, its a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_n]$). To see that they also are isomorphisms on $\\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_m]$, just note its effectively exponentiating $\\omega_m$ by $k$ for $\\gcd(k,m) = 1$ so of course it works. It follows $$\\frac{\\phi(\\ell)}{\\phi(n)} = \\frac{\\phi(m)}{\\phi(d)} \\le [\\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_m]:F]$$\ndue to the fact there are at least $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\phi(\\ell)}{\\phi(n)}$ automorphisms. Thus $[F : \\mathbb{Q}] \\le \\phi(d) \\implies F = \\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_d]$ because that $[\\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_d] : \\mathbb{Q}] = \\phi(d)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}[\\omega_d] \\subset F$. The motivation behind this proof is that we need to bound $[F : \\mathbb{Q}]$ from above, so it is natural to consider $[K : F]$ for some field $K$. As cyclotomic fields have nice Galois groups, we can often bound the dimension by finding automorphisms.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the intersection of the m-th and n-th cyclotomic fields over Q is the cyclotomic field corresponding to the greatest common divisor of m and n, without using the theorem related to Galois groups of composite extensions. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what cyclotomic fields are. The n-th cyclotomic field Q(ζ_n) is generated by a primitive n-th root of unity ζ_n. These fields are abelian extensions of Q with Galois groups isomorphic to the multiplicative group modulo n, specifically (Z/nZ)^×. \n\nThe problem is about the intersection Q_m ∩ Q_n. The claim is that this intersection is Q_{(m,n)}, where (m,n) is the gcd of m and n. \n\nThe user mentions a known solution using Galois theory: if M and L are normal extensions of K, then Gal(ML/L) is isomorphic to Gal(M/(M∩L)). Applying this, since cyclotomic fields are abelian (hence normal over Q), taking M=Q_m and L=Q_n, then ML would be Q_lcm(m,n). Then Gal(ML/L) would be isomorphic to Gal(Q_m / (Q_m ∩ Q_n)). But maybe there's another way without invoking this theorem.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe use the structure of cyclotomic fields. Since Q_a is contained in Q_b if and only if a divides b or a is 1 mod something? Wait, actually, Q_a is contained in Q_b if and only if a divides b or b is even and a divides 2b. Wait, no, more precisely, Q_a ⊆ Q_b if and only if a divides b or a divides 2b and b is odd. Wait, actually, the inclusion of cyclotomic fields can be a bit tricky. Wait, the key fact is that Q_m ∩ Q_n is the largest cyclotomic field contained in both Q_m and Q_n. Since cyclotomic fields are ordered by divisibility, the intersection should correspond to the gcd. \n\nLet me think. Suppose d = (m,n). Then Q_d is contained in both Q_m and Q_n because d divides m and d divides n. Therefore, Q_d is a subset of Q_m ∩ Q_n. Now, we need to show that Q_m ∩ Q_n is contained in Q_d. Suppose an element x is in both Q_m and Q_n. Then x is in Q_m and Q_n. Since Q_m corresponds to ζ_m and Q_n to ζ_n, then x must be in the compositum Q_m ∩ Q_n. But maybe the compositum Q_m Q_n is Q_{lcm(m,n)}. Then, if we can show that the intersection is Q_d, which is the maximal cyclotomic field contained in both. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the intersection of Q_m and Q_n must be a cyclotomic field Q_k for some k. We need to find the largest such k that divides both m and n. That would be k = d. \n\nAnother angle: The degree [Q_m ∩ Q_n : Q] must divide both φ(m) and φ(n), so it divides φ(d). But since Q_d is already in the intersection, and [Q_d : Q] = φ(d), which is the maximum possible. Hence, the intersection must be Q_d.\n\nWait, but how to formalize this without using Galois theory? Maybe using the structure of roots of unity. If x is in both Q_m and Q_n, then x can be expressed in terms of ζ_m and also in terms of ζ_n. The minimal cyclotomic field containing x would have to be a common divisor of m and n. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, suppose ζ is a primitive d-th root of unity, where d = (m,n). Then Q_d is contained in both Q_m and Q_n. Conversely, if α is in Q_m ∩ Q_n, then α is in Q_m, so it's a combination of ζ_m, and also in Q_n, so combination of ζ_n. Since ζ_m has order m, ζ_n has order n. The intersection would be generated by elements that are roots of unity of order dividing both m and n, i.e., dividing d. Therefore, the intersection is Q_d.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the key idea is that elements in both Q_m and Q_n must be combinations of roots of unity of order dividing both m and n, hence their gcd. Therefore, the intersection is Q_{(m,n)}. \n\nBut to make this rigorous, perhaps using the fact that the compositum of Q_m and Q_n is Q_{lcm(m,n)}, and then considering the degrees. Alternatively, using that the intersection of two cyclotomic fields is the cyclotomic field generated by the gcd. \n\nHowever, the user wants a proof that doesn't use the theorem about Galois groups. So maybe using minimality and the structure of cyclotomic extensions. Since Q_d is the smallest cyclotomic field containing both ζ_d, and since d divides m and n, it's contained in both. Any element in the intersection must be in a cyclotomic field that's contained in both, which is at most Q_d. Therefore, equality holds.\n\nI think this approach works. Now, structuring the answer accordingly.",
