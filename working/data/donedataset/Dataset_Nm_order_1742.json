    "Content": "Given a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m $ which is smooth, show that\n$$\\operatorname{graph}(f) = \\{(x,f(x)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+m} : x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\}$$\nis a smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$. I'm honestly completely unsure of where or how to begin this problem. I am interested in definitions and perhaps hints that can lead me in the right direction.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is an application of the Implicit Function Theorem . You have a function $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ and you construct the graph given by: $\\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^m : y = f(x) \\}.$ Let me define a new map, say, $G : \\mathbb{R}^{n+m} \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ given by $G : (x,y) \\mapsto y-f(x).$ I have defined this the way I have so that the graph of $f$ is the zero-level set of $G$, i.e. the graph of $f$ is the set of $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $G(x,y) = 0.$ In brutal detail this map is really: $$G : (x_1,\\ldots,x_n,y_1,\\ldots,y_m) \\mapsto (y_1-f_1(x_1,\\ldots,x_n),\\ldots,y_m-f_m(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)) \\, .$$ We need to calculate the Jacobian Matrix of $G$. A quick calculation will show you that: $$ J_G = \\left[\\begin{array}{c|c} -J_f & I_m \\end{array}\\right] ,$$ where $J_f$ is the $m \\times n$ Jacobian matrix of $f$ and $I_m$ is the $m \\times m$ identity matrix. The matrix $J_G$ is an $m \\times (m+n)$ matrix. To be able to apply the IFT , we need to show that $0$ is a regular value of $G$. (After all, the graph of $f$ is $G^{-1}(0).$) We can do this by showing that none of the critical points get sent to 0 by $G$. Notice that $G$ has no critical points because $J_G$ always has maximal rank, i.e. $m$. This is clearly true since the identity matrix $I_m$ has rank $m$. It follows that the graph of $f$ is a smooth, parametrisable $(n+m)-m=n$ dimensional manifold in a neighbourhood of each of its points.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is about showing that the graph of a smooth function f: ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ is a smooth submanifold of ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ. Hmm, I remember that submanifolds are subsets of a manifold that themselves look like Euclidean space locally. Since we're dealing with ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ, which is a manifold itself, the graph should inherit some smooth structure.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions. A smooth submanifold of dimension k in ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ is a subset S such that for every point p in S, there exists a neighborhood U around p in ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ and a smooth diffeomorphism φ: U → V (where V is open in ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ) such that φ(U ∩ S) = V ∩ (ℝᵏ × {0}ⁿ⁺ᵐ⁻ᵏ}). Alternatively, sometimes we use the regular level set theorem or the implicit function theorem, but maybe here it's easier to use the graph as a parametrization.\n\nWait, another approach: if we can show that the graph is locally the image of a smooth embedding, then it would be a submanifold. Since the function f is smooth, the map x ↦ (x, f(x)) should be a smooth embedding from ℝⁿ into ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ. Let me check that. An embedding requires that the map is an immersion (derivative injective) and a homeomorphism onto its image.\n\nThe derivative of the map x ↦ (x, f(x)) would have Jacobian matrix [I; Df], where I is the n×n identity matrix and Df is the m×n derivative matrix of f. Since the Jacobian has full rank n (because the identity part is full rank), this map is indeed an immersion. Also, it's injective and a homeomorphism because the projection onto the first factor is continuous and the inverse is just the restriction of that projection. Therefore, the graph is an embedded submanifold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the regular value theorem. If we consider the graph as the set of points (x, y) in ℝⁿ⁺�m such that y = f(x). So define a function F(x, y) = y - f(x). Then the graph is the zero set of F. To apply the regular value theorem, we need to check that 0 is a regular value, meaning that the derivative DF is surjective at every point on the graph. Let's compute DF. The derivative would be [-Df | I_m], where I_m is the m×m identity matrix. So for any point (x, f(x)), the derivative DF(x, f(x)) is a matrix with the first n columns being -Df(x) and the last m columns being I_m. The rank of this matrix is m, since the last m columns form an identity matrix, which are linearly independent. Therefore, the derivative is surjective, so 0 is a regular value, and hence the graph is a smooth submanifold of dimension n.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"show it's a smooth submanifold\", but maybe they don't specify the dimension. Either way, both approaches should work. The first approach using the embedding seems straightforward. Since f is smooth, the graph is the image of a smooth embedding, hence an embedded submanifold. The second approach using the regular value theorem also shows that it's a submanifold of dimension n (since the codimension is m, so dimension is n + m - m = n).\n\nBut the problem might be expecting the user to construct charts or use the definition directly. Maybe another way is to define local coordinates around each point on the graph. Let’s take a point (x₀, f(x₀)) in the graph. Consider an open neighborhood around this point in ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ. We can use the projection onto the first n coordinates as a chart. Let U be an open set in ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ containing (x₀, f(x₀)), and define a coordinate map φ: U → ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ by φ(x, y) = (x, y - f(x)). Then the inverse of φ would be (x, z) ↦ (x, z + f(x)). Since f is smooth, φ is a diffeomorphism. The image of the graph under φ would be the set {(x, 0) | x ∈ ℝⁿ} ∩ φ(U), which is a slice of ℝⁿ⁺ᵐ. Hence, this shows that the graph is a submanifold.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there are multiple approaches: using the embedding, the regular value theorem, or constructing local charts. The key assumptions here are that f is smooth, which allows the use of derivatives and ensures that the maps involved are diffeomorphisms. The problem doesn't mention any additional constraints, so the main assumption is the smoothness of f. The problem is to show that under this condition, the graph is a smooth submanifold.",
