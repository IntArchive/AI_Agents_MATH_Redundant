    "Content": "In this question , the result $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\log\\cos^2x}{1+e^{2x}}\\,dx=-\\frac{\\log^22}2$$ was shown by writing $\\log\\cos^2x=2\\log\\cos x$ . The OP of the linked question attempted the integral as follows $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\log\\cos^2x}{1+e^{2x}}\\,dx=\\frac12\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\log(1+\\cos x)}{1+e^x}\\,dx-\\frac{\\log^22}2$$ by writing $\\log\\cos^2x=\\log(1+\\cos2x)-\\log2$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that the integrand is absolutely integrable on $(0,\\infty)$ ; this claim will let us do things like swap sums and integrals, and break up the region of integration. Start by writing part of the integrand using a geometric series: \\begin{align}\nI=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\log(1+\\cos(x))}{1+e^x}\\,dx &= \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log(1+\\cos(x))\\cdot  \\frac{1}{1-(-e^{-x})}\\cdot e^{-x}\\,dx\\\\&=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\int _0^{\\infty} \\log(1+\\cos(x)) e^{-nx}\\,dx\\end{align} Split up $(0,\\infty)$ into blocks of length $2\\pi$ : $$\nI=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty}\\int _{2\\pi m}^{2\\pi(m+1)} \\log(1+\\cos(x)) e^{-nx}\\,dx\n$$ Change of variable to standardize the new region of integration to $(0,2\\pi)$ : $$\nI=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty}e^{-2mn\\pi}\\int _{0}^{2\\pi} \\log(1+\\cos(x)) e^{-nx}\\,dx\n$$ This middle sum is a geometric series: $$\nI=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\coth\n(\\pi n)\\right) \\cdot \\int _{0}^{2\\pi} \\log(1+\\cos(x)) e^{-nx}\\,dx\n$$ Invoke the Fourier series for the log term on $(0,2\\pi)$ ; this is the same as the Fourier series for $\\log(1-\\cos(x))$ on $(-\\pi,\\pi)$ , if you'd prefer: \\begin{align}I&=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\coth\n(\\pi n)\\right) \\cdot \\int _{0}^{2\\pi}\\left(-\\log(2)+ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{2\\cos(k x)(-1)^{k+1}}{k}\\right) e^{-nx}\\,dx\n\\\\&=\\small\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\coth\n(\\pi n)\\right) \\cdot\\left( \\int _{0}^{2\\pi}-\\log(2)e^{-nx}\\,dx+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2(-1)^{k+1}}{k} \\int _{0}^{2\\pi}\\cos(k x)e^{-nx}\\,dx\\right)\\end{align} These new integrals are easily evaluated either directly or by integration by parts twice, and in fact cancel with the term from the middle sum: \\begin{align}\nI&=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n+1}\\left( \\frac{-\\log(2)}{n} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{2(-1)^{k+1}}{k}\\cdot\\frac{n}{n^2+k^2}\\right)\n\\\\&=\\log(2)\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}  + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{2(-1)^{k+n}}{k}\\cdot\\frac{n}{n^2+k^2}\n\\end{align} But the second sum can now be evaluated using the symmetry trick from the linked question and the value of the alternating harmonic series: \\begin{align}\nI&=\\log(2)\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}  + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{k+n}}{nk}\n\\\\&=\\log(2)\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}  - \\log(2)\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}\\\\&=0\n\\end{align} Some remarks. My first thought was to use $\\int_{-a}^a f(x)/(1+e^x)\\,dx = \\int_0^a f(x)\\,dx$ if $f$ is even and integrable, but the shoe's on the wrong foot, so to speak. I also tried the residue theorem and some other substitutions but they didn't pan out. It was interesting to note the prevalence of $\\log(2)^2$ throughout this problem; I tried (in vain!) to connect the integrals in this problem with Putnam 2017 B4 , though perhaps there is a link. As mentioned in my comment, much of this follows from your linked question. Hope this is clear and helpful.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of log(1 + cos x) divided by (1 + e^x) dx equals zero, without using the indirect method of expressing log(cos^2 x) in two different ways. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the integral itself. The integrand is log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x). The limits are from 0 to infinity. The challenge here is to evaluate this integral directly. The user mentions that previously, this result was obtained by manipulating another integral involving log(cos^2 x), but now they want a direct approach.\n\nSo, how can I approach this? Let's recall some techniques for evaluating integrals involving exponentials and logarithmic terms. Maybe substitution or symmetry? Let me consider substitution first. The denominator is 1 + e^x, which often suggests substitution like t = e^x, which would make dt = e^x dx, but I need to see if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe splitting the integral into two parts. Since the limits are from 0 to infinity, perhaps exploiting the behavior of the integrand as x approaches 0 and infinity. Let's check the behavior at the limits. As x approaches infinity, e^x becomes very large, so the denominator 1 + e^x ~ e^x, so the integrand behaves like log(1 + cos x)/e^x. Now, log(1 + cos x) for large x. But cos x oscillates between -1 and 1, but here x is real going to infinity. Wait, actually, when x is real and approaches infinity, cos x oscillates between -1 and 1 periodically. However, here x is going to infinity over the real line, not in the complex plane. But since the integral is over real x from 0 to infinity, the integrand's numerator log(1 + cos x) is problematic because when cos x = -1, which happens at x = π, 3π, 5π, etc., log(1 + cos x) becomes log(0), which is negative infinity. But wait, the original integral as stated in the problem is log(1 + cos x). But 1 + cos x ranges from 0 to 2 because cos x ranges between -1 and 1. Therefore, log(1 + cos x) is log of something between 0 and 2. So at points where cos x = -1, the log goes to negative infinity. Therefore, the integrand has singularities at x = (2k+1)π for integers k ≥ 0. But the original problem says the integral is equal to zero. How is this possible? Because integrating across points where the integrand goes to negative infinity? That suggests that the integral might be improper not only at infinity but also at those singular points. However, maybe there's a cancellation or some symmetry that causes the integral to be zero despite those singularities. Wait, but in the original problem statement, when they split the integral into parts, they might have considered principal values or some regularization. Hmm, this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral is convergent despite those singularities? Let me check the integrability. Near x = (2k+1)π, 1 + cos x ~ (x - (2k+1)π)^2/2 (using the Taylor expansion of cos x around those points). Therefore, log(1 + cos x) ~ log( (x - (2k+1)π)^2 / 2 ) = 2 log|x - (2k+1)π| - log 2. So near each singularity, the integrand behaves like 2 log|x - (2k+1)π| divided by 1 + e^x. Since log|x - a| is integrable around x = a (because the integral of log|x - a| dx converges around a), and the denominator 1 + e^x is bounded away from zero (since at x = (2k+1)π, e^x is large for large k, but near x = π, e^x is e^π ~ 23, so the denominator is ~23 there). Therefore, each singularity is integrable. So the integral is convergent.\n\nBut how to compute it? Since the integral is from 0 to infinity, maybe using substitution to exploit symmetry. Let me try substituting x = -t or something, but since x is from 0 to infinity, maybe another substitution. Alternatively, maybe consider splitting the integral into intervals of π, like from 0 to π, π to 2π, etc., and see if there's a telescoping or cancellation.\n\nAlternatively, since the denominator is 1 + e^x, which resembles Fermi-Dirac distribution, and sometimes integrals involving 1/(1 + e^x) can be related to their complements, like 1/(1 + e^{-x}) via substitution. Let me try substitution u = -x. Wait, but integrating from 0 to infinity, substituting x = -u would map it to -integral from 0 to -infinity, which is not helpful. Alternatively, substitution t = x - π? Let's see. Let me try substitution x = t + π. Then when x goes from 0 to infinity, t goes from -π to infinity. But this might complicate the limits. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 1/(1 + e^x) = 1 - 1/(1 + e^{-x}). Maybe split the integral into two parts: integral from 0 to infinity of log(1 + cos x) dx minus integral from 0 to infinity of log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^{-x}) dx. But not sure if this helps.\n\nWait, another idea: use the substitution x = -y. Let me try that. Let I be the original integral:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x)] dx.\n\nLet’s substitute x = -y. Then when x approaches 0, y approaches 0 from the negative side, and when x approaches infinity, y approaches -infinity. But this substitution might not be helpful because the limits become from 0 to -∞. However, perhaps if we extend the integral to the entire real line. Let's see:\n\nBut the original integral is only from 0 to ∞. Maybe consider extending it to -∞ to ∞ by symmetry. But log(1 + cos x) is even function because cos(-x) = cos x. So log(1 + cos x) is even. However, 1/(1 + e^x) is not even. If x is replaced by -x, the denominator becomes 1 + e^{-x}. So perhaps writing the integral as:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x)] dx.\n\nIf we consider also the integral from -∞ to 0, substituting x = -y:\n\n∫_{-∞}^0 [log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x)] dx = ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + cos y)/(1 + e^{-y})] dy.\n\nSo the sum of the two integrals would be:\n\n∫_{-∞}^∞ [log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x)] dx = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x) [1/(1 + e^x) + 1/(1 + e^{-x})] dx.\n\nBut 1/(1 + e^x) + 1/(1 + e^{-x}) = [1/(1 + e^x)] + [e^x/(1 + e^x)] = 1. Therefore, the integral over the entire real line would be ∫_{-∞}^∞ log(1 + cos x) dx. But this integral is divergent because log(1 + cos x) is periodic with period 2π, and over each period, the integral is a fixed negative number (since log(1 + cos x) is non-positive and integrable over a period). Therefore, integrating this over the entire real line would give negative infinity. But in our case, the original integral I is equal to half of this divergent integral? Wait, but this approach seems flawed.\n\nWait, maybe this suggests that the original integral I can be related to another integral, but since the sum is divergent, perhaps this approach is not helpful. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother idea: use Fourier series or expansion of log(1 + cos x). Remember that log(1 + cos x) can be expressed using a series. Let's recall that 1 + cos x = 2 cos²(x/2), so log(1 + cos x) = log 2 + 2 log cos(x/2). But log cos(x/2) can be expressed as a Fourier series. Wait, there's a known Fourier series for log cos x:\n\nlog cos x = -log 2 - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n (cos 2n x)/n, valid for |x| < π/2. But our integral is over x from 0 to ∞, which includes regions beyond π/2. So maybe this expansion isn't directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the series expansion for log(1 + cos x). Let me recall that log(1 + cos x) = log(2 cos²(x/2)) = log 2 + 2 log |cos(x/2)|. But again, log |cos(x/2)| has singularities at x = (2k+1)π, similar to before.\n\nAlternatively, use the Taylor series expansion for log(1 + y) where y = cos x. But cos x is oscillatory, so the series would be log(1 + cos x) = log 2 + log(1 + (cos x)/2 - 1/2) ??? Wait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating by parts. Let’s set u = log(1 + cos x) and dv = dx/(1 + e^x). Then du = (-sin x)/(1 + cos x) dx, and v = -ln(1 + e^{-x}) ??? Wait, integrating dv = dx/(1 + e^x). Let me check:\n\nThe integral of 1/(1 + e^x) dx is x - ln(1 + e^x) + C. So maybe v = x - ln(1 + e^x). But integrating by parts:\n\nI = uv | from 0 to ∞ - ∫₀^∞ v du.\n\nBut uv at ∞: log(1 + cos x) tends to log(1 + cos ∞), but cos x oscillates, so this term oscillates. Similarly, x - ln(1 + e^x) as x approaches infinity behaves like x - (x + ln(1 + e^{-x})) ~ -ln(1 + 0) = 0. Wait, let me check:\n\nv = ∫ dx/(1 + e^x) = -ln(1 + e^{-x}) + C. So integrating from 0 to x, v(x) = -ln(1 + e^{-x}) + ln 2. Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, the antiderivative is x - ln(1 + e^x) + C. At x = ∞, x - ln(1 + e^x) = x - (x + ln(1 + e^{-x})) ~ -ln(1 + 0) = 0. At x = 0, it's 0 - ln(2). So uv from 0 to ∞ would be [0 * 0] - [log(2) * (-ln 2)]? Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe integration by parts is not the right approach here.\n\nAnother idea: use the substitution t = e^x. Let’s try that. Let t = e^x, so when x = 0, t = 1, and when x = ∞, t = ∞. Then dx = dt/t. The integral becomes:\n\nI = ∫₁^∞ [log(1 + cos(ln t)) / (1 + t)] * (dt/t).\n\nHmm, this seems more complicated because we have cos(ln t), which is oscillatory but with logarithmically increasing frequency. Not sure if helpful.\n\nWait, maybe consider the integral from 0 to ∞ of log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx. Let me split the integral into two parts: from 0 to π, and from π to ∞. For the second part, substitute x = y + π. Then when x = π, y = 0, and as x approaches ∞, y approaches ∞. So:\n\n∫₀^∞ [log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x)] dx = ∫₀^π [log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x)] dx + ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + cos(y + π))/(1 + e^{y + π})] dy.\n\nBut cos(y + π) = -cos y, so log(1 + cos(y + π)) = log(1 - cos y). So the second integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [log(1 - cos y)/(1 + e^{y} e^{π})] dy.\n\nBut e^{π} is a constant, so this is:\n\n∫₀^∞ [log(1 - cos y)/(1 + e^{y + π})] dy.\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. However, notice that 1 - cos y = 2 sin²(y/2), so log(1 - cos y) = log 2 + 2 log |sin(y/2)|. Similarly, log(1 + cos x) = log 2 + 2 log |cos(x/2)|. Maybe these expressions can be useful.\n\nAlternatively, notice that log(1 + cos x) + log(1 - cos x) = log(1 - cos²x) = log(sin²x) = 2 log |sin x|. So maybe combining the original integral and the transformed one. Let me see:\n\nLet I = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx.\n\nAfter substitution, we have:\n\nI = ∫₀^π log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx + ∫₀^∞ log(1 - cos y)/(1 + e^{y + π}) dy.\n\nBut if we consider adding I and some multiple of another integral, perhaps we can find a relation. However, this might not directly lead to the result.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the integral over one period, say from 0 to 2π, and see if there's cancellation. Let’s write I as the sum over integrals from 2πk to 2π(k+1). But integrating over each interval might have a pattern. However, the denominator 1 + e^x changes with each interval, making it non-periodic. So this approach might not work.\n\nAnother idea: expand log(1 + cos x) as a Fourier series and integrate term by term. Let’s try that. As mentioned earlier, log(1 + cos x) = log(2 cos²(x/2)) = log 2 + 2 log |cos(x/2)|. The Fourier series for log |cos(x/2)| is known. Let me recall that:\n\nlog |cos(x/2)| = -log 2 - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n (cos nx)/n, for |x| < π.\n\nBut our integral is over x from 0 to ∞, which includes x beyond π. However, perhaps we can express log |cos(x/2)| as a Fourier series in terms of cosines with arguments modulated by the periodicity. Wait, but if |x| < π, the series converges, but beyond that, the series would diverge or not represent the function. So this might not be valid for all x in [0, ∞). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use the expansion for log(1 + cos x) = log 2 + 2 log |cos(x/2)| and then use the Fourier series for log |cos(x/2)| in the interval where it's valid, and see if the integral can be expressed as a sum. But given that the integral is over an infinite interval, this might lead to an infinite sum which is difficult to evaluate.\n\nAlternatively, consider contour integration. The presence of 1/(1 + e^x) suggests that the integrand might be related to Fermi-Dirac integrals, and sometimes such integrals can be evaluated using residues in complex analysis. Let me explore this possibility.\n\nThe integral is ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + cos x)]/(1 + e^x) dx. To use contour integration, we need to relate this to a complex integral. Note that 1/(1 + e^x) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution, which can be represented as a contour integral, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider extending x to the complex plane. However, log(1 + cos x) has branch points wherever 1 + cos x = 0, which occurs at x = (2k + 1)π. So the integrand has singularities along the real axis at these points, which complicates contour integration.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating over a rectangular contour in the complex plane, avoiding the poles and branch cuts. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, use the identity that 1/(1 + e^x) = 1 - 1/(1 + e^{-x}), so the integral becomes:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x) dx - ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + cos x)]/(1 + e^{-x}) dx.\n\nBut the first integral ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x) dx is divergent, as discussed earlier, so this splitting might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps the key lies in the fact that when you perform the substitution x → x + iπ, or some other shift in the complex plane, but I need to be cautious with branch cuts and singularities.\n\nAlternatively, consider pairing terms in the integral. For example, note that the integrand might have some symmetry when x is replaced by x + iπ, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: consider that 1/(1 + e^x) = ∫₀^1 e^{-x t} dt, but not exactly. Wait, actually, 1/(1 + e^x) can be expressed as a sum from n=1 to ∞ of (-1)^{n+1} e^{-n x} for x > 0. Wait, that's the expansion 1/(1 + e^x) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} e^{-n x} for x > 0. This is valid because for x > 0, |e^{-x}| < 1, so it's a geometric series. Let me verify:\n\n1/(1 + e^x) = e^{-x}/(1 + e^{-x}) = e^{-x} Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n e^{-n x} = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n e^{-(n+1)x} = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n-1} e^{-n x} = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} e^{-n x}. Yes, that's correct. So we can write:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x) Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} e^{-n x} dx.\n\nInterchange the sum and integral (if justified by dominated convergence theorem), then:\n\nI = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x) e^{-n x} dx.\n\nSo if we can compute the integrals ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x) e^{-n x} dx for each n, then we can sum them up. Let's denote J(n) = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x) e^{-n x} dx. If we can find a closed-form expression for J(n), then we can evaluate the sum.\n\nTo compute J(n), note that log(1 + cos x) = log(2 cos²(x/2)) = log 2 + 2 log cos(x/2). So:\n\nJ(n) = ∫₀^∞ [log 2 + 2 log cos(x/2)] e^{-n x} dx = log 2 ∫₀^∞ e^{-n x} dx + 2 ∫₀^∞ log cos(x/2) e^{-n x} dx.\n\nThe first integral is log 2 / n. The second integral is 2 ∫₀^∞ log cos(x/2) e^{-n x} dx. Let’s substitute t = x/2, so x = 2t, dx = 2dt. Then:\n\n2 ∫₀^∞ log cos t e^{-2n t} 2 dt = 4 ∫₀^∞ log cos t e^{-2n t} dt.\n\nSo J(n) = log 2 / n + 4 ∫₀^∞ log cos t e^{-2n t} dt.\n\nNow, the integral ∫₀^∞ log cos t e^{-2n t} dt might be known. Let me recall that there is a standard integral involving log cos t. For example, from integral tables, we know that ∫₀^∞ log cos t e^{-pt} dt can be expressed in terms of digamma functions or similar. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, expand log cos t into its Fourier series and integrate term by term. As before, log cos t = -log 2 - Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k (cos 2kt)/k, valid for |t| < π/2. But our integral is over t from 0 to ∞, which includes t > π/2. However, perhaps if we use this expansion and integrate term by term, even though it's only valid for |t| < π/2, maybe the resulting series will still converge.\n\nAssuming we can use the expansion:\n\nlog cos t = -log 2 - Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k (cos 2kt)/k.\n\nThen,\n\n∫₀^∞ log cos t e^{-2n t} dt = -log 2 ∫₀^∞ e^{-2n t} dt - Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k/k ∫₀^∞ cos 2kt e^{-2n t} dt.\n\nCompute each integral:\n\nFirst integral: -log 2 ∫₀^∞ e^{-2n t} dt = -log 2 / (2n).\n\nSecond integral: - Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k/k ∫₀^∞ cos 2kt e^{-2n t} dt.\n\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ cos 2kt e^{-2n t} dt is the Laplace transform of cos 2kt at s = 2n, which is (2n)/( (2n)^2 + (2k)^2 ) = (2n)/(4n² + 4k²) = n/(2(n² + k²)).\n\nSo the second integral becomes:\n\n- Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k/k * n/(2(n² + k²)) ) = - (n/2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)].\n\nTherefore, combining everything:\n\nJ(n) = log 2 / n + 4 [ -log 2 / (2n) - (n/2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)] ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nJ(n) = log 2 / n - 4 * log 2 / (2n) - 4 * (n/2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)]\n\n= log 2 / n - 2 log 2 / n - 2n Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)]\n\n= - log 2 / n - 2n Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)]\n\nSo J(n) = - log 2 / n - 2n Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)]\n\nTherefore, the original integral I is:\n\nI = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} J(n) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} [ - log 2 / n - 2n Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)] ]\n\n= Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} (- log 2 / n) + Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} (-2n) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)]\n\n= log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} (-1/n) + (-2) Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} n Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)]\n\nSimplify the first sum:\n\nlog 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} (-1/n) = log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} (-1/n) = log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} (-1/n) = log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n)(-1)^{n+1} (-1) = log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n)(-1)^{n+2} = log 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n)(-1)^n.\n\nBut Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n /n = -ln 2. Therefore, the first term becomes log 2 * (-ln 2).\n\nThe second sum is:\n\n-2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} n Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / [k(n² + k²)]\n\n= -2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} (-1)^k n / [k(n² + k²)]\n\n= -2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{n + k +1} n / [k(n² + k²)]\n\nThis double sum looks complicated. Maybe interchange the order of summation:\n\n= -2 Σ_{k=1}^∞ Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n + k +1} n / [k(n² + k²)]\n\n= -2 Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k +1} /k Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n n / (n² + k²)\n\nLet’s focus on the inner sum Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n n / (n² + k²). This sum can be evaluated using known series. Let me recall that Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n n / (n² + a²) can be expressed using hyperbolic functions. \n\nThere's a standard sum: Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n n / (n² + a²) = (π / (2 sinh πa)) - 1/(2a²) ) ? Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, I think there's a formula involving the digamma function. Let me use partial fractions or contour integration. Alternatively, note that:\n\nΣ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n n / (n² + k²) = (1/2) Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n [1/(n + ik) + 1/(n - ik)]\n\nBut this might not help directly. Alternatively, consider the Fourier series or Poisson summation formula. Alternatively, recall that:\n\nΣ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n / (n + a) = - (ψ( (a +1)/2 ) - ψ( a/2 )) / 2, where ψ is the digamma function. But differentiating with respect to a might give the sum involving n/(n² + k²). However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity that Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n n / (n² + k²) = - (π / (2 sinh πk)) ). Let me check for specific k. Take k =1:\n\nΣ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n n / (n² +1). Numerically, compute this sum. Let's compute terms:\n\nn=1: (-1)^1 *1/(1+1) = -1/2\n\nn=2: (-1)^2 *2/(4+1)= 2/5\n\nn=3: (-1)^3 *3/(9+1)= -3/10\n\nn=4: 4/17 ≈ 0.235\n\nn=5: -5/26 ≈ -0.192\n\nSumming these: -0.5 + 0.4 = -0.1; -0.1 -0.3 = -0.4; -0.4 +0.235 ≈ -0.165; -0.165 -0.192 ≈ -0.357. Continuing, the terms alternate and decrease in magnitude, approaching a limit. Actual value might be around -0.36, but let's compare with -π/(2 sinh π) ≈ -π/(2*11.5487) ≈ -0.137. Not matching. So perhaps the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a relation using contour integration. Consider the function f(z) = (-1)^z z / (z² + k²). Integrate around a contour enclosing the poles at z = ±ik. But (-1)^z = e^{iπ z}, which is meromorphic. The integral over a large contour tending to zero, and the sum over residues gives the sum. But this is getting too involved.\n\nGiven the complexity of this approach, maybe this is not the right path. Let's think of another way.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem. The user wants a direct proof that the integral equals zero. Given that in the indirect method they arrived at this by equating two expressions, perhaps there's a symmetry or substitution that directly shows the integral is zero.\n\nLet me try substitution x = -y again. Wait, the original integral is from 0 to ∞. If I substitute x = -y, the limits become from 0 to -∞, which is not useful. But perhaps consider extending the integral to the entire real line by symmetry. However, the integrand is not even. The denominator 1 + e^x is not symmetric. But maybe if I add the integral with x replaced by -x.\n\nLet’s define I = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx.\n\nConsider the integral from -∞ to ∞, but split into two parts:\n\nI_total = ∫_{-∞}^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx + ∫_{-∞}^0 log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx.\n\nIn the second integral, substitute x = -y:\n\n∫_{-∞}^0 log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos y)/(1 + e^{-y}) dy.\n\nTherefore, I_total = I + ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos y)/(1 + e^{-y}) dy.\n\nBut 1/(1 + e^{-y}) = 1 - 1/(1 + e^{y}). Therefore,\n\nI_total = I + ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos y) dy - ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos y)/(1 + e^{y}) dy.\n\nNotice that the last term is just I. So,\n\nI_total = I + ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos y) dy - I = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos y) dy.\n\nBut this implies that I_total = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos y) dy, which is divergent. This approach doesn't help directly.\n\nAnother idea: consider pairing each term x with x + iπ in the complex plane. Let’s consider the function f(z) = log(1 + cos z)/(1 + e^z). Integrate f(z) over a rectangular contour with vertices at 0, R, R + iπ, iπ, and back to 0. Let's see if the integrals over the vertical sides vanish as R → ∞. If so, then the integral over the contour would be 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. But need to check if there are any poles or branch cuts inside the contour.\n\nThe function 1 + e^z has poles where e^z = -1, which occurs at z = i(2k +1)π for integers k. Inside the contour (from 0 to R to R + iπ to iπ to 0), the poles are at z = iπ. So residue at z = iπ:\n\nRes_{z=iπ} f(z) = lim_{z→iπ} (z - iπ) log(1 + cos z)/(1 + e^z).\n\nBut 1 + e^z has a simple pole at z = iπ, since derivative of 1 + e^z is e^z, which at z = iπ is -1. So the residue is log(1 + cos(iπ)) / (-1).\n\nCompute cos(iπ) = cosh(π). Therefore, log(1 + cosh(π)). So the residue is - log(1 + cosh(π)).\n\nBut also, log(1 + cos z) has branch points where 1 + cos z = 0, which is at z = (2k +1)π, so in the contour, there's a branch point at z = π. But our contour is up to z = iπ, which is different. Wait, cos(z) at z = iπ is cosh(π), which is a positive real number greater than 1, so 1 + cos(z) is 1 + cosh(π) > 0, so no branch points on the contour except at z = iπ, but the residue calculation seems valid.\n\nAssuming the integrals over the vertical segments vanish as R → ∞, then:\n\n∫₀^R f(z) dz + ∫_R^{R + iπ} f(z) dz + ∫_{R + iπ}^{iπ} f(z) dz + ∫_{iπ}^0 f(z) dz = 2πi * (-log(1 + cosh(π))).\n\nAs R → ∞, the integrals over the vertical segments (from R to R + iπ and from iπ to 0) need to vanish. Let’s check the integral from R to R + iπ:\n\n|∫_R^{R + iπ} f(z) dz| ≤ π * max_{z=R+iy, 0≤y≤π} |log(1 + cos z)| / |1 + e^z|.\n\nAs R → ∞, |1 + e^z| ≈ e^R, and |log(1 + cos z)|. Let’s write z = R + iy. Then cos z = cos(R + iy) = cos R cosh y - i sin R sinh y. The magnitude |cos z| = sqrt( cos² R cosh² y + sin² R sinh² y ). As R → ∞, cos R and sin R oscillate, but cosh y ≥ 1 and sinh y ≥ 0 for y ∈ [0, π]. Therefore, |cos z| grows like cosh y for large R, but since R is real and large, cos R and sin R oscillate between -1 and 1. Therefore, |1 + cos z| ≤ 1 + |cos z| ≤ 1 + cosh y + 1 = O(cosh y). But cosh y is bounded for y ∈ [0, π], since cosh π is a constant. Therefore, |log(1 + cos z)| ≤ log(1 + cosh π + 1) = constant. Therefore, the integrand is bounded by O(1)/e^R, which tends to zero as R → ∞. Therefore, the integral over the vertical segment vanishes as R → ∞.\n\nSimilarly, the integral from iπ to 0 is along the imaginary axis. Wait, but we need to check the integral from iπ back to 0. That is, parametrize z = iy for y from π to 0:\n\n∫_{iπ}^0 f(z) dz = -i ∫₀^π f(iy) dy.\n\nSo f(iy) = log(1 + cos(iy))/(1 + e^{iy}) = log(1 + cosh y)/(1 + e^{iy}).\n\nBut e^{iy} is on the unit circle, so |1 + e^{iy}| ≥ |1 - |e^{iy}|| = 0 when y = π, but y ranges from 0 to π. However, this integral is multiplied by -i, and contributes to the contour integral.\n\nPutting it all together, the contour integral gives:\n\n∫₀^∞ f(x) dx + ∫_{∞}^{∞ + iπ} f(z) dz + ∫_{∞ + iπ}^{iπ} f(z) dz + ∫_{iπ}^0 f(z) dz = 2πi * Res.\n\nBut the integrals over the vertical segments vanish, so we have:\n\n∫₀^∞ f(x) dx + ∫_{iπ}^0 f(z) dz = 2πi * (-log(1 + cosh(π))).\n\nBut ∫_{iπ}^0 f(z) dz = -i ∫₀^π log(1 + cosh y)/(1 + e^{iy}) dy.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps take the real part or something. Alternatively, consider that the integral over the contour should also be related to the integral from 0 to ∞ of f(z) plus the integral from 0 to ∞ of f(z + iπ) times iπ. Wait, perhaps another substitution.\n\nLet’s compute the integral from iπ to R + iπ of f(z) dz. Substitute z = x + iπ:\n\n∫_{iπ}^{R + iπ} f(z) dz = ∫₀^R f(x + iπ) dx.\n\nCompute f(x + iπ) = log(1 + cos(x + iπ))/(1 + e^{x + iπ}).\n\nBut cos(x + iπ) = cos x cos iπ - sin x sin iπ = cos x cosh π - i sin x sinh π.\n\nAnd e^{x + iπ} = e^x e^{iπ} = -e^x.\n\nTherefore, f(x + iπ) = log(1 + cos x cosh π - i sin x sinh π)/(1 - e^x).\n\nBut this expression is complex, and the denominator 1 - e^x is negative for x > 0. This seems messy. However, if we assume that the integral over the top horizontal segment (from R + iπ to iπ) relates to some transformation of the original integral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the integrals from 0 to ∞ and from iπ to ∞ + iπ relates to the residue. But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and lack of progress, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's go back to the original substitution made in the problem's linked question. They wrote log cos^2x as log(1 + cos 2x) - log 2. Maybe there's a way to use that identity directly without going through the original problem. Let's see:\n\nWe have to prove ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx = 0.\n\nLet me consider substituting x = 2y. Then dx = 2 dy, and the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos 2y)/(1 + e^{2y}) dy.\n\nBut log(1 + cos 2y) = log(2 cos²y) = log 2 + 2 log cos y. So:\n\n2 ∫₀^∞ [log 2 + 2 log cos y]/(1 + e^{2y}) dy = 2 log 2 ∫₀^∞ 1/(1 + e^{2y}) dy + 4 ∫₀^∞ log cos y/(1 + e^{2y}) dy.\n\nCompute the first integral: ∫₀^∞ 1/(1 + e^{2y}) dy = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ 1/(1 + e^{t}) dt (substituting t = 2y) = (1/2) [ln(e^t/(1 + e^t))] from 0 to ∞ = (1/2) [0 - (-ln 2)] = ln 2 / 2.\n\nSo the first term becomes 2 log 2 * (ln 2 / 2) = (log 2)^2.\n\nThe second term is 4 ∫₀^∞ log cos y/(1 + e^{2y}) dy. Let’s denote this integral as K. So the transformed integral is (log 2)^2 + 4K.\n\nBut the original transformed integral is also equal to 2 ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos 2y)/(1 + e^{2y}) dy, which is related to the original problem. Wait, but the user wants to evaluate ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx = 0. If I can relate this to K somehow.\n\nAlternatively, note that the integral we are trying to compute is I = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx.\n\nFrom the previous substitution, we have:\n\nI = ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx.\n\nBut in the linked question, they related this integral to another one involving log cos^2x. Let me see:\n\nIn the linked question, they wrote log cos^2x = log(1 + cos 2x) - log 2, which leads to:\n\n∫₀^∞ log cos^2x/(1 + e^{2x}) dx = ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + cos 2x) - log 2]/(1 + e^{2x}) dx.\n\nLet’s substitute 2x = t, so x = t/2, dx = dt/2. Then the integral becomes:\n\n(1/2) ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + cos t) - log 2]/(1 + e^t) dt = (1/2)[ ∫₀^∞ log(1 + cos t)/(1 + e^t) dt - log 2 ∫₀^∞ 1/(1 + e^t) dt ].\n\nThe first term is (1/2)I, and the second term is (1/2)(-log 2)(ln 2). So:\n\n∫₀^∞ log cos^2x/(1 + e^{2x}) dx = (1/2)I - (log 2)^2 / 2.\n\nBut from the linked question, this integral was computed as - (log 2)^2 / 2. Therefore,\n\n(1/2)I - (log 2)^2 / 2 = - (log 2)^2 / 2 => (1/2)I = 0 => I = 0.\n\nBut this is exactly the indirect method the user mentioned, which they want to avoid. They want a direct proof. Therefore, this approach isn't suitable.\n\nPerhaps another idea: since the integral equals zero, maybe the integrand is an odd function under some substitution. Let’s look for a substitution that flips the sign of the integral. Suppose there exists a substitution x → f(x) such that the integrand becomes its own negative. For example, if we find a substitution such that:\n\nlog(1 + cos f(x))/(1 + e^{f(x)}) * f'(x) = - log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x).\n\nThen, if such a substitution exists, the integral would satisfy I = -I, hence I = 0.\n\nLet’s try to find such a substitution. Let’s assume f(x) is such that:\n\nlog(1 + cos f(x))/(1 + e^{f(x)}) * f'(x) = - log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x).\n\nThis is a functional equation for f(x). Let’s see if we can find f(x) satisfying this.\n\nLet’s consider f(x) = x + c, but unlikely. Another idea: f(x) = π - x. Let’s try:\n\nLet’s set f(x) = π - x. Then f'(x) = -1. Compute the left-hand side:\n\nlog(1 + cos(π - x))/(1 + e^{π - x}) * (-1) = log(1 - cos x)/(1 + e^{π} e^{-x}) * (-1).\n\nThis equals - log(1 - cos x)/(1 + e^{π - x}) dx. We want this to equal - log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x).\n\nThus:\n\n- log(1 - cos x)/(1 + e^{π - x}) = - log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x)\n\nCancel the negatives:\n\nlog(1 - cos x)/(1 + e^{π - x}) = log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x)\n\nBut 1 - cos x = 2 sin²(x/2), and 1 + cos x = 2 cos²(x/2). So:\n\nlog(2 sin²(x/2))/(1 + e^{π - x}) = log(2 cos²(x/2))/(1 + e^x).\n\nThis would require:\n\n[log 2 + 2 log sin(x/2)]/(1 + e^{π - x}) = [log 2 + 2 log cos(x/2)]/(1 + e^x)\n\nThis is unlikely to hold for all x, but perhaps for specific x. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider f(x) such that e^{f(x)} = 1 + e^{π} e^{-x} or something, but this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution x = π - y, but then the limits would change. Let’s try:\n\nLet x = π - y. When x = 0, y = π. When x = π, y = 0. When x approaches infinity, y approaches -infinity. This complicates the limits, but perhaps:\n\nI = ∫₀^π log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx + ∫_π^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx.\n\nFor the first integral, substitute x = π - y (y from π to 0):\n\n∫₀^π log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx = ∫₀^π log(1 - cos y)/(1 + e^{π - y}) dy.\n\nSo the first integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^π log(1 - cos y)/(1 + e^{π - y}) dy.\n\nThe second integral is ∫_π^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx. Let’s substitute x = y + π in this integral:\n\n∫_π^∞ log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx = ∫₀^∞ log(1 - cos y)/(1 + e^{y + π}) dy.\n\nTherefore, the original integral I becomes:\n\nI = ∫₀^π log(1 - cos y)/(1 + e^{π - y}) dy + ∫₀^∞ log(1 - cos y)/(1 + e^{y + π}) dy.\n\nNow, note that the first integral is from 0 to π, and the second is from 0 to ∞. Let’s combine them:\n\nI = ∫₀^π log(1 - cos y) [1/(1 + e^{π - y}) + 1/(1 + e^{y + π})] dy + ∫_π^∞ log(1 - cos y)/(1 + e^{y + π}) dy.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, notice that in the interval y ∈ [0, π], the term 1/(1 + e^{π - y}) + 1/(1 + e^{y + π}) can be simplified:\n\n1/(1 + e^{π - y}) + 1/(1 + e^{y + π}) = [e^{y}/(e^{y} + e^{π})] + [1/(1 + e^{y + π})] = [e^{y} + 1]/[e^{y} + e^{π}] = (e^{y} + 1)/(e^{y} + e^{π}).\n\nThis doesn't simplify to 1, so this approach doesn't directly help.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find a substitution that directly shows the integral is zero, perhaps consider that the integrand is an odd function about some point, but I don't see it.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the function log(1 + cos x) is periodic with period 2π, and 1/(1 + e^x) decays exponentially. So the integral can be expressed as a sum over periods:\n\nI = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ∫_{2πk}^{2π(k+1)} log(1 + cos x)/(1 + e^x) dx.\n\nLet’s substitute x = 2πk + y in each integral:\n\nI = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ∫₀^{2π} log(1 + cos y)/(1 + e^{2πk + y}) dy.\n\nNow, factor out the decaying exponential term:\n\nI = ∫₀^{2π} log(1 + cos y) Σ_{k=0}^∞ e^{-2πk}/(1 + e^{y}) dy.\n\nWait, actually, 1/(1 + e^{2πk + y}) = e^{-2πk - y}/(1 + e^{-2πk - y}) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n e^{-(2πk + y)(n +1)} }.\n\nBut integrating this term by term might be possible. Alternatively, note that Σ_{k=0}^∞ 1/(1 + e^{2πk + y}) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 - 1/(1 + e^{-(2πk + y)})}.\n\nBut this is also complicated.\n\nAlternatively, approximate the sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ 1/(1 + e^{2πk + y}) as a geometric series. For large k, e^{2πk} is very large, so 1/(1 + e^{2πk + y}) ≈ e^{-2πk - y}. Therefore, the sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ e^{-2πk - y} = e^{-y}/(1 - e^{-2π}}). So the sum converges to approximately e^{-y}/(1 - e^{-2π}}), but this is an approximation. However, this suggests that the integral I is approximately proportional to ∫₀^{2π} log(1 + cos y) e^{-y}/(1 - e^{-2π}) dy, which is still not zero.\n\nGiven that all these methods are not leading to a direct evaluation, perhaps the integral is zero due to cancellation between positive and negative areas. But given that log(1 + cos x) is non-positive (since 1 + cos x ≤ 2, so log(1 + cos x) ≤ log 2, but for x where cos x < 0, log(1 + cos x) is negative, but for cos x > 0, it's positive? Wait, no. Wait, 1 + cos x ranges from 0 to 2, so log(1 + cos x) ranges from -∞ to log 2. But 1 + cos x is always non-negative, so log(1 + cos x) is real only when 1 + cos x > 0, which is always true except at x = (2k+1)π where it's zero. But log(1 + cos x) is non-positive only when 1 + cos x ≤ 1, i.e., cos x ≤ 0. So when cos x ≤ 0, log(1 + cos x) ≤ log 1 ",
