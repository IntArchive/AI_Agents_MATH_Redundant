    "Content": "Let $G$ be a group such that $|G|=pqr$, $p<q<r$ and $p,q,r$ are primes. i need to prove that: There exists a subgroup $H$ such that $H\\unlhd G$ and $|H|=qr$. $G$ is solvable. $r$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ is normal. I know the proof that $G$ isn’t a simple group, and by that I think I can prove the second part of the question, but I can’t manage to prove the first and the third parts of the question.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will provide two ways to do this. The first will be done by showing first part 3, then part 1 and then showing that part 2 follows from those. The second way will use some much more high-powered results to show something much more general, and the result will then be a special case of this. First, we will need a little lemma that will make things easier: If $H$ is a group of order $st$ with $s$ and $t$ primes and $s > t$ then $H$ has a normal subgroup of order $s$. This follows straight from Sylow's theorems, as the number of $s$-Sylows must divide $t$ and be congruent to $1$ mod $s$ (so it is $1$ as $s>t$). Now, we use the counting argument you already mentioned in the comments to see that $G$ will have a normal Sylow subgroup for at least one of the primes dividing its order. If it has one for $r$, we are done, so assume it has a normal $p$- or $q$-Sylow subgroup. Call this subgroup $N$. Now, $G/N$ has order $st$ with $s$ and $t$ primes and $s>t$ ($s = r$ and either $t = p$ or $t = q$), so we can use the lemma to conclude that $G/N$ has a normal subgroup of order $s = r$). This normal subgroup of $G/N$ then corresponds to a normal subgroup of $G$ of order either $pr$ or $qr$ (depending on whether $N$ was a $p$- or a $q$-Sylow subgroup). But now we can use the lemma again, to conclude that this subgroup has a normal subgroup of order $r$. To finish the proof of part 3, we note that if $P$ is a normal Sylow subgroup of $N$ and $N$ is normal in $G$, then $P$ is normal in $G$. This is because we know that since $P$ is normal in $N$, it is the only subgroup of that order in $N$, and conjugating $P$ by something from $G$ will give a subgroup of $N$ of the same order as $P$ (which must therefore be equal to $P$). If you have heard of characteristic subgroups, a simpler way to explain this is that any normal Sylow subgroup is in fact characteristic (this holds for any Hall subgroup in fact), and in general, if $M$ is characteristic in $N$ and $N$ is normal in $G$, then $M$ is normal in $G$. Now, with part 3 proved, we can prove part 1 quite easily, since we have a normal subgroup of order $r$, call it $M$. Now, the order of $G/M$ is $pq$ and we can apply the lemma to get a normal subgroup of order $q$, which then corresponds to a normal subgroup of $G$ of order $qr$ as we wanted. Finally, to show part 2, we now have a series of normal subgroups such that the successive quotients are abelian (in fact, the successive quotients have prime order), which shows that the group is solvable (in fact supersolvable). The more high-powered approach is this: It is a general fact (which follows from combining Burnside's transfer theorem with the N/C theorem) that if $p$ is the smallest prime dividing the order of $G$ and $p^2$ does not divide the order of $G$ (actually, unless $p = 2$ and $3$ divides the order of the group, we just need $p^3$ to not divide the order of the group), then $G$ has a normal subgroup whose index is the order of a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ (a normal $p$-complement). We can then apply the above to see that if the order of $G$ is square free, so $|G| = p_1p_2\\cdots p_n$ with $p_1>p_2>\\cdots > p_n$ with all the $p_i$ primes, then $G$ has a series of normal subgroups, such that the orders are $p_1$, $p_1p_2$, $p_1p_2p_3$, and so on up to $p_1p_2\\cdots p_n$ (one gets these in the reverse order by first getting one of index $p_n$, then one of index $p_{n-1}$ in that subgroup and so on). In particular, this shows that a group of square free order is supersolvable (and thus solvable).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is about a group G of order pqr where p < q < r are primes. We need to prove three things: there's a normal subgroup H of order qr, that G is solvable, and that the r-Sylow subgroup is normal. The user mentioned they can handle the second part (G is solvable) using the fact that G isn't simple, but they're stuck on the first and third parts. Let me focus on parts 1 and 3 then.\n\nFirst, let me recall some group theory concepts. When dealing with groups of order pqr, the Sylow theorems are essential. Since p, q, r are primes with p < q < r, the number of Sylow subgroups can be controlled using the Sylow theorems. For the first part, we need a normal subgroup of order qr. Since qr is the product of two primes, such a subgroup would be either cyclic of order qr or the direct product of Sylow q and Sylow r subgroups. But how do we show such a subgroup exists and is normal?\n\nStarting with the Sylow theorems for the r-Sylow subgroups. The number of r-Sylow subgroups, n_r, must divide pq and satisfy n_r ≡ 1 mod r. Since r is the largest prime, and p < q < r, then p, q < r. So, the divisors of pq are 1, p, q, pq. But n_r must be ≡1 mod r. Since r > q > p, the smallest possible n_r is 1 because if n_r were p or q, then p ≡1 mod r or q ≡1 mod r, which is impossible because p and q are both less than r. Similarly, pq ≡ p*q mod r, but since p and q are both less than r, their product is less than r^2, but not necessarily ≡1 mod r. However, the key point is that n_r must be 1. Because if n_r is not 1, then n_r could be p, q, or pq. But for n_r = p, we need p ≡1 mod r. Since p < r, p mod r is just p, so p ≡1 mod r implies r divides (p -1), but p < r implies p -1 < r -1, so the only way this could happen is if p -1 ≥ r, which is impossible because p < r. Similarly for n_r = q, same reasoning: q ≡1 mod r, but q < r, so q mod r is q, which would require q =1 + kr, but since q < r, the only possibility is k=0, which would imply q=1, which isn't a prime. Therefore, n_r must be 1. Therefore, the r-Sylow subgroup is normal. Wait, that would answer part 3 directly. So the third part is actually straightforward from Sylow's theorem. The user probably missed that.\n\nBut then, part 1 says there's a normal subgroup of order qr. If the r-Sylow subgroup is normal, let's call it R. Then R is normal in G. Now, consider the quotient group G/R. The order of G/R is |G|/|R| = pqr / r = pq. So G/R is a group of order pq. Since p and q are primes with p < q, then by Sylow theorems again, the q-Sylow subgroup of G/R is normal if the number of q-Sylow subgroups divides p and ≡1 mod q. The number n_q in G/R would have to divide p and satisfy n_q ≡1 mod q. Since p < q, the divisors of p are 1 and p. If n_q=1, then the q-Sylow is normal. If n_q=p, then p ≡1 mod q. But since p < q, p mod q is p, so p ≡1 mod q implies q divides (p -1), but p < q implies p -1 < q -1 < q, so q can't divide p -1. Therefore, n_q=1 in G/R, so G/R has a normal subgroup of order q. The correspondence theorem then tells us that there's a normal subgroup in G containing R, say H, such that H/R is the normal subgroup of order q in G/R. Therefore, H has order |R| * q = r * q = qr. Thus, H is a normal subgroup of G of order qr. Therefore, part 1 is proved.\n\nSo, the key steps are: first, show that the r-Sylow subgroup is normal (part 3), then use the quotient group to find a normal subgroup of order qr (part 1). Since part 3 is needed for part 1, the user might have not realized that part 3 is a stepping stone. Then, for part 2, solvability follows because G has a normal subgroup H of order qr, and H is solvable (since its order is qr, which is a product of two primes, hence metacyclic and solvable), and G/H is of order p, which is abelian, hence solvable. So the group extensions preserve solvability.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be that G is a group of order pqr with primes p < q < r. The problem is to prove the three statements. But when structuring the problem, the assumptions need to list each condition on a separate line, applied to one object. So, the original problem states |G|=pqr, p < q < r primes, and the problem is to prove the three parts. However, in the example given by the user, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem here, there's no such added condition. Therefore, the formatted problem should list all the given conditions as separate assumptions.",
