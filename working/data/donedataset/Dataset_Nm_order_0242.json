    "Content": "Let $X,Y$ be normed linear spaces. Let $T: X\\to Y$ be linear. If $X$ is finite dimensional, show\nthat $T$ is continuous. If $Y$ is finite dimensional, show that $T$ is continuous if and only if $\\ker T$ is closed. I am able to show that $X$, finite dimensional $\\implies$ $T$ is bounded, hence continuous. For the second part: This is what I have: Suppose $T$ is continuous. By definition $\\ker T = \\{ x\\in X : Tx = 0 \\}$ , and so $\\ker T$ is the continuous inverse of a closed set. Hence $\\ker T $ is closed. First, is what I have attempted okay. How about the other direction?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $\\ker(T)$ is closed then $X/\\ker(T)$ is a normed vector space. Observe that the map $\\overline{T}:X/\\ker(T)\\to Y$ given by $\\overline{T}(x+\\ker(T))=T(x)$ is a well-defined linear map by the first part $\\overline T$ is continuous since $X/\\ker(T)$ is a finite dimensional vector space (as it is isomorphic to a subspace of $Y$). Let $\\pi: X \\to X/\\ker(T)$ denote the quotient map. Note that $T=\\overline{T}\\circ \\pi$ hence $T$ is continuous since it is a composition of continuous functions.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that a linear operator T between normed spaces is continuous if and only if its kernel is closed, under certain conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions two parts. The first part is when X is finite-dimensional, and T is linear, then T is continuous. The second part is when Y is finite-dimensional, and T is linear; here, T is continuous if and only if ker T is closed. The user already did the first part and is asking about the second part, particularly the reverse direction (if ker T is closed, then T is continuous).\n\nSo for the assumption section, I need to list each condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem statement:\n\n1. X and Y are normed linear spaces.\n2. T is a linear operator from X to Y.\n3. In the second part, Y is finite-dimensional.\n4. The problem is about showing T is continuous if and only if ker T is closed.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"If Y is finite dimensional, show that T is continuous if and only if ker T is closed.\" So the assumptions here are that Y is finite-dimensional, T is linear, and the problem is to show the equivalence between T being continuous and ker T being closed.\n\nSo in the Assumption section, each line should be a single condition on one object. Let me list them:\n\n- X is a normed linear space.\n- Y is a normed linear space.\n- T: X → Y is a linear operator.\n- Y is finite-dimensional.\n\nThen the problem is: Show that T is continuous if and only if ker T is closed.\n\nWait, but the original problem's first part was about X being finite-dimensional, but the user is focusing on the second part where Y is finite-dimensional. The user's formatted example only includes relevant assumptions for the specific problem. So in the problem as presented in the question, the user is dealing with the case when Y is finite-dimensional, and they need to show T is continuous iff ker T is closed. Therefore, the assumptions should include that Y is finite-dimensional, T is linear, and X and Y are normed spaces.\n\nBut the original problem statement mentions both parts. However, in the user's question, they already did the first part (X finite-dimensional implies T continuous) and now are working on the second part (Y finite-dimensional, T continuous iff ker T closed). The user's specific problem is the second part, particularly the reverse direction (ker T closed implies T continuous).\n\nBut when structuring the problem, we need to present the problem as it is stated, not the user's progress. The original problem has two parts:\n\n1. If X is finite-dimensional, show T is continuous.\n2. If Y is finite-dimensional, show T is continuous iff ker T is closed.\n\nBut the user is asking about the second part. So when structuring, we need to present the problem as given, which includes both parts. However, in the example provided, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem included only the relevant assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's a mistake, because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't add that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a misunderstanding. Wait, in the example, perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption, but I need to check. Wait, maybe the example was wrong, but the user is following that structure. However, the instruction says to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions. So perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which contradicts. So maybe the example is incorrect, but we need to follow the user's format.\n\nWait, perhaps the example refers to a case where the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrects it? Or perhaps the user wants to extract the key assumptions from the problem. Hmm, this is confusing. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the problem on Math Stack Exchange, filter unrelated information, and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nIn the given example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. Maybe the example is wrong, but we have to proceed with the user's format.\n\nIn any case, back to the current problem. The original problem has two parts. The user is focusing on the second part. But when formatting, should we include both parts or just the part the user is working on? The example given by the user only included the specific part, adding an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example was actually a different problem where the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the example was from another source where the problem had an implicit assumption. But given that the user provided that example, we have to follow the structure.\n\nSo in the current problem, the user's question is about the second part: when Y is finite-dimensional, T is continuous iff ker T is closed. Therefore, the problem to structure is that part. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a normed linear space.\n\n- Y is a normed linear space.\n\n- T: X → Y is a linear operator.\n\n- Y is finite-dimensional.\n\nProblem: Prove that T is continuous if and only if ker T is closed.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"If Y is finite dimensional, show that T is continuous if and only if ker T is closed.\"\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- X and Y are normed linear spaces.\n\n- T: X → Y is linear.\n\n- Y is finite-dimensional.\n\nProblem: Show that T is continuous if and only if ker T is closed.\n\nTherefore, each assumption is one line. Each addresses one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a normed linear space,\n\nY is a normed linear space,\n\nT is a linear operator from X to Y,\n\nY is finite-dimensional.\n\nProblem: Prove that T is continuous if and only if ker T is closed.\n\nThat seems to fit. The user's example had two assumptions for n, so here we have four assumptions. Each is a separate line. So I think that's the way to go.",
