    "Content": "I've been working on problem 4.1.16 of Hatcher's Algebraic Topology and am at a complete impasse. The problem is as follows: Show that a map $f:X→Y$ between connected CW complexes factors as a composition $X→Z_n→Y$ where the first map induces isomorphisms on $π_n$ for $i≤n$ and the second map induces isomorphisms on $π_n$ for $i≥n+1.$ I applied Proposition 4.13 on the pair $(M_f,X)$ to get an $n$-connected CW model $(Z_n,X)$. Because $M_f$ deformation retracts to $Y$, this gives the desired isomorphisms for the second map. Moreover, because $(Z_n,X)$ is $n$-connected, the inclusion of $X$ in $Z_n$ gives the desired isomorphisms for the first map, with the exception of $π_n(X)→π_n(Z_n)$ (this map is, however, surjective). How do I prove injectivity? Any help would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't think you need the mapping cylinder or the CW model for this. Start with the factorization\n$$\nX \\xrightarrow{i} Z_0 \\xrightarrow{g} Y,\n$$ where $Z_0 = X$, $i = \\Bbb 1_X$ and $g = f$. Obviously $i_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_j$ for $j \\le n$.  We will attach $k$-cells to $Z_0$ for $k \\ge n + 1$ and extend $g$ to make $g_*$ an isomorphism on $\\pi_j$ for $j \\ge n + 1$, while keeping $i_*$ an isomorphism for $j \\le n$. We will use $Z_k$ to refer to the result of attaching $k$-cells to $Z_{k-1}$. Fix base points for $Z_0$ and $Y$. We will start by making $g_*$ surjective on $\\pi_{n+1}$. Just as in the construction of CW approximations, choose maps $\\varphi_\\alpha : S^{n+1} \\to Y$ representing the generators of the group $\\pi_{n+1}(Y)$. For each $\\varphi_\\alpha$, attach an $(n+1)$-cell via a constant map to the base point of $Z_0$. This gives us $Z_{n+1}$. Extend $g$ to $Z_{n+1}$ via the maps $\\varphi_\\alpha$. The resulting $g_*$ is surjective on $\\pi_{n+1}$ by construction. Since the pair $(Z_{n+1}, X)$ is $n$-connected, $i_*$ is still an isomorphism for $j < n$, and surjective for $j = n$. Since $Z_{n+1}$ is the wedge sum of $X$ with $(n+1)$-spheres, there is a retraction from $Z_{n+1}$ onto $X$. This makes $i_*$ injective on $\\pi_j$ for all $j$. Thus, $i_*$ is still an isomorphism on $\\pi_j$ for $j \\le n$. Now we will attach $k$-cells to $Z_{n+1}$ for $k > n + 1$ to make $g_*$ an isomorphism on $\\pi_j$ for $j \\ge n + 1$. Such cells won't affect homotopy groups for $j \\le n$, and therefore $i_*$ will remain an isomorphism in these dimensions. For each $k > n + 1$, inductively attach $k$-cells to $Z_{k-1}$ to make $g_*$ injective on $\\pi_{k-1}$ and surjective on $\\pi_k$, exactly as done in the construction of CW approximations. The end result is the desired factorization.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is working on problem 4.1.16 from Hatcher's Algebraic Topology. The goal is to show that a map between connected CW complexes factors into two maps, each inducing isomorphisms on certain homotopy groups. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that f is a map between connected CW complexes, X and Y. The factorization should be X → Z_n → Y, where the first map induces isomorphisms on π_i for i ≤ n and the second map does so for i ≥ n+1. The user mentions using Proposition 4.13 on the pair (M_f, X) to get an n-connected CW model (Z_n, X). They note that M_f deformation retracts to Y, which gives the isomorphisms for the second map. The first map's inclusion of X into Z_n is n-connected, hence the isomorphisms for i ≤ n, except possibly injectivity at π_n.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are about the connectedness of X and Y as CW complexes, the application of Proposition 4.13 to get the n-connected model, and the properties of the mapping cylinder M_f. Each assumption should be listed separately. The problem is to prove injectivity of the induced map on π_n by the first map. \n\nWait, but the original problem is to show the factorization exists. The user's specific issue is about proving injectivity of π_n(X) → π_n(Z_n). So the problem as structured should capture the main task. But according to the example given, the formatted problem should list assumptions and then the problem statement. The original problem from Hatcher is to factor the map f as described. The user's specific question is about proving injectivity of the induced map on π_n. However, the user might have rephrased parts of the problem in their question. Need to separate assumptions from the problem.\n\nAssumptions would include that X and Y are connected CW complexes, the map f: X→Y, the use of Proposition 4.13 leading to an n-connected CW model (Z_n, X), M_f deformation retracts to Y, inclusion X→Z_n is n-connected (hence iso on π_i for i < n and surjective on π_n). The problem is to show injectivity on π_n for the inclusion X→Z_n. Alternatively, the main problem is to factor f as per Hatcher's question, and the user's specific problem is the injectivity part. \n\nBut the user is asking for help on their specific step where they are stuck: proving injectivity of π_n(X) → π_n(Z_n). So the formatted problem should reflect the user's specific problem. The assumptions would include all the setup they've done: using Proposition 4.13, that Z_n is an n-connected CW model, M_f deformation retracts to Y, the inclusion X→Z_n induces isomorphisms on π_i for i < n and surjective on π_n. The problem is to prove that π_n(X)→π_n(Z_n) is injective. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main problem as per Hatcher is to factor f, but the user's specific problem is about injectivity. So the formatted problem should be the injectivity part. Let me check the example again. The example took the original problem, extracted the assumptions, and the problem. In this case, the original problem is Hatcher's 4.1.16, but the user's specific problem is about proving injectivity. So the assumptions would be the context they've built up (using Proposition 4.13, the mapping cylinder, n-connected model, etc.), and the problem is to prove injectivity of the map on π_n.\n\nSo the Assumptions would be:\n\n- X and Y are connected CW complexes.\n\n- f: X → Y is a map between connected CW complexes.\n\n- The pair (M_f, X) is used with Proposition 4.13 to obtain an n-connected CW model (Z_n, X).\n\n- M_f deformation retracts to Y, leading to the second map Z_n → Y inducing isomorphisms on π_i for i ≥ n+1.\n\n- The inclusion map X → Z_n induces isomorphisms on π_i for i < n and is surjective on π_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that the inclusion map X → Z_n induces an injective map on π_n.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to complete the proof of Hatcher's problem 4.1.16 by showing the injectivity of π_n(X) → π_n(Z_n).\n\nBut the user's exact question is: \"How do I prove injectivity?\" So the formatted problem should be that injectivity part. Therefore, the Assumptions list the setup they have done so far, and the Problem is to prove injectivity of the specific map on π_n.",
