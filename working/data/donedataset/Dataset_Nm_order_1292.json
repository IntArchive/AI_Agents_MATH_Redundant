    "AcceptedAnswer": "HINT: Not only is $\\Bbb R^2\\setminus D$ arcwise connected, but you can connect any two points with an arc consisting of at most two straight line segments. Suppose that $p,q\\in\\Bbb R^2\\setminus D$. There are uncountably many straight lines through $p$, and only countably many of those lines intersect $D$, so there are uncountably many straight lines through $p$ that don’t hit $D$. Similarly, there are uncountably many straight lines through $q$ that don’t hit $D$. Can you finish it from here?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the problem presented.\n\nThe original question is titled \"Arcwise connected part of ℝ²\" and asks to show that if D is a countable subset of ℝ² (with its usual topology), then X = ℝ² \\ D is arcwise connected. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem mentions D is a countable subset of ℝ². So that's one assumption: D is a countable subset of ℝ². Then, the topology on ℝ² is the usual one, which is standard, but the user's example didn't mention the topology as a separate assumption, maybe because it's given. However, since the problem states \"provided with its usual topology,\" perhaps I should include that as another assumption. Wait, the example given in the user's prompt didn't include the topology in the assumptions. Let me check: in the example, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n,\" and the formatted assumption was \"$n$ is an integer,\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So perhaps the topology is part of the setup but not an assumption per se. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem here is about showing arcwise connectedness of X = ℝ² \\ D. The key assumptions here are that D is countable and that we're working in ℝ² with the usual topology. Since the usual topology is the standard Euclidean topology, maybe it's considered a given and not an explicit assumption. However, to be thorough, maybe I should include it. But looking at the user's example, the original problem had the divisibility by 91, but the formatted assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted assumption listed both \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem's assumption had \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, let me check again. The original example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which would mean that the assumption should just be n is an integer, but the formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7,\" which is not part of the original problem. That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example was a misrepresentation. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Unless there was a typo, maybe the original problem was different. Hmm. But regardless, the user provided that example, so perhaps in their formatting, they split the problem's conditions into separate assumptions, even if they are combined in the original problem statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question is: Show that if D is a countable subset of ℝ² (with usual topology) then X = ℝ² \\ D is arcwise connected.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. D is a countable subset of ℝ².\n\n2. The topology on ℝ² is the usual one.\n\nBut in the example, the user included \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. Wait, but in the original example's problem statement, it was \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption would just be that n is an integer, but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7,\" which seems contradictory. Unless the original problem had a different condition. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow their format.\n\nIn the current problem, the main assumptions are:\n\n- D is a countable subset.\n\n- The space is ℝ² with usual topology.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to show that under these conditions, X is arcwise connected. So the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption: D is a subset of ℝ².\n\nAssumption: D is countable.\n\nAssumption: ℝ² is equipped with its usual topology.\n\nBut maybe the topology is part of the setup and not an assumption. However, in the problem statement, it's mentioned as part of the given, so perhaps it's better to include it. Alternatively, since the usual topology is standard, maybe it's not necessary. But to adhere to the user's example, perhaps each condition should be listed. For instance, in the example, they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" even though the original problem was \"for every integer n.\" So following that, perhaps here we should split \"D is a subset of ℝ²\" and \"D is countable.\" The usual topology might be considered part of the problem's context, but if the user's example includes conditions like divisibility, maybe we need to include the topology as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the topology is part of the problem's setting, and the key assumptions are about D. Let me think. The problem says \"D is a countable subset of ℝ² (provided with its usual topology).\" So the problem's setup includes that ℝ² has the usual topology, so perhaps that is an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. D is a subset of ℝ².\n\n2. D is countable.\n\n3. ℝ² is equipped with its usual topology.\n\nBut maybe the user's example didn't include the topology as an assumption. For instance, in the original example, the problem was about divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in that case, the example's original problem said \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption should be n is an integer, but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7,\" which changes the problem. That seems like an error in the example. Perhaps the user intended a different problem where n is divisible by 7. But regardless, I need to follow their structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the key conditions are:\n\n- D is a subset of ℝ².\n\n- D is countable.\n\n- The topology is usual.\n\nBut perhaps the user would consider only the first two as assumptions, as the third is part of the standard setup. Alternatively, since it's explicitly mentioned, it's better to include it.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions line by line:\n\nAssumption: D is a subset of ℝ².\n\nAssumption: D is countable.\n\nAssumption: ℝ² is provided with its usual topology.\n\nThen the problem is to show that X = ℝ² \\ D is arcwise connected.\n\nBut perhaps the user's example didn't split \"subset\" and \"countable.\" Let me check again. The original example's problem was about n being an integer, and the formatted assumption had two lines: \"$n$ is an integer,\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So in that case, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" the formatted version added another condition. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should not restrict n to being divisible by 7. So perhaps the example provided by the user is incorrect. Maybe there was a miscommunication. However, given that, I need to follow the user's instruction, which is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem states \"D is a countable subset of ℝ² (provided with its usual topology).\" So D is a subset of ℝ², D is countable, and the topology is usual. So three separate assumptions. However, maybe \"subset of ℝ²\" and \"countable\" can be combined as \"D is a countable subset of ℝ²,\" but the user's example split \"integer\" and \"divisible by 7,\" so perhaps we should split \"subset\" and \"countable.\"\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption: D is a subset of ℝ².\n\nAssumption: D is countable.\n\nAssumption: The topology on ℝ² is the usual topology.\n\nProblem: Show that X = ℝ² \\ D is arcwise connected.\n\nAlternatively, since \"subset of ℝ²\" and \"countable\" are both properties of D, maybe they should be separate. For example, in the user's example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So similarly, here, \"D is a subset of ℝ²\" and \"D is countable\" would be two separate assumptions. The third assumption about the topology is separate.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: D is a subset of ℝ².\n\nAssumption: D is countable.\n\nAssumption: ℝ² is provided with its usual topology.\n\nProblem: Show that X = ℝ² \\ D is arcwise connected.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the topology is given as part of the setup, so maybe the third assumption is redundant. But since the user included \"provided with its usual topology\" in the problem statement, perhaps it's better to list it as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the topology is part of the problem's context and not an assumption. But according to the user's example, even obvious conditions are listed as assumptions. For instance, in the example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, which was listed as an assumption. Similarly, here, the problem states that D is a subset of ℝ² with usual topology, so the assumptions would include that.\n\nI think I should list all three: D is a subset, D is countable, and the topology is usual. Each on separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: D is a subset of ℝ².\n\nAssumption: D is countable.\n\nAssumption: ℝ² is equipped with its usual topology.\n\nProblem: Show that X = ℝ² \\ D is arcwise connected.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the format, splitting each condition into separate lines.",
