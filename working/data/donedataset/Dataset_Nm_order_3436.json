    "Content": "This is a real-analysis homework question so I of course have to be very precise and justify anything or any theorem I use. If $b_n$ is a bounded sequence and $\\lim(a_n) = 0$, show that $\\lim(a_nb_n) = 0$ Intuitively, since $b_n$ is bounded, then sup($b_n$) is some finite number and therefore we can take an $N$ natural number as large as we need such that for all $n\\gt N$ $b_na_n$ approaches $0$. At first I thought to use the limit theorems, but since $a_n$ is not bounded, the general limit theorems do not reply. (I am referring to $\\lim(X + Y) = \\lim X + \\lim Y$ for $X,Y$ sequences etc). I was thinking then to use the definition of the limit somehow to show that since $b_n$ is bounded we can take as intuitively stated above $N$ large enough to show the statement is true.  I'm not sure how to proceed with this. Thank you for your replies in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You want to show that the absolute value of $b_na_n$ can be made arbitrarily small. But, there exists a positive constant $M$ such that for all $n$, $|b_n|\\leq M$, since the sequence $(b_n)$ is bounded. Thus $|b_na_n|\\leq M|a_n|$ for all $n$. Since the sequence $(a_n)$ converges to 0, this is all you should need. The argument is basically the Squeeze Theorem from elementary calculus.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, the original problem is: If \\( b_n \\) is a bounded sequence and \\( \\lim a_n = 0 \\), show that \\( \\lim(a_nb_n) = 0 \\).\n\nLooking at the assumptions, there are two main points here. The first is that \\( b_n \\) is a bounded sequence. So that's one assumption. The second is that the limit of \\( a_n \\) as \\( n \\) approaches infinity is 0. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions.\n\nThe problem then is to show that the limit of the product sequence \\( a_nb_n \\) is 0. \n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. However, in this current problem, the user hasn't mentioned any such specific divisibility. The two main conditions are the boundedness of \\( b_n \\) and the convergence of \\( a_n \\) to 0. \n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single condition on one object. So:\n\n1. \\( b_n \\) is a bounded sequence.\n2. \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0 \\).\n\nThese are two separate assumptions. The problem is to show that the limit of \\( a_nb_n \\) is 0. \n\nI don't see any other hidden assumptions here. The user didn't mention anything else in the problem statement. The question is about proving the limit of the product sequence, given these two conditions. So the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and then the problem statement as given.",
