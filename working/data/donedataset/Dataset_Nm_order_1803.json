    "Content": "Prove that \n$\nn < 2^{n} \n$\nfor all natural numbers $n$. I tried this with induction: Inequality clearly holds when $n=1$. Supposing that when $n=k$, $k<2^{k}$. Considering $k+1 <2^{k}+1$, but where do I go from here? Any other methods maybe?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proof by induction. Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Step $1.$: Let $n=1$  $\\Rightarrow$  $n\\lt2^{n}$ holds, since $ 1\\lt 2$. Step $2.$: Assume $ n \\lt 2^{n}$ holds where $n=k$ and $k \\geq 1$. Step $3.$: Prove $n \\lt 2^{n}$ holds for $n = k+ 1$ and $ k\\geq 1$ to complete the proof. $k \\lt 2^{k}$, using step $2$. $2\\times k \\lt 2\\times2^{k}$ $ 2k \\lt 2^{k+1}\\quad(1)$ On the other hand, $k \\gt 1 \\Rightarrow k + 1 \\lt k+k = 2k$. Hence $k+1\\lt2k\\quad(2)$ By merging results (1) and (2). $k + 1 \\lt 2k \\lt 2^{k+1}$ $k + 1 \\lt 2^{k+1}$ Hence, $ n \\lt 2^{n}$ holds for all $ n \\in \\mathbb{N}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. Let me look at the example they provided to make sure I get the format right. \n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving that A(n) is divisible by 91. The assumptions listed were two separate points: that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was rephrased. \n\nNow, looking at the current problem: \"Prove that n < 2^n for all natural numbers n.\" The user on Math Stack Exchange tried induction but got stuck after showing the base case and the assumption step. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"for all natural numbers n.\" In mathematics, natural numbers typically start at 1, but sometimes include 0. However, the user mentioned the base case when n=1, so here the natural numbers start at 1. So the main assumption here is that n is a natural number. There might be a temptation to list multiple assumptions, but the example shows each assumption as a single line addressing one property. Since the problem is a universal statement over all natural numbers, the key assumption is that n is a natural number. \n\nWait, in the example, they had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, there's only one condition: n is a natural number. So I need to list that. But wait, maybe the problem also implicitly assumes something else? Let me check.\n\nThe problem statement is straightforward: for all natural numbers n, n < 2^n. So the only assumption needed is that n is a natural number. There are no additional constraints like divisibility unless specified. The original example had an extra condition because the problem statement included that n must be divisible by 7. Here, the problem is for all natural numbers, so just the one assumption. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: n is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that n < 2^n.\n\nWait, but looking back at the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem listed both. So in this case, since there's only one assumption (n is natural), that's all that's needed. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The user tried induction, starting at n=1, which is correct. The problem is for all natural numbers n, so no additional constraints. So the formatted problem should be as above. \n\nLet me double-check. The user's example had two assumptions because the problem required n to be an integer divisible by 7. Here, the problem is for all natural numbers, so the only assumption is n is a natural number. Therefore, I should structure it accordingly.",
