For every natural number $n \\in \\Bbb{N}$ , there exists a finite set of consecutive numbers $C\\subset \\Bbb{N}$ containing $n$ such that $\\sum\\limits_{c\\in C} c$ is a prime power.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "For any odd prime $p$ , there are $p$ consecutive integers centred on $p$ that sum to $p^2$ . $2+3+4=3^2$ $3+4+5+6+7=5^2$ $4+5+6+7+8+9+10=7^2$ etc. Let $p_n$ be the $n$ -th prime. Then, using Bertrand's postulate in the form $$p_{n+1}<2p_n$$ we know that the above sums for consecutive primes overlap. Finally, we note that $1+2=3$ to complete the proof. I don't know if this has been shown before, but the proof seems straightforward.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: the title is \"Every natural number is covered by consecutive numbers that sum to a prime power.\" The question presents a conjecture that for every natural number n, there exists a finite set of consecutive numbers containing n such that their sum is a prime power. The user also provided some examples with numbers and their corresponding prime power sums.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The conjecture states \"for every natural number n ∈ ℕ,\" so one assumption is that n is a natural number. The problem is to prove that such a set of consecutive numbers exists for each n, with the sum being a prime power. The original question also asks if this has been proved already, but in the example provided by the user, the \"Problem\" part is the statement to be proved, so I should focus on that.\n\nThe example in the user's instruction for the formatted problem included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the conjecture applies to every natural number, so the only assumption is that n is a natural number. The problem is to show there's a finite set of consecutive numbers containing n with the sum a prime power.\n\nWait, the original problem's question includes \"Has this been proved already?\" but according to the example, the problem part should be the actual mathematical statement to prove. So in the formatted problem, we need to present the conjecture as the problem to prove, ignoring the question about whether it's already proven because that's part of the original question's inquiry, not the problem statement itself. The user's example filtered out unrelated information, so here the \"Has this been proved already?\" is probably extraneous and should be excluded from the problem statement.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\nThe problem is to prove that for every natural number n, there exists a finite set of consecutive numbers C containing n such that the sum of elements in C is a prime power.\n\nChecking the example again: the original problem had an expression A(n) and the formatted problem listed the assumptions and then the problem statement. Here, the key elements are that n is a natural number, and the existence of such a set C. The other details in the question, like the list of numbers and their covers, are examples and can be considered as extraneous information, so they should be filtered out.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have one assumption (n is a natural number) and the problem statement as per the conjecture.",
