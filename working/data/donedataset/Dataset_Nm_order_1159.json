    "Content": "Let $f: [0,\\infty) \\to [0,\\infty)$ be a continuous function such that $f(f(x)) = x^2, \\forall x \\in [0,\\infty)$. Prove that $\\displaystyle{\\int_{0}^{1}{(f(x))^2dx} \\geq \\frac{3}{13}}$. All I know about this function is that $f$ is bijective, it is strictly increasing*, $f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(x^2) = (f(x))^2, \\forall x \\in [0, \\infty)$ and $f(x) \\leq x, \\forall x \\in [0, 1]$**. With all these, I am not able to show that  $\\displaystyle{\\int_{0}^{1}{(f(x))^2dx} \\geq \\frac{3}{13}}$. *Suppose that $f$ is strictly decreasing. Then, $\\forall x \\in (0,1), x^2 < x \\implies f(x^2) > f(x) \\iff (f(x))^2 > f(x) \\iff f(x) > 1$, which is false because, if we substitute $x$ with $0$ and with $1$ in $f(x^2) = (f(x))^2$ we get that $f(0) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $f(1) \\in \\{0,1\\}$. So $f$ is strictly increasing. **Suppose that there exists $x_0 \\in [0, 1]$ such that $f(x_0) > x_0$. Then, $x_0^2 = f(f(x_0)) > f(x_0) > x_0$, which is false. Then $f(x) \\leq x, \\forall x \\in [0,1]$. Edit: I have come up with an idea to use Riemann sums, but I reach a point where I cannot continue. Let $\\epsilon < 1$. Then $f(\\epsilon) = x_1$ and $f(x_1) = \\epsilon^2$. And now $(f(\\epsilon))^2 = f(\\epsilon^2) = x_2$ and so on. Now we will use the Riemann sum: We will take the partition $\\Delta = (1 > \\epsilon > \\epsilon ^2 > ... \\epsilon ^{2^n} >0 ) $and the intermediate points will be the left margin of each interval. Then we have: $\\displaystyle{\\int_{0}^{1}{(f(x))^2 dx}}  = \\displaystyle{ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 1}{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}{\\sum_{k = 0}^{n}{(\\epsilon^{2^k} - \\epsilon^{2^{k+1}})\\epsilon^{2^{k+1}}}}}}$ I do not know how to compute this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It took a while, but I finally managed to have a solution. I will show that $\\displaystyle{\\int_0^1{(f(x))^2dx} = 1-4\\int_0^1{x^3f(x)dx}}$ . (*) For $n \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$ , let $D_n = (\\displaystyle{0, \\frac{1}{n}, ..., \\frac{n-1}{n}},1)$ and $E_n = (\\displaystyle{0, f(\\frac{1}{n}), ..., f(\\frac{n-1}{n}),1})$ be two divisions on the interval $[0,1]$ . Evidently, $||D_n|| = \\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{n}}$ , so $\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}{||D_n||} = 0}$ . Because $f$ is a continuous function, then it is also uniformly continuous, so $\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}{||E_n||} = 0}$ . Let $\\xi_i = \\displaystyle{\\frac{i}{n}}$ . Now I will write the Riemann sum for $f^2$ for the division $E_n$ (upper Darboux sum). $S_{E_n}(f^2) = \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i=1}^n{(f(f(\\xi_i)))^2(f(\\xi_i) - (f(\\xi_{i-1})))} = \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\xi_i^4(f(\\xi_i)-f(\\xi_{i-1}))}}$ . We can rewrite this sum: $S_{E_n}(f^2) = \\xi_n^4 f(\\xi_n) - \\xi_0^4 f(\\xi_0) + \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f(\\xi_{i-1})(\\xi_{i-1}^4 - \\xi_i^4)} = 1- \\sum_{i=1}^n{f(\\xi_{i-1})(\\xi_{i}^4 - \\xi_{i-1}^4)} = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^n{f(\\xi_{i-1})(\\xi_i^3 + \\xi_i^2\\xi_{i-1} + \\xi_i\\xi_{i-1}^x + \\xi_{i-1}^3)(\\xi_i - \\xi_{i-1})}}$ . Also, $4\\xi_{i-1}^3 f(\\xi_{i-1}) \\leq f(\\xi_{i-1})(\\xi_i^3 + \\xi_i^2\\xi_{i-1} + \\xi_i\\xi_{i-1}^x + \\xi_{i-1}^3)(\\xi_i - \\xi_{i-1}) \\leq 4\\xi_i^3 f(\\xi_i)$ . Considering the function $h : [0,1] \\to [0,1], h(x) = x^3f(x)$ , we obtain that: $s_{D_n}(h) < \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i=1}^n{f(\\xi_{i-1})(\\xi_i^3 + \\xi_i^2\\xi_{i-1} + \\xi_i\\xi_{i-1}^x + \\xi_{i-1}^3)(\\xi_i - \\xi_{i-1})}} < S_{D_n}(h)$ , where $s_{D_n}(h)$ and $S_{D_n}(h)$ represent the Darboux sums(lower and upper, respectively) for the function $h$ and the division $D_n$ . Therefore, we have that $\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}{\\sum_{i=1}^n{f(\\xi_{i-1})(\\xi_i^3 + \\xi_i^2\\xi_{i-1} + \\xi_i\\xi_{i-1}^x + \\xi_{i-1}^3)(\\xi_i - \\xi_{i-1})}} = \\int_0^1{h(x)dx} = 4\\int_0^1{x^3f(x)dx}}$ . Now, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have that: $\\displaystyle{\\int_0^1{x^3f(x)dx} \\leq \\sqrt{\\int_0^1{x^6dx} \\cdot \\int_0^1{(f(x))^2dx}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\int_0^1{(f(x))^2dx}}{7}}}$ . (**) Let $a = \\displaystyle{\\int_0^1{(f(x))^2dx}}$ . Using (*) and (**), we obtain that $\\displaystyle{0 < 1-a \\leq 4\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{7}}}$ , therefore $(1-a)^2 \\leq \\displaystyle{\\frac{16a}{7}} \\iff 7a^2 - 30a + 7 \\leq 0 \\implies a \\geq \\displaystyle{\\frac{15 - \\sqrt{176}}{7}}$ . Finally, $\\displaystyle{\\int_0^1{(f(x))^2dx} \\geq \\frac{15 - \\sqrt{176}}{7} > 0,24 > \\frac{3}{13}}$ , so we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, listing all assumptions line by line and then the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The problem is about proving that the integral of (f(x))² from 0 to 1 is at least 3/13, given that f is a continuous function from [0, ∞) to itself satisfying f(f(x)) = x² for all x. \n\nThe user provided some properties they derived: f is bijective, strictly increasing, f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(x²) = (f(x))² for all x, and f(x) ≤ x on [0,1]. They also mentioned an attempt using Riemann sums but got stuck.\n\nMy task is to extract all the assumptions from the problem. The problem statement itself mentions that f: [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) is continuous, and f(f(x)) = x² for all x. Then, from the user's analysis, they derived additional properties. However, the original problem might not state all these properties explicitly; some are derived by the user. But according to the example given, the assumptions should include all conditions given in the problem, not the derived ones. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, looking back at the example: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, no. Wait the original problem was \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake or maybe the example was a bad one. Wait, perhaps the user in the example made an error, but the key point is that the assumptions should list all the given conditions, not the derived ones.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that doesn't make sense because if n is any integer, but in the formatted problem, it's adding \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user intended to show that the original problem had an error, and they corrected the assumptions? Hmm. Maybe the example is flawed, but the instruction here is to structure the problem as per the format, listing the assumptions given in the problem, not the ones derived by the user. So for the current problem, I need to list the assumptions provided in the problem statement, not the ones the user deduced. Wait, but in the original problem on Math Stack Exchange, the user has stated some derived properties, but the actual problem statement is:\n\n\"Let f: [0,∞) → [0,∞) be a continuous function such that f(f(x)) = x², ∀x ∈ [0,∞). Prove that ∫₀¹ (f(x))² dx ≥ 3/13.\"\n\nSo the original problem gives that f is continuous, domain and codomain [0,∞), and the functional equation f(f(x)) = x². The rest of the properties (bijective, strictly increasing, f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(x²) = (f(x))², f(x) ≤ x on [0,1]) are derived by the user in their attempt. Therefore, according to the format, the assumptions should be the ones given in the problem, not the derived ones. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) is continuous,\n- f(f(x)) = x² for all x ∈ [0, ∞).\n\nThen the problem is to prove the integral is at least 3/13. However, in the example provided by the user, they included assumptions that might have been derived (like n divisible by 7), but that seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe the example was wrong. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless there was a typo, and maybe the original problem had \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but the user in the example made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the actual correct assumptions should only include what's given in the problem. So in the original problem here, the actual given assumptions are:\n\n- f is defined from [0, ∞) to [0, ∞),\n- f is continuous,\n- f(f(x)) = x² for all x ∈ [0, ∞).\n\nThe rest (bijective, strictly increasing, etc.) are derived by the user and hence should not be included in the assumptions section. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"All I know about this function is that...\" followed by those properties. But the problem statement itself might not include those; perhaps the user derived them and listed them as known properties. So in the problem statement, the only given conditions are f is continuous, domain and codomain, and the functional equation. The rest are derived. Therefore, the assumptions should only be the given ones, not the derived ones.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user says \"Let f: [0,∞) → [0,∞) be a continuous function such that f(f(x)) = x², ∀x ∈ [0,∞). Prove that ∫₀¹ (f(x))² dx ≥ 3/13.\" So the problem as stated has the function f being continuous, mapping [0,∞) to [0,∞), and satisfying f(f(x)) = x². So those are the given assumptions. The other properties like bijectivity, strictly increasing, f(0)=0, f(1)=1, etc., are derived by the user in their attempt. Therefore, according to the format, the assumptions should be:\n\n- f: [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) is continuous,\n- f(f(x)) = x² for all x ∈ [0, ∞).\n\nBut in the example, the user included derived assumptions, which seems conflicting. Wait, no—the example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the user in the example mistakenly added an extra condition. Maybe the example is wrong, but following the correct approach, the assumptions should list only what's given in the problem statement, not the derived properties. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is defined on the domain [0, ∞),\n- f maps to [0, ∞),\n- f is continuous,\n- f(f(x)) = x² for all x ∈ [0, ∞).\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"Let f: [0,∞) → [0,∞) be a continuous function such that f(f(x)) = x², ∀x ∈ [0,∞).\" So these are the given conditions. So each of these should be separate assumptions:\n\n1. The domain of f is [0, ∞),\n2. The codomain of f is [0, ∞),\n3. f is continuous,\n4. For all x in [0, ∞), f(f(x)) = x².\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. However, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So perhaps the original problem had those conditions. But in our current problem, the conditions are the domain, codomain, continuity, and functional equation.\n\nBut wait, the original problem might have had f being defined on [0,∞) to [0,∞), which is one assumption, but the format requires each assumption to address only one property applied to one object. So perhaps split into:\n\n- f is a function from [0, ∞) to [0, ∞),\n- f is continuous,\n- For all x in [0, ∞), f(f(x)) = x².\n\nEach of these is one line. Then the problem is to prove the integral is at least 3/13.\n\nBut the user's own analysis mentions f is bijective, strictly increasing, etc., but those are derived properties, not given. So according to the instructions, we should filter the unrelated information and structure the problem with the given assumptions. Therefore, the answer should list the assumptions as given in the problem statement, split into individual lines. Then the problem is the integral inequality.",
