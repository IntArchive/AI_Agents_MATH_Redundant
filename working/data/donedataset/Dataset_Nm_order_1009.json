    "Content": "In exercise 36 Miscellaneous Taylor Coefficients using Bernoulli\nnumbers on pages 88-89 of Louis Comtet's Advanced Combinatorics , 1974,\none is asked to obtain the following explicit formula for the Bernoulli numbers: $$B_{2n}=(-1)^{n-1}\\dfrac{1+\\left[ \\varphi _{n}\\right] }{2(2^{2n}-1)},$$ where $$\\varphi _{n}=\\dfrac{2(2^{2n}-1)(2n)!}{2^{2n-1}\\pi ^{2n}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{3n}\\dfrac{1}{k^{2n}}$$ (with $\\displaystyle\\sum_{n\\geq 0}B_{n}\\dfrac{t^{n}}{n!}=\\dfrac{t}{e^{t}-1}$ ), and to prove, among other sums, that $$\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\dfrac{1}{\\dbinom{2n}{n}}=\\dfrac{1}{3}+\\dfrac{2\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{27}.\\qquad (\\ast )$$ Alfred van der Poorten wrote here (section 10) : seeing that $$\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{x^{2n}}{n^{2}\\dbinom{2n}{n}}=2\\arcsin^{2}\\left( \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right) \\qquad (\\ast \\ast )$$ (...) formula [ $(\\ast )$ ] become [s] quite accessible to proof .\" I am not able to show formula $(\\ast \\ast )$ neither how it can be used to\nprove $(\\ast )$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Another one, which has been mentioned multiple times on this site (search for Wallis' product) is the following: $$\\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\sin^{2n-1} x \\ dx = \\dfrac{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdots (2n-2)}{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdots (2n-1)} \\ \\ n \\gt 1$$ Now $$\\displaystyle \\dfrac{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdots (2n-2)}{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdots (2n-1)} = \\dfrac{2^{2n}}{2n{2n \\choose n}} = \\dfrac{2^{2n-1}}{n{2n \\choose n}}$$ Thus $$\\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} n\\left(\\dfrac{\\sin x}{2}\\right)^{2n-1} \\ dx = \\dfrac{1}{{2n \\choose n}}$$ Now the sum can be found easily. The formula by Alfred Van der Pooten can be proved using this approach too. A proof of Wallis Product is given here: http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/pi/wallis.xhtml For a (closely related) problem on this site using this, see here: Summing the series $(-1)^k \\frac{(2k)!!}{(2k+1)!!} a^{2k+1}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving the sum \\(27\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\binom{2n}{n}} = 9 + 2\\pi \\sqrt{3}\\). They also mention using the identity involving the arcsin squared function. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions from the problem. The problem statement references an exercise from Comtet's Advanced Combinatorics. The main goal is to prove the given sum. The user also mentions another identity, equation (**), which is the power series involving \\(x^{2n}\\) divided by \\(n^2 \\binom{2n}{n}\\) equaling \\(2\\arcsin^2(x/2)\\). The user is asking for hints on how to use (**) to prove (*), or alternative methods.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are the various conditions and given formulas. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. The problem relates to proving an identity involving an infinite sum of reciprocals of binomial coefficients.\n2. The specific sum to prove is \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{27} \\).\n3. A related identity is given: \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{2n}}{n^2 \\binom{2n}{n}} = 2\\arcsin^2\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\).\n4. The Bernoulli numbers are defined via the generating function \\( \\sum_{n\\geq 0} B_n \\frac{t^n}{n!} = \\frac{t}{e^t - 1} \\).\n5. Other sums provided for context include those involving \\( \\frac{1}{n\\binom{2n}{n}} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{n^2\\binom{2n}{n}} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{n^4\\binom{2n}{n}} \\), but these might not be directly relevant to the main problem.\n\nWait, the problem specifically asks about proving equation (*), which is the sum of \\(1/\\binom{2n}{n}\\) from n=1 to infinity. The user is stuck on using equation (**) to derive this. The original problem also mentions that van der Poorten suggested using (**) to make (*) accessible. \n\nSo, the key assumptions here would include the given identity (**), the definition of Bernoulli numbers (though maybe not directly necessary for this particular sum), and the other sums provided as context. However, since the user is focusing on (*), the main assumptions are:\n\n- The sum \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{2n}}{n^2 \\binom{2n}{n}} = 2\\arcsin^2(x/2) \\).\n- The Bernoulli numbers' generating function (but maybe this is part of the original exercise's context, not directly needed for proving (*) via (**)).\n- The other sums are additional results but not assumptions for the problem at hand.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove the specific sum (*), and the user is asking how to use (**) to do that. Therefore, the main assumption is the validity of (**), and possibly the relation between the two sums. Also, the problem may assume knowledge of binomial coefficients properties and series manipulations.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, assumptions are specific conditions on variables. Here, the problem is to prove an identity, so the assumptions would be any given conditions or formulas that are taken as true to use in the proof. Since (**) is given as an identity, that's an assumption. Also, the problem may involve manipulating (**) to get to (*). \n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption: \nThe identity \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{2n}}{n^2 \\binom{2n}{n}} = 2\\left(\\arcsin\\left( \\frac{x}{2} \\right)\\right)^2 \\) holds for relevant x.\nThe problem is to prove that \\( 27\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\binom{2n}{n}} = 9 + 2\\pi \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nBut the original problem mentions that equation (*) can be derived using (**), so the key assumption is the validity of (**). Other context like Bernoulli numbers might not be directly relevant here unless needed, but since the user is focusing on using (**) to prove (*), the main assumption is (**).\n\nSo, the formatted problem should list the key assumption of (**) and then state the problem as proving (*). The other sums mentioned (like with 1/(n binom(2n,n)) are additional results but not assumptions for this problem.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem isn't stating conditions on variables but rather that a certain identity holds and needs to be used. So, the assumption here is the given identity (**), which is taken as true to use in proving (*).\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list that the identity (**) is valid, and then the Problem is to prove (*) using that. However, the user is also asking for alternative methods, but the main structure should capture the core problem and its assumptions.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe identity \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{2n}}{n^2 \\binom{2n}{n}} = 2\\left( \\arcsin\\left( \\frac{x}{2} \\right) \\right)^2 \\) holds.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( 27\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\binom{2n}{n}} = 9 + 2\\pi \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions that van der Poorten suggested using (**) to prove (*), perhaps the assumption is that (**) is a known identity, and the problem is to use it to derive (*).\n\nAnother point: the original problem also includes the generating function for Bernoulli numbers, but since the user is focusing on (*), maybe that's part of the context but not an assumption needed for proving (*) via (**). So the key assumption is (**).\n\nAdditionally, the problem might have the assumption that the sum converges, but that's generally part of the problem statement.\n\nSo, to stick to the user's example, which listed specific mathematical conditions, here the main assumption is the identity (**). Therefore, the formatted problem should list that as an assumption and then state the problem to prove (*).",
