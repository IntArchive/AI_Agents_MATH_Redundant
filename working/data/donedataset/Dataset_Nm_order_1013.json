    "Content": "(One version of) the Whitehead theorem states that a homology equivalence between simply connected CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence. Does the following generalisation hold true? Suppose $X,Y$ are two connected CW complexes and $f:X\\to Y$ is a continuous map that induces isomorphisms of the fundamental groups and on homology. Then $f$ is a weak equivalence. It would be enough to show that the map $\\tilde{f}$ obtained by lifting $f$ to the universal covers (for some arbitrary choice of base points) is a homology equivalence, but I've never studied the homology spectral sequence, so I don't know the relationship between the homology of the universal cover $\\widetilde{X}$ and that of $X$ , and I don't know how to prove that $\\tilde{f}$ is a homology equivalence. Also, are there any good, reasonably self contained and short accounts of the homology of covering spaces, preferably online? EDIT 1 I've seen some lecture notes (second paragraph on page 5) where this theorem is used (without further comment). They used this proposition to establish that a certain type of homotopy colimit is well defined up to weak equivalence. EDIT 2 Theorem 6.71 from Kirk and Davis (page 179 of the document or 164 internally) is probably what I need, but it involves isomorphisms with local coefficient systems for homology for the base spaces. EDIT 3 Thank you @studiosus for the reference. I don't quite understand yet, could you help out? If I get it (using the theorem of the source ), there are finite connected two dimensional complexes $X,Y$ and a homotopy equivalence $X\\vee S^2\\simeq Y\\vee S^2$ , yet $X$ and $Y$ aren't homotopy equivalent. From the assumption it follows immediately that $$X\\hookrightarrow X\\vee S^2\\to Y\\vee S^2\\twoheadrightarrow Y$$ gives an isomorphism of the fundamental groups. From $$\\tilde{H}(X)\\oplus\\tilde{H}(S^2)\\simeq\\tilde{H}(X\\vee S^2)\\simeq\\tilde{H}(Y\\vee S^2)\\simeq\\tilde{H}(X)\\oplus\\tilde{H}(S^2)\\;,$$ $\\tilde{H}(S^2)\\simeq \\Bbb Z[2]$ and the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, it follows at once that $\\tilde{H}(X)\\simeq\\tilde{H}(Y)$ abstractly . The only problem I have is that it doesn't seem to me that we get a map $X\\to Y$ that induces isomorphisms on $\\pi_1$ and is a homology equivalence, actually, I don't see why there should be a homology equivalence $X\\to Y$ at all .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The answer is no. An easy example is provided in Allen Hatcher's Algebraic Topology, Example 4.35. https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATch4.pdf There, a CW-complex $X$ is formed by attaching an appropriate $(n+1)$ -cell to the wedge $S^1 \\vee S^n$ of a circle and an $n$ -sphere. The inclusion of the $1$ -skeleton $S^1 \\to X$ induces an isomorphism on integral homology and on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < n$ but not on $\\pi_n$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me read through the original problem carefully. The user is asking about a generalization of the Whitehead theorem for non-simply connected spaces. The original Whitehead theorem states that a homology equivalence between simply connected CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence. The user wants to know if this holds when the spaces are connected but not necessarily simply connected, provided the map induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups and homology.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem. The question mentions two connected CW complexes, X and Y, with a continuous map f: X → Y. The map f induces isomorphisms on fundamental groups and on homology. The goal is to prove whether f is a weak equivalence under these conditions.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n1. X and Y are connected CW complexes.\n2. f: X → Y is a continuous map.\n3. f induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups (π₁).\n4. f induces isomorphisms on homology groups.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The user also mentions trying to use the universal cover and homology spectral sequences, but those details might be part of their thought process rather than the problem's assumptions. The main problem is whether, given those four conditions, f is a weak equivalence. So I need to structure the problem with those assumptions and the stated problem.\n\nLet me check the example provided. In the example, the original problem had an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted version listed n as an integer and then n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example has a typo? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that contradicts. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That must be a mistake. But the user provided that as their example. Hmm. Maybe in their example, they wanted to filter out an incorrect assumption? Or perhaps there was a miscommunication. Anyway, in the current problem, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem as per the example, even if the example seems to have an error. So in the current problem, the user is asking about the generalization of Whitehead's theorem where X and Y are connected CW complexes, and the map f induces isomorphisms on π₁ and homology. The problem is to prove whether f is a weak equivalence under those assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n- X and Y are connected CW complexes.\n- f: X → Y is a continuous map.\n- f induces an isomorphism on π₁(X) → π₁(Y).\n- f induces isomorphisms on all homology groups.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is a weak equivalence. The user also mentions considering the lift to universal covers, but that seems part of their approach, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the main problem is stated as: \"Suppose X,Y are two connected CW complexes and f:X→Y is a continuous map that induces isomorphisms of the fundamental groups and on homology. Then f is a weak equivalence.\"\n\nSo structuring that into the format:\n\nAssumption: X is a connected CW complex.\nAssumption: Y is a connected CW complex.\nAssumption: f: X → Y is a continuous map.\nAssumption: f induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups π₁(X) → π₁(Y).\nAssumption: f induces isomorphisms on all homology groups Hₙ(X) → Hₙ(Y) for each n ≥ 0.\nProblem: Prove that f is a weak equivalence.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user is asking if the generalization holds true. So the problem is to determine whether under these assumptions, f is a weak equivalence. So the problem statement is: \"Does the following generalization hold true? Suppose X,Y are two connected CW complexes and f:X→Y is a continuous map that induces isomorphisms of the fundamental groups and on homology. Then f is a weak equivalence.\"\n\nBut the example given by the user had \"Prove that...\" So maybe the user wants to present the problem as a statement to be proven. However, the original question is phrased as a yes/no question. But in the example, they rephrased the problem into \"Prove that...\". So perhaps in this case, the problem should be phrased as \"Prove or disprove that f is a weak equivalence under the given assumptions.\"\n\nBut the user's example took the original problem which was \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and formatted it as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions that n is integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was for every integer n, which would not require n to be divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example had a different original problem where the user made a mistake. Anyway, perhaps the current problem should follow the structure where the assumptions are all the given conditions, and the problem is the question. So in this case, the problem is the question: \"Does the generalization hold true? That is, prove or disprove that f is a weak equivalence given the assumptions.\"\n\nBut according to the user's example, they took the original problem's statement and rephrased the assumptions, even adding an extra one (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original. Wait, that might be a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to filter out unnecessary information. So maybe in the current problem, we need to extract the key assumptions from the original question.\n\nOriginal question: Suppose X,Y are two connected CW complexes and f:X→Y is a continuous map that induces isomorphisms of the fundamental groups and on homology. Then f is a weak equivalence. It would be enough to show that the map tilde{f} obtained by lifting f to the universal covers ... is a homology equivalence.\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n- X and Y are connected CW complexes.\n- f is continuous.\n- f induces π₁ isomorphism.\n- f induces homology isomorphisms.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is a weak equivalence.\n\nIn the user's example, they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So I need to list each assumption separately. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: X is a connected CW complex.\nAssumption: Y is a connected CW complex.\nAssumption: f: X → Y is a continuous map.\nAssumption: f induces an isomorphism between the fundamental groups of X and Y.\nAssumption: f induces isomorphisms on all homology groups of X and Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is a weak equivalence.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The user also discusses universal covers and spectral sequences, but those are part of their approach, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the formatted problem should include only the given conditions and the problem statement.",
