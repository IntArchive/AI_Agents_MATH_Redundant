    "Content": "I hope it's not too long winded, but I prefer to give a short intro hoping for a last chance to go over this in my head and catch any error. Here's a primitive example of a field extension: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt 2) = \\{a + b\\sqrt 2 \\;|\\; a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$.  It's easy to show that it is a commutative additive group with identity $0$.  It's a little more involved to show that once $0$ is taken out (which rules out $a = b = 0$), what's left is a multiplicative group with identity $1$ and multiplicative inverse\n$$\\dfrac{1}{a + b\\sqrt 2} = \\dfrac{1}{a + b\\sqrt 2}\\dfrac{a - b\\sqrt 2}{a - b\\sqrt 2} = \\dfrac{a - b\\sqrt 2}{a^2 - 2b^2} = \\dfrac{a}{a^2 - 2b^2} + \\dfrac{- b}{a^2 - 2b^2}\\sqrt 2$$\nwhich always exists because $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ ensures that the denominator in the above equation can never equal zero and since $a$ and $b$ cannot both be $0$ neither can the inverse, giving us closure.  So $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt 2)$ is a field. Now we seek to replicate this with $\\sqrt[3] 5$. A little bit of algebra will quickly show that if we define $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]5)$ with elements $a + b\\sqrt[3]5$ as before, we'll run into problems with closure when multiplying two such elements.  Instead we define $$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]5) = \\{a + b\\sqrt[3]5 + c\\sqrt[3]{25} \\;|\\; a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$$ Once again, checking that the above set is an additive abelian group is easy. To show that the set minus $0$ is a multiplicative group we need to do some linear algebra: We want to show that given $a,b$ and $c$ (not all three $0$) there exists a unique $x,y$ and $z$ such that $$(a + b\\sqrt[3]5 + c\\sqrt[3]{25})(x + y\\sqrt[3]5 + z\\sqrt[3]{25}) = (1 + 0\\sqrt[3]5 + 0\\sqrt[3]{25})$$ where the right-hand side of the above equation is just $1$, namely the multiplicative identity.  Some tedious algebra allows us to rewrite the left-hand side as \n$$(ax + 5cy + 5bz) + (bx + ay + 5cz)\\sqrt[3]{5} + (cx + by + az)\\sqrt[3]{25} = 1$$\nSo we can rewrite the above as a system of equations ${\\bf A x = b}$ given by\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}a & 5c & 5b \\\\ b & a & 5c \\\\ c & b & a\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ z\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis reduces the problem of showing that there always exists a unique multiplicative inverse to one of showing that the above square matrix is invertible (which would guarantee us a unique solution.)  So let's find its determinant: $$\\det({\\bf A}) = a(a^2 - 5bc) + b(5b^2 - 5ac) + c(25c^2 - 5ab) = a^3 + 5b^3 + 25c^3 - 15abc.$$ Finally, we get to where I'm stuck.  How can we guarantee that the above is always non-zero as long as $a,b$ and $c$ are not all zero?  The notes I'm going over skipped this part and just said that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{5})$ is a field.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If we really want to do it more or less in the way that you describe, it can be done. What we want to show is that \n$$a^3 + 5b^3 + 25c^3 - 15abc=0$$\nhas no non-zero rational solutions.  If we do not insist on rationality, of course there are many solutions. Suppose to the contrary there is such a solution. Express $a$, $b$, and $c$ using a common denominator $d$, and multiply by $d^3$.  We end up looking for integer solutions of the above equation. Note that $5$ divides all the coefficients except the one for $a^3$. So $5$ must divide $a$, say $a=5a_1$. Substitute.  Divide through by $5$. We find that $5$ now divides all the coefficients except the one for $b^3$. So $5$ divides $b$, say $b=5b_1$. Substitute, divide by $5$. Now we are in the same situation with $c^3$. Let $c=5c_1$, divide through by $5$. We conclude that if $(a,b,c)$ is an integer solution, so is $(a_1,b_1,c_1)$. \nNow we can play the same game with $(a_1,b_1,c_1)$. And with $(a_2,b_2,c_2)$. And so on, forever. This is impossible unless $(a,b,c)=(0,0,0)$, for \nthe only integer divisible by arbitrarily high powers of $5$ is $0$. Note that we have used the classic descent argument for proving irrationality. Remark: For polynomials that are only a little more complicated than $x^3-5$, imitating your computation and the subsequent descent argument sounds very unpleasant. But the Bezout Theorem approach so nicely described by Arturo Magidin gives a uniform proof for all polynomials irreducible over the rationals.  Moreover, the Bezout process uses a simple algorithm, essentially the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which efficiently produces your desired $(x,y,z)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and extract the assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe original problem is about showing that the set Q(³√5) = {a + b³√5 + c³√25 | a,b,c ∈ Q} is a field. The user goes through the process of checking the additive group, then the multiplicative group by finding inverses. They set up a system of equations using linear algebra to find the inverse, leading to a matrix whose determinant needs to be non-zero for the inverse to exist. The determinant is calculated as a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc, and the question is how to prove this determinant is non-zero when a, b, c are not all zero.\n\nSo the assumptions here are the definitions and conditions given in the problem. The key assumptions would be about the structure of the field extension, the form of the elements, and the properties they need to verify. Let me list each assumption one by one, each on its own line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst, the field extension is defined as Q(³√5) with elements a + b³√5 + c³√25 where a, b, c are rationals. Then, they need to check that the set is an additive abelian group, which is stated to be easy. The main problem is showing the multiplicative inverses exist, which reduces to showing the determinant of matrix A is non-zero when a, b, c are not all zero. The determinant expression is given, so the critical assumption is that a, b, c are not all zero (i.e., the element is non-zero). The problem then is to prove that the determinant is non-zero under that condition, ensuring the matrix is invertible, hence inverses exist.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- Elements of Q(³√5) are of the form a + b³√5 + c³√25 with a, b, c ∈ Q.\n- The additive structure is an abelian group.\n- The multiplicative inverse requires solving the matrix equation Ax = [1, 0, 0]^T.\n- The determinant of matrix A is a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc.\n- The coefficients a, b, c are not all zero.\n\nWait, but the problem is specifically about proving that the determinant is non-zero when a, b, c are not all zero. So the assumptions leading to that part are the structure of the field extension and the setup for the inverse. The main problem is proving the determinant is non-zero, which in turn shows the inverse exists, hence Q(³√5) is a field.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions should capture the necessary conditions for the determinant part. The key points are:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Let a, b, c be rational numbers.\n- Not all of a, b, c are zero.\n- The determinant of the matrix A is a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc ≠ 0 when a, b, c are rational numbers not all zero.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is more about showing that Q(³√5) is a field by verifying the multiplicative inverses, which reduces to proving the determinant is non-zero. So the problem statement in the formatted version should reflect that.\n\nBut according to the example given, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" Here, the core problem is to prove that the determinant is non-zero under certain conditions. However, the user's example included the original problem's statement but adjusted the assumptions. The original problem in the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, that assumption was listed, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is about showing that Q(³√5) is a field by ensuring inverses exist, which depends on the determinant being non-zero. So the formatted problem would be the core question after filtering out the setup: proving that the determinant is non-zero when a, b, c are not all zero. Alternatively, the problem could be to show that Q(³√5) is a field by proving the existence of multiplicative inverses, which depends on the determinant. However, the user's example extracted the key mathematical problem from the original question.\n\nLooking at the user's example, they took the original problem which had an assumption that n is an integer (and possibly another assumption about divisibility by 7, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was split into two lines: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSimilarly, here, the original problem is about showing Q(³√5) is a field. The key step left is proving that the determinant a³ +5b³ +25c³ -15abc ≠0 when a,b,c not all zero. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- a, b, c are rational numbers.\n- At least one of a, b, c is non-zero.\n- The determinant of the matrix A is a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc.\n\nProblem: Prove that a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc ≠ 0.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is more about showing the field structure, but the user's specific question is about the determinant, then the problem would be phrased accordingly. Since the user's last sentence says \"How can we guarantee that the above is always non-zero as long as a,b and c are not all zero?\" So the actual problem is to prove that determinant ≠0 under those conditions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should list the assumptions leading up to that specific question and then state the problem as proving the determinant is non-zero.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Let a, b, c ∈ ℚ (rational numbers).\n- Not all of a, b, c are zero.\n- The determinant of the matrix A is given by a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc.\n\nProblem: Prove that a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc ≠ 0.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Wait, the determinant is a³ +5b³ +25c³ -15abc. The problem is to show that this determinant is non-zero whenever a, b, c are not all zero. So the assumptions should include that a, b, c are in ℚ, and not all zero, and the determinant is as given. The problem is to prove that determinant is non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the field is over ℚ, so the coefficients a, b, c are in ℚ. The determinant's expression is given. So yes, the key assumptions are a, b, c are rationals, not all zero, and the determinant is that expression. Then the problem is to prove it's non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are elements of ℚ,\nAt least one of a, b, c is non-zero,\nThe determinant of the matrix A is a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc ≠ 0.\n\nBut maybe another way. The original problem's main goal is to show that ℚ(³√5) is a field by verifying multiplicative inverses. The step needed is to show that the determinant is non-zero, which is the crux. So the problem as structured should reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the user rephrased the original problem's main statement into the problem part. Here, the original problem is about showing ℚ(³√5) is a field. But the specific question the user is stuck on is about the determinant. However, according to the user's instructions, they want to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem. So the problem should be the main question after removing the setup.\n\nBut perhaps in the original post, the user is asking how to show that the determinant is non-zero. Therefore, the formatted problem should be about proving that determinant is non-zero given the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should list the assumptions related to that specific problem (the determinant part) and then state the problem as proving the determinant is non-zero.\n\nSo the correct format would be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are rational numbers,\nAt least one of a, b, c is non-zero,\nThe determinant of matrix A is a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a³ + 5b³ + 25c³ - 15abc ≠ 0.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to mention the matrix A explicitly, but perhaps that's part of the problem's context. However, according to the example, the original problem's expression was kept in the problem statement. In the example, the formatted problem included the expression A(n) with the same structure. So here, the problem should mention the determinant expression. But maybe more precisely, the problem is to show that the determinant is non-zero for the given matrix when a, b, c are not all zero. However, the determinant expression is already given as a³ +5b³ +25c³ -15abc. So the problem is to prove that this expression is non-zero under the conditions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have the assumptions as:\n\n- a, b, c ∈ ℚ,\n- At least one of a, b, c is non-zero,\n- The determinant of the matrix A is a³ +5b³ +25c³ -15abc.\n\nProblem: Prove that a³ +5b³ +25c³ -15abc ≠ 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the matrix is part of the problem's setup, but according to the example, the problem is phrased directly. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that the determinant a³ +5b³ +25c³ -15abc is non-zero for all rational numbers a, b, c not all zero.\n\nBut the exact wording should follow the example's style. The example had:\n\nProblem: Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\n\nSimilarly, here, the problem is to prove that [expression] is non-zero under certain conditions. Hence, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are rational numbers,\nAt least one of a, b, c is non-zero,\nThe determinant of the matrix A is given by a³ +5b³ +25c³ -15abc.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a³ +5b³ +25c³ -15abc ≠ 0.\n\nThat should be the structured problem.",
