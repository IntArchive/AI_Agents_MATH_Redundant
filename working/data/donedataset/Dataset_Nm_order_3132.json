    "Content": "Let $f = x^5+2x^4-2$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb C$ with $f(\\alpha) = 0$. Show that $\\mathbb Z [\\alpha ]$ is a principal ideal ring. What I have done so far: My idea was to first prove that $\\mathcal O_K = \\mathbb Z[\\alpha ]$ (with $K := \\mathbb Q[\\alpha]$) and after that show that the class number $h_K = 1$. This would imply the claim.\nSo I calculated the discriminant: $$d\\left(\\mathbb Z[\\alpha ]\\right) = D(f) = -15536 = (-1)\\cdot 2^4 \\cdot 971$$\nFrom this I can derive $\\mathcal O_K = \\mathbb Z[\\alpha ]$ (Since $f$ is an Eisenstein-polynomial for $p=2$ we know that $2 \\nmid \\left[ \\mathcal O_K : \\mathbb Z [\\alpha] \\right]$, but $[ \\mathcal O_K : \\mathbb Z [\\alpha] ]^2 \\cdot d(\\mathcal O_K)= d(\\mathbb Z[\\alpha ]) = (-1)\\cdot 2^4 \\cdot 971$. Therefore $[ \\mathcal O_K : \\mathbb Z [\\alpha] ]= 1$ and $\\mathcal O_K = \\mathbb Z[\\alpha ]$) However I am having problems showing $h_K = 1$. I have calculated the Minkowski bound $M$. It is $M<7$. So I only need to look at the prime ideals above $2,3$ and $5$ and show that they are principal already (right?). But how do I do that exactly, I am not sure how to tell whether they are split, inert or ramified. Any help would be much appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Use $f$ to find the factorization of a prime $p$ in the given ring. We have that: $$f = x^5 \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[x] \\implies 2\\mathcal{O}_K = (2,\\alpha)^5 = \\mathfrak{p}_2^5$$\n$$f = x^5+2x^4+1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_3[x] \\implies 3\\mathcal{O}_K = (3)$$\n$$f = x^5+2x^4+3 \\in \\mathbb{F}_5[x] \\implies 5\\mathcal{O}_K = (5)$$ (The polynomials on the left are written in their factorization into irreducibles) So from here we have that the problem reduces to proving that $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2,\\alpha)$ is a principal ideal. But this is true, as $2=\\alpha(\\alpha^4 + 2\\alpha^3)$ and so $2 \\in (\\alpha)$. Hence we have that $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\alpha)$. Hence as the class group of the ring of integers is generated by principal ideals we have that $h_K =1$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that ℤ[α] is a principal ideal ring, where α is a root of the polynomial f(x) = x⁵ + 2x⁴ - 2. They mentioned using the class number approach, so first confirming that the ring of integers 𝒪_K is indeed ℤ[α], then showing the class number h_K is 1.\n\nFrom the discriminant calculation, they found that the discriminant of ℤ[α] is -15536, which factors into -1·2⁴·971. They used Eisenstein's criterion with p=2, which tells us that 2 doesn't divide the index [𝒪_K : ℤ[α]]. Since the discriminant of ℤ[α] is equal to [𝒪_K : ℤ[α]]² times the discriminant of 𝒪_K, and here the index must be 1. So 𝒪_K = ℤ[α]. That part is already done.\n\nNow, the main task is proving h_K = 1. The Minkowski bound is less than 7, so they need to check prime ideals above 2, 3, and 5. Each prime number (2, 3, 5) in ℤ will factor into prime ideals in 𝒪_K. The user is unsure how to determine if these primes split, ramify, or stay inert, and then how to show the resulting ideals are principal.\n\nFirst, for each prime p (2,3,5), we need to factor the ideal p𝒪_K into prime ideals. Since f is Eisenstein at p=2, the prime 2 ramifies in 𝒪_K. Specifically, since f is Eisenstein for p=2, the ideal (2) factors as (2, α)² or something similar, but for degree 5, maybe (2) = 𝔭⁵? Wait, Eisenstein implies that (2) = 𝔭^5 where 𝔭 is a prime ideal of norm 2. Wait, no. Eisenstein's criterion for p=2 tells us that (2) is totally ramified, so the prime ideal above 2 is principal if generated by α or some element related to α. Since the minimal polynomial is x⁵ + 2x⁴ - 2, then modulo 2, f(x) ≡ x⁵ (mod 2), so (2) = (2, α)^5. But since α⁵ ≡ -2α⁴ + 2 (mod 2), which is 0 mod 2, so maybe (2) = (α)^something? Hmm, maybe 𝔭 = (2, α). But we need to check if this ideal is principal.\n\nFor primes 3 and 5, which don't divide the discriminant (since discriminant is -2⁴·971, so 3 and 5 don't divide it). Wait, the discriminant of the field is d(𝒪_K) = -15536, which factors into primes 2, 971. Therefore, primes 3 and 5 are unramified. To factor (3) and (5), we can look at the factorization of f mod 3 and mod 5.\n\nFor p=3: Factor f(x) modulo 3. f(x) = x⁵ + 2x⁴ - 2. Modulo 3, this is x⁵ + 2x⁴ + 1. Let's check if it factors. Testing x=0: 0 + 0 +1=1≠0. x=1: 1 + 2 +1=4≡1≠0. x=2: 32 + 2*16 -2, but modulo 3, x=2: 2⁵ +2*2⁴ +1 = 32 + 2*16 +1 ≡ 2 + 2*1 +1 = 2+2+1=5≡2≠0. So f is irreducible modulo 3? If f is irreducible mod 3, then (3) is a prime ideal in 𝒪_K, hence principal (since (3) itself is principal). If it's irreducible, then (3) remains prime, so it's principal. If it factors, then we need to check the factors.\n\nWait, but maybe f factors modulo 3. Let me check again. Maybe there's a quadratic factor. Let's see, f mod3 = x⁵ + 2x⁴ +1. Maybe try to factor into x^k + ... Let me try possible roots again. Wait, maybe there's a repeated root? The derivative f’(x) = 5x⁴ + 8x³. Modulo 3, that's 2x⁴ + 2x³. Setting this equal to 0: 2x³(x +1) ≡0 mod3. So possible multiple roots at x=0 or x=2 (since x+1=0 →x=2). But f(0)=1≠0, f(2)=2⁵ +2*2⁴ +1 =32 +32 +1=65≡2≠0 mod3. So f is square-free mod3. Therefore, if it factors, it's into distinct factors. Since it's degree 5, maybe it factors into linear and quadratic, etc. But since no roots, maybe it factors into a quadratic and a cubic. Let's attempt to factor. Suppose x⁵ +2x⁴ +1 = (x² + ax + b)(x³ + cx² + dx + e). Multiply out:\n\nx²*x³ = x⁵\n\nCoefficient of x⁴: a + c = 2\n\nCoefficient of x³: b + a c + d =0\n\nCoefficient of x²: a d + b c + e =0\n\nCoefficient of x: b d + a e =0\n\nConstant term: b e =1.\n\nSince mod3, b e=1, so possible b=1, e=1 or b=2, e=2. Let's try b=1, e=1.\n\nThen from x term: b d + a e = d + a =0 →d = -a.\n\nFrom x² term: a d + c + e = a*(-a) + c +1 = -a² + c +1 =0 →c = a² -1.\n\nFrom x³ term: b + a c + d =1 + a c + (-a) =1 +a(c -1) =1 +a(a² -1 -1) =1 +a(a² -2). Let's substitute c =a² -1.\n\nWait, original x³ coefficient: 1 + a c + d = 1 + a(a² -1) + (-a) =1 + a³ -a -a =1 +a³ -2a.\n\nSet this equal to 0 mod3: 1 +a³ -2a ≡0 mod3.\n\nTest a=0: 1 +0 -0=1≡1≠0.\n\na=1: 1 +1 -2=0→0 mod3. Okay, so a=1.\n\nSo c =a² -1=1 -1=0.\n\nThen d= -a= -1=2 mod3.\n\nFrom x⁴ term: a + c=1 +0=1≡1, but we need it to be 2. Contradiction. So this doesn't work.\n\nTry a=2:\n\nCompute 1 +a³ -2a =1 +8 -4=5≡2≠0 mod3. Not zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe b=2, e=2. Then constant term 2*2=4≡1 mod3. So b=2, e=2.\n\nFrom x term: b d +a e =2d +2a ≡0 mod3. Multiply both sides by 2 inverse, which is 2: 4d +4a ≡d +a ≡0 mod3. So d ≡ -a mod3.\n\nFrom x² term: a d +c +e =a*(-a) +c +2 ≡ -a² +c +2 ≡0 mod3 →c ≡a² -2 mod3.\n\nFrom x³ term: b +a c +d =2 +a c + (-a) ≡2 +a(c) -a ≡2 +a(c -1) mod3.\n\nSubstitute c =a² -2:\n\n2 +a(a² -2 -1) =2 +a(a² -3) ≡2 +a(a²) mod3 (since -3≡0). So 2 +a³ ≡0 mod3.\n\nSo 2 +a³ ≡0 →a³≡1 mod3.\n\nPossible a=1: 1≡1→yes. a=2:8≡2≡2≠1. So a=1.\n\nThus, a=1, c=1² -2=1-2=-1≡2 mod3.\n\nd=-a= -1≡2 mod3.\n\nCheck x⁴ term: a +c=1 +2=3≡0 mod3, but we need x⁴ coefficient to be 2. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, no such factorization. Hence, f is irreducible mod3. Therefore, (3) remains prime in 𝒪_K, so (3) is a principal ideal (since it's generated by 3), hence principal.\n\nSimilarly for p=5: Factor f(x)=x⁵ +2x⁴ -2 modulo5. Let's compute f mod5: x⁵ +2x⁴ +3. Check for roots: x=0: 0 +0 +3=3≠0. x=1:1 +2 +3=6≡1≠0. x=2:32 +2*16 +3=32+32+3=67≡67-65=2≠0. x=3:243 +2*81 +3=243+162+3=408≡408-400=8≡3≠0. x=4:1024 +2*256 +3=1024+512+3=1539≡1539-1530=9≡4≠0. So no linear factors. Check if it factors into a quadratic and cubic. Let's suppose f(x)≡(x² +ax +b)(x³ +cx² +dx +e) mod5.\n\nMultiplying out:\n\nx²*x³ =x⁵.\n\nCoefficient of x⁴:a +c =2.\n\nCoefficient of x³: b +a c +d =0.\n\nCoefficient of x²: a d +b c +e =0.\n\nCoefficient of x: b d +a e =0.\n\nConstant term: b e =3.\n\nPossible b and e such that b e ≡3 mod5. Possibilities: (b,e)=(1,3),(2,4),(3,1),(4,2). Let's try b=1,e=3.\n\nThen from x term:1*d +a*3≡0 →d ≡-3a mod5.\n\nFrom x² term: a*d +1*c +3≡a*(-3a) +c +3 ≡-3a² +c +3 ≡0 →c ≡3a² -3 mod5.\n\nFrom x³ term:1 +a c +d ≡1 +a*(3a² -3) + (-3a) ≡1 +3a³ -3a -3a ≡1 +3a³ -6a ≡1 +3a³ -a mod5.\n\nSet this equal to 0: 1 +3a³ -a ≡0 mod5.\n\nTest a=0:1 +0 -0=1≠0.\n\na=1:1 +3 -1=3≡3≠0.\n\na=2:1 +24 -2=23≡3≠0.\n\na=3:1 +81 -3=79≡4≠0.\n\na=4:1 +192 -4=189≡189-185=4≠0.\n\nNo solution. Try b=2,e=4.\n\nFrom x term:2d +4a ≡0 mod5 →2d ≡ -4a →d ≡-2a mod5.\n\nFrom x² term: a*d +2c +4 ≡a*(-2a) +2c +4 ≡-2a² +2c +4 ≡0 mod5 →2c ≡2a² -4 →c ≡a² -2 mod5.\n\nFrom x³ term:2 +a c +d ≡2 +a*(a² -2) + (-2a) ≡2 +a³ -2a -2a ≡2 +a³ -4a ≡0 mod5.\n\nSo 2 +a³ -4a ≡0 →a³ -4a +2≡0 mod5.\n\nTest a=0:0 -0 +2=2≠0.\n\na=1:1 -4 +2=-1≡4≠0.\n\na=2:8 -8 +2=2≡2≠0.\n\na=3:27 -12 +2=17≡2≠0.\n\na=4:64 -16 +2=50≡0 mod5. Yes! a=4.\n\nThus, a=4, c=4² -2=16-2=14≡4 mod5.\n\nd=-2*4= -8≡2 mod5.\n\nCheck x⁴ term: a +c=4 +4=8≡3≡2 mod5? No, 8≡3, but need 2. So contradiction. So this doesn't work.\n\nNext, try b=3,e=1.\n\nFrom x term:3d +1*a≡0 →3d ≡-a →d ≡-a*2 mod5 (since inverse of 3 is 2).\n\nFrom x² term: a*d +3c +1 ≡a*(-2a) +3c +1 ≡-2a² +3c +1 ≡0 →3c ≡2a² -1 →c ≡ (2a² -1)*2 mod5 (since inverse of3 is2).\n\nc ≡4a² -2 mod5.\n\nFrom x³ term:3 +a c +d ≡3 +a*(4a² -2) + (-2a) ≡3 +4a³ -2a -2a ≡3 +4a³ -4a ≡0 mod5.\n\nSo 4a³ -4a +3 ≡0 mod5.\n\nMultiply both sides by inverse of4, which is4: (16a³ -16a +12)≡ (a³ -a +2)≡0 mod5.\n\nTest a=0:0 -0 +2=2≠0.\n\na=1:1 -1 +2=2≠0.\n\na=2:8 -2 +2=8≡3≠0.\n\na=3:27 -3 +2=26≡1≠0.\n\na=4:64 -4 +2=62≡2≠0.\n\nNo solution. Next, try b=4,e=2.\n\nFrom x term:4d +2a ≡0 mod5 →4d ≡-2a →d ≡-2a*4^{-1}≡-2a*(-1)≡2a mod5 (since 4^{-1}=4 mod5).\n\nFrom x² term: a*d +4c +2 ≡a*(2a) +4c +2 ≡2a² +4c +2 ≡0 mod5 →4c ≡-2a² -2 →c ≡ (-2a² -2)*4^{-1}≡ (-2a² -2)*4 ≡ (-8a² -8)≡2a² +2 mod5.\n\nFrom x³ term:4 +a c +d ≡4 +a*(2a² +2) +2a ≡4 +2a³ +2a +2a ≡4 +2a³ +4a ≡0 mod5.\n\nSo 2a³ +4a +4 ≡0 mod5. Multiply by inverse of2, which is3: 6a³ +12a +12 ≡a³ +2a +2≡0 mod5.\n\nTest a=0:0 +0 +2=2≠0.\n\na=1:1 +2 +2=5≡0→Yes.\n\nThus, a=1. Then c=2*1² +2=4 mod5.\n\nd=2*1=2 mod5.\n\nCheck x⁴ term: a +c=1 +4=5≡0≡2 mod5? No, 0≡0, but we need x⁴ coefficient to be2. So contradiction. Hence, no factorization.\n\nTherefore, f is irreducible mod5. Hence, (5) remains prime in 𝒪_K, hence principal.\n\nNow for p=2, which is ramified. Since f is Eisenstein at p=2, the ideal (2) factors as 𝔭^5, where 𝔭 is a prime ideal of norm 2. To check if 𝔭 is principal. Since 𝔭^5=(2), if 𝔭 is principal, say 𝔭=(β), then (β)^5=(2), so β^5=2*u for some unit u. If 𝔭 is generated by α, then maybe (α) is related to (2). Wait, but f(α)=0 ⇒α⁵= -2α⁴ +2. So α⁵=2(1 -α⁴). So maybe (α) divides (2). Let's check. Since α⁵=2(1 -α⁴), so α divides 2 in 𝒪_K. Therefore, the ideal (α) divides (2). But since (2) is 𝔭^5, then (α) is a power of 𝔭. But since α is in 𝔭 (as α divides 2), and since 𝒪_K/𝔭 has order 2, the norm of 𝔭 is 2. The norm of (α) is |N(α)|. The constant term of f is -2, so N(α)=±2. Assuming it's irreducible, the norm is 2 (since the constant term is -2, so absolute norm 2). Thus, (α) has norm 2, which must be 𝔭. Hence, 𝔭=(α) is principal. Therefore, (2)= (α)^5, so all prime ideals above 2 are principal.\n\nTherefore, all prime ideals with norm less than Minkowski bound 7 are principal, hence the class number is 1.\n\nSo the key assumptions are about the discriminant, Minkowski bound, and primes to check.",
