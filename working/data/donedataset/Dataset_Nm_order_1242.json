    "Content": "In this question , The Chaz asks whether $G\\times G\\cong H\\times H$ implies that $G\\cong H$, where $G$ and $H$ are finite abelian groups. The answer is to his question is yes, by the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, as noted in the answer by Anjan Gupta. Even though I don't know the first thing about categories -- except for the things that I do know -- I'm wondering if and how such property could be expressed and proven in terms of universal properties, without actually manoevring inside the objects. For instance one may attempt to create a morphism $G\\to H$ somehow appealing to the universal property of $\\oplus$, and subsequently show this morphism is an isomorphism by chasing diagrams. But it seems likely that the existence of a structure theorem of some sort will be required. This question may be considered trivial or weird for someone who's fluent with categories, I don't know. This topic contains quite a few references. I haven't really worked through any of them (yet) but I couldn't find anything helpful at first sight. -- edit, So a more precise title would have been \"Under what conditions that can be expressed in a universal way does $G\\oplus G\\cong H\\oplus H$ imply $G\\cong H$ ?\" but I don't like long titles. -- edit2, By the comment by Alexei Averchenko, maybe It's more natural to ask this question with the product instead of the coproduct. An answer to my question with the 'real' product would be appreciated too, obviously.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Even in the category of all abelian groups, $G\\oplus G\\cong H\\oplus H$ does not imply $G\\cong H$ : there are countably generated torsion-free abelian groups $G$ such that $G\\not\\cong G\\oplus G$ , but $G\\cong G\\oplus G\\oplus G$ . Setting $H=G\\oplus G$ gives an example where the implication does not hold. (The first examples were constructed by A.L.S. Corner, On a conjecture of Pierce concerning direct decompositions of abelian groups , Proc. Colloq. Abelian Groups (Tihany, 1963), Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1964, pp. 43-48; he proves that for any positive integer $r$ there exists a countable torsion-free abelian group $G$ such that the direct sum of $m$ copies of $G$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of $n$ copies of $G$ if and only if $m\\equiv n\\pmod{r}$ .) Of course, the analogous result for direct products fails for groups, though it holds for groups having both chain conditions (by the Krull-Schmidt theorem). The fact that you have categories with arbitrary coproducts/products (like the category of all groups and the category of all abelian groups) in which the result fails means that no proof via universal properties alone can exist. A proof that depended only the universal properties would translate into any category in which products/coproducts exist, but the result is false in general even for very nice categories. Whether the conditions for the implication to hold can be expressed via universal conditions also seems to me to be doubtful. Universal conditions don't lend themselves easily to statements of the form \"If something happens for $A$ and $B$ , then it happens for $f(A)$ and $f(B)$ \" (where by \" $f(-)$ \" I just mean \"this other object cooked up or related to $A$ in some way\") unless the construction/relation happens to be categorical.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the main problem statement. \n\nThe original question is about whether $G \\oplus G \\cong H \\oplus H$ implies $G \\cong H$ for finite abelian groups. The example provided in the user's example shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the question, the key points are:\n1. G and H are finite abelian groups.\n2. The direct sum (or product, as per the edit) of G with itself is isomorphic to the direct sum of H with itself.\n\nThe problem is whether this isomorphism of direct sums implies that G is isomorphic to H. The original answer mentions the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, which might be an assumption. However, the user wants to express the problem's conditions as assumptions. \n\nWait, the example given by the user had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, the assumptions would be the properties of G and H. The problem statement itself is whether the isomorphism of the direct sums implies G ≅ H.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be that G and H are finite abelian groups. Then the problem is whether G⊕G ≅ H⊕H implies G≅H. \n\nBut in the original question, the answer is yes for finite abelian groups. However, the user is asking under what universal conditions this holds, possibly without using the structure theorem. But the problem statement as per the format should capture the original question's core. The user later edited to mention considering products instead of coproducts, but the main problem is still about the implication of the isomorphism of direct sums/products.\n\nSo, the assumptions are that G and H are finite abelian groups. The problem is to determine if G⊕G ≅ H⊕H implies G ≅ H. \n\nBut wait, the original problem's answer is yes for finite abelian groups. However, the user is asking how this can be proven using universal properties, possibly without the structure theorem. But the problem statement in the format should be the actual mathematical question, not the method of proof. So the main problem is whether the isomorphism of the direct sums implies isomorphism of the groups. The assumptions are that G and H are finite abelian.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So perhaps the assumptions are all the given conditions. In the original problem here, the conditions are that G and H are finite abelian groups, and G⊕G ≅ H⊕H. But the problem is whether this implies G ≅ H. So the problem statement would be \"Does G⊕G ≅ H⊕H imply G ≅ H for finite abelian groups?\" But in the format, the problem is phrased as a statement to prove or determine. However, the example's problem was \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" So here, maybe the problem is \"Prove that G⊕G ≅ H⊕H implies G ≅ H for finite abelian groups.\" But the original question is asking whether this implication holds, so perhaps the problem is \"Determine whether G⊕G ≅ H⊕H implies G ≅ H for finite abelian groups.\" However, the answer is known to be yes, but the user is interested in a categorical proof. But the structured problem should just present the question as is. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n- G is a finite abelian group,\n- H is a finite abelian group,\n- G⊕G is isomorphic to H⊕H.\n\nProblem: Prove that G ≅ H.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the problem's assumption includes the isomorphism of the direct sums, but the problem is to prove G ≅ H. But perhaps the assumptions should only list the conditions on G and H, not the premise of the implication. Wait, the original problem is phrased as \"Does G⊕G ≅ H⊕H imply G ≅ H?\" So the implication is the problem. So the structured problem should be: under the assumptions that G and H are finite abelian groups, does G⊕G ≅ H⊕H imply G ≅ H? But the example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" given that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the problem would be \"Prove that G ≅ H\" given that G and H are finite abelian groups and G⊕G ≅ H⊕H. However, the original question is more about whether the implication holds, not to prove it. But the example's format uses \"Prove that...\". So perhaps in this case, the problem is \"Prove that G⊕G ≅ H⊕H implies G ≅ H for finite abelian groups.\" But the user's original question is phrased as a question: \"Does G⊕G ≅ H⊕H imply G≅H in general?\" but in the context of finite abelian groups. So the problem is to determine whether this implication holds. However, according to the example, the problem statement is a command like \"Prove that...\". The example's problem was to prove divisibility by 91, given n is integer and divisible by 7. So here, the problem would be \"Prove that G ≅ H\" under the assumptions that G and H are finite abelian groups and G⊕G ≅ H⊕H. However, in reality, the answer is yes, so the problem is to prove that implication. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n- G is a finite abelian group,\n- H is a finite abelian group,\n- G⊕G is isomorphic to H⊕H.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is isomorphic to H.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's original question is asking whether the implication holds, then maybe the problem is \"Does G⊕G ≅ H⊕H imply G ≅ H?\" under the assumptions that G and H are finite abelian groups. But the example's format uses \"Prove that...\" So perhaps the problem should be \"Prove that G⊕G ≅ H⊕H implies G ≅ H for finite abelian groups.\"\n\nBut in the original problem on Math SE, the answer is yes, so the problem is to prove that implication. Therefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite abelian group,\nH is a finite abelian group,\nG⊕G is isomorphic to H⊕H.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is isomorphic to H.\n\nBut the original question also mentions the coproduct vs. product. The user edited to say maybe it's more natural with product instead of coproduct. However, the main problem is still about the implication. But in the answer, it's noted that for finite abelian groups, the structure theorem gives the result. So the problem is whether the implication holds under these assumptions. Therefore, the correct structured problem is as above.",
