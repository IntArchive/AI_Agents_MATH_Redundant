    "Content": "Let $R$ be a ring with unity. How can I prove that group of invertible elements of $R$ is never of order $5$? My teacher told me and my colleagues that problem is very hard to solve. I would be glad if someone can provide me even a small hint because, at this point, I have no clue how to attack the problem.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here are a couple of ideas: $-1 \\in R$ is always invertible. If $-1 \\neq 1$, then it follows that $R^*$ should have even order, a contradiction. Therefore, $1=-1$ in ring $R$, so in fact $R$ contains a subfield isomorphic to $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Let $a$ be the generator of $R^*$. Consider the subring $N \\subseteq R$ generated by $1$ and $a$. Then in fact $N \\simeq \\mathbb{F}_2[x] / (f(x))$, where $\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$ is the polynomial ring over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, and $f(x)$ is some polynomial from that ring. Since $a^5=1$, it follows that $f(x)$ divides $x^5+1$. This leaves only finitely many options for $f$, and therefore for $N$. Then you can deal with each case separately and see that in each case $|N^*| \\neq 5$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given problem into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that the group of invertible elements (units) in a ring with unity can never have order 5.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement mentions a ring with unity, so that's one assumption. Then, the group of invertible elements (units) having order 5 is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, but in the example given, the assumption included conditions on n. Here, the problem is to show that such a group can't have order 5, given that R is a ring with unity. So the assumption here is that R is a ring with unity. The problem is to prove that the group of units can't have order 5.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem statement, the user's teacher might have given additional conditions, but the problem here is more general. Let me check the original question again. The user wrote: \"Let R be a ring with unity. How can I prove that group of invertible elements of R is never of order 5?\" So the only explicit assumption here is that R is a ring with unity. The problem is to prove that the group of units (invertible elements) can't have order 5. There might be an implicit assumption that the ring is finite, but the problem as stated doesn't specify that. Wait, but the group of units having order 5 implies that the group is finite. So perhaps the assumption is that R is a ring with unity and the group of units is finite of order 5, but the problem is to show that this is impossible. Wait, no. The problem is to show that there's no ring with unity where the group of units has exactly 5 elements. Therefore, the assumption is that R is a ring with unity, and the problem is that the group of units cannot have order 5. So in the Assumption section, we need to list all the given conditions. The problem is the statement to prove.\n\nSo in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem under assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that example seems to have added an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, let me check. The original example's original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. But the formatted problem in the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should just be that n is an integer. But the formatted example added \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not part of the original problem. So perhaps the user made a mistake there. But regardless, the task is to format the given problem according to the instructions, which might involve filtering out unrelated information. \n\nWait, maybe the example was from a different problem. Let me look again. The example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But the user wants me to follow the format, so perhaps in their example, they intended to restructure the problem, maybe focusing on a specific case where n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the user's question is about the group of units in a ring with unity never having order 5. So the assumption here is that R is a ring with unity. The problem is to prove that the group of invertible elements (units) cannot have order 5. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a ring with unity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the group of invertible elements of R is never of order 5.\n\nWait, but the original question says \"group of invertible elements of R has never order 5\". So the problem is to prove that there's no ring R with unity where the group of units has exactly 5 elements. Therefore, the only assumption is that R is a ring with unity. The problem is to show that the group of units can't have order 5. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- R is a ring.\n- R has a unity element (multiplicative identity).\n- The group of invertible elements (units) of R is considered.\n\nBut the problem is to show that this group cannot have exactly 5 elements. Therefore, the assumptions are just the first two, since the group of units is part of the problem statement. So in the Assumption section, I should list:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a ring,\nR has a unity element.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the group of invertible elements of R cannot have order 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine \"R is a ring with unity\" into one assumption. The example had two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So if the original problem states \"Let R be a ring with unity\", then perhaps the two assumptions are:\n\n- R is a ring,\n- R has a unity element.\n\nBut maybe \"ring with unity\" is considered a single property. However, the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user intended to split compound conditions into separate lines. Therefore, for \"R is a ring with unity\", split into two:\n\n- R is a ring,\n- R has a multiplicative identity (unity).\n\nBut maybe \"ring with unity\" is a standard term and considered one property. Hmm. The problem is to model the assumptions as per the example. Since the example split \"n is an integer\" and another condition, even though the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", the user's example added an extra assumption. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- R is a ring with unity.\n\nBut if we have to split into individual properties, perhaps:\n\n- R is a ring,\n- R contains a multiplicative identity element.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's original statement is \"Let R be a ring with unity\", so that's a single assumption. Then the problem is as stated.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a ring with unity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the group of invertible elements of R cannot have order 5.\n\nAlternatively, if \"ring with unity\" is considered two separate assumptions, then:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a ring,\nR has a unity element.\n\nBut given that \"ring with unity\" is a standard term, it's better to list it as one assumption. However, the example split the conditions, so perhaps the user wants each property on a separate line. Let me check the example again. The original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's conflicting because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the example was incorrect. But the user provided that example, so perhaps they intended that even if the original problem's assumption is general, the formatted version adds specific assumptions. But that seems off. Maybe there was a mistake in the example.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the original problem states: \"Let R be a ring with unity. How can I prove that group of invertible elements of R is never of order 5?\" So the assumption is that R is a ring with unity. The problem is to prove that the group of units can't have order 5.\n\nTherefore, following the example's structure, even if the example might have had an error, for this problem, the correct formatted version would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a ring with unity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the group of invertible elements of R cannot have order 5.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user intended to show that they can filter unrelated information and restructure, even adding missing assumptions. But perhaps the example was an error, and the user wants to follow the original problem's assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, there's no unrelated information to filter. The problem is straightforward: given a ring with unity, show its unit group can't have order 5. So the formatted problem should be as above.",
