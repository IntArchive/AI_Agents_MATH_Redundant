    "AcceptedAnswer": "Define the function sequence $f_n(x):=\\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n$. Then all $f_n$ are differentiable, and you can easily show by using the definition of the derivative that\n$$\nf'_n(x)=f_n(x)\\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^{-1},\n$$\nhence $f_n'(x)\\to e^x$ as $n\\to\\infty$. Moreover, one can show that $f_n$ converges locally uniformly to $e^x$ and hence $f_n'$ converges locally uniformly to $e^x$ as $n\\to\\infty$ (show that $f_n\\leq f_{n+1}$, i.e. $f_n$ is monotonically increasing, and use Dini's theorem). Finally we conclude, that $(e^x)'=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f_n'(x)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f_n(x)=e^x$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user wants to prove that the derivative of e^x, using the definition of the derivative as a limit and the definition of e^x as the limit of (1 + x/n)^n as n approaches infinity, without using L'Hôpital's rule or logarithmic/inverse function tricks. They also mention proving the equivalence of two definitions of e: one as the limit of (1 + 1/n)^n and the other as the real number where the derivative of e^x at x=0 is 1.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The exponential function is defined as e^x = lim_{n→∞} (1 + x/n)^n for all real x.\n2. The derivative of a function f(x) is defined as the limit as Δx approaches 0 of [f(x + Δx) - f(x)] / Δx.\n3. The proof must not use L'Hôpital's rule.\n4. The proof must not use the logarithm function or properties of logarithms.\n5. The proof must not use derivatives of inverse functions.\n6. The variable n in the limit definition of e^x is a natural number (since the user mentioned n ∈ ℕ when considering the binomial theorem).\n\nWait, does the original problem explicitly state that n is a natural number? Let me check. The user says, \"If I assume that n ∈ ℕ I could use binomial theorem but I didn't get much out of it.\" So the original definition of e^x uses n approaching infinity, and the user considered n as a natural number. But the problem statement as given doesn't specify n ∈ ℕ; it's just a limit as n→∞. However, the user's attempt mentions assuming n ∈ ℕ. Should that be an assumption? Hmm. The problem defines e^x as a limit over n→∞, which is typically taken over integers n (i.e., natural numbers), but maybe it's over real numbers. However, in standard definitions, the limit for e^x as (1 + x/n)^n is taken over integers n. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption here. But does the problem specify that? The original problem says \"n→∞\" without specifying, but the user later mentions \"if I assume that n ∈ ℕ\". So perhaps in their problem setup, n is a natural number. So maybe that's an assumption to include.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n- e^x is defined as the limit as n approaches infinity of (1 + x/n)^n for all real x, where n is a natural number.\n- The derivative is defined via the limit of the difference quotient.\n- Excluding L'Hôpital, logarithms, inverse derivatives.\n\nBut the problem states \"using the definition of e^x and derivation above\" which includes the two definitions given. So the key assumptions are those definitions and the restrictions on methods.\n\nSo let me list the assumptions line by line:\n\nAssumption 1: e^x is defined as lim_{n→∞} (1 + x/n)^n for all real x, where n is a natural number (since the user mentioned binomial theorem, which requires integer exponents).\n\nAssumption 2: The derivative of f(x) is defined as lim_{Δx→0} [f(x + Δx) - f(x)] / Δx.\n\nAssumption 3: The proof must not use L'Hôpital's rule.\n\nAssumption 4: The proof must not use logarithms or properties thereof.\n\nAssumption 5: The proof must not use derivatives of inverse functions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem also mentions proving the equivalence of the two definitions of e. So the two definitions are:\n\n1. e = lim_{n→∞} (1 + 1/n)^n\n\n2. e is the real number such that the derivative of e^x at x=0 is 1.\n\nSo perhaps another assumption is that e is defined via either of these two, but the problem is to show their equivalence. However, the user wants to prove that the derivative of e^x is e^x using the given definitions, which would imply the equivalence.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says \"equivalently prove that the two definitions of e are identical.\" So the problem is two-fold: either prove the derivative is e^x using the given definitions, or prove the two definitions of e are equivalent. So maybe the problem is to do either one, which implies the other.\n\nBut the main task is to structure the problem as per the format. So the assumptions should capture the given definitions and constraints.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The function e^x is defined as lim_{n→∞} (1 + x/n)^n for all real x, where n is a natural number.\n2. The derivative of a function f(x) is defined as lim_{Δx→0} [f(x + Δx) - f(x)] / Δx.\n3. The proof does not use L'Hôpital's rule.\n4. The proof does not involve logarithms or their properties.\n5. The proof does not use derivatives of inverse functions.\n6. The number e is defined as either (1) lim_{n→∞} (1 + 1/n)^n or (2) the real number such that d/dx e^x at x=0 is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem is either to prove the derivative of e^x is e^x using those definitions, or to prove the two definitions of e are equivalent. So perhaps the problem is to show the equivalence of the two definitions, given the definitions of e^x and the derivative.\n\nBut the user's original problem statement is:\n\n\"Prove that d/dx e^x = e^x using the definition of e^x and derivation above, without using L'Hôpital's rule or the \"logarithm trick\" and/or the \"inverse function derivative trick\". Or equivalently prove that the following two definitions of $e$ are identical...\"\n\nSo the problem is two-part, but they are equivalent. Therefore, the problem can be structured as either proving the derivative or showing the equivalence. However, the user wants it structured as per the example. In the example, the assumption included the conditions on the variables and the problem was to prove the divisibility.\n\nSo in this case, the assumptions should list the definitions and constraints.\n\nEach assumption should be a single condition on one object.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\n1. e^x is defined as the limit as n approaches infinity of (1 + x/n)^n for all real x. (Object: e^x; condition: its definition)\n2. The derivative of f(x) is defined as the limit of [f(x + Δx) - f(x)] / Δx as Δx approaches 0. (Object: derivative; condition: definition)\n3. The proof does not use L'Hôpital's rule. (Constraint)\n4. The proof does not use logarithms or their properties. (Constraint)\n5. The proof does not use derivatives of inverse functions. (Constraint)\n6. The variable n in the definition of e^x is a natural number. (From the user's mention of binomial theorem and n ∈ ℕ)\n\nAdditionally, if the problem is to show equivalence of the two definitions of e, then:\n\n7. Definition 1 of e: e = lim_{n→∞} (1 + 1/n)^n.\n8. Definition 2 of e: e is the real number such that d/dx e^x at x=0 equals 1.\n\nBut since the original problem mentions both the derivative of e^x and the equivalence of definitions, but the main task is to prove the derivative equals e^x using the given definitions. The equivalence is an alternative problem.\n\nBut according to the user's problem statement, the problem is either to prove the derivative or prove the equivalence. However, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is to prove either derivative equals e^x or equivalence. But the user might prefer combining both into the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, since the user says \"or equivalently prove that the following two definitions...\", maybe the problem is to do either, so the problem statement can include both.\n\nBut the original problem's title is about the derivative of e^x using those definitions, and the equivalence is an alternative. So perhaps the main problem is to prove d/dx e^x = e^x under the given constraints, and the equivalence is a related part.\n\nBut to structure it as per the example, perhaps the problem is to prove that the derivative is e^x, with the assumptions being the definitions and constraints.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The exponential function is defined as e^x = lim_{n→∞} (1 + x/n)^n for all real x.\n- The derivative of a function f(x) is defined as the limit of [f(x + Δx) - f(x)] / Δx as Δx approaches 0.\n- The proof must not use L'Hôpital's rule.\n- The proof must not use logarithms or their properties.\n- The proof must not use derivatives of inverse functions.\n- The variable n in the exponential definition is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that d/dx e^x = e^x using the given definitions of the exponential function and derivative, without using L'Hôpital's rule, logarithms, or inverse function derivatives.\n\nAlternatively, if the equivalence is the main point, but the original problem asks to prove the derivative equals e^x, so perhaps that's the main problem.\n\nBut the user also mentions proving the two definitions of e are identical. So maybe the problem is twofold, but the format requires a single problem statement. However, the example had a single problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem is as stated in the original title: proving the derivative using those definitions without certain methods.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\ne^x is defined as lim_{n→∞} (1 + x/n)^n for all real x,\nthe derivative of f(x) is defined as lim_{Δx→0} [f(x + Δx) - f(x)] / Δx,\nthe proof does not use L'Hôpital's rule,\nthe proof does not use logarithms or their properties,\nthe proof does not use derivatives of inverse functions,\nn in the definition of e^x is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that d/dx e^x = e^x using the given definitions of e^x and the derivative.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property. So list each assumption separately.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\ne^x is defined as lim_{n→∞} (1 + x/n)^n for all real x,\nthe derivative of f(x) is defined as lim_{Δx→0} [f(x + Δx) - f(x)] / Δx,\nthe proof does not use L'Hôpital's rule,\nthe proof does not use logarithms or their properties,\nthe proof does not use derivatives of inverse functions,\nn is a natural number in the limit defining e^x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the derivative of e^x is e^x.\n\nAlternatively, to make the problem more precise as per the original question, which also mentions proving equivalence of the two definitions of e:\n\nBut the original problem says \"or equivalently prove that the following two definitions of e are identical\". So maybe the problem can be phrased as two parts, but the format requires a single problem. However, the example had a single problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the main problem is the derivative, and the equivalence is an alternative. But the user's problem includes both.\n\nWait, looking at the original problem statement:\n\n\"Prove that d/dx e^x = e^x using the definition of e^x and derivation above, without using L'Hôpital's rule or the \" logarithm trick \" and/or the \"inverse function derivative trick\". Or equivalently prove that the following two definitions of e are identical...\"\n\nSo the problem is to do either one. Therefore, in structuring, perhaps the problem is stated as:\n\nProblem: Prove that d/dx e^x = e^x using the given definitions, or equivalently prove that the two definitions of e (as lim_{n→∞}(1+1/n)^n and as the real number where the derivative of e^x at 0 is 1) are identical, without using L'Hôpital's rule, logarithms, or inverse function derivatives.\n\nBut this makes the problem statement longer. However, in the example, the problem was concise. So perhaps the problem is the first part, and the equivalence is an alternative, but the user wants both.\n\nAlternatively, since the two are equivalent, proving one implies the other. So the problem can be stated as proving the derivative equals e^x, with the equivalence being implied.\n\nGiven that, I think the best way is to follow the user's exact problem statement, which is to prove the derivative using the given definitions, without the mentioned methods. The equivalence is an alternative phrasing, but the main task is the derivative.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions listed as each condition, and the problem statement as proving the derivative.\n\nChecking the example again, the assumption listed specific conditions on n (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions include the definitions, the constraints on the proof methods, and the nature of n.\n\nSo each assumption line by line:\n\n1. e^x is defined as lim_{n→∞} (1 + x/n)^n for all real x.\n\n2. The derivative of f(x) is defined as lim_{Δx→0} [f(x + Δx) - f(x)] / Δx.\n\n3. The proof does not use L'Hôpital's rule.\n\n4. The proof does not use logarithms or their properties.\n\n5. The proof does not use derivatives of inverse functions.\n\n6. n is a natural number in the limit defining e^x.\n\nProblem: Prove that d/dx e^x = e^x.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Each assumption is a single condition on one object or a constraint on the proof. The problem is the main statement to prove.",
