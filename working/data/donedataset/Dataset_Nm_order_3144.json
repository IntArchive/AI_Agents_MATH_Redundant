    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the original problem and the example provided.\n\nThe original problem is to prove that the sum from n=1 to infinity of arcsin[(sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n))/(n+1)] is at least π/4. The user provided an edit where they transformed the argument of the arcsine using a suggestion, leading to a telescoping series that sums to π/4. The key here seems to be establishing an inequality between the original series and the telescoping one.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this problem, the assumptions might be different. Let me parse through the problem.\n\nThe main inequality to prove is π/4 ≤ sum_{n=1}^∞ arcsin[(sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n))/(n+1)]. The user's edit shows that they found a way to compare the given series to another telescoping series. The crucial step seems to be that they transformed the argument inside the arcsin to a form that allows telescoping. Specifically, they used the inequality (sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n))/(n+1) ≤ (sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n))/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}, which would make the arcsine of the left side less than or equal to the arcsine of the right side since arcsin is an increasing function. Then, summing the right side gives a telescoping series that sums to π/4. Therefore, the original series is greater than or equal to π/4.\n\nSo the assumptions here would involve the properties of the arcsin function, particularly that it's increasing, which allows the inequality to hold. Also, the transformation using the identity for arcsin(a) - arcsin(b) might rely on certain conditions for a and b. Let me check the identity they used: arcsin[(sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n))/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}] = arcsin(1/sqrt(n+1)) - arcsin(1/sqrt(n+2)). For this identity to hold, the arguments must satisfy the conditions required by the arcsine addition or subtraction formula. Specifically, if we have arcsin(x) - arcsin(y) = arcsin(z), there are certain domain restrictions on x and y. However, in this case, it's presented as a given identity, so perhaps it's a known identity or derived from another method. The key assumption here would be that the argument on the left side indeed allows the identity to hold, which might require that the terms are within the domain of arcsin (i.e., between -1 and 1) and satisfy some relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the problem involves an infinite series, so convergence might be an assumption, but the user's edit shows that the transformed series telescopes to π/4, implying convergence. However, the original problem statement might not explicitly state convergence, but since the sum is being compared to π/4, it's assumed that the series converges.\n\nPutting this together, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. For all n ≥ 1, the argument of arcsin, (sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n))/(n+1), is within the domain of arcsin (i.e., between -1 and 1). Since all terms are positive, we just need to ensure it's ≤1.\n2. arcsin is an increasing function on its domain, allowing the comparison between the terms.\n3. The identity used for transforming the argument into a telescoping series holds for the given expressions.\n4. The infinite series converges so that the inequality can be established.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were more about the conditions on the variables rather than properties of functions. The user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe here, the assumptions are more about the terms in the series. However, the problem as stated doesn't have variables with conditions other than n being a positive integer starting from 1. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem states to prove the inequality for the sum from n=1 to infinity. The edit shows that they transformed the argument into a telescoping series by using an inequality. So the key assumption is that each term in the original series is greater than or equal to the term in the telescoping series. This relies on the argument inside arcsin in the original series being less than or equal to the argument in the transformed series. Let's verify:\n\nOriginal argument: [sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)] / (n+1)\n\nTransformed argument: [sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)] / sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}\n\nWe need to show that [sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)] / (n+1) ≤ [sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)] / sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}\n\nSince sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n) is positive, we can divide both sides by it, leading to 1/(n+1) ≤ 1/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}\n\nMultiply both sides by (n+1)sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} (positive), we get sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} ≤ (n+1)\n\nBut sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} = sqrt{(n+1)^2 + (n+1)} = sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} < sqrt{(n+1.5)^2} = n+1.5 for n ≥1. Wait, but this would mean sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} is actually greater than n+1, since (n+1)(n+2) = n² +3n +2, and (n+1.5)^2 = n² +3n +2.25. So sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} < n+1.5. But comparing to n+1, clearly sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} > n+1 because (n+1)(n+1) = (n+1)^2 < (n+1)(n+2). Therefore, sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} > n+1, so 1/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} < 1/(n+1). Wait, this contradicts the previous inequality. Wait, the user's edit says that they replaced the denominator (n+1) with sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}, which is larger, making the fraction smaller, hence the original argument is larger than the transformed one. But since arcsin is increasing, the original term would be larger, so sum of original terms is larger than sum of transformed terms. But the user's edit says the original sum is greater than or equal to the transformed sum, which telescopes to π/4. Therefore, the key step is that [sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n)]/(n+1) ≥ [sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n)]/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} because denominator is larger in the transformed version. Hence, since arcsin is increasing, the original arcsin term is ≥ the transformed arcsin term, so the sum of original terms is ≥ sum of transformed terms, which is π/4. Therefore, the inequality holds.\n\nSo the main assumption here is that for each n ≥1, [sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n)]/(n+1) ≥ [sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n)]/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}. Which is true because denominator (n+1) ≤ sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} as we saw earlier (since sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} > n+1). Hence, the fraction on the left is larger, so arcsin of left is larger. Therefore, the assumption is that this inequality holds for all n in the series.\n\nAdditionally, the identity used for the telescoping series must hold, which relies on the specific form of the transformed argument. The user states that arcsin [ (sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n) ) / sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} ] = arcsin(1/sqrt(n+1)) - arcsin(1/sqrt(n+2)). This identity needs to be valid. To verify, let's set a = 1/sqrt(n+1) and b = 1/sqrt(n+2). Then, the identity is arcsin( (sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n)) / sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} ) = arcsin(a) - arcsin(b). Let's check if this identity holds.\n\nLet me recall the formula for arcsin(x) - arcsin(y). There's a formula for sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB. If we let A = arcsin(a) and B = arcsin(b), then sin(A - B) = a sqrt(1 - b²) - sqrt(1 - a²) b. If this equals the argument inside the arcsin on the left side, then the identity holds.\n\nCompute the left side: (sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)) / sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}.\n\nCompute sin(A - B) where A = arcsin(1/sqrt(n+1)) and B = arcsin(1/sqrt(n+2)):\n\nsin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB = (1/sqrt(n+1)) * sqrt(1 - 1/(n+2)) - sqrt(1 - 1/(n+1)) * (1/sqrt(n+2)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(1 - 1/(n+2)) = sqrt((n+1)/(n+2)) = sqrt(n+1)/sqrt(n+2).\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1 - 1/(n+1)) = sqrt(n/(n+1)).\n\nThus, sin(A - B) = (1/sqrt(n+1)) * (sqrt(n+1)/sqrt(n+2)) ) - (sqrt(n)/sqrt(n+1)) * (1/sqrt(n+2)) )\n\nSimplify: The first term is 1/sqrt(n+2), the second term is sqrt(n)/(sqrt(n+1) sqrt(n+2)) = sqrt(n)/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}.\n\nTherefore, sin(A - B) = [1 - sqrt(n)/sqrt(n+1)] / sqrt(n+2).\n\nBut the left side of the identity is (sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)) / sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nNumerator: sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n).\n\nDenominator: sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}.\n\nSo the left side is (sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)) / sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}.\n\nCompare to sin(A - B) which is [1 - sqrt(n)/sqrt(n+1)] / sqrt(n+2).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator of sin(A - B) by sqrt(n+1):\n\nNumerator: sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n).\n\nDenominator: sqrt(n+2) * sqrt(n+1).\n\nThus, sin(A - B) = (sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)) / sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}.\n\nWhich matches the left side. Therefore, sin(A - B) = left side. Since both A and B are in the range [0, π/2] because 1/sqrt(n+1) and 1/sqrt(n+2) are between 0 and 1 for n ≥1, then A - B is in (-π/2, π/2). Therefore, arcsin(sin(A - B)) = A - B, provided that A - B is in [-π/2, π/2]. Since A and B are both positive and decreasing as n increases, A - B is positive, and since each term is small, the difference is less than π/2. Hence, arcsin of the left side equals A - B, which is arcsin(1/sqrt(n+1)) - arcsin(1/sqrt(n+2)). Therefore, the identity holds.\n\nThus, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. For all n ≥1, [sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)]/(n+1) ≥ [sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)]/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}.\n2. The identity arcsin x - arcsin y = arcsin(z) holds for specific x and y derived from the problem.\n3. The function arcsin is increasing on its domain.\n4. The series converges so that the telescoping sum evaluates to π/4.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variables (n being integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about an infinite series and properties of arcsin. However, the user's format example extracted variable conditions. So maybe for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The series starts at n=1 and goes to infinity.\n- Each term in the series is of the form arcsin([sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)]/(n+1)).\n- arcsin is an increasing function.\n- The identity used for telescoping holds for all n ≥1.\n- The comparison between the original terms and the telescoping terms is valid.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So translating the key points:\n\n1. For each integer n ≥1, the argument of arcsin, (sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n))/(n+1), is in the domain [-1, 1].\n2. The function arcsin is increasing on its domain.\n3. For each integer n ≥1, [sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)]/(n+1) ≥ [sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n)]/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}.\n4. The identity arcsin[(sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n))/sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}] = arcsin(1/sqrt(n+1)) - arcsin(1/sqrt(n+2)) holds for all n ≥1.\n5. The infinite series ∑_{n=1}^∞ [arcsin(1/sqrt(n+1)) - arcsin(1/sqrt(n+2))] converges to π/4.\n\nThese are the assumptions needed to establish the inequality. Now, the problem statement is to prove that the original sum is at least π/4. So the formatted problem should list these assumptions, but the user might want only the essential ones mentioned in the original problem or necessary for the proof. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. In this case, the original problem doesn't state these assumptions explicitly; they are part of the proof steps. But according to the user's instructions, we need to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem with its assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention the identity or the comparison; those are part of the solution. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions here are implicit in the problem statement.\n\nWait, but the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless there was a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Unless there was a misunderstanding. Maybe the user provided a bad example, but according to their example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps the task is to extract assumptions from the problem statement, but the example shows adding an assumption not present in the original. That seems contradictory. Maybe the user's example is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the formatted problem corrects it by adding the necessary assumption. But I'm not sure. Given this confusion, I need to proceed carefully.\n\nBack to the current problem. The original problem is to prove that π/4 ≤ sum_{n=1}^∞ arcsin[(sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n))/(n+1)]. The user's edit shows that they used an inequality to compare the original series to a telescoping one. The key assumptions needed here are:\n\n- The terms of the series are such that the comparison via arcsin's monotonicity is valid.\n- The identity for the telescoping series holds.\n- The telescoping series converges to π/4.\n\nHowever, according to the user's example, assumptions might be conditions on variables. In this case, the variable is n starting from 1, which is an integer. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (π/4) ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ arcsin[(sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n))/(n+1)].\n\nBut in the user's example, they added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7). That might have been a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem in the example had a typo, and the formatted problem corrected it by adding necessary assumptions. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Given that, for the current problem, the original statement doesn't specify any assumptions other than n being a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1). However, the key step in the solution involves comparing the argument to another expression and using an identity. These steps rely on certain conditions which could be considered assumptions.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions. The original problem's title and question don't mention the identity or the comparison; those are part of the solution. Therefore, the formatted problem should include only the assumptions explicitly given or implicitly necessary from the problem statement. The original problem states the inequality to prove, and the sum is over n starting at 1. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n ≥1.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". This suggests that maybe the user wants to list all necessary conditions for the problem to hold, even if they are not explicitly stated. However, in the current problem, the proof holds for all n ≥1 without additional restrictions. The key is that the original problem's solution uses the comparison and the identity, but those are part of the proof steps, not assumptions of the problem itself.\n\nWait, the example given by the user seems to have a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which contradicts \"for every integer n\". This suggests that perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and the actual problem might have had a missing condition. But given that, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as in the example. The original problem is to prove the inequality for the sum. The key assumptions necessary for the problem to make sense are:\n\n1. The domain of the arcsin function: for each n ≥1, the argument (sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n))/(n+1) must be in [-1, 1].\n2. The series converges so that the sum can be compared to π/4.\n\nHowever, the problem statement doesn't mention these; they are part of the verification needed to solve the problem. But the user wants assumptions listed. Given the example, which included conditions on n even if the original problem said \"for every integer\", perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n ≥1,\n- For each n ≥1, (sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n))/(n+1) is in the domain of arcsin (i.e., ≤1).\n\nBut checking if (sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n))/(n+1) ≤1:\n\nSince sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n) = 1/(sqrt(n+1) + sqrt(n)) by rationalizing the numerator.\n\nTherefore, the argument becomes [1/(sqrt(n+1)+sqrt(n))]/(n+1) = 1/[ (sqrt(n+1)+sqrt(n))(n+1) ].\n\nFor n ≥1, this denominator is much larger than 1, so the argument is much less than 1, hence within the domain of arcsin. Therefore, this is always true, so it's a hidden assumption but technically necessary.\n\nHowever, the example given by the user included an assumption not present in the original problem, which might mean that they expect to list even obvious assumptions. So in this case:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥1,\nFor each n ≥1, 0 ≤ (sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n))/(n+1) ≤1.\n\nBut since this is always true, maybe it's redundant. Alternatively, the key assumptions are the convergence of the series and the properties of arcsin. However, given the user's example, they might expect:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ arcsin[(sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n))/(n+1)] converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that π/4 ≤ [the sum].\n\nBut the problem statement itself is to prove the inequality, which implies that the sum exists (i.e., converges). Therefore, the convergence is an implicit assumption.\n\nGiven the user's example and the potential confusion, I think the safest way is to list the assumptions as:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n ≥1.\n\nBecause those are the conditions on n in the sum. The other conditions (domain of arcsin, convergence) are part of the proof but not explicit assumptions. However, the user's example added an assumption not in the original problem, so perhaps they want to include even implicit ones. But given the confusion in the example, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves an infinite series, an assumption could be that the series converges. But the problem asks to prove an inequality involving the sum, which requires the sum to exist.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that π/4 ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ arcsin[(sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n))/(n+1)].\n\nBut considering the user's example added an assumption not in the original problem, maybe they want to include more. But without clearer guidelines, this is speculative. Given the instructions to \"filter the unrelated information and structure that problem as the following format,\" and the example, perhaps the assumptions are just about the variables involved. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that π/4 ≤ ∑_{n=1}^∞ arcsin[(sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n))/(n+1)].\n\nBut the original problem's title and question don't mention any restrictions on n other than starting from 1, which is standard for sums. Therefore, the assumptions are just that n is an integer ≥1. The other conditions (domain of arcsin, convergence) are part of the problem's proof, not the problem's assumptions.",
