    "Content": "Let $|G|=p^{n}m$, and let $0\\leq k\\leq n$. Then the number of subgroups of $G$ of order $p^k$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $p$. I know Wielandt's proof in the case $k=n$, which is standard, but I dont know how to use that proof to prove this above modification. Clearly the set $S$ on which we should make $G$ act by left multiplication has to be the set of all subsets of size $p^k$ and then we know that $\\displaystyle \\binom{p^{k}r} {p^{k}}$ is congruent to $r \\bmod p$. But somehow using the Orbit-Stabilizer theorem I am unable to prove the above modification. Could someone help me prove the above statement using a modification of Wielandt's proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "None of the versions of Wielandt's proofs of Sylow's Theorem that I have seen assume that $k=n$ . I will cut and paste the proof from some lecture notes I have. Theorem. Let $G$ be a finite group and let $p^\\beta$ divide $|G|$ , where $p$ is prime. Let $k$ be the number of subgroups of $G$ of order $p^\\beta $ .  Then $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} $ . Proof. Let $|G| = p^\\alpha t$ with $p\\nmid t$ , so $\\beta \\le \\alpha$ . Let $\\Omega $ be the set of all subsets of $G$ of order $p^\\beta $ .\nSo $|\\Omega | =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} p^\\alpha t \\\\ p^\\beta \\end{array} \\right)$ . Let $G$ act on $\\Omega $ by right multiplication; i.e. if $S \\in \\Omega$ , then $S^g = Sg = \\{sg \\mid s \\in S\\}$ . Let $\\Gamma$ be an orbit of $G^\\Omega$ .\nIf $T \\in \\Gamma$ and $x\\in T$ then $1\\in Tx^{-1} \\in \\Gamma$ so there is a set $S\\in \\Gamma$ with $1\\in S$ . Consider the stabilizer, ${\\rm Stab} _G(S)$ .\nIf $g\\in {\\rm Stab} _G(S)$ then $Sg=S$ so $1g = g \\in S$ .\nThus ${\\rm Stab} _G(S) \\subseteq S$ . Suppose that ${\\rm Stab} _G(S) = S$ , so $S$ is a subgroup of $G$ .\nThen, by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, $|\\Gamma| = |G|/|{\\rm Stab} _G(S)| = p^{\\alpha }t/p^{\\beta } =\np^{\\alpha -\\beta }t $ and $\\Gamma$ is the set of right cosets of $S$ in $G$ . Thus only one element\nof $\\Gamma $ is a subgroup.\nConversely, if $T$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $p^{\\beta}$ then $T^G$ (the orbit of $G^\\Omega$ containing $T$ ) is the set of\nright cosets of $T$ in $G$ so has length $p^{\\alpha -\\beta }t $ Suppose that ${\\rm Stab} _G(S) \\ne S$ .\nThen $|S| > |{\\rm Stab} _G(S)|$ , so $|\\Gamma | > p^{\\alpha -\\beta }t $ .\nSince $|\\Gamma |$ divides $|G| = p^{\\alpha }t $ we have $p^{\\alpha -\\beta +1}$ divides $|\\Gamma |$ .\nSo by 1) no element of $\\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $G$ in this case. Hence, there are exactly $k$ orbits whose stabilizer has size $p^\\beta $ and these orbits have have length $p^{\\alpha -\\beta }t $ , whereas\nthose orbits whose stabilizer has size less than $p^\\beta $ have length\ndivisible by $p^{\\alpha -\\beta +1} $ . So $|\\Omega | = kp^{\\alpha -\\beta }t + l p^{\\alpha -\\beta +1}  $ for some $l$ ,\nand hence $$|\\Omega |/p^{\\alpha -\\beta } = kt + lp \\equiv kt \\pmod{p}.$$ Since $p \\nmid t$ , there is a unique $u \\in \\{1,\\ldots,p-1\\}$ with $ut \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ , and multiplying by $u$ gives $$k \\equiv |\\Omega |u/p^{\\alpha -\\beta } \\!\\!\\!\\pmod{p} \\equiv\n \\left( \\begin{array}{c} p^\\alpha t \\\\ p^\\beta \\end{array} \\right)u\n/p^{\\alpha -\\beta }\\!\\!\\! \\pmod{p}.$$ It is possible to prove directly that this last expression equals\n1 mod $p$ , but we can avoid that as follows.\nNote that $k \\pmod{p}$ is a function of $|G|$ and $p^\\beta$ only,\nand so it is the same for all groups of order $p^{\\alpha} t$ . So $k\n\\pmod{p}$ can be\ndetermined from $G=C_{p^{\\alpha} t}$ , the cyclic group of order $p^{\\alpha} t$ . Hence $k \\equiv 1  \\pmod{p}$ , since a cyclic group $G$ has a unique\nsubgroup of each order dividing $|G|$ . $\\mathbf{Additional\\ Remark\\!:}$ This last trick of using the fact that the number of subgroups modulo $p$ depends only on $|G|$ is due to Graham Higman.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that for a group G of order pⁿm, where p is a prime and m is coprime to p, the number of subgroups of G of order pᵏ (for 0 ≤ k ≤ n) is congruent to 1 modulo p. They specifically mentioned wanting to modify Wielandt's proof, which is typically used for the case when k = n, i.e., the Sylow p-subgroups. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how Wielandt's proof works for the Sylow case. In that proof, we consider the action of G on the set of all subsets of G of size pⁿ by left multiplication. The key points there are showing that the number of such subsets fixed by a Sylow p-subgroup P is congruent to 1 mod p, and then using the orbit-stabilizer theorem to deduce that the number of Sylow p-subgroups (which are the stabilizers here) is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nNow, the user wants to extend this to subgroups of order pᵏ for any k ≤ n. The approach should be similar but adjusted for the general case. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Define the set S**: Instead of subsets of size pⁿ, we consider subsets of size pᵏ. So S is the set of all subsets of G with exactly pᵏ elements.\n\n2. **Group action**: Let G act on S by left multiplication. The action is defined as g⋅X = {gx | x ∈ X} for g ∈ G and X ∈ S.\n\n3. **Fixed points under a Sylow p-subgroup**: Consider a Sylow p-subgroup P of G. We need to analyze the subsets X ∈ S that are fixed by P, meaning P⋅X = X. For X to be fixed by P, X must be a union of left cosets of P. However, since |X| = pᵏ and |P| = pⁿ, the size of each coset is pⁿ. But pᵏ divides pⁿ (since k ≤ n), so maybe X is a union of cosets of some subgroup of P? Wait, this might not hold directly. Alternatively, perhaps X must be a left coset of a subgroup of order pᵏ. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, in the original Sylow proof, the fixed subsets under P are those that are unions of cosets of P. But since |X| = pⁿ in that case, and |P| = pⁿ, such subsets would be single cosets of P. Hence, the fixed points are exactly the left cosets of P, and there are [G:P] such cosets. But [G:P] is equal to m, which is coprime to p. Then, using the congruence from the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have that the number of Sylow p-subgroups is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nIn the general case, for subsets of size pᵏ, we need to find the number of subsets fixed by P. Let's suppose that X is fixed by P. Then, for each x ∈ X, Px ⊆ X. But since X has size pᵏ and Px has size |P| = pⁿ, which is larger than pᵏ unless k = n. Wait, this seems problematic. Unless k = n, the cosets of P would be too large. So perhaps instead, X is fixed by P if X is a union of cosets of some subgroup Q of P where |Q| = pᵏ. Then each coset of Q has size pᵏ, and the union would form a subset of size pᵏ * t, but we need X to have size exactly pᵏ. Therefore, t must be 1, so X is a single coset of a subgroup Q of order pᵏ. \n\nBut subgroups of P of order pᵏ are exactly what we're trying to count. So if X is a left coset of a subgroup Q of order pᵏ, then X is fixed by Q (since Q acts on itself by left multiplication, so qX = X for q ∈ Q). But we need X to be fixed by the entire Sylow subgroup P. Wait, unless Q is normal in P, but since P is a p-group, all its subgroups are subnormal, but not necessarily normal. Hmm, this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed points under P are the subsets X which are unions of cosets of some subgroup of P. But how does the size match up? Let's suppose that Q is a subgroup of P of order pᵏ. Then a left coset of Q has size pᵏ. If X is a union of such cosets, but since we need |X|=pᵏ, then X must be exactly one coset. Therefore, each fixed subset X under P must be a coset of a subgroup of P of order pᵏ. However, the number of such cosets would be equal to the number of subgroups of P of order pᵏ multiplied by the number of cosets for each subgroup. Wait, but in P, the number of subgroups of order pᵏ is congruent to 1 mod p by Sylow's theorem (since P is a p-group, all subgroups are Sylow p-subgroups of their own order). Wait, but in a p-group, the number of subgroups of a given order is congruent to 1 mod p. That might be a theorem from group theory. So if P is a p-group, then the number of subgroups of order pᵏ in P is ≡1 mod p.\n\nTherefore, if we let S be the set of all subsets of size pᵏ, and consider the action of G on S by left multiplication, then the fixed points by P would correspond to the left cosets of subgroups of P of order pᵏ. Each such subgroup Q has [P:Q] = p^{n -k} cosets in P. But wait, if X is a left coset of Q in G, then X is fixed by Q but not necessarily by all of P unless Q is normal in P. This seems like a problem. Maybe I need to adjust the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should use the same strategy as in Wielandt's proof but modify the set S. Let's recall that in the original proof, S is the set of all subsets of G of size pⁿ. Then, the action of G on S has the property that the number of fixed points of P is congruent to 1 mod p, leading to the conclusion about the number of Sylow p-subgroups. For the general case, we need to use a similar argument but for subsets of size pᵏ.\n\nWait, but the key step in Wielandt's proof is the congruence of binomial coefficients modulo p. Specifically, the number of subsets of size pⁿ of G is congruent to m mod p, where |G| = pⁿm. Then, using the fact that the number of such subsets is congruent modulo p to the number of fixed points under P, which are the Sylow p-subgroups. Then, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the number of Sylow subgroups is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nSo for the general case, let’s compute |S| where S is the set of subsets of size pᵏ. Then |S| = C(pⁿm, pᵏ). The number of fixed points of S under the action of P would need to be calculated. Using the congruence C(pⁿm, pᵏ) ≡ C(m,1) mod p, but wait, actually, Lucas's theorem might be useful here. Lucas's theorem states that C(a, b) ≡ product of C(a_i, b_i) mod p, where a_i and b_i are the digits of a and b in base p. Since pᵏ in base p is 1 followed by k zeros, so C(pⁿm, pᵏ) ≡ m mod p. Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nIf |G| = pⁿm, and we are choosing subsets of size pᵏ. The binomial coefficient C(pⁿm, pᵏ). If we write pⁿm in base p, it would be the digits of m followed by n zeros. Then pᵏ in base p is 1 followed by k zeros. By Lucas's theorem, C(pⁿm, pᵏ) ≡ C(m,0) * C(0,0)^{n - k} ... Hmm, actually, this might not directly apply. Maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, if we take G as the cyclic group of order pⁿm, then the number of subgroups of order pᵏ is 1, which is congruent to 1 mod p. But in general, for non-cyclic groups, we need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to use the same strategy as in the Sylow case. Let’s let G act on S, the set of all subsets of size pᵏ. Then, using the fact that the number of such subsets is congruent modulo p to the number of fixed points under P. Then, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the number of orbits (i.e., the number of fixed points divided by the size of the orbit) would give us information about the number of subgroups.\n\nBut I need to be more precise. Let’s denote S as the set of all subsets of G of size pᵏ. The group G acts on S by left multiplication. Let’s consider the fixed points of this action under a Sylow p-subgroup P. A subset X is fixed by P if PX = X, meaning that for every g ∈ P, gX = X. This implies that X is a union of left cosets of some subgroup of P. But since |X| = pᵏ, each left coset of a subgroup Q ≤ P has size |Q|. Therefore, if X is a union of cosets of Q, then |X| = t|Q|. We need t|Q| = pᵏ. Since Q ≤ P, |Q| is a power of p. So |Q| = p^s for some s ≤ n. Then t must be p^{k - s}. Therefore, if Q has order p^s, then t = p^{k - s}, so k - s must be ≥ 0, i.e., s ≤ k.\n\nBut X must be a single subset of size pᵏ. So if we take Q of order pᵏ, then t = 1, so X is a single coset of Q. However, if Q has order less than pᵏ, then t would need to be multiple cosets. However, since we're considering subsets of G, if X is a union of cosets of Q, then X would be a union of multiple cosets, but each coset is of size p^s. So to get |X| = pᵏ, we need t*p^s = pᵏ, so t = p^{k - s}. Thus, s ≤ k, and t = p^{k - s}. But how does this contribute to the fixed points?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the subsets that are cosets of subgroups of order pᵏ are fixed by their respective subgroups. But we need the subsets fixed by the entire Sylow subgroup P. If X is fixed by P, then P must stabilize X as a set. This implies that X is a union of cosets of some subgroup containing the stabilizer of X. The stabilizer of X in G is the set of g ∈ G such that gX = X. If X is fixed by P, then P is contained in the stabilizer of X. Therefore, the stabilizer of X is a subgroup containing P. But the only subgroup containing P is G itself, since P is a Sylow p-subgroup. Wait, no, G can have multiple Sylow p-subgroups, but P is one of them. The stabilizer of X would be a subgroup H such that HX = X. If P ≤ H, then H has order divisible by pⁿ. But in any case, this line of reasoning is getting too convoluted.\n\nLet me refer back to the original Wielandt's proof. In that case, the number of subsets fixed by P is equal to the number of cosets of P, which is m, and since m ≡ m mod p, and the total number of subsets is C(pⁿm, pⁿ) ≡ m mod p. Then, the fixed point formula says that the number of fixed points ≡ |S| mod p. Therefore, m ≡ m mod p, which is trivial, but the key insight is that the only fixed points are the cosets of P, hence the number of Sylow p-subgroups is ≡1 mod p.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider another approach. Let’s consider that the number of subsets fixed by P is congruent to 1 mod p. If we can show that, then by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the number of subgroups of order pᵏ is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nBut how do we show that the number of fixed subsets under P is congruent to 1 mod p? Let's think combinatorially. For each element X in S fixed by P, X is a union of P-orbits. Since P acts on G by left multiplication, the orbits are the right cosets of P. Wait, no. The orbits of the action of P on G by left multiplication are the right cosets of P, since g and h are in the same orbit if there exists a ∈ P such that ag = h, which means h = ag, so g^{-1}h = a^{-1} ∈ P, hence g and h are in the same right coset of P. Therefore, the orbits of P on G are the right cosets of P, each of size |P| = pⁿ.\n\nBut if X is a subset of G fixed by P, then X must be a union of orbits under the action of P. Since each orbit is a right coset of P, which has size pⁿ. Therefore, X is a union of right cosets of P. But X has size pᵏ. So unless k = n, this is impossible. Because each right coset has size pⁿ, and pᵏ divides pⁿ only if k ≤ n, but the union of t right cosets would have size t*pⁿ. For this to equal pᵏ, we need t*pⁿ = pᵏ, which implies t = p^{k - n}, but since k ≤ n, this would require t = p^{k - n} ≤ p⁰ = 1, but k - n ≤ 0, so t = 1 only if k = n. Otherwise, t would be a fraction, which is impossible. Therefore, when k < n, there are no subsets of size pᵏ that are unions of right cosets of P. Hence, the number of fixed points is zero when k < n. But this contradicts the requirement that the number of fixed points is congruent to 1 mod p. So this approach must be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, my initial assumption that the fixed subsets are unions of right cosets of P is only valid when k = n, which is the Sylow case. For k < n, we need a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Perhaps instead of considering the action of G on subsets of size pᵏ, we should consider the action on the set of all subgroups of order pᵏ. But then the action is by conjugation, and the number of fixed points under P would be the number of subgroups normalized by P. But this might not directly help.\n\nWait, the original Wielandt proof uses the action on subsets, not on subgroups. The key is to use the congruence of the binomial coefficient and relate it to the number of fixed points. So even if the fixed points are zero when k < n, maybe we need to use a different group action or a different set S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the action of G on the set of all chains of subgroups of order pᵏ. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, let me recall that in the case of the Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow p-subgroups is congruent to 1 mod p. For the general case, we need to show that the number of subgroups of order pᵏ is congruent to 1 mod p. This is a generalization of Sylow's theorem, and in fact, in a p-group, the number of subgroups of order pᵏ is indeed congruent to 1 mod p. But here, G is not necessarily a p-group; it's a general group of order pⁿm where p does not divide m.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"the number of subgroups of G of order pᵏ is congruent to 1 modulo p\". Is this always true? For example, take G = S₃, which has order 6 = 2*3. Let p=2, n=1, m=3. Let k=0: number of subgroups of order 1 is 1, which is 1 mod 2. For k=1: number of subgroups of order 2 is 3 (the transpositions), which is 3 ≡ 1 mod 2? Wait, 3 mod 2 is 1, yes. So it works here. Another example: G = C₄ × C₂, order 8 = 2³. The number of subgroups of order 2² =4. In C₄ × C₂, the number of subgroups of order 4 is 3. 3 mod 2 is 1. Yes. So it seems the theorem holds.\n\nBut how to prove it using Wielandt's approach. Let me try again.\n\nLet’s let G act on the set S of all subsets of size pᵏ. The total number of such subsets is C(pⁿm, pᵏ). We need to relate this to the number of subgroups. Consider the action of G on S by left multiplication. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. We need to compute the number of fixed points of P on S.\n\nA subset X ∈ S is fixed by P if PX = X. This means that for every x ∈ X and g ∈ P, gx ∈ X. Hence, X is a union of left P-orbits. The orbits of P acting on G by left multiplication are the right cosets of P, each of size |P| = pⁿ. Therefore, X must be a union of right cosets of P. But as before, the size of X is pᵏ, and each right coset has size pⁿ. Therefore, unless k = n, this is impossible. Therefore, when k < n, there are no fixed points. But this contradicts the requirement. Hence, this approach doesn't work for k < n.\n\nSo maybe the original approach only works for k = n. To handle the general case, perhaps a different action or a different set S is needed. For example, consider the set of all pᵏ-element subsets X of G such that X is a subgroup. But this set is exactly what we're trying to count, so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the action of G on the set of all chains or flags of subgroups. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: Use induction on k. For k=0, there's exactly one subgroup (the trivial group), which is 1 ≡1 mod p. Assume true for k, prove for k+1. But I'm not sure how the induction step would go.\n\nAlternatively, consider the use of the orbit-stabilizer theorem on the set of subgroups. Let G act by conjugation on the set of all subgroups of order pᵏ. The number of conjugates of a subgroup H is [G:N_G(H)]. The size of the orbit is divisible by the p-part of [G:N_G(H)]. But this might not lead directly to the result.\n\nWait, maybe use the original idea but modify the set S. Let S be the set of all subsets of size pᵏ that are subgroups. Then G acts on S by conjugation. The number of fixed points under P would be the number of subgroups normalized by P. But I'm not sure how to count those.\n\nAlternatively, think about the action of P on the set of all subgroups of order pᵏ by conjugation. The number of fixed points under this action is the number of subgroups Q of order pᵏ normalized by P, i.e., P ≤ N_G(Q). Then, using the class equation, the number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 mod p. But this requires that the number of non-fixed points is divisible by p, hence the total number is congruent to the number of fixed points mod p. If we can show that the number of fixed points is 1 mod p, then we're done. But how?\n\nIf Q is a subgroup of order pᵏ normalized by P, then PQ is a subgroup of G, and since P normalizes Q, PQ is a subgroup. The order of PQ is |P||Q| / |P ∩ Q|. Since P and Q are p-groups (Q has order pᵏ), PQ is a p-group. But since P is a Sylow p-subgroup, PQ ≤ P, which implies Q ≤ P. Therefore, the only subgroups of order pᵏ normalized by P are those contained in P. Therefore, the fixed points under the conjugation action of P are exactly the subgroups of order pᵏ contained in P. Since P is a p-group, the number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 mod p by Sylow's theorem applied to P. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of order pᵏ in G is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me elaborate.\n\nLet S be the set of all subgroups of G of order pᵏ. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Consider the action of P on S by conjugation. The fixed points of this action are the subgroups Q ∈ S such that P ≤ N_G(Q), i.e., Q is normalized by P. As above, if Q is normalized by P, then PQ is a subgroup, and since P and Q are p-groups, PQ is a p-group containing P. Since P is a Sylow p-subgroup, PQ = P, hence Q ≤ P. Therefore, the fixed points are exactly the subgroups of order pᵏ contained in P. \n\nNow, since P is a p-group, the number of subgroups of order pᵏ in P is congruent to 1 mod p (this is a theorem in p-group theory). Therefore, the number of fixed points in the conjugation action is ≡1 mod p.\n\nOn the other hand, the total number of orbits (conjugacy classes) is equal to the number of subgroups of order pᵏ divided by the size of their orbits. However, using the class equation for the action of P on S:\n\n|S| ≡ number of fixed points mod p.\n\nBecause each non-fixed orbit has size divisible by p (since the orbit size is [P : Stab_P(Q)], which is a power of p). Since P is a p-group, the stabilizer Stab_P(Q) has index a power of p. If Q is not fixed, then the orbit size is divisible by p. Hence, |S| ≡ number of fixed points mod p. But the number of fixed points is ≡1 mod p, hence |S| ≡1 mod p. Therefore, the number of subgroups of order pᵏ is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nYes, this seems to work. So the key was to consider the conjugation action of a Sylow p-subgroup P on the set S of subgroups of order pᵏ, and then use the class equation to relate the total number to the fixed points, which are the subgroups contained in P, whose count is ≡1 mod p.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are that G is a finite group of order pⁿm, where p is a prime not dividing m, and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The problem is to prove that the number of subgroups of G of order pᵏ is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nBut the original question mentioned using a modification of Wielandt's proof, which uses the action on subsets. However, the above approach uses the conjugation action on subgroups. However, since the user asked to modify Wielandt's proof, which is about acting on subsets, perhaps they want a proof similar to that.\n\nBut in the previous analysis, acting on subsets doesn't seem to work for k < n. However, maybe there's a different way. Let me try again with the subset approach.\n\nLet S be the set of all pᵏ-element subsets of G. G acts on S by left multiplication. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup. We need to count the number of fixed points of P on S. Then, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, |S| ≡ number of fixed points mod p. If we can show that the number of fixed points is ≡1 mod p, then the number of orbits (which corresponds to the number of subgroups?) would be ≡1 mod p. Wait, but how does the number of orbits relate to the number of subgroups?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that each subgroup of order pᵏ is counted in the fixed points. But no, subgroups are subsets, but not all subsets are subgroups. The key might be to show that the number of subsets fixed by P is congruent to the number of subgroups of order pᵏ mod p. Then, since |S| ≡ number of fixed points mod p, and if the number of fixed points ≡ number of subgroups mod p, then |S| ≡ number of subgroups mod p. If we can compute |S| mod p, then we can find the number of subgroups mod p.\n\nBut how to compute |S| mod p. Using Lucas's theorem, as mentioned earlier. Let’s see:\n\n|S| = C(pⁿm, pᵏ). To compute this modulo p, we can use Lucas's theorem. Lucas's theorem states that for non-negative integers n and k, and a prime p, if n and k are written in base p as n = n₀ + n₁p + ... + n_tp^t and k = k₀ + k₁p + ... + k_tp^t, then C(n, k) ≡ Π C(n_i, k_i) mod p.\n\nIn our case, n = pⁿm, k = pᵏ. Let's write m as m = m₀ + m₁p + ... + m_tp^t, where 0 ≤ m_i < p. Then pⁿm in base p is m₀pⁿ + m₁p^{n+1} + ... + m_tp^{n+t}. But wait, pⁿm in base p is simply the digits of m shifted n places. For example, if m = a + bp + cp² + ..., then pⁿm = a pⁿ + b p^{n+1} + c p^{n+2} + ... etc. Similarly, k = pᵏ in base p is a 1 followed by k zeros.\n\nAccording to Lucas's theorem, C(pⁿm, pᵏ) ≡ product of C(m_i, 0) for the higher digits and C(0,0) for the lower digits. Wait, let's do this step by step.\n\nLet’s write pⁿm in base p. Let m = m_0 + m_1 p + m_2 p² + ... + m_t p^t, then pⁿm = m_0 pⁿ + m_1 p^{n+1} + ... + m_t p^{n+t}. The number pᵏ in base p is 1 followed by k zeros, i.e., pᵏ = p^{k} = 1 p^{k} + 0 p^{k-1} + ... + 0.\n\nNow, Lucas's theorem tells us that C(pⁿm, pᵏ) ≡ product over all i of C(a_i, b_i) mod p, where a_i and b_i are the digits of pⁿm and pᵏ in base p.\n\nLooking at the digits:\n\n- For the p^{k} place: pⁿm has digit m_{k - n} if k ≥ n, but if k ≤ n, then pⁿm has digit 0 in the p^{k} place. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of specific numbers.\n\nSuppose p=3, n=2, m=2 (so |G|=3²*2=18), and k=1. Then pᵏ=3.\n\npⁿm = 18 = 0*3⁰ + 0*3¹ + 2*3². So in base 3: 18 is 200. pᵏ=3 is 10 in base 3. So C(18,3) ≡ C(0,1)*C(0,0)*C(2,0) mod 3. But C(0,1)=0, so C(18,3)≡0 mod 3. However, the actual number of subgroups of order 3 in a group of order 18 would depend on the group. For example, in the cyclic group C₁₈, there is exactly one subgroup of order 3, which is 1 ≡1 mod 3. But C(18,3)=816 ≡ 816 mod 3=0. This contradicts the requirement. Hence, Lucas's theorem gives |S| ≡0 mod p, but the actual number of subgroups is ≡1 mod p. Therefore, this approach might not work.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the original method of using the conjugation action is more effective. As shown earlier, by considering the conjugation action of P on the set of subgroups of order pᵏ, and using the class equation, we get that the number of such subgroups is ≡1 mod p.\n\nBut the user specifically asked to modify Wielandt's proof, which uses the action on subsets, not on subgroups. Maybe the answer requires combining both approaches. Let me try to structure the assumptions and problem according to the required format.\n\nThe assumptions are:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- |G| = pⁿm, where p is a prime number.\n- p does not divide m (i.e., gcd(p, m) = 1).\n- 0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the number of subgroups of G of order pᵏ is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nBut the original problem's assumptions might not explicitly state that p does not divide m, but since it's part of the standard Sylow theorem setup, it's implied. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is pⁿm, where p is a prime.\n- m is an integer such that p does not divide m.\n- k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for the given problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- G is a finite group,\n- The order of G is pⁿm,\n- p is a prime,\n- m is not divisible by p,\n- k is an integer,\n- 0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the number of subgroups of G of order pᵏ is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nHowever, the user's original question mentions using a modification of Wielandt's proof, which involves acting on subsets and using the orbit-stabilizer theorem. The answer I arrived at uses a different approach (conjugation action on subgroups), but the problem statement itself doesn't specify the method, just the result. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem statement without referencing the proof method.\n\nThe user also mentioned that they knew Wielandt's proof for k=n and wanted to extend it to general k. So the key assumptions are the standard Sylow theorem conditions: |G|=pⁿm, p not dividing m, and 0 ≤k ≤n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- G is a finite group,\n- The order of G is pⁿm where p is a prime,\n- m is an integer not divisible by p,\n- k is an integer,\n- 0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the number of subgroups of G of order pᵏ is congruent to 1 modulo p.",
