    "Content": "I was trying to prove this, and I realized that this is essentially a statement that $n^5$ has the same last digit as $n$, and to prove this it is sufficient to calculate $n^5$ for $0-9$ and see that the respective last digits match. Another approach I tried is this: I factored $n^5-n$ to $n(n^2+1)(n+1)(n-1)$. If $n$ is even, a factor of $2$ is guaranteed by the factor $n$. If $n$ is odd, the factor of $2$ is guaranteed by $(n^2+1)$. The factor of $5$ is guaranteed if the last digit of $n$ is $1, 4, 5, 6,$ $or$ $9$ by the factors $n(n+1)(n-1)$, so I only have to check for $n$ ending in digits $0, 2, 3, 7,$ $and$ $8$.  However, I'm sure that there has to be a much better proof (and without modular arithmetic). Do you guys know one? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof is good enough. There's a slight improvement, if you want to avoid modular arithmetic / considering cases. $n^5 - n$ is a multiple of 5 \n$\\Leftrightarrow$  $ n^5 + 10 n^4 + 35n^3 + 50 n^2 + 24 n = n^5 -n + 5(2n^4 + 7n^3 + 10n^2 + 5n) $ is a multiple of 5. The latter is just $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)$, which is the product of 5 consecutive integers, hence is a multiple of 5. Note: You should generally be able to do the above transformation, and can take the product of any 5 (or k) consecutive integers, if you are looking at a polynomial of degree 5 (or k).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that n^5 - n is divisible by 10 without using modular arithmetic. Let me first parse the original question.\n\nThe user mentions factoring n^5 - n into n(n^2 +1)(n+1)(n-1). They considered even and odd cases for divisibility by 2 and then looked at divisibility by 5. Their approach checks specific last digits but feels cumbersome. They’re seeking a better proof, possibly using factorization or properties of numbers.\n\nFirst, let me recall that 10 is 2*5, so we need to show that n^5 - n is divisible by both 2 and 5. The user already handled divisibility by 2 by splitting into even and odd cases. For 5, they tried checking last digits but want a more general method.\n\nWait, the user factored n^5 -n as n(n^4 -1) = n(n^2 -1)(n^2 +1) = n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 +1). That's correct. Now, for divisibility by 5: Maybe using Fermat's little theorem? But that uses modular arithmetic. The user wants to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, note that n^5 -n can be written as n(n^4 -1) = n(n^2 -1)(n^2 +1). Let me think about the factors. For divisibility by 5, maybe consider possible residues mod 5. But the user doesn't want modular arithmetic. So perhaps check that among any five consecutive numbers, n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 +1) must be divisible by 5? Wait, not consecutive. Alternatively, n^5 -n is the product of n and (n^4 -1). If we can show that either n or n^4 -1 is divisible by 5.\n\nBut how without modular arithmetic? Let's consider possible cases for n mod 5. But again, that's modular. Maybe expand n^5 -n. For example, n^5 -n = n(n^4 -1) = n(n^2 -1)(n^2 +1). Now, if n ≡ 0 mod 5, then n is divisible by 5. If n ≡ 1 or -1 (i.e., 1 or 4 mod 5), then (n-1) or (n+1) is divisible by 5. If n ≡ 2 mod 5, then n^2 +1 = 4 +1 =5, which is divisible by 5. Similarly, if n ≡ 3 mod 5, n^2 +1 =9 +1=10, also divisible by 5. So in all cases, one of the factors is divisible by 5. But explaining this without modular terms might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, expand n^5 -n for n from 0 to 4 and show it's divisible by 5 each time. Then argue by periodicity. But that's similar to modular arithmetic. The user mentioned checking digits 0-9 for the last digit, which is mod 10, but they found that tedious. The example given in the problem statement used checking 0-9, so maybe that's acceptable, but they want a better approach.\n\nAnother way: Induction. Let's try mathematical induction. For n=0, 0^5 -0=0, which is divisible by 10. Assume it's true for n=k. Then show for n=k+1. But expanding (k+1)^5 - (k+1) would involve binomial coefficients. Let's compute:\n\n(k+1)^5 = k^5 + 5k^4 + 10k^3 + 10k^2 +5k +1\n\nSo (k+1)^5 - (k+1) = k^5 +5k^4 +10k^3 +10k^2 +5k +1 -k -1 = k^5 -k +5k^4 +10k^3 +10k^2 +5k\n\nBy induction hypothesis, k^5 -k is divisible by 10. The rest of the terms: 5k^4 +10k^3 +10k^2 +5k =5(k^4 +k) +10(k^3 +k^2). Each term here is divisible by 5 and the second term is divisible by 10. So the entire expression is divisible by 10. Therefore, by induction, it holds for all integers n. Wait, does that work? Let me check.\n\nYes, because if we assume k^5 -k is divisible by 10, then the difference (k+1)^5 - (k+1) equals (k^5 -k) +5(k^4 +k) +10(k^3 +k^2). The first term is divisible by 10, the second term is 5 times something, which is divisible by 5, and the third term is divisible by 10. So together, the entire expression is divisible by 10 only if the second term is also even. Wait, 5(k^4 +k) must be even. Since k^4 and k are both even or both odd. If k is even, k^4 is even, so their sum is even. If k is odd, k^4 is odd, so sum is even. Therefore, 5*(even) is divisible by 10. Hence, the entire expression is divisible by 10. Therefore, induction works. This doesn't use modular arithmetic explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, use the factorization approach. Since n^5 -n = n(n^4 -1) = n(n^2 -1)(n^2 +1) =n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 +1). Now, among n, n-1, n+1, there are three consecutive numbers, so one of them is divisible by 2 and another by 2 as well (since every other number is even). So overall, divisible by 4? Wait, but 10 requires only one factor of 2. Wait, n and n-1 and n+1: if n is even, n is divisible by 2. Then among the three, either n-1 or n+1 is odd. If n is odd, then n-1 and n+1 are even, giving two factors of 2. So in the product n(n-1)(n+1), there's at least two factors of 2, so divisible by 4. Then the n^2 +1 term: if n is even, n^2 is even, so n^2 +1 is odd. If n is odd, n^2 is odd, so n^2 +1 is even. So in either case, the product will have either n or n^2 +1 contributing another factor of 2. Wait:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nCase 1: n is even. Then n contributes a factor of 2. Among n-1, n+1 (which are odd and odd), but n^2 +1 is even+1 = odd if n is even. Wait, no: if n is even, n^2 is even, so n^2 +1 is odd. So in this case, the factors contributing 2 are n and possibly another from n-1 or n+1. Wait, n is even, so n is divisible by 2, and among the three consecutive numbers n-1, n, n+1, there's one even (n) and the other two odd. But n^2 +1 is odd. So total factors of 2: from n and from n(n-1)(n+1), which is n*(n-1)*(n+1). If n is even, then n gives one 2, and among n-1, n+1, since they are consecutive odd numbers, they don't contribute more 2s. But wait, but n^2 +1 is odd here. So total factors of 2: n (one 2) and then from the rest of the product? Wait, n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 +1). If n is even, then n is 2k, and n-1, n+1 are odd, and n^2 +1 is odd. So total factors of 2: only one from n. But we need two factors of 2 for divisibility by 10. Wait, but earlier the user said that if n is even, the factor of 2 is guaranteed by n. If n is odd, by (n^2 +1). Let's check:\n\nIf n is odd: n is odd, so n-1 and n+1 are even. So among n-1 and n+1, there are two consecutive even numbers, so one is divisible by 4 and the other by 2. So their product is divisible by 8. Then, n^2 +1: if n is odd, n=2k+1, so n^2=4k^2 +4k +1, so n^2 +1=4k^2 +4k +2=2(2k^2 +2k +1), which is even. So that contributes another factor of 2. So total factors of 2: from n-1 and n+1, we have 8 (from 4*2), and from n^2 +1, another 2, so total 16? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nBut for divisibility by 10, we need at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 5. The user's original approach was handling the 2 by splitting into even and odd cases. For the 5, they tried checking last digits but wanted a better method.\n\nBut according to the induction approach above, we can prove divisibility by 10 by induction without modular arithmetic. Alternatively, using factorization and considering that n^5 -n is divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that n^5 -n is the product of five consecutive numbers? Wait, no. Wait, n^5 -n =n(n^4 -1)=n(n^2 -1)(n^2 +1). Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: n^5 -n can be written as n(n^4 -1) = n(n^2 -1)(n^2 +1) = (n-1)n(n+1)(n^2 +1). The product (n-1)n(n+1) is three consecutive integers, so divisible by 2 and 3. Then multiplied by (n^2 +1). To get divisibility by 5, need to show that either one of the factors (n-1), n, (n+1), or (n^2 +1) is divisible by 5.\n\nIf n ≡0 mod5, then n is divisible by 5.\n\nIf n≡1 mod5, then n-1 divisible by5.\n\nIf n≡4 mod5, then n+1 divisible by5.\n\nIf n≡2 mod5, then n^2 +1=4+1=5 divisible by5.\n\nIf n≡3 mod5, then n^2=9≡4 mod5, so n^2 +1=5≡0 mod5.\n\nThus, in all cases, one of the factors is divisible by5. But explaining this without modular arithmetic requires considering cases based on the last digit or some property. Alternatively, express n as 5k, 5k±1, 5k±2.\n\nWait, 5k±1 would cover n≡1,4 mod5, and 5k±2 covers 2,3 mod5. Then:\n\nIf n=5k: divisible by5.\n\nIf n=5k±1: (n∓1)=5k divisible by5.\n\nIf n=5k±2: n^2 +1=(25k² ±20k +4) +1=25k² ±20k +5=5(5k² ±4k +1) divisible by5.\n\nHence, in all cases, n^5 -n is divisible by5. This approach uses expressing n in terms of 5k, 5k±1, 5k±2, which is akin to modular arithmetic but framed differently.\n\nCombining this with the divisibility by 2 (which can be shown by considering even/odd as the user did) gives divisibility by 10.\n\nSo the problem can be structured by extracting the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe original question is: Prove that n^5 -n is divisible by 10. The user's own approach considered factoring and checking cases for divisibility by 2 and 5. The assumptions here are that n is an integer, but no other conditions. The problem is to prove divisibility by 10 for any integer n.\n\nBut looking at the example provided earlier, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the example, the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. However, in the current problem, there are no additional constraints; the user is considering all integers n. So the assumption is simply that n is an integer.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem's assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem listed them as separate assumptions. So for this problem, the only assumption is that n is an integer.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that n^5 -n is divisible by 10.\n\nBut let's double-check the original question's content. The user titled it: \"$n^5-n$ is divisible by $10$?\" and the question starts with trying to prove it. So the problem is general for any integer n. The assumptions are just that n is an integer. There's no mention of any restrictions like n being divisible by 7 or anything else. Hence, the formatted problem should have only one assumption: n is an integer.\n\nBut wait, the example given by the user had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in their example, the original problem had an extra condition. In this case, the current problem doesn't have any extra conditions beyond n being an integer. So the formatted problem should list only that n is an integer.",
