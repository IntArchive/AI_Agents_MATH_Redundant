    "Content": "I am stuck on the following problem from Stein and Shakarchi's third book. I can't figure out how to use the hint productively. Once I know $f$ is a trigonometric polynomial, I see how to finish the problem, but I don't know how to conclude that $f$ is a trigonometric polynomial. I tried substituting in the Fourier transform in the formula for Fourier coefficients and switching the order of integration, but I couldn't get that to work. I can't think of any more ideas. Problem: Suppose $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. Prove $f$ and $\\hat f$ cannot both be compactly supported unless $f=0$. Hint: Suppose $f$ is supported in $[0, 1/2]$ and expand it in a Fourier series in $[0,1]$. Show $f$ must be a trigonometric polynomial. This question was asked before, but with different hypotheses and in the context of complex analysis. Please do not close as a duplicate.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Further hint: let $c_n$ the $n$-th Fourier coefficient of $f$. We can write $\\widehat f(n)=c_n$ and since $\\widehat f$ is compactly supported, $c_n$ vanishes for $n$ large enough. It implies that $f$ is a trigonometric polynomial. The hypothesis of the hint is not restrictive: using a substitution in the integral defining the Fourier transform, we can assume that the support of $f$ is contained in $[0,a]$ for some $a>0$, then define $g(x):=f\\left(\\frac x{2a}\\right)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully. The user is referencing Stein and Shakarchi's third book, and the problem is about proving that a continuous function and its Fourier transform can't both be compactly supported unless the function is zero. The user also mentions a hint about expanding the function in a Fourier series if it's supported in [0, 1/2] and showing it's a trigonometric polynomial.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that f is continuous on ℝ. The goal is to prove that f and its Fourier transform can't both be compactly supported unless f is zero. The key points here are the continuity of f, the compact support of both f and its Fourier transform, and the conclusion that f must be zero.\n\nThe example given in the user's instruction lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. f is continuous on ℝ.\n2. f is compactly supported.\n3. The Fourier transform of f, denoted as ̂f, is also compactly supported.\n\nThese are three separate assumptions, each applying to different objects (f's continuity, f's support, ̂f's support). The problem then is to prove that under these conditions, f must be identically zero.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"Prove f and ̂f cannot both be compactly supported unless f=0.\" So the unless part is important. So maybe the assumptions should list the conditions under which the conclusion holds. So the problem is: If f is continuous on ℝ, and both f and ̂f are compactly supported, then f must be zero. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a continuous function on ℝ.\n- f has compact support.\n- ̂f (the Fourier transform of f) has compact support.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, f must be the zero function.\n\nI need to check if the user mentioned anything else as part of the problem's given information. The question mentions that the user tried using the hint about expanding f in a Fourier series in [0,1] if it's supported in [0,1/2], leading to f being a trigonometric polynomial. But the original problem doesn't specify the support interval; it's a general statement. However, the hint seems to suggest considering a specific interval, but the problem as stated is general. So perhaps the key assumptions are just continuity and both f and ̂f being compactly supported. The specific interval in the hint might be part of the method to solve it but not part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nf is continuous on ℝ,\nf is compactly supported,\n̂f is compactly supported.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f must be identically zero.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the original problem statement here, the user hasn't specified any particular interval for the support; it's just a general compact support. The hint mentions [0,1/2] and expanding in [0,1], but that's part of the hint, not the problem's given conditions. Therefore, the problem's actual assumptions are the three I listed.\n\nI should ensure that each assumption is a single line, addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$,\n$f$ is compactly supported,\n$\\hat{f}$ is compactly supported.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ must be identically zero.\n\nThat should be correct. The original problem says \"Prove $f$ and $\\hat f$ cannot both be compactly supported unless $f=0$.\" So the conditions are that both are compactly supported, and then the conclusion is $f=0$. The continuity is also given as part of the problem statement. The user also mentions that the problem is from Stein and Shakarchi, so likely the problem as posed in the book includes the continuity condition. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those three assumptions.",
