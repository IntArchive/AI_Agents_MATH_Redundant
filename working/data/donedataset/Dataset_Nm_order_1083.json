    "AcceptedAnswer": "First of all let us introduce the function\n$$ F(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}\\sum_{k=0}^{2n}\\frac{x^{2n+4k+3}}{2n+4k+3} $$\nWe need to compute $F(1)$. Let us start by calculating\n$$ x^{-2}F'(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}\\sum_{k=0}^{2n}x^{2n+4k}=\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}\\frac{x^{2n}-x^{4+10n}}{1-x^4}=\\frac{\\arctan x-\\arctan x^5}{x(1-x^4)},$$\nwhere the first step is obtained by straightforward differentiation, the second equality follows by summation of finite geometric series, and the third one is obtained from the series representation $\\arctan x=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$. Since it is clear from the definition that $F(0)=0$, we find\n$$ F(1)=\\int_0^1\\frac{x\\left(\\arctan x-\\arctan x^5\\right) dx}{1-x^4}$$\nIntegrate by parts using that $\\int\\frac{xdx}{1-x^4}=\\frac14\\ln\\frac{1+x^2}{1-x^2}$ (and saying appropriate words about the limits). This gives\n\\begin{align*}\nF(1)=\\frac14\\int_0^1\\left(\\frac{1}{1+x^2}-\\frac{5x^4}{1+x^{10}}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}\\right)dx=\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\\\\n=\\frac14\\int_0^1\\frac{(1+x^2)(1-3x^2+x^4)}{x^8-x^6+x^4-x^2+1}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}\\right)dx.\\qquad\\qquad (\\mathrm{A})\n\\end{align*} Notice that the change of integration variable $x\\rightarrow 1/x$ and parity allow to rewrite (A) as \n$$F(1)=\\frac{1}{16}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{(1+x^2)(1-3x^2+x^4)}{x^8-x^6+x^4-x^2+1}\\ln\\left|\\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}\\right|dx $$\nNext we write this in terms of complex contour integral:\n$$F(1)=\\frac{1}{16}\\mathrm{Re}\\left\\{\\int_C f(z)dz\\right\\}\\qquad\\qquad (\\mathrm{B})$$\nwith \n$$ f(z)=\\frac{(1+z^2)(1-3z^2+z^4)}{z^8-z^6+z^4-z^2+1}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-z^2}{1+z^2}\\right) $$\nAt this point, some comments are necessary: the function $f(z)$ has a number of singularities in the complex $z$-plane. First of all one has 8 simple poles $z=\\exp\\pm\\frac{ik\\pi}{10}$, $k=1,3,7,9$. One also has logarithmic branch points $z=\\pm1,\\pm i$. Accordingly, we introduce 4 branch cuts: $B_{1}=[1,\\infty)$, $B_{-1}=(-\\infty,-1]$, $B_i=[i,i\\infty)$, $B_{-i}=(-i\\infty,-i]$. the contour of integration $C$ runs from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ slightly above the real axis (we could put it slightly below and modify what follows). The logarithms in $f(z)$ will be defined on their main sheets for $z\\in(-1,1)$, then $f(z)$ is unambigously defined in the cut plane by analytic continuation. Going slightly above the branch cuts $B_{\\pm1}$ produces (irrelevant) imaginary parts in the logarithms. This explains the need to take real part in (B). Now the idea is to pull the contour $C$ to $i\\infty$. The integral will then be given by the sum of residues at $z=\\exp\\frac{ik\\pi}{10}$, $k=1,3,7,9$, plus integral of the jump of $f(z)$ on the cut $B_i$. It is not difficult to understand that the latter is real (rational prefactor $\\frac{(1+z^2)(1-3z^2+z^4)}{z^8-z^6+z^4-z^2+1}$ is real on the cut, the logarithm jumps by $2\\pi i$ and the integral is along $B_i$\nso that the integration variable is pure imaginary). Therefore we are left with\n$$F(1)=\\frac{1}{16}\\left[2\\pi\\int_1^{\\infty}\\frac{(1-x^2)(1+3x^2+x^4)dx}{x^8+x^6+x^4+x^2+1}+\\mathrm{Re}\\left\\{2\\pi i \\sum_{k=1,3,7,9}\\mathrm{res}_{z=\\exp\\frac{ik\\pi}{10}}f(z)\\right\\}\\right]\\qquad(\\mathrm{C})$$\nIn the first integral we have a rational function, so it can be calculated by elementary means:\n$$\\int_1^{\\infty}\\frac{(1-x^2)(1+3x^2+x^4)dx}{x^8+x^6+x^4+x^2+1}=\\left[\\frac12\\ln\\frac{1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4}{1-x+x^2-x^3+x^4}\\right]_{x=1}^{x=\\infty}=-\\frac{\\ln5}{2}$$\nThe residues are also relatively easily computed:\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{res}_{z=\\exp\\frac{i\\pi}{10}}f(z)=\\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\ln\\tan\\frac{\\pi}{10}-\\frac{i\\pi}{2}\\right),\\\\\n\\mathrm{res}_{z=\\exp\\frac{3i\\pi}{10}}f(z)=-\\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\ln\\tan\\frac{3\\pi}{10}-\\frac{i\\pi}{2}\\right),\\\\\n\\mathrm{res}_{z=\\exp\\frac{7i\\pi}{10}}f(z)=-\\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\ln\\tan\\frac{3\\pi}{10}+\\frac{i\\pi}{2}\\right),\\\\\n\\mathrm{res}_{z=\\exp\\frac{9i\\pi}{10}}f(z)=\\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\ln\\tan\\frac{\\pi}{10}+\\frac{i\\pi}{2}\\right).\n\\end{align}\nSubstituting this into (C), we finally obtain\n$$ F(1)=\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\left(\\ln\\frac{\\tan\\frac{3\\pi}{10}}{\\tan\\frac{\\pi}{10}}-\\frac{\\ln 5}{2}\\right) $$\nThe statement now follows from the easily verified identity $\\frac{\\tan\\frac{3\\pi}{10}}{\\tan\\frac{\\pi}{10}}=\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^3$. $\\blacksquare$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem according to the user's instructions. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user provided an example where they listed each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then, they restated the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the problem from Math Stack Exchange:\n\nThe title is: How can I find [sum from n=0 to infinity of ( (-1)^n / (2n+1) * sum from k=0 to 2n of 1/(2n + 4k +3) ) ] equals ... ?\n\nThe question states that we need to prove the given infinite sum equals that expression involving pi and logarithms. The user mentions they think the sum over k can be expressed using harmonic numbers: H_{10n+3} - H_{2n+3}.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out any unnecessary information. The problem is to prove the equality of the infinite sum to the specified expression. The mention of harmonic numbers might be part of their attempt, but the actual problem as posed doesn't include that as an assumption—it's part of their thought process.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is stated. The problem doesn't specify any particular constraints on n or k, other than n starting at 0 and going to infinity, and k from 0 to 2n. However, in the series, denominators like 2n+4k+3 must not be zero, which would be true for n and k non-negative integers. But since the problem is presented as is, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the variables being in their specified ranges. But according to the example given, the user included assumptions that were in the problem, like n is an integer. Here, n and k are integers, starting from 0 upwards. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk ranges from 0 to 2n for each n.\n\nBut the example given only listed assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. The original problem here doesn't state any restrictions explicitly beyond the summation indices. However, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's statement (since the user wrote \"for every integer n\" but later the formatted problem added divisibility by 7—wait, wait, looking back, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, in the example, perhaps there was a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be incorrect. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like an error. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. So maybe the example was wrong, but perhaps the user intended to extract assumptions from the problem, but in this case, the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7. Wait, perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was edited. Hmm. Anyway, the key point is that in the current problem, the user's instruction is to list all assumptions of the problem, each as a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the summations are over n starting at 0 to infinity, and k from 0 to 2n. So n is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2n. However, in the problem statement, there's no explicit mention of constraints, but in mathematical sums like this, the variables are typically integers in their respective ranges. The problem is to prove the equality. So the assumptions would be that n and k are non-negative integers with k ≤ 2n, and that the series converges (but convergence is part of the problem's consideration, not an assumption). Alternatively, the problem might just assume standard convergence without stating it. However, the example given didn't include convergence; it included explicit conditions on n.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only assumption here is that n and k are non-negative integers, but since n is the summation index starting at 0, and k ranges from 0 to 2n, maybe the key assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. But the problem as stated is to compute the sum, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the variables being in their natural ranges. However, in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, similarly, we need to state:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk is less than or equal to 2n.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk is in the range 0 ≤ k ≤ 2n.\n\nBut maybe the last one is considered a single condition. However, the example's assumption was written as two separate lines: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each line is a separate condition. So here, for each variable, list their conditions.\n\nBut in this problem, the variables are defined in their ranges. So n is an integer ≥ 0, k is an integer ≥0 and ≤2n. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk ≤ 2n.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly state these; they are implicit in the summation notation. However, according to the user's example, even if the original problem just says \"for every integer n\", they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, we should list the variables' domains as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer (since the sum starts at n=0 and goes to infinity),\n- k is a non-negative integer (as k starts at 0),\n- k is less than or equal to 2n (since k ranges from 0 to 2n).\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Similarly, here, the summations are over n and k as integers in their respective ranges, so the assumptions would be that n and k are integers in those ranges. However, the original problem didn't explicitly state \"n and k are integers\", but in mathematical notation, the summation indices are typically integers unless otherwise specified. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 0,\nk is an integer,\n0 ≤ k ≤ 2n.\n\nEach of these on separate lines.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the problem is presented in standard mathematical notation where summation indices are integers, maybe the user wants to list the key assumptions, even if they're implicit. However, in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, so following that, here we should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 2n.\n\nBut each condition per line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk ≤ 2n.\n\nBut \"k ≤ 2n\" is a condition relating k and n. However, in the example, the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" is a condition on n alone. Here, \"k ≤ 2n\" relates two variables. But the instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps we need to break it down.\n\nWait, maybe the problem's assumptions are only the necessary ones for the problem to make sense. For example, the denominators in the sum terms are 2n + 4k + 3. Since n and k are non-negative integers, 2n +4k +3 is always at least 3, so no division by zero. Therefore, no additional assumptions needed beyond the summation ranges. But the problem as posed doesn't state any explicit assumptions beyond the summations.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So here, since the summations are over n starting at 0 to infinity and k from 0 to 2n, the assumptions would be that n and k are integers in those ranges. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk is less than or equal to 2n.\n\nEach on separate lines.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\". The additional assumption in the example (n divisible by 7) might have been part of a modified problem. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Perhaps the example was incorrect, or maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Anyway, perhaps the example is not to be followed exactly but to understand the structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to prove the equality of the sum to that expression. The problem doesn't state any restrictions beyond the summation indices. So the key assumptions are the variables being non-negative integers in their respective ranges.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk ≤ 2n.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}\\sum_{k=0}^{2n}\\frac{1}{2n+4k+3}\\right)=\\frac{3\\pi}{8}\\log\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)-\\frac{\\pi}{16}\\log 5.$$\n\nBut the original problem also mentions that the user thinks the inner sum can be expressed as H_{10n+3} - H_{2n+3}, but this is part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. So we should exclude that.\n\nSo the final answer would list the assumptions about n and k being non-negative integers with k ≤2n, then the problem statement.",
