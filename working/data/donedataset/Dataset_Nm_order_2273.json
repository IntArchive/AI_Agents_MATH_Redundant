    "Content": "Let $E$ be the splitting field of $x^6-2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Show that $Gal(E/\\mathbb{Q})\\cong D_6$, the dihedral group of the regular hexagon. I've shown that $E=\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6, \\sqrt[6]{2})$, where $\\zeta_6$ is a (fixed) primitive sixth root of unity, and thus that $[E:\\mathbb{Q}]=12$. I'm getting a little mixed up working out the automorphisms, though. I know the Galois group is determined by the action on the generators $\\zeta_6$ and $\\sqrt[n]{2}$. So then the possibilities appear to be: \\begin{align*}\\sqrt[6]{2}&\\mapsto\\zeta_6^n\\sqrt[6]{2}\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{ for } n=0,1,\\ldots ,5 \\\\ \\zeta_6&\\mapsto \\zeta_6^j\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{ for } j=1,5\\,.\\end{align*} Does this make sense? Something doesn't quite feel right, but I'm not sure where the issue might be. I know that in some sense the generators are \"independent\", because I definitely can't get one generator from the other. (For example, it'd be different if we had fourth roots of unity because we could get $\\sqrt{2}$ from both generators.) Any help is appreciated",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By definition of the splitting field, it is generated by the roots of $x^6 - 2$. These roots form the vertices of a regular hexagon on the complex plane. Any element of the Galois group must permute the roots, and is completely determined by what it does to the roots, since the splitting group is generated by them. Let $\\sigma$ be an element of the Galois group. Now consider what happens to two adjacent vertices, $\\zeta_6^i\\sqrt[6]{2}$ and $\\zeta_6^{i+1}\\sqrt[6]{2}$. By considering\n$$\\frac{\\zeta_6^{i+1}\\sqrt[6]{2}}{\\zeta_6^{i}\\sqrt[6]{2}} = \\zeta_6,$$\nthe action of $\\sigma$ on the two adjacent vertices determines the action on $\\zeta_6$. Since $\\zeta_6$ satisfies $\\Phi_6(x) = x^2-x+1$, the image of $\\zeta_6$ must be another root of $x^2-x+1$, which is either $\\zeta_6$ or $\\zeta_6^5$, as you note. And if you know what happens to $\\zeta_6^i\\sqrt[6]{2}$ and to $\\zeta_6$, then you know what happens to $\\sqrt[6]{2}$ as well. And of course, if you know what happens to both of these, then you know what happens to the adjacent vertices $\\sqrt[6]{2}$ and $\\zeta_6\\sqrt[6]{2}$. So knowing the action on at least two adjacent vertices is equivalent to knowing the action on $\\sqrt[6]{2}$ and on $\\zeta_6$, and vice versa, and this in turn tells you what is happening on all the vertices. This shows that what you are saying is correct. Now, to finish off, try showing that two adjacent vertices are always mapped to two adjacent vertices, so that any permutation of the hexagon induced by $\\sigma\\in\\mathrm{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$ is actually a rigid motion of the hexagon. This will show the Galois group is contained in the dihedral group, and the computation of the order that you have already done will finish off the problem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the question from Math Stack Exchange, filter out unrelated information, and present the problem with clear assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nFirst, looking at the original problem: The user is asking about showing that the Galois group of the splitting field E of x^6 - 2 over Q is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6. They mention that E is Q(ζ6, 6th root of 2), and they've already found the degree [E:Q] = 12. They're confused about working out the automorphisms, specifically how the generators ζ6 and 6√2 are mapped. They list possible mappings for each generator and express some uncertainty about whether this is correct.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the main problem. The assumptions should be individual conditions applied to single objects. Let's see:\n\n1. E is the splitting field of x^6 - 2 over Q. That's given.\n2. E is equal to Q(ζ6, 6√2), which the user has already shown. So that's another assumption.\n3. ζ6 is a fixed primitive 6th root of unity. This is important because different roots of unity can affect the automorphisms.\n4. The degree [E : Q] is 12. The user states they've already proven this, so it's an established condition.\n5. The Galois group is determined by its action on the generators ζ6 and 6√2. This is a key point in determining the automorphisms.\n6. The possible mappings for 6√2 are to ζ6^n * 6√2 for n = 0,1,...,5. This is part of their reasoning but might not be an assumption. Wait, actually, this is part of their attempt, not an assumption given by the problem. So maybe not an assumption. Similarly, the mappings for ζ6 to ζ6^j where j=1,5. But again, that's their own reasoning.\n\nSo the problem's actual assumptions would be:\n\n- E is the splitting field of x^6 - 2 over Q.\n- E = Q(ζ6, 6√2), with ζ6 a primitive 6th root of unity.\n- [E : Q] = 12.\n\nThe problem is to show that Gal(E/Q) is isomorphic to D6, the dihedral group of the regular hexagon.\n\nThe user's confusion about automorphisms and the possible mappings is part of their attempt but not part of the problem's assumptions. So the assumptions should be the given conditions, not their reasoning steps.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- E is the splitting field of x^6 - 2 over Q.\n- E = Q(ζ₆, √[6]{2}), where ζ₆ is a primitive sixth root of unity.\n- [E : Q] = 12.\n\nProblem: Show that Gal(E/Q) ≅ D₆, the dihedral group of the regular hexagon.\n\nWait, but the original problem in the example included some specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are more about the structure of E. Let me check the example again. The example took the original problem, which had the user possibly assuming n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, in the example, the user's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but the original problem didn't mention that. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, the original example says: Original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Maybe the example is wrong, but I need to follow the instructions. But according to the user's example, they filtered the problem, perhaps extracting implicit assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem had an error, and the example corrected it? Hmm. Well, perhaps in the current problem, we need to list all the given assumptions as per the problem statement. The original problem says \"Let E be the splitting field of x^6 - 2 over Q. Show that Gal(E/Q) ≅ D6.\" So the explicit assumptions are that E is the splitting field, E is Q(ζ6, 6√2), and [E:Q]=12. Wait, but the problem statement says \"I've shown that E=...\" so that's part of the given information. So in the problem, the user has already established certain facts, which we can take as assumptions for the problem they are currently working on. So in their current problem, they want to show Gal(E/Q) ≅ D6, given that E is the splitting field, E is generated by ζ6 and 6√2, and the degree is 12. So those are the assumptions. The user's confusion about automorphisms is part of their attempt, but not part of the problem's assumptions. So the structured problem should list those three assumptions, then state the problem as showing the Galois group is D6. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$E$ is the splitting field of $x^6 - 2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$,\n$E = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6, \\sqrt[6]{2})$ where $\\zeta_6$ is a primitive sixth root of unity,\n$[E : \\mathbb{Q}] = 12$.\nProblem:\nShow that $\\mathrm{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong D_6$, the dihedral group of the regular hexagon.\n###",
