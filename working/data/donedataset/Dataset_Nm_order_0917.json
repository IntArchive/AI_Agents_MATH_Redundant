    "Content": "Suppose that $f$ is differentiable on $[a, b]$. Prove that if $f'(a) < c < f'(b)$, then $f'(x) = c$ for some $x$ in $(a,b)$. (This result is known as Darboux's theorem .) Source: Spivak's Calculus Ch.11 - Significance of the Derivative. I have a hard time picturing this or interpreting it... What are the implications of this? Similarly, for another theorem introduced in the same chapter, I am having the problem of seeing the significance of this... Suppose that $f$ is continuous at $a$, and that $f'(x)$ exists for all $x$ in some interval containing $a$, except perhaps for $x = a$. Suppose, moreover, that $\\lim \\limits_{x \\to a} f'(x)$ exists. Then $f'(a)$ also exists, and $f'(a) = \\lim \\limits_{x \\to a} f'(x)$. Doesn't this mean that $f'$ is just continuous at point $a$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One says that a function $f: I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ has the Intermediate Value Property (IVP) if for all $a < b \\in I$ and all $L$ in between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ , there exists $c \\in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = L$ . Certainly the most famous and important class of functions which satisfy IVP are the continuous functions: this is the content of the Intermediate Value Theorem . Darboux's Theorem gives a second class of functions which satisfy IVP: derivatives.  Note well: not the differentiable functions but the functions which are of the form $f'$ for some other function $f$ . This is certainly an interesting result, if somewhat subtle: most of the differentiable functions one meets in freshman calculus actually have continuous derivatives, and in this case the fact that $f'$ satisfies IVP follows from the Intermediate Value Theorem.  But indeed there are derivatives which are discontinuous, even rather badly: namely there are differentiable functions $f: [a,b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f': [a,b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ exists but is unbounded.  There are also differentiable functions with a derivative $f'$ which is bounded but nevertheless not Riemann integrable. One can view the significance of Darboux's Theorem as follows: it says that a derivative can be discontinuous but cannot have a jump discontinuity , i.e., a discontinuity in which the one-sided limits exist but are different (and also not a removable discontinuity , when the limit exists but is not equal to the value at the point).  This is an interesting contrast to monotone functions , which also need not be continuous but can have only jump discontinuities. In terms of actual applications of Darboux's Theorem...it seems they are rather few.  As I mentioned in my (Spivak calculus) class, you can use Darboux's Theorem together with the (deep!) theorem that every continuous function admits an antiderivative to prove the Intermediate Value Theorem...but this is a strange way to prove IVT. About the second result you mention: I admit to being somewhat perplexed as to what that is doing there: it is really not a standard textbook result.  I seem to recall that this theorem gets used for something later on in the book, though: let's wait and see.  (I am almost halfway through my year long course and we have currently covered about the first 13 chapters.) I have some lecture notes for this course I'm teaching -- you're more than welcome to take a look at them. Here ( Wayback Machine ) is the main course page. This handout on differentiation and this handout including the \"Monotone Jump Theorem\" (on discontinuities of monotone functions) are directly relevant to your question.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. Let me start by understanding the original problem and the example provided.\n\nFirst, the example shows that the formatted problem lists each assumption line by line, addressing one property or condition per line applied to a single object. Then the problem statement is given. The original problem in the example was about proving that A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the formatted problem, they listed the assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", then the problem statement.\n\nNow, looking at the current problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is about interpreting Darboux's Theorem, and the question has two parts. The first part is to prove that if f is differentiable on [a, b] and f’(a) < c < f’(b), then there exists some x in (a,b) where f’(x) = c. The second part refers to another theorem about the existence of f’(a) when the limit of f’(x) as x approaches a exists, and f is continuous at a and differentiable around a. The user is confused about the significance and implications, thinking maybe f’ is continuous at a.\n\nThe task is to structure this into Assumptions and Problem parts. The example shows that assumptions are conditions given in the problem. So for the first theorem (Darboux's), the problem is to prove that under certain conditions, there exists x where f’(x)=c. The assumptions here would be the conditions given: f is differentiable on [a, b], f’(a) < c < f’(b). Each of these should be separate lines.\n\nThen the problem statement is to prove that f’(x)=c for some x in (a,b). The second part of the question is about another theorem. But in the example, only the main problem was formatted. However, the user's original question includes two parts. Wait, but the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", so perhaps each theorem is a separate problem? Let me check the example again. The example only addressed one problem. The original question here has two theorems mentioned. However, the user might want each theorem as a separate problem? Or maybe the user wants to focus on the first one, since the title is about Darboux's theorem, and the second part is an additional confusion.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the task is to read the mathematics question on Math SE, filter unrelated information, and structure the problem into assumptions and problem. The original question includes two theorems. However, the user may want to structure both, but perhaps the example only addressed one. Let me re-examine the original problem.\n\nOriginal problem: The user is asking about interpreting Darboux's Theorem and another theorem. The first part is to prove Darboux's theorem, and the second part is about the theorem regarding the existence of f’(a) when the limit exists. The user is confused about the implications, thinking that it would mean f’ is continuous at a. So the problem has two separate theorems mentioned. However, the way to structure it would be to split them into two separate problems? Or perhaps the user wants to structure each theorem as a separate problem. The example only had one problem. But since the original question includes two distinct theorems, maybe each should be formatted separately. However, the user's example only had one problem. Let me check the user's instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example given includes one problem with its assumptions. The original problem here has two theorems, so maybe each theorem is a separate problem. However, the user's answer should follow the format given. Let me parse the original question.\n\nThe first part: \"Suppose that f is differentiable on [a, b]. Prove that if f'(a) < c < f'(b), then f'(x) = c for some x in (a,b). (This result is known as Darboux's theorem.)\"\n\nThe second part: \"Suppose that f is continuous at a, and that f’(x) exists for all x in some interval containing a, except perhaps for x = a. Suppose, moreover, that lim x→a f’(x) exists. Then f’(a) also exists, and f’(a) = lim x→a f’(x). Doesn't this mean that f’ is just continuous at point a?\"\n\nSo there are two distinct problems here. The first is Darboux's theorem, the second is about the continuity of the derivative. The user is asking about both. But according to the format, each problem should be structured with assumptions and problem. So perhaps we need to structure each theorem as a separate problem.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an extra condition (divisible by 7) which was included in the assumptions. The user is to filter unrelated information, so maybe the second part of the question (the user's confusion about implications) is unrelated to structuring the problem. The actual problem statements are the two theorems.\n\nTherefore, the answer should include two formatted problems: one for Darboux's theorem and one for the second theorem about the derivative's existence and limit.\n\nBut let me check the example again. The example included the problem as presented, with assumptions. The original problem here for Darboux's theorem has the following assumptions:\n\n- f is differentiable on [a, b]\n- f’(a) < c < f’(b)\n\nThen the problem is to prove that f’(x)=c for some x in (a,b).\n\nFor the second theorem:\n\n- f is continuous at a\n- f’(x) exists for all x in some interval containing a, except perhaps x = a\n- lim x→a f’(x) exists\n\nThen the problem is to prove that f’(a) exists and equals the limit. The user's question then asks if this implies f’ is continuous at a, but that's part of their confusion, not part of the problem statement. So the problem here is to state the theorem, which is already done.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer should have two separate entries. However, the user's example only included one problem. The instructions say \"structure that problem\" (singular), but the original question has two. Maybe the user wants both to be formatted. Alternatively, the user might only want the first one, as the title is about Darboux's theorem. But the original question does mention both. Let me proceed to format both.\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumptions:\nf is differentiable on [a, b],\nf’(a) < c < f’(b).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f’(x) = c for some x in (a, b).\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumptions:\nf is continuous at a,\nf’(x) exists for all x in some interval containing a (except possibly x = a),\nlim_{x→a} f’(x) exists.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f’(a) exists and f’(a) = lim_{x→a} f’(x).\n\nHowever, the user also asks \"Doesn't this mean that f’ is just continuous at point a?\" but that's part of their confusion, not part of the problem statement. So in formatting the problem, we focus on the theorem statements, not the follow-up questions about implications. The problem is to prove the theorem, not to interpret continuity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer should have two separate problems. But the user's example only had one. However, given the instructions, perhaps the answer should include both. Alternatively, if the user wants only the main problem (Darboux's theorem), but the original question includes both. The title mentions Darboux's theorem, but the body includes both. The user needs to structure the problem as per the given format, filtering unrelated information. The \"significance\" part is the user's confusion, which is not part of the problem statement, so it should be filtered out.\n\nHence, the answer should format both theorems as separate problems. However, the example given by the user included only one problem. But the instructions do not specify whether multiple problems should be handled. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question text: The user is asking about two theorems from Spivak's Calculus. The first is Darboux's theorem, the second is about the derivative existing at a point if the limit of the derivative exists. The user is confused about the implications of both.\n\nBut according to the task, we need to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". The \"unrelated informations\" would be the user's confusion about the significance and implications, and their questions about continuity. So we need to extract the actual mathematical problems to be structured.\n\nTherefore, the answer should present both theorems as separate problems. Each theorem's assumptions and problem statement.\n\nSo first problem:\n\nAssumption: \nf is differentiable on [a, b],\nf’(a) < c < f’(b).\n\nProblem: Prove that f’(x) = c for some x in (a, b).\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf is continuous at a,\nf’(x) exists for all x in some interval containing a (except possibly x = a),\nlim_{x→a} f’(x) exists.\n\nProblem: Prove that f’(a) exists and f’(a) = lim_{x→a} f’(x).\n\nBut the example provided by the user had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and one problem. So each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object. Here, for the first problem, the assumptions are about f: differentiable on [a,b], and the inequalities on f’(a) and f’(b). The second problem's assumptions are about f being continuous at a, f’ existing around a except possibly at a, and the limit existing.\n\nThus, the answer should have two separate formatted problems. However, the user's example had only one. But given the instructions, it's better to structure each theorem as a separate problem. Therefore, the final answer should have both.",
