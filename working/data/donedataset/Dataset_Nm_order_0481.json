    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. So first, I need to read the original problem carefully and extract the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThe original problem is about showing that sin(x)/x is not Lebesgue integrable on the non-negative real numbers. The user mentions f(x) = sin(x)/x on R≥0. Then they discuss the integral of |f| being finite if and only if both the integrals of f+ and f- are finite. They are trying to show that the integral of f+ is infinite. The steps involve partitioning the integral into a sum over intervals [2πk, 2πk + π] for k starting from 1. They have two questions: one about the correctness of partitioning the Lebesgue integral into an infinite sum of integrals over disjoint domains, and another about a lower bound for the sum that diverges.\n\nSo, to list the assumptions. The first assumption is that f(x) is defined as sin(x)/x on the domain R≥0. Then, the problem involves Lebesgue integrability, so another assumption is that the integral in question is a Lebesgue integral. The user is focusing on f+, the positive part of f. The problem mentions partitioning the integral into a sum over intervals [2πk, 2πk + π], which are specific intervals where sin(x) is positive (since sin(x) is positive between 2πk and 2πk + π for each integer k). So another assumption is that these intervals are pairwise disjoint and their union covers the domain where f+ is non-zero. Wait, the user is asserting that the integral of f+ can be written as the sum from k=1 to infinity of the integral over those intervals. So the assumption here is that the domain where f is positive can be expressed as the union of these intervals, which are pairwise disjoint. Therefore, each interval [2πk, 2πk + π] is part of the domain where sin(x)/x is positive. Since sin(x) is positive in those intervals, and x is positive there, f(x) is indeed positive. So the partitioning is correct in terms of covering the positive parts.\n\nAdditionally, the user is replacing x in the denominator with 2πk + π, which is the maximum value of x in each interval [2πk, 2πk + π]. Since x ≥ 2πk in each interval, 1/x ≤ 1/(2πk). But they used 2πk + π in the denominator, which is the upper bound of the interval. So in each interval, x ≤ 2πk + π, hence 1/x ≥ 1/(2πk + π). Therefore, sin(x)/x ≥ sin(x)/(2πk + π) on each interval. Since sin(x) is positive there, integrating sin(x)/x over the interval would be greater than or equal to integrating sin(x)/(2πk + π) over the same interval. Therefore, the inequality step is valid.\n\nFor the assumptions, each should be a single property or condition. So let's list them:\n\n1. f(x) = sin(x)/x is defined on ℝ≥0.\n2. The integral considered is the Lebesgue integral.\n3. The positive part f⁺(x) is considered.\n4. The intervals [2πk, 2πk + π] for k ≥ 1 are pairwise disjoint and cover the domain where f⁺(x) is non-zero.\n5. On each interval [2πk, 2πk + π], x ≤ 2πk + π.\n\nWait, but the problem is the user is asking whether the first step is correct, which is asserting that the integral of f⁺ can be written as the sum of integrals over those intervals. So maybe the assumption here is that the domain of integration for f⁺ can be partitioned into these intervals. Since sin(x) is positive on [2πk, 2πk + π] for each integer k ≥ 1, and negative on [2πk + π, 2π(k+1)]. Therefore, the positive part is indeed the union of these intervals. Therefore, the integral over the positive part is the sum of integrals over each [2πk, 2πk + π]. So that's an assumption that the integral can be split into such a sum. However, in Lebesgue integration, if the sets are measurable and disjoint, then the integral over the union is the sum of the integrals. So the assumption here is that the intervals [2πk, 2πk + π] are measurable and disjoint, which they are. So perhaps the user is assuming that the integral over the union of these intervals can be expressed as the sum of the integrals, which is valid in Lebesgue integration. But the user is questioning whether this step is correct. So in the problem statement, perhaps we need to capture the user's question about this partitioning.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem, not the steps the user is questioning. The example had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, the original problem's assumptions would be the setup, not the steps taken in the solution. The user is working under the problem's conditions. So the problem is to show that sin(x)/x is not Lebesgue integrable on ℝ≥0. The user is approaching this by considering the integral of the positive part. The problem's assumptions would be the function definition and the context of Lebesgue integrability.\n\nSo, the original problem is about f(x) = sin(x)/x on ℝ≥0, and the task is to show it's not Lebesgue integrable. The user's specific questions are about steps in their approach. However, when structuring the problem according to the format, we need to extract the assumptions from the problem statement, not the user's solution steps. The problem as posed in the title is to show that sin(x)/x is not Lebesgue integrable on ℝ≥0. The user's questions are part of their attempt to solve that problem.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem had an expression A(n) and the formatted problem listed the assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which conflicts. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. Wait, maybe there was a mistake here, but perhaps the example was a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, maybe in the original example, the user made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem: assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe there was a confusion here. Perhaps the example is not correctly formatted. But regardless, according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem by listing the assumptions and then the problem. So in the current problem, the main problem is to show that sin(x)/x is not Lebesgue integrable on ℝ≥0. The user is working on this problem and has specific questions about their approach. However, the format requires that we present the problem as per the original question's assumptions, not the steps in the solution.\n\nWait, the example given by the user seems to have modified the original problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. So perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but according to their example, we have to list the assumptions, which may include implicit conditions. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user is instructing to follow the format where assumptions are all the problem's conditions. However, the example seems to have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated info, but in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. But perhaps there was a mistake in the example. However, regardless, we have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the user's title is: \"Showing sin x / x is NOT Lebesgue Integrable on ℝ≥0\". The question body includes defining f(x) = sin(x)/x on ℝ≥0, and discussing the integral of |f| and splitting into f+ and f-. The user's specific questions are about their approach, but the main problem is to show that sin(x)/x is not Lebesgue integrable. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include:\n\n1. f(x) = sin(x)/x is defined on ℝ≥0.\n2. The integral considered is the Lebesgue integral.\n3. The problem is to determine whether f is Lebesgue integrable, i.e., whether ∫ |f| dμ is finite.\n\nBut maybe the user's problem is structured as follows:\n\nAssumption: f(x) = sin(x)/x is defined on ℝ≥0.\n\nProblem: Show that f is not Lebesgue integrable on ℝ≥0.\n\nBut the user's specific questions are about steps in their proof, but the main problem is the title. However, the user might have intended to include the specific steps as part of the problem. But according to the example, the problem is restructured to list assumptions and then the problem. In the example, even though the original problem was for every integer n, the formatted problem included an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example had an error, but following the user's instruction, we need to extract assumptions from the original problem. The original problem here is to show that sin(x)/x is not Lebesgue integrable on ℝ≥0. The user's specific questions are about their method, but the main problem is the title. However, the user's own problem statement includes their attempt and specific questions about their approach, but according to the task, we need to structure the problem as per the original question, filtering out unrelated information. So perhaps the formatted problem should capture the main question (showing non-integrability) and list the assumptions from the problem setup.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = sin(x)/x is defined on ℝ≥0.\n- The integral considered is the Lebesgue integral over ℝ≥0.\n\nProblem: Show that f is not Lebesgue integrable on ℝ≥0.\n\nBut the user's specific questions are part of their solution attempt, but according to the task, we need to present the problem as per the original question. The user's problem on Math Stack Exchange has a title and a question body. The title is the main problem. The body includes their attempt and specific questions. But the task is to structure the problem, filtering unrelated information. So the main problem is the title: \"Showing sin x /x is NOT Lebesgue Integrable on ℝ≥0\". The rest is their solution attempt. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = sin(x)/x is defined on ℝ≥0,\nThe integral considered is the Lebesgue integral.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ is NOT Lebesgue integrable on $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$.\n\nBut the user's original question includes specific steps and questions (1) and (2). However, according to the user's example, they included the problem as stated, not the user's specific questions. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem was the same, with assumptions about n. However, in the current case, the user's problem includes two specific questions about their approach. But the task is to structure the problem as per the example. The example filtered out the original problem's details and presented assumptions and the problem. So perhaps we need to extract the main problem from the title and the setup, ignoring the user's specific questions (1) and (2), as those are part of their solution attempt. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to include their specific questions as part of the problem. Let me check the instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"Your task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example shows that the original problem's assumptions and the problem are separated. So the formatted problem includes the problem's assumptions and the problem statement. The user's specific questions (1) and (2) in their attempt are part of their solution process, not the original problem. Therefore, those are unrelated to the problem's structure and should be filtered out. Therefore, the formatted problem should be based on the title and the initial setup.\n\nThe original problem starts with: \"Let f(x) = sin(x)/x on ℝ≥0. ∫|f| < +∞ iff ∫f+ < ∞ ∧ ∫f− < ∞. So I'm trying to show that in fact ∫f+ = ∞ so that therefore ∫|f| = ∞.\" So the main problem is to show that ∫|f| is not finite, i.e., f is not Lebesgue integrable. The user's specific questions about partitioning the integral and the lower bound are their steps to solve it, but the main problem remains to show non-integrability.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = sin(x)/x is defined on ℝ≥0,\nThe integral considered is the Lebesgue integral.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ is NOT Lebesgue integrable on $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$.\n\nHowever, in the example, the user included additional assumptions (like n divisible by 7) that weren't in the original problem, but that might have been a mistake. Therefore, to be accurate, the assumptions should only include the given conditions. In this case, the function definition and the type of integral.\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem includes an edit where they mention they're trying to show ∫f+ is infinite, leading to ∫|f| being infinite. This could be part of the problem statement. However, the main problem is still to show non-integrability, and the approach via f+ is part of the solution. Therefore, the formatted problem should focus on the main assertion from the title: showing that sin(x)/x is not Lebesgue integrable on ℝ≥0.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ is defined on $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$,\nThe integral considered is the Lebesgue integral.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ is NOT Lebesgue integrable on $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were split into separate lines, each with one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$,\n$f$ is defined on $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$,\nThe integral considered is the Lebesgue integral.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $f$ is NOT Lebesgue integrable on $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$.\n\nAlternatively, combining the first two assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ is defined on $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$,\nThe integral considered is the Lebesgue integral.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $f$ is NOT Lebesgue integrable on $\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$.\n\nThis seems accurate. The user's specific questions about their method are part of their solution attempt and are not part of the problem's assumptions or statement. Therefore, they are filtered out as unrelated information.",
