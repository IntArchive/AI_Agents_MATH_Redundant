    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\gcd(a,b)=d$. Then for some $a_0,b_0$ such that $a_0$ and $b_0$ are relatively prime, we have $a=da_0$ and $b=d b_0$. If we can show that the lcm of $a$ and $b$ is $da_0b_0$, we will be finished. Certainly $da_0b_0$ is a common multiple of $a$ and $b$. We must show that it is the least common multiple. Let $m$ be a common multiple of $a$ and $b$. We will show that $da_0b_0$ divides $m$. Since $m$ is a multiple of $a$, we have $m=ka=ka_0d$ for some $k$. But $b$ divides $m$, so $db_0$ divides $ka_0d$, and therefore $b_0$ divides $ka_0$. Since $a_0$ and $b_0$ are relatively prime, it follows that $b_0$ divides $k$, and we are finished.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that gcd(a,b) multiplied by lcm(a,b) equals ab. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition on one line, applied to one object.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title mentions \"gcd (a,b) × lcm (a,b) =ab.\" The user is asking for both an understandable proof and a complex one involving advanced techniques. But according to the format, I need to extract assumptions and restate the problem.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, the theorem is general for integers a and b. So, what are the assumptions here? Well, typically, gcd and lcm are defined for integers, so probably the assumptions are that a and b are integers. Also, since gcd and lcm are involved, maybe they are positive integers? Because gcd is usually defined for positive integers, or non-negative, but if a or b is zero, the lcm might not be defined. So perhaps the standard theorem applies to positive integers.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a positive integer\n- b is a positive integer\n\nThen the problem is to prove that gcd(a,b) × lcm(a,b) = ab.\n\nWait, the example had two assumptions, but here, the original problem doesn't specify any restrictions beyond a and b being integers. But in reality, gcd and lcm are usually considered for positive integers. So maybe that's the key. Therefore, the assumptions should list that a and b are positive integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows a and b to be any integers, but gcd is defined as a positive integer, and lcm as well. But in some contexts, the theorem holds for non-negative integers. However, to be safe, the standard theorem is for positive integers. Therefore, the assumptions are a and b are positive integers.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive integer,\nb is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\gcd (a,b) \\times \\operatorname{lcm} (a,b) =ab$.\n\nThat seems to fit the format. The example had two assumptions, each on a separate line, each applying to one object. Here, a and b are separate objects each being positive integers. The problem is then stated clearly. I don't see any other assumptions needed here. The original question doesn't mention any specific conditions like divisibility or congruence, just the general theorem. So this should be correct.",
