    "Content": "Given two positive integers $a$ and $k>3$ : From experimental data, it appears the diophantine equation $(xz+1)(yz+1)=az^{k}+1$ has infinitely many solutions in positive integers $x,y, z$ . To motivate the question, it can easily be shown that if $k <3$ ,  the given diophantine equation has no solutions in positive integers $x, y ,z$ with $z>a$ . Proof: $(xz+1)(yz+1)=az^{k}+1$ may be simplified to $xyz^{2}+(x+y)z=az^{k}$ . If $k=1$ , this reduces to $xyz+x+y=a$ . Its clear that $a>z$ therefore there are no positive integral solutions in $x$ and $y$ when $z>a$ . if $k=2$ , we have the reduced equation $xyz+x+y=az$ . We have $z$ | $x+y$ , $z \\le(x+y) \\le xy$ .  Therefore $LHS=xyz+x+y>z^{2}$ . Because $RHS=az$ , we must have $a>z$ thus there are no solutions in positive integers $x ,y$ when $z>a$ . I would like to prove that given two positive integers $a$ and $k>3 $ , the diophantine equation $(xz+1)(yz+1)=az^{k}+1$ has  infinitely many positive integer solutions $x, y, z$ . I do not know how to start the proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This answer is based on the excellent work of Will Jagy. This solves all cases of $k>3.$ Let $p<k$ be an odd prime such that $p\\not\\mid k.$ Solve $kd\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}.$ Let $n=(kd+1)/p.$ Note that since $p<k,$ $n>d.$ Then for any integer $t,$ we can take $z=a^{d}t^p$ so that $$\\begin{align}az^k+1&=a^{kd+1}t^{kp}+1\\\\&=\\left(a^nt^k\\right)^p+1\\\\\n&=(a^nt^k+1)\\left(1+a^nt^k\\sum_{j=1}^{p-1} (-1)^j\\left(a^nt^k\\right)^{j-1}\\right)\n\\end{align}$$ Where the last equation is because when $p$ is odd, $$\n\\begin{align}u^p+1&=(u+1)\n\\sum_{j=0}^{p-1} (-1)^ju^j\n\\\\&=(u+1)\\left(1+u\\sum_{j=1}^{p-1}(-1)^ju^{j-1}\\right)\\end{align}$$ Now, since $n>d,$ we can set $$\n\\begin{align}x&=a^{n-d}t^{k-p}\\\\\ny&=a^{n-d}t^{k-p}\\sum_{j=1}^{p-1} (-1)^j\\left(a^nt^k\\right)^{j-1}\n\\end{align}$$ For $k\\geq 4$ we can always find such a $p$ by taking a prime factor of $n-1$ or $n-2$ if $n$ is even or odd, respectively. So this solves all cases $k>3.$ You don't need $p$ prime, just that $1<p<k$ is odd and $\\gcd(p,k)=1.$ k even So when $k$ is even, we can take $p=k-1.$ Then $d=p-1$ and $n=p.$ Then for any integer $t,$ $$\\begin{align}z&=a^{k-2}t^{k-1}\\\\x&=at\\\\y&=at\\sum_{j=1}^{k-2}(-1)^j\\left(a^{k-1}t^k\\right)^{j-1}.\\end{align}$$ k odd Likewise, if $k=2m+1$ is odd, then you can take $p=2m-1,$ $d=m-1$ and $n=m.$ Then for any integer $t$ : $$\\begin{align}z&=a^{m-1}t^{2m-1}\\\\\nx&=at^2\\\\\ny&=at^2\\sum_{j=1}^{2m-2}(-1)^j\\left(a^mt^{2m+1}\\right)^{j-1}\n\\end{align}$$ is a solution. In particular, for $k>3$ there are infinitely many solutions $(x,y,z)$ with $a\\mid x$ and $x\\mid y$ and $x\\mid z.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then clearly state the problem.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The diophantine equation is (xz + 1)(yz + 1) = a z^k + 1. The goal is to prove that for given positive integers a and k > 3, there are infinitely many positive integer solutions x, y, z.\n\nThe user mentioned that for k < 3, there are no solutions with z > a, but the main question is about k > 3. The assumptions here would be:\n\n1. a is a positive integer.\n2. k is an integer greater than 3.\n3. x, y, z are positive integers.\n4. The equation (xz + 1)(yz + 1) = a z^k + 1 must hold.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user specifies that a and k are given as positive integers with k > 3. So those are the conditions. Also, the solutions must be in positive integers x, y, z. The problem is to show there are infinitely many such solutions.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- a is a positive integer.\n- k is an integer greater than 3.\n- x, y, z are positive integers.\nBut wait, the problem says \"given two positive integers a and k > 3\", so a and k are given and fixed, and the equation has infinitely many solutions in x, y, z. So the assumptions for the problem are that a and k are given positive integers with k > 3, and we need to find x, y, z positive integers. But in the problem structure example, the assumptions list conditions on variables. Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem had n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in that case, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the variables are x, y, z, but a and k are parameters. So how to handle that?\n\nLooking at the example: The assumption was about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So in that case, the problem had variables (n) with certain conditions. Here, the variables are x, y, z, and the parameters are a and k. The problem says \"given two positive integers a and k > 3\", so those are part of the problem's conditions, not assumptions about variables. Wait, but the user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions would include that a is a positive integer, k is an integer greater than 3, and x, y, z are positive integers. But the problem is to show there are infinitely many solutions in x, y, z, so perhaps the variables are x, y, z, and the parameters are a and k. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a positive integer.\n\n- k is an integer greater than 3.\n\n- x, y, z are positive integers.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under these assumptions on a and k, there are infinitely many x, y, z. Hmm. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were about n (the variable in the problem), but here, the problem is about parameters a and k, and variables x, y, z. So perhaps the assumptions here would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- a is a positive integer.\n\n- k is an integer greater than 3.\n\n- x, y, z are positive integers.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that for these a and k, the equation has infinitely many solutions. Wait, but the user wants to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So each line should be about one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- a is a positive integer.\n\n- k is an integer.\n\n- k is greater than 3.\n\n- x is a positive integer.\n\n- y is a positive integer.\n\n- z is a positive integer.\n\nBut that seems a bit too granular. However, the example given by the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is one condition applied to one object. So here, similarly:\n\n- a is a positive integer.\n\n- k is an integer.\n\n- k > 3.\n\n- x is a positive integer.\n\n- y is a positive integer.\n\n- z is a positive integer.\n\nBut the problem is that the problem statement says \"given two positive integers a and k > 3\", so those are given parameters. The variables are x, y, z. So the assumptions would be on a, k, and the variables. But the user's example included assumptions on the variable (n). So in this problem, the parameters a and k are given with certain conditions, and the variables x, y, z must be positive integers. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- a is a positive integer.\n\n- k is an integer.\n\n- k is greater than 3.\n\n- x is a positive integer.\n\n- y is a positive integer.\n\n- z is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that the diophantine equation $(xz + 1)(yz + 1) = a z^k + 1$ has infinitely many solutions in positive integers x, y, z.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user also mentioned that for k <3, there are no solutions, but that's part of the motivation, not the assumptions for the current problem. The actual problem is when k >3, so the assumptions are a and k given as positive integers with k>3, and x,y,z positive integers. The problem is to show infinitely many solutions in x,y,z.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem as per the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So each line is an assumption. So yes, breaking down each condition into separate lines.",
