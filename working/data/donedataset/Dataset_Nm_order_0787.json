    "Content": "A subgroup generated by a set is defined as ( from Wikipedia ): More generally, if S is a subset of a group G, then , the subgroup\n  generated by S, is the smallest subgroup of G containing every element\n  of S, meaning the intersection over all subgroups containing the\n  elements of S; equivalently,  is the subgroup of all elements of G\n  that can be expressed as the finite product of elements in S and their\n  inverses. How does one prove that those statements are equivalent? If the answer is to broad to be presented here, I would appreciate pointers to relevant pages (or books). Thanks in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a typical top-down vs. bottom-up construction of a substructure. See the general discussion here . Let $S\\subseteq G$ . We let $$K = \\bigcap_{S\\subseteq M\\leq G}M$$ and $$H = \\Bigl\\{s_1^{\\epsilon_1}\\cdots s_m^{\\epsilon_m}\\mid m\\geq 0,\\ s_i\\in S,\\ \\epsilon_i\\in\\{1,-1\\}\\Bigr\\}.$$ We want to show that $K=H$ . Note that if $M$ is a subgroup of $G$ , and $S\\subseteq M$ , then every element of $H$ must be in $M$ , since $M$ is closed under products and inverses and contains every $s_i\\in S$ . Thus, $H\\subseteq K$ . Conversely, to prove $K\\subseteq H$ , it suffices to show that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ that contains $S$ . To see that $S\\subseteq H$ , let $s\\in S$ . Letting $m=1$ , $\\epsilon_1=1$ , and $s_1=s$ we have $s\\in H$ , so $S\\subseteq H$ . To see that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ , note that $H$ is nonempty: selecting $m=0$ we obtain the empty product, which by definition is the identity of $G$ . So $1\\in H$ . Let $s_1^{\\epsilon_1}\\cdots s_m^{\\epsilon_m}$ and $t_1^{\\eta_1}\\cdots t_n^{\\eta_n}$ , with $m,n\\geq 0$ , $\\epsilon_i,\\eta_j\\in\\{-1,1\\}$ , and $s_i,t_j\\in S$ be elements of $S$ . Then $$\\Bigl( s_1^{\\epsilon_1}\\cdots s_m^{\\epsilon_m}\\Bigr)\\Bigl(t_1^{\\eta_1}\\cdots t_n^{\\eta_n}\\Bigr)^{-1} = r_1^{\\chi_1}\\cdots r_{n+m}^{\\chi_{n+m}}$$ where $$\\begin{align*}\nr_i &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\ns_i &\\text{if }1\\leq i\\leq m\\\\\nt_{n+m-i+1} & \\text{if }m\\lt i\\leq n+m\n\\end{array}\\right.\\\\\n\\chi_i &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\epsilon_i &\\text{if }1\\leq i\\leq m\\\\\n-\\eta_{n+m-i+1} & \\text{if }m\\lt i\\leq n+m\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{align*}$$ Note that $r_i\\in S$ for each $i$ , and $\\chi_i\\in\\{1,-1\\}$ for each $i$ , so $r_1^{\\chi_1}\\cdots r_{n+m}^{\\chi_{n+m}}$ is an element of $H$ . Thus, $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ that contains $S$ , and so is one of the subgroups being intersected in the definition of $K$ . Hence, $K\\subseteq H$ . Since we already had $H\\subseteq K$ , it follows that $H=K$ , as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about proving that two definitions of a subgroup generated by a set are equivalent. The first definition is that it's the intersection of all subgroups containing the set S. The second is that it's the subgroup consisting of all finite products of elements from S and their inverses. They want to know how to prove these are equivalent or get pointers to resources.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem is about group theory, specifically subgroups generated by a set. The key elements here are:\n\n1. The group in question is G.\n2. S is a subset of G.\n3. The subgroup generated by S can be defined in two ways: as the intersection of all subgroups containing S, and as the set of finite products of elements from S and their inverses.\n\nEach assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break them down:\n\n- G is a group. (This is an assumption about the structure we're working within.)\n- S is a subset of G. (Specifies what S is in relation to G.)\n- The subgroup generated by S is the intersection of all subgroups of G containing S. (First definition.)\n- The subgroup generated by S is the set of all finite products of elements in S and their inverses. (Second definition.)\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show these two definitions are equivalent. So the assumptions should include the given structures (G is a group, S is a subset) and then the two characterizations of the generated subgroup. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the conditions on the variables (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about definitions, so maybe the assumptions are the basic structures and definitions given.\n\nBut the user is asking for a proof of equivalence between the two statements. So perhaps the assumptions are the necessary group-theoretic context. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that the two definitions are equivalent. Therefore, the assumptions would be the premises needed for these definitions. The key objects are G (a group), S (a subset of G), and the two characterizations of the subgroup generated by S. However, each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group.\n- S is a subset of G.\n- The subgroup generated by S is the intersection of all subgroups of G containing S.\n- The subgroup generated by S is the set of all elements expressible as finite products of elements of S and their inverses.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove these two are equivalent. So perhaps the assumptions are that G is a group and S is a subset, and then the problem is to show that the intersection of subgroups containing S is equal to the set of finite products of S and inverses.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were properties of the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is about definitions in group theory, so the assumptions would be the group axioms and the subset S. However, the user is not asking about specific groups, but the general case. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- S is a subset of G.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the two definitions of the subgroup generated by S are equivalent. The user is asking for a proof that these two statements are equivalent. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nS is a subset of G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the subgroup generated by S is equivalently defined as (1) the intersection of all subgroups of G containing S, and (2) the set of all elements of G that can be expressed as finite products of elements in S and their inverses.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem is to prove the equivalence of the two definitions. However, the original question mentions that if the answer is too broad, pointers would be appreciated. But the task is to structure the problem as per the format, not to answer it.\n\nThus, the key assumptions are that G is a group and S is a subset. The problem is to show the equivalence of the two definitions.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user is referencing the definitions from Wikipedia. So the two statements to prove equivalent are:\n\n1. The subgroup generated by S is the intersection of all subgroups of G containing S.\n\n2. The subgroup generated by S is the subgroup of all elements of G that can be expressed as the finite product of elements in S and their inverses.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that these two definitions are equivalent. The assumptions are that G is a group and S is a subset of G.\n\nBut perhaps more precise? Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is one line, one property.\n\nSo here, for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nS is a subset of G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the subgroup generated by S is equivalently the intersection of all subgroups containing S and the set of finite products of elements in S and their inverses.\n\nBut the user's question is how to prove that those statements (the two definitions) are equivalent. So the problem statement would be to show that the two definitions are equivalent.\n\nBut the problem field in the format is just the problem statement. So perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nProve that for a group G and subset S, the subgroup generated by S is both the intersection of all subgroups of G containing S and the set of all elements of G expressible as finite products of elements of S and their inverses.\n\nBut the original problem statement from the user is asking for the equivalence of the two definitions, so the problem is to prove that these two definitions are equivalent.\n\nThus, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nS is a subset of G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the following statements are equivalent:\n1. The subgroup generated by S is the intersection of all subgroups of G containing S.\n2. The subgroup generated by S is the set of all elements of G that can be expressed as finite products of elements in S and their inverses.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about equivalence of definitions, maybe the problem statement is phrased as proving that the two characterizations of the subgroup generated by S are equivalent.\n\nBut the user's original question is \"How does one prove that those statements are equivalent?\" So the problem is to prove that the two statements (definitions) are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions that G is a group and S is a subset, and the problem is to prove the equivalence of the two definitions.\n\nHence:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nG is a group,\nS is a subset of G.\nProblem: \nProve that the subgroup generated by S is equivalently defined as the intersection of all subgroups of G containing S and as the set of all elements of G expressible as finite products of elements in S and their inverses.\n###",
