    "Content": "Prove that all entire functions that are also injective take the form $f(z)=az+b$ with $a,b\\in\\Bbb C$ . Solution: We take $g : \\Bbb C^* \\to \\Bbb C$ , $g( z) = f(1/z)$ , which is holomorphic everywhere except the origin. Now, we try to find out what type of singularity is the origin for $g$ . If the origin is a removable singularity for $g$ , then $g$ is bounded on a closed disk centred at the origin, which implies that $f$ is bounded outside a closed circle containing the origin. But $f$ is bounded on this closed circle, because $f$ is continuous, therefore, $f$ is bounded. Since $f$ is entire and bounded, by Liouville's Theorem, $f$ is constant. This contradicts the injectivity of $f$ . So the origin is not a removable singularity for $g$ . Suppose now that $0$ is an essential singularity for $g$ . Then, by Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem, if we chose a punctured disk centred at the origin $D^*$ , then $g ( D^*)$ is dense in $\\Bbb C$ . This implies $f (\\{ \\lvert z\\lvert > r\\})$ is dense in $\\Bbb C$ . But $f (\\{ \\lvert z\\lvert < r\\})$ is open because any holomorphic mapping is an open mapping. Then $f (\\{ \\lvert z\\lvert > r\\})\\cap f (\\{ \\lvert z\\lvert < r\\})\\ne \\emptyset$ , which is again a contradiction with the injectivity of $f$ . Therefore $0$ is a pole for $g$ . Since the Laurent expansion is unique, and the principal part of $g$ is the same as the analytic part of $f$ , it follows that the analytic part of $f$ has finitely many terms, which implies that $f$ is a polynomial. Since $f$ is injective, the polynomial can have at most one root. Because $f$ is not constant, we conclude that the only expression of $f$ can be of the form $f ( z ) = az + b$ , where $a, b \\in \\Bbb C$ and $a \\ne 0$ . Original text image I'm a little confused at both the overall logic in this proof. Are we simply using $g(z)$ to make conclusions about $f(z)$ , because $g(z)$ is the reciprocal of $f$ ? Is the proof assuming that $f$ is injective and entire (all the while knowing that it has some sort of singularity at $z = 0$ ), and then trying to reach contradictions in the essential singularity and removable singularity cases? Then, once it concludes that $z = 0$ is a pole singularity, it reaches the conclusion that $f$ must be of the form $f(z) = az + b$ ? Also, more specific questions about the different cases: Removable singularity case: Why is $f$ bounded on the closed circle if $f$ is continuous? Am I missing something simple? Essential singularity case: Why exactly is $f(\\{|z| > r \\} \\cap f(\\{|z|<r\\}) \\neq \\emptyset$ ? $f(\\{|z| > r \\})$ is dense, but how does $f(\\{|z|<r\\}$ being open guarantee that their union is non-empty?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The first part of what you say is right; that's what the author is trying to do. For the other 2 specific questions. 1. $f$ is bounded because the closed circle is a compact set and $f$ is continuous. 2.Because the set $f(\\{|z|<r\\})$ is open it means that there is some ball inside $f(\\{|z|<r\\})$ that only takes points from $f(\\{|z|<r\\})$ ; now because Cassorati-Weierstrass assures you that $f(\\{|z| > r \\}$ is dense in all $\\mathbb{C}$ , it must have some point inside that ball, thus the intersection, $f(\\{|z| > r \\} \\cap f(\\{|z|<r\\})$ is non-empty.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and the user's confusion. The original problem is to prove that all entire and injective functions must be linear, i.e., of the form f(z) = az + b. The provided proof uses the function g(z) = f(1/z) and analyzes the singularity at z=0 (which corresponds to the behavior of f(z) as z approaches infinity). \n\nFirst, the user is confused about the overall structure of the proof. The proof seems to consider different types of singularities (removable, essential, pole) for g(z) at 0 and shows contradictions in the first two cases, leaving the pole as the only possibility. Then, from g having a pole, they conclude f is a polynomial, which must be linear due to injectivity.\n\nThe user's specific questions are:\n\n1. How does the removable singularity case lead to f being bounded? The argument is that if 0 is a removable singularity for g, then g is bounded near 0, which means f(1/z) is bounded when |z| is small (i.e., |1/z| is large). So f is bounded outside some large disk. But since f is entire (hence continuous), it's also bounded on the closed disk (compact set), making f bounded everywhere. Liouville's theorem then says f is constant, contradicting injectivity.\n\n2. In the essential singularity case, Casorati-Weierstrass says the image of any neighborhood of 0 under g is dense in C. Translating back to f, this means f(|z| > r) is dense. But f(|z| < r) is open because non-constant holomorphic functions are open mappings. Since dense sets intersect every non-empty open set, the intersection of f(|z| > r) and f(|z| < r) must be non-empty, contradicting injectivity since f would map some point inside the disk and some outside to the same value.\n\nThe user is also asking about the structure: using g(z) to analyze f's behavior at infinity, assuming f is injective and entire, then ruling out removable and essential singularities, leaving pole. Then f is a polynomial, and injective polynomials must be linear.\n\nSo to format the problem according to the given example, the assumptions would include that f is entire, injective, and we analyze g(z) = f(1/z). But in the problem statement, the user wants the problem to be structured with assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property of one object. Then the problem is to prove f(z) = az + b.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- f is entire (holomorphic on C)\n- f is injective\n- g(z) = f(1/z) is defined on C*\n- Then analyze the singularity type at 0 for g(z), leading to contradictions unless it's a pole.\n\nBut in the problem statement to be formatted, the original problem is to prove that all entire injective functions are linear. The assumptions would be f is entire and injective. The problem is to show f must be linear. The example given in the user's initial example had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the key assumptions are f is entire and injective.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an entire function,\nf is injective.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f takes the form f(z) = az + b where a, b ∈ C and a ≠ 0.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property per line. The original problem states \"all entire and injective functions take the form...\", so the assumptions are f is entire and injective. The problem is to prove the form. The rest of the text in the original question is the user's confusion about the proof steps, but according to the task, I need to filter out the unrelated info (the user's specific questions about the proof) and structure the problem as per the example. So the main problem is to prove that entire injective functions are linear, with assumptions being entire and injective.",
