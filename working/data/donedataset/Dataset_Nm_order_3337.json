    "Content": "I hope this is not a duplicate. First of all, in what follows I'm not allowed (unfortunately) to use the structure theorem for abelian groups. I'm asked to prove the following: Let $G$ be an abelian group with $\\vert G\\vert =mn$ and $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Prove that $G$ is $H\\times K$ with $H,K\\leq G$, $\\vert H\\vert =m$ and $\\vert K\\vert =n$. There's a hint: consider $G^{m}:=\\{g^{m}\\in G:\\ g\\in G\\}$ and $G^n$ analogously defined. Well, $G^m$ and $G^n$ are subgroups of $G$ because they are the images under the maps $g\\mapsto g^m$ and $g\\mapsto g^n$ from $G$ to $G$ and such functions are homomorphisms because $G$ is abelian. By the fact that $$o(g^m)=\\dfrac{o(g)}{\\gcd (o(g),m)}$$ (where $o(g)$ denotes the order of $g$) and using $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, I easily get that $G^m\\cap G^n$ is trivial. It is also easy to show that $G^m G^n=G$, writing $1=um+vn$ for some $u,v\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Since $G$ is abelian, both subgroups are normal and I get $G^m \\times G^n\\cong G$. The question is: \"How do I show that $\\{\\vert G^m\\vert,\\ \\vert G^n\\vert\\}=\\{m,n\\}$?\"\nI tried to look at the kernel of, say, $g\\mapsto g^m$ which is the set of all elements of $G$ whose order divides $m$ and noticed that $G^{n}\\subseteq \\ker (g\\mapsto g^m)$ but I can't go any further. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You already showed that $G^mG^n=G$, which implies that $|G^n|\\cdot|G^m|\\geq G$, and that $G^n$ is contained in the kernel of the morphism $g\\to g^m$ whose image is $G^m$, which implies that $|G^n|\\cdot|G^m|\\leq G$. So in fact $|G^n|\\cdot|G^m|=G$. But $|G_n|$ must also be relatively prime with $n$ (or its elements could not be in that kernel), and we must have $|G^n|=m$ and then $|G^m|=n$. I'll add that what makes this all look a bit tricky is that the statement is not sufficiently general. The more general fact is that for relatively prime integers $m,n$ any Abelian group $G$ annihilated by (taking the power) $mn$ is the direct sum of its subgroups annihilated respectively by $m$ and by $n$. This is immediate from a Bezout relation $1=um+vn$: on one hand any $g=g^{um}g^{vn}$ is in the product of those subgroups, and on the other hand should it be in both at the same time then each of the factors $g^{um}$ and $g^{vn}$ is separately the identity, so $g$ is as well. The order of the subgroup annihilated by $m$ retains all prime factors of $|G|$ that divide $m$ (with there multiplicities) and the rest (those prime factors that divide $n$) goes into the order of the other subgroup.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is trying to prove that if G is an abelian group of order mn where m and n are coprime, then G is the direct product of two subgroups H and K with orders m and n respectively. They mentioned using subgroups G^m and G^n, which are the images of the homomorphisms g ↦ g^m and g ↦ g^n. They already showed that G^m and G^n intersect trivially and generate G, so G is isomorphic to their direct product. The remaining part is to show that the orders of G^m and G^n are m and n (in some order). \n\nThe user tried looking at the kernel of the map g ↦ g^m, which is the set of elements with order dividing m. They noted that G^n is contained in this kernel but can't proceed further. \n\nNow, to structure this problem using the specified format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement should then be the core question.\n\nFirst, the original problem states that G is an abelian group with |G| = mn, gcd(m,n)=1. The goal is to prove G is H×K with H,K subgroups of orders m and n. \n\nThe user's specific question is about showing that the orders of G^m and G^n are exactly m and n. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include all necessary conditions given in the problem and any established facts they’ve already proven. From the original problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is an abelian group.\n- The order of G is mn, where m and n are integers.\n- gcd(m, n) = 1.\n- G^m and G^n are subgroups of G (since G is abelian, the maps g ↦ g^m and g ↦ g^n are homomorphisms).\n- G^m ∩ G^n is trivial.\n- G^m G^n = G (since 1 = um + vn for some integers u, v, leading to G being the product of these subgroups).\n- G is isomorphic to G^m × G^n (because they are normal subgroups in abelian G, with trivial intersection and product G).\n\nThe problem is then to show that the orders of G^m and G^n are m and n. The user phrased it as showing {|G^m|, |G^n|} = {m, n}.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption: G is an abelian group.\nAssumption: The order of G is mn, where m and n are integers.\nAssumption: gcd(m, n) = 1.\nAssumption: G^m is the image of the homomorphism g ↦ g^m.\nAssumption: G^n is the image of the homomorphism g ↦ g^n.\nAssumption: G^m and G^n are subgroups of G.\nAssumption: G^m ∩ G^n is trivial.\nAssumption: G^m G^n = G.\nProblem: Prove that { |G^m|, |G^n| } = { m, n }.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions applied to one object each. For instance, the original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, similarly, each property related to G, m, n, G^m, G^n needs to be separate.\n\nBut the user's specific problem is after establishing that G is isomorphic to G^m × G^n, they need to show the orders of these subgroups are m and n. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n- G is abelian.\n- |G| = mn.\n- gcd(m,n)=1.\n- G^m and G^n are subgroups with trivial intersection and product G.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that the orders of these subgroups are m and n. So in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: G is an abelian group.\nAssumption: The order of G is mn with gcd(m, n) = 1.\nAssumption: G^m and G^n are subgroups of G.\nAssumption: G^m ∩ G^n is trivial.\nAssumption: G^m G^n = G.\nProblem: Prove that { |G^m|, |G^n| } = { m, n }.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user had already established that G is isomorphic to G^m × G^n. So the missing step is just showing their orders are m and n. The user is stuck here, so the problem to present is precisely that. So the assumptions are all the given conditions and what's already proven, and the problem is to show the orders match m and n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that G is the direct product, but the user's specific question is within that proof, about the orders. However, the user's exact question is \"How do I show that { |G^m|, |G^n| } = {m,n}?\" So in the formatted problem, that's the problem part.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions include all the premises given and established facts up to that point. The user is working within the proof where they have already shown G is isomorphic to G^m × G^n, so the remaining part is to show the orders. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: G is an abelian group.\nAssumption: The order of G is mn, where m and n are positive integers.\nAssumption: gcd(m, n) = 1.\nAssumption: G^m is the image of the homomorphism g ↦ g^m.\nAssumption: G^n is the image of the homomorphism g ↦ g^n.\nAssumption: G^m ∩ G^n is trivial.\nAssumption: G = G^m G^n.\nProblem: Prove that the orders of G^m and G^n are m and n, respectively.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that the set { |G^m|, |G^n| } is equal to {m, n}. So they need to prove that one subgroup has order m and the other n. But since the product is G and their intersection is trivial, |G^m| * |G^n| = |G| = mn. Since m and n are coprime, it's necessary that |G^m| and |G^n| are m and n (in some order). However, the user is asking how to show this.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to note that since G^m and G^n have orders whose product is mn and are coprime (since m and n are coprime), then each must be m and n. Wait, but the orders of G^m and G^n may not necessarily be coprime. Hmm, maybe not. But since G^m × G^n is isomorphic to G, which has order mn, then |G^m| * |G^n| = mn. Also, since G^m ∩ G^n is trivial, by the product formula, |G^m G^n| = |G^m| * |G^n| / |G^m ∩ G^n| = |G^m| * |G^n|, which equals mn. Therefore, |G^m| * |G^n| = mn. Since m and n are coprime, the only possibilities for |G^m| and |G^n| are m and n. But this requires that each of |G^m| and |G^n| divide mn and are divisors such that they multiply to mn. But because m and n are coprime, the only pairs are (m,n) and (n,m). Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that these are indeed the orders.\n\nHowever, the user is looking for a way to show that. Maybe considering the exponents? Since G^m consists of all g^m for g in G. The kernel of the map g ↦ g^m is the set of elements with order dividing m. Then, by the first isomorphism theorem, G^m ≅ G / ker(φ), where φ is the map g ↦ g^m. Therefore, |G^m| = |G| / |ker(φ)| = mn / |ker(φ)|. Similarly, |G^n| = mn / |ker(ψ)| where ψ is g ↦ g^n.\n\nBut the user mentions that G^n is contained in ker(φ), since if x ∈ G^n, then x = h^n for some h ∈ G, so x^m = (h^n)^m = h^{mn} = (h^{|G|})^something, since |G|=mn, so by Lagrange's theorem, h^{mn} = e. Therefore, x^m = e, so x ∈ ker(φ). Therefore, G^n is a subgroup of ker(φ). Similarly, G^m is a subgroup of ker(ψ). But how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that since G is abelian, every element's order divides mn, and since m and n are coprime, the order of any element can be written as a product of primes dividing m and n. Then, considering the exponent of the group. But since the user cannot use the structure theorem, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since |G^m| * |G^n| = mn and gcd(m,n)=1, then |G^m| and |G^n| must be m and n. Because the product is mn and they must divide mn. But since m and n are coprime, the only divisors are products of divisors of m and divisors of n. Therefore, |G^m| and |G^n| must be m and n in some order. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that |G^m| and |G^n| multiply to mn, which they already have, and hence { |G^m|, |G^n| } = {m, n}.\n\nBut maybe the user needs to formalize this. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions are all the given conditions and the problem is to show the orders are m and n. Therefore, the correct structure would be:\n\nAssumption: G is an abelian group.\nAssumption: The order of G is mn, where m and n are positive integers.\nAssumption: gcd(m, n) = 1.\nAssumption: G^m and G^n are subgroups of G.\nAssumption: G^m ∩ G^n is the trivial subgroup.\nAssumption: G = G^m G^n.\nProblem: Prove that { |G^m|, |G^n| } = { m, n }.\n\nYes, this seems to capture the necessary assumptions and the specific problem the user is asking about.",
