    "Content": "I am trying to show that $C[0,1],$ the space of all real - valued continuous functions  with the sup metric is not sequentially compact with the sup metric by showing that the sequence $f_n = x^n$ has no convergent subsequence. The sup metric $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is defined as $$\\|f - g \\| = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |f(x) - g(x)|$$ where $|\\cdot|$ is the ordinary Euclidean metric. Now I know that $f_n \\rightarrow f$ pointwise, where $$f = \\begin{cases} 0, & 0 \\leq x < 1 \\\\ 1, & x = 1.\\end{cases}$$ However $f \\notin C[0,1]$ so this means by theorem 7.12 of Baby Rudin that $f_n$ cannot converge to $f$ uniformly. However how does this tell me that no subsequence of $f_n$ can converge to something in $C[0,1]$? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is (more-or-less) a modification of the hint from t.b's comment . It suffices to show that any subsequence of $(f_n)$ is not Cauchy. (Since every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence.) To do this, notice that\n$$\\lVert f_{2n}-f_n \\rVert = \\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} (x^n - x^{2n}) = \\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} (x^n - (x^{n})^2) = \\sup_{t\\in[0,1]} (t-t^2)=\\frac14.$$\n(It is easy to find maximum of the quadratic function $f(t)=t-t^2=t(1-t)$.) In addition, if we use the monotonicity of the sequence $(f_n)$, we see that\n$$k\\ge 2n \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\lVert f_{k}-f_n \\rVert \\ge \\frac14.$$ Now, if we have any subsequence of $(f_n)$ then the above estimate shows that this subsequence is not Cauchy. For any given $k_0$ we can find $k'>k_0$ such that $n_{k'}>2n_{k_0}$ and $\\lVert f_{n_{k'}}-f_{n_{k_0}} \\rVert \\ge \\frac 14$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the space C[0,1] with the sup metric isn't sequentially compact by using the sequence f_n = x^n, which supposedly has no convergent subsequence. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and extract the assumptions and the problem statement as per the required format. The example given structures assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nLooking at the problem: The space is C[0,1], the set of real-valued continuous functions on [0,1] with the sup metric. The sequence given is f_n(x) = x^n. The user mentions that pointwise, f_n converges to a function f which is discontinuous (0 on [0,1) and 1 at x=1), hence not in C[0,1]. The user is confused why the non-uniform convergence implies that no subsequence can converge in C[0,1].\n\nAssumptions here would include: C[0,1] is the space of real-valued continuous functions on [0,1]; the metric is the sup metric; the sequence is f_n(x) = x^n; f_n converges pointwise to f, which is discontinuous; uniform convergence is equivalent to convergence in the sup metric; and that if a subsequence converged in C[0,1], it would have to converge uniformly.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions were specific. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the space, the metric, the sequence, and their properties.\n\nSo breaking down the problem's assumptions:\n\n1. The space considered is C[0,1], the set of all real-valued continuous functions on the interval [0,1].\n2. The metric on C[0,1] is the sup metric, defined as ||f - g|| = sup_{x in [0,1]} |f(x) - g(x)|.\n3. The sequence in question is f_n(x) = x^n for each n.\n4. The sequence f_n converges pointwise to the function f defined piecewise (0 on [0,1), 1 at x=1).\n5. The limit function f is not an element of C[0,1].\n6. Uniform convergence of a sequence in C[0,1] implies convergence in the sup metric, and vice versa.\n7. If a subsequence of f_n converges in the sup metric, its limit must be in C[0,1].\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem's context rather than explicit assumptions. The user is asking why the fact that f_n doesn't converge uniformly to f (since f isn't continuous) implies that no subsequence can converge in C[0,1]. So the key points are that any convergent subsequence in the sup metric would have to converge uniformly to a continuous function. However, the pointwise limit is f, which is discontinuous. If a subsequence converged uniformly, it would also converge pointwise to the same limit. But since the pointwise limit is f, which is not continuous, this leads to a contradiction. Hence, no such subsequence can exist.\n\nSo for the assumptions, we need to list each condition applied to one object. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\n- The space is $C[0,1]$, the set of real-valued continuous functions on $[0,1]$,\n- The metric on $C[0,1]$ is the sup metric $\\|f - g\\| = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |f(x) - g(x)|$,\n- The sequence $(f_n)$ is defined by $f_n(x) = x^n$ for each $n$,\n- The sequence $(f_n)$ converges pointwise to a function $f$ where $f(x) = 0$ for $x \\in [0,1)$ and $f(1) = 1$,\n- The function $f$ is not an element of $C[0,1]$,\n- Uniform convergence in $C[0,1]$ is equivalent to convergence in the sup metric.\n\nThen the problem is to show that the sequence $f_n$ has no convergent subsequence in $C[0,1]$ with the sup metric.\n\nBut the user's original problem statement was \"showing that the sequence f_n = x^n has no convergent subsequence.\" So the problem is: Prove that the sequence $(f_n)$ has no convergent subsequence in $C[0,1]$ with the sup metric.\n\nBut how to structure the assumptions? Let me check the example again. In the example, they included the assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the space, the metric, the sequence, and their properties. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo each bullet point should be one assumption. Let's list them:\n\n1. $C[0,1]$ is the space of all real-valued continuous functions on $[0,1]$.\n2. The metric on $C[0,1]$ is the sup metric defined by $\\|f - g\\| = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |f(x) - g(x)|$.\n3. The sequence $(f_n)$ is defined as $f_n(x) = x^n$ for each $n$.\n4. The sequence $(f_n)$ converges pointwise to a function $f$ where $f(x) = 0$ for $x \\in [0,1)$ and $f(1) = 1$.\n5. The function $f$ is not continuous on $[0,1]$.\n6. Uniform convergence in $C[0,1]$ is equivalent to convergence in the sup metric.\n\nThen the problem is: Show that the sequence $(f_n)$ has no convergent subsequence in $C[0,1]$ with the sup metric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of these are part of the problem's given information. For example, the user is starting from the problem that $C[0,1]$ with sup metric is not sequentially compact by showing $f_n = x^n$ has no convergent subsequence. So the problem is to prove that $f_n$ has no convergent subsequence in $C[0,1]$ under the sup metric. The assumptions would then include the definitions of the space, the metric, the sequence, and the pointwise limit not being in the space.\n\nBut the key assumption is that if a subsequence converges in the sup metric, its limit must be in $C[0,1]$ (since the space is equipped with the sup metric, convergence in the metric implies the limit is in the space). Wait, but actually, in metric spaces, if a sequence converges, the limit must be in the space. But here, the space is $C[0,1]$, so any limit under the sup metric must be in $C[0,1]$. But the pointwise limit is outside. However, convergence in sup norm implies pointwise convergence. Therefore, if a subsequence converges in sup norm to some g in C[0,1], then it must also converge pointwise to g. But the pointwise limit is f, which is not continuous. Therefore, the only possible limit is f, which is not in C[0,1], so no convergence in the sup metric.\n\nTherefore, the critical assumptions are:\n\n- The space is $C[0,1]$ with sup metric.\n- The sequence is $f_n(x) = x^n$.\n- $f_n$ converges pointwise to $f$, which is discontinuous.\n- Convergence in sup metric implies uniform convergence and thus pointwise convergence to the same limit.\n- Any convergent subsequence in $C[0,1]$ must converge to a function in $C[0,1]$.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- $C[0,1]$ is the space of real-valued continuous functions on $[0,1]$,\n- The metric on $C[0,1]$ is the sup metric $\\|f - g\\| = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |f(x) - g(x)|$,\n- The sequence $(f_n)$ is defined by $f_n(x) = x^n$ for each $n$,\n- The sequence $(f_n)$ converges pointwise to a function $f$ where $f(x) = 0$ for $x \\in [0,1)$ and $f(1) = 1$,\n- The function $f$ is not an element of $C[0,1]$,\n- If a subsequence of $(f_n)$ converges in the sup metric, its limit is in $C[0,1]$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence $(f_n)$ has no convergent subsequence in $C[0,1]$ with the sup metric.\n\nBut wait, is the last assumption necessary? Because in metric spaces, convergence implies the limit is in the space. So if we have a subsequence converging in the sup metric, then by definition the limit is in $C[0,1]$. Therefore, that's a property of metric spaces, so maybe it's not an assumption but a known fact. However, the user might not state it, but in the problem's context, it's essential.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are just the definitions of the space, the metric, the sequence, and the pointwise limit. The rest is part of the reasoning.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions. So for the problem, the user is assuming that $C[0,1]$ has the sup metric, the sequence is $f_n = x^n$, and that $f_n$ converges pointwise to a discontinuous function. The problem is to show no convergent subsequence exists in $C[0,1]$.\n\nBut perhaps to list all the necessary given conditions as assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- $C[0,1]$ is the space of real-valued continuous functions on $[0,1]$,\n- The metric on $C[0,1]$ is the sup metric $\\|f - g\\| = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} |f(x) - g(x)|$,\n- The sequence $(f_n)$ is defined by $f_n(x) = x^n$ for each $n$,\n- The sequence $(f_n)$ converges pointwise to a function $f$ where $f(x) = 0$ for $x \\in [0,1)$ and $f(1) = 1$,\n- The function $f$ is not continuous on $[0,1]$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence $(f_n)$ has no convergent subsequence in $C[0,1]$ with the sup metric.\n\nYes, this seems to capture the necessary assumptions. Each line is a single condition on one object. The problem is to show no convergent subsequence. The fact that uniform convergence implies convergence in the sup metric is part of the general knowledge (since the sup metric is the uniform metric), but perhaps it's an implicit assumption here. However, in the example, the assumptions were more about the specific conditions given in the problem. So I think the above list of assumptions is appropriate.",
