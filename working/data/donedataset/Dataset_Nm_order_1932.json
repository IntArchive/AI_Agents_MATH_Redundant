    "Content": "I don't quite remember where this problem is from. I came across is sometime last summer, when I was in an olympiad-problem mood and I decided to improve my inequality skills. Suppose $a,b,c > 0$. Then we want to show that $$\\frac{16}{27} \\left( \\frac{a}{b+c} + \\frac{b}{a+c} +\\frac{c}{a+b} \\right) ^3 + \\left( \\frac{abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(a+c)}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\geq \\frac{5}{2}$$ I think that there are many things to notice. Firstly, it's homogenous. The left part is tantalizingly close to Nesbitt's inequality. The right part seems to demand AM-GM attention.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, make the substitutions\n$$\nx=\n\\frac{a}{b+c},\n\\quad\ny=\n\\frac{b}{a+c},\n\\quad\nz=\n\\frac{c}{a+b}.\n$$\nThe strategy will be to reduce the problem to an inequality in the single variable $t=(xyz)^{1/3}$. Note that $xy+yz+xz+2xyz=1$, and the inequality to be proved is\n$$\n\\frac{16}{27}\\left(x+y+z\\right)^3+(xyz)^{1/3}\\geq\\frac{5}{2}.\n$$\nNow\n$$\n\\frac{(x+y+z)^2}{3}\\geq xy+yz+xz=1-2xyz\n$$\nand also $x+y+z\\geq3/2$ by Nesbitt's inequality. Therefore,\n$$\n\\frac{16}{27}(x+y+z)^3=\\frac{16}{9}\\cdot(x+y+z)\\cdot\\frac{(x+y+z)^2}{3}\\geq\\frac{8}{3}(1-2xyz),\n$$\nand it is sufficient to prove the inequality\n$$\n\\frac{8}{3}(1-2xyz)+(xyz)^{1/3}\\geq\\frac{5}{2}.\n$$\nNow $xyz\\leq1/8$, because AM-GM gives\n$8abc\\leq (a+b)(b+c)(a+c)$ by grouping pairs on the right-hand side (e.g., $2abc\\leq a^2b+bc^2$). Thus by setting $t=(xyz)^{1/3}$, we are reduced to proving that the polynomial\n$$\nf(t):=\n8\\left(\\frac{1-2t^3}{3}\\right)+t-\\frac{5}{2}\n=\n\\frac{1}{6}+t-\\frac{16}{3}t^3.\n$$\nis nonnegative for $t\\in[0,1/2]$. Since $f(0)>0$ and $f(1/2)=0$, we can show that $f(c)>0$ whenever $c$ is a critical point of $f$. But $f'(t)=1-16t^2$, which has $c=1/4$ as its only zero in $[0,1/2]$. As $f(1/4)=4/12>0$, we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format the given problem according to their specified structure. The example they provided includes an \"Assumption\" section listing each condition line by line, followed by the \"Problem\" statement. \n\nLooking at the problem from Math Stack Exchange, the inequality involves variables a, b, c. The original question mentions that a, b, c are positive. Since the problem is an inequality, the key assumptions would be the positivity of each variable. The problem is to show that a certain expression involving these variables is at least 5/2.\n\nFirst, I need to list each assumption. The problem states \"Suppose a, b, c > 0.\" Each variable's positivity is a separate assumption. However, the example given for the previous problem listed each condition on separate lines, even if they apply to different objects. So here, since a, b, c are all positive, each should be listed as a separate assumption.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user wrote \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So each line is a separate condition, even if they apply to the same object. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions are three separate lines: a > 0, b > 0, c > 0.\n\nThe problem statement is the inequality itself. So the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as three separate lines, each stating that a, b, c are greater than 0, and then the problem is to prove the given inequality.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem mentions that it's homogenous, but that's part of the problem's nature, not an assumption. The user also mentions Nesbitt's inequality and AM-GM, but those are hints for solving it, not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo, the formatted assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\na > 0,\nb > 0,\nc > 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{16}{27} \\left( \\frac{a}{b+c} + \\frac{b}{a+c} +\\frac{c}{a+b} \\right) ^3 + \\left( \\frac{abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(a+c)}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\geq \\frac{5}{2}$$.\n\nI need to check if the LaTeX is correctly transcribed. The original has a typo in the denominator of the cube root term: it should be (a+b)(b+c)(a+c). The user's original input has \"(a+c)\" at the end, so it's correct. Also, ensuring that all parentheses are properly closed.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the assumptions are each variable being positive, listed separately, and the problem is the inequality as given.",
