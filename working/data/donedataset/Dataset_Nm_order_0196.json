    "Content": "Let $A$ be an $n\\times m$  matrix. Prove that $\\operatorname{rank} (A) = 1$ if and only if there exist column vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $A=vw^t$. Progress: I'm going back and forth between using the definitions of rank: $\\operatorname{rank} (A) = \\dim(\\operatorname{col}(A)) = \\dim(\\operatorname{row}(A))$ or using the rank theorem that says $ \\operatorname{rank}(A)+\\operatorname{nullity}(A) = m$. So in the second case I have to prove that $\\operatorname{nullity}(A)=m$-1",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hints: $A=\\mathbf v\\mathbf w^T\\implies\\operatorname{rank}A=1$ should be pretty easy to prove directly. Multiply a vector in $\\mathbb R^m$ by $A$ and see what you get. For the other direction, think about what $A$ does to the basis vectors of $\\mathbb R^m$ and what this means about the columns of $A$. Solution Suppose $A=\\mathbf v\\mathbf w^T$. If $\\mathbf u\\in\\mathbb R^m$, then $A\\mathbf u=\\mathbf v\\mathbf w^T\\mathbf u=(\\mathbf u\\cdot\\mathbf w)\\mathbf v$. Thus, $A$ maps every vector in $\\mathbb R^m$ to a scalar multiple of $\\mathbf v$, hence $\\operatorname{rank}A=\\dim\\operatorname{im}A=1$. Now, assume $\\operatorname{rank}A=1$. Then for all $\\mathbf u\\in\\mathbb R^m$, $A\\mathbf u=k\\mathbf v$ for some fixed $\\mathbf v\\in\\mathbb R^n$. In particular, this is true for the basis vectors of $\\mathbb R^m$, so every column of $A$ is a multiple of $\\mathbf v$. That is, $$\nA=\\pmatrix{w_1\\mathbf v & w_2\\mathbf v & \\cdots & w_m\\mathbf v}=\\mathbf v\\pmatrix{w_1&w_2&\\cdots&w_m}=\\mathbf v\\mathbf w^T.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. Let me read through it carefully. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, filter out unrelated info, and format the problem according to the given example. \n\nThe original question is titled \"A rank-one matrix is the product of two vectors\". The problem states: Let A be an n×m matrix. Prove that rank(A) = 1 if and only if there exist column vectors v ∈ ℝⁿ and w ∈ ℝᵐ such that A = vwᵗ. The user's progress mentions they're using definitions of rank and the rank theorem, but that's part of their attempt, which I should exclude.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. The problem is an \"if and only if\" statement, so both directions need to be considered. \n\nAssumptions would include:\n- A is an n×m matrix.\n- The rank of A is 1 (for one direction).\n- There exist column vectors v and w such that A = vwᵗ (for the other direction).\n\nBut wait, the problem is an equivalence, so technically, the assumptions for each direction are different. However, in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example: The problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is wrong, but I need to follow the user's format as instructed, even if the example has an error.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to filter out the necessary assumptions from the problem statement. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. The problem's conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory because the problem states \"for every integer n\", so n is given as any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So maybe the example has an error. But perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had additional conditions. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem in the example was not stated fully. Let me see. The original problem in the example is: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But this seems conflicting. If the problem is for every integer n, then the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is an extra condition, which would make the problem incorrect. Therefore, I suspect that the example might have a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions and their provided example format.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. The problem is to prove rank(A) =1 iff A=vwᵗ for vectors v and w.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is an n×m matrix.\n- rank(A) = 1 (for the forward direction)\n- There exist column vectors v ∈ ℝⁿ and w ∈ ℝᵐ such that A = vwᵗ (for the reverse direction)\n\nBut since it's an \"if and only if\", the problem has two parts. However, in the example, the original problem didn't split the assumptions for each direction but listed all assumptions. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption n is divisible by 7 might not be part of the problem but part of the solution. Maybe the example is wrong. But perhaps the user intended to list all given conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking at the example again:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\". The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But this is contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Therefore, the example's formatted problem seems to incorrectly add an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the original problem in the example had a typo, or the user made a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the user's format, which in the example includes assumptions that may not all be in the original problem.\n\nBut given that, how should I proceed with the current problem? The current problem is an \"if and only if\" statement. The original problem states: Let A be an n×m matrix. Prove that rank(A) =1 if and only if there exist vectors v and w such that A=vwᵗ. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- A is an n×m matrix.\n\nBut the problem is an equivalence. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list all the given conditions. The problem is to show that rank(A)=1 is equivalent to A being expressible as vwᵗ. Therefore, the only given condition is that A is an n×m matrix. The other conditions (rank=1 and existence of v,w) are part of the equivalence to be proven, not assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But in reality, the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, and the conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. The example's formatted problem seems to have added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which is not in the original problem, making it incorrect. This suggests that perhaps the user wants the assumptions to include both the given conditions and any hidden conditions necessary. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the original problem had a different wording. For instance, maybe the original problem was to prove that if n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But the user wrote it as \"for every integer n\", which conflicts. This confusion suggests that maybe the example has an error, but I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to prove that rank(A)=1 iff A=vwᵗ. The only given condition is that A is an n×m matrix. Therefore, the assumptions should list:\n\n- A is an n×m matrix.\n\nBecause that's the only condition given in the problem statement. The rank=1 and existence of v,w are part of the equivalence to be proven, not assumptions. However, in the example, they included the assumption about n being an integer (which is part of the problem's universal quantification) and an additional assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might have been part of the problem's hidden conditions. But this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's example is different. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this would mean that the original problem had a mistake, or the user rephrased it incorrectly. Because if n must be divisible by 7, then the original problem should state \"for every integer n divisible by 7\". But as written, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't include divisibility by 7. So the example's formatted problem added an extra assumption. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to list all necessary conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's statement. But this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to filter out the conditions from the problem statement. For example, in the original problem, \"for every integer n\" is a condition, so \"n is an integer\" is an assumption. Then, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, in the example, the formatted problem adds another assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. This seems contradictory. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the example, but I need to follow the user's instructions regardless.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the original problem states: Let A be an n×m matrix. Prove that rank(A)=1 if and only if there exist vectors v and w such that A=vwᵗ.\n\nFollowing the example's structure, the assumptions should include all given conditions. The problem states \"Let A be an n×m matrix\", so the assumption is that A is an n×m matrix. The rest is the problem to prove the equivalence. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is an n×m matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that rank(A) = 1 if and only if there exist column vectors v ∈ ℝⁿ and w ∈ ℝᵐ such that A = vwᵗ.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included both the universal condition (n is an integer) and an extra assumption (n divisible by 7), which wasn't in the original problem. This suggests that perhaps the user wants to break down all conditions, even those part of the problem's statement. However, in the current problem, the only given condition is that A is an n×m matrix. The rank and the existence of vectors are part of the equivalence to be proven. Therefore, the assumptions should only list that A is an n×m matrix.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's \"if and only if\" implies two separate assumptions for each direction. But in the example, the problem was a one-directional proof (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) with assumptions. The current problem is an equivalence, so maybe the assumptions should list the conditions for each direction. However, the example didn't split the assumptions for each direction. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to list all given assumptions upfront.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is an n×m matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that rank(A) = 1 if and only if there exist column vectors v ∈ ℝⁿ and w ∈ ℝᵐ such that A = vwᵗ.\n\nThis seems correct because the only given condition is that A is an n×m matrix. The rest is what needs to be proven.",
