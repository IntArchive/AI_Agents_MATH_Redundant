    "Content": "If $A$ and $B$ are square matrices, and $AB=I$ , then I think it is also true that $BA=I$ . In fact, this Wikipedia page says that this \"follows from the associativity of matrix multiplication\". I assume there's a nice simple one-line proof, but can't seem to find it. Nothing exotic, here -- assume that the matrices have finite size and their elements are real numbers. This isn't homework (if that matters to you). My last homework assignment was about 50 years ago.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $AB=I$ then $B=B(AB)=(BA)B$. Note from $AB=I$ that $1=\\det(AB)=\\det(A)\\det(B)$ so $\\det(B)\\neq0$. So by $(BA)B=B$ we have: $(BA-I)B=0$. Since $\\det(B)\\neq0$ then $B$ is not a $0$ divisor. So $BA=I$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that if two square matrices A and B satisfy AB = I, then BA = I as well. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The user mentioned that the matrices are square, so that's one assumption. The elements are real numbers, which is another. Then there's the condition that AB equals the identity matrix. The Wikipedia page mentioned associativity of matrix multiplication, so maybe the proof relies on that, but the user is asking for a simple one-line proof. The user also states it's not homework, but that's probably not an assumption needed for the problem itself.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"assume that the matrices have finite size and their elements are real numbers.\" So finite size (which is implied by being square matrices, but maybe specifying they are square is important) and elements are real. So the assumptions would be: A and B are square matrices, AB = I, elements are real. But wait, in linear algebra, the result that left inverse is also right inverse holds for square matrices over any field, not just real numbers. But the user specifically mentions real numbers, so that's part of the problem's conditions. So I need to list each assumption line by line. Each line should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n1. A is a square matrix.\n2. B is a square matrix.\n3. The elements of A and B are real numbers.\n4. AB equals the identity matrix.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"If A and B are square matrices, and AB = I\", so those are the conditions. The real numbers part is an additional assumption. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n- B is a square matrix.\n- The elements of A and B are real numbers.\n- AB = I.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that BA = I.\n\nBut maybe the part about elements being real is redundant because the result holds for matrices over any field, but the user wants to specify that. So according to the user's problem statement, the elements are real numbers. So that's an assumption.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nB is a square matrix,\nThe elements of A are real numbers,\nThe elements of B are real numbers,\nAB = I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that BA = I.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the user combined \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So each assumption line is one condition applied to one object. So here, \"A is a square matrix\" and \"B is a square matrix\" are separate. Similarly, elements of A and B being real numbers are separate, but maybe we can combine them as \"A and B have real number elements\" but the example shows each assumption line addresses one object. The original problem says \"assume that the matrices have finite size and their elements are real numbers.\" So \"finite size\" is covered by being square matrices. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nB is a square matrix,\nThe elements of A are real numbers,\nThe elements of B are real numbers,\nAB = I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that BA = I.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"A and B are square matrices with real entries\" can be split into two lines for A and B, but the example shows that each line addresses one property or condition for one object. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate lines. So following that, perhaps each matrix's properties are listed separately.\n\nBut the original problem states \"matrices have finite size and their elements are real numbers\". So \"finite size\" is equivalent to being square matrices here (since AB and BA need to be defined and equal to I, which requires same dimensions). So \"finite size\" is redundant if they are square. So the key assumptions are:\n\n- A and B are square matrices.\n\n- Elements are real numbers.\n\n- AB = I.\n\nSo translating into the assumption lines:\n\n1. A is a square matrix.\n2. B is a square matrix.\n3. The elements of A are real numbers.\n4. The elements of B are real numbers.\n5. AB = I.\n\nThen the problem is to prove BA = I.\n\nBut maybe the elements part can be combined since both matrices have real numbers. However, the example separates \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are both properties of n. So if the elements of A and B are real, perhaps it's two separate lines for each matrix's elements. Alternatively, if the user had said \"A and B have real entries\", that could be one line, but the original problem says \"their elements are real numbers\", referring to both matrices. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nB is a square matrix,\nElements of A and B are real numbers,\nAB = I.\n\nBut the example splits even properties of the same object into separate lines. So to follow the example's style strictly, perhaps each matrix's elements being real is a separate line. But the original problem states \"their elements are real numbers\" for both matrices. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are square matrices,\nElements of A are real numbers,\nElements of B are real numbers,\nAB = I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that BA = I.\n\nBut maybe \"A and B are square matrices\" can be split into two lines as per the example. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" So two separate lines for two properties of the same object. Similarly, here, A and B are two objects. So \"A is a square matrix\" and \"B is a square matrix\" would be two separate lines. Then \"Elements of A are real numbers\" and \"Elements of B are real numbers\" are two more lines. Then AB = I. So total five lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"A and B are square matrices\" as one line, and \"Elements of A and B are real numbers\" as another line. But the example shows that even for the same object, separate properties are separate lines. So if n has two properties, each is a line. Therefore, for A and B being square matrices, each should be a line. Similarly, their elements being real are two lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nB is a square matrix,\nElements of A are real numbers,\nElements of B are real numbers,\nAB = I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that BA = I.\n\nYes, this seems to follow the example's structure. Each assumption line addresses one property of one object. Even though A and B are both square matrices, each is listed separately. Similarly, their elements being real are separate lines. Then the condition AB = I is another line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be as above.",
