    "AcceptedAnswer": "Units are those elements in a ring that are invertible. Assume $a+bi$ is a unit. Then $\\exists\\ c+di \\in \\mathbb Z[i]$ such that $(a+bi)(c+di)=1$. This implies $$\\begin{cases}ac-bd=1\\\\bc+ad=0 \\end{cases}$$ Now solve this system and remember that $a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb Z$. We get from the second equation that $bc=-ad$. This means that, from the first equation, $$\\text{If $b \\neq0$, then,  } d(a^2+b^2)=-b.$$ This leaves you with two possibilities: $d=-1$ 0r $d=-b$. But, if $d=-b$ then, we have that $c=a$ and $a^2+b^2=1$. Now since we have been given that $b \\neq 0$ the only solution for $a^2+b^2=1$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb Z$ will be $a=0$ and $b=\\pm 1$. Now, if $d=-1$, then note that if $c=0$, we immediately have that $b=1$. More generally, the last equation we derived from the system gives you that, $b(1-b)=a^2$ which has no integral solutions if $b \\neq 0$. For the last case, if $b=0$, then, the Gaussian integer is just $a$ and $a$ has an inverse in $\\mathbb Z[i]$ iff $a=\\pm 1$. This is because, the multiplicative inverse is $\\frac{1}{a}$, which will be in $\\mathbb Z$ iff $a=\\pm 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let's see. The original question is about showing that ±1 and ±i are the only units in the Gaussian integers Z[i]. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's think about the problem. The ring in question is the Gaussian integers, which is Z[i]. The units are elements that have multiplicative inverses within the ring. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The ring is Z[i], which consists of all complex numbers a + bi where a and b are integers.\n2. A unit in a ring is an element that has a multiplicative inverse within that ring.\n3. We need to consider elements in Z[i] and determine which ones have inverses also in Z[i].\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that the only units are ±1 and ±i. So maybe the assumptions are the properties of the Gaussian integers and the definition of units. Let me check the example provided. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But here, the problem is about units in Z[i]. The problem statement is to prove that those four elements are the only units.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The ring under consideration is Z[i].\n- An element is a unit if there exists another element in the ring such that their product is 1.\n- The problem is to show that only ±1 and ±i satisfy this condition.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single property or condition. Let me break it down:\n\nAssumption 1: The ring is Z[i], the Gaussian integers.\n\nAssumption 2: A unit in a ring is an element with a multiplicative inverse in the ring.\n\nAssumption 3: The units must satisfy the equation that their product with another Gaussian integer equals 1.\n\nWait, but maybe more precise. Let me think again. The problem doesn't state any assumptions explicitly; the user is just asking how to show that those are the only units. So perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the definitions:\n\n1. The Gaussian integers are elements of the form a + bi where a, b are integers.\n2. A unit in a ring is an element that has a multiplicative inverse in the ring.\n3. The norm of a Gaussian integer a + bi is N(a + bi) = a² + b².\n4. The product of two Gaussian integers has a norm equal to the product of their norms.\n\nBut the user's example only included the necessary assumptions from the problem. The original problem in the example had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the current problem, the user is asking to show that ±1, ±i are the only units. The key here is to realize that units must have a norm of 1 because if u is a unit, then there exists v such that uv = 1, so N(u)N(v) = N(1) = 1. Since norms are non-negative integers, N(u) must be 1. Therefore, the units must satisfy a² + b² = 1, leading to the solutions ±1, ±i.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user didn't mention the norm, so perhaps the assumptions should include the definition of the norm? Or is that part of the problem's solution? The problem is asking to show the units are those elements, so the assumptions are just the definitions necessary to set up the problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The ring under consideration is Z[i], the Gaussian integers.\n- A unit in Z[i] is an element that has a multiplicative inverse in Z[i].\n\nBut maybe also that the norm is multiplicative? Wait, perhaps the problem expects using the norm to solve it. But in the example, the assumptions were given as part of the problem's conditions, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more about definitions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The ring is Z[i], which consists of elements a + bi where a and b are integers.\n\nAssumption: A unit in Z[i] is an element u such that there exists v ∈ Z[i] with uv = 1.\n\nBut each assumption must be a single line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring is Z[i].\nA unit in a ring has a multiplicative inverse in that ring.\nProblem: Show that ±1, ±i are the only units in Z[i].\n\nWait, but maybe the problem doesn't state that the ring is Z[i] as part of the problem; the user's question is about Z[i]. So in the formatted problem, the problem statement should include that the ring is Z[i], but the assumptions are the conditions. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, in that example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed it to n divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem becomes to prove it's divisible by 91. But the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, it's under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not what the original problem stated. That seems like a mistake in the example. Hmm, maybe that example is incorrect, but I should follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem: \"How can we show that ±1, ±i are the only units in the ring of Gaussian integers, Z[i]?\" The assumptions would be the properties needed. Since the problem is to show that those are the only units, the assumptions should include the definition of the ring and units. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring is Z[i], consisting of Gaussian integers a + bi with a, b ∈ Z.\nA unit in a ring is an element with a multiplicative inverse in the ring.\n\nProblem: Show that ±1 and ±i are the only units in Z[i].\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption line should address one property applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nZ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers.\nEach element of Z[i] is of the form a + bi where a and b are integers.\nA unit in Z[i] is an element that has a multiplicative inverse in Z[i].\n\nProblem: Show that the only units in Z[i] are ±1 and ±i.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to split each assumption into separate lines. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nZ[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers.\nEach Gaussian integer is of the form a + bi with a, b ∈ Z.\nA unit in a ring is an element with a multiplicative inverse in the ring.\n\nProblem: Show that ±1, ±i are the only units in Z[i].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that we are working within Z[i], and units are defined as elements with inverses. But perhaps the problem doesn't require listing all the definitions, but only the specific conditions. However, according to the example, even basic definitions like n being an integer were listed as assumptions. So I think the correct approach is to list the necessary definitions as assumptions.",
