    "Content": "Possible Duplicate: How do I convince someone that $1+1=2$ may not necessarily be true? I once read that some mathematicians provided a very length proof of $1+1=2$. Can you think of some way to extend mathematical rigor to present a long proof of that equation? I'm not asking for a proof, but rather for some outline what one would consider to make the derivation as long as possible. EDIT: It seems the proof I heard about is a standard reference given here multiple times :) I stated that the proof itself is less useful than an outline for me as I know only \"physics level maths\". Can someone provide a short outline what's going on in the proof? Some outline I can look up section by section in Wikipedia to at least get a feel of what could be needed to make such a proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are thinking of the Principia Mathematica , written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. Here is a relevant excerpt: As you can see, it ends with \"From this proposition it will follow, when arithmetical addition has been defined, that 1+1=2.\" The theorem above, $\\ast54\\cdot43$ , is already a couple of hundred pages into the book (Wikipedia says 370 or so) I wrote a blog article a few years ago that discusses this in some detail. You may want to skip the stuff at the beginning about the historical context of Principia Mathematica . But the main point of the article is to explain the theorem above. The article explains the idiosyncratic and mostly obsolete notation that Principia Mathematica uses, and how the proof works.  The theorem here  is essentially that if $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are disjoint sets with exactly one element each, then their union has exactly two elements.  This is  established based on very slightly simpler theorems, for example that if $\\alpha$ is the set that contains $x$ and nothing else, and $\\beta$ is the set that contains $y$ and nothing else, then $\\alpha \\cup \\beta$ contains two elements if and only if $x\\ne y$ . The main reason that it takes so long to get to $1+1=2$ is that Principia Mathematica starts from almost nothing, and works its way up in very tiny, incremental steps. The work of G. Peano shows that it's not hard to produce a useful set of axioms that can prove 1+1=2 much more easily than Whitehead and Russell do. The later theorem alluded to, that $1+1=2$ , appears in section $\\ast110$ :",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition on the objects involved, one per line, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem statement, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", which might not require n to be divisible by 7. Wait, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests maybe the example had some context where the divisibility by 7 was part of the problem's conditions. Hmm, maybe the original problem was edited or there was a mistake. But the key takeaway is that each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object.\n\nNow, the current problem to format is about proving 1+1=2. The original question mentions that some mathematicians provided a lengthy proof of this, referencing Principia Mathematica. The user wants an outline of what such a proof would involve, not the proof itself. But the task is to structure the problem into the Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. Since 1+1=2 is a fundamental arithmetic statement, the assumptions would relate to the definitions and axioms required. In Principia Mathematica, they build up from logic and set theory, defining numbers and operations. So assumptions might include the Peano axioms, the definition of addition, the definitions of numbers 1 and 2, etc. But each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nPossible assumptions could be:\n- The Peano axioms hold.\n- 1 is defined as the successor of 0.\n- 2 is defined as the successor of 1.\n- Addition is defined recursively.\n\nBut need to check if the original problem mentions any specific conditions. The original question doesn't list explicit assumptions; it's more about the meta-question of how such a proof is structured. However, since the task is to structure the problem as per the format, perhaps the assumptions here are the foundational axioms needed to even define 1, 2, and addition. Each of these would be separate assumptions.\n\nProblem statement: The user wants to know how to extend mathematical rigor to present a long proof of 1+1=2, asking for an outline of what such a proof would entail. The formatted problem should capture the essence of proving 1+1=2 under the given assumptions.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The Peano axioms are valid.\n- 1 is the successor of 0.\n- 2 is the successor of 1.\n- Addition is defined recursively as per Peano's formulation.\n\nProblem: Provide an outline of a rigorous proof that 1 + 1 = 2, detailing the necessary steps and foundational mathematical theories involved.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions that the user isn't asking for a proof but an outline of what would be needed. So the problem statement should reflect that. Let me check the example again. In the example, the problem was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem would be to \"Prove that 1 + 1 = 2\" but considering the user's request, they want the outline. However, the format requires the problem to be stated as a directive. Maybe the problem is \"Prove that 1 + 1 = 2 using foundational mathematical axioms,\" but the user's actual question is about outlining the steps. Hmm, but according to the instructions, the problem should be the original problem's main question. The original question's problem is \"Prove that 1+1=2\" but the user is asking for an outline of the proof's structure. However, the example shows that the problem is restated as the original problem's main directive. The example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was the same. So here, even though the user is asking for an outline, the formatted problem should be the core problem, which is proving 1+1=2. The user's actual question is about how to structure the proof, but the task is to extract the problem as per the example. Wait, the example took the original problem's main claim and formatted it as the problem statement, then listed assumptions. So in this case, the original problem's main claim is \"Prove that 1+1=2\", and the assumptions would be the underlying axioms needed. The user's actual question is more about the method, but according to the format, the problem is the mathematical statement to prove. So the formatted problem should be \"Prove that 1 + 1 = 2.\" Then the assumptions are the foundational axioms required. However, the original problem in the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That suggests that maybe there was a mistake in the example. But following the example's structure, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the foundational axioms needed. So each axiom or definition would be an assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Peano axioms hold.\n1 is defined as the successor of 0.\n2 is defined as the successor of 1.\nAddition is defined recursively.\n\nProblem: Prove that 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nBut the original question mentions that the user wants an outline of the proof's structure. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, not the meta-question. The format example took the problem's main claim as the \"Problem\" part. So even if the user is asking about the outline, the actual mathematical problem to be proven is 1+1=2. Therefore, the formatted problem should be \"Prove that 1 + 1 = 2.\" And the assumptions are the necessary foundational definitions and axioms. Each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Peano axioms are valid.\n1 is the successor of 0 in the Peano system.\n2 is the successor of 1 in the Peano system.\nAddition follows the recursive definition: \\(a + 0 = a\\) and \\(a + S(b) = S(a + b)\\).\n\nProblem: Prove that \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\nThis seems to fit the format. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object or definition. Then the problem is the statement to prove. The user's actual request for an outline is part of the original question but in the formatted problem, it's just the core problem statement. That makes sense based on the example provided.",
