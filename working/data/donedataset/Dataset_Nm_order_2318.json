    "Content": "I want to show that $${x^7-1 \\over x-1}=y^5-1$$ \ncannot have any integer solutions. The only observation I have made so far is that the left hand side is the $7$th cyclotomic polynomial \n$$\\Phi_7(x)= {x^7-1 \\over x-1}=x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+1$$ If I remember correctly cyclotomic polynomials are irreducible. Now can I use this property to arrive at the conclusion or should I try to approach by contradiction and assume $\\Phi_7(a)=b^5-1$ for some integers $a$ and $b$? The only problem is that I don't see where I would look for an easy contradiction. Any hints? Edit I also see that the right hand side can be factored as \n$$(y-1)(y^4+y^3+y^2+y+1)=(y-1)\\Phi_5(y)\\implies \\frac{\\Phi_7(x)}{\\Phi_5(y)}=y-1$$ which seems like it could give the result if we prove that the two cyclotomic polynomials have no common factors. How could this be done? Edit: This is IMO2006 Shortlised Problem N5 (RUS).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A start to solving this equation is to first prove that if $x$ is an integer and $p$ is a prime divisor of the left hand side $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}$ then either $p=7$ or $p \\equiv 1(\\mod{7})$. Proof: First notice by Fermat's little theorem that $x^{p-1}-1$ is divisible by $p$. Also by our hypothesis $x^{7}-1$ is divisible by $p$. Now suppose that $7$ does not divide $p-1$. Then $\\gcd(p-1,7) =1$, so there exists integers $a$ and $b$ such that $7a + (p-1)b = 1$. We subsequently see \n$$ x \\equiv x^{7a+(p-1)b} \\equiv (x^{7})^{a} \\cdot (x^{p-1})^{b} \\equiv 1 (\\mod p)$$\nand so then \n$$\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}= 1 + x + \\text{ ... } + x^{6} \\equiv 7 (\\mod p)$$\nSo we have that $p$ divides $7$, therefore $p=7$ must hold if we have that $p \\equiv 1(\\mod 7)$ does not, as we stated. $\\square$ We have now shown that every positive divisor of $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}$ meets either $d \\equiv 1(\\mod 7)$ or $d \\equiv 0$. Now assuming $(x,y)$ is some integer solution to our problem, we notice that $y-1>0$ since $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1} > 1 \\ \\forall  \\ x \\neq 1$. Then since $y-1$ divides $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1} = y^{5}-1$ we have $y \\equiv 1(\\mod 7)$ or $y \\equiv 2(\\mod 7)$. Evaluating $1+y+y^{2}+y^{3}+y^{4}$ in both possible cases will contradict the fact that our positive divisor $1+y+y^{2}+y^{3}+y^{4}$ of $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}$ is congruent to either $0$ or $1 (\\mod 7)$. Your result then follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, filter out the unnecessary information, and present the problem with clear assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original problem is to show that the equation (x⁷ - 1)/(x - 1) = y⁵ - 1 has no integer solutions. The user mentioned cyclotomic polynomials, specifically Φ₇(x) on the left side and factored the right side into (y - 1)Φ₅(y). They also noted that this was an IMO shortlisted problem.\n\nSo, the key elements here are the equation involving cyclotomic polynomials and the requirement that there are no integer solutions. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions would include that x and y are integers, since the problem is about integer solutions. Also, since the left side is Φ₇(x), which is defined as (x⁷ - 1)/(x - 1), we need to note that x ≠ 1 to avoid division by zero. The right side is y⁵ - 1, which can be factored into (y - 1)Φ₅(y). The problem is to show that this equation has no solutions in integers x and y.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't state any additional conditions like x or y being positive or negative, so the assumptions should just be that x and y are integers, x ≠ 1. Then the problem is to prove that the equation has no integer solutions. The user also mentioned cyclotomic polynomials and their irreducibility, but those are part of the approach, not the problem's assumptions. The problem's assumptions are the given conditions, not the methods to solve it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is an integer.\n- y is an integer.\n- x ≠ 1 (since denominator x - 1 can't be zero).\n\nThe problem is to prove that the equation (x⁷ - 1)/(x - 1) = y⁵ - 1 has no integer solutions.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. However, in this problem, there's no such explicit divisibility condition. The user in their original problem didn't add any extra conditions; they only mentioned that x and y are integers and x ≠ 1. So the assumptions are straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have three assumptions: x and y are integers, and x ≠ 1. The problem is to show the equation has no integer solutions.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For instance, if x = 1, the left side is undefined, so x ≠ 1 is necessary. The right side y⁵ - 1 is defined for any integer y. So yes, the three assumptions are correct.",
