    "Content": "This seemingly simple question has really stumped me: How do I prove that the largest integer that can't be represented with a non-negative linear combination of the integers $m, n$ is $mn - m - n$ , assuming $m,n$ are coprime? I got as far as this, but now I can't figure out where to go: $mx + ny = k$ , where $k = mn - m - n + c$ , for some $c > 0$ $\\Rightarrow m(x + 1) + n(y + 1) = mn + c$ If I could only prove this must have a non-negative solution for $x$ and $y$ , I'd be done... but I'm kind of stuck. Any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's an alternative (but perhaps more pedestrian) proof: (a) $mn-m-n$ is not a non-negative linear combination: Assume, to the contrary, that $mn-m-n=am+bn$ with $a,b\\in\\mathbb N_0$. Then\n$$(a+1)m+bn=mn-n=(m-1)n$$\n$$(a+1)m = (m-1-b)n$$\nBut $(a+1)m$ is clearly positive and since $(a+1)m < mn-n < mn$, it is a positive number less than $mn$ that is a multiple of both $m$ and $n$, contradicting the assumption that that $m$ and $n$ are coprime. (b) Every integer $k>mn-m-n$ is a non-negative linear combination. The $m$ numbers $0$, $n$, $2n$, ..., $(m-1)n$ represent all the different residue classes modulo $m$, so one of them must be congruent to $k$ modulo $m$. So $k=am+bn$ where $0\\le b<m$, and we need to check that $a$ is non-negative. However, if $a$ is negative, $am+bn$ can be at most $(m-1)n-m = mn-m-n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the largest integer that can't be represented as a non-negative linear combination of two coprime integers m and n is mn - m - n. They mentioned something about the equation mx + ny = k, where k is mn - m - n + c, and trying to show there's a non-negative solution for x and y when c > 0. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the assumptions. The problem states that m and n are coprime. That's a crucial point because the formula mn - m - n (the Frobenius number) specifically applies when m and n are coprime. So the main assumptions here are that m and n are coprime, and we're dealing with non-negative linear combinations. \n\nWait, in the original question, the user wrote \"assuming m,n are coprime,\" so that's definitely an assumption. Also, the problem is about representing integers as non-negative combinations, so the variables x and y must be non-negative integers. \n\nThe user's approach was to set k = mn - m - n + c and then rewrite the equation as m(x + 1) + n(y + 1) = mn + c. They want to show that for c > 0, this equation has a non-negative solution. That seems like a valid approach because if they can show that for any c > 0, there's a solution, then mn - m - n would indeed be the largest non-representable number.\n\nI need to make sure that the problem is structured correctly according to the format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So first, m and n are coprime. Second, the linear combination is non-negative, so x and y are non-negative integers. Maybe also that m and n are positive integers, but the problem statement might not specify that. However, since it's about representing integers as combinations, m and n are typically positive integers. But the user didn't mention that explicitly. Wait, the original problem says \"the integers m, n\" but in number theory, when discussing the Frobenius number, m and n are positive integers. However, the problem statement as given might not have specified positivity. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the original question: \"the largest integer that can't be represented as a non-negative linear combination of the integers m, n\". So m and n are integers, but non-negative linear combinations would require m and n to be positive, otherwise if m or n is negative, you could potentially represent all large integers. So maybe the problem implicitly assumes m and n are positive integers. But the user wrote \"assuming m,n are coprime\", but not necessarily positive. However, in the standard Frobenius number problem, m and n are positive coprime integers. So perhaps that's an assumption to include. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- m and n are positive integers.\n- m and n are coprime.\n- The linear combination is non-negative (i.e., x and y are non-negative integers).\n\nBut the problem as phrased by the user says \"the integers m, n are coprime\", but perhaps they meant positive integers. Since the problem is about non-negative combinations, m and n must be positive. Otherwise, if they were negative, the problem wouldn't make sense. So I should list those assumptions.\n\nBut wait, in the user's original problem statement, they didn't specify m and n are positive; they just said integers. However, in the context of the Frobenius problem, m and n are positive. So maybe that's an assumption that needs to be made explicit.\n\nSo, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should include that m and n are positive integers, coprime, and the linear combination is non-negative. Each of these should be separate points.\n\nLooking at the example given in the problem, the assumption for n was that it's an integer and then that it's divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So here, similarly:\n\nAssumption:\nm and n are positive integers,\nm and n are coprime,\nthe linear combination is non-negative (x and y are non-negative integers).\n\nWait, but the linear combination being non-negative is part of the problem statement, not an assumption on m and n. Maybe the problem's condition is that we consider non-negative combinations, so perhaps the assumption is that x and y are non-negative integers.\n\nBut the problem is to find the largest integer that can't be represented as such a combination. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- m and n are positive integers,\n- m and n are coprime,\n- x and y are non-negative integers.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is then to prove that the largest integer that can't be expressed as mx + ny is mn - m - n.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem as per the required format:\n\nAssumption:\nm and n are positive integers,\nm and n are coprime,\nx and y are non-negative integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the largest integer that can't be represented as a non-negative linear combination of m and n is mn - m - n.\n\nBut wait, in the original question, the user's problem statement says \"How do I prove that the largest integer that can't be represented with a non-negative linear combination of the integers m, n is mn - m - n, assuming m,n are coprime?\" So the user already mentions assuming m and n are coprime. However, the problem might require m and n to be positive as well, which is standard. So the assumptions should include m and n being positive, coprime integers, and x, y non-negative integers. But the problem statement in the user's question may not have specified positivity, but it's necessary for the Frobenius number. So I need to include that in assumptions.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nm and n are coprime,\nx is a non-negative integer,\ny is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the largest integer that cannot be represented as mx + ny is mn - m - n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine m and n being positive integers into one line? But the example had separate lines for each property of n. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were:\n\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nSo each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So here, m and n are each positive integers, so:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nm and n are coprime,\nx is a non-negative integer,\ny is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut perhaps m and n can be grouped as \"m and n are positive coprime integers\". But according to the example, each assumption is one property per line. So if the example had two lines for n (being integer and divisible by 7), then here, m and n being positive integers would be separate. Wait, but in the example, the first line was \"$n$ is an integer\", then \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each line is a single condition on a single object. Here, m and n are two different objects. So:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nm and n are coprime,\nx is a non-negative integer,\ny is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut perhaps \"x and y are non-negative integers\" can be two lines, but they are two different variables. However, in the example, the problem had variables x and y but the assumptions didn't mention them because the problem's conditions already specified that. Wait, the example problem was about A(n) defined with exponents, and the assumption was on n. So perhaps here, the problem's variables x and y are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Wait, the problem is about representing numbers as mx + ny with x, y non-negative integers, so the assumptions about x and y are part of the problem's conditions. Therefore, maybe the assumptions should only include conditions on m and n, since x and y are variables in the problem's statement. Wait, but the example had the assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which are conditions on the variable in the problem. So here, the problem's variables are m, n, x, y. But the user's problem is to prove the largest integer not expressible as mx + ny, given m and n are coprime. So the assumptions are on m and n: they are coprime, positive integers. The variables x and y are part of the problem's representation, so their non-negativity is part of the problem's statement. Therefore, maybe the assumptions only need to include that m and n are positive integers and coprime. The non-negativity of x and y is part of the problem's statement (i.e., the linear combination is non-negative), so perhaps that's not an assumption but part of the problem's phrasing. \n\nLooking back at the example, the problem was about A(n) = 5^n(...) -6^n(...), and the assumptions were n is an integer, and n divisible by 7. So the assumptions were about the variables in the problem (n), not parameters. In the current problem, m and n are parameters, and the problem is about integers k that can't be expressed as mx + ny. So the assumptions would be on m and n: they are positive integers, coprime. The variables x and y are part of the representation, so their non-negativity is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nm and n are coprime.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the largest integer that cannot be represented as a non-negative linear combination of m and n is mn - m - n.\n\nThat seems more in line with the example. The example didn't list assumptions about x and y in the problem statement, even though they were variables. Because in the example, the problem was about divisibility of A(n), so the assumptions were about n. Here, the problem is about m and n being coprime positive integers, leading to the conclusion about the largest non-representable integer. So the non-negativity of x and y is part of the problem's phrasing (\"non-negative linear combination\"), so it's in the problem statement, not the assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions are only on m and n: positive integers and coprime.\n\nSo, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a positive integer,\nn is a positive integer,\nm and n are coprime.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the largest integer that cannot be represented as a non-negative linear combination of m and n is mn - m - n.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The example from the user had two assumptions on n (being integer and divisible by 7), here we have three assumptions: m positive integer, n positive integer, and coprime. Each on separate lines.",
