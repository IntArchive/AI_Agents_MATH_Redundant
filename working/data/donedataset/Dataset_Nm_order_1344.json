    "Content": "A function $T:V \\rightarrow W$ is additive if $T(x+y) = T(x) + T(y)$ for every $x, y \\in V$. Prove that there exists an additive function $T: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that is not linear. My attempt: Let $T$ be the function $T: \\mathbb{R}$ (over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$) $\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ (over the field $\\mathbb{R}$). The set $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is linearly independent for the vector space $\\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Then, there must exist a linearly independent set $W \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ (over $\\mathbb{Q}$) such that $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\} \\subseteq W \\subseteq \\text{span}(W) = \\mathbb{R}$ (over $\\mathbb{Q}$). I have been told that the function defined as $T(1) = 1$ and $T(w) = 0$ for all $w \\in \\text{span}(W) \\setminus \\{1\\}$ is additive but not linear, but I cannot see why this is? I can see why it is not linear, clearly $T(\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 1) = 0$ but $\\sqrt{2} T(1) = \\sqrt{2}$. But, why is $T$ additive? For example, $T(1+1) = T(2) =0$ but $T(1) + T(1) = 1+1 = 2$? Is there a mistake somewhere?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can indeed construct an additive, non-linear function $T:\\Bbb R\\to \\Bbb R$ (as vetor spaces over $\\Bbb R$, since additive maps of $\\Bbb Q$-vector spaces necessarily become linear automatically) by starting with what you have: $T(p) = p$ for $p\\in \\Bbb Q$, and $T(r) = 0$ for all $r$ with $r/\\sqrt2 \\in \\Bbb Q$. However, constructing it is not easy, and requires the so-called axiom of choice in order to be finalised. So, we start out with what we already have: some values that $T$ sends to themself, and some values that $T$ sends to $0$. By additivity, this forces $T$ to be defined for a slightly greater class of numbers, namely $T(p + q\\sqrt2) = p$, for all rational $p, q$. But we haven't defined $T$ for all real numbers yet.  Note that whatever else we define $T$ to be, it already cannot be linear. So we just build on it as best we can and ensure that it stays additive. We do this by picking a number for which $T$ isn't already defined, like $\\pi$ or $\\sqrt 3$ or $\\ln 2$ or $e$ or anything else. I'll pick $\\pi$ for now. We can make $T(\\pi)$ to be whatever we want it to be. I'll pick $3$ because I like $3$. By additivity, $T$ is now forcibly defined to be $T(p+q\\sqrt2+r\\pi) = p+3r$ for any rational $r$. However, we are not done definining $T$ yet; there are still many more real numbers to cover. And this is where the axiom of choice comes in: there is no finite way, or even countably infinite way to finalise this definition of $T$. We just have to keep going and going, picking one new real number each step, until we've covered the entire real number line, which requires an uncountably infinite number of steps. The axiom of choice is exactly what allow us to say that even though we cannot finalise our $T$, some finalised $T$ does indeed exist somewhere out there.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the question. The original problem is about proving the existence of an additive function T: R → R that's not linear. The user also mentions their attempt involving vector spaces over Q and R, and a specific function T defined on a basis.\n\nLooking at the problem statement, the key assumptions would be related to the properties of the function T. The function is additive, meaning T(x+y) = T(x) + T(y) for all x, y in R. The goal is to show such a function exists that isn't linear, which in this context means it doesn't satisfy T(ax) = aT(x) for all a in R (since linearity over R would require this, but here they're considering R as a vector space over Q, so scalar multiplication is by rationals). \n\nWait, the user's attempt mentions that T is defined on a basis of R over Q. So the assumptions here would include that R is a vector space over Q, which allows for the existence of a basis (by the axiom of choice). The function T is constructed by assigning values on this basis and extending linearly over Q. However, since the basis is infinite, this extension is possible but might not be linear over R.\n\nThe user's confusion arises because when they take T(1 + 1), according to their definition, if 2 is in the span of W excluding 1, then T(2) = 0, but T(1) + T(1) = 2. This seems contradictory. The mistake here might be in how the basis is chosen. If W is a basis, then every element of R can be uniquely expressed as a finite linear combination of basis elements with rational coefficients. So 1 and √2 are part of the basis, hence 2 is 1+1, but since 1 is a basis element, 2 isn't in the span of W \\ {1} unless 2 is a multiple of 1, which it is over Q (2 = 2*1). Wait, but in the definition given, T is 1 on 1 and 0 on other basis elements. So when you write 2 as 2*1, then T(2) should be 2*T(1) = 2*1 = 2, but according to the user's T definition, they said T(w) = 0 for all w in span(W)\\{1}. Wait, that might be the confusion. The function isn't defined as 0 on span(W)\\{1}, but rather on the basis elements other than 1. Because in a vector space over Q, the basis elements are linearly independent, and every real number is a unique finite combination of basis elements. So if 1 is a basis element, then any multiple of 1 (like 2*1, 3*1, etc.) would be in the span of {1}, and the other basis elements (like √2) are separate. Therefore, the function T is defined as T(1) = 1, and for any other basis element w ≠ 1, T(w) = 0. Then, when you extend T additively, T of any finite linear combination would be the sum of the coefficients times T of the basis elements. So for example, T(2*1) = 2*T(1) = 2. However, the user's example of T(1+1) = T(2) = 0 must be incorrect under this correct definition. The mistake in the user's reasoning is probably in how the function T is defined. If W is a basis containing 1 and √2, then 2 is 2*1, so T(2) would be 2*T(1) = 2, not 0. Therefore, the user's example where T(1+1) = 0 is wrong, indicating they might have misdefined the function. The correct way would be to define T on the basis elements, setting T(1) = 1 and T(w) = 0 for all other basis elements w ≠ 1. Then, any real number x can be expressed as a finite sum q_1*1 + q_2*w_2 + ... + q_n*w_n where q_i are rationals and w_i are other basis elements. Then T(x) = q_1*1 + q_2*0 + ... + q_n*0 = q_1. This function is additive over Q-linear combinations but not R-linear because, for example, T(√2*1) would be T(√2) = 0 (since √2 is a basis element, so T(√2) = 0), but √2*T(1) = √2*1 = √2 ≠ 0. Therefore, T is additive but not linear over R. But the user's confusion arises from thinking that T(2) would be 0, which would only happen if 2 were expressed using basis elements other than 1, which isn't the case. Hence, their error is in the definition of T, possibly misunderstanding how the basis works. So the key assumptions are the properties of T being additive, the vector space structure over Q, the existence of a basis (via axiom of choice), and the specific definition of T on that basis leading to additivity but not linearity over R.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove the existence of such a function T.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include:\n\n- T: R → R is additive (i.e., T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) for all x, y ∈ R).\n\n- R is considered as a vector space over the field Q.\n\n- There exists a basis W of R over Q (which requires the Axiom of Choice).\n\n- The basis W contains elements 1 and √2, among others.\n\n- T is defined on the basis W with T(1) = 1 and T(w) = 0 for all w ∈ W \\ {1}.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that such a T exists and is additive but not linear.\n\nBut the original problem just asks to prove existence, so maybe the assumptions are more about the conditions given in the problem. Wait, the problem as stated in the title is: \"Prove the existence of an additive function T: R → R that is not linear.\"\n\nSo the user's question is about constructing such a T. The assumptions would be:\n\n- T is additive (so satisfies T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)).\n\n- The function T is not linear, meaning it is not of the form T(x) = kx for some constant k ∈ R.\n\nBut to construct such a T, we need to use the vector space structure over Q. So the key assumptions are that R is a vector space over Q, allowing for a basis (Hamel basis), and defining T on that basis. Therefore, the structured problem should capture these elements.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". However, in the example, the user might have made a mistake, but the correct assumptions should be as per the problem. Wait, the original example had a problem where the user's formatted version added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, but perhaps that was a mistake. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem under \"assumption\" listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include divisibility by 7. The example might have been a bad one. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, the assumptions should be derived directly from the problem, not from the user's attempt.\n\nBut the user's question includes their attempt and confusion. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated information. The original problem is: Prove that there exists an additive function T: R → R that is not linear. The user's attempt involves constructing such a function using a Hamel basis. Therefore, the key assumptions for the problem are:\n\n- T is additive: T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) for all x, y ∈ R.\n\n- The real numbers R can be considered as a vector space over the rationals Q.\n\n- There exists a basis W for R over Q (Hamel basis), which requires the Axiom of Choice.\n\n- The function T is defined on this basis and extended linearly over Q.\n\nBut to fit the format, each assumption should be one line, one property per object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- T: R → R is a function.\n- T is additive: T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) for all x, y ∈ R.\n- R is a vector space over Q.\n- There exists a Q-vector space basis W of R.\n- T is defined on W such that T(w) = 0 for some w ∈ W and T(1) = 1.\n- The function T is extended Q-linearly to all of R.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention the vector space structure; the user's attempt does. The original problem is just to prove existence, so the assumptions are inherent to the problem. However, the construction method using a Hamel basis is a standard approach here, which relies on R being a Q-vector space with a basis. Therefore, the necessary assumptions would include that R is a vector space over Q and the existence of a basis (Hamel basis), which is necessary for defining such a function. But the problem itself doesn't state these as given; they are part of the solution method. Therefore, maybe the formatted problem should only include the explicit assumptions given in the problem statement, which are:\n\n- T: R → R is additive.\n\n- T is not linear.\n\nBut the problem is to prove existence, so the assumptions would be the conditions that allow such a T to exist. Since the problem doesn't state any restrictions beyond T being additive and not linear, perhaps the formatted problem's assumptions are just:\n\n- T: R → R is additive.\n\n- T is not linear.\n\nBut that seems redundant because the problem is to prove that such a T exists. Wait, the example given in the user's query had assumptions that were possibly incorrect. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That might have been a mistake. Therefore, in our case, the correct approach is to list the assumptions that are given in the problem statement. But the problem statement here is: \"Prove that there exists an additive function T: R → R that is not linear.\" So the only explicit assumption is that T is additive and T is not linear. But existence is to be proven, so perhaps the assumptions are the properties that T must satisfy, i.e., T is additive and T is not linear. However, the standard approach to this problem involves using a Hamel basis and defining T on that basis, which requires R to be a Q-vector space and the Axiom of Choice to get the basis. Therefore, maybe the assumptions should include that R is a vector space over Q and the existence of a basis, but those are part of the mathematical framework rather than explicit assumptions in the problem statement. \n\nGiven that the user is asking to structure the problem by filtering unrelated information, and the original problem is as stated, the formatted problem should probably have:\n\nAssumption:\n- T: R → R is additive (i.e., T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) for all x, y ∈ R).\n- T is not linear (i.e., there exists a scalar a ∈ R and x ∈ R such that T(ax) ≠ aT(x)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an additive function T: R → R that is not linear.\n\nBut this seems redundant because the problem is to prove existence, so the assumptions would be the conditions that must hold for T, which are additivity and non-linearity. However, the standard answer uses the vector space structure over Q. Therefore, maybe the key assumptions are the ones necessary for the construction, even if they're not explicitly stated in the problem. Since the problem doesn't specify the method, but the user's attempt refers to the vector space over Q, perhaps the structured problem should include those as assumptions. However, the example provided by the user included assumptions that weren't in the original problem (like n divisible by 7 in the example), which was a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list only the assumptions given in the problem statement. But the problem statement here doesn't give any explicit assumptions beyond the existence of such a function with additivity and non-linearity. Hence, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- T: R → R is additive.\n- T is not linear.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a function T: R → R that is additive but not linear.\n\nHowever, this seems tautological. Alternatively, if the problem is to be structured according to the method used in the solution (as the user's attempt involves vector spaces over Q), then perhaps the assumptions should include the vector space structure. But since the problem itself doesn't mention that, maybe it's better to stick to the problem's original statement. The user's confusion comes from their specific construction attempt, but the formatted problem should abstract away the specific attempt and just present the core problem. Therefore, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- T: R → R is additive.\n- T is not linear.\n\nProblem:\nProve the existence of an additive function T: R → R that is not linear.\n\nBut the example given by the user in their initial message included assumptions from the problem (n is an integer, etc.), so maybe here the assumptions should capture the necessary conditions for the problem. However, the problem as stated doesn't have any explicit conditions beyond T being additive and not linear, which are the properties to be proven. Wait, actually, the problem is to prove existence, so the assumptions are the mathematical premises under which this existence holds. But in standard mathematics, such functions exist under the Axiom of Choice, but the problem doesn't mention that. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should include the necessary assumptions for the proof, like the existence of a Hamel basis, which requires the Axiom of Choice. But the problem statement doesn't mention this; it's part of the solution. Therefore, the formatted problem should reflect only what's in the problem statement. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$T: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is additive,\n$T$ is not linear.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an additive function $T: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that is not linear.",
