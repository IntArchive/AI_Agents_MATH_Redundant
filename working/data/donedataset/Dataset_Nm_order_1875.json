    "Content": "Let $p\\in(1,+\\infty)$ and consider the space $\\ell^p$ with its usual norm. The following are equivalent: (1) $x_n \\rightharpoonup x$ (i.e. $x_n$ weakly converges to $x$); (2) $$\\exists M>0: \\quad \\sup_{n} \\Vert x_n \\Vert_p \\le M \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad \\forall k\\in\\mathbb N: \\,\\,\\ x^{(k)}_n\\to x^{(k)}$$ I think I've proved (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) : indeed, every weak convergent sequence is bounded (hence we get $\\sup_{n} \\Vert x_n \\Vert_p \\le M$ for some positive $M$); on the other hand, we can simply observe that the \"projections\" $p_k \\colon \\ell^{p} \\to \\mathbb R$ definde by $x=(x_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mapsto x_k$ are linear and continuous. So, briefly, we have that weak convergence implies boundness and pointwise convergence. What about (2) $\\Rightarrow$ (1) ? I'm really puzzled and I don't know how to begin.\nThanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a more general result. Theorem. Let $E$ be a normed space. Let $\\{x_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}\\subset E$ and $x\\in E$, then the following conditions are equivalent: $\\{x_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ weakly converges to $x\\in E$ $\\{x_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ is bounded and for all $S\\subset E^*$ such that $\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{span} S)=E^*$ holds $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n)=f(x)$ for all $f\\in S$. Proof. Assume $\\{x_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ weakly converges to $x$. Then it is well knonw that $\\{x_n:\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ is bounded. Moreover for all $f\\in X^*$ we know that $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}f(x_n)=f(x)$. Hence for all $S\\subset X^*$ such that $\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{span}S)=X^*$ we have $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}f(x_n)=f(x)$ for all $f\\in S$. Assume that $\\{x_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ is bounded by some conatant $M>0$ and for all $S\\subset X^*$ such that $\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{span}S)=X^*$ holds $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}f(x_n)=f(x)$ for all $f\\in S$. Take arbitrary $g\\in\\mathrm{span}S$, then $g=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^m \\alpha_k f_k$. Then it is easy to check that $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}g(x_n)=g(x)$. So for all $g\\in\\mathrm{span}S$ we have $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}g(x_n)=g(x)$. Now take arbitrary $g\\in X^*=\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{span}S)$, then $g=\\lim\\limits_{k\\to\\infty} g_k$ for some $\\{g_k:k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}\\subset\\mathrm{span}S$. Fix arbitrary $\\varepsilon>0$. Since $g=\\lim\\limits_{k\\to\\infty} g_k$, then there exist $K\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\Vert g-g_k\\Vert\\leq\\varepsilon$ for all $k>K$. Then\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n|g(x_n)-g(x)|\n&\\leq|g(x_n)-g_k(x_n)|+|g_k(x_n)-g_k(x)|+|g_k(x)-g(x)|\\\\\n&\\leq\\Vert g-g_k\\Vert\\Vert x_n\\Vert+|g_k(x_n)-g_k(x)|+\\Vert g_k-g\\Vert\\Vert x\\Vert\\\\\n&\\leq\\varepsilon M+|g_k(x_n)-g_k(x)|+\\varepsilon\\Vert x\\Vert\n\\end{align}\n$$\nLet's take a limit $n\\to\\infty$ in this inequality, then\n$$\n\\limsup\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}|g(x_n)-g(x)|\\leq\n\\varepsilon M+\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}|g_k(x_n)-g_k(x)|+\\varepsilon\\Vert x\\Vert\n$$\nSince $g_k\\in\\mathrm{span}S$, then $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}|g_k(x_n)-g_k(x)|=0$ and we get\n$$\n\\limsup\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}|g(x_n)-g(x)|\\leq\n\\varepsilon M+\\varepsilon\\Vert x\\Vert\n$$\nSince $\\varepsilon>0$ is arbitrary we conclude $\\limsup\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}|g(x_n)-g(x)|=0$. This is equivalent to $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}|g(x_n)-g(x)|=0$ i.e. $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}g(x_n)=g(x)$. Since $g\\in X^*$ is arbitrary, then $\\{x_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ weakly converges to $x$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving the equivalence of two statements in the context of weak convergence in ℓ^p spaces. The original problem is from Math Stack Exchange, so I need to structure it according to the specified format.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem mentions that p is in (1, +∞), so that's one assumption about the space ℓ^p. Then, the two conditions (1) and (2) are part of the problem statement. The user is specifically focusing on proving (2) implies (1). The problem is about showing that if a sequence is bounded in norm and converges pointwise, then it converges weakly. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The space is ℓ^p with its usual norm.\n2. p is an element of (1, ∞).\n3. The sequence (x_n) is bounded in ℓ^p, i.e., sup_n ||x_n||_p ≤ M for some M > 0.\n4. For every k in ℕ, the k-th component sequence x_n^{(k)} converges to x^{(k)}.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, (x_n) weakly converges to x in ℓ^p. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, they mention that (1) and (2) are equivalent. However, the user has already handled (1)⇒(2) and is now asking about (2)⇒(1). So in structuring the problem, the assumptions should include the conditions given in (2), which are boundedness and pointwise convergence, and the conclusion is the weak convergence. The problem is to prove that (2) implies (1), given that p is in (1, ∞) and working in ℓ^p. \n\nSo breaking down the assumptions:\n\n- The space is ℓ^p with the usual norm.\n- p is in the interval (1, ∞).\n- The sequence (x_n) is bounded in ℓ^p, i.e., there exists M > 0 such that the supremum of the norms is ≤ M.\n- For each natural number k, the k-th component of x_n converges to the k-th component of x.\n\nThe problem is to show that under these conditions, x_n converges weakly to x in ℓ^p.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line and applies to one object. The first assumption is about the space, the second about p, the third about the sequence's boundedness, and the fourth about component-wise convergence. That seems to fit the required format.",
