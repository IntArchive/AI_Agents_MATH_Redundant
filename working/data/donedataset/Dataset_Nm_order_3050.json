    "AcceptedAnswer": "If prime $p\\ne 3,p$ can be written as $3k\\pm1$ where $k$ is a positive integer. So, $p^2+8=(3k\\pm1)^2+8=3(3k^2\\pm2k+3)$ is divisible by $3$ and $>3$ hence composite. So, we are left with only one prime value of $p,$ i..e, $3$ More generally, $p^2+3m-1$ is composite for any positive integers $m$ and $3\\not\\mid p$ When we have found $3$ can be only value of prime $p,$ we can have umpteen prime numbers like $p^3+4,p^3+10,p^3-2,\\cdots, p^4\\pm2,\\cdots $",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into their specified format. The example they provided includes listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is \"Why does $p^2+8$ prime imply $p^3+4$ prime\". The question asks how to prove that implication and about the general thought process for such problems.\n\nSo, the original problem is: If $p^2 + 8$ is prime, then prove that $p^3 + 4$ is also prime. The user wants to structure this into assumptions and the problem.\n\nNow, the assumptions. The key here is to list each assumption separately. The problem states that $p^2 + 8$ is prime. The variable $p$ is presumably a prime number because often in problems like this, especially involving primes, $p$ is considered a prime unless stated otherwise. But wait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that $p$ is prime. Wait, let me check again. The title says \"p^2+8 prime implies p^3+4 prime\". The question doesn't specify if p is a prime or any other condition. So, maybe I should check if there's an implicit assumption here.\n\nWait, but maybe in the problem statement, the user is assuming that p is a prime number. Because if p is not prime, then p^2 +8 being prime might have different implications. But the problem doesn't state that p is prime. Hmm. So, perhaps the original problem is missing some context. Wait, let's think again.\n\nLooking at similar problems, often when you have expressions like p^2 + something being prime, p is restricted to primes. For example, if p is even and greater than 2, then p^2 +8 would be even and greater than 2, hence not prime. So maybe p has to be an odd prime. Let me check possible cases.\n\nSuppose p is an integer. Then if p is even, p=2, then p^2+8=4+8=12, which is not prime. If p is any other even number, p^2 is even, so p^2+8 is even + even = even, which is divisible by 2, so unless it's 2, it's not prime. But p^2+8=2 implies p^2=-6, which is impossible. So the only even p to check is 2, which gives 12, not prime. Hence, if p^2 +8 is prime, p must be odd. But p could be 1. Let's check p=1: 1+8=9, which is not prime. So p must be an odd integer greater than 1. Wait, but maybe p is a prime number. Let's see.\n\nIf p is a prime number, then possible primes are 2, 3, 5, etc. For p=2: p^2+8=12, not prime. For p=3: 9+8=17, which is prime. Then p^3+4=27+4=31, which is prime. For p=5: 25+8=33, not prime. So p=3 is the case where p^2+8 is prime. Then p^3+4=31 is prime. So maybe the problem is that the only prime p for which p^2 +8 is prime is p=3, and in that case, p^3 +4 is prime. Hence, perhaps the problem assumes p is a prime number and p^2+8 is prime, then p must be 3, hence p^3 +4 is prime. But the problem is phrased as \"prove that p^2+8 prime implies p^3+4 prime\", which is a general implication. However, in reality, p^2 +8 can be prime only when p=3, so the implication is vacuously true except for p=3, but the problem might not state that p is a prime. Wait, but the original problem doesn't specify whether p is a prime. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Why does p^2+8 prime imply p^3+4 prime\". The user's question is how to prove that implication and the general thought process. So, the problem as stated is: If p is such that p^2 +8 is prime, then prove that p^3 +4 is prime. But to structure this into assumptions, we need to list all the assumptions.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem, the key assumption is that p is a prime number. Because if p is not prime, then even if p^2 +8 is prime, maybe p^3 +4 isn't. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that p is a prime. Let me check again. The problem says \"p^2 +8 prime implies p^3 +4 prime\". So, the problem is: For any integer p, if p^2 +8 is prime, then p^3 +4 is prime. But as I saw earlier, for p=3, p^2+8=17 (prime), p^3+4=31 (prime). For other primes like p=2, p^2+8=12 (not prime). p=5: p^2+8=33 (not prime). So, the only integer p where p^2+8 is prime is p=3. So, the implication is trivially true because the antecedent is only true for p=3, and the consequent is also true. But the problem is to show that implication holds. So, the assumption would be that p is an integer such that p^2 +8 is prime. But perhaps the original problem assumes that p is a prime number. Wait, maybe that's an implicit assumption. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original question is: \"How do I prove that p^2+8 prime implies that p^3+4 is prime? What is the general pattern of thought for these problems?\"\n\nSo, the problem is: If p is an integer (not necessarily prime) such that p^2 +8 is prime, then p^3 +4 is prime. But as we saw, p must be 3 in that case. So, the problem might have an implicit assumption that p is an integer, and the user wants to prove that whenever p^2 +8 is prime, then so is p^3 +4.\n\nBut in structuring the assumptions, the user wants each assumption to address only one property applied to one object. So, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. p is an integer.\n2. p^2 + 8 is a prime number.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that p^3 +4 is a prime number.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided earlier, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So, each assumption is a separate line. So, in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\np is an integer,\np² + 8 is prime.\n\nProblem:\nProve that p³ + 4 is prime.\n\nBut wait, but in reality, the only integer p for which p² +8 is prime is p=3. So, the problem reduces to showing that when p=3, p³ +4 is prime, which it is (31). But perhaps the original problem is expecting to show that for any p where p² +8 is prime, p must be 3, hence p³ +4 is prime. Therefore, the key step is to first find all integers p for which p² +8 is prime, and then show that for those p, p³ +4 is prime. So, the problem might involve two parts: first determining possible p, then proving the implication.\n\nBut according to the user's format, the assumptions are to be listed line by line, each addressing one property. So, the main assumptions here are that p is an integer and that p² +8 is prime. The problem is to prove that under these assumptions, p³ +4 is prime.\n\nSo, structuring the answer accordingly.",
