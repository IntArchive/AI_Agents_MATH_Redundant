    "Content": "Suppose you are inside a perfectly spherical mirror. You shoot one beam of light and it reflects on the walls of the mirror. Considering the intensity is constant will the beam of light hit you again? I can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere and I am a point. One answer mentions that the beam will always come arbitrarily close. How to prove this? I thought of this question while sleeping. But even after a day of thinking about this problem I couldn't solve it. Note The only answer is brief and does not explain or prove what is says. Looking for detailed answers preferably using illustration and valid mathematical proofs for the statements they make. Would like to read about possible generalizations and variations of this question. Please don;t restrict yourself to this specific situation and do not hesitate to write long answers which give a wide overview of these type problems. Bounty-awarded answer is likely to be long, detailed and self-sufficient mathematically in terms of proving the facts it states.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By the laws of optics, the reflections will occur in the plane formed by the initial ray and the center of the sphere, and this is a planar problem. Now consider the circle where you are standing and the successive intersection points of the reflected rays with it. By symmetry, these points will be located at angles that follow an arithmetic progression, and the angular delta from the initial point is $n\\alpha\\bmod1=\\{n\\alpha\\}$, where the angles are expressed in turns. Now it is clear that the ray will come back iff $\\alpha$ is a rational number. If it is irrational it will never come back exactly but you can always find an $n>0$ such that $\\{n\\alpha\\}<\\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon$. The situation is similar for the second intersection points with the ray, at angles $n\\alpha+\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is independent of $\\alpha$*. But then, it may turn out that $n\\alpha+\\beta$ is a integer by coincidence so that even with irrational $\\alpha$ there can be an exact return (only one because $n'\\alpha+\\beta$ cannot be another integer). To summarize : The return angles are $\\{n\\alpha\\}$ and $\\{n\\alpha+\\beta\\}$, corresponding to irrational $\\alpha\\to$ zero or one exact return plus infinitely many close ones, or rational $\\alpha\\to$ infinitely many exact periodic returns but no close ones. *As said somewhere else, the figure has two degrees of freedom: the (relative) distance to the center and the (relative) starting ray direction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem about the spherical mirror and the light beam according to the given format. Let me first parse the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is inside a perfectly spherical mirror. They shoot a light beam that reflects off the walls. The intensity is constant, so we don't have to worry about it diminishing. The main question is whether the beam will hit the user again. Also, the user mentions that an answer stated the beam comes arbitrarily close, and they want a proof of that. They also want generalizations and detailed explanations.\n\nBut the task here is to filter out the unrelated info and structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. The example given shows that assumptions are specific conditions, each applied to one object. Let me list possible assumptions:\n\n1. The mirror is perfectly spherical. So the shape is a sphere.\n2. The user is inside the mirror. So the mirror's inner surface is the sphere.\n3. The user is a point. So the person is a point object inside the sphere.\n4. The light beam is a single beam (ray) with constant intensity. But intensity might not be relevant for the trajectory. The problem is about the path, not intensity. So maybe the key assumption is that the light reflects according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection).\n5. The light reflects on the walls multiple times. Each reflection follows the law of reflection.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"will the beam of light hit you again?\" So the user is at a point inside the sphere, shoots a light beam, and after some reflections, does it return? The answer mentions coming arbitrarily close, so perhaps under certain conditions, it doesn't hit exactly but comes close. But the problem is to prove that it will come arbitrarily close, given that the user is a point inside the sphere.\n\nBut how to structure the assumptions. Let's see.\n\nAssumptions need to be each one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\n- The mirror is a perfect sphere. (So the reflecting surface is a sphere.)\n- The observer (you) is a point inside the sphere. (So the point is located somewhere inside the spherical mirror.)\n- The light beam is a ray emitted from a point inside the sphere. (Assumption about the beam's origin.)\n- The light reflects off the sphere's inner surface following the law of reflection. (Angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.)\n- The intensity of the light is constant. (But does this affect the path? Probably not, so maybe this is an extraneous detail. The user mentioned intensity is constant, but the problem is about the trajectory. So maybe this is not a necessary assumption. The example given in the problem about divisibility had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So similar here, the key assumptions are about the setup: spherical mirror, point observer, light follows reflection law. The intensity being constant might not affect whether the beam returns, so perhaps that's unnecessary. The user included it in the original problem, but maybe it's not needed for the mathematical formulation. So we should filter that out as unrelated.)\n\nProblem: Prove that the beam of light will come arbitrarily close to the observer (you) after some reflections, regardless of the initial position and direction of the beam.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"will the beam of light hit you again?\" but the answer mentions it comes arbitrarily close. So the problem as posed by the user is whether it hits again, but the answer says it comes arbitrarily close. So perhaps the problem needs to be phrased as proving that the beam comes arbitrarily close, given the initial conditions.\n\nBut the user wants the problem structured as per the example, which for the divisibility problem had assumptions and the problem statement. So in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example seems to have a different original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem changes it to an assumption that n is divisible by 7, and then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is showing that the user restructured the problem, perhaps to focus on a specific case where n is divisible by 7? Hmm, that might not be the best example, but perhaps the key is that each assumption is a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo applying that here: the mirror is a perfect sphere (assumption 1). The observer is a point inside (assumption 2). The light is a beam (ray) shot from a point inside (assumption 3). The reflections follow the law of reflection (angle in = angle out) (assumption 4). Then the problem is to prove that the beam will come arbitrarily close to the observer again, regardless of the initial position and direction.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"will the beam hit you again?\" but the answer says it comes arbitrarily close. So perhaps the problem is to prove that it comes arbitrarily close, not necessarily hits again. So the problem statement in the formatted problem should reflect that.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The mirror is a perfect sphere.\n- The observer is a point inside the sphere.\n- The light beam is a ray emitted from a point inside the sphere.\n- The light reflects off the sphere's inner surface with the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection.\n\nProblem: Prove that the beam of light will come arbitrarily close to the observer after some number of reflections, regardless of the initial position and direction of the beam.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"you can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere and I am a point.\" So the initial position can be anywhere inside. So the problem is to show that, regardless of starting point and direction, the beam comes arbitrarily close to the observer (the point) again. Or perhaps, comes arbitrarily close to the original point? Wait, the observer is at a fixed point, and the beam is shot from another point? Wait, the problem states \"you shoot one beam of light from anywhere inside the sphere and I am a point.\" Hmm, maybe the observer is at the same point from which the beam is emitted? Wait, the user says \"I can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere and I am a point.\" So the observer is a point inside the sphere, and the beam is shot from any point inside, but perhaps the observer's position is fixed, and the beam is shot from another point? Or is the beam emitted from the observer's position? The original question is a bit ambiguous. Let's re-read:\n\n\"Suppose you are inside a perfectly spherical mirror. You shoot one beam of light and it reflects on the walls of the mirror. Considering the intensity is constant will the beam of light hit you again? I can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere and I am a point.\"\n\nSo \"you\" are a point inside the sphere. You shoot the beam from your position (since \"I can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere and I am a point\"). Wait, if you are a point, and you shoot the beam from your position, then the beam starts at your location. But the problem says \"I can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere\", so perhaps the beam can start at any point inside, and the observer is also a point (possibly different). Wait, this is unclear. The problem states: \"I am a point. One answer mentions that the beam will always come arbitrarily close.\" So maybe the observer is a fixed point, and the beam is emitted from another point inside the sphere. But the problem is whether the beam, after reflections, will hit the observer again. However, the answer says it comes arbitrarily close. So the problem needs clarification. But since we need to structure the problem based on the given information, perhaps the key is:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The mirror is a perfect sphere.\n2. The observer (you) is a fixed point inside the sphere.\n3. The light beam is emitted from a point inside the sphere (possibly different from the observer's position).\n4. The light reflects off the sphere's inner surface following the law of reflection.\n5. The intensity of the light is constant (though this might not affect the path, but the user mentions it, so maybe include it? But the example excluded the intensity part. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example shows that the formatted problem can include additional assumptions not explicitly stated but inferred? Or maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So they added an assumption. That seems to be a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? But according to the user, the example is how they want the problem structured. So perhaps in this case, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added an assumption that n is an integer (which is redundant, as the original says \"for every integer n\") and n is divisible by 7, changing the problem. Wait, maybe the example is a wrong example. Anyway, maybe the user wants to extract the assumptions from the problem, even if they are redundant. But given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should include:\n\n- The mirror is a perfect sphere.\n\n- The observer is a point inside the sphere.\n\n- The light beam is emitted from a point inside the sphere.\n\n- The light reflects according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection).\n\nPossibly also that the light continues reflecting indefinitely (no absorption), which is implied by constant intensity. But maybe intensity being constant isn't necessary, but the problem states it. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The mirror is a perfect sphere.\n\n- The observer is a point located inside the sphere.\n\n- The light beam is a ray emitted from a point inside the sphere.\n\n- The light reflects off the sphere's inner surface with angle of incidence equal to angle of reflection.\n\n- The light maintains constant intensity (implying no energy loss, so reflections continue indefinitely).\n\nProblem: Prove that the light beam will come arbitrarily close to the observer after some number of reflections, regardless of the initial emission point and direction.\n\nAlternatively, if the beam is emitted from the observer's position (since \"you shoot it\"), then the problem is: starting from the observer's position, after reflecting, does it return? But the answer says it comes arbitrarily close. So in that case, the assumptions would include that the light is emitted from the observer's position (a point inside the sphere), and the problem is to prove that the beam comes arbitrarily close to the observer (its starting point) after reflections.\n\nBut the original problem says \"you can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere and I am a point.\" So the observer is a point, and the beam is shot from any point inside, not necessarily the observer's position. So the problem is: given any starting point inside the sphere and any direction, does the beam, upon reflecting off the sphere, eventually come arbitrarily close to the observer's fixed position?\n\nBut this is getting complicated. The key is to parse the original question accurately. The user says: \"You shoot one beam of light and it reflects on the walls of the mirror. Considering the intensity is constant will the beam of light hit you again? I can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere and I am a point.\"\n\nSo \"you\" are a point inside the sphere. You can shoot the beam from any point inside the sphere (not necessarily your location), and you are a point. The question is whether the beam will hit you (your location) again. The answer says it comes arbitrarily close. So the problem is: given a spherical mirror, you (a point inside), shoot a beam from any point inside in any direction. Prove that the beam will come arbitrarily close to your position after some reflections.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The mirror is a perfect sphere.\n\n- The observer (you) is a fixed point inside the sphere.\n\n- The light beam is emitted from a point inside the sphere (possibly different from the observer's position).\n\n- The light reflects off the sphere's inner surface following the law of reflection.\n\n- The light beam continues reflecting indefinitely (implied by constant intensity).\n\nProblem: Prove that, regardless of the beam's initial position and direction inside the sphere, the beam will come arbitrarily close to the observer (your position) after some number of reflections.\n\nAlternatively, if the beam is emitted from the observer's position, then the starting point is the observer's location. But the original question says \"I can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere\", so the beam can start at any point, not necessarily the observer's location. Therefore, the problem is general: starting anywhere inside, any direction, prove the beam approaches the observer's fixed point arbitrarily close.\n\nThis seems like a problem about billiard dynamics in a sphere. In billiards, the question is whether a trajectory comes arbitrarily close to a point. For planar billiards, certain conditions lead to dense trajectories. In a spherical mirror, the light reflects like a billiard ball. So the problem reduces to showing that the billiard trajectory in a sphere is dense, i.e., comes arbitrarily close to any point, including the observer's position.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The mirror is a perfect sphere.\n- The observer is a fixed point inside the sphere.\n- The light beam is a ray emitted from any point inside the sphere.\n- The light reflects off the sphere's inner surface with the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection.\n- The light beam reflects indefinitely without loss of intensity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the light beam will come arbitrarily close to the observer's position after some number of reflections, regardless of its initial position and direction inside the sphere.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem was about divisibility, and the formatted problem added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original. Wait, no, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but we should follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn this case, the original problem didn't state that the observer is fixed, but it's implied. The key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe mirror is a perfect sphere.\nThe observer is a fixed point inside the sphere.\nThe light beam is emitted from a point inside the sphere.\nThe light reflects off the sphere's inner surface with angle of incidence equal to angle of reflection.\nThe light beam reflects indefinitely without loss of intensity.\nProblem: \nProve that the light beam will come arbitrarily close to the observer's position after some number of reflections, regardless of its initial position and direction inside the sphere.",
