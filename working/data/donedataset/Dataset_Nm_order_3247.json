    "Content": "I'm working through Convex Optimization by Boyd, and want to check my answer to the above question. Is the following reasoning correct? Let $L$ be an arbitrary line. For $\\Rightarrow$: Case 1 : $C \\cap L = \\emptyset$ This is convex by definition. Case 2 :$C \\cap L \\neq  \\emptyset$ $x,y \\in C$ and $x,y \\in L \\implies \\lambda x + (1- \\lambda)y \\in C$ (by assumption) for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ Also, $\\lambda x + (1- \\lambda)y$ lies on the line segment between $x,y$, which is in $L$. For $\\Leftarrow$: I decided to try proof by contradiction: We are given that $C\\cap L$ is convex for all lines. Assume $C$ is not convex. Our assumption implies $\\exists x,y \\in C$ and $\\lambda_0\\in [0,1]: \\lambda_0 x + (1-\\lambda_0)y \\notin C$. However, the line formed by $ax+(1-a)y,\\;\\;a\\in \\mathbb{R}$ will have a nonempty intersection with $C$ and yet the resulting set will not be convex (i.e, it will not contain $\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y$). Hence, we must negate our assumption, which means that $C$ must be convex. I think this is correct as per this question: Poof- A function is convex iff it is convex when restricted to a any line that intersects its domain. I also justified it by noting that if we let $A$ be the proposition \"$C \\cap L$ is convex for all lines $L$\", and $B$ be the proposition \"$C$ is convex\" then what I showed was: $A \\wedge \\neg B \\implies \\neg A$ which is equivalent to: $\\neg (A \\wedge \\neg B) \\vee \\neg A$ which (via DeMorgan's Laws) is $\\neg A \\vee B$. This last statement can also be expressed $A \\implies B$, hence I think I've shown the converse.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "So your proof is correct, but a little confusing -- especially the second part. It's easier to do directly instead of via contradiction. A little simplification: $\\Leftarrow$ : Let $x,y\\in C$ and let $\\lambda\\in[0,1]$ . We wish to prove $\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y\\in C$ . Let $L$ be the line through $x$ and $y$ . $x$ and $y$ are in $C\\cap L$ . By convexity of $C\\cap L$ , we have that $\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y\\in C\\cap L$ and hence clearly $\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y\\in C$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving that a set C is convex if and only if its intersection with any line is convex. The original question includes their attempt and some logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the core problem from the user's detailed explanation. The main goal is to prove the equivalence: C is convex ⇨ C∩L is convex for every line L. The user provided their proof attempt, but I need to structure the problem by listing assumptions and stating the problem clearly.\n\nAssumptions would be the conditions given. The problem statement is the equivalence to prove. Let me check the example provided. In the example, assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about a set C and lines L. The key assumptions here are that C is a set in some real vector space, and L is any line. But wait, the problem is an equivalence, so both directions need to be considered. However, in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the main assumptions are about the definitions involved. But since it's a general proof, maybe the assumptions are more about the properties of convex sets and lines.\n\nWait, the problem is to show that C is convex if and only if for every line L, the intersection C∩L is convex. So the problem doesn't have additional conditions; the assumptions are inherent in the definitions. However, in the example, the user included the assumptions from the problem, like n being an integer. Here, perhaps the assumption is that C is a subset of Euclidean space (or a vector space), and lines are considered in that space. But the user might not have specified that. The original problem on Math Stack Exchange didn't mention the space, so maybe the assumption is just that C is a set in ℝⁿ. But the user didn't specify, so maybe we need to list that as an assumption.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So in this case, the problem is about a set C and lines L. The assumptions would be:\n\n- C is a subset of ℝⁿ (assuming Euclidean space, since convexity is usually discussed there)\n- L is a line in ℝⁿ\n- For all lines L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex\n\nBut wait, the problem is an equivalence. So in the forward direction (⇒), we assume C is convex and need to show C ∩ L is convex for any L. In the reverse (⇐), we assume C ∩ L is convex for any L and need to show C is convex. However, the problem as stated in the user's question is to prove the equivalence. So the problem statement is to prove that C is convex if and only if its intersection with every line is convex. Therefore, the assumptions would be the definitions involved, but maybe in the formatted problem, we need to list the conditions given in the problem. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- C is a set.\n- For every line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that C is convex ⇨ C ∩ L is convex for any L, and vice versa. Wait, but the problem as stated by the user is \"Proof that a set C is convex ⇨ its intersection with any line is convex\". The user's own problem statement is the equivalence. Therefore, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions would be the definitions of convexity and lines. However, the example's assumptions were specific to the problem's conditions. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user's problem didn't have additional conditions beyond the definitions. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are inherent in the problem's terms. However, according to the example format, each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. So here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- C is a set.\n- L is any line.\n- The intersection of C with any line L is convex.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem is to show that C is convex if and only if for every line L, C ∩ L is convex. So the problem is to prove an equivalence. So the \"if and only if\" means that both directions need to be proven. But when structuring the problem, the user's example included the assumptions from the problem. In the original example, the problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the user corrected it to remove the divisibility by 7 (since the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n). Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user structured it as assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, that might have been a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem in the example lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like an error because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. But perhaps the example given by the user was incorrect. However, I need to follow the format as instructed.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem: The user's problem is to prove that C is convex if and only if its intersection with any line is convex. The assumptions here would be the definitions:\n\n- A set C is convex if for any two points in C, the line segment between them is entirely in C.\n- A line L is a set of points of the form x + tv, where x is a point, v is a direction vector, and t is a real number.\n- The intersection of C with any line L is convex (for the reverse direction).\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed as individual conditions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- C is a set.\n- For any line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that C is convex if and only if this holds. So the problem is an equivalence, so the assumptions would depend on the direction. However, in the problem statement, the user wants to structure it as \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". The example shows that in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the given conditions. For example, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe the example had a mistake. But assuming the user's example is correct, then for the current problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. However, the problem is an equivalence, so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nFor the forward direction (⇒):\n- C is convex.\n- L is any line.\n\nFor the reverse direction (⇐):\n- For every line L, C ∩ L is convex.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the example format seems to combine both directions into one problem statement. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- C is a set.\n- L is any line.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that C is convex if and only if C ∩ L is convex for every line L.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not need to list assumptions beyond the inherent definitions, but according to the example, the user included specific conditions like n being an integer. So perhaps here, the assumption is that C is a set in Euclidean space, but the user didn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the only assumption is that C is a set, and lines are considered in the same space. But since the example included two assumptions for the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7), which were part of the problem's conditions, in this case, the problem's conditions are that C is a set and the intersections with lines are considered. However, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- C is a subset of a real vector space.\n- A line L is a one-dimensional affine subset of the vector space.\n\nBut I think the main point is to list the assumptions given in the problem. Since the problem is about proving the equivalence, the problem's assumptions are the definitions of convex sets and intersections with lines. But according to the example, the user extracted specific conditions from the problem. In this case, the problem's original statement is to prove that C is convex if and only if its intersection with any line is convex. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- C is a set.\n- For every line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nBut that's for the reverse direction. The forward direction assumes C is convex. However, the problem is an equivalence, so the problem statement encompasses both directions. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. However, since it's an equivalence, both directions are part of the problem. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- C is a set.\n- A line L is any one-dimensional affine subset of the space containing C.\n\nBut the example didn't list the definitions as assumptions. It listed specific conditions. Therefore, perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- C is a subset of a real vector space.\n- For every line L in the vector space, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nBut the problem is to show the equivalence. However, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was formatted as \"n is an integer\". Then the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, with an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake because the original problem's conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, which includes n not divisible by 7. The example's formatted problem seems to have added an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps there was an error in the example. Therefore, when applying the format, perhaps the assumptions should only include the conditions explicitly given in the problem, not those inferred.\n\nGiven that confusion, for the current problem, the user is to structure the problem as per the example. The original problem on Math Stack Exchange is about proving that a set C is convex if and only if its intersection with any line is convex. The user's attempt is included, but the task is to extract the problem into the Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFollowing the example's approach, even if the example might have had an error, the user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So the assumptions would be the key conditions given. The problem is to prove the equivalence. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- C is a set.\n- L is any line.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since the problem is about intersections with any line being convex, the assumptions would list:\n\n- For any line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nBut that is the conclusion in one direction. However, the problem is to show that this holds if and only if C is convex. Therefore, the problem is to prove that C is convex ⇨ C ∩ L is convex for any L, and conversely, if C ∩ L is convex for any L, then C is convex. So the formatted problem's assumptions would be the definitions necessary, but according to the example, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem is to prove the equivalence, the assumptions would include both directions' premises, but since it's an equivalence, they are part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- L is any line.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex if and only if its intersection with any line L is convex.\n\nBut the example's assumption listed specific properties applied to one object each. In the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single property of one object. Translating that to the current problem, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For every line L, the intersection C ∩ L is a convex set.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence, so actually, the problem is to show that C being convex is equivalent to C ∩ L being convex for every L. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the two directions as part of the problem statement. But according to the example, the problem is stated as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\". So here, the problem would be \"Prove that C is convex if and only if its intersection with any line is convex.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. However, in the original problem, the user is to prove an equivalence, so the assumptions are inherent. But according to the example, the user extracted specific conditions. Given that, perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For any line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nBut wait, that's only one direction. Alternatively, since the problem is an equivalence, maybe the assumptions are separated into two parts for each direction. But the example didn't do that; it listed the assumptions as given. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set in a real vector space.\n- L is any line in the vector space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex if and only if its intersection with any line L is convex.\n\nBut to match the example's structure, where assumptions are specific conditions applied to the problem. Since the problem is about any line L, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- L is any line.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex if and only if C ∩ L is convex for every line L.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were more specific to the problem's conditions. So, given that, I think the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For every line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex.\n\nBut that's only one direction. Wait, no. The problem is an equivalence. The user's original problem is to prove the equivalence. The example given by the user had a one-directional proof but structured the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the example has an error, but we need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to structure the problem as per the example. The example extracted assumptions from the problem, even if they were not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, the assumption that n is divisible by 7 might not have been in the original problem but was inferred. However, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed as separate conditions.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, even though the original problem is an equivalence, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For any line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex.\n\nBut that's only the converse direction. Alternatively, if the problem is to prove both directions, then the problem statement should remain as the equivalence. Given that, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- A line L is any one-dimensional affine subset.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex if and only if its intersection with every line L is convex.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are specific conditions on the objects involved. The user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- C is a set.\n- For every line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex.\n\nBut that's only the reverse direction. Alternatively, the problem might need to capture both directions. The user's example structured the problem with assumptions leading to the conclusion. Given the confusion, perhaps the best way is to follow the structure of the example, even if it seems flawed. In the example, the problem was originally about proving for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, with the problem to prove A(n) divisible by 91. However, that changes the original problem's meaning. The user might have intended to extract specific conditions from the problem, but perhaps the example is incorrect. Nonetheless, proceeding with the current problem.\n\nThe original problem is to prove C is convex ⇨ C ∩ L is convex for any L, and conversely. The formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem is an equivalence, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For every line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex.\n\nBut that only covers the converse direction. Alternatively, to capture both directions, the problem statement must remain as the equivalence. Therefore, the correct format is:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For any line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex if and only if C is convex.\n\nBut that seems redundant. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions are the conditions for each direction. However, since the example didn't handle equivalences, perhaps the user's intended format is to split into two separate problems. But the user's example didn't. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to structure the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For any line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex.\n\nBut this only covers the reverse direction (⇐). The forward direction (⇒) would have the assumption that C is convex and the problem to prove C ∩ L is convex for any L. However, since the original problem is an equivalence, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For any line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex if and only if the above assumption holds.\n\nBut the example's problem statement was a single direction. Given the confusion, I think the best approach is to follow the user's example as closely as possible, even if there are inconsistencies. In the example, the original problem was to prove for all integers n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, with the problem to prove A(n) divisible by 91. But that changes the original problem, which was for all integers, not just those divisible by 7. However, if we follow that pattern, for the current problem, even if it's an equivalence, we list the assumptions as the conditions for one direction.\n\nBut the original problem is to prove the equivalence. Therefore, perhaps the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For any line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex.\n\nBut that's only half. Alternatively, if we consider the problem as stated in the title: \"Proof that a set C is convex ⇨ its intersection with any line is convex\", which is only one direction, but the user's question includes the converse. The user's problem statement includes both directions. Therefore, to capture both, the formatted problem should state the equivalence.\n\nGiven that, the correct format is:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- For any line L, the intersection C ∩ L is convex.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex if and only if its intersection with every line L is convex.\n\nBut the problem statement is the same as the assumption. Wait, no. The problem is to prove the equivalence. The assumptions should be the conditions given. However, since it's an equivalence, both directions are part of the problem. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nFor the forward direction (⇒):\n- C is convex.\n- L is any line.\n\nFor the reverse direction (⇐):\n- For every line L, C ∩ L is convex.\n\nBut since the format requires listing all assumptions and the problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- L is any line.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex if and only if C ∩ L is convex for every line L.\n\nThis seems to align with the example where the problem's assumptions are listed, and the problem is the statement to prove. The example's problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n, so perhaps the example is flawed. Nevertheless, following the user's structure, the current problem's assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- C is a set.\n- L is any line.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is convex if and only if its intersection with any line L is convex.\n\nThis captures the equivalence. Each assumption is a single condition: C is a set, and L is any line. The problem is to prove the equivalence. Therefore, this should be the formatted answer.",
