    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that there are infinitely many integers n such that 4n² + 1 is divisible by both 13 and 5. So, essentially, they need to show that 4n² + 1 ≡ 0 mod 13 and 4n² + 1 ≡ 0 mod 5 for infinitely many integers n. Then, since 13 and 5 are coprime, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this would imply that 4n² + 1 ≡ 0 mod 65, which is 13*5.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem into two separate congruences.\n\nStarting with modulus 5. We need 4n² + 1 ≡ 0 mod 5. Let's simplify this:\n\n4n² ≡ -1 mod 5. Since -1 mod 5 is 4, this becomes 4n² ≡ 4 mod 5. Dividing both sides by 4 (which is invertible modulo 5 since gcd(4,5)=1), we get n² ≡ 1 mod 5. So n must satisfy n ≡ ±1 mod 5. Therefore, possible residues for n modulo 5 are 1 and 4.\n\nNext, modulus 13. Similarly, 4n² + 1 ≡ 0 mod 13 → 4n² ≡ -1 mod 13. Let's find solutions to this. Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod 13. The inverse of 4 mod 13 is 10 because 4*10=40≡1 mod13. Therefore, n² ≡ -1*10 ≡ -10 ≡ 3 mod13. So we need n² ≡3 mod13. Let's check which numbers squared mod13 give 3. Testing residues from 0 to 12:\n\n0²=0, 1=1, 2=4, 3=9, 4=16≡3. Ah, so n ≡4 mod13 or n≡-4≡9 mod13. Also checking 5²=25≡12, 6²=36≡10, 7²=49≡10, 8²=64≡12, 9²=81≡3, 10²=100≡9, 11²=121≡4, 12²=144≡1. Wait, so n²≡3 mod13 occurs when n≡4 or 9 mod13.\n\nSo, for the modulus 13 part, n must ≡4 or 9 mod13.\n\nNow, to find n that satisfies both congruences: n ≡1 or 4 mod5 and n≡4 or9 mod13. We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here. Since 5 and13 are coprime, there are solutions modulo 65 (since 5*13=65). Each combination of residues mod5 and mod13 will give a unique solution mod65. There are 2 possibilities for mod5 and 2 for mod13, so total 4 solutions mod65. Once we find these solutions, since they are distinct mod65, adding any multiple of 65 will give another solution, hence infinitely many.\n\nSo let's compute the four combinations:\n\nCase 1: n ≡1 mod5 and n≡4 mod13\nCase 2: n ≡1 mod5 and n≡9 mod13\nCase 3: n ≡4 mod5 and n≡4 mod13\nCase 4: n ≡4 mod5 and n≡9 mod13\n\nLet's solve each case.\n\nCase1: n ≡1 mod5 and n≡4 mod13\nLet n=5k+1. Then 5k+1 ≡4 mod13 →5k≡3 mod13. Multiply both sides by inverse of5 mod13. The inverse of5 mod13 is 8 since 5*8=40≡1 mod13. So k≡3*8=24≡11 mod13. Thus k=13m+11, so n=5*(13m+11)+1=65m+56. So solutions here are n≡56 mod65.\n\nCase2: n ≡1 mod5 and n≡9 mod13\nSimilarly, n=5k+1. Then 5k+1≡9 mod13 →5k≡8 mod13. Multiply by inverse 8: k≡8*8=64≡12 mod13. So k=13m+12, n=5*(13m+12)+1=65m+61. So n≡61 mod65.\n\nCase3: n≡4 mod5 and n≡4 mod13\nn=5k+4. Then 5k+4≡4 mod13 →5k≡0 mod13. Thus k≡0 mod13. So k=13m, so n=5*13m+4=65m+4. So n≡4 mod65.\n\nCase4: n≡4 mod5 and n≡9 mod13\nn=5k+4. 5k+4≡9 mod13 →5k≡5 mod13. Divide both sides by5 (multiply by inverse 8): k≡5*8=40≡1 mod13. So k=13m+1, n=5*(13m+1)+4=65m+9. Thus n≡9 mod65.\n\nSo the four solutions mod65 are n≡4,9,56,61 mod65. Each of these congruence classes will have infinitely many integers n, hence the original statement is proven. Moreover, the user found n=4 and n=9 in their examples, which are the first terms in two of these sequences. The other solutions (56 and61) would come later, like n=56,61, 56+65=121, etc.\n\nTherefore, by showing there are four distinct solutions modulo65, and since 65 is the product of 5 and13, each solution can generate infinitely many n by adding multiples of65. Hence, there are infinitely many such integers n.",
