    "Content": "Take a two digit number $10x+y$ of which both digits are different. now add $y-x$ to this number. By repeating this process you will get a chain of numbers $45,46,48,52,49,54,53,51,47,50.$ after $50, 45$ will come and chain will repeat. from any number we will enter in this chain. Can anyone help me to prove this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First of all, you must check that this process stays inside $\\{1...99\\}$. At each stage the iterated function $f$ adds a number between $0$ and $9$, so in order to have $f(x)>99$, we would need $x>90$. But for $x>90$, the units digit is always smaller, so you're always adding a negative value. Similarly, to have $f(x)<1$, we would need $x<10$, but then the units digit is always bigger, so you always add a positive value. So, since we always stay within that finite set, we must get a repetition eventually. As soon as that happens, we'll enter a cycle. We have only to verify that the one you describe in your question is the only one. This can be checked explicitly by getting a computer to calculate $f(x)$ for $1\\leq x\\leq 100$: Bigger image . Sorry about the messy graph, couldn't find good plotting software. I somewhat doubt there's any more profound proof than that. It's a fairly arbitrary mapping as far as I can see. The fact that it will eventually repeat is something common to all mappings of a finite set to itself. Some of those mappings have $3$ cycles. Some have $18$. This one happened to have $1$. Sure, why not. Or, to put it another way, the non-trivial feature of your function is that it maps $\\{1, ... 99\\}$ into itself, and the cycle is just a corollary of that. What I do find interesting is the symmetry of the above graph. It could be explained if we could prove that: $$f(99 - x) = 99 - f(x)$$ That is, the involution $x\\to99-x$ is an automorphism for this system (not sure if the word \"automorphism\" is actually used in this context, but if nothing else it's certainly an automorphism of the above directed graph). This is because this involution has the effect of replacing each digit in a two-digit number with $9$ minus itself, so $10x+y$ gets mapped to $10(9 - x) + (9 - y)$. So the difference between the two digits changes from $y-x$ to $(9-y)-(9-x)=x-y$, that is, it gets multiplied by $-1$. So if $x$ is a two digit number and $f(x)=x+d$, we have: $$99-f(x)=99-(x+d)=(99-x)-d=f(99-x)$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem according to the given example. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a two-digit number where both digits are different. The process is adding (y - x) to the number, where x is the tens digit and y is the ones digit. Repeating this process creates a chain that eventually enters a loop: 45,46,48,52,49,54,53,51,47,50, and then back to 45. The task is to prove that starting from any such two-digit number, you end up in this chain.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single condition on one object. The original number is two-digit, so 10x + y. Both digits are different, so x ≠ y. The process involves adding (y - x) each time. The chain mentioned is specific, so maybe there's an assumption about the chain's existence? But probably the main assumptions are about the initial number and the process.\n\nWait, the problem says \"from any number we will enter in this chain.\" So the assumptions should include that the starting number is a two-digit number with distinct digits. Then the process is defined as adding (y - x) each time.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, the assumption included \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The number is a two-digit number, i.e., of the form 10x + y where x and y are digits (x from 1 to 9, y from 0 to 9).\n- The digits x and y are different (x ≠ y).\n- The process involves iteratively adding (y - x) to the current number.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"from any number we will enter in this chain.\" So the problem is to prove that starting from any two-digit number with distinct digits, repeated application of adding (y - x) leads into the given chain.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have assumptions:\n\nAssumption: \nThe number is a two-digit integer of the form 10x + y,\nx and y are distinct digits (x ≠ y),\nThe process involves adding (y - x) to the current number,\nThe chain is defined as 45,46,48,52,49,54,53,51,47,50 repeating.\n\nProblem: Prove that starting from any two-digit number with distinct digits, the process enters the given chain.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is to show that regardless of the starting number (meeting the two-digit and distinct digits), the chain is entered. So the assumptions would be the initial conditions on the number, and the process definition.\n\nLet me check the example again. The original problem had A(n) defined, and the assumption was n is an integer and n divisible by 7. But in the given problem here, the user's example had the assumptions split into each being a single property on one object. So here, the initial number must be two-digit (10x + y), digits distinct, and the process is adding y - x each time.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the question is: \"from any number we will enter in this chain. Can anyone help me to prove this?\"\n\nSo the formatted problem would list the assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nLet me structure it step by step:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The number is a two-digit integer, represented as 10x + y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit.\n2. The digits x and y are distinct (x ≠ y).\n3. The process involves adding (y - x) to the current number in each step.\n\nProblem: Prove that starting from any such two-digit number, repeatedly applying the process leads to entering the chain 45, 46, 48, 52, 49, 54, 53, 51, 47, 50, after which the chain repeats starting from 45.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 under the assumptions. Here, the problem is to prove that the process leads into the chain. So the assumptions are the initial conditions (two-digit, distinct digits, process defined as adding y - x), and the problem is to show that the chain is entered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the chain's existence is part of the problem, but the user's question states that after 50, 45 comes again, so the chain is given. The task is to prove that any starting number enters this chain.\n\nSo the assumptions are the initial number's properties and the process, and the problem is to prove that the chain is eventually entered.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a two-digit integer of the form 10x + y,\nx and y are distinct digits (x ≠ y),\nEach step adds (y - x) to the current number,\nThe chain 45,46,48,52,49,54,53,51,47,50 repeats after 50.\n\nProblem: Prove that starting from any two-digit number with distinct digits, the process enters the given chain.\n\nWait, but the chain's repetition is part of the problem's observation. The user is asking to prove that from any starting number, you enter this chain. So maybe the assumptions don't include the chain's existence. The chain is part of the problem statement. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a two-digit integer of the form 10x + y,\nx and y are distinct digits (x ≠ y),\nEach step adds (y - x) to the current number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the process eventually enters the repeating chain 45,46,48,52,49,54,53,51,47,50.\n\nBut the original problem says \"from any number we will enter in this chain.\" So the problem is to prove that regardless of the starting two-digit number with distinct digits, you end up in that chain. So the assumptions are the initial conditions (two-digit, distinct digits, process defined as adding y - x), and the problem is to show that the chain is entered.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a two-digit integer of the form 10x + y,\nx and y are distinct digits (x ≠ y),\nEach step adds (y - x) to the current number.\n\nProblem: Prove that starting from any such number, the process enters the repeating chain 45,46,48,52,49,54,53,51,47,50.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the assumption included both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). Here, the problem is general for any two-digit number with distinct digits, so the assumptions are all the starting conditions. The process is part of the problem's procedure, so that's an assumption as well.\n\nTherefore, each bullet in the assumption is a single condition. Let me check:\n\n- The number is a two-digit integer of the form 10x + y. (This combines two things: two-digit and its form. Maybe split into \"The number is a two-digit integer\" and \"The number can be expressed as 10x + y where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit.\" But perhaps in the example, they combined similar. The example had \"A(n) = ...\", but the assumption was about n being integer and divisible by 7. So maybe here, \"The number is a two-digit integer\" as one assumption, and \"The digits x and y satisfy x ≠ y\" as another.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a two-digit integer,\nThe digits x (tens place) and y (units place) are distinct,\nEach step in the process adds (y - x) to the current number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the process eventually enters the repeating chain 45,46,48,52,49,54,53,51,47,50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the process is defined as adding (y - x) to the current number, where x and y are the digits of the current number.\" Because in each step, x and y refer to the current number's digits. So that's part of the process definition.\n\nYes, so the process is that given a number 10a + b, the next number is (10a + b) + (b - a). Wait, but in the problem statement, they mention \"add y - x to this number. By repeating this process...\"\n\nSo each time, take the current number, which is 10x + y (with x and y its current digits), then add (y - x) to it. So the next number is 10x + y + (y - x) = 9x + 2y.\n\nBut this transformation depends on the digits of the current number. So the process is to take the current number, split into digits x and y, then compute next number as 10x + y + (y - x) = 9x + 2y.\n\nSo the process is deterministic, but dependent on the digits of the current number. Therefore, each step's operation is part of the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The initial number is a two-digit integer.\n- The digits of the initial number are distinct.\n- Each subsequent number is generated by adding the difference between the units digit and the tens digit (y - x) to the current number.\n\nThus, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe initial number is a two-digit integer,\nThe digits of the initial number are distinct,\nEach step computes the next number as current number plus (units digit - tens digit).\n\nProblem: Prove that starting from any such initial number, the process eventually enters the repeating chain 45, 46, 48, 52, 49, 54, 53, 51, 47, 50.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a single condition. The problem is to prove entry into the chain.",
