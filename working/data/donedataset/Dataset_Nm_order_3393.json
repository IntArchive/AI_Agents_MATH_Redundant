    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The task is to show that the expected value E(X) of a non-negative integer-valued random variable X with finite mean can be expressed as the sum from n=0 to infinity of P(X > n). The hint suggests starting with the definition E(X) = sum from x=1 to infinity of x * P(X = x) and rewriting it as a double sum. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of expected value for such a random variable. Since X is non-negative and integer-valued, the standard definition is indeed the sum over all possible integer values x starting from 1 (since x=0 would contribute 0) multiplied by their probabilities. But the problem wants me to express this as a sum of probabilities that X is greater than n, starting from n=0.\n\nThe hint mentions a double sum. Let me think about how to turn the original sum into a double sum. If I have sum_{x=1}^∞ x * P(X = x), perhaps I can express x as a sum of 1's. For example, x = sum_{n=0}^{x-1} 1. That way, each x is represented as a sum of 1 from n=0 to n=x-1. Then substituting this into the original expectation formula would give me a double sum where the inner sum is over n=0 to x-1, and the outer sum is over x=1 to infinity. \n\nSo, replacing x with sum_{n=0}^{x-1} 1, the expectation becomes sum_{x=1}^∞ [sum_{n=0}^{x-1} 1] * P(X = x). If I switch the order of summation, maybe I can get sum_{n=0}^∞ sum_{x=n+1}^∞ P(X = x). That inner sum from x=n+1 to infinity of P(X = x) is exactly P(X > n), because it's the probability that X is greater than n. Therefore, the double sum becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ P(X > n), which is the desired result. \n\nWait, let me verify that switching the order of summation is valid here. Since all terms are non-negative (probabilities are non-negative), by Tonelli's theorem, we can interchange the order of summation without changing the result. That makes sense because the problem states that X has a finite mean, which ensures convergence. \n\nLet me structure this more formally. Starting with E(X) = sum_{x=1}^∞ x P(X = x). Write x as sum_{n=1}^x 1, but actually, if x is an integer, then x = sum_{n=0}^{x-1} 1. So substituting that in, we get sum_{x=1}^∞ [sum_{n=0}^{x-1} 1] P(X = x). Then swapping the sums: sum_{n=0}^∞ sum_{x=n+1}^∞ P(X = x). Because for each n, x starts from n+1 to infinity, since n goes up to x-1. The inner sum is P(X > n), so the whole expression is sum_{n=0}^∞ P(X > n). \n\nTherefore, the key steps are expressing x as a sum of indicators, switching the order of summation, and recognizing the inner sum as the probability that X exceeds n. This transformation hinges on the non-negativity and the integer-valued nature of X, ensuring that the double sum manipulation is valid. The finite mean condition likely ensures that the series converges, so we don't have to worry about divergence issues when swapping the sums.",
