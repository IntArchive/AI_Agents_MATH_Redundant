    "Content": "Show that $$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{k-1}k \\sin(ax)}{a^{2}+k^{2}}=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\sinh(ax)}{\\sinh(\\pi a)}, \\;\\ x\\in (-\\pi,\\pi)$$ It appears to me this series is crying out for the use of Fourier series.  It seems to me I get close, but am failing to put the pieces all together. Thus, I tried using the Fourier series for $f(x)=e^{ax}$.  $\\qquad \\cosh(ax)$ gives the same thing. $$a_{k}=\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}e^{ax} \\cos(kx)dx=\\frac{e^{a\\pi}(a \\cos(k\\pi)+k \\sin(k\\pi))}{\\pi (a^{2}+k^{2})}-\\frac{e^{-a\\pi}(a \\cos(k\\pi)-k \\sin(k \\pi))}{\\pi (a^{2}+k^{2})}$$ $b_{k}=0$ The given series is evident amongst $a_{n}$, but I kind of get hung up. $\\displaystyle a_{0}=\\frac{2 \\sinh(\\pi a)}{\\pi a}$ Now, using $\\displaystyle e^{ax}=\\frac{a_{0}}{2}+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}a_{k} \\cos(kx)\\Rightarrow e^{ax}=\\frac{\\sinh(\\pi a)}{\\pi a}+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}a_{k} \\cos(kx)$ I even tried equating real and imaginary parts. Where the definite integral becomes $$\\left(\\frac{(a \\cos(k\\pi)+k \\sin(k\\pi))e^{a \\pi}}{a^{2}+k^{2}}+\\frac{(a \\sin(k\\pi)-k  \\cos(k\\pi))e^{a\\pi}}{a^{2}+k^{2}}i\\right)$$ $$-\\left(\\frac{(a \\cos(k\\pi)-k \\sin(k\\pi))e^{-\\pi a}}{a^{2}+k^{2}}-\\frac{(a \\sin(k\\pi)+k \\cos(k\\pi))e^{-a\\pi}}{a^{2}+k^{2}}i\\right)$$ I think I can equate the imaginary and real parts: $$e^{ax}=\\frac{e^{\\pi a}-e^{-\\pi a}}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}..............$$ I get mixed up here.  The identity in the previous line is $ \\sinh(\\pi a)$, so it looks like I am onto something.  If that $e^{ax}$ on the left of the equals sign were $ \\sinh(ax)$, then a little algebra and I would practically be done. I tried to get to the known sum, but can't quite get there. There is something I  am overlooking. Can anyone point me in the right direction, please?.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider $\\sinh(ax)$. Note that it is an odd function and hence if we expand it in sine's and cosine's the coefficient of cosines will be zero. Hence, we can write $\\displaystyle \\sinh(ax) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_k \\sin(kx)$ $$a_k = \\frac1{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sinh(ax) \\sin(kx) dx$$ $$I = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sinh(ax) \\sin(kx) dx = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{e^{ax} - e^{-ax}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{e^{ikx} - e^{-ikx}}{2i} \\right) dx $$\n$$I = \\frac1{4i} \\left( \\frac{e^{(a+ik)x}}{a+ik} - \\frac{e^{(a-ik)x}}{a-ik} - \\frac{e^{(-a+ik)x}}{-a+ik} - \\frac{e^{-(a+ik)x}}{a+ik} \\right)_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}$$\n$$I = \\frac{2}{4i} \\left( \\frac{(-1)^k e^{a \\pi}}{a+ik} - \\frac{(-1)^k e^{a \\pi}}{a-ik} - \\frac{(-1)^k e^{-a \\pi}}{-a+ik} - \\frac{(-1)^k e^{-a \\pi}}{a+ik} \\right)$$\n$$I = \\frac{(-1)^k}{2i} \\left( \\frac{-2 i k e^{a \\pi}}{a^2+k^2} + \\frac{2 i k e^{-a \\pi}}{a^2+k^2} \\right) = (-1)^{k-1} \\frac{2 k }{a^2 + k^2} \\sinh(a \\pi)$$\nHence, we have\n$$\\sinh(ax) = \\frac{ 2 \\sinh(a \\pi) }{\\pi} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{k-1} \\frac{k}{a^2 + k^2} \\sin(kx)$$\nRewriting, we get the desired result, namely\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{ (-1)^{k-1} k \\sin(kx)}{a^2 + k^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\sinh(ax)}{\\sinh(a \\pi)}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user wants to show that the infinite sum Σ [(-1)^(k-1) * k * sin(ax)] / (a² + k²) from k=1 to infinity equals (π/2) * sinh(ax)/sinh(π a) for x in (-π, π). They mentioned using Fourier series for e^(ax) or cosh(ax), and they provided some integrals for the Fourier coefficients a_k and a_0. Their confusion seems to be about connecting the Fourier series they derived to the given sum.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states x is in (-π, π), so that's one assumption. The function they're using is e^(ax), which has a Fourier series with coefficients calculated. The user also mentions that the series in question is part of the a_n coefficients, but they're stuck. So another assumption might be about using the Fourier series of e^(ax) or perhaps a related function. The problem involves Fourier series, so that's an assumption about the method.\n\nWait, but according to the example, assumptions should list conditions or properties applied to the objects. Let's break it down.\n\nAssumptions from the problem:\n\n1. x is in the interval (-π, π). This is a domain condition on x.\n2. The function considered is e^(ax) (or possibly cosh(ax), but the user tried e^(ax)). So maybe \"the Fourier series of e^(ax) is used\".\n3. The Fourier coefficients a_k and a_0 are computed as given. So specific integral expressions for a_k and a_0.\n4. The series in question involves (-1)^(k-1) * k * sin(ax)/(a² +k²), which relates to the imaginary parts or the sine terms in the Fourier series. Wait, but the user mentions that b_k=0 for the Fourier series of e^(ax). Wait, e^(ax) is not an even function, so why is b_k zero? Wait, no. Wait, the Fourier series of e^(ax) over (-π, π) would have both sine and cosine terms. Wait, in their calculation, they got a_k as the cosine coefficients and b_k as zero? That seems odd unless they're expanding an even function. Wait, maybe they considered the even extension? The user mentioned that cosh(ax) gives the same thing. Hmm. Maybe they are expanding f(x) = e^{ax} as a Fourier series, but if they considered the even part, that would be cosh(ax). But the user says that using cosh(ax) gives the same thing. So maybe the function is actually even, so they use cosh(ax) which is even, hence b_k=0. But the original problem has a sine term, so maybe there's a connection to the odd extension?\n\nWait, the original sum has sin(ax), which is an odd function. But the user tried using the Fourier series of e^{ax} which isn't odd or even. The user's a_k (Fourier cosine coefficients) involve integrals of e^{ax} * cos(kx) dx over [-π, π], and b_k would be integrals of e^{ax} * sin(kx) dx. But they mention that b_k=0. That can't be right unless they are expanding an even function. So maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the user is confused here, which is part of the problem. But as the person structuring the problem, I need to note the assumptions as per their approach.\n\nLooking at their steps:\n\n- They used f(x) = e^{ax} and computed the Fourier coefficients.\n- They found that a_k is given by the integral expression they provided, and b_k=0. But in reality, if f(x) is e^{ax}, then both a_k and b_k would be non-zero. However, if they considered the even extension of e^{ax}, which is cosh(ax), then yes, b_k would be zero. So maybe they mixed up e^{ax} and cosh(ax). The user mentions \"cosh(ax) gives the same thing\", which might mean that when they tried using cosh(ax), they got similar expressions. But since they're trying to connect to a series involving sin(ax), which is odd, perhaps they should be using the Fourier sine series?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an assumption that the function is expanded in a certain way. The problem statement is a bit unclear here, but the key assumptions are:\n\n- x ∈ (-π, π)\n- The function f(x) is e^{ax} or cosh(ax)\n- The Fourier series coefficients are computed as given (a_k and a_0)\n- The series to evaluate involves alternating signs and sine terms, which is part of the Fourier series components.\n\nBut to structure the problem as per the example, the assumptions should list conditions on the objects involved. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. x is an element of the interval (-π, π).\n2. The Fourier series of the function f(x) = e^{ax} is considered.\n3. The Fourier coefficients a_k are computed as (1/π) ∫_{-π}^{π} e^{ax} cos(kx) dx.\n4. The coefficient b_k (Fourier sine coefficients) is zero.\n5. The series to evaluate is related to the imaginary parts of the Fourier coefficients.\n\nWait, but the user mentions that when they equate real and imaginary parts, they get stuck. Maybe another assumption is that the imaginary parts of some expression lead to the desired series. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming the use of complex Fourier series. The integral expressions given by the user involve complex terms, which suggests they might be considering complex exponentials, but then they separated real and imaginary parts. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n1. x ∈ (-π, π).\n2. The function f(x) = e^{ax} is expanded in Fourier series.\n3. The Fourier coefficients a_k are given by the provided integral expressions.\n4. The coefficient a_0 is 2 sinh(π a)/(π a).\n5. The series in question is derived from the imaginary parts of the Fourier coefficients.\n\nBut the problem is about evaluating the sum involving sin(ax), which is a sine term, but in the user's approach, they're using the Fourier cosine series (since b_k=0). That might be the confusion. So perhaps the correct assumption is that the function being expanded is even, hence b_k=0, but the sum to evaluate involves sine terms, which suggests a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in assuming b_k=0, but the actual problem requires considering the Fourier sine series. But according to the user's description, they computed a_k for the Fourier series of e^{ax} and found b_k=0, which is incorrect unless the function is even. So perhaps the user is actually expanding the even extension of e^{ax}, which is cosh(ax), leading to b_k=0. But then, to get a sine series, they would need the odd extension. So maybe the problem requires using the Fourier sine series for sinh(ax), but the user is trying to use the Fourier cosine series for cosh(ax).\n\nGiven all that, I need to list the assumptions based on the problem's given information and the user's approach. The user tried using the Fourier series of e^{ax} and cosh(ax), computed a_k and a_0, and the series in question is part of their calculations. But they get mixed up when trying to equate real and imaginary parts.\n\nTo structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should include:\n\n- x is in (-π, π)\n- The Fourier series of f(x) = e^{ax} is used\n- The Fourier coefficients a_k are computed as given (the integral expression)\n- a_0 is computed as 2 sinh(π a)/(π a)\n- The series involves terms from the Fourier coefficients\n\nBut since the user's problem is to connect their Fourier series to the given sum, perhaps the key assumptions are about the function and the interval. The problem statement itself is to evaluate the sum using Fourier series, so the main assumption is the method (using Fourier series). However, according to the example, assumptions are about conditions applied to objects in the problem.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So here, for the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. x is in the interval (-π, π).\n2. The function f(x) = e^{ax} has a Fourier series representation.\n3. The Fourier coefficients a_k and a_0 are computed as given.\n4. The series in question is derived from the Fourier series coefficients.\n\nBut maybe it's better to be concise. The problem requires evaluating the sum using Fourier series, so the main assumption is the use of Fourier series for a specific function. The user tried using e^{ax} and cosh(ax), but the correct function might be related to sinh(ax). However, since the user mentioned e^{ax}, perhaps we should include that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. x ∈ (-π, π).\n2. The function f(x) = e^{ax} is expressed as a Fourier series.\n3. The Fourier coefficients a_k and a_0 are calculated as provided.\n4. The imaginary parts of the Fourier series are considered.\n\nBut since the sum involves sine terms, maybe the assumption is that the imaginary part of the Fourier series corresponds to the given sum. However, the user tried equating real and imaginary parts but got stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that the sum can be evaluated by considering the Fourier series of a specific function, and the user is using the Fourier series of e^{ax}.\n\nPutting this together, the formatted problem should have assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nx is an element of the interval (-π, π),\nthe Fourier series of the function f(x) = e^{ax} is considered,\nthe Fourier coefficients aₖ are computed as (1/π) ∫_{-π}^{π} e^{ax} cos(kx) dx,\nthe Fourier sine coefficients bₖ are zero,\nthe given series is derived from the Fourier series coefficients.\n\nBut wait, the user says \"bₖ=0\", which would be the case if the function is even. But e^{ax} is not even unless a=0. So maybe the actual assumption is that they are expanding an even function, like cosh(ax), which would make bₖ=0. The user mentioned that cosh(ax) gives the same thing, so perhaps they tried both e^{ax} and cosh(ax). This is a bit confusing, but according to the problem statement, the user tried both.\n\nAlternatively, to stick strictly to what's in the question:\n\nThe user's assumptions as per their approach:\n\n- f(x) = e^{ax} is expanded in Fourier series.\n- Calculated aₖ as given.\n- bₖ=0 (which might be incorrect, but that's what they state).\n- a₀ is 2 sinh(π a)/(π a).\n- They are trying to equate real/imaginary parts to derive the sum.\n\nBut the problem is to show that the sum equals the given expression. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. x ∈ (-π, π).\n2. The function f(x) = e^{ax} is represented by its Fourier series.\n3. The Fourier coefficients aₖ and a₀ are as computed.\n4. The imaginary parts of the Fourier series are related to the given sum.\n\nBut the user's confusion is that they can't connect the Fourier series to the sum. The given sum has (-1)^{k-1} k sin(ax)/(a² +k²), and the user's aₖ has terms with (-1)^k (from cos(kπ) = (-1)^k) and e^{aπ} and e^{-aπ}.\n\nPutting this all together, the formatted problem's assumptions should capture the key conditions mentioned in the problem statement and the user's approach. The main assumptions are the interval for x, the function being expanded, the form of the Fourier coefficients, and possibly the relation to the series in question.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, here's how I would structure it:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval (-π, π),\nthe function f(x) = e^{ax} is expanded in a Fourier series,\nthe Fourier cosine coefficients aₖ are given by the integral (1/π) ∫_{-π}^{π} e^{ax} cos(kx) dx,\nthe Fourier sine coefficients bₖ are zero,\nthe series to evaluate involves terms from the Fourier coefficients.\n\nBut the user mentioned that bₖ=0, which is only true for even functions. Since e^{ax} isn't even, this might be an error. However, the user's approach states bₖ=0, so we include that as their assumption, even if it's incorrect. The problem is structuring their question, not correcting it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user considered the even extension, leading to cosh(ax), hence bₖ=0. But the user explicitly mentions using e^{ax} and cosh(ax) gives the same thing. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval (-π, π),\nthe Fourier series of f(x) = e^{ax} is used,\nthe Fourier cosine coefficients aₖ are computed as provided,\nthe Fourier sine coefficients bₖ are zero,\nthe coefficient a₀ is 2 sinh(π a)/(π a).\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{k-1}k \\sin(ax)}{a^{2}+k^{2}}=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\sinh(ax)}{\\sinh(\\pi a)}$$ for x ∈ (-π, π) using Fourier series.\n\nThis seems to capture the user's approach and the problem's requirements.",
