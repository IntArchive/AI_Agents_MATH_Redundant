    "Content": "We have a $100\\times100$ board divided into $10^4$ unit squares. These squares are coloured with four colours so that every row and every column has $25$ squares\n  of each colour. Prove that there are $2$ rows and $2$ columns such that their $4$ intersections are painted with different colors. My attempt: I first counted number of pairs $\\mathcal P$ $(r_1,r_2)$ such that $r_1,r_2$ belongs to same row, but different in colour. This can be done in $$\\binom 42\\times25\\times 25$$ ways. So, in $100$ rows, this number is $$100\\times\\binom 42\\times25\\times 25$$ Now, we can find a pair of columns in $$\\binom{100}2$$ ways. So, by Pigeonhole Principle, we can find at least a pair of columns containing $$\\left\\lceil\\frac{100\\times\\binom 42\\times25\\times 25}{\\binom{100}2}\\right\\rceil\\\\=\\left\\lceil\\frac{100\\times75\\times 50}{50\\times99}\\right\\rceil\\\\=76$$ of those pairs $\\mathcal P$. But unable to proceed anymore. And this approach too seems misleading, because in every pair of columns, we can always find $\\binom42\\times25\\times25$ pairs from $\\mathcal P$. So, this approach makes no sense, I think. What should be correct approach? And also, \"if we pour $nk+1$ objects into $n$ urns, then there is an urn with $k+1$ objects\", can this concept be plugged in this question?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let the colors used be $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$. We call an unordered pair of squares neoliberal if the two squares lie in the same row and are of different colors. Every row gives rise to $6 \\cdot 25^2$ neoliberal pairs (given by $\\binom{4}{2}$ possible pairs of colors and $25$ squares of each color). Thus, summing over all the rows, there is a total of $100 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 25^2$ neoliberal pairs. On the other hand, each such pair is simply the intersection of one row with a pair of distinct columns. Because there are$$\\binom{100}{2} = 100 \\cdot 99/2$$pairs of columns, some pair of columns contains at least$${{100 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 25^2}\\over{100 \\cdot 99/2}} = {{2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 25^2}\\over{99}} > {{12 \\cdot 25^2}\\over{4 \\cdot 25}} = 75$$neoliberal pairs. Thus, some two fixed columns form neoliberal pairs in at least $76$ rows. We henceforth ignore all other rows and columns; we may as well assume that we have only a $76 \\times 2$ board colored in four colors, in which each row contains two different colors and no color occurs more than $25$ times in each column. For each row, consider the pair of colors it contains. If the pairs $\\{A, B\\}$ and $\\{C, D\\}$ each occur in some row, we are done; likewise for $\\{A, C\\}$, $\\{B, D\\}$ and $\\{A, D\\}$, $\\{B, C\\}$. Thus, suppose that at most one pair of colors from each of these three sets occurs; we now seek a possible relabelling of colors: either $\\{A, B\\}$, $\\{A, C\\}$, $\\{A, D\\}$ are the only pairs that can occur, or $\\{A, B\\}$, $\\{A, C\\}$, $\\{B, C\\}$ are. In the first case, each of the $76$ rows contains a square of color $A$, implying that one column has more than $25$ squares of color $A$, a contradiction. In the second case, each column can contain only the letters $A$, $B$, $C$. There can only be $25$ squares of each color $A$, $B$, $C$ in each column, for a total of at most $150$ squares, but there are $152$ squares in total, a contradiction. This completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a 100x100 board where each unit square is colored with one of four colors. The conditions are that each row and each column has exactly 25 squares of each color. The goal is to prove that there exist two rows and two columns such that the four intersections (the squares where these rows and columns meet) are all different colors.\n\nFirst, let's list out the assumptions. The user mentions a 100x100 board, divided into unit squares. The coloring uses four colors. Each row has 25 squares of each color, and each column also has 25 squares of each color. These are the key conditions provided. \n\nThe original problem statement doesn't mention any additional constraints beyond the coloring distribution in rows and columns. The user's attempt involved counting pairs of rows with certain color properties and applying the pigeonhole principle, but they got stuck. However, the problem itself doesn't add any extra conditions beyond the initial setup. So, the assumptions should capture the structure of the board, the number of colors, and the distribution per row and column.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions line by line:\n\n1. The board has 100 rows and 100 columns. (It's a 100x100 board.)\n2. Each unit square is colored with one of four colors. (Four colors are used.)\n3. In every row, there are exactly 25 squares of each color. (Each row has 25 of each color.)\n4. In every column, there are exactly 25 squares of each color. (Each column has 25 of each color.)\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applying to different aspects: the board size, the number of colors, and the distribution in rows and columns. The problem then is to prove the existence of two rows and two columns with the intersections all differently colored.\n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions only include what's given in the problem, not the user's attempt. The user's attempt is part of their question but not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem itself doesn't mention any divisibility or additional constraints beyond the coloring. So the assumptions are straightforward as above.\n\nNow, structuring the problem part: The problem is to prove that there exist two rows and two columns such that their four intersecting squares are all different colors. That's the main statement to prove.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The board is a 100×100 grid of unit squares,\n- Each unit square is colored with one of four colors,\n- Each row contains exactly 25 squares of each color,\n- Each column contains exactly 25 squares of each color.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist 2 rows and 2 columns such that their 4 intersections are painted with different colors.\n\nI should check if each assumption is one property per line. The first line is the board size, second the coloring, third the row distribution, fourth the column distribution. That seems to fit the format. The problem statement is as given. The original title mentioned \"Russia (2000) contest\" but that's not part of the problem statement, so it's omitted. The user's attempt and their specific questions about the pigeonhole principle aren't part of the problem structure, so they are excluded from the formatted problem.",
