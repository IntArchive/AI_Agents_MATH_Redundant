    "Content": "Context: I'm studying for my discrete mathematics exam and I keep running into this question that I've failed to solve. The question is as follows. Problem: The main form for normal induction over natural numbers $n$ takes the following form: $P(1)$ is true, and for every $n, P(n-1)\\to P(n).\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\text{[Sometimes written as $P(n)\\to P(n+1)$]}$ If both 1 and 2 are true, then $P(n)$ is true for every $n$. The question is to prove the correctness of the form above. My work: My idea was to make a boolean statement and if it's a tautology in a true false table. That means the statement is always correct. I've tried many times but I've failed. Here is the original question in Hebrew: n טענה כלשהי לגבי מםפר טבעי  $P(n)$ תהי אם מתקימיים שני התנאים הבאים: 1- הטענה $P(0)$ נכונה 2- לכל n>0, $P(n)$ נכונות הטענה $P(n-1)$ גוררת את נכונות הטענה אז $P(n)$ נכונה לכל מספר טבעי n הוכיחו את נכונות משפט זה",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your question seems somewhat unclear to me, as it stands, but I'll answer the one in the title, and if the question is updated, I'll address that too. Mathematical induction can be taken as its own axiom, independent from the other (though, as comments point out, it can be proven as a theorem in common systems like ZF ). That is to say, it is more akin to statements like:\n$$x\\cdot (y+1)=x\\cdot y + x$$\nwhich are often taken to be part of the definition of multiplication and may not be derivable from more basic statements. The point behind such definitions is to capture some intuitive idea - the above starts to capture the distributive property of multiplication, which we know from intuition to be a reasonable idea. Yet, it is possible that we could not prove the above statement without taking it as an axiom. Induction basically says every natural number can be \"reached\" from zero. That is, if we have proven the statements: $P(1)$ is true $P(n)\\rightarrow P(n+1).$ Then, we can build a proof for every natural number. For instance, if we wanted to know that $P(5)$ was true, we could infer that, since $P(1)$ is true and $P(1)\\rightarrow P(2)$, we have $P(2)$. But $P(2)\\rightarrow P(3)$ and $P(3)\\rightarrow P(4)$ and $P(4)\\rightarrow P(5)$, thus we can deduce $P(5)$ too. Induction merely says that $P(n)$ must be true for all natural numbers because we can create a proof like the one above for every natural. Without induction, we can, for any natural $n$, create a proof for $P(n)$ - induction just formalizes that and says we're allowed to jump from there to $\\forall n[ P(n)]$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the problem carefully.\n\nThe original question is about why mathematical induction is a valid proof technique. The user tried to approach it by creating a boolean statement and checking if it's a tautology but didn't succeed. The problem states that if P(1) is true and for every n, P(n-1) implies P(n), then P(n) is true for all n. They also mention the same thing with P(n) implying P(n+1). The task is to prove the correctness of this induction form.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the Assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one condition applied to one object. The problem is then restated concisely. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem states two conditions: \n1. P(1) is true. \n2. For every n, P(n-1) → P(n). \n\nBut wait, the original question in Hebrew mentions P(0) as the base case, which might correspond to starting at n=0. However, the user's translation mentions P(1) as the base case. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"Problem: The main form for normal induction over natural numbers n takes the following form: P(1) is true, and for every n, P(n-1)→P(n). [...] The question is to prove the correctness of the form above.\" The Hebrew part says P(0) is true. Hmm, maybe there's a mix between starting at 0 or 1. But in the problem statement provided by the user in English, it's P(1) as the base case and the implication is P(n-1)→P(n). So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. P(1) is true.\n2. For every natural number n ≥ 1, P(n-1) implies P(n).\n\nBut the problem is to prove that under these conditions, P(n) is true for all natural numbers n. However, in mathematical induction, the base case can be P(0) or P(1) depending on the context. The problem here uses P(1) as the base, so the natural numbers probably start at 1. But maybe the user is considering natural numbers starting at 0, hence the confusion with the Hebrew part. However, the problem as translated in English uses P(1) as the base. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- P(1) is true.\n- For every natural number n ≥ 1, if P(n-1) is true, then P(n) is true.\n\nTherefore, each assumption is a separate line. The problem is to prove that under these conditions, P(n) is true for all natural numbers n. \n\nI need to structure this into the required format. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nApplying that here, the Assumptions would be:\n- P(1) is true.\n- For every natural number n ≥ 1, P(n−1) implies P(n).\n\nProblem: Prove that P(n) is true for every natural number n.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, they mention \"for every n, P(n-1)→P(n)\" and \"P(1) is true\". So the two assumptions are those two points. Then the problem is to show P(n) holds for all n. \n\nYes, that's correct. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition. So the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and then state the problem as proving P(n) for all natural numbers n.",
