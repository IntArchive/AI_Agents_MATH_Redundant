    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a proof followed by conceptual elaboration, from my 2008/11/9 Ask an Algebraist post. Let R be an integral domain. Let every prime ideal in R be principal.\nProve that R is a principal ideal domain (PID) Below I present a simpler way to view the proof, and some references.\nFirst let's recall one well-known proof, as presented  by P.L. Clark (edited): Proof $_{\\:\\!1}$ $ $ Suppose not. Then the set of all nonprincipal ideals is nonempty.\nLet $\\{I_i\\}$ be a chain of nonprincipal ideals and put $\\,I = \\cup_i I_i.\\,$ If $I = (x)$ then $x \\in I_i$ for some $i,$ so $I = (x) \\subset I_i$ implies $I = I_i$ is principal, contradiction.\nThus by Zorn's Lemma there is an ideal $I$ which is maximal with respect to the\nproperty of not being principal. As is so often the case for ideals maximal\nwith respect to some property or other, we can show that I must be prime.\nIndeed, suppose that $ab \\in I$ but neither $a$ nor $b$ lies in I. Then the ideal $J = (I,a)$ is strictly larger than $I,$ so principal: say $J = (c).$ $I:a := \\{r \\in R\\ :\\ ra \\in I\\}$ is an ideal containing $I$ and $b,$ so strictly larger\nthan $I$ and thus principal: say $I:a = (d).$ Let $i \\in I,$ so $i = uc.$ Now $u(c) \\subset I$ so $ua \\in I$ so $u \\in I:a.$ Thus we may write $u = vd$ and $i = vcd.$ This shows $I \\subset (cd).\\ $ Conversely, $d \\in I:a$ implies $da \\in I$ so $d(I,a) = dJ \\subset I$ so $cd \\in I.$ Therefore $I = (cd)$ is principal, contradiction. $\\ \\ $ QED We show that the second part of the proof is just an ideal theoretic\nversion of a well-known fact about integers. Namely suppose that the\ninteger $i>1$ isn't prime. Then, by definition, there are integers $\\,a,b\\,$ such that $\\,i\\mid ab,\\ \\,i\\nmid a,b.\\,$ But this immediately yields a\nproper factorization of $\\,i,\\,$ namely $\\,i = c\\, (i\\!:\\!c),$ where $c = (i,a).\\,$ Hence: $ $ not prime $\\Rightarrow$ reducible (or: irreducible $\\Rightarrow$ prime). $ $ A similar constructive proof works much more generally, namely Lemma $ $ If ideal $I\\!\\ne\\! 1$ satisfies: ideal $\\,J \\supset I \\Rightarrow J\\,|\\,I\\,$ then $I$ not prime $\\Rightarrow I\\,$ reducible ( properly ). Proof $\\ $ $I$ not prime $\\Rightarrow$ exists $\\,a,b \\not\\in I\\,$ and $\\,ab \\in I.$ $\\ A := (I,a)\\supset I \\Rightarrow A\\mid I,\\,$ say $\\,I = AB;$ wlog we may assume $\\,b \\in B\\,$ since $A(B,b) = AB\\,$ via $Ab = (I,a)b \\subset I = AB.$ The factors $A,B$ are proper: $A = (I,a),\\, a \\not\\in I;\\,\\  B \\supset (I,b),\\, b \\not\\in I.\\quad$ QED Note that the contains $\\Rightarrow$ divides hypothesis: $J\\supset I \\Rightarrow J\\,|\\,I\\,$ is trivially true for principal ideals $J$ $($ hence proof $_{\\:\\!1}),\\,$ and also holds true for all ideals in a Dedekind domain.\nGenerally such ideals J are called multiplication ideals. Rings whose ideals satisfy this property are known as multiplication rings and their study goes back to Krull. The OP's problem is well-known: it is Exercise $1\\!-\\!1\\!-\\!10\\ p.8$ in Kaplansky: Commutative Rings, namely: (M. Isaacs) In a ring R let $I$ be maximal among non-principal\nideals. Prove that $I$ is prime. (Hint: adapt the proof of Theorem 7.\nWe have $(I,a) = (c).$ This time take $J =$ all $x$ with $xc \\in I.$ Since $J \\supset (I,b),\\ J$ is principal. Argue that $I = Jc$ and so is principal.) For generalizations of such Kaplansky-style Zorn Lemma arguments see papers cited here. Below is an interesting reference on multiplication rings.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is: Prove that an integral domain where every prime ideal is principal is a principal ideal domain (PID). \n\nFirst, I need to recall some definitions. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity that has no zero divisors. A principal ideal domain is an integral domain where every ideal is principal, meaning each ideal can be generated by a single element. The problem states that if every prime ideal in such a domain is principal, then the entire ring must be a PID. \n\nHmm, so the key here is to show that all ideals, not just the prime ones, are principal. The given condition is about prime ideals, so maybe I need to relate arbitrary ideals to prime ideals somehow. \n\nI remember that in ring theory, one approach to showing a ring is a PID is to use the fact that every ideal is finitely generated and that the ring is a Noetherian. But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about Noetherian rings. Maybe another strategy is needed.\n\nAnother thought: in a ring where every prime ideal is principal, perhaps we can use some kind of induction on the ideals. For example, if every proper ideal is contained in a prime ideal, and if those prime ideals are principal, maybe we can build up the principal nature of all ideals from there. But I need to be careful here. \n\nWait, there's a theorem called the Cohen's theorem which states that a ring is Noetherian if every prime ideal is finitely generated. But in our case, the prime ideals are not just finitely generated but principal. So maybe this ring is Noetherian. If that's the case, then perhaps we can use the fact that in a Noetherian ring, every ideal contains a product of prime ideals or something like that. \n\nBut wait, the problem is about integral domains, not necessarily Noetherian. So maybe a different approach is needed. Let me think about the structure of ideals in such a domain. \n\nSuppose R is our integral domain where every prime ideal is principal. Let I be any non-zero ideal of R. We need to show that I is principal. If I is prime, then by assumption it's principal. If I is not prime, then there must exist some elements a and b in R such that ab is in I but neither a nor b is in I. But how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the concept of prime avoidance or some kind of maximality argument. Let's consider the set of ideals that are not principal. If this set is non-empty, then by Zorn's lemma, there must be a maximal element (assuming the ring has some conditions, like being Noetherian). But again, we don't know if the ring is Noetherian. \n\nWait, but if every prime ideal is principal, maybe every ideal is a product of principal prime ideals? In a Dedekind domain, every ideal factors into prime ideals, but Dedekind domains are Noetherian. But again, we don't know if our ring is Dedekind. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use localization. If R has all prime ideals principal, then localizing at a prime ideal would give us a local ring with a principal maximal ideal. Local rings with principal maximal ideals are valuation rings, which are Bézout domains. But I'm not sure how this helps globally. \n\nAnother angle: Let's suppose that R is not a PID. Then there exists an ideal I that is not principal. Let's consider a maximal such ideal I with respect to inclusion. If we can show that such an I must be prime, then it would contradict the assumption that all prime ideals are principal. Hence, such an I cannot exist, so R is a PID. \n\nThis seems like a promising approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Assume R is an integral domain where every prime ideal is principal.\n2. Suppose, for contradiction, that R is not a PID. Then there exists a non-principal ideal.\n3. Consider the collection of all non-principal ideals. Under the assumption that this collection is non-empty, apply Zorn's lemma to find a maximal element I (i.e., an ideal I maximal with respect to not being principal).\n4. Show that such an ideal I must be prime. \n5. However, by the initial assumption, all prime ideals are principal, which contradicts I being non-principal.\n6. Therefore, no such I exists, so R must be a PID.\n\nBut to make this rigorous, I need to verify that the poset of non-principal ideals has a maximal element. For Zorn's lemma, we need that every chain of non-principal ideals has an upper bound. Suppose we have a chain of non-principal ideals. Their union is an ideal, and if the union were principal, then all ideals in the chain would be contained in a principal ideal. But in that case, if the union is generated by a single element, then each ideal in the chain would be generated by that element, making them principal, which contradicts the chain consisting of non-principal ideals. Therefore, the union is also non-principal, so Zorn's lemma applies, giving a maximal non-principal ideal I.\n\nNext, we need to show that I is prime. Suppose that a and b are elements not in I such that ab is in I. Consider the ideals (I, a) and (I, b). Since I is maximal among non-principal ideals, (I, a) and (I, b) must be principal. Let’s say (I, a) = (x) and (I, b) = (y). Then, since ab is in I, we have that (I, a)(I, b) = (xy) is contained in I. But I is contained in both (I, a) and (I, b), so perhaps we can show that I = (xy), which would mean I is principal, contradicting its choice. Therefore, the assumption that a and b are not in I leads to a contradiction, so one of a or b must be in I, hence I is prime. \n\nBut since all prime ideals are principal by assumption, this contradicts I being non-principal. Therefore, our initial assumption that there exists a non-principal ideal is false, so R is a PID.\n\nThis seems like a valid proof. Let me check if all steps are justified. \n\nFirst, the application of Zorn's lemma: the union of a chain of non-principal ideals is non-principal. If the union were principal, generated by some element, then every element in the union is a multiple of that generator. Since the chain is ascending, eventually all ideals in the chain would be generated by that element, making them principal, which contradicts the chain consisting of non-principal ideals. So yes, the union is non-principal, so Zorn's lemma applies.\n\nNext, the part where (I, a) and (I, b) are principal. Since I is maximal non-principal, any ideal properly containing I must be principal. Therefore, (I, a) and (I, b) are principal.\n\nThen, their product (I,a)(I,b) is contained in I. But (I,a)(I,b) = (xy), so (xy) ⊆ I. Also, I is contained in both (I,a) and (I,b), so I is contained in their intersection. However, in a domain, the product of two ideals is contained in their intersection. Wait, but (xy) is contained in I. If I is contained in (xy), then I = (xy), which would mean I is principal, contradiction. \n\nBut why is I contained in (xy)? Let's see. Since (I,a) = (x), then x divides every element of (I,a), so x divides i + ra for any i ∈ I, r ∈ R. Similarly for y. But how to get I contained in (xy)? Maybe consider that since ab ∈ I, and I is contained in both (x) and (y), then x divides some element of I and y divides some element of I. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, consider that (I,a)(I,b) = I² + aI + bI + abR. Since ab ∈ I, this becomes I² + aI + bI + I = I² + aI + bI. But since I is contained in both (I,a) and (I,b), which are principal, maybe there's a relation here. \n\nAlternatively, since (I,a) = (x), then x generates (I,a), so x divides a and x divides every element of I. Similarly, y divides b and every element of I. Therefore, x and y both divide elements of I. Since I is an ideal, and x divides elements of I, then x divides some generator of I, but I is not principal. Hmm, maybe this is getting too convoluted. \n\nWait, perhaps a different approach. If (I,a) = (x), then I = x*(something). But I is not principal. Maybe not. Alternatively, since (I,a) is principal, say generated by x, then x divides every element of I and divides a. Similarly, (I,b) = (y) implies y divides every element of I and divides b. Since I is contained in (x) and (y), then every element of I is a multiple of x and y. Since R is a domain, x and y must divide each other, so x and y are associates? Not necessarily, unless they are both generators of principal ideals containing I. \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe there's a more straightforward way. Suppose that (I,a) = (x) and (I,b) = (y). Then, since I is contained in both (x) and (y), we can write I = xJ = yK for some ideals J and K. But since R is a domain and x and y are elements, J and K would have to be ideals as well. However, if I is not principal, then J and K can't be principal either, but this line of reasoning might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, consider that since (I,a) = (x), then x must be in I or in a. But x generates I and a, so x could be a common divisor. Wait, if x generates (I,a), then x divides a and x divides every element of I. Similarly, y divides b and every element of I. Then, since ab is in I, x divides ab, but x divides a, so x divides a, hence x divides ab, which is in I. Similarly, y divides ab. But since R is a domain, if x and y are coprime, then xy divides ab, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since (I,a)(I,b) = (x)(y) = (xy), and this product is contained in I, which is contained in both (x) and (y). So xy divides every element of I. But since I is contained in (x), every element of I is a multiple of x, say i = x*i'. Similarly, since I is contained in (y), i = y*i''. Therefore, x*i' = y*i''. Since R is a domain, x and y must divide each other, hence x and y are associates. Therefore, (x) = (y). \n\nThen, since (x) contains I and a, and (y) = (x) contains I and b, so both a and b are in (x). Therefore, a = x*a' and b = x*b' for some a', b' in R. Then ab = x^2*a'b', which is in I. But I is contained in (x), so x divides ab = x^2*a'b', hence x divides x^2*a'b', which is trivial. \n\nBut we have ab ∈ I. Since I is contained in (x), then ab = x*c for some c ∈ R. But ab = x^2*a'b', so x*c = x^2*a'b', implying c = x*a'b'. Therefore, ab = x^2*a'b' = x*c, which is in I. But then I contains x^2*a'b', which is in (x^2). If I is contained in (x), then I = x*J for some ideal J. If J is principal, then I would be principal, which contradicts. Therefore, J is not principal. But J is an ideal of R, and since I is maximal non-principal, J must be principal. Hence, I = x*J would be principal, contradiction. \n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exist a and b not in I with ab in I must be false. Hence, I is prime. But by the problem's assumption, all prime ideals are principal, so I is principal, which contradicts the choice of I as non-principal. Hence, no such I exists, so R is a PID. \n\nOkay, that seems to check out. So the key steps are using Zorn's lemma to get a maximal non-principal ideal, showing that such an ideal must be prime, and then contradicting the assumption that all prime ideals are principal. Therefore, the original statement is proved.",
