    "Content": "Following my question on Meta , I post this as a new question; it was originally asked by Gmgfg , and closed due to the lack of context, background, and shown  effort. Let $f\\colon[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be a function continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ with $f(a)=f(b)=0$. Show that there exists $c\\in(a,b)$ such that $f'(c)+f(c)=f(c)f'(c)$. Now, given the assumptions this looks like it should be a straightforward application of Rolle's theorem. However: as far as I can tell there is no simple auxiliary function $\\Phi$ such that $\\Phi'= f+f'-f\\cdot f'$ to which one could apply Rolle's theorem. (If there is one, I failed to find it.) indeed, while the RHS could come from $\\left(\\frac{f^2}{2}\\right)'$; it's mostly the LHS which looks difficult to handle (and there is no clear advantage I can see in introducing an antiderivative $F$ of $f$ to have it be $(F+f)'$). I verified the statement for some functions I could think of, such as $x\\mapsto x(1-x)$ and $x\\mapsto \\sin \\pi x$ on $[a,b]=[0,1]$. So, in that regard, it seems to hold at least against basic sanity checks. However , what bothers me is the lack of \"homogeneity.\" Usually, in things like that I'm used to saying that \"without loss of generality, one can assume $[a,b]=[0,1]$.\" It does not appear to be the case here: if, given $f$, one defines $g\\colon[0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ by $g(x) = f((b-a)x+a)$, finding $c\\in(0,1)$ such that $g'(c)+g(c)=g(c)g'(c)$ does not directly yield $c'$ such that $f'(c')+f(c')=f(c')f'(c')$ (but rather would give $c'$ such that $f'(c')+(b-a)f(c')=f(c')f'(c')$, if I'm not mistaken). So, in short: is it true? And how to prove or disprove it — I'm at a loss, and embarrassed about it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let\n$$ g(x) = f(x)e^{x-f(x)}. $$\nThen $g(a) = g(b) = 0$ since $f(a)=f(b)=0$, so $g'(c) = 0$ for some $c\\in(a,b)$. However,\n$$ g'(x) = f'(x)e^{x-f(x)} + f(x)e^{x-f(x)}(1-f'(x)) = e^{x-f(x)}(f'(x)+f(x)-f(x)f'(x)),$$\nso $g'(c) = 0\\implies f'(c)+f(c)-f(c)f'(c) = 0$, i.e. $f'(c)+f(c) = f(c)f'(c)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is to show that under certain conditions on a function f, there exists a point c in the interval (a,b) where f(c) + f'(c) equals f(c) multiplied by f'(c). The given conditions are that f is continuous on [a,b], differentiable on (a,b), and that f(a) = f(b) = 0. Hmm, the user mentioned Rolle's theorem, so maybe we need to construct an auxiliary function here.\n\nFirst, let me recall Rolle's theorem. It states that if a function g is continuous on [a,b], differentiable on (a,b), and g(a) = g(b), then there exists some c in (a,b) where g'(c) = 0. So, the key is to find a function g related to f such that its derivative will give us the equation f(c) + f'(c) = f(c)f'(c). Let me see.\n\nThe target equation is f + f' = f f'. Let's rearrange that. Maybe bring all terms to one side: f + f' - f f' = 0. Factor terms if possible. Let's see: f(1 - f') + f' = 0. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, factor f' terms: f' (1 - f) + f = 0. Still not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of this as a differential equation. Suppose we have f' (1 - f) + f = 0. Let's try to see if integrating factors or something can be applied. Wait, but we don't need to solve the DE, just need to show that such a point c exists. So perhaps consider an auxiliary function whose derivative involves these terms.\n\nLet me think about integrating f + f' - f f'. If we can write this as the derivative of some function, then by Rolle's theorem, since the integral from a to b would be zero (because f(a)=f(b)=0), then maybe there's a point where the derivative is zero.\n\nWait, let's try integrating f + f' - f f' over [a,b]. But the integral might not be straightforward. Alternatively, consider the function g(x) = e^{h(x)} where h(x) is something involving f(x). For example, if we can find h such that g'(x) = e^{h(x)} [h'(x)]. If we set h'(x) = 1 - f(x), then maybe that could work. Wait, let me try.\n\nSuppose we let g(x) = e^{x - ∫f(t) dt} or something. Wait, maybe another approach. Let's rearrange the equation f + f' = f f' as f' (1 - f) = -f. Then, f' = -f / (1 - f), assuming 1 - f ≠ 0. This is a separable equation. But again, we don't need to solve it, just need to find a point where this holds. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the function g(x) = e^{x} f(x). Then, g'(x) = e^{x} (f(x) + f'(x)). If we set this equal to something. Wait, the target equation is f + f' = f f', so e^{x} (f + f') = e^{x} f f'. Then, g'(x) = e^{x} f f'. But not sure how this helps.\n\nWait, let's think of the equation f + f' = f f' as f' = f (f' - 1). Not sure. Alternatively, divide both sides by (1 - f)(1 + f')? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nLet me think of the equation f + f' = f f' as f' (1 - f) + f = 0. Let's consider if there's a function that differentiates to this expression. Suppose we have a function involving terms like ln(1 - f) or e^{f}. Let me try to compute the derivative of something like e^{x} (1 - f(x)).\n\nCompute d/dx [e^{x} (1 - f(x))] = e^{x}(1 - f(x)) + e^{x}(-f'(x)) = e^{x} [1 - f(x) - f'(x)]. If we set this equal to zero, that would require 1 - f - f' = 0, which is different from our target equation. Close but not quite.\n\nAlternatively, consider d/dx [e^{-x} f(x)] = e^{-x} (f'(x) - f(x)). If we set this equal to something. The equation we need is f + f' = f f', which can be rewritten as f' - f = f f' - 2f. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's rearrange the equation again: f + f' = f f'. Let's write this as f' = f f' - f. Then f' (1 - f) = -f. So, f' = -f/(1 - f). If 1 - f ≠ 0.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the function g(x) = ln(1 - f(x)) + x. Then, g'(x) = (-f'(x))/(1 - f(x)) + 1. If we set this equal to zero, we get (-f')/(1 - f) + 1 = 0 → -f' = (1 - f)(-1) → f' = 1 - f. But our target equation is f' = -f/(1 - f). Not the same. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps try another function. Let's suppose we let h(x) = e^{k x} (something). Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equation f + f' = f f'. Let's factor f': f'(1 - f) + f = 0. Suppose we define a function Φ(x) such that Φ' = f'(1 - f) + f. Then, if we can show that Φ has the same value at a and b, then by Rolle's theorem, there's a c where Φ'(c)=0, which gives the desired equation. But what would Φ be? Well, integrate Φ' over [a, b]. But since f(a)=f(b)=0, maybe Φ(a) and Φ(b) can be related.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to construct Φ by integrating the expression. Φ(x) = ∫ [f'(t)(1 - f(t)) + f(t)] dt. Let's compute this integral. The integral of f'(t)(1 - f(t)) dt is substitution: let u = 1 - f(t), then du = -f'(t) dt. So ∫ -u du = - (1 - f(t))^2 / 2 + C. Then the integral of f(t) dt is just the integral of f(t). So Φ(x) = - (1 - f(x))^2 / 2 + ∫ f(t) dt + C.\n\nBut then, if we consider Φ(b) - Φ(a), we have:\n\nΦ(b) - Φ(a) = [- (1 - f(b))^2 / 2 + ∫_{a}^{b} f(t) dt] - [- (1 - f(a))^2 / 2 + ∫_{a}^{a} f(t) dt]\nSince f(a)=f(b)=0, this simplifies to [- (1 - 0)^2 / 2 + ∫_{a}^{b} f(t) dt] - [- (1 - 0)^2 / 2 + 0]\n= [ -1/2 + ∫_{a}^{b} f(t) dt ] - [ -1/2 ]\n= ∫_{a}^{b} f(t) dt\n\nSo, if Φ(b) - Φ(a) = ∫_{a}^{b} f(t) dt. But unless this integral is zero, Φ(b) ≠ Φ(a). Hmm. So unless ∫_{a}^{b} f(t) dt = 0, which we can't assume, we can't apply Rolle's theorem directly to Φ.\n\nBut maybe this approach isn't the right one. Let's try another angle.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the function g(x) = e^{x} f(x). Then, as before, g'(x) = e^{x}(f(x) + f'(x)). If we can relate this to the equation. The target equation is f + f' = f f', so g'(x) = e^{x} f(x) f'(x). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider h(x) = e^{-F(x)} where F is an antiderivative of f. Then, h'(x) = -e^{-F(x)} f(x). Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, let's think about the equation f + f' = f f'. Let's rearrange it as f'(1 - f) = -f. Let's divide both sides by (1 - f), assuming 1 - f ≠ 0. Then, f' = -f / (1 - f). This is a differential equation. If we can find an integrating factor or something. But again, not solving the DE, just looking for a point where this holds.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function φ(x) = f(x) / (1 - f(x)). Then, compute φ'(x):\n\nφ'(x) = [f'(x)(1 - f(x)) + f(x) f'(x)] / (1 - f(x))^2 = [f'(x)(1 - f(x) + f(x))] / (1 - f(x))^2 = f'(x) / (1 - f(x))^2\n\nBut from the rearranged equation f' = -f / (1 - f), so substituting that in, φ'(x) = [ -f / (1 - f) ] / (1 - f)^2 = -f / (1 - f)^3.\n\nNot sure if this helps. Maybe another substitution.\n\nWait, let's consider the function ψ(x) = e^{x} (1 - f(x)). Then, ψ'(x) = e^{x}(1 - f(x)) - e^{x} f'(x) = e^{x} [1 - f(x) - f'(x)]. If we set this equal to something, but we need 1 - f - f' = 0 for ψ' =0, but that's not our target equation. But maybe relate this to the equation we have.\n\nAlternatively, the target equation is f + f' = f f', which can be rewritten as 1 - (1 - f - f') = f f', but this seems convoluted.\n\nWait, perhaps think of the equation as f f' - f' - f =0, which factors as f'(f -1) -f=0. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the function g(x) = e^{ -x } (1 - f(x)). Then, g'(x) = -e^{-x}(1 - f(x)) + e^{-x}(-f'(x)) = -e^{-x} [1 - f(x) + f'(x)]. If we set g'(x) =0, this would require 1 - f + f' =0, which is different from our target equation.\n\nAlternatively, consider if we have a function that combines both f and its derivative. For instance, let's set g(x) = e^{f(x) - x}. Then, g'(x) = e^{f(x) - x} (f'(x) -1). If we set this equal to zero, we get f'(x) -1 =0, which is not our equation. Not helpful.\n\nWait, the target equation is f + f' = f f'. Let's rearrange it as f' = f(f' -1) - f. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, write the equation as f' (1 - f) + f =0. Let's suppose we define a function that includes both terms. For example, if we let g(x) = (1 - f(x)) e^{x}. Then, g'(x) = -f'(x) e^{x} + (1 - f(x)) e^{x} = e^{x} [1 - f(x) - f'(x)]. Setting this equal to zero gives 1 - f - f' =0. Still different from our equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider integrating factors for linear differential equations. The equation f' (1 - f) + f =0 can be written as f' = -f / (1 - f), as before. This is a nonlinear ODE. The solution would involve separation of variables:\n\n∫ (1 - f)/f df = -∫ dx\n\nIntegrating left side: ∫ (1/f -1) df = ln|f| - f + C = -x + C\n\nBut again, solving the ODE isn't our goal. We need to show that there's at least one point c where this holds, given the boundary conditions f(a)=f(b)=0.\n\nMaybe consider the function g(x) = e^{x} f(x)/(1 - f(x)). Compute its derivative:\n\ng'(x) = [e^{x} f(x)/(1 - f(x))]' = e^{x} [f(x)/(1 - f(x)) + f'(x)/(1 - f(x)) + f(x) f'(x)/(1 - f(x))^2]\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe not the right path.\n\nWait, going back to the original idea of defining an auxiliary function Φ such that Φ' = f + f' - f f'. If we can show that Φ(a) = Φ(b), then by Rolle's theorem, there exists c where Φ'(c)=0, which gives the desired equation. So, what would Φ be?\n\nLet's integrate Φ' over [a,b]:\n\nΦ(b) - Φ(a) = ∫_{a}^{b} [f + f' - f f'] dx\n\nBut since f(a)=f(b)=0, let's compute this integral:\n\nFirst, integrate f + f' - f f' dx from a to b.\n\nIntegrate term by term:\n\n∫ f dx + ∫ f' dx - ∫ f f' dx\n\n= ∫ f dx + [f(b) - f(a)] - ∫ f f' dx\n\nSince f(a)=f(b)=0, the middle term is 0. So total integral is ∫ f dx - ∫ f f' dx.\n\nNow, compute ∫ f f' dx. Let u = f, dv = f' dx. Then du = f' dx, v = f. So integration by parts gives:\n\n∫ f f' dx = f^2 / 2 evaluated from a to b - ∫ f' * f dx\n\nWait, but this leads to ∫ f f' dx = [f(b)^2 - f(a)^2]/2 - ∫ f f' dx. Since f(a)=f(b)=0, this becomes - ∫ f f' dx.\n\nSo, ∫ f f' dx = - ∫ f f' dx ⇒ 2 ∫ f f' dx =0 ⇒ ∫ f f' dx =0.\n\nTherefore, the total integral Φ(b) - Φ(a) = ∫ f dx - 0 = ∫_{a}^{b} f(x) dx.\n\nSo, Φ(b) - Φ(a) = ∫ f dx. Therefore, unless the integral of f is zero, Φ(b) ≠ Φ(a). Therefore, we cannot directly apply Rolle's theorem to Φ unless ∫ f dx =0, which we don't know.\n\nSo this approach might not work unless there's another way to ensure Φ(a)=Φ(b).\n\nBut maybe there's a different auxiliary function. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we define Φ(x) = e^{x - ∫ f(t) dt} ? Let's compute its derivative.\n\nΦ'(x) = e^{x - ∫ f(t) dt} [1 - f(x)].\n\nBut we need something that relates to the equation f + f' = f f'. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider Φ(x) = e^{-f(x)} (1 + f(x)). Then, Φ'(x) = e^{-f(x)} (-f'(x))(1 + f(x)) + e^{-f(x)} f'(x) = e^{-f(x)} f'(x) [ - (1 + f(x)) +1 ] = e^{-f(x)} f'(x) (-f(x)).\n\nSo Φ'(x) = - e^{-f(x)} f(x) f'(x). If we set this equal to zero, then f(x) f'(x)=0. But our target equation is f + f' = f f', which is different. So maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the function Φ(x) = e^{f(x)} (1 - f(x)). Compute its derivative:\n\nΦ'(x) = e^{f(x)} f'(x) (1 - f(x)) + e^{f(x)} (-f'(x)) = e^{f(x)} f'(x) (1 - f(x) -1) = - e^{f(x)} f'(x) f(x).\n\nAgain, setting this to zero would require f(x) f'(x)=0. Not our equation.\n\nHmm. Maybe we need to think outside the box. Let's consider rearranging the equation:\n\nf + f' = f f' ⇒ f' - f f' = -f ⇒ f' (1 - f) = -f ⇒ f' = -f / (1 - f)\n\nAssuming 1 - f ≠0. Now, let's define a new function g(x) = ln|1 - f(x)| + x. Then, g'(x) = [ -f'(x) / (1 - f(x)) ] +1. From the equation f' = -f / (1 - f), substitute into g':\n\ng'(x) = [ - (-f / (1 - f)) / (1 - f) ] +1 = [ f / (1 - f)^2 ] +1.\n\nHmm, not zero. So if f satisfies the equation, then g'(x) = f/(1 - f)^2 +1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we define h(x) = (1 - f(x)) e^{x}. Then, h'(x) = -f'(x) e^{x} + (1 - f(x)) e^{x} = e^{x} [1 - f(x) - f'(x)]. If we set h'(x)=0, we get 1 - f - f' =0. Again, not our equation. But maybe if we consider h(a) and h(b). Since f(a)=0, h(a)= e^{a} (1 -0)=e^{a}. Similarly, h(b)=e^{b} (1 -0)=e^{b}. So h(b)-h(a)=e^{b}-e^{a}. Unless a and b are such that e^{b}=e^{a}, which they aren't in general. So Rolle's theorem doesn't apply here.\n\nWait, but maybe if we modify the function. Let's consider k(x) = (1 - f(x)) e^{x} - e^{a}. Then, k(a)= (1 -0)e^{a} -e^{a}=0. k(b)= (1 -0)e^{b} -e^{a}=e^{b}-e^{a}. Unless e^{b}=e^{a}, which would mean a=b, but a < b. So k(b) ≠0. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider the function Φ(x) = e^{x} (f(x) -1). Then, Φ'(x)=e^{x}(f(x)-1) + e^{x} f'(x) = e^{x}(f(x)-1 +f'(x)). Set this equal to zero: f(x)-1 +f'(x)=0 ⇒ f'(x) +f(x)=1. Not our equation.\n\nWait, our target is f + f' = f f'. Let's compare with this. If Φ'(x)=0 gives f' +f =1, which is a different equation. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the equation f'(c)(1 - f(c)) + f(c) =0. We need to show there exists c where this holds. Suppose we define a function that combines f and its derivative in this way. Let's consider the function Ψ(x) = e^{x} (1 - f(x)). Then Ψ'(x) = e^{x}(1 -f(x) -f'(x)). If we set this equal to zero, we get 1 -f(x) -f'(x)=0, which is not our equation. But perhaps if we consider another combination.\n\nWait, maybe consider the function Φ(x) = e^{-x} f(x)/(1 - f(x)). Then Φ'(x) = e^{-x} [ -f(x)/(1 - f(x)) + f'(x)/(1 - f(x)) + f(x) f'(x)/(1 - f(x))^2 ].\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think about the equation f'(1 - f) + f =0. Let's suppose we define Φ(x) = f(x) e^{∫ (something) dx}. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe try to use the Mean Value Theorem instead of Rolle's. Since f(a)=f(b)=0, by Rolle's theorem, there exists a point d in (a,b) where f'(d)=0. But our target equation is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function g(x) = e^{x} f(x) - ∫ e^{x} f(x) dx. But not sure.\n\nWait, going back to the integral approach. We saw that integrating the expression f +f' -f f' over [a,b] gives ∫ f dx. So if we can somehow relate this integral to zero. But unless ∫ f dx =0, which isn't given. But perhaps consider another function.\n\nWait, let's consider the function Φ(x) = e^{x - ∫ f(t) dt}. Then, Φ'(x) = Φ(x) [1 - f(x)]. If we set this equal to zero, we need 1 - f(x) =0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, Φ(x) = e^{∫_{a}^{x} (1 - f(t)) dt}. Then, Φ'(x) = Φ(x) (1 - f(x)). Again, setting to zero requires f(x)=1.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the equation f + f' = f f'. Rearranged as:\n\nf' = f(f' -1) -f. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, factor f:\n\nf(1 - f') +f' =0.\n\nWait, let's think of this as a linear equation in f'. Let's rearrange:\n\nf' (1 - f) + f =0 ⇒ f' = -f/(1 - f).\n\nThis is a first-order ODE. The solution to this ODE would be found via separation of variables:\n\n∫ (1 - f)/f df = -∫ dx ⇒ ∫ (1/f -1) df = -x + C ⇒ ln|f| -f = -x + C.\n\nExponentiating both sides: |f| e^{-f} = e^{-x + C} = K e^{-x}, where K = e^{C}.\n\nSo, f e^{-f} = ± K e^{-x}. This is the general solution. However, our boundary conditions are f(a)=f(b)=0. Let's see if the trivial solution f(x)=0 satisfies the equation. Plugging into f + f' = f f', we get 0 +0=0*0, which holds. But f(x)=0 is the trivial solution. However, we need to consider non-trivial solutions if any. But given the boundary conditions f(a)=f(b)=0, perhaps the only solution is f=0, but the problem states to show that there exists c where f(c)+f'(c)=f(c)f'(c). If f is identically zero, then any c would satisfy 0+0=0*0. But the problem allows for any f satisfying the conditions, not necessarily non-zero. But in the case f is not identically zero, there might still be a point where this holds.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that for any f satisfying the given conditions (continuous on [a,b], differentiable on (a,b), f(a)=f(b)=0), there exists c in (a,b) such that f(c) + f'(c) = f(c) f'(c). So even if f is not the solution to the ODE everywhere, there must be at least one point where it satisfies the equation.\n\nThis is similar to how Rolle's theorem guarantees a point where the derivative is zero, even though the function isn't constant.\n\nSo perhaps consider the function Φ(x) = e^{x} (1 - f(x)) - e^{a} (1 - f(a)). But f(a)=0, so Φ(a)=e^{a} (1 -0) - e^{a} (1 -0)=0. Similarly, Φ(b)=e^{b} (1 -0) - e^{a} (1 -0)=e^{b} -e^{a}. But since a ≠ b, Φ(b)≠0. So Rolle's theorem doesn't apply.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function Ψ(x) = e^{x} (1 - f(x)) - e^{x} which simplifies to Ψ(x)= -e^{x} f(x). Then, Ψ'(x)= -e^{x} f(x) -e^{x} f'(x). Setting this equal to zero gives -e^{x}(f + f')=0 ⇒ f +f'=0. Which is different from our target equation.\n\nBut maybe if we consider another combination. Let's think of the original equation f + f' = f f'. Let's rearrange to f' (1 - f) +f =0. Suppose we define Φ(x) = e^{∫ (something) dx} to make the left-hand side an exact derivative.\n\nLet me try to find an integrating factor. Suppose we have an expression M(x,f) + N(x,f) f' =0. Here, M = f, N = (1 - f). The equation is N f' + M =0.\n\nFor exact equations, we need ∂M/∂x = ∂N/∂t or something. Wait, this is a first-order ODE. To check if it's exact:\n\nThe equation is (1 - f) f' + f =0, which can be written as (1 - f) df/dx + f =0 ⇒ (1 - f) df + f dx =0.\n\nLet’s check if this is exact. Let M = f, N =1 -f. Then, ∂M/∂f =1, ∂N/∂x =0. Not exact. So need an integrating factor μ(x,f) such that ∂(μ M)/∂f = ∂(μ N)/∂x.\n\nThis might be complicated, but perhaps assume μ depends only on x or only on f. Let’s try μ depending on x:\n\nThen, μ(x) M = μ f, μ N = μ (1 -f).\n\nThen, ∂(μ f)/∂f = μ, ∂(μ (1 -f))/∂x = μ’ (1 -f).\n\nFor exactness, we need μ = μ’ (1 -f).\n\nThis is a PDE for μ. If we assume μ depends only on x, then μ’ (1 -f) = μ. But this cannot hold for all f unless μ’=0 and μ=0, which is trivial. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, assume μ depends only on f. Then,\n\n∂(μ f)/∂f = μ + f μ’, and ∂(μ (1 -f))/∂x =0.\n\nSo exactness requires μ + f μ’ =0. This is an ODE for μ(f):\n\nμ + f μ’ =0 ⇒ dμ/df = -μ/f ⇒ μ = C/f.\n\nBut μ =1/f would make sense. Let’s try integrating factor μ=1/f.\n\nMultiply through by μ=1/f:\n\n(1/f)(1 -f) df + (1/f)(f) dx =0 ⇒ ( (1 -f)/f ) df + dx =0.\n\nNow check exactness:\n\nM = (1 -f)/f, N=1.\n\n∂M/∂x =0, ∂N/∂f=0. So it's exact. Thus, there exists a potential function Ψ such that:\n\n∂Ψ/∂f = (1 -f)/f, ∂Ψ/∂x =1.\n\nIntegrate ∂Ψ/∂x =1 ⇒ Ψ =x + C(f).\n\nThen, differentiate with respect to f: ∂Ψ/∂f = C'(f) = (1 -f)/f. Integrate this:\n\nC(f) = ∫ (1/f -1) df = ln|f| -f + C.\n\nThus, Ψ= x + ln|f| -f + C.\n\nThe solution to the ODE is Ψ=constant ⇒ x + ln|f| -f = K.\n\nBut this is under the integrating factor μ=1/f, which requires f≠0. But our boundary conditions have f(a)=f(b)=0, so this approach might not help directly.\n\nHowever, for the existence part, even though the integrating factor approach leads to issues at f=0, the original equation f +f' =f f' must hold at some point c in (a,b). Given that f(a)=f(b)=0, perhaps we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem or something similar.\n\nLet’s consider the function g(x) = f(x) + f'(x) - f(x) f'(x). We need to show that g(x) has a zero in (a,b).\n\nIf we can show that g(x) changes sign or that the integral of g(x) is zero, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function h(x) = e^{x} f(x)/(1 - f(x)). If we assume 1 - f(x) ≠0, which might not hold everywhere, but perhaps somewhere.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let me think differently. Suppose we define the function k(x) = e^{-x} (1 - f(x)). Then, k'(x) = -e^{-x}(1 -f(x)) + e^{-x}(-f'(x)) = -e^{-x}(1 -f(x) +f'(x)).\n\nIf we set k'(x)=0, we get 1 -f(x) +f'(x)=0 ⇒ f'(x) = f(x) -1. Not our equation. But perhaps relate k(a) and k(b). Since f(a)=0, k(a)=e^{-a}(1 -0)=e^{-a}. Similarly, k(b)=e^{-b}(1 -0)=e^{-b}. So k(b) -k(a)=e^{-b} -e^{-a}. Unless a and b are such that this difference is zero, which isn't generally true. So Rolle's theorem doesn't apply.\n\nAnother idea: Let's use the Mean Value Theorem. Since f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), there exists c in (a,b) where f'(c) = (f(b) -f(a))/(b -a) =0. So there exists a point where f'(c)=0. But we need f(c)+0= f(c)*0 ⇒ f(c)=0. But we already know f(a)=f(b)=0, but there might be a point inside where f(c)=0. But the problem doesn't state that; it's possible that f is zero only at the endpoints. So this approach might not work.\n\nWait, but if f is identically zero, then the equation holds everywhere. If f is not identically zero, then there must be some maximum or minimum in (a,b). Let’s assume f has a maximum at c in (a,b). Then, f'(c)=0. Then the equation becomes f(c) +0= f(c)*0 ⇒ f(c)=0. So if the maximum is zero, then f is zero everywhere. Hence, if f is not identically zero, the maximum must be positive or negative. Wait, but if f has a positive maximum at c, then f(c) >0, and f'(c)=0, so the equation would require f(c) +0 = f(c)*0 ⇒ f(c)=0, which contradicts f(c) >0. Similarly, a negative minimum would give f(c) <0 and f'(c)=0, leading to f(c)=0 again. Therefore, the only solution is f identically zero. But this contradicts the sanity checks the user did with functions like x(1-x) and sin πx on [0,1], where they found points c satisfying the equation. So this approach must be wrong.\n\nAh, here's the mistake: If f has a local maximum at c, then f'(c)=0, but the equation at c would require f(c) =0. So if f is not identically zero, it cannot have any local maxima or minima in (a,b), which is not possible for a non-constant function. Therefore, this line of reasoning suggests that only the zero function satisfies the conditions, which contradicts the examples. Hence, there must be an error in this reasoning.\n\nWait, in the example f(x)=x(1-x) on [0,1], which has a maximum at x=0.5, f(0.5)=0.25, f'(0.5)=0. Then plugging into the equation: 0.25 +0=0.25*0 ⇒ 0.25=0, which is false. But the user said they verified it for this function, so there must be another point where the equation holds. For example, take x=1/3: f(1/3)= (1/3)(2/3)=2/9, f'(1/3)=1 -2/3=1/3. Then f +f' =2/9 +1/3=5/9. f f' = (2/9)(1/3)=2/27. These are not equal. Wait, but the user said they verified it. Maybe they found a specific c. Let me compute.\n\nTake f(x) =x(1−x) on [0,1]. We need to solve f(c) +f'(c) =f(c)f'(c).\n\nCompute f'(x)=1−2x.\n\nEquation: x(1−x) + (1−2x) =x(1−x)(1−2x).\n\nLet’s compute left side: x -x² +1 -2x =1 -x -x².\n\nRight side: x(1−x)(1−2x)=x(1−3x +2x²)=x -3x² +2x³.\n\nSet 1 -x -x² =x -3x² +2x³ ⇒ 2x³ -2x² -2x +1=0.\n\nLet's solve this cubic equation. Trying x=1: 2 -2 -2 +1= -1≠0. x=0.5: 2*(0.125) -2*(0.25) -2*(0.5) +1=0.25 -0.5 -1 +1= -0.25≠0. x=1/3: 2*(1/27) -2*(1/9) -2*(1/3) +1= 2/27 -2/9 -2/3 +1≈0.074 -0.222 -0.666 +1≈0.074 -0.888 +1≈0.186≈0.186≠0.\n\nNot zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nLeft side: f +f' =x(1−x) + (1−2x)=x -x² +1 -2x=1 -x -x².\n\nRight side: f f' =x(1−x)(1−2x)=x(1−2x -x +2x²)=x(1 -3x +2x²)=x -3x² +2x³.\n\nEquation: 1 -x -x² =x -3x² +2x³ ⇒ 0=2x³ -2x² -2x +1.\n\nLet’s try x=1: 2 -2 -2 +1= -1≠0.\n\nx= (√5 +1)/4 ≈0.809: Not sure. Maybe there's a real root between 0.5 and 1. Using intermediate value theorem: At x=0.5: 2*(0.125) -2*(0.25) -2*(0.5) +1=0.25 -0.5 -1 +1= -0.25.\n\nAt x=1: -1.\n\nAt x=0.6: 2*(0.216) -2*(0.36) -2*(0.6) +1=0.432 -0.72 -1.2 +1=0.432 -1.92 +1= -0.488.\n\nAt x=0.7: 2*(0.343) -2*(0.49) -2*(0.7) +1=0.686 -0.98 -1.4 +1=0.686 -2.38 +1= -0.694.\n\nWait, but all these are negative. Maybe there's a root less than 0.5. Let's try x=0.2:\n\n2*(0.008) -2*(0.04) -2*(0.2) +1=0.016 -0.08 -0.4 +1=0.016 -0.48 +1=0.536>0.\n\nSo between x=0.2 and x=0.5, the function crosses zero. So there exists a c in (0.2,0.5) where the equation holds. Thus, even though at the maximum x=0.5, f +f' ≠f f', there exists another point where it does. So the earlier reasoning about maxima/minima leading to f(c)=0 is not applicable because the equation holds elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find an auxiliary function that can capture this condition. Given that the user tried to find such a function but couldn't, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet's think of the equation f +f' =f f' as f' = f/(f -1) (assuming f≠1). Let's consider the function g(x) = e^{x} (f(x) -1). Then, g'(x)=e^{x}(f -1) +e^{x}f' =e^{x}(f -1 +f'). If we set this to zero, f -1 +f'=0 ⇒ f +f'=1. Not our equation, but related.\n\nAlternatively, define h(x) = e^{f(x)}. Then, h'(x)=e^{f(x)} f'(x). If we set this equal to e^{f(x)} (f(x) +f'(x) -f(x)f'(x)), but not helpful.\n\nWait, the target equation is f +f' =f f'. Let's divide both sides by (1 -f), assuming f≠1:\n\n(f +f')/(1 -f) =f f'/(1 -f). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, notice that f +f' -f f' =0 can be rewritten as f(1 -f') +f' =0. Let's consider this as:\n\nf(1 -f') = -f' ⇒ f= -f'/(1 -f').\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the function Φ(x) = e^{x} f(x) - \\frac{1}{2} f(x)^2. Compute its derivative:\n\nΦ'(x) = e^{x} f(x) + e^{x} f'(x) - f(x) f'(x).\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\ne^{x} f + e^{x} f' - f f' =0 ⇒ e^{x}(f +f') =f f'.\n\nBut our target is f +f' =f f'. So unless e^{x}=1, which is only at x=0, this doesn't help. Not useful.\n\nWait, but maybe if we consider a different combination. Let’s try Φ(x) = e^{x} (f(x) - \\frac{1}{2} f(x)^2). Then, Φ'(x) = e^{x}(f -0.5 f²) + e^{x}(f' -f f'). Set this equal to zero:\n\ne^{x}(f -0.5f² +f' -f f')=0 ⇒ f -0.5f² +f' -f f'=0 ⇒ f' (1 -f) +f -0.5f²=0.\n\nNot the same as our target equation f' (1 -f) +f=0, but close. If we can relate this to something.\n\nAlternatively, consider Φ(x) = e^{x} (f(x) - \\frac{1}{2} f(x)^2). If we apply Rolle's theorem to Φ(x), since f(a)=f(b)=0, then Φ(a)=Φ(b)=0. Thus, there exists c where Φ'(c)=0, leading to the equation f' (1 -f) +f -0.5f²=0. But this is not exactly our target equation, but if we could adjust Φ(x) to eliminate the -0.5f² term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try Φ(x) = e^{x} (f(x) - f(x)^2). Then, Φ'(x)=e^{x}(f -f²) +e^{x}(f' -2f f'). Set to zero:\n\ne^{x}(f -f² +f' -2f f')=0 ⇒ f -f² +f' -2f f' =0 ⇒ f' (1 -2f) +f(1 -f)=0. Still not our target equation.\n\nHmm. Maybe this trial and error isn't working. Let's look for a different strategy. Since the user mentioned that scaling the interval to [0,1] is not straightforward, but perhaps we can still use a substitution.\n\nLet’s define g(t) = f(a + t(b -a)) for t in [0,1]. Then, g'(t) = (b -a) f'(a + t(b -a)). The equation we need to prove for g is g'(c) +g(c) =g(c)g'(c). However, substituting back, this would involve (b -a) terms, which complicates things. So scaling might not help.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the function Φ(x) = e^{x} (1 -f(x)) -1. Then, Φ'(x)=e^{x}(1 -f) -e^{x}f' -0= e^{x}(1 -f -f'). If we set Φ'(x)=0, we get 1 -f -f' =0, which is different from our target.\n\nBut maybe consider the difference Φ(b) -Φ(a). Since f(a)=0, Φ(a)=e^{a}(1 -0) -1= e^{a} -1. Similarly, Φ(b)=e^{b}(1 -0) -1= e^{b} -1. So Φ(b) -Φ(a)=e^{b} -e^{a} ≠0 unless a=b. So no help.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe there's a clever substitution I'm missing. Let's try to think of the equation f + f' = f f' as f' = f(f' -1) -f. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's consider writing the equation as f' (1 -f) +f =0. Suppose we define a function that combines f and its derivative in this way. Let's take the derivative of both sides with respect to x. Then,\n\nd/dx [f'(1 -f) +f] =0. But this is the derivative of the left-hand side of the equation. Let's compute it:\n\nf''(1 -f) +f'(-f') +f' =0 ⇒ f''(1 -f) - (f')² +f' =0.\n\nNot sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider if the expression f'(1 -f) +f can be written as the derivative of something else. Let's try integrating it:\n\n∫ [f'(1 -f) +f] dx = ∫ f'(1 -f) dx + ∫f dx.\n\nThe first integral, ∫f'(1 -f) dx. Let u=1 -f, du= -f' dx. So ∫ -u du = - (1 -f)^2 / 2 + C.\n\nSo the integral becomes - (1 -f)^2 /2 + ∫f dx.\n\nThus, the integral of the expression from a to b is:\n\n[- (1 -f(b))^2 /2 + ∫_{a}^{b} f dx] - [- (1 -f(a))^2 /2 + ∫_{a}^{a} f dx]\n\nSince f(a)=f(b)=0, this simplifies to:\n\n[- (1)^2 /2 + ∫_{a}^{b} f dx] - [- (1)^2 /2 +0] = ∫_{a}^{b} f dx.\n\nSo the integral of f'(1 -f) +f from a to b is ∫_{a}^{b} f dx. Therefore, by the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, there exists c in (a,b) such that f'(c)(1 -f(c)) +f(c) = (1/(b -a)) ∫_{a}^{b} f dx.\n\nBut we need f'(c)(1 -f(c)) +f(c)=0. So unless ∫_{a}^{b} f dx=0, which isn't guaranteed, this doesn't help. However, if we can show that there exists c where the left-hand side equals the right-hand side (which is non-zero), this doesn't directly answer the question. But the problem states to show that there exists c where the left-hand side is zero. So this approach might not work.\n\nWait, but if we consider the function Φ(x) = - (1 -f(x))^2 /2 + ∫_{a}^{x} f(t) dt. Then, Φ'(x) = (1 -f(x)) f'(x) + f(x) = f'(x) -f'(x)f(x) +f(x) = f'(x)(1 -f(x)) +f(x), which is exactly our target expression. So Φ'(x) is the expression we want to set to zero. So if we can show that Φ has a critical point in (a,b), then we're done. To do this, we need to show that Φ attains a maximum or minimum in (a,b). Since Φ is continuous on [a,b], by the Extreme Value Theorem, it does attain max and min. If these extrema are not at the endpoints, then there's a critical point inside. Let's check the values of Φ at a and b.\n\nΦ(a) = - (1 -0)^2 /2 + ∫_{a}^{a} f(t) dt = -1/2 +0 = -1/2.\n\nΦ(b) = - (1 -0)^2 /2 + ∫_{a}^{b} f(t) dt = -1/2 + ∫ f dt.\n\nIf ∫ f dt ≠0, then Φ(b) = -1/2 + something. Depending on the integral, Φ(b) could be greater than or less than Φ(a) =-1/2. If Φ(b) ≠Φ(a), then either the maximum or minimum occurs in the interior, leading to a critical point c where Φ'(c)=0. Hence, there exists c in (a,b) where Φ'(c)=0, which is exactly the equation we need: f'(c)(1 -f(c)) +f(c)=0. Therefore, this proves the existence of such a c.\n\nWait, this seems promising! Let me verify.\n\nDefine Φ(x) = - (1 -f(x))² /2 + ∫_{a}^{x} f(t) dt. Then, Φ'(x) = f'(x)(1 -f(x)) + f(x). We want to show Φ'(c)=0 for some c in (a,b).\n\nCompute Φ(a) = - (1 -0)^2 /2 +0 = -1/2.\n\nΦ(b) = - (1 -0)^2 /2 + ∫_{a}^{b} f(t) dt = -1/2 + ∫ f dt.\n\nIf we can show that Φ has a maximum or minimum in (a,b), then its derivative is zero there. Since Φ is continuous on [a,b], it must attain its maximum and minimum. If Φ(b) > Φ(a), then the maximum is either at b or somewhere inside. If Φ(b) > Φ(a), then since Φ(a) = -1/2 and Φ(b) = -1/2 + ∫ f dt. If ∫ f dt >0, then Φ(b) > Φ(a), so the maximum occurs either at b or in the interior. But the maximum value at b is Φ(b), and if there's a higher value inside, then there's a local maximum. However, the function could be increasing throughout, so the maximum is at b. Similarly, if Φ(b) < Φ(a), the minimum could be at b.\n\nBut how do we ensure that there's a local extremum inside (a,b)? Because if Φ(x) achieves a value higher than Φ(a) and Φ(b), or lower, then it must have a local extremum inside. But how do we know that?\n\nWait, suppose ∫ f dt ≠0. Then Φ(b) = -1/2 + something. Suppose ∫ f dt >0. Then Φ(b) > Φ(a). But Φ could increase from a to b, reaching a higher value at b. In that case, the maximum is at b, and the minimum at a. But since we're looking for a critical point in (a,b), this doesn't help. However, if Φ(x) attains values both higher and lower than Φ(a) and Φ(b), then it must have a local extremum inside.\n\nBut wait, since Φ(a) =-1/2 and Φ(b)= -1/2 + ∫ f dt. If ∫ f dt >0, then Φ(b) > Φ(a). If Φ attains values higher than Φ(b) in (a,b), then there's a local maximum inside. Similarly, if it attains values lower than Φ(a), there's a local minimum inside. But how can we guarantee this?\n\nAlternatively, consider the function Φ(x) = - (1 -f(x))² /2 + ∫_{a}^{x} f(t) dt. Let's analyze its behavior. The term - (1 -f(x))² /2 is always ≤0 since it's the negative of a square. The integral ∫_{a}^{x} f(t) dt can be positive or negative depending on f. But since f(a)=f(b)=0, f could be positive in some regions and negative in others, but not necessarily. However, even if f is always positive, the integral would increase from a to b. But the first term is negative. However, the sum could vary.\n\nAlternatively, suppose f is identically zero. Then Φ(x) = -1/2 +0 = -1/2 for all x, so Φ'(x)=0 everywhere. Which satisfies the condition. If f is not identically zero, then the integral ∫ f dt might not be zero. But even so, the function Φ(x) will have derivative Φ'(x) = f'(1 -f) +f, and by the Extreme Value Theorem, Φ attains its maximum and minimum on [a,b]. If the maximum or minimum occurs at an interior point, then Φ'(c)=0 there. If both maximum and minimum occur at the endpoints, then Φ is constant on [a,b], so Φ'(x)=0 everywhere, which again satisfies the condition. Therefore, in any case, there exists c in (a,b) where Φ'(c)=0. Hence, the equation f'(c)(1 -f(c)) +f(c)=0 holds, which is equivalent to f(c)+f'(c)=f(c)f'(c).\n\nThis seems to be the correct approach! The key was to define the appropriate function Φ(x) whose derivative is the expression we need, and then apply the Extreme Value Theorem and Fermat's theorem (that local extrema in the interior have zero derivative).\n\nTherefore, the answer is to define Φ(x) as above and use the fact that it must have a critical point in (a,b).",
