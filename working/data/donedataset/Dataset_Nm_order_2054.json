    "Content": "There is a relative compactness criterion for subset of $\\ell^p$ that seems to me to be almost unheard-of (I say that because a google search provided no proofs nor references) but that is very useful: Theorem. For any $p$, $1\\leq p < \\infty$, a bounded subset $K$ of $\\ell^p$ is relatively compact if and only if $\\displaystyle\\lim_{n_\\epsilon} \\sum_{i=n_\\epsilon}^\\infty \\vert k_i \\rvert^p = 0$, uniformly for $k \\in K$. This theorem is assigned as exercise in Diestel (see below) and is widely applied in Costara-Popa in order to prove relative compactness in $\\ell^p$ (a classical example is to show that the operator $T : \\ell^p \\to \\ell^p$ defined by $( T a )_n = \\lambda_n a_n$ for all $a \\in \\ell^p$ is compact iff $(l_n) \\in c_0$). However, I founded its proof rather tricky. My idea is essentially showing that a subset such as in theorem is totally bounded. (since in this way the result follows by well-established equivalence between totally boundeness and relative compactness in metric spaces.) Thus, chosen $\\epsilon >0$, I was looking for a finite collection $S$ of vectors in $\\ell^p$ such that every vector in $K$ is far from at last one vector in $S$ less than $\\epsilon$. \nThe condition in theorem means that, fixed $\\eta > 0$, there exists $n_\\eta \\in \\mathbb N$ s.t. $\\sum_{i=n}^\\infty \\lvert k_i \\rvert^p < \\eta^p$ and $n_\\eta$ is the same for all $k \\in K$ (depending only on $\\eta$). Furthermore, since $K$ is bounded, there exists $M>0$ s.t. $\\lVert k \\rVert_p \\leq M$ for all $k\\in K$. So I'd consider a collection of vectors $u^{(j)}$ that have only $n_\\eta$ non-zero components and set their values in such a way that \\begin{equation}\n\\lVert k- u^{(j)} \\rVert_ p^p = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \\rvert^p =\\sum_{i=1}^{n_\\eta} \\lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \\rvert^p + \\sum_{i=n_\\eta}^\\infty \\lvert k_i \\rvert^p < \\epsilon^p\n\\end{equation} Since the second summation in the third term is less than $\\eta^p$ (and $\\eta$ could be arbitrary small, in particular smaller than $\\epsilon$), it remains only to show that it is possible to have $\\sum_{i=1}^{n_\\epsilon} \\lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \\rvert^p \\leq \\epsilon^p - \\eta^p$. Set $r^p = \\frac{\\epsilon^p - \\eta^p}{n_\\eta ( M+1 ) }$ and choose $N \\in \\mathbb N$ s.t. $Nr^p \\geq M$. Suppose that each component of $u^{(j)}$ takes one of the $2N + 1$ values $0, \\pm r^p, \\pm 2r^p, \\dots, \\pm N r^p$. Since $-M \\leq k_i \\leq M$ for every $i \\leq n_\\eta$, there exists an integer $C$ with $-N + 1 \\leq C \\leq N$ s.t. $(C - 1 )r^p \\leq k_i \\leq C r^p$. Then set $u_i^{(j)} = C r^p$. Thus\n\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n_\\epsilon} \\lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \\rvert^p < \\epsilon^p - \\eta^p\n\\end{equation} by construction. Now, the number of different vectors $u^{(j)}$ we can construct in this way is finite when $\\eta$ and $\\epsilon$ are fixed, hence $K$ is totally bounded. I think this attempt works (I have adapted the proof of compactness of Lipschitz functions space in bounded functions space found in an italian book of mathematical analysis), but at the same time it seems to be rather messy. I valued other possibilities (such as apply the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem), but this one appeared to be the most promising. So I wonder if there are other clearer proofs or references in which this theorem is proved. References. J. Diestel, Sequences and series in Banach spaces , chp 1, ex 6, C. Costara, D.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "We get a shorter proof if we use the characterization of totally bounded sets given here , a set $K$ is totally bounded if and only if for every $\\varepsilon > 0$ there is a compact set $C$ such that $d(x,C) < \\varepsilon$ for all $x \\in K$. Then, for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ consider the projection $$P_n \\colon \\ell^p \\to \\ell^p;\\quad P_n(x)_m = \\begin{cases}x_m &; m \\leqslant n\\\\ 0 &, m > n. \\end{cases}$$ For the given $K$, and $\\varepsilon > 0$ choose $n_\\varepsilon$ such that $$\\sum_{n = n_\\varepsilon}^\\infty \\lvert k_n\\rvert^p < \\varepsilon^p/2$$ for all $k \\in K$. Then let $C = \\overline{P_{n_\\varepsilon}(K)}$. $C$ is a closed and bounded set in a finite-dimensional space, hence compact. By choice of $n_\\varepsilon$, we have $\\lVert k -P_{n_\\varepsilon}(k)\\rVert_p < \\varepsilon$ for all $k \\in K$, and $P_{n_\\varepsilon}(k) \\in C$. So the criterion is satisfied, hence $K$ is totally bounded. This criterion for relative compactness in $\\ell^p$ is the easier cousin of the theorem of Fréchet and Kolmogorv characterising the relatively compact sets in the $L^p$ spaces.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user is talking about a relative compactness criterion in ℓ^p spaces. The main theorem they mention is that a bounded subset K of ℓ^p is relatively compact if and only if the limit of the sum from n_ε to infinity of |k_i|^p is zero uniformly for k in K. \n\nSo the assumptions here would be the conditions given for the theorem. Let's list them one by one. The problem is to prove this theorem. \n\nFirst assumption: The subset K is in ℓ^p space. Next, K is bounded. Then, for the condition given, the limit of the tail sums uniformly converges to zero. Each of these should be separate. So:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a subset of ℓ^p,\n1 ≤ p < ∞,\nK is bounded,\nFor every ε > 0, there exists n_ε ∈ ℕ such that ∑_{i=n_ε}^∞ |k_i|^p < ε for all k ∈ K.\n\nProblem: Prove that K is relatively compact in ℓ^p.\n\nWait, but the theorem states the equivalence. However, in the original question, the user is focusing on proving that the given condition implies relative compactness. The problem as stated in the title is about the criterion, which is an \"if and only if,\" but the user's approach is to show that the condition implies relative compactness. However, in the example provided by the user, the problem was structured to have the assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 under certain assumptions. \n\nIn this case, the problem is to prove the theorem. The theorem states that for a bounded subset K of ℓ^p, it's relatively compact iff the tail sums go to zero uniformly. The user is focusing on the proof, particularly the direction where the tail condition implies relative compactness. However, the problem as per the user's own structuring in the example only lists the necessary assumptions and the problem. The example had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo here, the theorem is an equivalence, but the user's proof idea is for one direction. But the way the problem is presented in the Stack Exchange question is as a theorem to prove. So the formatted problem should capture the theorem's statement. So the assumptions would be:\n\nK is a subset of ℓ^p,\n1 ≤ p < ∞,\nK is bounded,\nFor every ε > 0, there exists n_ε ∈ ℕ such that ∑_{i=n_ε}^∞ |k_i|^p < ε uniformly for k ∈ K.\n\nBut the theorem is an equivalence. Wait, the problem is to prove the theorem. So perhaps the problem statement would be: Prove that a bounded subset K of ℓ^p is relatively compact if and only if the tail sums converge uniformly to zero. But the user's example structured the problem by listing the assumptions and then the problem. However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem but added in the formatted version. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted version, the user added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, that example might be incorrect. But according to the user's instruction, they provided an example where they structured the problem by listing the assumptions. But if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should just be n is an integer. However, the formatted example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like an error. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem in the example had a different condition. Wait, let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem in example:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's incorrect. But since the user provided that as their example, perhaps they intended to filter unrelated information. Maybe the original problem had an error, or perhaps the user made a mistake. However, I need to follow their format, regardless of correctness.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is talking about the theorem where the conditions are that K is bounded and satisfies the tail condition. So the problem is to prove the equivalence. But since the user is focusing on the direction of showing relative compactness given the tail condition, maybe the problem is to prove that if K is bounded and satisfies the uniform tail condition, then K is relatively compact. However, the theorem is an if and only if, but the problem as stated in the Stack Exchange question is about proving that theorem, so both directions. But the user's approach is to show that the condition implies totally bounded, hence relatively compact. So perhaps the problem is to prove one direction. But the theorem is stated as an equivalence.\n\nWait, but according to the example, the user extracted assumptions from the problem statement. So in the original problem, the assumptions might not be all explicitly stated. For example, in the example, perhaps the user considered that divisibility by 7 was necessary, even though the original problem didn't state it. But that might be a mistake. However, given that the example is structured that way, perhaps the task is to list all the conditions that are given in the problem as assumptions. In the current problem, the theorem says \"For any p, 1 ≤ p < ∞, a bounded subset K of ℓ^p is relatively compact if and only if lim_{n_ε} sum_{i=n_ε}^infty |k_i|^p = 0 uniformly for k in K.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- K is a subset of ℓ^p.\n\n- 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n\n- K is bounded.\n\n- For every ε > 0, there exists n_ε ∈ ℕ such that ∑_{i=n_ε}^∞ |k_i|^p < ε for all k ∈ K.\n\nBut the theorem is an equivalence. So the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, K is relatively compact. Wait, no. The \"if and only if\" requires both directions. But in the problem statement, the user is focusing on proving that the tail condition implies relative compactness. However, according to the original Stack Exchange question, the theorem is that a bounded subset K is relatively compact iff the tail condition holds. So to state this as a problem, we need to include both directions. However, the example given by the user only took one direction. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to structure the problem as the specific case. Maybe the original problem had a mistake, but the example was illustrative.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current case, the problem is to prove that a bounded subset K of ℓ^p is relatively compact if and only if the tail sums converge uniformly. So the assumptions would include that K is bounded and the tail condition. But since it's an equivalence, the problem would be to prove both directions. However, the user's approach is only for one direction. But according to the problem statement, the user is asking for help in proving the theorem, which is the equivalence. So the formatted problem should capture the entire theorem. But in terms of assumptions, the theorem's conditions are that K is bounded and satisfies the tail condition. However, since it's an equivalence, the problem would be to show the equivalence. But the example structured the problem as having certain assumptions and then the problem. So perhaps here, the problem is to prove that under the assumptions (K is a bounded subset of ℓ^p and satisfies the uniform tail condition), then K is relatively compact. Wait, but the theorem is an equivalence. Maybe the user's example is incorrect, but the task is to follow the format. Given that, I need to list the assumptions given in the problem. The problem states that for any p between 1 and infinity, a bounded subset K of ℓ^p is relatively compact iff the tail condition holds. So the problem is to prove this equivalence, and the assumptions would include K being a subset of ℓ^p, 1 ≤ p < ∞, K is bounded, and the tail condition. But since it's an if and only if, maybe the assumptions need to be split. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove one direction. However, the user is asking about the entire theorem. Given the example, which added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem statement. But in this case, the problem statement is the theorem itself. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a subset of ℓ^p,\n1 ≤ p < ∞,\nK is bounded,\nFor every ε > 0, there exists n_ε ∈ ℕ such that ∑_{i=n_ε}^∞ |k_i|^p < ε uniformly for all k ∈ K.\n\nProblem: Prove that K is relatively compact in ℓ^p.\n\nBut the theorem is an equivalence, so actually, the problem should be to prove that K is relatively compact if and only if it's bounded and satisfies the uniform tail condition. However, in the example, the user formatted the problem as only one direction. But perhaps the example was not correct. Anyway, following the user's instructions, they want to structure the problem as per the example. The example took an original problem that said \"for every integer n\" and added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which seems incorrect. However, perhaps the user made a mistake, but we have to follow their format. In the current problem, the theorem is the equivalence, but the user's approach is to show that the condition implies relative compactness, which is one direction. Therefore, the problem as per the user's question is to prove that if K is a bounded subset of ℓ^p and satisfies the uniform tail condition, then K is relatively compact. Hence, the assumptions would be the conditions required for that direction. So:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a subset of ℓ^p,\n1 ≤ p < ∞,\nK is bounded,\nFor every ε > 0, there exists n_ε ∈ ℕ such that ∑_{i=n_ε}^∞ |k_i|^p < ε uniformly for all k ∈ K.\n\nProblem: Prove that K is relatively compact in ℓ^p.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove the equivalence, then the problem statement would be to prove that K is relatively compact if and only if it is bounded and satisfies the uniform tail condition. However, in the original Stack Exchange question, the user is focusing on the proof of the theorem, which is an equivalence, but their attempt is for one direction. The problem title is \"A relative compactness criterion in ℓ^p\", and the theorem is stated as an equivalence. Therefore, the formatted problem should include both directions. However, the example provided by the user only took one direction (adding an assumption not in the original problem). Given that inconsistency, but following the user's instruction to structure as per their example, perhaps we should list the conditions given in the theorem as assumptions and then state the problem as proving the equivalence. However, in the example, the problem was to prove the divisibility under the listed assumptions. So perhaps here, the problem is to prove the equivalence under the given assumptions. But I need to check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem in the Stack Exchange question:\n\n\"Theorem. For any p, 1 ≤ p < ∞, a bounded subset K of ℓ^p is relatively compact if and only if lim_{n_ε} sum_{i=n_ε}^∞ |k_i|^p = 0 uniformly for k ∈ K.\"\n\nSo the theorem is an equivalence. Therefore, the problem is to prove this theorem. The assumptions here are the conditions given in the theorem. However, since it's an equivalence, the problem would require proving both directions. But how to structure this in the given format? The example given by the user only took one direction (incorrectly, perhaps). But according to the user's format, the assumptions are listed, and then the problem. In this case, the theorem's statement is that for a bounded subset K of ℓ^p, relative compactness is equivalent to the uniform tail condition. So the problem is to prove this equivalence. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- K is a subset of ℓ^p.\n\n- 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n\n- K is bounded.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that K is relatively compact if and only if the uniform tail condition holds.\n\nBut the user's example listed specific assumptions, including one that was not in the original problem (n divisible by 7). However, perhaps in the current case, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions are the general conditions (K is a subset of ℓ^p, 1 ≤ p < ∞, K is bounded), and the problem is to prove the equivalence between relative compactness and the uniform tail condition. But the user's format requires listing all assumptions line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a subset of ℓ^p,\n1 ≤ p < ∞,\nK is bounded.\n\nProblem: Prove that K is relatively compact in ℓ^p if and only if for every ε > 0, there exists n_ε ∈ ℕ such that ∑_{i=n_ε}^∞ |k_i|^p < ε uniformly for all k ∈ K.\n\nBut the original problem's theorem states the equivalence. So the problem is to prove this equivalence. However, the user's example might have structured the problem to have the conditions split into assumptions and problem. But in this case, the theorem's conclusion is the equivalence, so it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to prove one direction. The user's approach is to show that the tail condition implies relative compactness, so perhaps the problem is to prove that direction. Then the assumptions would include the tail condition. Let's check the original Stack Exchange question again. The user says:\n\n\"However, I found its proof rather tricky. My idea is essentially showing that a subset such as in theorem is totally bounded.\"\n\nSo the user is trying to prove that if K is bounded and satisfies the tail condition, then it's relatively compact. Therefore, the problem they are tackling is the \"if\" direction. So the problem is: Given a bounded subset K of ℓ^p that satisfies the uniform tail condition, prove that K is relatively compact. Hence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- K is a subset of ℓ^p,\n\n- 1 ≤ p < ∞,\n\n- K is bounded,\n\n- For every ε > 0, there exists n_ε ∈ ℕ such that ∑_{i=n_ε}^∞ |k_i|^p < ε uniformly for all k ∈ K.\n\nProblem: Prove that K is relatively compact in ℓ^p.\n\nThis seems to align with the user's approach. The original theorem is an equivalence, but the user is focusing on proving the sufficiency part (tail condition implies relative compactness). Therefore, structuring the problem as such. The user's example incorrectly added an assumption not in the original problem, but perhaps they intended to capture all necessary conditions. Given that, the formatted problem would list the conditions as assumptions and then the problem statement.",
