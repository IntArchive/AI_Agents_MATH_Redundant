    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this integral problem. The user wants to prove that the integral I equals (ln 2 -1)/4. Let me start by understanding the integral:\n\nI = ∫₀^{π/2} [sin³x log sin x] / sqrt(1 + sin²x) dx\n\nThey mentioned trying substitutions and differentiation under the integral sign but didn't get anywhere. Let me see possible approaches.\n\nFirst, maybe a substitution to simplify the integrand. The denominator sqrt(1 + sin²x) complicates things. Let me think about substituting t = sin x. Then dt = cos x dx. When x=0, t=0; x=π/2, t=1. The integral becomes:\n\n∫₀¹ [t³ log t] / sqrt(1 + t²) * (dt / sqrt(1 - t²))\n\nBecause cos x = sqrt(1 - t²), so dx = dt / cos x = dt / sqrt(1 - t²). So the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀¹ [t³ log t] / [sqrt(1 + t²) sqrt(1 - t²)] dt\n\nHmm, combining the square roots: sqrt((1 + t²)(1 - t²)) = sqrt(1 - t⁴). So the integral simplifies to:\n\n∫₀¹ [t³ log t] / sqrt(1 - t⁴) dt\n\nThat might be easier to handle. Let me write that down:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ t³ log t / sqrt(1 - t⁴) dt\n\nNow, perhaps another substitution. Let’s set u = t⁴. Then du = 4t³ dt, so t³ dt = du/4. Also, when t=0, u=0; t=1, u=1. Then the integral becomes:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ [log u^{1/4} / sqrt(1 - u)] * (du/4)\n\nBecause log t = log u^{1/4} = (1/4) log u. So substitute:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ (1/4 log u) / sqrt(1 - u) * (du/4) ?\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again. Original substitution:\n\nt = u^{1/4}, so log t = (1/4) log u. And sqrt(1 - t⁴) = sqrt(1 - u). The integral becomes:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ [ (u^{3/4}) (1/4 log u) ] / sqrt(1 - u) * (du/(4 u^{3/4}) )\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the substitution steps here. Let's backtrack.\n\nOriginal substitution after t to u: u = t⁴, so t = u^{1/4}, dt = (1/4) u^{-3/4} du. Then the integral:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ [t³ log t] / sqrt(1 - t⁴) dt = ∫₀¹ [ (u^{3/4}) * (1/4 log u) ] / sqrt(1 - u) * (1/4) u^{-3/4} du\n\nWait, t³ = u^{3/4 * 3} = u^{9/4}? No, wait t = u^{1/4}, so t³ = (u^{1/4})³ = u^{3/4}. Then log t = (1/4) log u. Then sqrt(1 - t⁴) = sqrt(1 - u). So the integral becomes:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ [u^{3/4} * (1/4 log u) ] / sqrt(1 - u) * (1/4) u^{-3/4} du\n\nBecause dt = (1/4) u^{-3/4} du. So multiplying all terms:\n\nt³ log t / sqrt(1 - t⁴) dt = [u^{3/4} * (1/4 log u) / sqrt(1 - u)] * (1/4 u^{-3/4}) du\n\nSimplify the u terms: u^{3/4} * u^{-3/4} = u^0 = 1. So:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ (1/4 log u) * (1/4) / sqrt(1 - u) du = (1/16) ∫₀¹ log u / sqrt(1 - u) du\n\nHmm, that seems better. So now the integral is (1/16) times the integral of log u over sqrt(1 - u) from 0 to 1. Let me check if that substitution is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different substitution would help. Let's think again. After substituting t = sin x, the integral became ∫₀¹ t³ log t / sqrt(1 - t⁴) dt. Maybe instead of substituting u = t⁴, we can use substitution v = 1 - t⁴. Let me try that.\n\nLet v = 1 - t⁴, so dv = -4 t³ dt. Then t³ dt = -dv / 4. The limits: when t=0, v=1; t=1, v=0. Then the integral becomes:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ [log t / sqrt(v)] * (-dv / 4) = (1/4) ∫₁⁰ [log t / sqrt(v)] (-dv) = (1/4) ∫₀¹ [log t / sqrt(v)] dv\n\nBut here, t is related to v: t = (1 - v)^{1/4}. So log t = (1/4) log(1 - v). Therefore:\n\nI = (1/4) ∫₀¹ [ (1/4) log(1 - v) / sqrt(v) ] dv = (1/16) ∫₀¹ log(1 - v) / sqrt(v) dv\n\nHmm, that's an interesting integral. Let me note that. So:\n\nI = (1/16) ∫₀¹ log(1 - v) / sqrt(v) dv\n\nBut this integral might be known or can be related to some standard integrals. Let me recall that ∫₀¹ log(1 - v) v^{k} dv can be expressed in terms of digamma functions or something. Alternatively, perhaps expanding log(1 - v) as a series.\n\nAlternatively, use substitution w = sqrt(v), so v = w², dv = 2w dw. Then the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀¹ log(1 - w²) / w * 2w dw = 2 ∫₀¹ log(1 - w²) dw\n\nBut wait, let's check:\n\nOriginal substitution:\n\nI_int = ∫₀¹ log(1 - v)/sqrt(v) dv. Let me set w = sqrt(v), so v = w², dv = 2w dw. Then:\n\nI_int = ∫₀¹ log(1 - w²)/w * 2w dw = 2 ∫₀¹ log(1 - w²) dw\n\nSo yes, that simplifies to 2 ∫₀¹ log(1 - w²) dw. Then:\n\nI = (1/16) * 2 ∫₀¹ log(1 - w²) dw = (1/8) ∫₀¹ log(1 - w²) dw\n\nNow, ∫₀¹ log(1 - w²) dw can be integrated by expanding the logarithm into a power series. Since log(1 - w²) = - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (w^{2n})/n for |w| < 1. So:\n\n∫₀¹ log(1 - w²) dw = - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) ∫₀¹ w^{2n} dw = - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) [1/(2n + 1)]\n\nSo:\n\n= - Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(n(2n + 1))\n\nHmm, this series needs to be evaluated. Let's see:\n\nWe can split the fraction into partial fractions. Let’s write 1/(n(2n + 1)) as A/n + B/(2n +1).\n\nMultiplying both sides by n(2n +1):\n\n1 = A(2n +1) + Bn\n\nLet n = -1/2: 1 = A(0) + B(-1/2) ⇒ B = -2.\n\nLet n = 0: 1 = A(1) + B(0) ⇒ A = 1.\n\nTherefore, 1/(n(2n +1)) = 1/n - 2/(2n +1)\n\nSo the sum becomes:\n\n- Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 2/(2n +1)] = - [ Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n - 2 Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2n +1) ]\n\nNote that Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n is the harmonic series which diverges, but here we have a combination that converges. Let's adjust the indices.\n\nLet’s write Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2n +1) = Σ_{k=3}^∞ 1/k where k is odd. Wait, maybe express in terms of Σ 1/n and Σ (-1)^{n+1}/n.\n\nAlternatively, note that Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 2/(2n +1)] can be rewritten as Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 2/(2n +1)].\n\nLet’s write this as:\n\nΣ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 2/(2n +1)] = Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 2/(2n +1)] = Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 2/(2n +1)]\n\n= Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 2/(2n +1)].\n\nLet’s compute this sum. Let me separate even and odd terms or look for telescoping. Alternatively, consider that:\n\nΣ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 2/(2n +1)] = Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 1/(n + 1/2)].\n\nBut perhaps express in terms of the digamma function. Alternatively, recall that Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 1/(n + a)] = ψ(a) + γ, but I might be getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, compute the sum up to N terms and take the limit as N→infty.\n\nLet’s write S_N = Σ_{n=1}^N [1/n - 2/(2n +1)]\n\n= Σ_{n=1}^N 1/n - 2 Σ_{n=1}^N 1/(2n +1)\n\n= (H_N) - 2 [ Σ_{k=3}^{2N +1} 1/k - 1/2 Σ_{k=2}^{2N} 1/k ]\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think of the second sum:\n\nΣ_{n=1}^N 1/(2n +1) = Σ_{m=3,5,...,2N+1} 1/m = Σ_{m=1}^{2N +1} 1/m - Σ_{m=1}^{1} 1/m - Σ_{m=2,4,...,2N} 1/m\n\n= H_{2N +1} - 1 - (1/2) Σ_{k=1}^{N} 1/k )\n\n= H_{2N +1} -1 - (1/2) H_N\n\nTherefore, substituting back into S_N:\n\nS_N = H_N - 2 [ H_{2N +1} -1 - (1/2) H_N ]\n\n= H_N - 2 H_{2N +1} + 2 + H_N\n\n= 2 H_N - 2 H_{2N +1} + 2\n\nNow, recall that H_{2N +1} = H_{2N} + 1/(2N +1). Also, H_{2N} = H_N + Σ_{k=1}^N 1/(N + k). But another approach: use the asymptotic expansion for harmonic numbers.\n\nH_n ≈ ln n + γ + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n²) + ...\n\nSo, H_{2N +1} ≈ ln(2N +1) + γ + 1/(4N +2) - ..., and H_N ≈ ln N + γ + 1/(2N) - ...\n\nTherefore, 2 H_N - 2 H_{2N +1} ≈ 2(ln N + γ) - 2(ln(2N +1) + γ) + ... = 2 ln N - 2 ln(2N +1) + ... ≈ 2 ln N - 2 ln(2N) - 2 ln(1 + 1/(2N)) + ... ≈ 2 ln N - 2 ln 2 - 2 ln N - 2*(1/(2N)) + ... = -2 ln 2 - 1/N + ... So as N→infty, this tends to -2 ln 2.\n\nTherefore, S_N ≈ -2 ln2 + 2 + terms that go to zero. Therefore, the limit as N→infty of S_N is 2 - 2 ln2.\n\nTherefore, the original sum Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 2/(2n +1)] = 2 - 2 ln2.\n\nTherefore, ∫₀¹ log(1 - w²) dw = - (2 - 2 ln2) = 2 ln2 - 2.\n\nThen going back:\n\nI = (1/8) * (2 ln2 - 2) = (2 ln2 - 2)/8 = (ln2 -1)/4.\n\nWhich matches the desired result. Therefore, the integral is indeed (ln2 -1)/4.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Substitute t = sin x, leading to an integral in terms of t.\n\n2. Substitute u = t⁴, leading to an integral involving log u / sqrt(1 - u).\n\n3. Substitute w = sqrt(v), changing variables to handle the integral as a series.\n\n4. Expand the logarithm into a series, integrate term by term, and compute the resulting sum using harmonic series properties.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user mentioned trying substitution y = sin²x and getting stuck with sin2x terms. However, the key steps here involve multiple substitutions and series expansion.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, the assumptions are about the integral's limits, the integrand's form, and possibly the substitution steps. Wait, but according to the example given, the assumptions are conditions on the variables or objects in the problem. For this integral problem, the assumptions would include the limits of integration, the integrand's expression, and any conditions required for convergence or differentiability.\n\nSo, parsing the original problem:\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\nProve that\nI = ∫₀^{π/2} [sin³x log sin x]/sqrt(1 + sin²x) dx = (ln 2 -1)/4.\n\nThe assumptions here would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to π/2.\n\n- The integrand is sin³x log sin x divided by sqrt(1 + sin²x).\n\n- The integration variable is x.\n\nBut the example given had assumptions listed as properties or conditions on the objects. In this case, the integral is definite with specified limits, and the integrand is a specific function. However, according to the example, the user split the problem's assumptions into separate lines. For instance, in the example, the user listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\".\n\nBut in this integral problem, the original problem does not have variables with conditions beyond the integral's structure. So maybe the assumptions here would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2].\n\nThe integrand is composed of sin³x multiplied by log sin x, divided by sqrt(1 + sin²x).\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were more about the conditions on variables. Since this integral is a specific definite integral without variables parameters, perhaps the only assumptions are the integral's structure and limits. But the example had two assumptions even when the original problem only mentioned \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem had an assumption \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem was:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should just be n is an integer, but the formatted problem added an extra condition. That seems like an error. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but in any case, following the user's example, they split the problem's original conditions into separate assumptions, even if the original problem didn't state them.\n\nBut in the current problem, the integral is given with specific limits and integrand. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to π/2.\n\nThe integrand is (sin³x log sin x)/sqrt(1 + sin²x).\n\nBut according to the user's example, they split into separate lines even if they're part of the same object. So each assumption line is one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\n\nThe upper limit of integration is π/2,\n\nThe integrand is sin³x multiplied by log sin x,\n\nThe denominator of the integrand is sqrt(1 + sin²x),\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is ∫₀^{π/2} [sin³x log sin x]/sqrt(1 + sin²x) dx.\n\nBut according to the example, they split into separate lines. For example, the original problem in the example had the expression for A(n), but in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems to add an extra assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example is wrong. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems like an error. However, the user provided that example, so perhaps in their formatting, assumptions include both the general conditions and any hidden ones. But maybe in the example, the user made a mistake, and the correct assumptions should only be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, since 91=13*7, perhaps the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is needed, but the original problem doesn't state that. This suggests that the example might have been incorrectly formatted. But regardless, following the user's example, even if it's incorrect, we need to structure the current problem similarly.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to prove that the integral equals (ln2 -1)/4. The assumptions here are the integral's setup: limits, integrand. But according to the user's example, they listed separate assumptions for each condition. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to π/2,\n\nThe integrand is sin³x multiplied by the natural logarithm of sin x,\n\nThe denominator of the integrand is the square root of (1 + sin²x),\n\nBut each of these should be separate lines. Alternatively, more precisely:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\n\nThe upper limit of integration is π/2,\n\nThe numerator of the integrand is sin³x log sin x,\n\nThe denominator of the integrand is sqrt(1 + sin²x),\n\nBut maybe even more atomic:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integration variable is x,\n\nThe integrand involves sin³x,\n\nThe integrand involves log sin x,\n\nThe denominator involves sqrt(1 + sin²x),\n\nThe integral is definite from 0 to π/2.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is computed over the interval [0, π/2],\n\nThe integrand contains the factor sin³x,\n\nThe integrand contains the factor log sin x,\n\nThe denominator of the integrand is sqrt(1 + sin²x),\n\nBut I think the user's example had two assumptions for the initial problem: n is integer, n divisible by 7. However, in the original problem, it was for every integer n, so the formatted problem in the example might have a mistake. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions are just the integral's structure as given. Since there are no variables with conditions other than the integral setup, the assumptions are the integral's definition.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to π/2,\n\nThe integrand is (sin³x log sin x)/sqrt(1 + sin²x),\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the integral equals (ln2 -1)/4.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So likely:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2],\n\nThe integrand is sin³x multiplied by the natural logarithm of sin x,\n\nThe denominator of the integrand is sqrt(1 + sin²x),\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that\n$$\nI=\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\sin^3 x\\log \\sin x}{\\sqrt{1+\\sin^2 x}}dx=\\frac{\\ln 2 -1}{4}.\n$$\n\nThis way, each part of the integral's setup is listed as a separate assumption.",
