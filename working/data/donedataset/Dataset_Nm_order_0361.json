    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can read a question from Math Stack Exchange, filter out unrelated info, and present it in the specified format with assumptions and the problem.\n\nFirst, looking at the example provided, the original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91. The formatted version listed assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumption, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an extra condition, but maybe that's part of the problem's hidden assumptions? Or perhaps the example had a typo. Hmm, maybe I need to check that. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which would restrict n. But maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nThe current problem is from Math Stack Exchange: Title: Triangle inequality for subtraction? Question: Why is |a - b| ≥ |a| - |b|?\n\nSo, I need to structure this into assumptions and the problem. The problem is asking for a proof or explanation of the inequality |a - b| ≥ |a| - |b|. \n\nNow, according to the format, assumptions should list all the conditions applied to one object each. So, what are the assumptions here? The triangle inequality usually holds for real numbers with absolute values. So, the assumptions would be that a and b are real numbers. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on a and b, so the only assumption is that a and b are real numbers. Wait, but in the triangle inequality, the standard form is |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|. The question here is about subtraction, so maybe the same applies. The inequality |a - b| ≥ |a| - |b| holds for all real numbers a and b. Therefore, the assumption is that a and b are real numbers. But do we need to state any other conditions? Like, maybe that |a| ≥ |b|? Wait, but the inequality |a - b| ≥ |a| - |b| holds regardless. If |a| < |b|, then the right-hand side would be negative, and since the left-hand side is always non-negative, the inequality would still hold. So, maybe the only assumption is that a and b are real numbers. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nb is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |a - b| ≥ |a| - |b|.\n\nBut let me check if there's any hidden assumption. The problem as stated doesn't mention any specific conditions on a and b, so the only assumptions are that a and b are real numbers. Each assumption is one line, one property applied to one object. So yes, each line is for a and b being real numbers.",
