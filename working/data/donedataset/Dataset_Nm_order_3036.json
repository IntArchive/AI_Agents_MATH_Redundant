    "Content": "I stumbled upon this problem on a chapter about group theory, and I can't seem to get a grasp on it: Let $p$ be a prime and $F_1 = F \n_2 = 1, F_{n +2} = F_{n +1} + F_n$ be the Fibonacci sequence. Show that $F_{2p(p^2−1)}$ is divisible by $p$. The book gives the following hint: Look at the group of $2×2$ matrices mod $p$ with determinant $± 1$ I know I have to use lagrange theorem at some point, but how do I stablish the link between the fibonacci sequence and the matrices? I mean, I know that there's a special $2×2$ matrix such that it yields the $n^{th}$ fibonacci number when taking the $n^{th}$ power, I even used it to obtain a general formula for the numbers during my linear algebra course, but how can I use that to prove this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Call the group $G = \\left\\{A \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^{2\\times 2} \\ \\middle\\vert\\ \\det A = \\pm 1\\right\\}$. First, we count the order of $G$. We have elements $\\left(\\array{a & b \\\\ c & d}\\right)$, with $a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ and $ad - bc \\equiv \\pm 1$ ($\\equiv$ means congruent modulo $p$).\nLet us first count the elements with determinant one. $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ is a field, which means that every element except $0$ has a multiplicative inverse. Therefore, $ad - bc \\equiv 1$ is equivalent to $(d \\equiv 0\\ \\land\\ c \\equiv -b^{-1})\\ \\lor\\ (a \\not\\equiv 0 \\land d \\equiv a^{-1}(1 + bc))$. Counting the possibilities gives\n$$ \\underbrace{(d \\equiv 0\\ \\land\\ c \\equiv -b^{-1})}_{\\text{$a$: $p$ choices, $b$: $p - 1$ choices}}\\ \\lor\\ \\underbrace{(a \\not\\equiv 0 \\land d \\equiv a^{-1}(1 + bc))}_{\\text{$a$: $p - 1$ choices, $b,c$: $p$ choices}} $$\nfor a total of $p(p-1) + (p-1)p^2 = p(p+1)(p-1) = p(p^2 - 1)$ elements with determinant $1$.\nBy symmetry (swapping $a$ with $b$ and $d$ with $c$) there has to be an equal number of elements with determinant $-1$. So the order of $G$ is $|G| = 2p(p^2 - 1)$. Now, let $M = \\left(\\array{1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0}\\right)$. You already know that $M^n = \\left(\\array{F_{n+1} & F_{n} \\\\ F_{n} & F_{n-1}}\\right)$. For $M$, as for any element in a finite group, we know that $M^{|G|} = I$ (consider the cyclic subgroup $\\left<M\\right>$ generated by $M$ and use Lagrange's theorem). This fact translates to\n$$ \\left(\\array{F_{2p(p^2 - 1) + 1} & F_{2p(p^2 - 1)} \\\\ F_{2p(p^2 - 1)} & F_{2p(p^2 - 1) - 1}}\\right) \\equiv \\left(\\array{1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1}\\right) \\mod{p}.$$\nThe off-diagonal components of this equation are what you wanted to show.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is about showing that a particular Fibonacci number, F_{2p(p²−1)}, is divisible by a prime p. The hint mentions using the group of 2x2 matrices modulo p with determinant ±1 and applying Lagrange's theorem. Hmm, I remember that Fibonacci numbers can be generated using matrix powers. Let me recall that.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence can be represented by the matrix [[1,1],[1,0]]. When you raise this matrix to the nth power, the top left entry is F_{n+1}, right? So, maybe if we consider this matrix modulo p, we can link the Fibonacci numbers modulo p to the order of this matrix in the group mentioned.\n\nThe group in question is the set of 2x2 matrices mod p with determinant ±1. Since p is prime, the determinant being ±1 mod p means those matrices are invertible, so they form a group under multiplication. The order of this group... Let me think. The general linear group GL(2,p) has order (p² -1)(p² - p). But here we have a subgroup where determinant is ±1. So, the determinant homomorphism maps to the multiplicative group mod p, which has order p-1. The kernel of determinant being ±1 would have size equal to the order of GL(2,p) divided by the size of the image. But the image here is the set {1, -1} mod p, assuming p ≠ 2. Wait, but determinant is allowed to be ±1, so the image is the subgroup {1, -1} in the multiplicative group. The multiplicative group mod p has order p-1, so the subgroup {1, -1} has order 2 if p is odd. So, the order of our group would be |GL(2,p)| / ( (p-1)/2 ). Wait, no. The determinant is a surjective homomorphism from GL(2,p) to the multiplicative group (which has order p-1). The group we're considering is the preimage of {1, -1} under det. So by the first isomorphism theorem, the order is |GL(2,p)| / ( (p-1)/2 )? Wait, no. The image here has size 2 (if p is odd), so the order of the subgroup would be |GL(2,p)| / ( (p-1)/2 ) )? Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nThe order of GL(2,p) is (p² -1)(p² - p). The determinant is a surjective map to GF(p)^*, which has order p-1. So, the kernel of the determinant map is SL(2,p), which has order (p² -1)(p² - p)/ (p-1) ) = (p² -1)p. But in our case, the group is matrices with determinant ±1. So, that's the preimage of the subgroup {1, -1} of GF(p)^*. So, the order should be [SL(2,p)] multiplied by the size of the subgroup {1, -1}. Since the determinant is surjective, the preimage of a subgroup of size k has order |SL(2,p)| * k. Since {1, -1} has size 2 when p is odd, the order of our group would be |SL(2,p)| * 2 = 2p(p² -1). Wait, SL(2,p) has order p(p² -1). So, multiplying by 2 gives 2p(p² -1). Therefore, the group in the hint has order 2p(p² -1). \n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in this group divides the group order. So, if we can show that the matrix [[1,1],[1,0]] has an order dividing 2p(p² -1), then its 2p(p² -1)th power would be the identity matrix modulo p. Then, looking at the top-left entry, which relates to F_{2p(p² -1) +1}, but maybe there's a shift here. Wait, the matrix power relation is:\n\n[[1,1],[1,0]]^n = [[F_{n+1}, F_n],[F_n, F_{n-1}]]\n\nSo, if we raise this matrix to the kth power modulo p and get the identity matrix, then the top-left entry would be F_{k+1} ≡ 1 mod p, and the entry below it would be F_k ≡ 0 mod p. Wait, but if the entire matrix is identity, then F_{k+1} ≡ 1 mod p, F_k ≡ 0 mod p, F_{k} ≡ 0 mod p, and F_{k-1} ≡ 1 mod p. Wait, that seems conflicting unless k is such that F_k ≡ 0 mod p and F_{k+1} ≡ 1 mod p. Which is similar to the period of Fibonacci numbers modulo p, called the Pisano period. But perhaps the exponent 2p(p² -1) is a multiple of the Pisano period, hence F_{2p(p² -1)} ≡ 0 mod p.\n\nBut maybe instead of the Pisano period, we use the group theory approach. Since the matrix M = [[1,1],[1,0]] has determinant -1. Because det(M) = (1)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. So modulo p, the determinant is -1 mod p, so M is in the group of matrices with determinant ±1. Therefore, the order of M in this group divides the group order, which is 2p(p² -1). Therefore, M^{2p(p² -1)} ≡ I mod p. Therefore, the matrix raised to that power is the identity matrix. Therefore, looking at the entry, M^{2p(p² -1)} = [[F_{2p(p² -1)+1}, F_{2p(p² -1)}], [F_{2p(p² -1)}, F_{2p(p² -1)-1}]] ≡ [[1,0],[0,1]] mod p. Therefore, F_{2p(p² -1)} ≡ 0 mod p. Therefore, p divides F_{2p(p² -1)}. That seems to be the link. So the key idea is that the matrix M is in the group, its order divides the group order, so when raised to that exponent, it's identity, so the corresponding Fibonacci number is 0 mod p. So the problem is essentially applying Lagrange's theorem to the matrix group, leading to the conclusion.\n\nBut let me verify the steps again. The group has order 2p(p² -1). The matrix M is in the group because determinant is -1. Therefore, M raised to the order of the group is identity. So, M^{2p(p² -1)} ≡ I mod p. Therefore, the (1,2) entry, which is F_{2p(p² -1)}, must be congruent to 0 mod p, and the (1,1) entry is F_{2p(p² -1)+1} ≡ 1 mod p. Therefore, this shows that F_{2p(p² -1)} ≡ 0 mod p, hence divisible by p.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include that p is a prime, the Fibonacci recurrence, and perhaps that the matrix M is in the group with determinant ±1. But in the problem statement, they already mention p is prime, and define the Fibonacci sequence. The hint says to look at that group. So the key assumptions are p is prime, Fibonacci numbers defined as per the recurrence, and the matrix with determinant -1 is in the group. So structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a prime.\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, and Fₙ₊₂ = Fₙ₊₁ + Fₙ for n ≥ 1.\n- Consider the group of 2×2 matrices modulo p with determinant ±1.\n- The matrix [[1, 1], [1, 0]] is an element of this group.\n\nProblem: Show that F_{2p(p²−1)} is divisible by p.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user mentions the hint about the group and matrices. However, when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions. The original problem states p is prime, defines the Fibonacci sequence, and the hint refers to the group. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n for all n ≥ 1.\n- The problem considers the group of 2×2 matrices modulo p with determinant ±1.\n\nThe problem is to show F_{2p(p²−1)} is divisible by p.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, assumptions were more about conditions on n. Here, the problem's assumptions include p being prime, the Fibonacci definition, and the group of matrices (as per the hint). However, the user wants each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a prime.\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₁ = 1.\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₂ = 1.\n- For all n ≥ 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.\n- The problem considers the group of 2×2 matrices modulo p with determinant ±1.\n\nBut maybe combining the Fibonacci definitions into one line, but according to the example, each assumption is one line. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So for the Fibonacci sequence, we need to split the definitions. However, the Fibonacci sequence is defined by three conditions: F₁=1, F₂=1, and the recurrence. Each could be separate assumptions. Alternatively, if the user's example separates different conditions even on the same object, then maybe each initial condition and the recurrence are separate.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a prime.\n- F₁ = 1.\n- F₂ = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n.\n- Consider the group of 2×2 matrices modulo p with determinant ±1.\n\nProblem: Show that F_{2p(p²−1)} is divisible by p.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement as given in the original question is \"Show that F_{2p(p²−1)} is divisible by p.\" So the formatted problem should have the problem as that. The assumptions need to list all the necessary conditions. The original problem mentions that p is a prime, the Fibonacci definition, and the hint about the group. So the group is part of the problem setup, hence an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \np is a prime,\n$F_1 = 1$,\n$F_2 = 1$,\nFor all integers $n \\geq 1$, $F_{n + 2} = F_{n + 1} + F_n$,\nConsider the group of $2 \\times 2$ matrices modulo $p$ with determinant $\\pm 1$.\nProblem: Show that $F_{2p(p^2 - 1)}$ is divisible by $p$.\n###",
