    "AcceptedAnswer": "A ring homomorphism $f: R \\to R'$ is injective if and only if its kernel is $\\{0\\}$ . Also, the kernel of a ring homomorphism is an ideal. Now let $f: K \\to R$ be a ring homomorphism from a field into a ring. The only ideals in a field $K$ are $\\{0\\}$ and $K$ itself. Hence $f$ can either have kernel $\\{0\\}$ or $K$ itself. In the former case, $f$ is injective, in the latter case it is the zero map. Hope this helps.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"How to prove that homomorphism from field to ring is injective or zero?\" and the question mentions it's a possible duplicate. The problem statement is to prove that a ring homomorphism from a field to a ring is either injective or the zero map.\n\nNow, applying the format. The Assumptions section should list all the conditions. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. There's a homomorphism f: K → R, where K is a field and R is a ring. So the first assumption is that K is a field.\n2. The second assumption is that R is a ring.\n3. The homomorphism f is a ring homomorphism. That's another assumption.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to different objects (K, R, f). The problem then is to prove that f is either injective or the zero map.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't explicitly state that K is a field and R is a ring, but since it's a homomorphism from a field to a ring, those are implicit. So the assumptions are:\n\n- K is a field.\n- R is a ring.\n- f: K → R is a ring homomorphism.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the Assumption section. The problem statement is to prove f is injective or zero. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The example included specific conditions on n, but here the conditions are about the structures involved. Each object (K, R, f) has its own property. That should fit the format correctly.",
