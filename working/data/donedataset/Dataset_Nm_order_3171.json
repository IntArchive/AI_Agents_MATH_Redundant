    "Content": "Can you prove the following new inequality? I found it experimentally. Prove that, for all $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n>0$ , it holds that $$\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{x_i}{\\sqrt[n]{x_i^n+(n^n-1)\\prod\\limits _{j=1}^nx_j}} \\ge\n1\\,.$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The inequality $\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{x_i}{\\sqrt[n]{x_i^n+(n^n-1)\\prod \\limits_{j=1}^nx_j}} \\ge 1$ is trivial given the claim below.  Of course, the equality occurs if and only if $x_1=x_2=\\ldots=x_n$. Claim: For\n   every $i=1,2,\\ldots,n$, we have $\\displaystyle\\frac{x_i}{\\sqrt[n]{x_i^n+\\left(n^n-1\\right)\\,\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j}}\n \\geq\n \\frac{x_i^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}}{\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}}$.  The equality holds if and only if\n   $x_1=x_2=\\ldots=x_n$. Proof: The required inequality is equivalent to $$\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}\\right)^n-x_i^{n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n^n}\\right)}\\geq \\left(n^n-1\\right)\\,x_i^{-\\frac{1}{n^{n-1}}}\\,\\prod_{j=1}^n\\,x_j\\,.$$\nNote that the expansion of $\\left(\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}\\right)^n$ consists of $n^n$ terms of the form $x_{j_1}^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}x_{j_2}^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}\\cdots x_{j_n}^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}$, where $j_1,j_2,\\ldots,j_n\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$.  The product of these terms is equal to $$\\left(\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}\\right)^{n^n}\\,.$$  If we take the term $x_i^{n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n^n}\\right)}$ out of the product, we get the product of $n^n-1$ terms from the expansion of $\\left(\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}\\right)^n-x_i^{n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n^n}\\right)}$, which is then equal to\n$$\\frac{\\left(\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}\\right)^{n^n}}{x_i^{n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n^n}\\right)}}=x_i^{-\\frac{1}{n^{n-1}}\\left(n^n-1\\right)}\\,\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{n^n-1}\\,.$$\nBy the AM-GM Inequality,\n$$\\frac{\\left(\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{1-\\frac{1}{n^n}}\\right)^n-x_i^{n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n^n}\\right)}}{n^n-1}\\geq \\left(x_i^{-\\frac{1}{n^{n-1}}\\left(n^n-1\\right)}\\,\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{n^n-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n^n-1}}=x_i^{-\\frac{1}{n^{n-1}}}\\,\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j\\,,$$\nwhich is what we want.  Hence, the claim is true.  The equality case happens, due to the AM-GM Inequality, if and only if $x_1=x_2=\\ldots=x_n$. How did I get the exponent $1-\\frac{1}{n^n}$? I assumed it was $k$ at first, and the desired inequality was equivalent to\n$$\\left(\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{k}\\right)^n-x_i^{nk}\\geq \\left(n^n-1\\right)\\,x_i^{n(k-1)}\\,\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j\\,.$$\nThen, the last inequality read\n$$\\frac{\\left(\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{k}\\right)^n-x_i^{nk}}{n^n-1}\\geq \\left(x_i^{-nk}\\,\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j^{n^nk}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n^n-1}}\\,,$$\nthe right-hand side of which I wanted to equal $x_i^{n(k-1)}\\,\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n\\,x_j$.  Therefore, $\\frac{n^nk}{n^n-1}=1$ and $n(k-1)=-\\frac{nk}{n^n-1}$, both of which gave me $k=1-\\frac{1}{n^n}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving an inequality involving positive real numbers and a product term in the denominator.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The user mentioned that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\nThe problem states \"for all $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n > 0$\". So the first assumption is that each $x_i$ is positive. But since there are multiple variables, should I list each one separately? The example given for the previous problem just listed \"$n$ is an integer\" once. Here, all $x_i$ are positive, so maybe the assumption is that all variables are positive, grouped together. But the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. However, in this case, the only condition given is that all $x_i$ are positive. There's no other condition like a specific value or divisibility. So the assumption here is simply that each $x_i$ is greater than zero.\n\nWait, the example had two assumptions for $n$: being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this problem, there's only one condition: positivity of all variables. So the assumption part should list each variable's condition. But since there are n variables, it's impractical to list each one. The user probably expects a concise statement covering all variables. So the assumption would be: \"For all $i$, $x_i > 0$\". But in the example, they wrote \"$n$ is an integer\", not for all $n$. Wait, in the example, the problem was about \"for every integer $n$\", so the assumption was $n$ is an integer. Here, the problem states \"for all $x_i > 0$\", so the assumption is that each $x_i$ is positive. So the assumption line would be: \"For each $i$, $x_i$ is positive.\" Or maybe \"All $x_i$ are positive.\" That's one assumption. Are there any other hidden assumptions? The problem is an inequality involving products and sums, so perhaps the variables are real numbers, but the problem states $x_i > 0$, so positivity is the only condition. So the assumption is that each $x_i$ is a positive real number. The problem itself is to prove the given inequality. So the formatted problem should have the assumption as \"For each $i$, $x_i > 0$\" and the problem statement as given.\n\nWait, looking back at the example, the original problem had \"for every integer $n$\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions were listed as \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user had \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem's assumption was that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example was from a different original problem? Maybe the user made a typo. But regardless, following the current problem, the user wants to structure the given inequality problem.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that for all positive $x_i$, the sum of each term $x_i$ divided by the nth root of $x_i^n + (n^n -1) \\prod x_j$ is at least 1. The assumptions here are that each $x_i$ is positive. There's no other condition given. So the assumptions are simply that each $x_i > 0$. Therefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: For each $i$, $x_i > 0$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{x_i}{\\sqrt[n]{x_i^n+(n^n-1)\\prod\\limits _{j=1}^nx_j}} \\ge 1.$$\n\nWait, the original problem's LaTeX had a missing parenthesis in the denominator: \\sqrt[n]{x_i^n+(n^n-1)\\prod... So in the problem statement, the denominator is the nth root of (x_i^n + (n^n -1) times the product of x_j). So in LaTeX, it should be \\sqrt[n]{x_i^n + (n^n -1) \\prod_{j=1}^n x_j}. But in the user's input, there's a typo: the closing parenthesis after 1 is not matched. The original problem as written by the user has:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{x_i}{\\sqrt[n]{x_i^n+(n^n-1)\\prod\\limits _{j=1}^nx_j}} \\ge 1\\,.$$\n\nNotice that after (n^n -1), there's a closing parenthesis but the opening parenthesis is after \\sqrt[n]{. So it should be \\sqrt[n]{x_i^n + (n^n -1) \\prod ... }, with the parenthesis properly enclosing the terms. So in the formatted problem, we need to correct that LaTeX typo. However, the user might have intended that, but as per instructions, the assistant should structure the problem as given, filtering unrelated information. The original question includes the LaTeX as is, so maybe we should present it as the user wrote, even with possible typos. However, given that the user's example corrected the original problem's statement (in the example, the original had \"A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n(3^n +2^n)\" and the formatted problem fixed the parentheses to 5^n +1), so maybe in this case, the assistant should correct the LaTeX if there's an error. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem's inequality:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{x_i}{\\sqrt[n]{x_i^n+(n^n-1)\\prod\\limits _{j=1}^nx_j}} \\ge 1\\,.$$\n\nThe denominator is written as \\sqrt[n]{x_i^n+(n^n-1)\\prod ... }, but the closing parenthesis after (n^n -1) is not matched. The \\sqrt[n]{...} expects the entire expression inside the curly braces. So the correct LaTeX should be \\sqrt[n]{x_i^n + (n^n -1) \\prod_{j=1}^n x_j}. The user has an extra closing parenthesis after (n^n -1), which is incorrect. Therefore, to correct it, the denominator should be \\sqrt[n]{x_i^n + (n^n -1) \\prod_{j=1}^n x_j}. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we should fix this typo.\n\nBut the user's example shows that they corrected the original problem's formatting. For instance, in the example, the original had \"5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night)\" which was formatted as \"5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right)\". So perhaps in this case, the assistant is expected to correct minor LaTeX errors. Therefore, the correct denominator should have the product inside the root without an extra parenthesis. So the problem statement in the formatted version should have:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{x_i}{\\sqrt[n]{x_i^n + (n^n -1) \\prod\\limits_{j=1}^n x_j}} \\ge 1.$$\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have the assumption that each $x_i$ is positive, and the problem statement with corrected LaTeX.",
