    "Content": "Question is to prove : $f : S^1 \\to \\mathbb R$ is continuous then $f(x)=f(-x)$ for some $x\\in S^1$ I guess it would be helpful to use intermediate value theorem Assuming $f(x)\\neq f(-x)$ then given any $p\\in (f(-x),f(x))$ (assuming $f(-x)<f(x)$) there exists $y\\in (-x, x)$ such that $f(y)=p$ I am not very sure of how to use this.. It would be helpful if someone can give some hint which would help me to solve this.. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Define $g:[0,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}$ as $g(t):=f(e^{2\\pi it})-f(-e^{2\\pi it})$. Clearly $g$ is also continuous. \nWe claim that $g$ is zero at some point. \nIf that is true, say $g(t_0)=0$, then it means $f(e^{2\\pi it_0})=f(-e^{2\\pi it_0})$, hence we get what we wanted. Suppose $g(t)\\neq 0\\; \\forall\\; t\\in S^1$, in particular $g(0)\\neq 0$. \nObserve that $g(0)=f(1)-f(-1)$ and $g(\\frac{1}{2})=f(-1)-f(1)=-g(0)$.\nHence if $g(0)>0$, then $g(\\frac{1}{2})<0$, and similarly, if $g(0)<0$, then $g(\\frac{1}{2})>0$. \nThus by the intermediate value theorem, there must be a point say $t_0\\in (0,\\frac{1}{2})$ such that $g(t_0)=0$, which gives a contradiction. Observe that in the same way you can obtain not just a $t_0\\in (0,\\frac{1}{2})$ such that $g(t_0)=0$, but another point $t_1\\in (\\frac{1}{2},1)$ such that $g(t_1)=0$, because $g(1)=g(0)$. Note: Instead of defining $g$, you may define, $h:S^1\\to \\mathbb{R}$, as $h(x)=f(x)-f(-x)$, and follow the same steps as above. The intermediate value theorem can be applied to the function $h$ also, because $S^1$ is a path-connected space.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to format the given problem according to their specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is to prove that for any continuous function f from the circle S¹ to the real numbers R, there exists some point x on S¹ such that f(x) equals f(-x). The user mentioned trying to use the intermediate value theorem (IVT) and considered the case where f(x) ≠ f(-x) for all x, leading to a contradiction.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states that f is a continuous function from S¹ to R. The goal is to show that there's some x where f(x) = f(-x). \n\nThe example provided by the user lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The function f is defined on the domain S¹.\n2. The function f maps to the codomain R.\n3. The function f is continuous.\n\nThese are three separate conditions, each applied to the function f. The problem then is to prove the existence of such an x where f(x) = f(-x).\n\nI need to ensure that the assumptions are listed correctly without combining multiple properties into one line. Let me check again. The problem states f: S¹ → R is continuous. So each part of that definition should be a separate assumption: domain S¹, codomain R, continuity. That's three assumptions.\n\nThe problem statement itself is to show that there's an x in S¹ with f(x) = f(-x). \n\nNow, comparing with the example given, the original problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the function's domain, codomain, and continuity. So structuring them line by line makes sense.\n\nI don't see any other hidden assumptions. The user mentioned using IVT, but that's part of the solution approach, not an assumption of the problem. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions on f, like being differentiable or anything else. So the three assumptions are correct.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function with domain S¹,\nf maps to codomain R,\nf is continuous.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an x ∈ S¹ such that f(x) = f(-x).\n\nI need to present it exactly in that format, using the specified structure. Let me verify once more to ensure no steps are missed and all assumptions are properly listed.",
