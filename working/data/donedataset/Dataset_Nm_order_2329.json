    "Content": "When are two groups which have the same number of elements of each order isomorphic? Can we characterize them? I already know the abelian $\\Bbb Z_{p^2}\\times \\Bbb Z_p$ and non-abelian $\\Bbb Z_{p^2}\\rtimes\\Bbb Z_p$ have the same number of elements of any order, however they are not isomorphic. I mean, can we prove two abelian groups are isomorphic if they have the same orders and spectra? Or can we prove two non-abelian groups are isomorphic if they have the same orders and spectra?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "My interpretation of the question is \"Do there exist non-isomorphic non-abelian groups $G$ and $H$ such that $|G|=|H|$ and they have the same number of elements of the same order\". This is not the classification question, but I suspect this is the question the OP wants to know the answer to (and is asked in the last line). Note that, as leo points out in the comments, the abelian case is covered elsewhere . The solution to the non-abelian case is, perhaps, quite easy. As the OP points out, there exist abelian and non-abelian groups which have the same number of elements of any order, call them $A$ and $B$. So $A$ is abelian, $B$ is non-abelian, $|A|=|B|$ and we have the condition on the order of elements. The idea is simply to take $G=A\\times B$ and $H=B\\times B$. However, cross-produts can introduce elements of new orders (for example, $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_3\\cong\\mathbb{Z}_6$), so we have to be careful. I am not saying that the above construction doesn't always work, but rather you would have to prove that it always works. In order to get round this proof, take $B$ to be the following group.\n$$B=\\langle x,y,z; x^3 = y^3 = z^3 = 1, yz = zyx, xy = yx, xz = zx\\rangle$$\nThis group has order 27, exponent three and is non-abelian. To see this you should check that each of $(yz)^3$, $(y^2z)^3$ and $(yx^2)^3$ define the trivial element. Then take $A=\\mathbb{Z}_3^3$ to be the abelian group of order 27 and exponent three. Taking $G=A\\times B$ and $H=B\\times B$ solve the problem! EDIT You can find non-abelian groups of order $p^n$ and exponent $p$, $p>2$, by considering the subgroup $S_n^p$ of $GL_n(\\mathbb{Z}_p)$ consisting of upper-triangular matrices, so $S_3^p$ consists of matrices of the following form.\n$$\\left(\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n1&\\ast&\\ast\\\\\n0&1&\\ast\\\\\n0&0&1\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$$\nThe $3\\times 3$ matrix groups constructed this way are called Heisenberg groups , and its isomorphism class is that of the extra-special $p$-group of exponent $p$ . This means that you can find lots of non-isomorphic groups with the same orders and spectra.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about groups with the same number of elements of each order and when they are isomorphic. The user mentioned examples of abelian and non-abelian groups with the same order spectra but not isomorphic, and is asking if we can characterize such groups or prove isomorphisms under certain conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem seems to involve two groups. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So, the main objects here are two groups. The key conditions are that they have the same number of elements of each order, and the user is asking about when they are isomorphic. \n\nLooking at the example provided in the original query: the user refers to abelian and non-abelian groups with the same number of elements of each order. So, one assumption is that the groups have the same number of elements for every order. Then, they are asking specifically about abelian groups and non-abelian groups. So another assumption might be whether the groups are abelian or not. However, in the example given, even though the two groups (one abelian, one non-abelian) have the same order spectra, they aren't isomorphic. So the problem is about characterizing when such groups are isomorphic despite having the same order spectra.\n\nThe user's questions are whether two abelian groups with the same orders and spectra are isomorphic, or similarly for non-abelian groups. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Group G is abelian.\n2. Group H is abelian.\n3. Groups G and H have the same order (number of elements).\n4. Groups G and H have the same spectra (number of elements of each order).\n\nAlternatively, for the non-abelian case:\n\n1. Group G is non-abelian.\n2. Group H is non-abelian.\n3. Groups G and H have the same order.\n4. Groups G and H have the same spectra.\n\nBut the original question is more general. It's asking when two groups with the same number of elements of each order are isomorphic. The example shows that even with same order and spectra, they might not be isomorphic. The user wants a characterization.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to characterize when two groups (either both abelian or both non-abelian) with the same number of elements of each order are isomorphic. So the assumptions should capture that two groups have the same order and same spectra, and possibly other conditions.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the abelian and non-abelian groups have the same order (since they are both of order p^3, I think) and same spectra but are not isomorphic. So the user is asking if within the class of abelian groups, having same order and spectra implies isomorphism, and similarly for non-abelian groups. The answer for abelian groups is yes because finite abelian groups are determined up to isomorphism by their order type (fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups). So two finite abelian groups with the same order and same number of elements of each order must be isomorphic. But the user's example contradicts this? Wait, the user says that Z_{p²} × Z_p and Z_{p²} ⋊ Z_p have the same number of elements of each order. But Z_{p²} × Z_p is abelian, while the semidirect product is non-abelian. However, in the abelian case, if two abelian groups have the same order and same spectra, are they isomorphic? Wait, maybe not. For example, take two different decompositions of abelian groups. Wait, the fundamental theorem says that finite abelian groups are direct products of cyclic groups of prime power order, and the decomposition is unique up to the order of factors. Therefore, if two abelian groups have the same order and the same spectra, they must be isomorphic? Wait, but the example given by the user seems to suggest otherwise. Wait, but maybe the example is incorrect. Let me check. Let's take p=2. Then Z_4 × Z_2 has exponent 4, and elements of order 1, 2, and 4. How many elements of each order? The trivial element: 1. Elements of order 2: in Z_4 × Z_2, the elements of order 2 are (0,0), (2,0), (0,1), (2,1). Wait, no. Wait, elements in Z_4 × Z_2 are pairs (a,b) where a is in Z_4 and b in Z_2. The order of (a,b) is lcm(ord(a), ord(b)). So ord(a) can be 1,2,4 and ord(b) 1,2. So possible orders: 1,2,4.\n\nElements of order 1: only (0,0). So 1 element.\n\nElements of order 2: elements where lcm(ord(a), ord(b))=2. So ord(a) and ord(b) must divide 2. So a is 0 or 2 in Z_4, and b is 0 or 1 in Z_2. So possible pairs: (0,0) [order 1], (0,1) [order 2], (2,0) [order 2], (2,1) [order 2]. So elements of order 2: (0,1), (2,0), (2,1). That's 3 elements.\n\nElements of order 4: elements where lcm(ord(a), ord(b))=4. So ord(a) must be 4, and ord(b) can be 1 or 2. So a is 1 or 3 in Z_4, and b is 0 or 1. So pairs (1,0), (1,1), (3,0), (3,1). Each of these has order 4. So 4 elements.\n\nSo total: 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 elements, which is correct since Z_4 × Z_2 has 8 elements.\n\nNow, the non-abelian group Z_4 ⋊ Z_2. Let's see. Wait, actually, the semidirect product depends on the automorphism. For p=2, the group Z_4 ⋊ Z_2 can be the dihedral group D_4, which has 8 elements. Let's check the order of elements in D_4. D_4 has rotations and reflections. Rotations: 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. Elements of order 1: identity. Order 2: 180°. Order 4: 90°, 270°. Reflections: five elements of order 2. Wait, D_4 has 8 elements: 4 rotations (including identity) and 4 reflections. The rotations: identity (order 1), 90° (order 4), 180° (order 2), 270° (order 4). The reflections all have order 2. So elements of order 1: 1. Order 2: 180° and 4 reflections, total 5. Order 4: two elements. So in D_4, the number of elements of each order is different from Z_4 × Z_2. Hence, the example given by the user may not be correct, or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is for an odd prime p. Let's take p=3. Then Z_{9} × Z_3 is abelian of order 27. The non-abelian group Z_9 ⋊ Z_3, where the action is nontrivial. Let's see the orders of elements. In Z_9 × Z_3, elements have orders dividing lcm(9,3)=9. So possible orders 1,3,9.\n\nNumber of elements of order 1: 1.\n\nElements of order 3: all elements (a,b) where (a,b)^3 = (3a, 3b) = (0,0). So 3a ≡0 mod 9 ⇒ a ≡0 mod 3. So a can be 0,3,6 in Z_9. And 3b ≡0 mod 3 ⇒ b can be 0,1,2. So total 3*3=9 elements, but subtract the identity (0,0), so 8 elements of order 3.\n\nElements of order 9: elements where a is not divisible by 3. So a=1,2,4,5,7,8 in Z_9. For each such a, b can be 0,1,2. So 6*3=18 elements of order 9.\n\nTotal elements:1+8+18=27.\n\nIn the non-abelian group Z_9 ⋊ Z_3, let's assume the action is multiplication by a element of order 3 in Aut(Z_9), which is isomorphic to Z_6. So an automorphism of order 3 would be multiplication by 4, since 4^3=64 ≡1 mod 9. So the semidirect product has elements (a,b), where a ∈ Z_9, b ∈ Z_3, with multiplication (a,b)(c,d)=(a + 4^b c, b + d). Let's check the orders of elements.\n\nAn element (a,b) has order equal to the smallest k>0 such that k*(a,b)=(0,0). The operation is additive in the first component with twisted by the automorphism. Wait, actually, in the semidirect product, the multiplication is (a,b)(c,d) = (a + φ_b(c), b + d), where φ_b is the automorphism. Since φ_b is multiplication by 4^b. So each time you multiply (a,b) by itself k times, you get:\n\n(a, b)^k = (a + φ_b(a) + φ_b^2(a) + ... + φ_b^{k-1}(a), kb).\n\nSo for (a,b), to have order k, we need that kb ≡0 mod 3, so k is a multiple of 3/gcd(b,3). Also, the first component must sum to zero.\n\nIf b=0, then φ_b is the identity, so the first component is ka. So the order is lcm(ord(a)/gcd(k, ord(a)), ord(b)). Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's take specific cases.\n\nIf b=0, then elements are (a,0), which have order equal to ord(a) in Z_9. So same as in the direct product.\n\nIf b=1, then to compute the order of (a,1). The order must be a multiple of 3 since b=1, so 3 divides k. Let’s try k=3.\n\nCompute (a,1)^3 = (a + 4a + 16a, 3) = (a(1 +4 +16), 0) = (21a mod 9, 0). 21 ≡ 3 mod 9, so 21a = 3a. So (3a, 0). For this to be (0,0), we need 3a ≡0 mod 9 ⇒ a ≡0 mod 3. So if a ≡0 mod 3, then (a,1) has order 3. If a is not divisible by 3, then (a,1)^3 = (3a, 0) which is not (0,0), so we need to go further. Let's compute k=9.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe it's better to refer to known results. However, the user claims that these groups have the same number of elements of each order but are not isomorphic. If that's the case, then the assumptions would be that two groups (one abelian and one non-abelian) have the same order and same spectra but are not isomorphic. However, the question is about characterizing when two groups with the same spectra are isomorphic. The user asks if two abelian groups with same order and spectra are isomorphic, or two non-abelian groups.\n\nFrom the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, two finite abelian groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same invariant factors (or same elementary divisors). The number of elements of each order is determined by the group structure. However, there might be non-isomorphic abelian groups with the same order and same number of elements of each order? Wait, let's see. For example, consider Z_2 × Z_4 and Z_8. Both have order 8. Z_8 has elements of order 1, 2, 4, 8. But Z_8 has one element of order 1, one of order 2, two of order 4, and four of order 8. Wait, no. Wait, Z_8: elements 0 (order 1), 4 (order 2), 2,6 (order 4), 1,3,5,7 (order 8). So elements: order 1:1, order 2:1, order 4:2, order 8:4.\n\nIn Z_2 × Z_4: elements are pairs (a,b). Order is lcm(ord(a), ord(b)). ord(a) can be 1 or 2, ord(b) 1,2,4. So possible orders: 1,2,4.\n\nOrder 1: (0,0). 1 element.\n\nOrder 2: (0,2), (1,0), (1,2). So 3 elements.\n\nOrder 4: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3). So 4 elements.\n\nSo Z_2 × Z_4 has elements of orders 1,2,4, while Z_8 has elements up to order 8. So their spectra are different. Therefore, in the abelian case, different groups have different spectra. Thus, if two abelian groups have the same order and same spectra, they must be isomorphic. Because their structure is determined by the invariant factors, and the spectra would differ if the invariant factors differ.\n\nTherefore, the user's example might be incorrect or for a specific case where p=3 and the groups are not abelian. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct for certain primes. But assuming that the example holds, the problem is asking whether within abelian or non-abelian groups, same spectra imply isomorphism.\n\nThe user's question is whether two abelian groups with same order and spectra are necessarily isomorphic, and similarly for non-abelian groups. The answer for abelian groups is yes, as per the fundamental theorem. For non-abelian groups, the answer is no, as there are non-isomorphic non-abelian groups with the same order and spectra.\n\nBut the user wants to characterize when they are isomorphic. So the problem is to determine under what conditions two groups (abelian or non-abelian) with the same order and element order spectra are isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: \n- Group G is abelian,\n- Group H is abelian,\n- Groups G and H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nAnd similarly for non-abelian:\n\nAssumption: \n- Group G is non-abelian,\n- Group H is non-abelian,\n- Groups G and H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut the user already knows that for abelian groups, sometimes they are isomorphic, but in their example, they claim that two groups (one abelian, one non-abelian) have the same spectra but are not isomorphic. So maybe the question is more general. The user wants to know if within the class of abelian groups, same spectra implies isomorphism, and similarly for non-abelian groups.\n\nIn the example given, Z_{p²} × Z_p (abelian) and Z_{p²} ⋊ Z_p (non-abelian) have the same number of elements of each order, but are not isomorphic. So the user is asking: for two abelian groups with same order and spectra, are they isomorphic? For non-abelian groups with same order and spectra, are they isomorphic?\n\nBut according to the fundamental theorem, abelian groups are determined by their order and the exponents, so yes. But the user's example might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the example is in the non-abelian case.\n\nTo structure the problem correctly, based on the user's question, the assumptions should be:\n\nFor the abelian case:\n- G and H are abelian groups,\n- G and H have the same number of elements of each order,\n- Prove G and H are isomorphic.\n\nFor the non-abelian case:\n- G and H are non-abelian groups,\n- G and H have the same number of elements of each order,\n- Prove G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut the user already knows that in the abelian case, there are examples where they are isomorphic, but perhaps they are asking for a characterization. However, the user's example claims that two groups (abelian and non-abelian) have same spectra but are not isomorphic. So the actual problem is to determine when two groups (both abelian or both non-abelian) with same order and same number of elements of each order are isomorphic.\n\nBut the user's question is phrased as: \"When are two groups which have the same number of elements of each order isomorphic? Can we characterize them?\" So the problem is to characterize such groups, either within abelian or non-abelian classes.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture this. The assumptions would include that two groups have the same number of elements of each order, and the problem is to characterize when they are isomorphic.\n\nBut according to the example the user provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So in the original example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Group G and group H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nThen the problem is: Characterize when G and H are isomorphic.\n\nAlternatively, if focusing on abelian or non-abelian:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G is abelian,\n- Group H is abelian,\n- G and H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut according to the fundamental theorem, finite abelian groups are determined by their order and the number of elements of each order, so this should be true. But the user's example may be a confusion. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, and the answer is that for finite abelian groups, same order and same spectra imply isomorphism, but for non-abelian, it's not necessarily the case.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should separate the abelian and non-abelian cases. The user's question includes both cases, so perhaps structuring it as two separate problems.\n\nHowever, the user wants the problem structured according to the given format. The original question is:\n\n\"When are two groups which have the same number of elements of each order isomorphic? Can we characterize them? I already know the abelian Z_{p²}×Z_p and non-abelian Z_{p²}⋊Z_p have the same number of elements of any order, however they are not isomorphic. I mean, can we prove two abelian groups are isomorphic if they have the same orders and spectra? Or can we prove two non-abelian groups are isomorphic if they have the same orders and spectra?\"\n\nSo the user is asking two separate questions: one for abelian groups, one for non-abelian. Therefore, we can split into two problems.\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G is abelian,\n- Group H is abelian,\n- G and H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G is non-abelian,\n- Group H is non-abelian,\n- G and H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut the user also mentions \"orders and spectra\", so \"orders\" might refer to the order of the group (same order) and \"spectra\" to the number of elements of each order. Therefore, the assumptions should include that the groups have the same order (same number of elements) and same spectra (same number of elements of each order).\n\nThus, the formatted problems would be:\n\nFirst problem (abelian case):\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G is abelian,\n- Group H is abelian,\n- Groups G and H have the same order,\n- Groups G and H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nSecond problem (non-abelian case):\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G is non-abelian,\n- Group H is non-abelian,\n- Groups G and H have the same order,\n- Groups G and H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut the user's example shows that in the non-abelian case, even with same order and spectra, groups may not be isomorphic. Hence, the answer for the non-abelian case is no, but the user is asking if we can prove they are isomorphic, which would not be possible, but the problem is to characterize when they are.\n\nHowever, the user's original question is asking \"When are two groups which have the same number of elements of each order isomorphic? Can we characterize them?\" So the problem is to characterize such groups. Therefore, the formatted problem would capture the general case, but the user's example shows that it's not always true, so the problem is to find conditions under which they are isomorphic.\n\nBut according to the example structure given, it should list the assumptions and then the problem. The user's original example had assumptions on n and the problem to prove divisibility.\n\nSo translating this question into the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G and group H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Characterize when G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut the user's specific questions are about abelian and non-abelian cases. So maybe two separate formatted problems.\n\nAlternatively, since the user mentions both abelian and non-abelian cases, perhaps two separate problems.\n\nBut the original question is a single question asking for characterization. Given that, perhaps the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G and group H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Characterize when G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Group G has a specified number of elements of each order,\n- Group H has the same number of elements of each order as G.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions were about n. Here, the assumptions are about G and H having the same spectra.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G and group H have the same order,\n- For every positive integer d, the number of elements of order d in G is equal to the number of elements of order d in H.\n\nProblem: Characterize when G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut the user also wants to know specifically for abelian and non-abelian groups. However, according to the problem structure, each assumption should apply to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G is abelian,\n- Group H is abelian,\n- Groups G and H have the same order,\n- For every positive integer d, the number of elements of order d in G is equal to the number in H.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nAnd similarly for non-abelian:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G is non-abelian,\n- Group H is non-abelian,\n- Groups G and H have the same order,\n- For every positive integer d, the number of elements of order d in G is equal to the number in H.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut the user's example claims that in the abelian case, there exists non-isomorphic groups with the same spectra, but according to the fundamental theorem, this should not happen. Therefore, there might be a mistake in the example.\n\nIn any case, based on the user's question, the formatted problem should reflect their query. They mentioned abelian and non-abelian groups having same spectra but not isomorphic, and asking if for abelian groups, same spectra imply isomorphism, and similarly for non-abelian.\n\nThus, the formatted problems are as follows:\n\nFirst:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G is abelian,\n- Group H is abelian,\n- Groups G and H have the same order,\n- Groups G and H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nSecond:\n\nAssumption:\n- Group G is non-abelian,\n- Group H is non-abelian,\n- Groups G and H have the same order,\n- Groups G and H have the same number of elements of each order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G and H are isomorphic.\n\nBut given that the user already provided a counterexample for the non-abelian case (though possibly incorrect), the problem for non-abelian would be to determine if such groups are isomorphic, but the answer is no, so the problem is to characterize when they are.\n\nHowever, the user's instruction is to structure the problem, not to provide the answer. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture their question as-is, listing the assumptions and the problem statement.",
