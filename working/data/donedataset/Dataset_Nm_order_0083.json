    "Content": "Back in grade school, I had a solution involving \"folding the triangle\" into a rectangle half the area, and seeing that all the angles met at a point: However, now that I'm in university, I'm not convinced that this proof is the best one (although it's still my favourite non-rigorous demonstration). Is there a proof in, say, linear algebra, that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees? Or any other Euclidean proofs that I'm not aware of?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "According to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem , if $T$ is your triangle, $\\gamma_i$ its sides and $v_i$ its vertices, $$\\int_T K+\\sum_i\\int_{\\gamma_i}\\kappa + \\sum_i\\alpha_i=2\\pi\\chi(T)$$ with $K$ the Gaussian curvature, $\\kappa$ the geodesic curvature along the sides, $\\alpha_i$ the external angle at the vertex $v_i$ (measured in radians), and $\\chi(T)$ the Euler characteristic of $T$. Since the plane is flat, $K\\equiv 0$;  since the sides of the triangle are geodesics, $\\kappa\\equiv0$; and since $T$ is contractible, $\\chi(T)=1$. Therefore the above formula tells us that $$\\sum_i\\alpha_i=2\\pi.$$ Since the internal angle at the $i$th vertex is $\\pi-\\alpha_i$, this tells us that the sum of the internal angles is $\\pi$, which is what we wanted",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. Let me first understand their example and the requirements.\n\nThe example given takes the original problem about proving a number is divisible by 91 and lists assumptions line by line, each about one property of a single object. Then the problem is restated. The original question here is about proving the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. The user's question mentions a folding method from grade school and asks for a proof using linear algebra or other Euclidean methods.\n\nFirst, I need to extract assumptions. The problem is in Euclidean geometry, so the assumptions would relate to the framework used. Since the question is about triangle angles summing to 180°, the assumptions would include that we're working in Euclidean plane geometry, perhaps the properties of parallel lines, and the triangle itself. The user mentions \"Euclidean proofs,\" so the assumptions should be based on Euclidean axioms. \n\nEach assumption should be a single line, addressing one property. So:\n\n- The problem is set in Euclidean plane geometry.\n- The triangle is a flat, two-dimensional figure.\n- The concept of parallel lines and their properties (like corresponding angles) are accepted.\n- The triangle has three sides and three vertices.\n\nWait, but the original problem doesn't state any specific conditions like the triangle being in a plane or assuming the parallel postulate. But since the answer refers to Euclidean proofs, the key assumption is that we're working under Euclidean geometry, not non-Euclidean. So the main assumption is the Euclidean parallel postulate, which allows the sum of angles to be 180°. But how to phrase that as a single line?\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking for a proof, maybe the assumptions are the basic Euclidean axioms and theorems, like the existence of parallel lines and the properties of angles formed when a transversal crosses them.\n\nBut the original question doesn't specify particular conditions on the triangle itself, like it being a specific type (right-angled, etc.). So the assumptions are more about the geometric framework.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption: \nThe problem is within Euclidean geometry,\nThe triangle is a planar triangle,\nThe properties of parallel lines and transversals apply.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line per property applied to one object. Let me think. The problem is to prove the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. In Euclidean geometry, this relies on the parallel postulate. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nEuclidean parallel postulate holds,\nThe triangle lies in a plane,\nThe triangle has three vertices connected by straight line segments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\n- The geometry is Euclidean (i.e., the parallel postulate is valid).\n- The triangle is a simple, non-degenerate triangle in a plane.\n- The concept of angle measure is consistent with Euclidean space.\n\nBut each line should address one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe triangle exists in a Euclidean plane,\nThe parallel postulate applies,\nThe angles of the triangle are measured in degrees.\n\nWait, but the problem is general, so maybe specific conditions aren't needed. Alternatively, the key assumption is that we're working in Euclidean geometry where the parallel postulate holds, allowing the proof using parallel lines. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe problem is considered in Euclidean geometry,\nA straight line can be drawn parallel to any given line through a point not on the line,\nThe triangle is a non-degenerate planar triangle.\n\nEach of these is a single assumption. Then the problem is restated.\n\nNow, check the example given. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was stated \"for every integer n\". However, the formatted problem includes an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be an error in the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which means n is any integer. However, the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless the example has a mistake. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example, but I need to follow their format. However, in their example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps the user's example is wrong. But regardless, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nSo, returning to the current problem. The original question is about proving that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. The user is asking for a proof, possibly using linear algebra or other Euclidean methods. The assumptions here would be the ones necessary for the Euclidean proof, such as the parallel postulate, the triangle being planar, etc.\n\nSo, structuring the answer:\n\nAssumption: \nThe geometry is Euclidean (i.e., satisfies the parallel postulate),\nThe triangle is a non-degenerate planar triangle,\nAngles are measured in degrees.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.\n\nBut maybe more precise. For example, in Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate allows the construction of a line parallel to one side of the triangle through a vertex. The classic proof involves drawing such a parallel line and using alternate interior angles. So the assumptions needed would include the properties of parallel lines and transversals. But how to break them down into single-line assumptions per object.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe triangle is in a Euclidean plane,\nThrough any point not on a line, there exists exactly one line parallel to the given line,\nThe concept of angle measure is consistent with Euclidean space.\n\nBut perhaps the user's example included assumptions that were not explicitly stated in the original problem but were necessary. For instance, in their example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I have to follow the user's instructions regardless.\n\nSo, for the current problem, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is a planar figure in Euclidean geometry.\n- The properties of parallel lines and transversals apply (e.g., alternate interior angles are equal).\n- The triangle is non-degenerate (angles are well-defined).\n\nEach of these as separate lines. Then the problem is to prove the sum is 180 degrees.\n\nThus:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe triangle is situated in a Euclidean plane,\nThrough a point outside a line, exactly one line can be drawn parallel to the original line,\nThe triangle is non-degenerate with three distinct vertices.\nProblem: \nProve that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.\n###",
