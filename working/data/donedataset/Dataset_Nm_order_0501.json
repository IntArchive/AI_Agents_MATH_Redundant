    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $x=666\\cdot10^n$; it has $n+3$ digits. Consider the interval $(x,(1+1/666)x)=(666\\cdot10^n,667\\cdot10^n)$. Then the prime number theorem says that there is at least one prime in this interval for sufficiently large $x$; such a prime must begin with 666 and is thus satanic. Concretely, use Schoenfeld's 1976 result that says for every $x\\ge2010760$ there is a prime in $(x,(1+1/16597)x)$; we extend this interval to the $1+1/666$ interval above. So there is at least one satanic prime with $n$ digits for $n\\ge7$, and the result is proved.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove that there are infinitely many primes containing the sequence 666 in their decimal digits, without using Dirichlet's theorem. The example given uses Dirichlet on the progression 10000n + 6661, which is straightforward if you have the theorem, but without it, it's trickier.\n\nFirst, I need to recall similar problems. The classic one is proving there are infinitely many primes, which Euclid did by contradiction. Then there's the result about primes ending with a certain digit, but that uses Dirichlet. For primes containing a specific string, maybe we can use some modification of the Euclidean argument or other combinatorial methods.\n\nBut primes with 666 in them... The challenge is to ensure that in their decimal expansion, somewhere there's 666. So, how can we construct such numbers and show infinitely many exist? Maybe construct numbers of the form N = 666 followed by some digits, but primes can't be even or end with 5, so maybe numbers like 6661, 6663, etc., but how to ensure infinitely many?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use some form of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. If we can find a number that's 666 in some block of digits and then adjust the rest to make it prime. But primes are tricky to construct directly.\n\nAnother approach: maybe use the fact that for any k, there's a prime with k digits. But that's not helpful here. Or maybe use the theorem that there are arbitrarily large primes with any given substring, but I think that result might rely on Dirichlet or similar theorems.\n\nWait, maybe a density argument? The set of numbers with 666 in them has natural density positive, so maybe there are infinitely many primes in them. But density arguments usually aren't sufficient for primes because primes themselves have density zero.\n\nAlternatively, consider the paper by Maynard on primes with restricted digits. Wait, no, that's about primes missing certain digits. Maybe not applicable here.\n\nWait, another idea: consider numbers of the form a * 10^k + 666 * 10^m + b, but this seems vague. Alternatively, construct numbers where 666 appears in a specific position, then use modular arithmetic to argue that infinitely many such numbers must be prime.\n\nAlternatively, use the idea from the Green-Tao theorem, but that's about arithmetic progressions, not digit patterns.\n\nWait, perhaps use a covering system or some recursive construction. For example, take a number with 666 in it, then insert digits in a way that allows applying the Euclidean method. For instance, suppose we have a finite set of satanic primes, multiply them together, add or subtract some number to create a new number that must have a new prime factor with 666 in it. But how to ensure the new number has 666 in its digits?\n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe instead, construct a number that is guaranteed to have 666 in it and is coprime to all previous primes. For example, take N = product of known satanic primes, then look at numbers like N + 666... something. But ensuring coprimality and that the number itself contains 666 is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, consider that there are infinitely many primes, and the probability that a random n-digit number has 666 in it is roughly (n-2)*10^{-3}, so as n increases, the number of such primes should grow. But this is heuristic, not a proof.\n\nWait, maybe a result by James Maynard on primes containing certain digits? I recall he has work on primes with missing digits, but maybe also on primes containing certain digits. Let me check... Hmm, not exactly. His work is more about primes in sparse sets, but maybe not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, think about the Erdős's theorem on arithmetic progressions, but again, that's different.\n\nAlternatively, use the concept of digit blocks. Suppose we can create a number of the form A * 10^{k+3} + 666 * 10^k + B, where A and B are chosen such that this number is not divisible by small primes. Then, by some combinatorial argument, show that such numbers must contain primes. But proving that requires showing such numbers aren't all composite, which is hard.\n\nAlternatively, use a sieve method to estimate the number of primes with 666 in their digits. But sieve methods usually give upper or lower bounds, and getting a lower bound that tends to infinity is difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps use the fact that for any given digit pattern, there exists a prime containing it, and then inductively extend this to infinitely many. But even proving existence for one is non-trivial without Dirichlet.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the decimal system is base 10, so maybe use base conversion. But I don't see how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, think of primes as being distributed in such a way that any admissible condition is satisfied infinitely often. But what's an admissible condition here? Containing 666 isn't a congruence condition, so admissibility isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, use the concept of concatenation. For example, take primes and concatenate 666 in between. Like if p is prime, then consider p followed by 666 followed by some digits. But again, ensuring primality is not straightforward.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by Euclid: suppose there are finitely many satanic primes, say p_1, p_2, ..., p_k. Construct a new number N = p_1 p_2 ... p_k * 10^{m} + 6661, where m is chosen such that 666 is in the digits. Then N is congruent to 6661 mod each p_i. If 6661 is not divisible by any p_i, then N is coprime to all p_i, so it has a new prime factor, which must be satanic. But why would that prime factor necessarily contain 666? Because N itself contains 666, but the prime factor could be a smaller number that divides N, which might not contain 666. So this approach doesn't ensure the new prime has 666.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiply by a large power of 10 to shift the 666 into the middle. For example, N = 666 * 10^{k} + M, where M is the product of existing satanic primes. Then N would be congruent to 666 * 10^k mod each p_i. If 10^k is invertible mod p_i, then N ≡ 0 + something not divisible by p_i. But again, the prime factors of N might not contain 666.\n\nHmm, this seems stuck. Maybe another approach: use the fact that numbers with 666 in them can be written in certain forms. For example, any number with 666 in decimal is of the form a * 10^{k+3} + 666 * 10^{m} + b, where a, b are integers, and m <= k. Then, perhaps, using some exponential sum techniques to show that infinitely many such numbers are prime. But I don't know enough analytic number theory to carry this out.\n\nAlternatively, refer to the theorem by Bourgain, which shows that primes contain every possible pattern in their digits, but I think that's for sufficiently long patterns and might not specifically address 666. Also, such theorems might use advanced techniques beyond Dirichlet.\n\nWait, maybe this is an open problem? If the question is asking for a proof without Dirichlet, but the only known proof uses Dirichlet, then it might be that no elementary proof is known. But the user is asking for a solution without Dirichlet, so maybe there is an elementary way.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that 666 is three 6s. Maybe use bases. But in decimal, 666 is fixed. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that numbers containing 666 are not contained in any arithmetic progression, so Dirichlet's theorem can't be directly applied. Wait, but the original user used Dirichlet for 10000n + 6661. But that's only one progression. To get infinitely many, you might need infinitely many progressions, but Dirichlet gives one progression with infinitely many primes. So maybe the user is mistaken? Wait, no, 10000n + 6661 would give numbers ending with 6661, but 6661 is a satanic prime. However, if you use Dirichlet's theorem on this progression (which requires that 10000 and 6661 are coprime, which they are since 6661 is prime and doesn't divide 10000), then there are infinitely many primes in that progression, each ending with 6661, hence containing 666. So that's a valid proof using Dirichlet.\n\nBut without Dirichlet, how else can we show that? Maybe use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to construct a prime congruent to 666... modulo something, but I don't see the path.\n\nAlternatively, use the result that there are infinitely many primes with a given substring by using a sieve to show the number of such primes is infinite. For example, the paper by Harman and others on primes with specific digits. But I don't recall the exact methods.\n\nWait, perhaps use the concept of \"digitally delicate primes\" or something similar, but that's about changing digits.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the set of numbers containing 666 is sufficiently dense that the prime number theorem implies there are infinitely many primes in it. But the prime number theorem says the number of primes up to N is ~ N/log N, and the number of numbers with 666 up to N is roughly N / 1000 (since there's about N/1000 numbers with 666 in a certain position). So the heuristic is that the number of primes with 666 up to N is ~ N/(1000 log N), which goes to infinity. But this is just heuristic, not a proof.\n\nTo turn this into a proof, one would need to show that the primes are \"equidistributed\" among numbers with and without 666. But without a tool like Dirichlet, which handles equidistribution in arithmetic progressions, this is difficult.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe use a theorem by Iwaniec or something similar on primes in quadratic forms, but I don't see the connection.\n\nAlternatively, think of constructing primes of the form 666 followed by any number of digits, but ensuring primality is hard. For example, 666...1, 666...3, etc., but proving infinitely many of those are primes is not trivial.\n\nAlternatively, use the concept of prime-producing polynomials. If we can find a polynomial that generates numbers with 666 in them and is prime infinitely often, but the only known prime-producing polynomials are linear (Dirichlet), so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use a diophantine equation approach. Suppose there are finitely many satanic primes, set up an equation that must have a solution, leading to a contradiction. But I don't see how.\n\nHmm, maybe this problem is still open or requires advanced methods beyond Euclid. Since the user mentioned that using Dirichlet's theorem solves it easily, but they want a solution without it, maybe the answer is that there's no known elementary proof, or that it's an open problem. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a clever way to encode the problem into arithmetic progressions that don't require Dirichlet.\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that 666 is divisible by 2, 3, and 37. But primes can't be even or multiples of 3, except 2 and 3. So primes containing 666 must have 666 in digits but not as the last digit. For example, 6661, 16661, etc. So maybe consider numbers where 666 is somewhere in the middle.\n\nBut how to construct infinitely many such primes? Maybe use a similar approach to Euclid but inserting 666 into the number. For example, take the product of known satanic primes, multiply by 10^k, add 6661, and show that the result is a new satanic prime. But as before, this doesn't guarantee the new number is prime or that its prime factors contain 666.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that for any n, there exists a prime between n and 2n (Bertrand's postulate). So between 10^k and 2*10^k, there's a prime. If we choose k such that 10^k has 666 in it, but this seems not directly useful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that there are infinitely many numbers with 666 in them, and each has a prime factor. But that doesn't help because the prime factors might not contain 666.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of base 10 expansions and remainders. For example, construct a number with 666 in its digits that is congruent to 1 mod 2, 1 mod 5 to avoid small factors, but this is similar to Dirichlet's approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a number congruent to 0 mod small primes and 1 mod larger primes, but I don't see how this ensures 666 in the digits.\n\nWait, here's a different angle: The problem is similar to proving there are infinitely many primes with a specific digit pattern. A known result is that any fixed digit pattern appears in the decimal expansion of infinitely many primes. This might be what the question is referring to. However, the proof of such a result might rely on more advanced theorems than Dirichlet, or it might not. For example, the Maynard's theorem or others in analytic number theory.\n\nBut if the original problem can be solved with Dirichlet by considering numbers ending with 6661, then perhaps the answer is that without Dirichlet, it's an open problem or requires advanced methods. However, the user is on Math Stack Exchange, so maybe there's an elementary approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the numbers containing 666 can be written as 1000n + 666, but these are even if n is such, so adjust to 1000n + 667, etc. But this is back to arithmetic progressions. For example, consider numbers like 1000n + 6661, which are not even, not divisible by 5, and may be primes. Dirichlet's theorem would say there are infinitely many if gcd(1000,6661)=1, which they are since 6661 is prime and not a factor of 1000. But without Dirichlet, can we prove this?\n\nProving that there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression 1000n + k where gcd(1000,k)=1 is exactly what Dirichlet's theorem does, but if we can't use it, maybe for specific k there's an elementary proof. For example, for some progressions like 4n+3, 3n+2, etc., Euclid-style proofs exist. But for 1000n + 6661, it's unclear.\n\nThe key is whether 1000 and 6661 have gcd 1, which they do (since 6661 is prime and 1000 factors into 2^3 * 5^3, which doesn't include 6661). So maybe generalize the Euclid proof for specific progressions. For example, in the case of 4n+3, assume finitely many primes p_1,...,p_k ≡3 mod4, then construct N=4*p_1*...*p_k +3, which is ≡3 mod4, so must have a prime factor ≡3 mod4 not in the list. But for 1000n +6661, suppose we have primes p_1,...,p_k ≡6661 mod1000. Then construct N=1000*(p_1...p_k) +6661. If N is prime, done. If composite, it must have a prime factor ≡1 mod something, but I don't see the contradiction. Because N is ≡6661 mod1000, any prime factor q of N must satisfy q ≡ some divisor of 6661 mod1000. But 6661 is prime, so divisors are 1 and 6661. If q≡1 mod1000, then multiplying primes ≡1 mod1000 gives a product ≡1 mod1000, but N ≡6661 mod1000, so some prime factor must be ≡6661 mod1000. Thus, if all primes ≡6661 mod1000 are in the list p_1,...,p_k, then N is divisible by them, but N ≡6661 mod p_i, which is 0 only if p_i divides 6661. Since 6661 is prime, the only possibility is p_i=6661. So if 6661 is in the list, then N=1000*(...)+6661 is divisible by 6661, but N=6661*(1000*(product of other primes) +1), which is not divisible by 6661 unless 1000*(product)+1 is divisible by 6661. But 1000*(product) ≡ -1 mod6661, which would require that product ≡ -1/1000 mod6661. However, unless 1000 has an inverse modulo6661, which it does since gcd(1000,6661)=1, there exists some integer x such that 1000x ≡1 mod6661. So the product would need to ≡-x mod6661. But unless the product is specifically constructed that way, this doesn't necessarily hold. Thus, the Euclid-style proof might not directly work here because N could be divisible by 6661, but if 6661 is already in the list, then N would be 6661*(... +1), which may or may not be divisible by 6661. This seems complicated.\n\nTherefore, perhaps for certain progressions, Euclid's proof can be adapted, but it's non-trivial and may not work for 1000n +6661. Therefore, without Dirichlet's theorem, proving infinitude of satanic primes might not be possible with current elementary methods. Hence, the answer might be that such a proof is not known or requires Dirichlet's theorem, implying that the problem as stated might not have an elementary solution.\n\nBut the user is asking for a solution without Dirichlet's theorem, so maybe the answer is that it's an open problem or that no elementary proof is known. However, the example given in the formatted problem includes an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the user's example seems to have added an assumption. Maybe the original problem had a typo or missing condition?\n\nWait, looking back at the example: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But 91=7*13. So the original problem's answer likely requires that n is such that 5^n and 6^n have certain properties modulo 7 and 13. But the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, possibly to simplify the problem. So perhaps in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem by filtering out assumptions.\n\nWait, the task is to read the Math SE question, filter unrelated info, and structure it into assumptions and problem. The original question says: \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes with 666 in their decimal representation without Dirichlet's theorem.\" The user mentions they used Dirichlet's theorem for the progression 10000n+6661 and asks for solutions without it.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list assumptions and the problem. The assumptions would be any conditions needed. But the original problem doesn't state any; it's a general proof. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions section is empty or clarifies that the primes must contain 666. But the example had assumptions added, so maybe here we need to specify that the primes are satanic (contain 666) and that we are to prove infinitude without Dirichlet.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are properties or conditions applied to one object. In the example, the user added that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that the assistant might have made an error in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem was different. But regardless, following the user's example, perhaps here the assumptions would be that the primes are satanic (contain 666 in decimal), and the problem is to prove there are infinitely many such primes without using Dirichlet.\n\nBut the example added an assumption not in the original problem. Wait, the original example's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem was edited.\n\nWait, the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That changes the problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but following that, the task is to structure the problem with assumptions. So perhaps the assistant is supposed to extract implicit assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is to prove there are infinitely many satanic primes without Dirichlet. The assumptions would be that a satanic prime has 666 in decimal, and perhaps other conditions? The original question doesn't state any other conditions. So perhaps the assumptions section is minimal.\n\nBut following the example, which added an assumption not present in the original problem, maybe the assistant is supposed to list the key conditions. For the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- A satanic prime is defined as a prime with '666' in its decimal representation.\n- The problem is to prove there are infinitely many such primes.\n- The proof must not use Dirichlet's theorem.\n\nBut the user's example includes assumptions on the object (n is integer, n divisible by 7). In the current problem, the objects are primes with '666' in them. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A prime number is considered satanic if '666' appears in its decimal representation.\n- There are infinitely many such primes.\n- The proof should not rely on Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.\n\nBut the problem is to prove there are infinitely many, so the assumption isn't that there are infinitely many, but the properties of the primes. Wait, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- A satanic prime is a prime number with '666' in its decimal representation.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are infinitely many satanic primes without using Dirichlet's theorem.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions listed were about the variable n. Here, the satanic prime is the object, so the assumption is the definition of satanic prime. However, the user's example included two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. But in the original problem, n was quantified as \"every integer\", so the formatted problem added an extra assumption. This is confusing. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants to follow it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant in the example extracted the necessary conditions for the divisibility by 91. For example, 91=7*13, and the expression might be divisible by 7 when n is divisible by 7, and by 13 always, so to require divisibility by both, the assumption is n divisible by 7. So the formatted problem narrowed the original problem.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is to prove there are infinitely many satanic primes without Dirichlet. The assumptions would be the definition of satanic prime and the restriction to not use Dirichlet. But following the example's structure, which listed assumptions on the objects involved (n is integer, n divisible by 7), perhaps here the assumptions would be:\n\n- A prime number is defined as a number with '666' in its decimal representation.\n- The proof must not use Dirichlet's theorem.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state these as assumptions; they are part of the problem statement. The example seems to have split the problem into assumptions and the problem, extracting conditions from the problem statement.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to list the definition of satanic prime as an assumption and the constraint of not using Dirichlet as part of the problem statement or another assumption. But the example included mathematical conditions, not methodological constraints. Therefore, likely:\n\nAssumption:\n- A satanic prime is a prime number containing the substring '666' in its decimal representation.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are infinitely many satanic primes without using Dirichlet's theorem.\n\nBut the example included assumptions about the variables, not the definitions. So maybe the answer is:\n\nAssumption:\n- Primes are considered satanic if their decimal representation contains '666'.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are infinitely many satanic primes without applying Dirichlet's theorem.\n\nThis follows the structure where the assumption defines the object's property, and the problem states what to prove under certain conditions (without a specific method).",
