    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user provided a Math Stack Exchange question about an integral that supposedly equals a specific expression involving pi and roots. The task is to format it according to the given example. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem. The original problem has an integral from 0 to 1 of a complicated function, and the question is whether it equals a certain value. The user mentions that the equality holds numerically up to 10^4 decimal digits. There's also an equivalent form using the regularized beta function. Additionally, there's a simpler case presented as another integral that's equivalent to another beta function expression.\n\nSo, the main problem is to prove the exactness of the integral equality. The assumptions would include the bounds of integration (0 to 1), the integrand's structure with the square root and fourth roots in the denominator, and possibly the equivalence to the regularized beta function. However, since the example provided in the user's instruction lists assumptions as properties or conditions applied to one object each, I need to parse the problem for such elements.\n\nLooking at the integral, the integrand is 1 divided by [sqrt(1-x) * x^(1/4) * (2 - x*sqrt(3))^(1/4)]. The limits are from 0 to 1. The problem is asking if this integral equals (2*sqrt2)/(3*3^(1/8)) * pi. The equivalence to the regularized beta function is mentioned, but that might be part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. The original problem's assumptions would be the structure of the integrand and the limits of integration. However, since the example's assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, here the assumptions might be the form of the integrand components. Wait, but in the example, they listed the conditions on n. Here, perhaps the integrand's components and the limits. But in the problem, the integral is definite from 0 to 1, so maybe the assumptions are that x is in [0,1], the integrand is as given, and perhaps the parameters in the beta function equivalence. However, the problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions are the given integral expression and the domain of integration. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, maybe the assumptions are the components of the integrand. Let me check.\n\nThe problem is to prove the integral equals that value. So the assumptions are the integrand's structure, the integration limits, and maybe the equivalence to the beta function. But in the example, assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, the variable x is integrated from 0 to 1, so perhaps x is in [0,1]. The integrand has sqrt(1-x), which requires 1-x > 0, so x < 1, but since the upper limit is 1, maybe x approaches 1 from below. However, the integral is from 0 to 1, so perhaps the assumptions are the integral's form and the domain. The problem is whether that integral equals the given expression. The example included the conditions on n. Here, perhaps the main assumption is the form of the integrand and the limits. Let me structure it:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is 1 divided by [sqrt(1-x) * x^(1/4) * (2 - x*sqrt(3))^(1/4)].\n\nBut the problem also mentions an equivalent form involving the regularized beta function. However, since the user's example only included the problem's given conditions (like n being integer and divisible by 7), perhaps the equivalence to the beta function is part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Similarly, the other integral with the sqrt(1-x), sqrt[6]{9-x}, etc., is another part of the problem but presented as a simpler case. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which only lists the necessary assumptions and the problem. So perhaps the main problem here is the first integral, and the equivalent form is part of the problem, while the simpler case might be considered a separate problem. However, the user's original post includes all of them, so maybe the problem statement includes all three equations (1), (2), (3), (4). Wait, the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", and the example had one problem. So perhaps each integral and its equivalent beta function form are part of the problem. But in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the problem is to prove that the integral (1) equals the given expression, which is equivalent to (2). The other integral (3) is presented as an even simpler case, equivalent to (4). But the user's original question is asking whether the equality (1) is exact. So the main problem is to prove (1), and the others are additional parts. However, the user's example only had one problem. But the original post here has multiple parts. So perhaps the problem should be stated as proving that integral (1) equals the given expression, which is equivalent to (2), and also the simpler case (3) equals the given expression, equivalent to (4). But how to structure this? The example only listed one problem. The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. Maybe each conjecture is a separate problem, but the user's original post combines them. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the exactness of the equality in (1), with the other parts as equivalent forms or related simpler cases. The user might want the main problem as (1) and the others as additional parts. But the example given in the instruction has the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", so perhaps here the problem is to prove the integral in (1) equals the given expression. The equivalence to (2) is part of the problem statement. Similarly, the simpler case (3) is another problem, but the user might want to include it. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem\" (singular), so perhaps the main problem is the first integral. The other parts are mentioned but perhaps as additional context. The example included the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", even though the original problem had A(n) defined. So here, the problem should be the main integral equality (1), with the equivalence to (2) being part of the problem statement. The other integrals are additional conjectures but maybe part of the same problem. Alternatively, the user wants all of them included. But since the example was one problem, maybe the answer should list the main problem as (1) and mention the equivalent form (2), and perhaps include the simpler case (3) and (4) as separate problems. However, the user's instruction example didn't split the problem into parts. Let me check the user's example again. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, n is divisible by 7) and the problem statement. The integral problem here has multiple parts. The user's instruction says to \"structure that problem\" as per the example. So maybe each integral and its equivalent beta form are separate problems. But the original question is written as a single post with multiple conjectures. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the equality (1), which is equivalent to (2), and then there's a simpler case (3) equivalent to (4). The user may want all these included. But the example's problem was a single statement. Hmm. The user's instruction says \"filtered the unrelated informations\". The original post has the title, the integral (1), the equivalent form (2), then mentions a simpler case (3) and (4), and a related question. The \"unrelated information\" might be the mention of the related question, but the rest are parts of the problem. However, the example in the user's instruction had a problem with a single equation. So perhaps each integral and its equivalent beta function form are separate problems. But the user may want the main problem to include all parts. Alternatively, the problem is the first integral (1), and the others are additional parts. The example had only one problem, but maybe here it's acceptable to have multiple parts. However, the user's format specifies \"Problem: <The problem>\", so perhaps the problem should be written as a single problem. Given that, maybe the problem is to prove that the integral in (1) equals the given expression, noting that it's equivalent to (2), and also to consider the simpler case (3) equivalent to (4). However, the example's problem was concise. Maybe the problem statement should include the main integral and the equivalence, while the simpler case is additional but part of the same problem. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the two integral equalities (1) and (3), each with their equivalent beta forms. But the user's example only had one problem. Since the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", perhaps each conjecture is a separate problem, but the original post has multiple conjectures. However, the user's example had a single problem. Given that, perhaps the answer should present each integral as a separate problem. But the user's instruction says \"the problem\" (singular). Therefore, maybe the main problem is the first integral (1), and the others are mentioned as part of the context but not the main focus. Alternatively, since the user's example included all the necessary parts in the problem statement, perhaps here the problem is to prove the equality in (1) and its equivalence to (2), and the simpler case (3) and (4). However, the example had a single problem statement. I think the best way is to present the main problem as proving the first integral equality (1), with its equivalent form (2), and then mention the simpler case (3) with (4) as additional parts of the problem. But the user's example didn't include multiple parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the exactness of the equality (1), which is equivalent to (2), and also to prove the simpler case (3) equivalent to (4). But how to structure this. The example had \"Problem: Prove that...\". Here, maybe the problem is to prove both equalities (1) and (3), each equivalent to (2) and (4) respectively. But since the user's example only had one problem, perhaps each integral is a separate problem. However, the user wants the answer in the specified format, which includes \"Problem: <The problem>\". Given that, perhaps the problem should include both (1) and (3) as separate problems. But the example had one problem. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the exactness of the equality in (1), and the other integrals are part of the problem's context. Given the user's instruction to filter unrelated information, perhaps the related question mentioned at the end is unrelated, but the integrals and their beta forms are related. Therefore, the assumptions would be the structure of each integrand and their limits, and the problem would be to prove each equality. But since the user's example had assumptions line by line for each condition, perhaps here the assumptions for each integral are the components of their integrands. \n\nLet me attempt to structure this. For the main problem (1):\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is 1 divided by [sqrt(1 - x) * x^(1/4) * (2 - x*sqrt(3))^(1/4)].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals (2*sqrt(2))/(3*3^(1/8)) * pi, which is equivalent to I(sqrt(3)/2; 1/4, 1/4) = 2/3.\n\nFor the simpler case (3):\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is 1 divided by [sqrt(1 - x) * (9 - x)^(1/6) * x^(1/3)].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals pi/sqrt(3), which is equivalent to I(1/9; 1/6, 1/3) = 1/2.\n\nHowever, the user's example included multiple assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), so here each component of the integrand and the integration limits would be separate assumptions. For the first integral:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Integration is performed over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand contains a factor of 1/sqrt(1 - x).\n- The integrand contains a factor of 1/x^(1/4).\n- The integrand contains a factor of 1/(2 - x*sqrt(3))^(1/4).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals the given expression involving pi and roots.\n\nSimilarly for the simpler case. However, the user's example listed assumptions applied to one object each. In the example, the assumptions were about n. Here, the integrand's components are properties of the function being integrated. But maybe the assumptions are the conditions required for the integral to converge or be defined. For example, x in (0,1) to ensure the denominators are non-zero and real. But perhaps that's too detailed. The user's example didn't list convergence conditions, just the properties of n. So maybe here, the assumptions are the structure of the integrand, each part being a separate assumption. Therefore, for the first problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- The lower limit of integration is 0.\n- The upper limit of integration is 1.\n- The integrand includes a term 1/sqrt(1 - x).\n- The integrand includes a term 1/x^(1/4).\n- The integrand includes a term 1/(2 - x*sqrt(3))^(1/4).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals (2*sqrt2)/(3*3^(1/8)) * pi.\n\nSimilarly for the simpler case. However, the example listed assumptions as single properties per line. Here, each part of the integrand is a separate assumption. Also, the equivalent form using the beta function might be part of the problem statement. So the problem would include both the integral and its equivalence to the beta function equality. \n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should list each component of the integrand and the integration limits as separate assumptions, then state the problem as proving the integral equals the given value, noting the equivalence to the beta function form. The simpler case would be another problem with its own assumptions. However, the user's instruction example had one problem with multiple assumptions. Given that, the answer should list all relevant assumptions for each problem. Since the original post includes two integrals, perhaps they should be formatted as two separate problems. But the user's example only had one. The user might want both to be included in one problem statement. Alternatively, since the original question is one post, the formatted problem includes both. But according to the user's example, each problem is separate. Given the user's instruction to follow the example, I'll structure each integral as a separate problem. However, the user's example only had one problem, so perhaps the answer should focus on the main problem, the first integral, and mention the simpler case as part of the problem. Alternatively, the problem includes both conjectures. But the user's instruction is to filter unrelated information. The original post's title focuses on the first integral, and the simpler case is presented as an additional example. Therefore, perhaps the main problem is the first integral, and the simpler case is an additional part of the problem. But the example structured a single problem. Given the complexity, I'll proceed to format the main integral (1) and its equivalence (2) as the primary problem, and the simpler case (3) and (4) as a separate problem. But according to the user's format, it's one problem. Therefore, perhaps the problem includes both integrals as separate parts. However, the user's example had a single problem. This is a bit ambiguous, but I think the intended approach is to present each integral as a separate problem. However, the user's instruction might require a single problem. Let me check the original example again. The original example had the problem to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the original question is about the first integral, and the other integrals are additional conjectures. The user's instruction says \"structure that problem\", referring to the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The problem in the post is to prove the equality of the first integral, and the other integrals are additional parts. Therefore, the formatted problem should include all the conjectures as part of the same problem. However, the example had one problem. Alternatively, since the user's example only included one problem, perhaps the answer should focus on the main integral (1) and mention the others as additional but not part of the formatted problem. The user might want the main problem to be the first integral. Therefore, the answer should list the assumptions for the first integral and state the problem as proving it equals the given value. The other integrals can be considered as additional problems but not included here. \n\nFinal decision: Focus on the first integral (1) and its equivalence (2) as the main problem. The assumptions are the integration limits and each component of the integrand. The problem is to prove the integral equals the given expression, noting the equivalence to the beta function. The simpler case (3) and (4) are additional problems but not part of the formatted output here. The related question is unrelated information and should be filtered.",
