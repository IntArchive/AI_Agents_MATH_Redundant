    "Content": "Here is the text from Knuth's The Art of computer programming, 1.2.6 F formula 14: Knuth doesn't give the proof of the statement. So, I tried to write it myself. To make binomial formula equal to $0^0$, it must satisfy the following conditions: $\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{aligned}\nx = -y\\\\\nr = 0\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\right.\n$ By definition: $\n{n\\choose k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n$ If $k < 0$ or $k > n$, the coefficient is equal to 0 (provided that n is a nonnegative integer) - 1.2.6 B. and if $r = 0$, we have: $\n{0\\choose k}\n$ which is non-zero only when k = 0: $\n{0\\choose 0} = \\frac{0!}{0!(0-0)!} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n$ So, putting our conditions into the formula, we get: $\n(x + (-x))^0 = {0\\choose 0} x^0(-x)^0 = 1\\cdot1\\cdot1 = 1\n$ Therefore, $0^0 = 1$ Is my proof correct? Also this page: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Power.html says, that $0^0$ itself is undefined, although defining $0^0=1$ allows some formulas to be expressed simply (Knuth 1992; Knuth 1997, p. 57). But he is not defining it to be equal to 1, he is deducing this fact from binomial theorem. Plus Knuth doesn't say on page 57 (which is provided), what formulas can be expressed simply. Is the statement about Knuth on mathworld not fully correct?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think you do not interpret the text as it was intended. What Knuth is saying is that the binomial formula as stated cannot be valid unless one defines $0^0=1$. He says so more clearly in his 1992 article Two notes on notation (page 6, equation (1.18)): Anybody who wants the binomial theorem $$(x + y)^n =\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom nk x^ky^{n−k}$$ to hold for at least one nonnegative integer $n$ must believe that $0^0 = 1$, for we can plug in $x = 0$ and $y = 1$ to get $1$ on the left and $0^0$ on the right. Indeed one has for instance $1=(0+1)^2=\\binom20.0^0.1^2+\\binom21.0^1.1^1+\\binom22.0^2.1^0$, and the right hand side reduces to $0^0$ because the last two terms vanish because of the non-controversial evaluations $0^1=0^2=0$. So in particular, this does not just involve the case of the binomial theorem for exponent$~0$; the point is that exponents$~0$ occur on the in the right hand side for every instance of the binomial formula. Note that one usually does not encounter this case explicitly because of our habit of contracting the term $\\binom n0x^0y^n$ to $y^n$ whenever we write explicit instances of the binomial formula. Your citation illustrates this, as Knuth writes terms $x^4$ and $y^4$ in his explicit instance of the binomial formula for $r=4$. (It also illustrates another common peculiarity: in explicit instances of the binomial formula we tend to take the summation index decreasing from $n$ to $0$, or what amounts to the same use a variant of the formula in which the exponents of $x$ and $y$ are interchanged.) Indeed, the most important reason we are not confronted with instances of $0^0$ (and therefore with the need to have it well defined) all the time is, that we have learned the habit, similar to that of suppressing explicit terms$~0$ in a summation or factors$~1$ in a product, of immediately replacing any expression $x^0$ by$~1$ (or simply omitting it if occurring in a product). I consider this a nice paradox of human psychology: The fact that people can maintain that $0^0$ should be left undefined depends on the circumstance that instances of the expression almost never occur when doing mathematics. This state of affairs is a consequence of the habit of systematically suppressing multiplicative factors of the form$~x^0$ when writing formulas. This notwithstanding the fact that the equation $x^0=1$ implicitly applied during this suppression can only be justified if $x^0$ is always defined, in particular for $x=0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the user is asking two things: first, whether their proof of 0^0 = 1 using the binomial theorem is correct, and second, whether the statement on MathWorld about Knuth is accurate.\n\nStarting with the first part. The user's proof goes like this: they consider the binomial formula (x + y)^r. They set up conditions where x = -y and r = 0. Then they substitute into the binomial theorem, which expands to a sum over k of (r choose k) x^{r - k} y^k. Since r is 0, the sum reduces to just k=0 term. Then using the definition of binomial coefficients, (0 choose 0) is 1, and x^0 * (-x)^0 is 1*1. So (x + (-x))^0 = 1, which is 0^0, hence 0^0 = 1.\n\nWait, but hold on. The binomial theorem states that (x + y)^r = sum_{k=0}^r (r choose k) x^{r - k} y^k. However, this is typically stated for non-negative integer exponents r. If r is 0, then it's (x + y)^0, which is 1 for all x + y ≠ 0? But the user is plugging in x = -y, so x + y = 0, and then (0)^0. But normally, 0^0 is indeterminate. So the user is arguing that via the binomial theorem, even in this case, it must be 1.\n\nBut the problem here is whether the binomial theorem applies when x + y = 0 and r = 0. The binomial theorem for integer exponents is generally valid for all x and y, but when r = 0, (x + y)^0 is 1, regardless of x and y, except when x + y = 0, where it might be considered undefined. However, the binomial expansion in that case would still be sum_{k=0}^0 (0 choose k) x^{-k} y^k = (0 choose 0) x^0 y^0 = 1*1*1 = 1. So even if x + y = 0, the expansion gives 1, implying that 0^0 should be 1 for the binomial theorem to hold in this case.\n\nBut the user's assumption here is that the binomial theorem requires 0^0 to be 1 for consistency when applying it to (x + y)^0 where x = -y. The user then concludes that 0^0 = 1. However, the MathWorld page says 0^0 is undefined, though defining it as 1 is useful for certain formulas. Knuth is cited as deducing it from the binomial theorem, but the user is questioning if MathWorld's statement is fully correct since Knuth might not be defining it but rather deriving it.\n\nSo, the user's proof might be correct under the context of assuming the binomial theorem holds for r = 0 and x + y = 0, thereby necessitating 0^0 = 1. But traditionally, 0^0 is considered indeterminate in analysis because the limit of x^y as x and y approach 0 can vary. However, in combinatorics and discrete mathematics, it's often defined as 1 for convenience, such as in the case of empty products or binomial coefficients.\n\nRegarding the MathWorld statement: It says Knuth defines 0^0 = 1 to simplify formulas, but the user argues that Knuth deduces it from the binomial theorem. The user checked Knuth's page 57 and didn't find such a statement. So maybe MathWorld's attribution is slightly off, or perhaps Knuth does make that deduction elsewhere. The user is pointing out a potential discrepancy.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the required format. The original question has two parts: the correctness of the proof and the accuracy of the MathWorld statement about Knuth. But the user's main problem seems to be the proof part. The assumptions would involve the conditions under which the binomial theorem is applied here.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The binomial theorem applies for exponent 0 when x = -y.\n- For the binomial coefficient (0 choose k), it is 1 when k = 0 and 0 otherwise.\n- The expression (x + y)^0 evaluates to 1 even when x + y = 0.\n- 0^0 is defined as 1 in the context of the binomial theorem.\n\nProblem:\nProve that under the conditions x = -y and r = 0, the binomial formula implies 0^0 = 1.\n\nWait, but the original problem is the user's own proof and whether it's correct, as well as the MathWorld statement. But the format example shows that the problem should be restructured to list assumptions and the problem. However, the user is asking two questions: is my proof correct, and is MathWorld's statement about Knuth accurate.\n\nBut according to the example given, the assistant is supposed to structure the problem as Assumptions and Problem. The original problem is about verifying the proof of 0^0 = 1 via binomial theorem and the accuracy of a reference.\n\nBut perhaps the problem here is the user's proof. So the assumptions would be the conditions set by the user (x = -y, r = 0, binomial coefficients definitions) and the problem is to verify if the binomial theorem necessitates 0^0 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as structured is: under the given conditions (x = -y, r=0), does the binomial theorem imply 0^0 =1? And the assumptions would be those conditions and the definitions of binomial coefficients.\n\nSo, putting it into the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- The binomial theorem $(x + y)^r = \\sum_{k=0}^r \\binom{r}{k} x^{r - k} y^k$ holds for $r = 0$.\n- $x = -y$.\n- $r = 0$.\n- $\\binom{0}{k} = 1$ if $k = 0$, and $\\binom{0}{k} = 0$ otherwise.\n- $x^0 = 1$ and $y^0 = 1$ even when $x = 0$ or $y = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nUsing the binomial theorem, prove that $0^0 = 1$ under the specified conditions.\n\nBut the user's actual problem is to verify if their proof is correct and to check the accuracy of the MathWorld statement. However, the example given in the problem only includes the mathematical part, not the reference part. So perhaps the second part about MathWorld is considered \"unrelated information\" and should be filtered out. The task says to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem. The example only included the mathematical problem, so maybe the second part about MathWorld is extraneous.\n\nTherefore, the main problem is the user's proof. So structuring that:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The binomial theorem applies for $r = 0$ even when $x + y = 0$.\n- $\\binom{n}{k} = 0$ if $k < 0$ or $k > n$ where $n$ is a nonnegative integer.\n- $\\binom{0}{0} = 1$.\n- $x^0 = 1$ and $y^0 = 1$ for all $x, y$, including $0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $0^0 = 1$ using the binomial theorem with $x = -y$ and $r = 0$.\n\nBut the user's proof uses these conditions to substitute into the binomial formula and arrives at $0^0 =1$. So the structured problem would list those assumptions and ask to prove $0^0 =1 under those conditions.\n\nAs for the MathWorld part, perhaps it's considered a separate question, but the original instruction says to filter unrelated info. Since the example didn't include discussion about references, maybe that part is omitted. Alternatively, if it's considered part of the problem, then it's more of a verification of a citation, which might not fit into the math problem structure. Hence, focusing on the mathematical proof part.",
