    "Content": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Show that any group of order $4n + 2$ has a subgroup of index 2. (Hint: Use left regular representation and Cauchy's Theorem to get an odd permutation.) I can easily observe that $\\vert G \\vert = 2(2n + 1)$ so $2 \\mid \\vert G \\vert$ and 2 is prime. We have satisfied the hypothesis of Cauchy's Theorem so we can say $G$ contains an element of order 2. This is where I am stuck I am confused about how the left regular representation relates to the group. So my understanding at this point is that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of some symmetric group. My question: is the left regular representation $\\varphi : G \\to S_G$ an isomorphism? where $G \\cong S_G$ or is $S_G$ the same thing as $S_{\\vert G \\vert}$ and $\\varphi$ is only an injection? I'm using Dummit and Foote for definitions. I saw an argument online that said that since we have an element of order 2, there is a $\\sigma \\in S_G$ of order 2, but it is a product of $2n + 1$ disjoint 2-cycles. I don't understand how they could claim this and tried working it out on my own but didn't get there. -- They then went on to use the parity mapping $\\varepsilon : S_G \\to \\{\\pm1\\}$ and since we have an odd permutation $\\sigma$, we have $[S_G:\\text{ker }\\varepsilon] = 2$. I understood their computation but not how that directly shows that $G$ has a subgroup of order 2? unless $G \\cong S_G$ because of how left regular representation is defined. (but again, I'm not understanding that concept very well yet.) So, to be clear about my questions: What is meant by left regular representation, is it an isomorphism or just an injection? and how would it be used here. If it is an isomorphism, the argument online starts to make more sense, but how can they say that since $\\sigma$ is even, it is made up of $2n + 1$ disjoint transpositions? If you have a full, proof, I'd appreciate it, but good hints are just as good! Thanks you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $G=\\{g_1,\\ldots,g_{4n+2}\\}$ . For any $g\\in G$ , define $\\sigma_g\\in S_{|G|}$ as the permutation for which $\\sigma_g(g_i) = g\\cdot g_i$ . Step1. The set of elements $g\\in G$ such that $\\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_g)=+1$ is a subgroup of $G$ , say $H$ . Step2. The only possibilities for $|H|$ are $|H|=|G|$ or $|H|=|G|/2$ , since the \"sign\" is a homomorphism. Step3. By Cauchy's theorem there is a $g\\in G$ with order $2$ (that is $g=g^{-1}$ , so $\\sigma_{g}=\\sigma_{g}^{-1}$ ). Since $g\\neq id$ , $\\sigma_g$ has no fixed points, but $\\sigma_g$ has order $2$ in $S_{|G|}$ , so it is a product of $(2n+1)$ disjoint transpositions. It follows that $\\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_g)=-1$ and we cannot have $|H|=|G|$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants to show that any group of order 4n + 2 has a subgroup of index 2. They mentioned using the left regular representation and Cauchy's Theorem to get an odd permutation. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that G is a group with order 4n + 2, where n is a positive integer. So the main assumptions here are about the order of the group and the structure that comes with it. From Cauchy's Theorem, since 2 divides |G|, there's an element of order 2. That's another assumption.\n\nThe user is confused about the left regular representation. They're asking whether it's an isomorphism or just an injection. From what I recall, the left regular representation maps G into the symmetric group on G (i.e., S_G) via left multiplication, which is an injective homomorphism (Cayley's theorem), but not necessarily an isomorphism unless G is trivial. So S_G here is the symmetric group on the set G, which has order |G|!, so unless G is trivial, it's not isomorphic. But when people talk about symmetric groups in this context, they often use S_{|G|} which is the symmetric group on |G| elements. So maybe the left regular representation is an injective homomorphism into S_{|G|}, which is what the user is confused about.\n\nThe user then mentions an online argument where an element of order 2 in G corresponds to a permutation σ in S_G that is a product of 2n + 1 disjoint transpositions. That would make σ an odd permutation since each transposition is a 2-cycle, and the product of an odd number of transpositions is odd. Then, using the parity homomorphism ε: S_G → {±1}, the kernel of ε is the alternating group, which has index 2. If G has an element mapping to an odd permutation, then the image of G under the left regular representation isn't contained entirely in ker ε, so the intersection of G (via the representation) with ker ε would be a subgroup of index 2 in G. That's the standard approach for showing a group has a subgroup of index 2 by finding an odd permutation in its image under a homomorphism.\n\nBut the user is confused about how the element of order 2 leads to a product of 2n+1 transpositions. Let me think. If you have an element g of order 2 in G, then under the left regular representation, φ(g) is the permutation of G induced by left multiplication by g. Since g has order 2, left multiplication by g twice brings you back to the identity. So each element of G is either fixed or part of a 2-cycle. But since left multiplication by g is a permutation with no fixed points (because if g·h = h, then g = e, which contradicts g having order 2), so every element is part of a 2-cycle. Thus, the permutation φ(g) is a product of |G|/2 disjoint transpositions. Wait, |G| is 4n+2, so |G|/2 is 2n+1. Therefore, φ(g) is a product of 2n+1 disjoint transpositions, which is an odd permutation since 2n+1 is odd. Hence, ε(φ(g)) = -1. Therefore, the image of G under φ is not contained in ker ε, so the subgroup φ^{-1}(ker ε) has index 2 in G. Therefore, G has a subgroup of index 2.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are the order of the group, the existence of an element of order 2 (from Cauchy), the properties of the left regular representation as an injective homomorphism into S_G (which is S_{|G|}), and the structure of the permutation induced by the element of order 2 as a product of 2n+1 transpositions. The problem is to show the existence of a subgroup of index 2, which follows from the parity argument.\n\nSo structuring the problem according to the required format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a group.\n- The order of G is 4n + 2, where n is a positive integer.\n- 2 is a prime divisor of the order of G.\n- G contains an element of order 2 (from Cauchy's Theorem).\n- The left regular representation φ: G → S_G is an injective homomorphism.\n- The permutation φ(g) (for g of order 2) decomposes into 2n + 1 disjoint transpositions.\n- The parity homomorphism ε: S_G → {±1} has kernel of index 2 in S_G.\n\nProblem: Show that any group of order 4n + 2 has a subgroup of index 2.\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't mention all those assumptions explicitly. The user is trying to structure the problem by filtering out unrelated info. The original problem says \"Let n be a positive integer. Show that any group of order 4n + 2 has a subgroup of index 2.\" So the key assumptions are:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a group.\n- The order of G is 4n + 2, where n is a positive integer.\n- (Implicitly, by Cauchy's Theorem) G has an element of order 2.\n\nBut the user also refers to the left regular representation and the permutation being a product of transpositions. However, in the format example provided, the assumptions were more about the problem's given conditions. So the problem's given conditions are:\n\n- G is a group of order 4n + 2 (n positive integer).\n- Need to show G has a subgroup of index 2.\n\nBut the user's confusion is about the left regular representation, which is part of the hint. However, according to the example, assumptions should list the problem's conditions. The example's assumption included the divisibility by 7, which was actually part of the original problem's setup but wasn't explicitly stated (the original problem didn't mention n divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, they added it as an assumption). Wait, no—the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted version, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem requires that n satisfies divisibility by both 7 and 13? But the original problem didn't have that assumption. So maybe the example was incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, the assumptions should be extracted from the problem, not added. But in their example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That's confusing. \n\nWait, maybe the example is a bad example. Let me check the user's instruction again. They said:\n\nExample:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That seems incorrect. Unless the original problem had a typo and was supposed to have that n is divisible by 7. So maybe there's a mistake in the example. But regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem given in the Math Stack Exchange question into the Assumption and Problem sections, filtering out unrelated info.\n\nThe Math Stack Exchange question's main problem is: Let n be a positive integer. Show that any group of order 4n + 2 has a subgroup of index 2. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- G is a group.\n- The order of G is 4n + 2.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the user mentions Cauchy's Theorem giving an element of order 2. However, that's part of the proof steps, not the problem's assumptions. So the problem's assumptions are just the given conditions: G has order 4n + 2, n positive integer. The rest (Cauchy's Theorem, left regular representation) are part of the hint or solution approach, not the problem's explicit assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group.\n- The order of G is 4n + 2.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that G has a subgroup of index 2.\n\nBut in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might have been an error. Therefore, to stay true to the original problem, we should list only the given conditions as assumptions.\n\nHowever, the user might want assumptions to include all necessary conditions needed to state the problem, even if they are derived from the problem's statement. For instance, in the group problem, since the order is 4n + 2, and n is positive, then |G| is even, so 2 divides the order, hence by Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element of order 2. But is that an assumption or a consequence? The problem doesn't state \"Assume G has an element of order 2\", it's a consequence of the group's order. So in the formatted problem, assumptions should be only the given conditions, not derived properties. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group.\n- The order of G is 4n + 2, where n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that G has a subgroup of index 2.\n\nBut the original problem's user mentions the hint about left regular representation and Cauchy's theorem, but the formatted problem example includes assumptions that might be part of the solution. However, the example given by the user seems to have added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That might be a mistake, but following the user's example, perhaps they expect to include some derived assumptions. However, that's conflicting. To resolve this, perhaps the assumptions are only the explicit conditions given in the problem statement, not any derived ones. So for the group problem:\n\nOriginal problem: Let n be a positive integer. Show that any group of order 4n + 2 has a subgroup of index 2.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- G is a group.\n- The order of G is 4n + 2.\n\nProblem:\nShow that G has a subgroup of index 2.\n\nBut in the example, they added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. That seems incorrect. So perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, the example might have been from a different problem where divisibility by 7 was necessary. Maybe the original problem had a mistake. Anyway, following the user's instruction to structure the problem as per their example, but in this case, the original problem does not have additional assumptions beyond the group's order and n being positive. Therefore, sticking to the problem as stated:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group.\n- The order of G is 4n + 2.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that G has a subgroup of index 2.\n\nBut in the example, the user split assumptions into one per line, each addressing one property of one object. So in the group problem, each line would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nThe order of G is 4n + 2,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that G has a subgroup of index 2.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The assumptions are G is a group, its order is 4n + 2, and n is positive. Each is a separate condition.",
