    "Content": "So I'm just learning about the compact-open topology and am trying to show that for a compact, Hausdorff space ,$X$, the group of homeomorphisms of $X$, $H(X)$, is a topological group with the compact open topology.  This topology has a subbasis of sets $\\{f\\in H(X):f(C)\\subseteq V\\}=S(C,V)$ for compact $C$, open $V$.  This is my first attempt at getting to know this topology, so I'd appreciate some help with the part of a proof I have so far, possibly a better way to go about proving this, and any other help understanding this topology. First, let $c:H(X)\\times H(X)\\rightarrow H(X)$ be composition.  For $f,g\\in H(X)$, let $S(C,V)$ be a subbasis set with $f\\circ g\\in S(C,V)$.  So $f(g(C)\\subseteq V$ which means $f\\in S(g(C),V)$ and $g\\in S(C,f^{-1}(V)$.  The product of these open sets works since if $h_1(C)\\subseteq f^{-1}(V)$ and $h_2(g(C))\\subseteq V$, then $h_2\\circ h_1(C)\\subseteq V$. Then let $i:H(X)\\rightarrow H(X)$ be inversion.  Take a subbasis set $O=\\{g:g(C)\\subseteq U\\}$ and consider $i^{-1}(O)=\\{g^{-1}:g(C)\\subseteq U\\}$.  If $h^{-1}\\in i^{-1}(O)$, then one thing we have is that $h(C)\\subset U$, but I'm not totally sure what to do with this.  This part seems like it should be easier, but I am just not seeing it. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here you don't need much topology, it boils down to pure manipulation of sets and bijective functions , and the two following facts: $(*)$ closed subsets of compact spaces are compact, and $(**)$ compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed. Just take complements and use the fact that $h$ is by definition a bijection, so\n$$\\begin{array}{RCL}\nh\\in S(C,U) & \\Longleftrightarrow & h(C)\\subset U\\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow & X\\setminus U\\subset \\underbrace{X\\setminus h(C)}_{=h(X\\setminus C)}\\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow & h^{-1}(X\\setminus U)\\subset X\\setminus C \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow &  h^{-1}\\in S(X\\setminus U,X\\setminus C)\n\\end{array}$$\n(which is a subbasic open neighborhood) i.e. \n$$\\mathrm{inv}^{-1}( S(C,U))=\\mathrm{inv}(S(C,U))=S(X\\setminus U,X\\setminus C)$$\nwhich proves the inversion map $\\mathrm{inv}$ to be continuous.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that the homeomorphism group H(X) of a compact Hausdorff space X is a topological group under the compact-open topology. They mentioned using the subbasis sets S(C,V) where C is compact and V is open. \n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states that X is compact and Hausdorff. Then, H(X) is the group of homeomorphisms of X. The compact-open topology on H(X) has a subbasis consisting of sets S(C,V) = {f in H(X) | f(C) ⊆ V}. The user is trying to verify that composition and inversion are continuous, which are the requirements for a topological group.\n\nLooking at the example given earlier, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption 1: X is a compact space.\nAssumption 2: X is a Hausdorff space.\nAssumption 3: H(X) is the group of homeomorphisms of X.\nAssumption 4: The topology on H(X) is the compact-open topology, with subbasis sets S(C,V) = {f ∈ H(X) | f(C) ⊆ V} where C is compact in X and V is open in X.\n\nThe problem is to prove that H(X) with this topology forms a topological group, meaning that the composition map c: H(X) × H(X) → H(X) and the inversion map i: H(X) → H(X) are continuous.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"form a topological group\", which requires that both the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous. The user's attempt is dealing with composition and inversion. So the problem is exactly that: show that H(X) is a topological group under the compact-open topology, i.e., that composition and inversion are continuous maps.\n\nSo the formatted assumptions would list each property of X (compact, Hausdorff), the structure of H(X) as homeomorphisms, and the topology being compact-open with the given subbasis. The problem is to prove H(X) is a topological group.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single condition per line. Let me check again.\n\nAssumption 1: X is a compact space.\nAssumption 2: X is a Hausdorff space.\nAssumption 3: H(X) is the group of all homeomorphisms of X.\nAssumption 4: The topology on H(X) is the compact-open topology.\nAssumption 5: The compact-open topology has a subbasis consisting of sets S(C, V) = {f ∈ H(X) | f(C) ⊆ V} where C is a compact subset of X and V is an open subset of X.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were concise. Let me see. The example had two assumptions for n: being integer and divisible by 7. Here, for X, two assumptions (compact and Hausdorff), then H(X) is the homeomorphism group, and the topology is compact-open with the subbasis. Maybe split into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\nX is compact,\nX is Hausdorff,\nH(X) is the group of homeomorphisms of X,\nH(X) is endowed with the compact-open topology,\nThe compact-open topology on H(X) has subbasis sets S(C, V) = {f ∈ H(X) | f(C) ⊆ V} for each compact subset C of X and each open subset V of X.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention X being Hausdorff in the title, but in the question it says \"for a compact, Hausdorff space X\". So the user does state X is compact and Hausdorff. So all those are given.\n\nProblem is: Prove that H(X) is a topological group under the compact-open topology.\n\nTherefore, the formatted version should list each condition on X and H(X), then the problem statement.",
