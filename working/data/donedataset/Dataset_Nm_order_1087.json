    "Content": "Clearly the kernel of a group homomorphism is normal ( proof ), but I often hear my professor mention that any normal subgroup is the kernel of some homomorphism. This feels correct but isn't entirely obvious to me. One thought I had is that for any normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ , we could define the quotient homomorphism $\\pi:G\\to G/N$ since $G/N$ is a group. I was imagining that we could consider $\\pi^{-1}:G/N\\to G$ , whose kernel would then be $N$ . However, $\\pi^{-1}$ doesn't exist since $\\pi$ is not a bijection in general. So my question is this: is there an obvious way to define a homomorphism whose kernel is an arbitrary normal subgroup of $G$ ? Or does it depend on the particular group whether you can define such a homomorphism?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You only have to consider that $\\pi:G\\to G/N$, defined by $\\pi(x)=xN$, is a homomorphism and the $\\ker \\pi$ is precisely $N$.",

Specifically, $\\ker(\\pi) = \\{g \\in G \\mid \\pi(g) = e_{G/N}\\} = \\{g \\in G \\mid gN = N\\} = N$. Thus, every normal subgroup $N$ is the kernel of the homomorphism $\\pi$.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking whether every normal subgroup N of a group G is the kernel of some homomorphism. They mentioned that they know kernels are normal, but the converse isn't as clear. They thought about the quotient map π: G → G/N, which makes sense because G/N is a group when N is normal. But then they considered π inverse, which doesn't exist unless π is bijective, which it's not unless N is trivial. So they're stuck there.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the fundamental theorem of homomorphisms. If there's a homomorphism φ: G → H, then the kernel of φ is a normal subgroup of G, and conversely, if N is normal in G, then the canonical projection π: G → G/N is a homomorphism with kernel N. Wait, that seems like exactly what the user was initially thinking. But they confused themselves by trying to take the inverse of π, which isn't necessary.\n\nSo the key here is that the quotient homomorphism π itself already has kernel N. The user's mistake was thinking they needed an inverse of π, but actually, π is the homomorphism they're looking for. The kernel of π is exactly N because π(g) = gN, and the kernel is the set of elements g where gN = N, which is just N itself.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that for any normal subgroup N of G, the natural projection homomorphism π: G → G/N has kernel N. So there's no need to construct a different homomorphism; the quotient map itself suffices. The user might have overlooked that π is the required homomorphism, thinking instead they needed an inverse map. So the problem is resolved by recognizing that π's kernel is N, hence N is the kernel of π.\n\nBut wait, the user also asked if there's an obvious way to define such a homomorphism. The answer is yes, by using the quotient group and the canonical projection. It doesn't depend on the particular group; this construction works universally for any normal subgroup because the quotient group is well-defined when N is normal.\n\nSo summarizing, the assumptions are that N is a normal subgroup of G, and the problem is to show that there exists a homomorphism whose kernel is N. The solution is the natural projection π: G → G/N, which is a homomorphism with kernel N.",
