    "Content": "Let $0 < x_1 < 1$ and $x_{n + 1} = x_n - x_n^{n + 1}$ for $n \\geqslant 1$. Prove that the limit exists and find the limit in terms of $x_1$. I have proved the existence but cannot manage the other part. Thanks for any help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can clearly write each term $x_{n}$ as a polynomial in $x=x_1$, and it should be apparent that all such polynomials are $x + O(x^2)$.  Then the difference $x_{n+1}-x_{n}=x_{n}^{n+1}$ is $O(x^{n+1})$, and so the coefficient of $x^{k}$ is the same for all $x_{n}$ with $n\\ge k$.  This allows us to determine the power series expansion of $x_\\infty=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}x_{n}$: it is\n$$\nx_\\infty(x) = x-x^2-x^3+2x^4+3x^6-20x^7+30x^8-11x^9-31x^{10}+228x^{11}+\\dots\n$$\nThe OEIS doesn't have anything matching this particular sequence.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. The original question is about a sequence defined by a recurrence relation. The user wants to prove that the limit exists and find that limit in terms of the initial term x₁. They've already shown existence but need help finding the explicit limit.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n- The title mentions \"Limit of (xₙ) with 0 < x₁ < 1\". So the first assumption is about x₁ being between 0 and 1.\n- The recurrence relation is x_{n+1} = xₙ - xₙ^{n+1} for n ≥ 1. So that's another assumption about the sequence's definition.\n- The problem asks to prove the limit exists (which the user says they've done) and find the limit in terms of x₁. So the problem part is to find the limit given those assumptions.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem had an assumption like \"n is divisible by 7\" but here, the original problem doesn't mention any such divisibility. Wait, maybe I need to check if there are any hidden assumptions. The problem states 0 < x₁ < 1 and the recurrence. Are there other conditions? The user hasn't mentioned any more. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. x₁ is a real number such that 0 < x₁ < 1.\n2. For each integer n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} = xₙ - xₙ^{n+1}.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that example seems like the user might have modified it. Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like maybe the user made a mistake? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, perhaps that's an error in the example. But maybe the example was intended to show how to filter unrelated information. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the user mistakenly included the divisibility by 7, but the correct assumption is n is any integer.\n\nBut maybe the example is an incorrect example. But regardless, in the current problem, I need to list all the assumptions given in the original problem, not adding new ones. So the original problem here says:\n\n- 0 < x₁ < 1\n- x_{n+1} = xₙ - xₙ^{n+1} for n ≥ 1.\n\nSo those are the two assumptions. Each on a separate line.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the limit exists (which the user has done) and find the limit in terms of x₁.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list those assumptions and then state the problem part. Let me check the example again to ensure the structure is correct.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions are:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem was for every integer n, so the formatted problem seems to have added an extra condition. That might be a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had some hidden condition. Hmm, but maybe that's a typo. Anyway, perhaps in the example, the user intended to show that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", there might be an unstated assumption, but in our current problem, the assumptions are clearly given.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumption: 0 < x₁ < 1,\n\nAssumption: For each integer n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} = xₙ - xₙ^{n+1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of the sequence (xₙ) exists and find the limit in terms of x₁.\n\nBut wait, the user says they have already proved existence, so the problem part is to find the limit in terms of x₁. However, the original problem statement still includes both parts. So should we include both in the problem statement? The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. The example includes the problem as stated, even if part is already done. So maybe the problem part should remain as the original, even if the user has solved part of it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem part is only what remains to be solved. The user says \"Prove that the limit exists and find the limit in terms of x₁. I have proved the existence but cannot manage the other part.\" So maybe the problem part should be \"find the limit in terms of x₁\" given the assumptions. But the original problem as stated includes both parts. So perhaps the formatted problem should keep both, but the user is focusing on the second part.\n\nHowever, according to the user's instruction, we need to structure the problem as in the example, which may include the entire original problem statement, even if part is already solved. For example, in their example, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91, which might have required both parts (div by 7 and 13), but the formatted problem lists an assumption. But perhaps in the example, the user intended to highlight that n is divisible by 7 is an assumption, but that's not present in the original problem. Maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, we need to follow the user's structure.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- 0 < x₁ < 1\n\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} = xₙ - xₙ^{n+1}\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit exists and find the limit in terms of x₁.\n\nBut since the user mentions they have already proved existence, but the original problem still states both parts. So perhaps we should keep both in the problem statement. The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which includes the entire problem statement. So I think we should keep both parts in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \n0 < x₁ < 1,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} = xₙ - xₙ^{n+1}.\n\nProblem: \nProve that the limit of the sequence (xₙ) exists and find the limit in terms of x₁.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"Limit of (xₙ) with 0 < x₁ <1 and x_{n + 1} = xₙ - xₙ^{n + 1}\" and the question says \"Prove that the limit exists and find the limit in terms of x₁\".\n\nSo the problem is exactly as stated. Therefore, the formatted problem should include both parts. So even if the user has done existence, the problem as per the original post includes both. Hence, the formatted problem should have both parts.",
