    "Content": "I am trying to use $f(x)=x^3$ as a counterexample to the following statement. If $f(x)$ is strictly increasing over $[a,b]$ then for any $x\\in (a,b), f'(x)>0$ . But how can I show that $f(x)=x^3$ is strictly increasing?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider $a^3-b^3$, where $a\\gt b$. We want to show this is positive .\nWe have \n$$a^3-b^3=(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2).$$\nNote that $a^2+ab+b^2$ is positive unless $a=b=0$. There are many ways to do this. For example,\n$$a^2+ab+b^2=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(a^2+b^2+(a+b)^2\\right).$$\nMore conventionally, complete the square. We have $4(a^2+ab+b^2)=(2a+b)^2+3b^2$. Remark: If we are in a calculus mood, note that \n$$\\frac{a^3-b^3}{a-b} =3c^2$$\nfor some $c$ between $a$ and $b$. This argument breaks down if $c=0$. But that can only happen when $0$ is in the interval $(b,a)$. That means $b$ is negative and $a$ is positive, making the inequality $a^3\\gt b^3$ obvious.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can read a Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and present it in the specified format.\n\nFirst, let's look at the example provided. The original problem was about proving that a certain expression is divisible by 91. The formatted version lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then states the problem. Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention that n has to be divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example had some additional context or maybe the assumptions were inferred. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the example was from a different problem? Wait, maybe I need to check again. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted assumption includes n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. If it's for every integer n, why is there an assumption that n is divisible by 7? Maybe the example is incorrect, but I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, moving on to the current problem. The problem given is from Math Stack Exchange titled \"How to prove x^3 is strictly increasing\". The question is about using f(x)=x³ as a counterexample to the statement that if f is strictly increasing on [a,b], then for any x in (a,b), f’(x) >0. The user wants to show that f(x)=x³ is strictly increasing.\n\nSo the task is to structure this problem into the Assumption and Problem sections. The example shows that assumptions list properties or conditions applied to one object each.\n\nLooking at the problem: The user is trying to show that x³ is strictly increasing. The function in question is f(x)=x³. The problem is to prove that f is strictly increasing, but the context is using it as a counterexample because even though it's strictly increasing, its derivative at x=0 is zero. So the assumptions here would be about the function's properties. Let me think.\n\nThe original problem doesn't mention any specific interval, but the user's statement refers to an interval [a,b]. Wait, the user's question says: \"If f(x) is strictly increasing over [a,b] then for any x in (a,b), f’(x) >0\". So the user is considering the general statement, and wants to use f(x)=x³ as a counterexample. The counterexample would work because f is strictly increasing on, say, [-1,1], but f’(0)=0. Therefore, to show that f is strictly increasing on some interval that includes 0, which would contradict the original statement.\n\nBut the specific task here is to format the problem into Assumptions and Problem. So what are the assumptions here? The function is f(x)=x³. The problem is to prove it's strictly increasing. Wait, but perhaps the original problem has more context. Wait, the user is trying to use it as a counterexample, so maybe the assumptions include that f is strictly increasing on [a,b], but there exists a point where the derivative is zero. However, in the formatted problem, we need to state the assumptions that are given in the problem.\n\nWait, the user's problem is: How to show that f(x)=x³ is strictly increasing. The original problem's context is to use it as a counterexample. The question is about proving that x³ is strictly increasing. The assumptions for this problem would be the properties of the function. Since the problem is just to show x³ is strictly increasing, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = x³ is defined for all real numbers (since the function is being considered over an interval, which might be all real numbers unless specified otherwise).\n\nBut maybe the key assumption here is that the function is differentiable, but that's part of the problem's context. Alternatively, since the user mentions using the derivative in the original statement, maybe the assumption is that f is differentiable, but in the problem statement, the user is trying to show that even though the derivative at 0 is zero, the function is still strictly increasing.\n\nWait, the actual problem here is to prove that x³ is strictly increasing. The assumptions would be the properties of the function and any given conditions. For proving that x³ is strictly increasing, the standard approach is to show that if a < b, then a³ < b³. Alternatively, using the derivative, which is 3x², which is non-negative everywhere and positive except at x=0. However, strictly increasing is defined by the function preserving the order: if x < y then f(x) < f(y). The derivative being non-negative and positive except at a point is sufficient for strictly increasing in the case of functions like x³.\n\nBut in the problem's context, the user wants to show that f(x)=x³ is strictly increasing (to serve as a counterexample where the derivative is zero at a point but the function is still strictly increasing). So the assumptions for this problem would be:\n\n- f(x) = x³ is a real-valued function.\n- The domain of f is the set of real numbers (or perhaps an interval containing 0, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe just assuming f is defined on the real line).\n- The problem is to prove that f is strictly increasing on its entire domain.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is more general. Let me check the exact question again:\n\nThe user's question: \"How can I show that f(x)=x³ is strictly increasing?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that x³ is strictly increasing. The assumptions would be the definition of f and perhaps the domain. Since the user mentions using it as a counterexample over an interval [a,b], maybe the interval is not specified here, so the assumption is that the domain is the real numbers, or some interval. But the problem as stated doesn't specify an interval, so perhaps the default is all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = x³ is defined for all real numbers x.\n- We are considering the function f over the entire set of real numbers.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumption is that f is differentiable, but that's not necessary for proving it's strictly increasing. One can prove it using the definition without derivatives. Alternatively, using derivatives, but since the derivative at 0 is zero, that complicates things.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So in this case:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f(x) = x³,\n- The domain of f is the set of real numbers,\n- The function f is considered over interval [a, b] (but the original problem doesn't specify, so maybe not),\nWait, the original question mentions the interval [a,b] in the statement they are trying to counterexample. But the user's specific problem is to show that x³ is strictly increasing. So perhaps the assumption is that we are considering the function on the real line, unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe no specific interval is given, so the problem is to show that x³ is strictly increasing in general. So the assumptions would just be the definition of f(x)=x³, and that x is a real number.\n\nBut according to the example, the user might list each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f(x) = x³,\n- x is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = x³ is strictly increasing.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each line is a separate condition. In this problem, the function is defined as x³, and x is real. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is defined by f(x) = x³ for all real numbers x.\n\nBut maybe more precisely:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f: ℝ → ℝ is defined by f(x) = x³,\n- The problem considers strict monotonicity of f over its entire domain.\n\nBut the example used simpler terms. The key is to list each assumption separately. Since the problem is to prove that x³ is strictly increasing, the main assumptions are:\n\n1. The function in question is f(x) = x³.\n2. The domain of f is all real numbers (since the problem doesn't specify an interval).\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as x^3,\nx is a real number.\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) = x^3 is strictly increasing.\n\nWait, but the original question mentions using it over [a,b] as a counterexample. However, in the problem statement given by the user, the specific task is to show that f(x)=x³ is strictly increasing. Therefore, the assumptions are just about the function and its domain. The interval [a,b] is part of the broader context (the statement they are trying to counterexample), but the specific problem to format is just proving x³ is strictly increasing.\n\nSo yes, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = x³,\n- x is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = x³ is strictly increasing.\n\nAlternatively, since the derivative is mentioned in the context, perhaps the assumption includes differentiability, but I think the problem is general, not necessarily requiring calculus. So the answer should be structured accordingly.",
