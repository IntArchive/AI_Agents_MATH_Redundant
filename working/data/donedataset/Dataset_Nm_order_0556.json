    "Content": "Many results are based on the fact of the Moment Generating Function (MGF) Uniqueness Theorem, that says: If $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables and equality holds for their MGF's: $m_X(t) = m_Y(t)$ then $X$ and $Y$ have the same probability distribution: $F_X(x) = F_Y(y)$. The proof of this theorem is never shown in textbooks, and I cannot seem to find it online or in any book I have access to. Can someone show me the proof or tell me where to look it up? Thanks for your time.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then state the problem.\n\nLooking at the original problem in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the problem statement, the original problem mentions \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted version adds that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the original example had a different problem? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Hmm, that seems like a mistake. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" then the assumption shouldn't add that n is divisible by 7. Unless maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Or maybe the problem was different. Wait, perhaps the example is correct, and I need to follow that structure, even if there's a discrepancy. But maybe the example is illustrative of how to separate assumptions, even if the original problem had some conditions.\n\nBut moving on to the current problem. The question is about proving the Moment Generating Function Uniqueness Theorem. The user is asking for the proof, which isn't usually shown in textbooks, and they can't find it online. The task is to structure this into the Assumption and Problem format.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The theorem states that if two random variables X and Y have the same MGF (m_X(t) = m_Y(t)), then their probability distributions are the same. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. X and Y are random variables.\n2. The moment generating functions m_X(t) and m_Y(t) exist for X and Y, respectively.\n3. The equality m_X(t) = m_Y(t) holds for all t in some neighborhood around 0.\n\nWait, but the problem statement as given by the user says \"equality holds for their MGF's: m_X(t) = m_Y(t)\". But MGFs need to exist in a neighborhood around 0 for the uniqueness theorem to hold. So maybe the existence of MGFs is an assumption here. Because if the MGFs don't exist, the theorem doesn't apply.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- X and Y are random variables.\n- The moment generating functions m_X(t) and m_Y(t) exist for X and Y in a neighborhood around 0.\n- m_X(t) = m_Y(t) for all t in that neighborhood.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applying to one object each. Then the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, X and Y have the same probability distribution.\n\nSo the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then state the problem as proving the distributions are the same.\n\nLet me check if there are any other assumptions. For example, sometimes the uniqueness theorem requires that the MGF exists in a neighborhood of zero, which is necessary for the proof involving analytic continuation or Laplace transforms. So that's an important assumption. The user's original question mentions the theorem but doesn't specify the conditions under which it holds. So in structuring the problem, we need to include those conditions as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should cover that X and Y are random variables, their MGFs exist in a neighborhood of 0, and they are equal there. Then the problem is to prove the distributions are the same.\n\nI think that's all. Let me put this into the required format.",
