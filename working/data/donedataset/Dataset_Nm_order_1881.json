    "Content": "We will call a matrix positive matrix if all elements in the matrix are positive, and we will denote the largest eigenvalue with $\\lambda_{\\max}$ , what is exist because of the Perron–Frobenius theorem . Theorem. Let $A$ be a positive square matrix. If any element increases in the matrix then $\\lambda_{\\max}$ increases. My questions. Is there a name for this theorem and can anybody say books or papers what refer to it? How to prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(Following Surb’s suggestion, the result in this answer is now strengthened.) This is just a simple consequence of Perron-Frobenius theorem. We can prove something slightly more general: Proposition. [remark] Let $A,B$ be two nonnegative square matrices. If $A\\le B$ entrywise, $A\\ne B$ and $B$ is irreducible, then $\\rho(A)<\\rho(B)$ . Proof. Since $B$ is irreducible, $\\rho(B)>0$ . Let $(\\rho(A),v)$ be a left Perron eigenpair of $A$ . Observe that $v^T(B-A)\\ne0$ . This is obvious when $v$ is a positive vector. When $v$ has zero entries, $A$ must be reducible. So, by a permutation we may assume that $v^T=(v_1^T,0)$ for some positive vector $v_1$ of, say, length $m$ . Since $v^T$ is a left eigenvector of $A$ , $A$ must be block lower triangular when partitioned conformingly. Now, if $v^T(B-A)=(v_1^T,0)(B-A)=0$ , the first $m$ rows of $B-A$ must be zero. But then $B-A$ and $B=(B-A)+A$ will be block lower triangular. This is impossible, as $B$ is irreducible. Therefore $v^T(B-A)\\ne0$ . It follows that $v^T(B-A)$ is a nonnegative but nonzero vector.  Now let $(\\rho(B),w)$ be a right Perron eigenpair of the $B$ . Since $B$ is irreducible, $w$ is positive. Therefore $$\n\\big(\\rho(B)-\\rho(A)\\big)v^Tw = v^T(B-A)w >0\n$$ and $\\rho(B)>\\rho(A)$ . [Remark] The result above is stated without proof as corollary 1.5 on p.27 of Nonnegative Matrices in the Mathematical Sciences by Berman and Plemmons. Unlike in our formulation of the result, what the authors assume to be irreducible in the book is not $B$ , but $A+B$ . This is really strange, because when $0\\le A\\le B$ , $B$ is irreducible if and only if $A+B$ is irreducible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the question from Math Stack Exchange according to the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question: It's about a theorem regarding positive matrices. The user mentions that a positive matrix has all elements positive, and they denote the largest eigenvalue as λ_max, which exists due to Perron-Frobenius theorem. The theorem states that if any element of the matrix increases, then λ_max increases. The questions are about the name of the theorem, references, and how to prove it.\n\nNow, following the example provided earlier, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem.\n\nAssumptions here are: A is a positive square matrix (all elements positive). Then, another assumption is that an element in the matrix increases. The problem is to prove that λ_max increases. Wait, but in the original problem, the user is asking for the theorem's name, references, and proof. However, in the example given, the problem was restated as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps in this case, the problem part should be the request to prove the theorem, but the user also asks for the name and references. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example only included the problem statement (the proof part), not the other questions. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem listed assumptions and the problem as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the other questions (name, references) are considered part of the problem. But the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". So maybe include all the questions as part of the problem statement.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" with Assumption and Problem. The example included the problem as the mathematical statement to prove, even though the original question had \"Prove that...\".\n\nSo in this case, the problem is the theorem statement, and the user's questions (name, references, proof) are part of the original question but need to be structured into the problem part. Wait, the example didn't include the \"Prove that...\" in the original problem's other parts. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7 (but wait, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7; perhaps the user made a mistake there. Wait, no, maybe in the example, the original problem had a mistake or maybe there was a different context. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example was a typo. Maybe the original problem was supposed to have n divisible by 7? Because in the formatted problem, they added that assumption. So maybe the example is illustrative, not an actual correct problem.\n\nBut regardless, the structure is to list assumptions and the problem. So in the current case, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. A is a positive square matrix (all elements positive).\n2. Any element of A increases.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the theorem that if any element increases, then λ_max increases. So the assumptions are that A is a positive square matrix, and then when an element increases, leading to the conclusion about λ_max.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should be applied to one object. So first, A is a positive square matrix. Then, another assumption is that an element of A increases. But the problem is to prove that λ_max increases. However, the user's original question also asks for the name of the theorem and references. How to incorporate that into the problem statement?\n\nThe problem part in the format is just the problem. In the example, it was \"Prove that ... is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is the theorem statement, and the user is asking about its name, references, and proof. So perhaps the problem part should encapsulate all the user's questions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is the theorem statement, and the user's questions are separate. But according to the example, the problem was restated as the mathematical statement to prove, even though the original question was \"Prove that...\".\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a positive square matrix (all elements are positive).\n- An element of A increases.\n\nProblem:\n- Prove that the largest eigenvalue λ_max increases under the element increase.\n- Provide the name of this theorem.\n- Give references (books or papers) that refer to it.\n\nBut the original format example only included the mathematical problem. However, the user's question here includes three parts: name, references, and proof. So how to handle that? The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which includes \"Problem: <The problem>\". So perhaps the problem should include all three questions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is the theorem statement, and the other parts are separate questions. But the example included only the mathematical statement as the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main problem is the theorem statement, and the other questions (name, references) are auxiliary. But the user's original question includes all three parts. Therefore, to be faithful to the original problem, the problem part should include all three questions. However, in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that...\", so maybe the other questions (name, references) are considered part of the problem's context but not the main problem to solve. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". The example shows that in the original problem, the user had to prove something, and the formatted problem lists assumptions and the problem as the statement to prove, even if the original problem had other elements.\n\nBut in this case, the original problem is asking for the theorem's name, references, and proof. So perhaps the main problem is the theorem statement, and the other parts are the user's requests. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the theorem as the problem, and the user's questions (name, references, proof) are part of the problem. But according to the example, the problem part is just the mathematical statement to prove. So maybe the problem is the theorem, and the user's questions are part of the original post but not part of the formatted problem. However, the user instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which in that case, the problem was the mathematical statement. So perhaps here, the problem is the theorem statement, and the user's questions about name, references, and proof are additional but need to be incorporated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem part should encapsulate all the user's questions. For example, \"State and prove the theorem that if any element of a positive square matrix increases, then its largest eigenvalue increases. Provide the theorem's name and references.\" But I need to follow the example's structure, which in the example had only the mathematical problem. So maybe the problem is to prove the theorem, and the name and references are additional parts. But the format only has \"Problem: <The problem>\".\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Looking back at the example, the original problem was \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the other parts (name, references) are considered part of the problem statement here. So the problem would be: \"What is the name of the theorem stating that if any element of a positive square matrix increases, then its largest eigenvalue increases? Provide references and a proof.\"\n\nBut the example's problem part was a direct statement to prove. Since the user's question has three parts, maybe the problem should be written as three questions. However, the format only allows one problem statement. Perhaps combining them into one problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the main problem is the theorem, and the name and references are auxiliary. So the problem is to prove the theorem, and the other parts are additional questions. But the format requires the problem to be structured as one statement. Given the example, it's likely that the problem part is the theorem statement, and the user's other questions (name, references) are part of the original post but not part of the structured problem. Therefore, the formatted problem would be the theorem to prove, with assumptions.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a positive square matrix (all elements are positive).\n- An element of A increases.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the largest eigenvalue λ_max of A increases.\n\nBut the user also asks for the name and references. Should they be included in the problem? According to the example, the problem was restated as the mathematical statement to prove, even though the original question was \"Prove that...\". So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that if any element of a positive square matrix increases, then its largest eigenvalue increases. Additionally, provide the theorem's name and references.\"\n\nBut the example's problem part was just the mathematical statement. The user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which includes assumptions and problem. The example's problem part was the mathematical statement. So perhaps here, the problem is the theorem statement to prove, and the other questions (name, references) are considered part of the original post but not the problem itself. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a positive square matrix (all elements positive).\n- An element of A increases.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the largest eigenvalue λ_max of A increases.\n\nBut the original problem also asks for the name and references. However, in the example, the formatted problem only included the mathematical problem. So perhaps the user wants to extract the core mathematical problem (the theorem to prove) and list the assumptions, while the other parts (name, references) are considered part of the original question but not part of the structured problem. Therefore, the formatted problem would focus on the proof part, with assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem part should include all the questions. For example:\n\nProblem:\nWhat is the name of the theorem stating that increasing any element of a positive square matrix increases its largest eigenvalue? Provide references and a proof.\n\nBut this combines multiple questions into one problem statement. The example had the problem as a single mathematical statement. I think the intended approach is to extract the mathematical problem (the theorem to prove) and structure it with assumptions, while the other parts (name, references) are part of the original post but not the structured problem. Therefore, the formatted problem would be the theorem to prove.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a positive square matrix.\n- All elements of A are positive.\n- An element of A increases.\n\nWait, but \"positive matrix\" is defined as all elements being positive. So the first assumption is that A is a positive square matrix (which implies all elements are positive). Then, the second assumption is that an element of A increases. But according to the format, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a positive square matrix (i.e., all elements of A are positive).\n- An element of A is increased.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the largest eigenvalue λ_max of A increases.\n\nBut the user also asks for the name and references. However, in the example, those weren't included in the formatted problem. So perhaps the structured problem only includes the proof part, and the name and references are additional questions not captured in the format. But the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which includes assumptions and problem. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a positive square matrix,\nAn element of A increases.\nproblem:\nProve that the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}$ of A increases.\n\nBut the user's original problem includes asking for the theorem's name and references. However, the example only included the mathematical problem in the formatted version. Therefore, perhaps the other parts are considered part of the original question but not part of the structured problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should focus on the mathematical statement to prove, with assumptions.\n\nBut to be precise, the original problem's main questions are threefold: name, references, proof. However, the format example only included the mathematical problem. So perhaps the structured problem here should include the mathematical problem to prove, with assumptions, and the other questions are considered separate but part of the original post.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem part should include all three. But given the example, it's safer to model it after the example. Hence, the answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a positive square matrix,\nAll elements of A are positive,\nAn element of A increases.\nproblem:\nProve that the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}$ of A increases.\n\nWait, but \"positive matrix\" already means all elements are positive, so maybe redundant to list both. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps even if some conditions are implied, they are listed separately. But in this case, \"positive square matrix\" is defined as all elements positive, so maybe the assumption is:\n\n- A is a positive square matrix (i.e., all elements are positive).\n- An element of A increases.\n\nThen the problem is to prove λ_max increases. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a positive square matrix,\nAn element of A increases.\nproblem:\nProve that the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}$ of A increases.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions that λ_max exists due to Perron-Frobenius. Should that be an assumption? Probably not, since it's a consequence of the matrix being positive. The existence of λ_max is part of the Perron-Frobenius theorem, which is given in the problem statement, but perhaps not an assumption. So the assumptions are about the matrix and the increase, not about the existence of λ_max.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be as above.",
