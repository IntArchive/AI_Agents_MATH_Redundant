    "Content": "I am reading Kelley’s book on general topology. There are a few statements on nets there (chapter 2), but the characterization of compact sets in the language of nets is not given. How should we prove the following Theorem: A topological space X is compact iff every net has a convergent subnet.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that $x_\\alpha$ is a net in $X$ with no convergent subnet. Then $(x_\\alpha)$ do not have accumulation point in $X$. For each $x\\in X$, let $V_x$ be an open neighbourhood of $x$ that excludes all the part of the net from some term onward. Let $V=\\{V_x:\\ x\\in X\\}$ and note that $V$ is an open cover of $X$. Can you prove that it is impossible to find a finite subcover of $X$ in $V$? On the other hand, let $V$ be a open cover of $X$ such that every finite subcover of $V$ do not cover $X$. Consider the open cover $U$ of $X$ consisting of finite unions of elements of $V$. If $A,B\\in U$, we say that $A\\leq B$ when $A\\subseteq B$. With this relation, $V$ is an directed set. For $A\\in V$, let $x_A\\in X\\setminus A$. Can you show that the net $x_A$ does not have any convergent subnet?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let's start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Nets and compactness in topological spaces.\" The question mentions Kelley’s book on general topology, stating that while there are some discussions on nets in chapter 2, the characterization of compact spaces using nets isn't provided. The user wants to know how to prove the theorem: A topological space X is compact if and only if every net has a convergent subnet.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about topological spaces, compactness, and nets. The theorem has two directions: compact implies every net has a convergent subnet, and conversely, if every net has a convergent subnet, then the space is compact. \n\nAssumptions here would be the properties that the space X is a topological space. Also, the problem is about equivalence, so both directions need to be considered. But in the example provided, the assumption listed was about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So in this case, the main objects are the topological space X and the nets in it. \n\nWait, the problem is a theorem statement. So the assumptions for each direction would be different. But according to the example, the assumption part lists the conditions given in the problem. For the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the user clarified that actually, the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7, but the answer's example had that. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, looking at the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. However, in the original problem, the user didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that example was incorrect? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. The answer's example incorrectly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be a mistake. But the user provided that as their example. So perhaps the instructions are that the assumption part should list all the given conditions in the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated? Wait, no. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, the answer added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be a mistake. But maybe the user intended to structure the problem with necessary assumptions, perhaps filtering out unrelated information.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was modified. Let me check again. The original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem under assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem actually requires n to satisfy some divisibility? But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the example given by the user is wrong. But regardless, the task is to follow the user's format as per their example, even if it's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the task is to structure the theorem into assumptions and problem. The theorem states that a topological space X is compact iff every net has a convergent subnet. The assumptions here would be that X is a topological space. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables involved. So in this case, the main assumption is that X is a topological space. But the problem is to prove the equivalence, so maybe each direction has different assumptions. Wait, but in the problem statement, the theorem is stated as a general equivalence. So the problem is for any topological space X, it is compact if and only if every net in X has a convergent subnet. Therefore, the assumption is that X is a topological space. However, in the example provided, the user listed assumptions about the variables in the problem (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about X being a topological space. But maybe the assumption part in this case should list that X is a topological space. But is that an assumption? The problem is to prove the equivalence for any topological space. Wait, but in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" because the problem states \"for every integer n\". Similarly, here, the theorem is about a topological space X, so the assumption is that X is a topological space. But the problem is to prove the equivalence. Therefore, the assumption is that X is a topological space, and the problem is to prove that X is compact if and only if every net in X has a convergent subnet. But maybe the original problem is to prove this theorem, so the assumption would just be that X is a topological space. However, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption. Similarly, here, the theorem is for any topological space X, so the assumption is that X is a topological space.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem statement. Let's look again at the example. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption is n is an integer. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information? Maybe the original problem had some other conditions that were filtered. Wait, the user's instruction says \"filtered the unrelated information\". So maybe in the original problem, there were some irrelevant parts, and the formatted problem lists only the relevant assumptions. In the example, maybe the original problem had n being an integer and something else, but the answer focused on n being an integer and divisible by 7. But the example given by the user is their own structured version. So perhaps the task is to read the problem, filter any unrelated information, and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is about proving that a topological space X is compact iff every net has a convergent subnet. The original question mentions that the user is reading Kelley’s book, which may not be relevant. The key parts are the theorem statement. So the assumptions would be that X is a topological space. The problem is to prove the equivalence. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: X is a topological space.\n\nProblem: Prove that X is compact if and only if every net in X has a convergent subnet.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption listed specific conditions on n. Here, the main condition is that X is a topological space. So that's the only assumption needed. The problem is to prove the equivalence. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption as X being a topological space, and the problem as proving the equivalence.\n\nBut maybe the user wants each assumption on a separate line. However, in this case, there's only one assumption: X is a topological space. Therefore, the formatted problem would have that assumption and then the problem statement.",
