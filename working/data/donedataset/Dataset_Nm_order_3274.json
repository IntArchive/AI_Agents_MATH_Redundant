    "Content": "What is the fundamental group of a wedge sum in general? e.g. including the times when van Kampen cannot help us. The Wikipedia article on wedge sums mentions that Van Kampen's theorem gives certain conditions (which are usually fulfilled for well-behaved spaces, such as CW complexes) under which the fundamental group of the wedge sum of two spaces $X$ and $Y$ is the free product of the fundamental groups of $X$ and $Y$. This seems strangely worded. The conditions on the space for van Kampen are that it is the union of path-connected open sets $A_\\alpha$, each contains the basepoint, each intersection $A_\\alpha\\cap A_\\beta$ is path-connected, each intersection $A_\\alpha\\cap A_\\beta\\cap A_\\gamma$ is path-connected; then it follows that the the kernel of $\\Phi$ is the normal subgroup $N$ generated by all elements of the form $i_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\omega)i_{\\beta\\alpha}(\\omega)^{-1}$\nfor $\\omega\\in\\pi_1(A_\\alpha\\cap A_\\beta)$, and hence $\\Phi$ induces an isomorphism $\\pi_1(X)\\cong \\ast_\\alpha\\pi_1(A_\\alpha)/N$. (I fix a basepoint for the rest of this question, all wedge sums are identified at this basepoint.) Back to wedge sums. If we are looking at the wedge sum $\\bigvee_\\alpha A_\\alpha$ where each $A_\\alpha$ is path connected, then these conditions are obviously true. And since the intersection of any $A_\\alpha$ is trivial, the fundamental group of the wedge sum is the free product of the groups. The only problem that I can see arising is when $A_\\alpha$ is not path connected. The fundamental group of a disconnected space $X\\cup Y$ is $\\pi_1(X)$ where the basepoint falls in $X$ (correct me if I am wrong, maybe I have over-simplified this). What is the fundamental group of this wedge sum, then? I would guess that it is $$\\ast_\\alpha\\pi_1(A_\\alpha^\\prime),$$\nwhere $A_\\alpha^\\prime$ is the component of $A_\\alpha$ containing the basepoint.  If so, then surely $\\pi_1(A_\\alpha)=\\pi_1(A_\\alpha^\\prime)$, and there is no problem after all, the fundamental group is just the free product of each fundamental group. Is this correct (the fundamental group is always $\\pi_1(\\bigvee A_\\alpha)=\\ast\\pi_1(A_\\alpha)$)? The simple example I scrawled on my piece of paper is below. I figure the fundamental group is\n$$\\pi_1(\\mathsf{Green}\\vee\\mathsf{Blue}\\vee\\mathsf{Red})=\\Bbb{Z}\\ast\\Bbb{Z}\\ast C_1=\\Bbb{Z}\\ast\\Bbb{Z},$$\nwhich makes sense, no loop at the basepoint can be in the leftmost or rightmost components, they must be (homotopic to a loop) in the figure eight graph. P.S. a side question, why do we use \\vee for the wedge sum rather than \\wedge ? Thanks in advance :-)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Under certain conditions they do actually mean the existence of neighborhoods, containing the common point $x_0$ of the wedge, which do retract on $x_0$ . With this condition we are able to choose suitable open path-connected sets $A_i$ to compute the desired fundamental group. For instance if you take the $n$ wedge of circles $S^1$ at $x_0$ you can compute its fundamental group via Van-Kampen. What is important here is that we have open neighborhoods $N_i$ containing $x_0$ for each circle $S^1$ of the wedge (just imagine a little open arc on $S^1$ which contains the center $x_0$ of the wedge) which do actually retract on $x_0$ (just shrink from both sides until you reach the center $x_0$ of the wedge). Now you can indeed define $A_i$ to be the wedge of all $N_j$ for $j \\neq i$ and wedge $S^1$ i.e. $$A_i=\\left(\\bigvee_{i \\neq j}N_j\\right) \\vee S^1.$$ If you now take two different $A_i$ 's, i.e. $A_i$ and $A_j$ and look at the intersection $A_i \\cap A_j$ you'll see that it's simply the wedge of all $n$ neighboorhoods $N_i$ of $x_0$ and since all of them retract to $x_0$ we get $$\\pi_1\\left( \\bigvee_{i=1}^nN_i\\right) \\cong \\pi_1(\\{x_0\\})=0.$$ By a similiar argument using your retracts you can compute $$\\pi_1(A_i) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb Z.$$ Now by applying Van Kampen you get that the fundamental group of your wedge sum is free of rank $n$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and filter out the unrelated information. The main question is about the fundamental group of a wedge sum in general, especially when van Kampen's theorem doesn't apply.\n\nThe original question starts by discussing van Kampen's theorem and its conditions. It mentions that for well-behaved spaces like CW complexes, the fundamental group of the wedge sum is the free product of the fundamental groups of the individual spaces. The user is confused about whether this holds in general, particularly when the spaces aren't path-connected. They also mention an example with different colored components (Green, Blue, Red) and conclude the fundamental group is the free product of Z, Z, and the trivial group, resulting in Z*Z. There's also a side question about the notation using \\vee instead of \\wedge.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The key points here are:\n\n1. Considering a wedge sum of spaces.\n2. Each space in the wedge sum is path-connected. Wait, no, the user actually raises the issue when the spaces might not be path-connected. The example given includes components (Green, Blue, Red) which are presumably each path-connected, but maybe not? Wait, the user says \"the component of A_α containing the basepoint\", so they are considering A_α that might not be path-connected, hence the need to take the component with the basepoint.\n\nSo the assumptions would include:\n\n- Each A_α is a topological space.\n- The wedge sum is formed by identifying each space at a basepoint.\n- Each A_α has a path-connected component containing the basepoint (since otherwise, the fundamental group of a non-path-connected space is determined by the component with the basepoint).\n\nThe problem is to determine the fundamental group of the wedge sum in general, particularly when van Kampen's theorem might not apply, but the user's conclusion seems to be that even if the individual spaces aren't path-connected, the fundamental group is the free product of the fundamental groups of the path-connected components containing the basepoint. So the problem is whether this is always true.\n\nWait, the user's question is phrased as: \"Is the fundamental group of the wedge sum always the free product of each fundamental group?\" But the user's own analysis suggests that if the spaces are not path-connected, then we should take the fundamental group of the component containing the basepoint for each A_α, and then take the free product. Therefore, the problem is to confirm whether π₁(⋁A_α) is isomorphic to the free product of π₁(A_α') where A_α' is the path component of A_α containing the basepoint.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- Each A_α is a topological space.\n- The wedge sum ⋁A_α is formed by identifying all basepoints of A_α into a single basepoint.\n- For each α, A_α has a path-connected component A_α' containing the basepoint.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that π₁(⋁A_α) is isomorphic to the free product of π₁(A_α').\n\nAlternatively, if the user is considering the case when the spaces may not be path-connected, but the wedge sum is formed by taking the path-connected component containing the basepoint for each A_α, then the problem is whether the fundamental group is the free product of those.\n\nBut the original question's core is: when van Kampen doesn't apply, what's the fundamental group of the wedge sum? The user's analysis leads them to think it's the free product of the fundamental groups of the path-connected components of each A_α containing the basepoint. They ask if this is correct.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- The wedge sum is formed by identifying each space at their respective basepoints.\n- Each space A_α may not be path-connected.\n- For each A_α, the basepoint is contained in a path-connected component A_α'.\n\nProblem: Determine whether the fundamental group of the wedge sum ⋁A_α is isomorphic to the free product of π₁(A_α').\n\nBut perhaps the user is simplifying and assuming that each A_α has a path-connected component containing the basepoint, so the main assumption is that each A_α is a topological space with a basepoint, and the wedge sum is formed by identifying those basepoints. Then the problem is to find the fundamental group of the wedge sum, considering that each A_α might not be path-connected.\n\nHowever, in standard terms, the fundamental group of a space depends only on the path-connected component containing the basepoint. So if A_α is not path-connected, π₁(A_α) is the fundamental group of the path component containing the basepoint. Therefore, even if A_α is not path-connected, when you take the wedge sum, you're only affecting the path component with the basepoint. So the fundamental group of the wedge sum would be the free product of the fundamental groups of each A_α's path component containing the basepoint.\n\nThus, the problem is: Given a wedge sum of spaces A_α, each with a basepoint in a path-connected component A_α', show that the fundamental group of the wedge sum is the free product of π₁(A_α').\n\nSo the assumptions would list:\n\n- Each A_α is a topological space with a basepoint.\n- Each A_α has a path-connected component A_α' containing the basepoint.\n- The wedge sum is formed by identifying all basepoints of A_α into a single basepoint.\n\nProblem: Prove that the fundamental group of the wedge sum is isomorphic to the free product of the fundamental groups of the A_α'.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is not assuming that each A_α has a path-connected component containing the basepoint, but instead considering that if they don't, then the fundamental group would be different. However, in standard definitions, the fundamental group is defined for a space with a basepoint, and only depends on the path component of that basepoint. So even if the entire space isn't path-connected, the fundamental group is only considering loops in the path component of the basepoint.\n\nTherefore, the problem as posed by the user seems to be confirming whether, even when the individual A_α are not path-connected, the fundamental group of the wedge sum is the free product of the fundamental groups of each A_α's path component containing the basepoint. Hence, the answer would be yes, and the assumptions are that each A_α has a path component containing the basepoint, and the wedge sum is formed by those basepoints.\n\nBut to structure this into the required format, the Assumptions section should list each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nEach A_α is a topological space with a basepoint,\nEach A_α has a path-connected component containing its basepoint,\nThe wedge sum is formed by identifying all basepoints of A_α into a single basepoint.\n\nProblem: Prove that the fundamental group of the wedge sum ⋁A_α is isomorphic to the free product of the fundamental groups of the path-connected components of A_α containing the basepoint.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement as in the user's own conclusion is phrased as whether π₁(⋁A_α) is always the free product of π₁(A_α), assuming each A_α is path-connected. But the user's confusion arises when A_α is not path-connected. Therefore, the problem is to determine π₁(⋁A_α) when each A_α is a space (possibly not path-connected), with the wedge sum formed at the basepoints lying in their respective path-connected components.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should capture this.",
