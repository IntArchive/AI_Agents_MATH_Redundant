    "Content": "As the title suggests. Let $G$ be a group, and suppose the function $\\phi: G \\to G$ with $\\phi(g)=g^3$ for $g \\in G$ is a homomorphism. Show that if $3 \\nmid |G|$, $G$ must be abelian. By considering $\\ker(\\phi)$ and Lagrange's Theorem, we have $\\phi$ must be an isomorphism (right?), but I'm not really sure where to go after that. This is a problem from Alperin and Bell, and it is not for homework.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that $(gh)^3=\\varphi(gh)=\\varphi(g)\\varphi(h)=g^3h^3$. This implies $ghghgh=ggghhh$, and hence after cancelling, $hghg=gghh$, or $(hg)^2=g^2h^2$. I claim that every element commutes with every square in $G$. Let $x\\in G$ be arbitrary, and let $a^2\\in G$ be an arbitrary square. Since $\\varphi$ is an automorphism (here is where we used the fact that $3\\nmid |G|$), $x=\\varphi(y)=y^3$ for some $y$. Then\n$$\nay^3a^{-1}=(aya^{-1})^3=\\varphi(aya^{-1})=a^3y^3a^{-3}\n$$\nwhich implies $y^3=a^2y^3a^{-2}$, or $y^3a^2=a^2y^3$. That is, $xa^2=a^2x$, and completes the claim. So in particular, $g^2h^2=h^2g^2$. So we get $hghg=(hg)^2=g^2h^2=h^2g^2=hhgg$. Cancelling yields $gh=hg$, so $G$ is abelian.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read the original question carefully. The user is asking about a group G where the function φ defined by φ(g) = g³ is a homomorphism. They want to show that if 3 doesn't divide the order of G, then G must be abelian. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem.\n\nThe first assumption is that φ: G → G defined by φ(g) = g³ is a homomorphism. So that's one condition on the group G. Then the second condition is that 3 does not divide the order of G, written as 3 ∤ |G|. So these are two separate assumptions. \n\nWait, the problem states \"if φ is a homomorphism and 3 ∤ |G|, then G is abelian.\" So the two assumptions are that φ is a homomorphism and that the order of G is not divisible by 3. Each of these should be separate points in the assumption list. \n\nThe user also mentions considering ker(φ) and Lagrange's theorem, leading to φ being an isomorphism. But that's part of their thought process, not the problem's assumptions. The actual problem doesn't include those steps as assumptions. So I need to filter that out. \n\nSo the formatted assumptions should be:\n- φ: G → G defined by φ(g) = g³ is a homomorphism.\n- 3 does not divide the order of G.\n\nThen the problem is to show that G is abelian under these conditions. \n\nLet me check the example provided. The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. \n\nIn this case, the problem's assumptions are the two conditions given (homomorphism and group order not divisible by 3), and the problem is to show G is abelian. \n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line. So the assumptions section will list each condition separately. The problem statement then is to prove G is abelian under those conditions. \n\nYes, that seems right. I don't see any other hidden assumptions. The user mentions ker(φ) and Lagrange's theorem as part of their attempt, but those are part of the solution, not the problem statement. So the formatted problem should capture exactly the given conditions and the required conclusion.",
