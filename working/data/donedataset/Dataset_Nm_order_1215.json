    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that the determinant of the adjugate matrix of A, denoted as adj(A), is equal to the determinant of A raised to the power of n-1, where A is an n×n matrix. The user mentioned knowing that A multiplied by its adjugate matrix equals det(A) times the identity matrix, which is a crucial property here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of the adjugate matrix. The adjugate, or adjoint, of a matrix A is the transpose of the cofactor matrix of A. The key property given is A·adj(A) = det(A)I. This seems like a starting point. \n\nIf I take the determinant of both sides of this equation, I can use properties of determinants to simplify. The determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants, so det(A·adj(A)) = det(det(A)I). On the left side, that becomes det(A) times det(adj(A)). On the right side, det(det(A)I) is det(A) raised to the power of n, because the identity matrix I has n diagonal entries each multiplied by det(A), and the determinant of a scalar multiple of the identity matrix is the scalar raised to the size of the matrix. \n\nSo now we have det(A) * det(adj(A)) = det(A)^n. Assuming that det(A) is not zero, we can divide both sides by det(A), leading to det(adj(A)) = det(A)^{n-1}. But wait, what if det(A) is zero? In that case, the original equation A·adj(A) = det(A)I becomes A·adj(A) = 0. If A is singular, its adjugate matrix has a rank of at most 1, which implies that adj(A) is also singular, so det(adj(A)) would be zero. Since det(A) is zero, det(A)^{n-1} is also zero. Thus, the formula holds even when det(A) is zero. \n\nTherefore, the proof holds for any n×n matrix A, regardless of whether it's invertible or not. The critical steps are applying the determinant to both sides of the key adjugate property and handling both cases where the determinant is non-zero and zero.",
