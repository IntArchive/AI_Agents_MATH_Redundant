    "Content": "The group: $$\nG = \\left\\langle x, y \\;  \\left| \\;  x^2 = y^3 = (xy)^7 = 1\\right. \\right\\rangle\n$$ is infinite, or so I've been told. How would I go about proving this? (To prove finiteness of a finitely presented group, I could do a coset enumeration, but I don't see how this helps if I want to prove that it's infinite.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\langle x,y \\; | \\; x^2=y^3=1 \\rangle \\cong \\operatorname{PSL}_2(\\mathbb Z)$ and this isomorphism identifies G with $\\operatorname{PSL}_2/T^7=1$ (where $T:z\\mapsto z+1$). Result is the symmetry group of the tiling of the hyperbolic plane. From this description one can see that G is infinite (e.g. because there are infinitely many triangles in the tiling and G acts on them transitively).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a certain group defined by a presentation is infinite. The group is given as G = ⟨x, y | x² = y³ = (xy)⁷ = 1⟩. The user mentioned that they were told it's infinite and want to know how to prove it. They also note that for finiteness, coset enumeration works, but they don't see how that helps for proving infiniteness.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about a group defined by generators and relations. The key assumptions here are the defining relations of the group. Each relation should be listed as a separate assumption. \n\nSo, the generators are x and y. The relations are x² = 1, y³ = 1, and (xy)⁷ = 1. Each of these relations applies to different elements in the group. The first relation applies to x, the second to y, and the third to the product xy. Therefore, each of these relations should be separate assumptions. \n\nAdditionally, the problem is to prove that G is infinite. There's no mention of any other constraints or conditions, so the assumptions are purely the relations given in the presentation. \n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Here, each relation is a condition on a specific element or product of elements. So, x² = 1 is one assumption on x, y³ = 1 is another on y, and (xy)⁷ = 1 is a third on the product xy. \n\nThe problem statement then is to prove that G, defined with these generators and relations, is infinite. The original question also mentions methods like coset enumeration for finiteness but seeks an approach for infiniteness. However, in the structured format, we just need the problem statement without the extra discussion about methods. So the problem is simply to prove that G is infinite.\n\nI should check the example given. In the example, the assumption listed was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. However, the user adjusted the assumption to include divisibility by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. Wait, no, the original example was that the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted version included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might have been a mistake. Wait, in the original problem, the user had the example where the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7; it was for every integer n. But perhaps that example was a mistake. However, the user provided that as their example, so perhaps in their structure, they list all conditions given in the problem. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo, but according to the user's example, they split the assumptions into each condition. Wait, the original example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted version added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. But perhaps the user's example had an error. But regardless, for the current problem, we need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem by listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current case, the group is defined by the presentation, so the assumptions are the relations. Each relation is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x² = 1,\n- y³ = 1,\n- (xy)^7 = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the group G is infinite.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single condition on one object. x²=1 is on x, y³=1 on y, (xy)^7=1 on xy. So each is separate. That should be correct. The problem is to show G is infinite under these relations.\n\nThe original question title and body mention the group presentation, so the key is to capture those relations as assumptions. The problem statement is straightforward once the assumptions are listed properly.",
