    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about proving that if the greatest common divisor of three integers a, b, and c is 1, then there exists some integer z such that the gcd of (az + b) and c is 1. Hmm, interesting. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the assumptions clearly. The problem states that gcd(a, b, c) = 1. That means that the three numbers a, b, and c don't all share any common divisor greater than 1. But does this imply anything about the pairwise gcds? For example, could a and b have a common divisor, as long as it doesn't divide c? Maybe. So the main condition here is that the three together are coprime, not necessarily each pair.\n\nThe goal is to find an integer z such that when you take a multiplied by z plus b, the result is coprime with c. In other words, az + b should share no common factors with c except 1. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or some properties of modular arithmetic? Or perhaps Bézout's identity? Since we're dealing with linear combinations and gcds, Bézout's might come into play here. \n\nAlternatively, the problem reminds me of the coprime Dirichlet theorem mentioned in the title. I know Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions states that there are infinitely many primes in an arithmetic progression a + nd where gcd(a, d) = 1. But this seems different. However, maybe the idea is similar: if we can find z such that az + b is in a progression that's coprime to c.\n\nLet me break down the problem. Let’s denote d = gcd(a, c). Then, since d divides both a and c, we can write a = d*a' and c = d*c', where gcd(a', c') = 1. Now, the original gcd(a, b, c) = 1. Since d divides a and c, if d also divided b, then gcd(a, b, c) would be at least d, but since it's 1, d must be 1? Wait, no. Wait, if d = gcd(a, c), then d divides a and c. Then, if d divided b, then gcd(a, b, c) would be d. But since gcd(a, b, c) is 1, then d must divide 1, so d = 1. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me check. If d = gcd(a, c), then d divides a and c. If d also divides b, then d would be a common divisor of a, b, c, hence d divides gcd(a, b, c) = 1, so d must be 1. Therefore, if d = gcd(a, c), then either d = 1 or d does not divide b. Wait, but if d is the gcd of a and c, and d doesn't divide b, then that's possible. But since gcd(a, b, c) = 1, then the only common divisor of all three is 1, but a and c could still have a common divisor greater than 1 as long as it doesn't divide b.\n\nSo, suppose that d = gcd(a, c). Then since gcd(a, b, c) = 1, we know that gcd(d, b) = 1. Because if there was a prime p dividing d and b, then p would divide a, c, and b, contradicting gcd(a, b, c) = 1. Therefore, gcd(d, b) = 1.\n\nNow, we can write a = d*a', c = d*c', where gcd(a', c') = 1. Then, the equation az + b becomes d*a'*z + b. We need to find z such that gcd(d*a'*z + b, d*c') = 1. \n\nLet me note that since c = d*c', and we need the gcd of (d*a'*z + b) and d*c' to be 1. Let’s split this into two parts: gcd(d*a'*z + b, d) and gcd(d*a'*z + b, c').\n\nFirst, gcd(d*a'*z + b, d). Since d divides the first term, d*a'*z, and we have b added to it. So, gcd(d*a'*z + b, d) = gcd(b, d). But earlier, we established that gcd(d, b) = 1. Therefore, gcd(d*a'*z + b, d) = 1.\n\nSecond, gcd(d*a'*z + b, c'). Since a' and c' are coprime, maybe we can find z such that d*a'*z + b ≡ 0 mod p for any prime p dividing c'? Wait, but we need d*a'*z + b to be coprime with c', so for each prime p dividing c', we need d*a'*z + b ≡ not ≡ 0 mod p. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here. Since c' is part of the original c, and we have that a' and c' are coprime, then the term a'*z can take on various residues mod c'. So, we can choose z such that a'*z ≡ -b/(d) mod p for each prime p dividing c'? Wait, but d and c' are coprime? Wait, c = d*c', and since d is the gcd of a and c, and we have that gcd(a', c')=1, so d and c' are coprime? Not necessarily. Wait, c = d*c', but d is the gcd of a and c. So, since a = d*a', then a' and c' must be coprime. Because if they had a common divisor, say k > 1, then k*d would divide both a and c, contradicting that d is the gcd.\n\nTherefore, a' and c' are coprime, and since d and c' are parts of the original c, but d is the gcd(a, c), so d divides c, so c' = c/d. Therefore, c' is an integer. \n\nSo, to make d*a'*z + b coprime to c', we need that for each prime p dividing c', p does not divide d*a'*z + b. Since a' and c' are coprime, the coefficient of z in the term a'*z is coprime to c', so the linear congruence a'*z ≡ -b/d mod p has a solution because a' and p are coprime (since a' and c' are coprime, and p divides c'). Therefore, for each prime p dividing c', we can choose z such that a'*z ≡ -b/d mod p. Then, d*a'*z + b ≡ d*(-b/d) + b ≡ -b + b ≡ 0 mod p. Wait, but that would make d*a'*z + b divisible by p, which is the opposite of what we want. Hmm, maybe I need to avoid those congruences.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to ensure that d*a'*z + b ≡ something not 0 mod p. Since a' and p are coprime, the term a'*z can take any residue mod p as z varies. Therefore, we can choose z such that a'*z ≡ k mod p, where k ≡ (-b/d + 1) mod p, so that d*a'*z + b ≡ d*(k) + b ≡ d*(-b/d + 1) + b ≡ -b + d + b ≡ d mod p. Since d and p are coprime? Wait, d is the gcd(a, c), and p divides c', which is c/d. Therefore, p divides c/d, so p divides c but p does not divide d (since d is the gcd(a, c), and if p divided d, then p would divide a and c, so p would divide c/d only if p divided c more times than in d, but c = d*c', so c' is the part of c after factoring out d. So p divides c', but p does not divide d. Therefore, gcd(d, p) = 1. Therefore, d and p are coprime. Therefore, if we set d*a'*z + b ≡ d mod p, which is equivalent to a'*z ≡ (d - b)/d mod p. Since a' and p are coprime, this congruence has a solution for z. Then, d*a'*z + b ≡ d mod p, which is coprime to p since d and p are coprime. Therefore, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find such a z that satisfies this congruence for all primes p dividing c'. Therefore, for each prime p dividing c', we can choose z such that d*a'*z + b is not divisible by p, and since gcd(d, c') = 1 (as d divides a and c, and c' is c/d with gcd(a', c')=1), then the overall gcd(d*a'*z + b, c') = 1. \n\nTherefore, combining both parts, since gcd(d*a'*z + b, d) = 1 and gcd(d*a'*z + b, c') = 1, and since d and c' are coprime, then the overall gcd(d*a'*z + b, d*c') = 1. Therefore, such a z exists. \n\nWait, but how do we know that we can satisfy all these congruences simultaneously? Because for each prime p dividing c', we have a congruence condition on z. Since the primes dividing c' are distinct (in the CRT sense), we can find a z that satisfies all of them simultaneously. Therefore, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, such a z exists. \n\nTherefore, putting this all together, we can construct such a z. Therefore, the proof would involve breaking down the gcd(a, c) = d, showing that gcd(d, b) = 1, then using CRT to find z such that az + b is coprime to both d and c', hence to c. \n\nBut wait, in the beginning, we split c into d and c', where d = gcd(a, c). Then, since gcd(d, c') = 1 (because c' = c/d, and d is the part already factored out), so c = d*c', gcd(d, c') = 1. Then, since we want gcd(az + b, c) = gcd(az + b, d*c') = gcd(az + b, d) * gcd(az + b, c'). But we already established that gcd(az + b, d) = gcd(b, d) = 1. Then, for gcd(az + b, c'), we need to ensure it's 1 by choosing z appropriately. Since a = d*a', then az + b = d*a'z + b. So, modulo c', this is equivalent to (d*a')z + b mod c'. But since d and c' are coprime (as gcd(d, c')=1), and a' and c' are coprime (from earlier), then the coefficient of z, which is d*a', is coprime to c'. Therefore, the linear function (d*a')z + b mod c' can take any value as z varies, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Therefore, there exists a z such that (d*a')z + b ≡ 1 mod c', making the gcd 1. Hence, gcd(az + b, c) = 1*1 = 1. \n\nTherefore, this approach seems valid. The key steps are factoring out the gcd(a, c) = d, using the fact that gcd(d, b) = 1, and then solving for z in the modulus c' to make the expression coprime to c'. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is using the fact that since gcd(a, c) = d, then the image of the linear function az + b modulo c' must cover all residues, because a and c' are coprime (since a = d*a', and gcd(a', c')=1, and d and c' are coprime). Therefore, as z varies, az mod c' cycles through all residues, hence az + b mod c' also cycles through all residues. Therefore, there must exist some z such that az + b ≡ 1 mod c', making gcd(az + b, c') = 1. \n\nTherefore, combining with gcd(az + b, d) = 1, we get the result. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the assumptions are that a, b, c are integers with gcd(a, b, c) = 1, and c ≠ 0. The problem is to prove there exists an integer z such that gcd(az + b, c) = 1. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"the only constraint is that a,b,c,z are integers and c ≠ 0\". So the only conditions given are that a, b, c are integers with gcd(a, b, c) = 1, and c ≠ 0. So in the assumptions, we need to list each condition separately. Let me check the example provided. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line addressing one property or condition. \n\nSo for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c are integers,\n- c ≠ 0,\n- gcd(a, b, c) = 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The problem is to prove that there exists an integer z such that gcd(az + b, c) = 1. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions line by line and then state the problem.",
