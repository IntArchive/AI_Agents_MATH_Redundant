    "Content": "Show that the closed ball in $C([0,1])$ of center $0$ and radius $1$ is not compact. I thought it will be compact since every closed and bounded set in $\\mathbb{R}$ is compact? Why is it not compact and how can I prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $f_n$ be zero except on $[\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{n+1}+\\frac{1}{n}), \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{n-1})]$, where the graph is described by joining the points\n$(\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{n+1}+\\frac{1}{n}),0), (\\frac{1}{n},1), (\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{n-1}),0)$. Then $\\operatorname{supp} f_n = [\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{n+1}+\\frac{1}{n}), \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{n-1})]$, and $f_n(\\frac{1}{n}) = 1$. Hence $\\|f_n-f_m\\| = \\delta_{mn}$. The collection $\\{ B(x, \\frac{1}{2}) \\}_x$ is an open cover of $C[0,1]$. If we take any finite sub-collection, then at most one of the $f_k$ can be contained in each one, so the finite sub-collection can contain only a finite number of $f_n$. It follows that $C[0,1]$ is not compact.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the closed ball in C([0,1]) centered at 0 with radius 1 is not compact. Hmm, I remember that in finite-dimensional spaces like R^n, closed and bounded sets are compact by Heine-Borel. But C([0,1]) is an infinite-dimensional space, right? So Heine-Borel doesn't apply here. That explains why the user is confused because they're thinking in terms of R.\n\nTo prove the closed ball isn't compact, I need to use a property of compactness in metric spaces. One common approach is to show that the closed ball isn't sequentially compact. That is, find a sequence in the ball that has no convergent subsequence. Alternatively, show that the space isn't totally bounded.\n\nWait, in metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to being complete and totally bounded. Since C([0,1]) with the sup norm is a Banach space (hence complete), if the closed ball were compact, it would have to be totally bounded. But maybe it's not. Alternatively, constructing a sequence with no convergent subsequence would do.\n\nAnother idea: use the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, which states that a subset of C([0,1]) is compact if and only if it's closed, bounded, and equicontinuous. The closed unit ball is closed and bounded, so if it's not compact, it must fail equicontinuity. Therefore, to show the closed ball isn't compact, show that it's not equicontinuous.\n\nBut how to demonstrate that? Maybe construct a sequence of functions in the closed ball that isn't equicontinuous. For example, consider functions that become steeper as n increases. Like f_n(x) = x^n. Wait, in C([0,1]) with sup norm, f_n converges pointwise to 0 except at x=1. But the sup norm of f_n is 1 for all n, so they're in the closed ball. However, the sequence f_n has no uniformly convergent subsequence because the limit would have to be discontinuous at x=1, but in C([0,1]), convergence is uniform. Wait, actually, the pointwise limit is not continuous, but uniform convergence preserves continuity. So if a subsequence of f_n converges uniformly, the limit would be continuous. But since f_n converges pointwise to a discontinuous function, no subsequence can converge uniformly. Hence, the sequence f_n is in the closed unit ball but has no convergent subsequence, proving the closed ball isn't compact.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is using the fact that in infinite-dimensional normed spaces, the closed unit ball is never compact. So maybe cite Riesz's lemma or something. But the question is in C([0,1]), so perhaps construct a sequence of functions with norm 1 where the distance between any two is at least 1/2. For example, consider functions that are 1 at some point and 0 elsewhere, connected by linear segments. Wait, but in C([0,1]), functions must be continuous. Maybe use bump functions that have disjoint supports. Let's say, for each n, define f_n to be a triangle function with peak at 1/n, going from 0 at 0 to peak at 1/n, then back to 0 at 2/n. Then for n large enough, these functions have disjoint supports. The sup norm of each f_n is 1. Then the distance between any two distinct f_n and f_m would be 1, since their supports don't overlap. So in the sup norm, ||f_n - f_m|| = 1. Hence, this sequence has no convergent subsequence because any subsequence would not be Cauchy. Thus, the closed unit ball isn't compact.\n\nEither approach works. The key point is that in infinite-dimensional spaces, closed and bounded doesn't imply compact. The problem is asking to show this specifically for C([0,1]) with the sup norm. So the user needs to structure the problem by listing assumptions and then the problem. The original question mentions the closed ball in C([0,1]) centered at 0, radius 1. So the assumptions would be about the space, the norm, the center, radius, and perhaps the closedness. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Show that the closed ball in C([0,1]) of center 0 and radius 1 is not compact.\" The user also mentions confusion because in R, closed and bounded implies compact. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- The space is C([0,1]), the set of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1].\n- The norm is the sup norm (since that's the standard norm on C([0,1])).\n- The closed ball is centered at 0 (the zero function).\n- The radius is 1.\n- The problem is to show this closed ball is not compact.\n\nSo when structuring the problem, the assumptions should list these properties. Each assumption should address one property. Let's see:\n\nAssumption:\n\nC([0,1]) is the space of continuous functions on [0,1],\nThe norm on C([0,1]) is the sup norm,\nThe closed ball is centered at the zero function,\nThe radius of the closed ball is 1,\nCompactness is considered with respect to the sup norm topology.\n\nProblem: Show that the closed ball in C([0,1]) of center 0 and radius 1 is not compact.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't specify the norm, but in C([0,1]), when talking about closed balls, the norm is usually specified. Since the user didn't mention, but the standard is sup norm. However, if someone uses a different norm, the result might differ, but in the context of the problem, since the user is referring to the standard case, we can assume sup norm.\n\nBut to be precise, maybe include the norm as an assumption. Let me check the example given in the original query. The example had assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is one line, each about one property of one object.\n\nSo here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The space is C([0,1]), the space of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1].\n- The norm considered is the supremum norm.\n- The closed ball is centered at the zero function.\n- The radius of the closed ball is 1.\n- The problem is to show this closed ball is not compact.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. For example, the problem is to show the closed ball in C([0,1]) under sup norm, centered at 0 with radius 1 is not compact. So the assumptions are inherent in the problem statement.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumption part lists all the conditions given. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user's formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Hmm, perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example. Alternatively, maybe the user wanted to filter out unrelated information. Wait, perhaps the original problem had an error and the correct problem requires n divisible by 7? Not sure. But in any case, the example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nSo, applying that here, the original problem states:\n\n\"Show that the closed ball in C([0,1]) of center 0 and radius 1 is not compact.\"\n\nSo the assumptions would include:\n\n- C([0,1]) is the space of continuous functions on [0,1],\n- The norm is the supremum norm (since closed ball is defined using the norm),\n- The closed ball is centered at 0,\n- The radius is 1,\n- The topology is induced by the supremum norm.\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. For instance, C([0,1]) is typically equipped with the sup norm unless specified otherwise. But to be precise, perhaps list the norm as an assumption. Alternatively, since the problem mentions \"closed ball\", which is a concept from metric spaces, so the metric is induced by the norm. But since the user is asking to structure the problem, perhaps list each necessary condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main assumption is that the closed ball is in C([0,1]) with the sup norm, center 0, radius 1. So each of these would be separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nC([0,1]) is the space of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1],\nThe norm on C([0,1]) is the supremum norm,\nThe closed ball is centered at the zero function,\nThe radius of the closed ball is 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the closed ball in C([0,1]) of center 0 and radius 1 is not compact.\n\nBut the original question didn't specify real-valued, but in the context, it's likely. But since the user's example didn't specify details like real-valued, maybe omit that unless necessary. Alternatively, if the problem is in real-valued functions, that's an assumption. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nC([0,1]) is the space of continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ,\nC([0,1]) is equipped with the supremum norm,\nThe closed ball is defined with center at the zero function,\nThe radius of the closed ball is 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the closed ball in C([0,1]) of center 0 and radius 1 is not compact.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The key points are the space, the norm, the center, and the radius. Then the problem is to show non-compactness.",
