    "Content": "I've been working through the Munkres Topology text on my own, and I am not sure if the following argument is correct.  Fishing around the internet a bit for some alternative answers and it looks like the approaches others have taken to this problem are not the same way that I approached it, so I'm concerned that I'm making some conceptual errors.  The problem: Let {A$_{\\alpha}$} be a collection of subsets of X.  Let X=$\\cup_{\\alpha}$A$_{\\alpha}$.  Let f: X$\\rightarrow$Y; suppose that f$\\mid$A$_{\\alpha}$ is continuous for each $\\alpha$.  An indexed family of sets {A$_{\\alpha}$} is said to be locally finite if each point of X has a neighborhood that intersects A$_{\\alpha}$ for only finitely many values of $\\alpha$.  Show that if the family {A$_{\\alpha}$} is locally finite and each A$_{\\alpha}$ is closed, then f is continuous. Attempt at solution: Let x $\\in$ X.  Since there exists a neighborhood U$_{x}$ of x that intersects A$_{\\alpha}$ for only finitely many $\\alpha$, U$_{x}$ can be contained in a finite collection of A$_{\\alpha}$'s.  So x $\\in$ U$_{x}$ $\\subset$ $\\cup_{i=1}^{n}$A$_{i}$ $\\subset$ X.  Then, since each A$_{i}$ is closed and f$\\mid$A$_{i}$ continuous for each i, by repeated application of the Pasting Lemma, f$\\mid$$\\cup_{i=1}^{n}$A$_{i}$ is continuous.  Then, since U$_{x}$ $\\subset$ $\\cup_{i=1}^{n}$A$_{i}$, by restricting the domain (Theorem 18.2d), f$\\mid$U$_{x}$ continuous.  Since it is given that such a neighborhood U$_{x}$ exists for each x $\\in$ X, then X can be written as the union of open sets U$_{x}$, where f$\\mid$U$_{x}$ is continuous for each x, and so by Theorem 18.2f (local formulation of continuity), f: X$\\rightarrow$Y is continuous. Feel like I'm missing something, or making some incorrect assumptions.  Any help would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your argument is fine. An alternative that you may have encountered is first to prove the very useful fact that locally finite families are closure-preserving, meaning that if $\\mathscr{C}$ is any locally finite family of sets, $\\operatorname{cl}\\bigcup\\mathscr{C}=\\bigcup_{C\\in\\mathscr{C}}\\operatorname{cl}C$ . Then let $F$ be any closed subset of $Y$ , and for each $\\alpha\\in A$ let $C_\\alpha=(f\\upharpoonright A_\\alpha)^{-1}[F]\\subseteq A_\\alpha$ . Then $C_\\alpha$ is closed in $A_\\alpha$ (since $f\\upharpoonright A_\\alpha$ is continuous) and hence in $X$ . Moreover, $\\mathscr{C}=\\{C_\\alpha:\\alpha\\in A\\}$ is easily seen to be locally finite, so $$f^{-1}[F]=\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in A}C_\\alpha=\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in A}\\operatorname{cl}C_\\alpha=\\operatorname{cl}\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in A}C_\\alpha=\\operatorname{cl}F\\;,$$ and $F$ is closed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure the problem based on the user's example. First, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants me to extract the assumptions and the problem statement in a specific format.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is restated clearly.\n\nThe original problem here is about topology. The user mentions Munkres Chapter 2, dealing with locally finite families of sets. The task is to show that if the family {A_α} is locally finite and each A_α is closed, then the function f is continuous, given that f restricted to each A_α is continuous.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n1. The problem starts by defining a collection of subsets {A_α} of X, with X being the union of all A_α. So assumption: {A_α} is a collection of subsets of X, X = ∪A_α.\n\n2. There's a function f: X → Y, and f restricted to each A_α is continuous. So assumption: f|A_α is continuous for each α.\n\n3. The family {A_α} is locally finite. Locally finite means each point in X has a neighborhood intersecting only finitely many A_α. So assumption: {A_α} is a locally finite family.\n\n4. Each A_α is closed. So assumption: Each A_α is closed.\n\nThese are the main assumptions. The problem is to show that under these conditions, f is continuous.\n\nNow, need to structure this according to the format. Each assumption should be a separate line, each addressing one property. Let me check again:\n\n- The collection {A_α} is a family of subsets covering X (since X is the union). So that's one assumption: {A_α} is a collection of subsets of X, X = ∪_{α} A_{α}.\n\nWait, in the example, they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two separate assumptions. Here, maybe \"X is the union of the collection {A_α}\" is one assumption, and the collection {A_α} is part of the problem setup. But in the original problem, the user starts with \"Let {A_α} be a collection of subsets of X. Let X = ∪A_α.\" So these are two separate conditions.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\n{A_α} is a collection of subsets of X,\nX = ∪_{α} A_{α},\nf: X → Y,\nf|A_α is continuous for each α,\n{A_α} is locally finite,\nEach A_α is closed.\n\nBut wait, \"f: X → Y\" is a given, not an assumption per se. However, in the example, the function's definition is part of the problem. So perhaps \"f: X → Y\" is an assumption here, as the problem is about the continuity of f.\n\nSo each bullet point:\n\n1. {A_α} is a collection of subsets of X.\n\n2. X = ∪_{α} A_{α}.\n\n3. f: X → Y.\n\n4. For each α, the restriction f|A_α is continuous.\n\n5. The family {A_α} is locally finite.\n\n6. Each A_α is closed.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to show that f is continuous.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n{A_α} is a collection of subsets of X,\nX = ∪_{α} A_{α},\nf: X → Y,\nf|A_α is continuous for each α,\nThe family {A_α} is locally finite,\nEach A_α is closed.\nProblem:\nShow that f is continuous.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nI think this captures all the necessary conditions. Let me double-check the original problem statement. The user wrote:\n\n\"Let {A_α} be a collection of subsets of X. Let X=∪_{α}A_α. Let f: X→Y; suppose that f|A_α is continuous for each α. ... Show that if the family {A_α} is locally finite and each A_α is closed, then f is continuous.\"\n\nSo yes, all these are given conditions. The key assumptions here are the locally finite family, each A_α closed, and the function restricted to each A_α is continuous. The other parts (collection of subsets, X being the union, f being a function from X to Y) are setup but necessary for the problem. So each should be listed as separate assumptions.",
