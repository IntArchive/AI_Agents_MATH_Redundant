    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The question is about proving that the gradient of the squared 2-norm of x is equal to 2x. The original problem statement is: \"Could someone please provide a proof for why the gradient of the squared $2$ -norm of $x$ is equal to $2x$? $$\\nabla\\|x\\|_2^2 = 2x$$\"\n\nNow, I need to identify the assumptions. The example given in the problem had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So, assumptions are the conditions or properties that apply to the objects in the problem. \n\nLooking at this gradient problem, the function in question is the squared 2-norm of x, which is ||x||₂². The gradient is being taken with respect to x, which implies that x is a vector. Since the gradient is involved, the function must be differentiable. However, the squared 2-norm is differentiable everywhere, so maybe that's an implicit assumption. But do I need to state that x is a vector in Euclidean space? Or that x is a real vector? \n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key object is x. So possible assumptions could be:\n\n1. x is a real vector (since the norm is defined for real vectors, unless specified otherwise, but sometimes complex vectors are considered, but the gradient in complex case might be different).\n2. The function considered is the squared Euclidean norm, which is differentiable everywhere.\n\nBut the problem statement itself is asking for the gradient, which assumes that the function is differentiable. However, the squared 2-norm is always differentiable, so maybe that's not an assumption but a given. But perhaps the user is working in a real vector space, so we need to note that x is a real vector.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that x is in R^n, a real n-dimensional space, and that we are taking the gradient with respect to x in that space.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real vector,\nThe norm considered is the Euclidean norm (2-norm).\n\nWait, but the problem already mentions the 2-norm, so maybe the second assumption is redundant. The key is to list each assumption that is necessary but not explicitly stated. The problem states \"squared 2-norm of x\", so the norm is given. But perhaps the assumption is that x is a real vector, because if x were complex, the gradient would be different. Since the answer expects 2x, which is the real case, we can assume x is real.\n\nSo, the main assumption here is that x is a real vector. The problem is to compute the gradient of the squared 2-norm, which is differentiable, so no need to assume differentiability because the squared norm is smooth.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real vector.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the gradient of the squared 2-norm of x is equal to 2x, i.e., $$\\nabla\\|x\\|_2^2 = 2x.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that was not stated in the original problem. For instance, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted example added an extra assumption. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated information, so perhaps the original problem had more context where n needed to be divisible by 7, but in the example provided, the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo or the user restructured it with an incorrect assumption. Hmm, this is confusing. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to format the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking for the gradient of the squared 2-norm. The standard result is that the gradient is 2x, but this holds when x is a real vector. If x were complex, the gradient would be different (conjugate or something else). Therefore, the key assumption here is that x is a real vector. The problem statement doesn't specify that, so to make the proof valid, that assumption is necessary. Therefore, the assumption is \"x is a real vector.\"\n\nThe problem is then to prove that the gradient is 2x.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real vector.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the gradient of the squared 2-norm of x is equal to 2x, i.e., $$\\nabla\\|x\\|_2^2 = 2x.$$\n\nI think that's it. There's only one assumption here, which is that x is a real vector. The problem is straightforward once that assumption is made explicit.",
