    "Content": "This is related to this old MO question which wasn't answered properly, though I don't feel I phrased the question in the best way (or posted it on the right site) Define the abelianization of a group $G$ to be the quotient group $G_{ab} := G/[G,G]$, where $[G,G]$ is the commutator subgroup . I want to know how this definition implies the following property of abelianization. Let $\\phi: G \\to G_{ab}$ be the canonical surjection. For any abelian group $H$ and homomorphism $f:G\\to H$, there exists a unique homomorphism $F: G_{ab} \\to H$ such that $f = F\\circ \\phi$. This is the ability to 'descend to a homomorphism' that I explained so badly in my initial post, though at the time it was the only terminology I heard being used. I am aware that these two definitions are equivalent but I have not yet seen a proof, nor managed to prove it myself. Please do point me to an online proof if you know of one.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $f : G \\to H$ is a homomorphism to an abelian group, then $f(ab) =  f(a) f(b) = f(b) f(a) = f(ba)$, hence $[a, b] \\in \\ker f$, hence $[G, G] \\subseteq \\ker f$. Is the rest clear from here?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original question and identify the assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe original question is about the property of abelianization. The user mentions two definitions being equivalent: one is the definition of abelianization as the quotient group G_ab = G/[G,G], and the other is the universal property that any homomorphism from G to an abelian group H factors uniquely through the canonical surjection φ: G → G_ab. The user is asking for a proof that these two definitions are equivalent.\n\nSo, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from this. Let's parse the question carefully.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. G is a group.\n2. G_ab is defined as G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup.\n3. φ: G → G_ab is the canonical surjection.\n4. H is an abelian group.\n5. f: G → H is a homomorphism.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a unique homomorphism F: G_ab → H such that f = F ∘ φ.\n\nWait, the original problem states that the two definitions (the quotient group definition and the universal property) are equivalent. However, in the example provided in the user's instruction, the assumptions were listing conditions on the problem's objects. Here, the problem is to show the universal property given the definition of abelianization. So, the assumptions are the setup for this problem: G is a group, H is abelian, f is a homomorphism from G to H, etc.\n\nBut the original question says \"how this definition implies the following property\", so the problem is to prove the universal property starting from the definition of abelianization as G/[G,G]. Therefore, the assumptions should include the definition of abelianization and the given conditions (like H being abelian, f being a homomorphism), and the problem is to show the existence and uniqueness of F.\n\nSo, listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group.\n- G_{ab} is the quotient group G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup of G.\n- φ: G → G_{ab} is the canonical surjection.\n- H is an abelian group.\n- f: G → H is a homomorphism.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a unique homomorphism F: G_{ab} → H such that f = F ∘ φ.\n\nI should check if there are any other assumptions. The original problem mentions that H is abelian and f is a homomorphism, which are necessary conditions for the universal property. The commutator subgroup [G,G] is part of the definition of G_ab. The canonical surjection φ is part of the setup. So these all are the necessary assumptions. Each is a separate condition on one object (G, G_ab, φ, H, f). Therefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and the problem statement as above.\n\nI need to make sure that the example provided by the user is followed. In their example, they listed the assumptions as two separate lines: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. In this case, the problem's assumptions are the definitions and conditions given in the question. So following that structure, each line is a single assumption, each applying to one object. Therefore, my list of assumptions above fits that format.",
