    "Content": "Let $(X_n, d_n)$ be a sequence of metric spaces. Show that the function $ d: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb R^+$ on the product space $X: = \\prod_n X_n$ defined by $$d ((x_n)_{n = 1}^\\infty, (y_n)_{n=1}^\\infty ) := \\sum_{ n=1}^\\infty 2^{-n} \\frac{ d_n(x_n,y_n)} { 1+ d_n (x_n,y_n) } $$ is a metric on $X$ which generates the product topology on $X$. I showed that $d$ is actually a metric, which was easy. To show that this metric generates the product topology I think I need to show: (i) Each ball $ B((x_n)_{n=1}^\\infty  , \\epsilon )$ is open in the product topology. (ii) For any $B(x_n , \\epsilon) \\subset X_n$, $\\pi_n ^{-1} (B(x_n , \\epsilon)) \\subset X$ is the union of finite intersections of balls in $(X, d)$. But I couldn't even get started to do (i). Any help is appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that if $(X,d)$ is metric space, then $d'=d/(1+d)$ generates same topology of $(X,d)$. So we only prove this proposition: Let $(X_n,d_n)$ be a sequence of metric spaces, and $d_n(x,y)\\le 1$ for all $n$ and $x,y\\in X_n$, then $d((x_n),(y_n))=\\sum_n 2^{-n} d_n(x_n,y_n)$ generates the product topology of $X=\\prod_n X_n$. At first, we prove that for each $a=(a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty\\in X$ and $r>0$, there is a open basis $V$ of $X$ satisfy that $a\\in V\\subset B_d(a,r)$.\nLet $N$ be a natural number that satisfy $2^{-N}\\le r/2$. Consider\n$$\nV= B_1 (a_1,r/2)\\times \\cdots\\times B_N (a_N,r/2)\\times X_{N+1}\\times X_{N+2}\\times\\cdots\n$$\n(where $B_i(x,r)$ is a open ball in $X_i$.) If $x\\in V$ then $d(a_i,x_i)<r/2$ for \n$i=1,2,\\cdots, N$.

Finally, you prove that for each $a\\in X$ and for each basis $V$ of $X$ that contaning $a$ \nthere is $r$ satisfy that $a\\in B_d(a,r)\\subset V$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the given metric d generates the product topology on X. They already proved that d is a metric, so the focus is on part (i) and (ii). The user is stuck on part (i), which is showing that each ball in the metric d is open in the product topology. Let me recall the definitions here.\n\nFirst, the product topology on X is generated by the basis consisting of sets that are products of open sets in each X_n, where only finitely many are not the entire space. So, to show that the metric topology induced by d is the same as the product topology, we need to show that every open set in the metric topology is open in the product topology and vice versa.\n\nBut the user is specifically trying to show that each metric ball is open in the product topology (i) and that the preimages under projections of open sets in X_n can be expressed as unions of finite intersections of metric balls (ii). Let me parse the problem again.\n\nAssumptions: The problem states that (X_n, d_n) is a sequence of metric spaces. The product space X is the product of these X_n. The metric d is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of 2^{-n} * d_n(x_n,y_n)/(1 + d_n(x_n,y_n)). So, each term in the sum is bounded by 2^{-n} since d_n/(1+d_n) <1.\n\nTo show that d generates the product topology, the standard approach is to show that the identity map from (X, product topology) to (X, metric topology) is a homeomorphism. This can be done by showing that every open set in one topology is open in the other.\n\nBut the user's approach is (i) show metric balls are open in product topology, which would mean metric topology is coarser than product topology, and (ii) show that the preimages under projections (which are subbasic open sets in the product topology) can be written as unions of finite intersections of metric balls, implying that product topology is coarser than metric topology. Hence, both (i) and (ii) together would show the topologies coincide.\n\nFor part (i), take a metric ball B_d(x, ε). Need to show this is open in product topology. So, for any point y in B_d(x, ε), we need to find a basic open set in the product topology (i.e., a set that restricts finitely many coordinates to be within some open balls) such that y is in that basic open set and the entire set is contained in B_d(x, ε).\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that convergence in the metric d is equivalent to coordinate-wise convergence, which is equivalent to convergence in the product topology. But maybe that's a different approach. However, the user is trying to do (i) and (ii).\n\nLet me think about part (i). Let x = (x_n) be a point in X, and take a ball B_d(x, ε). Let y be a point in B_d(x, ε), so d(x,y) < ε. Need to find a product topology neighborhood around y contained in B_d(x, ε).\n\nSince d(x,y) = sum_{n=1}^∞ 2^{-n} * d_n(x_n,y_n)/(1 + d_n(x_n,y_n)) < ε. Let’s denote a_n = d_n(x_n,y_n)/(1 + d_n(x_n,y_n)). Then sum_{n=1}^∞ 2^{-n} a_n < ε. Each a_n <1.\n\nWe need to find a neighborhood around y such that for any z in this neighborhood, d(y,z) is small enough so that d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z) < ε. Wait, no, that might not work. Because we need z to satisfy sum 2^{-n} [d_n(x_n,z_n)/(1 + d_n(x_n,z_n)] < ε. But since y is already in B_d(x, ε), maybe we can find a neighborhood where the difference between y and z is controlled in such a way that the sum remains less than ε.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the metric d is compatible with the product topology by showing that basic open sets in the product topology are open in the metric topology and vice versa.\n\nWait, but the user is approaching it as (i) metric balls are product open, and (ii) product open sets are unions of finite intersections of metric balls. Let's focus on (i).\n\nSuppose we have a point y in B_d(x, ε). Let δ = ε - d(x,y) > 0. We need to find a product open set around y contained in B_d(x, ε). Since the product topology is generated by cylinders, maybe we can fix finitely many coordinates and control the sum.\n\nFor example, choose N such that sum_{n=N+1}^∞ 2^{-n} < δ/2. Then, for the first N coordinates, we can require that d_n(y_n, z_n) < some η for each n ≤ N, which would make the sum over the first N terms contribute less than δ/2. Then the total sum would be less than d(x,y) + δ/2 + δ/2 = ε. But how to formalize this?\n\nLet me think. Let’s set N so that sum_{n=N+1}^∞ 2^{-n} < δ/2. For each of the first N coordinates, since d_n(y_n, z_n)/(1 + d_n(y_n, z_n)) ≤ d_n(y_n, z_n), we can set η_n such that 2^{-n} * [d_n(y_n, z_n)/(1 + d_n(y_n, z_n))] < (δ)/(2N) for each n ≤ N. Then, if we take z_n in B_{d_n}(y_n, η_n) for each n ≤ N, and z_n = y_n for n > N, then the sum would be sum_{n=1}^N [something] + sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty 2^{-n} * [0] < sum_{n=1}^N (δ/(2N)) + δ/2 = δ/2 + δ/2 = δ. Thus, d(y,z) < δ, so d(x,z) ≤ d(x,y) + d(y,z) < d(x,y) + δ = ε. Hence, z is in B_d(x, ε). Therefore, the product open set around y, which restricts the first N coordinates to be within η_n of y_n, is contained in B_d(x, ε). Therefore, B_d(x, ε) is open in the product topology. So part (i) is done.\n\nFor part (ii), the user wants to show that for any open set in X_n under the projection π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)), this set can be written as a union of finite intersections of metric balls. But π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)) is the set of all points in X where the nth coordinate is within ε of x_n. To show this is a union of finite intersections of metric balls. Maybe take a point y in π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)), so d_n(y_n, x_n) < ε. Need to find a metric ball around y (in the metric d) such that all z in this ball satisfy d_n(z_n, x_n) < ε. But how?\n\nWait, the problem might be better approached by noting that the product topology is generated by the subbasis of sets π_n^{-1}(U_n), where U_n is open in X_n. So, to show that these are open in the metric topology, we need to show that each π_n^{-1}(U_n) is open in the metric topology. Since the metric topology is generated by the balls, then π_n^{-1}(U_n) must be expressible as a union of metric balls. Alternatively, take a point y in π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)), so y_n is in B(x_n, ε). We need to find a metric ball around y such that if z is in this ball, then z_n is in B(x_n, ε). How?\n\nBut the metric d involves all coordinates. However, if we can ensure that the nth term in the sum for d(y,z) is small enough so that d_n(y_n, z_n) is controlled. Since d_n(y_n, z_n)/(1 + d_n(y_n, z_n)) ≤ d(y,z) * 2^n. Because the nth term in the sum is 2^{-n} * [d_n/(1 + d_n)], so [d_n/(1 + d_n)] = 2^n * (term in sum). Therefore, if d(y,z) < 2^{-n} * η, then [d_n/(1 + d_n)] < η. Therefore, d_n(y_n, z_n) < η/(1 - η). So, if we choose η such that η/(1 - η) < δ, then d_n(y_n, z_n) < δ. Therefore, taking η = δ/(1 + δ), we have d_n < δ.\n\nSo, to ensure that z_n is within δ of y_n, we can require that d(y,z) < 2^{-n} * η, which would imply that the nth term in the sum is less than η, hence d_n(y_n, z_n) < η/(1 - η). If we set η such that η/(1 - η) = δ, then η = δ/(1 + δ). Therefore, if we take a ball around y with radius 2^{-n} * δ/(1 + δ), then any z in this ball will have d_n(y_n, z_n) < δ. Therefore, if we set δ = ε - d_n(x_n, y_n), which is positive since y_n is in B(x_n, ε), then z_n will be in B(x_n, ε). Hence, the metric ball around y with radius 2^{-n} * δ/(1 + δ) is contained in π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)). Therefore, π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)) is open in the metric topology. Thus, each subbasic set of the product topology is open in the metric topology, implying that the product topology is coarser than the metric topology. Combined with part (i), which shows that the metric topology is coarser than the product topology, they are equal.\n\nBut the user's approach for (ii) was to write π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)) as a union of finite intersections of balls in (X, d). But perhaps each π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)) is already a union of metric balls. For example, for each y in π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)), we can find a metric ball around y contained in π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)), as above. Therefore, π_n^{-1}(B(x_n, ε)) is the union of all such balls, hence open in the metric topology. Then, since finite intersections of subbasic sets (which are π_n^{-1}(U_n)) form a basis for the product topology, and each subbasic set is open in the metric topology, so all basic open sets in product topology are open in metric topology. Hence, product topology is coarser than metric topology.\n\nSo, the user might have intended to use (i) and (ii) to conclude the topologies are the same. Therefore, structuring the problem, the assumptions are:\n\nEach (X_n, d_n) is a metric space.\n\nX is the product space of X_n.\n\nd is defined as the sum given.\n\nThe problem is to show that d generates the product topology, i.e., the metric topology induced by d coincides with the product topology.\n\nBut the user already split it into (i) and (ii). So, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be the given structures: X_n are metric spaces, X is the product, d is defined as such. Then the problem is to show that d generates the product topology.\n\nBut according to the example provided, assumptions are conditions on the objects. So in the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each n, (X_n, d_n) is a metric space.\n\n- X is the product space X = ∏_{n=1}^∞ X_n.\n\n- The function d is defined as d(x,y) = sum_{n=1}^∞ 2^{-n} [d_n(x_n,y_n)/(1 + d_n(x_n,y_n))].\n\nProblem: Show that d is a metric on X which generates the product topology.\n\nBut the user mentions that they already showed d is a metric, so the problem is just to show it generates the product topology. Hence, the assumptions are the given structures, and the problem is the second part.",
