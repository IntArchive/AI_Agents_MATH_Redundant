    "Content": "Show that $$\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: |z^2+1|\\le 2 \\} \\subseteq \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z^3+3z+2|\\le 6 \\} \\tag{*}$$ (In other words: Let $z\\in \\mathbb{C}$ satisfy $|z^2+1|\\le 2$ . Prove that $|z^3+3z+2|\\le 6.$ ) This problem was asked by mengdie1982 roughly a day ago(relative to posting this question), but was closed due to lack of work. This has been bothering me because of how simply it has been stated, however even after hours of work I am not close to proving this mathematically. Geometrically the statement (*) is true, as seen below. $\\hspace{4cm}$ Here are some estimates: From reverse triangle inequality, $|z^2+1| \\le 2$ implies $|z| \\le \\sqrt{3}$ with equality at $z=i\\sqrt{3}$ . From triangle inequality, $|z^3+3z+2| \\le |z|^3+3|z|+2 \\le 6\\sqrt{3}+2 \\approx 12.4$ . A better bound can also be achieved by factorization, $$|z^3+3z+2| = |z(z^2+1)+2(z+1)| \\le |z||z^2+1|+2(|z|+1) \\le 4\\sqrt{3}+2 \\approx 8.93. $$ Another approach I took was to show that for any $r<6$ , $$\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: |z^2+1|\\le 2 \\} \\nsubseteq \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z^3+3z+2|\\le r \\}  $$ which explains the pinching behavior between the sets near the point $(1,0)$ . Define $$L=\\left(\\frac{2}{2-r+\\sqrt{8-4r+r^{2}}}\\right)^{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)},\\quad  z_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+L-\\frac{1}{L}\\right), $$ then with much effort, it can be shown that $z_0$ satisfies $|z^2+1|\\le 2$ , but it is not present in the other set. This implies that (*) can be reworded as  finding the largest $r>0$ such that $$\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: |z^2+1|\\le r \\} \\subseteq \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z^3+3z+2|\\le 6 \\}$$ or it is possible that there is an easier solution which I am missing.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proof. Let $z = a + \\mathrm{i} b$ . It suffices to prove that $$(a^3-3ab^2+3a+2)^2 + (3a^2b-b^3+3b)^2 \\le 36$$ for all real numbers $a, b$ with $(a^2-b^2+1)^2 + 4a^2b^2 \\le 4$ . We have the following identity \\begin{align*}\n\t&36-(a^3-3ab^2+3a+2)^2-(3a^2b-b^3+3b)^2\\\\\n\t={}& (8a^2+b^2+1)\\Big(4-(a^2-b^2+1)^2-4a^2b^2\\Big)\\\\\n\t&\\qquad +\n\t\\frac17(7a^3 + 7ab^2 - 13a + 6)^2 + \\frac15(7a^2 + 5b^2 - 7)^2\\\\\n\t&\\qquad + \\frac{8}{85}(17a + 12)^2(a - 1)^2 + \\frac{60}{119}(a - 1)^2.\n\\end{align*} We are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is to show that if a complex number z satisfies |z² + 1| ≤ 2, then it must also satisfy |z³ + 3z + 2| ≤ 6. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states z is a complex number (z ∈ ℂ) and that |z² + 1| ≤ 2. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- z is a complex number.\n- |z² + 1| ≤ 2.\n\nThe problem part is to prove that |z³ + 3z + 2| ≤ 6 under these conditions. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were split into two lines: one about n being an integer and another about divisibility by 7. Similarly here, the two conditions are z being complex and the inequality. So I need to structure it accordingly.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention any other constraints on z beyond being complex and satisfying the inequality. The user mentioned that the question was closed due to lack of work, but the user provided some attempts like using triangle inequality and factorization. However, those are part of the question's context, not the problem's assumptions. So the formatted problem should only include the given conditions, not the solution attempts.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have two assumptions: z is a complex number, and |z² + 1| ≤ 2. The problem is to prove that |z³ + 3z + 2| ≤ 6.",
