    "Content": "Show that there's a unique minimum spanning tree (MST) in case the edges' weights are pairwise different $(w(e)\\neq w(f) \\text{ for } e\\neq f)$. I thought that the proof can be done for example by contradiction, saying that we have $2$ different MST meaning that somewhere was possible to pick from more edges, so $w(e) = w(f)$ for $e\\neq f$, contradiction. Apparently this is not correct. How would you show that a graph has a unique MST if all edges have distinct weights?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are distinct minimum spanning trees, then consider the edge of minimum weight among all the edges that are contained in exactly one of $T_1$ or $T_2$. Without loss of generality, this edge appears only in $T_1$, and we can call it $e_1$. Then $T_2 \\cup \\{ e_1 \\}$ must contain a cycle, and one of the edges of this cycle, call it $e_2$, is not in $T_1$. Since $e_2$ is a edge different from $e_1$ and is contained in exactly one of $T_1$ or $T_2$, it must be that $w ( e_1 ) < w ( e_2 )$. Note that $T = T_2 \\cup \\{ e_1 \\} \\setminus \\{ e_2 \\}$ is a spanning tree. The total weight of $T$ is smaller than the total weight of $T_2$, but this is a contradiction, since we have supposed that $T_2$ is a minimum spanning tree.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the task is to show that if all the edge weights in a graph are distinct, then there's a unique minimum spanning tree (MST). I remember that MSTs are spanning trees with the minimum possible total edge weight. The usual algorithms like Krusky's or Prim's come to mind, which greedily add the smallest edges without forming cycles. \n\nThe user mentioned trying a proof by contradiction: assuming there are two different MSTs, then there must be some edges where the weights are equal, leading to a contradiction since all edges are supposed to have distinct weights. But the user said this approach wasn't correct. Hmm, why might that be? Maybe because even with distinct weights, two different MSTs could somehow have the same total weight by combining different edges with different weights. Wait, but if all edges have distinct weights, then each edge has a unique position in the sorted order. \n\nLet me recall the Cut Property and Cycle Property of MSTs. The Cut Property says that the smallest edge across any cut must be included in the MST. The Cycle Property states that the largest edge in any cycle of the graph is not part of the MST. \n\nSince all edge weights are distinct, every cut will have a unique smallest edge. Therefore, the MST must include that unique smallest edge for every possible cut. Similarly, in any cycle, the largest edge is uniquely determined and must be excluded. This suggests that the MST is uniquely determined because at every step of building the MST, the choice of edge is forced. \n\nAlternatively, think about Kruskal's algorithm. If all edges have distinct weights, the algorithm has no ambiguity in choosing the next edge to add; it always picks the smallest available edge that doesn't form a cycle. Since the order is fixed, the resulting MST must be unique. The same logic applies to Prim's algorithm, where each step adds the smallest edge connecting the current tree to a new vertex, and there's only one choice each time because all weights are distinct. \n\nSo, the key idea is that with distinct weights, every decision in the MST construction is forced, leaving no room for alternative choices, which would be necessary to form a different MST. Therefore, assuming there are two MSTs would imply that at some point, there was a tie in edge selection, which contradicts the distinct weights. \n\nWait, but the user tried a contradiction approach and was told it's not correct. Maybe their specific contradiction argument was flawed, not the entire approach. Let me formalize the proof properly. \n\nSuppose there are two distinct MSTs, T1 and T2. Since they're different, there must be at least one edge in T1 that's not in T2. Let’s consider the edge with the smallest weight that is in T1 but not in T2. Call this edge e. When we add e to T2, it creates a cycle. Since T2 is an MST, all other edges in this cycle must have weights less than e (by the Cycle Property). But in T1, e is part of the MST, so in the cycle formed by adding e to T2, there must be another edge f which is in T2 but not in T1. However, since all edge weights are distinct, the weight of f must be less than e. But then, when building T1, if f was considered, it would have been added instead of e, unless adding f would create a cycle in T1. But T1 is a tree, so adding f would create a cycle only if f was already in T1. But f isn't in T1, so this leads to a contradiction. Hence, there can't be two distinct MSTs. \n\nThis seems like a valid argument. The contradiction arises because assuming two MSTs leads to an edge in one MST being replaceable by a smaller edge from the other, contradicting the minimality or the distinctness of weights.",
