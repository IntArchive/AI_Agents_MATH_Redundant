    "Content": "Question is to prove that : $Q_8$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_8$ , but not isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$ for $n\\leq 7$ . I see that $Q_8$ is isomorphic to subgroup of $S_8$ by left multiplication action. Hint given was to prove that stabilizer of any point contains $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ . To prove Cayley's theorem, stating any group is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$ we take action of given group on a set $A$ having same cardinality. with that motivation I want to check if there is a Isomorphism then there is a map from $G\\times A \\rightarrow A$ . i.e., $G$ gives a permutation group $S_A$ . I tried in same manner. Suppose $Q_8$ is isomorphic to subgroup of $S_n$ with $n\\leq 7.$ Then it should come from a group action of $Q_8$ on a set of cardinality at most 7. Suppose $Q_8$ acts on a set $A$ with possible cardinality at most 7. For $a \\in A,$ let $\\textrm{Stab}(a)=\\{g\\in Q_8 : g \\cdot a = a\\}$ $\\textrm{cl}(a)=\\{g \\cdot a : g\\in Q_8\\}$ denote the stabilizer of $a$ in $Q_8$ and the class (or orbit) of $a,$ respectively. I know the number of elements in a class of $a$ equals to the index of the stabilizer of $a$ in $Q_8.$ By the definition of class of $a$ , $\\textrm{cl}(a)\\subseteq A$ and as $|A|\\leq 7,$ I see that $|\\textrm{cl}(a)|\\leq 7$ . But, $|\\textrm{cl}(a)|=|Q_8: \\textrm{Stab}(a)|$ for any element $a\\in A$ . So, $|Q_8:\\textrm{Stab}(a)|=|\\textrm{cl}(a)|\\leq 7$ for all $a\\in A$ . So, $\\textrm{Stab}(a)$ should be non-trivial subgroup of $Q_8$ (if not then $|Q_8:\\textrm{Stab}(a)|=8.$ A proper non-trivial subgroup of $Q_8$ contains $\\{\\pm1\\}$ . So, in the worst case, $\\{\\pm 1\\}\\subseteq \\textrm{Stab}(a)$ for all $a\\in A$ . As $\\ker(\\eta)=\\cap_{a\\in A}\\textrm{Stab}(a)$ (where $\\eta$ is the action of $Q_8$ on $A$ ) We see that $\\{\\pm 1\\}\\subseteq \\ker(\\eta)$ which means that $\\ker(\\eta)$ is non-trivial. Thus, there is no isomorphism (coming from $\\eta$ ) between $Q_8$ and any subgroup of $S_7$ . I would be thankful if someone can check whether my approach is correct or if there is any other simple possible way. P.S : Usually what i do to see whether two groups are isomorphic or not is to check for cardinality, abelian property, no of elements with same order and so on. But I was having no idea when i fail in all these ways. With this Group actions i could see possibility for getting a precise conclusion on Isomorphisms.I would like to Thank Mr. Jyrki Lahtonen (a user of Math.SE) who made me to get used to Group actions. P.S $2$ : If any thing is wrong in my idea, it is entirely my fault, and if anything is correct in this whole credit should go to Mr. Jyrki Lahtonen",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof is correct, but one can generalize and shorten it as follows: Let $G$ be a finite group and assume that the intersection of all non-trivial subgroups of $G$ is non-trivial, i.e. contains some $g \\neq 1$. If $G$ acts on a set $A$ with $|A|<|G|$, then for every $a \\in A$ we have $|G:G_a|=|Ga| \\leq |A| < |G|$. Therefore, $G_a$ is non-trivial, and $g \\in \\cap_{a \\in A} G_a = \\ker(G \\to \\mathrm{Sym}(A))$. Hence, $G$ doesn't embed into $\\mathrm{Sym}(A)$. For the Quaternion group we can take $g=-1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. The user wants to prove that the quaternion group Q8 is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group S8 but not to any subgroup of Sn for n ≤ 7. \n\nFirst, the example provided in the original question mentions Cayley's theorem, which states that any group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on G. Since Q8 has 8 elements, Cayley's theorem would embed Q8 into S8, which explains the first part. But why can't it be embedded into a smaller symmetric group like S7 or lower?\n\nThe user's approach involves group actions. They considered the action of Q8 on a set A with |A| ≤ 7. For each element a in A, the stabilizer subgroup Stab(a) must have an index in Q8 that divides 8 (since the orbit-stabilizer theorem tells us |Q8 : Stab(a)| = |cl(a)|). However, since |A| ≤ 7, each orbit's size can't exceed 7, so the index of each stabilizer must be at most 7. This forces the stabilizer to be non-trivial because 8 divided by the index gives the order of the stabilizer. If the index were 8, the stabilizer would be trivial, but since the index must be ≤7, the stabilizer must have at least 2 elements.\n\nNow, all non-trivial subgroups of Q8 contain the subgroup {±1}. Therefore, the intersection of all stabilizers (the kernel of the action) must contain {±1}. Hence, the action isn't faithful because the kernel isn't trivial. A faithful action is required for an embedding into the symmetric group, so Q8 can't embed into Sn for n ≤7.\n\nWait, but the user mentions \"non-trivial subgroup of Q8 contains {±1}\". Let me verify Q8's subgroup structure. The quaternion group Q8 has order 8, with elements {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}. Its subgroups are: the trivial subgroup, {±1}, ⟨i⟩, ⟨j⟩, ⟨k⟩, and the entire group. So indeed, every non-trivial subgroup contains {±1}, since the cyclic subgroups of order 4 (⟨i⟩, etc.) all include -1. Therefore, the intersection of all stabilizers, which is the kernel, contains {±1}, making the kernel non-trivial. Therefore, the homomorphism from Q8 to S_n can't be injective, so there's no embedding into S_n for n ≤7.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. Q8 is a group of order 8 (quaternion group).\n2. The problem considers group actions of Q8 on a set A with |A| ≤7.\n3. For each a in A, the stabilizer Stab(a) is a subgroup of Q8.\n4. The orbit-stabilizer theorem applies, so |cl(a)| = |Q8 : Stab(a)|.\n5. The size of each orbit |cl(a)| ≤7 because |A| ≤7.\n6. Therefore, the index |Q8 : Stab(a)| divides 8 and is ≤7, implying Stab(a) is non-trivial.\n7. All non-trivial subgroups of Q8 contain {±1}.\n8. The kernel of the action is the intersection of all Stab(a), which contains {±1}, hence non-trivial.\n9. A faithful action requires trivial kernel, so no faithful action exists on a set of size ≤7, hence no embedding into S_n for n ≤7.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that Q8 is isomorphic to a subgroup of S8 but not to any subgroup of S_n for n ≤7. The assumptions needed are about Q8's structure, the group action's properties, and the consequences on the kernel. The example given by the user seems correct, but the key points are:\n\n- The orbit-stabilizer theorem's application.\n- The structure of Q8's subgroups.\n- The kernel being non-trivial, making the action non-faithful.\n\nSo formatting the problem as per the user's request, the assumptions should list each key point as separate lines, addressing one property each. Then the problem statement as given.",
