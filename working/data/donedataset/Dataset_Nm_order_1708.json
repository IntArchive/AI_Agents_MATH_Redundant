    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this trigonometric identity proof. The user is trying to prove that (cos x)/(1 - sin x) - tan x equals sec x. Their attempt seems to have gone off track, so I need to figure out where they went wrong and how to guide them correctly.\n\nFirst, let me recall the original problem: Prove that [cos x/(1 - sin x)] - tan x = sec x. The user's approach started by manipulating the left-hand side. Let me parse their steps step by step.\n\nThey wrote:\ncos x / (1 - sin²x) = cos x / cos²x = 1/cos x = sec x = (sec x + tan x)(1 + sin x)\nThen they expanded that to get sec x = sec x + sec x sin x + tan x + tan x sin x\nSubtracting sec x from both sides gives 0 = tan x + tan x + tan x sin x, which doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, looking at their first step, they transformed the denominator from (1 - sin x) to (1 - sin²x). Wait, that's a mistake. The original denominator is (1 - sin x), not (1 - sin²x). So they incorrectly replaced (1 - sin x) with (1 - sin²x), which is a different expression. That error probably led them down the wrong path.\n\nSo the user's first mistake was altering the denominator incorrectly. Let me correct that. The left-hand side of the identity is [cos x/(1 - sin x)] - tan x. The user's first step should not involve changing (1 - sin x) to (1 - sin²x). Instead, maybe they intended to multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sin x) to rationalize the denominator. That's a common technique in trigonometric identities to eliminate the denominator. Let's explore that approach.\n\nStarting fresh, let's take [cos x/(1 - sin x)] - tan x. Let me handle each term separately. The first term is cos x over (1 - sin x). If I multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sin x), which is the conjugate of the denominator, that would give:\n\n[cos x (1 + sin x)] / [(1 - sin x)(1 + sin x)] = [cos x (1 + sin x)] / (1 - sin²x) = [cos x (1 + sin x)] / cos²x, since 1 - sin²x is cos²x.\n\nSimplifying that, the cos x in the numerator cancels with one cos x in the denominator, leaving (1 + sin x)/cos x. So the first term simplifies to (1 + sin x)/cos x.\n\nNow the original expression becomes [(1 + sin x)/cos x] - tan x. Since tan x is sin x / cos x, substituting that in gives:\n\n(1 + sin x)/cos x - sin x / cos x = [1 + sin x - sin x]/cos x = 1/cos x = sec x, which matches the right-hand side. Therefore, the identity holds.\n\nBut the user's approach had an error in the denominator. Instead of keeping (1 - sin x), they changed it to (1 - sin²x), which is only valid if they multiplied numerator and denominator by (1 + sin x). However, in their steps, they didn't show that multiplication, leading to an incorrect manipulation. Then, when they tried to equate it to (sec x + tan x)(1 + sin x), that part is unclear. Perhaps they tried to factor or expand something incorrectly.\n\nAnother possible approach is to start with the left-hand side and combine the terms step by step. Let's verify again:\n\nLeft-hand side: [cos x/(1 - sin x)] - tan x.\n\nFirst, express tan x as sin x / cos x. Then, we have:\n\n[cos x/(1 - sin x)] - [sin x / cos x]\n\nTo combine these two terms into a single fraction, find a common denominator. The denominators are (1 - sin x) and cos x, so the common denominator would be cos x(1 - sin x). Rewriting each term:\n\nFirst term: [cos x * cos x] / [cos x(1 - sin x)] = cos²x / [cos x(1 - sin x)]\n\nSecond term: [sin x (1 - sin x)] / [cos x(1 - sin x)]\n\nSubtracting these gives [cos²x - sin x (1 - sin x)] / [cos x(1 - sin x)]\n\nExpand the numerator: cos²x - sin x + sin²x.\n\nBut cos²x + sin²x = 1, so this becomes 1 - sin x.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is 1 - sin x, and the denominator is cos x(1 - sin x). The (1 - sin x) terms cancel, leaving 1 / cos x = sec x, which is the right-hand side.\n\nSo the correct steps involve either rationalizing the denominator first or combining the fractions directly. The user's mistake was incorrectly altering the denominator without properly applying the conjugate multiplication, leading to an invalid expression.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the required format. The original problem is to prove the identity, but the assumptions here would be the trigonometric identities used and the domains where the identity holds. However, the user didn't specify any particular constraints. But in trigonometric identities, certain expressions are defined only when denominators aren't zero. So the assumptions would involve the values of x where the expressions are defined.\n\nFor example, the denominator 1 - sin x cannot be zero, so sin x ≠ 1, which implies x ≠ π/2 + 2πk for integers k. Similarly, tan x is defined where cos x ≠ 0, so x ≠ π/2 + πk. Also, sec x is defined where cos x ≠ 0. So the assumptions are about the domain of x where all expressions are valid.\n\nBut the problem as stated just asks to prove the identity, so the main assumption is that x is in the domain where all terms are defined. The problem is straightforward: prove the given trigonometric identity.",
