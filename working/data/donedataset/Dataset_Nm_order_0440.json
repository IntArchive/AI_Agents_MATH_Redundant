    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is one of the cutest applications of AM-GM I have learned. Unfortunately, I do not remember the source. Define the numbers $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ by:\n$$\nx_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, &i = 0,\n\\\\\\\\ 1+\\frac{1}{n}, &1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n. \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe claim follows by applying AM-GM:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{x_0 + x_1 + \\ldots + x_n}{n+1} \\right)^{n+1} \\gt \\ \\prod_{i=0}^n \\, x_i .\n$$\nPlugging in the above values, we get \n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1+n \\Big(1+\\frac{1}{n} \\Big)}{n+1} \\right)^{n+1} \\gt \\  1 \\cdot \\left( 1+\\frac{1}{n} \\right)^n ,\n$$\nwhich simplifies to \n$$\n\\left( 1+ \\frac{1}{n+1} \\right)^{n+1} \\gt \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^n.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that the inequality (1 + 1/(n+1))^{n+1} > (1 + 1/n)^n holds for n in the natural numbers. They mentioned possibly using AM-GM but aren't sure how.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The problem states that n is a natural number. The original problem didn't specify any additional constraints, so the main assumption is that n is in the set of natural numbers. Wait, but natural numbers usually start at 1, right? So the assumption is n is a natural number, so n ≥ 1. But the problem statement just says n ∈ ℕ. So I need to note that as the assumption.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove the inequality. The example given in the user's instruction had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. In this case, there's only one assumption: n is a natural number. So the formatted problem should have that as the assumption and then the problem statement.\n\nWait, the example had an original problem where the formatted version included an assumption that wasn't explicitly in the original. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, but in this current problem, the original question doesn't have any hidden assumptions. The user is just asking to prove the inequality for n ∈ ℕ. So I shouldn't add any extra assumptions. The only assumption here is that n is a natural number. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that as the assumption.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user might have made a mistake. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, I should follow the current problem correctly.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the only assumption is n is a natural number. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$ \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} \\gt \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n} \\right)^{n} $$ where $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nWait, the problem statement already includes \"where n ∈ ℕ\", so maybe the assumption is redundant? But according to the example, even if the original problem mentions the condition, it's listed in the assumption. So perhaps the assumption is to list that n is a natural number. So I should include that as the assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$ \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} \\gt \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n} \\right)^{n} $$.\n\nI think that's correct. The example had a case where an additional assumption was added, but in this case, there's no such hidden condition. So the only assumption is n ∈ ℕ. The problem is to prove the inequality.",
