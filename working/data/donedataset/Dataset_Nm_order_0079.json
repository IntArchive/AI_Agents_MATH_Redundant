    "Content": "I've just started to learn about the tensor product and I want to show: $$(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} (\\mathbb{Z} / n \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/ \\gcd(m,n)\\mathbb{Z}.$$ Can you tell me if my proof is right: $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z} / n \\mathbb{Z}$ are both finite free $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules with the basis consisting of one single element $\\{ 1 \\}$. So $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} (\\mathbb{Z} / n \\mathbb{Z})$ has the basis $\\{ 1 \\otimes 1 \\}$. Therefore, any element in $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} (\\mathbb{Z} / n \\mathbb{Z})$  is of the form $(ab) 1 \\otimes 1$ and any element in $\\mathbb{Z}/ \\gcd(m,n)\\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $k 1 = k$ where $k \\in \\{ 0, \\dots , \\gcd(n,m) \\}$. I would like to construct an isomorphism that maps $ab$ to some $k$. Let this map be $ab (1 \\otimes 1) \\mapsto ab \\bmod \\gcd(n,m)$. This is a homomorphism between modules: it maps $0$ to $0$ because it maps the empty sum to the empty sum. It also fulfills $f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)$ because there is only one element, $a = 1$. It is surjective. So all I need to show is that it is injective. But that is clear too because if $ab \\equiv 0 \\bmod \\gcd(m,n)$  then both $a \\equiv 0 \\bmod n$ and $b \\equiv 0 \\bmod m$ so the kernel is trivial. Many thanks for your help!!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The part that is missing is pretty much the essence of the following (incomplete) alternative proof. Determine the kernel of $$\n  \\begin{array}{rlrl}\n    g: & \\mathbb{Z} & \\rightarrow & (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} (\\mathbb{Z} / n \\mathbb{Z})\n    \\\\\n       & z          & \\to         & z (1 \\otimes 1)\n  \\end{array}\n$$ That is: When is it true that $z (1 \\otimes 1)$ is null? Since it is true for $z \\in m\\mathbb{Z} \\cup n\\mathbb{Z}$ , then you know that it is true for the ideal generated by it: $\\langle \\mathrm{gcd}(m,n)\\rangle \\subset \\mathrm{ker}(g)$ . You know that the map is surjective because $1 \\otimes 1$ is a generator. If you show that $\\mathrm{ker}(g) \\subset \\langle \\mathrm{gcd}(m,n) \\rangle$ , you will have the isomorphism you claim. This is the part you are missing. It is equivalent to showing that your $f$ is well-defined. So, the conclusion is that it is not right.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem as per the given format. The original question is about proving that the tensor product of Z/mZ and Z/nZ over Z is isomorphic to Z/gcd(m,n)Z. The user provided their own proof and is asking if it's correct. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem involves tensor products of two Z-modules: Z/mZ and Z/nZ. The key assumptions here are the structures of these modules. \n\nEach assumption should address one property or condition of a single object. So, the first assumption is that we're considering the tensor product of Z/mZ and Z/nZ as Z-modules. The second assumption is that the tensor product is taken over the ring Z. Another assumption is that m and n are integers, which is implicit since we're dealing with Z/mZ and Z/nZ. However, the user doesn't specify any restrictions on m and n, like being positive or non-zero. But in the context of tensor products, m and n are typically positive integers. Wait, the original problem doesn't state that m and n are positive, but in modular arithmetic, they usually are. Should I include that as an assumption? The problem as stated might not mention it, so maybe I shouldn't add extra assumptions unless specified.\n\nLooking back at the example given, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. The user here didn't specify any conditions on m and n beyond being used in Z/mZ and Z/nZ. So perhaps the assumptions are just that we're working with these modules over Z. But maybe the key properties here are that Z/mZ and Z/nZ are Z-modules, and the tensor product is over Z. \n\nWait, the user's proof attempt mentions that Z/mZ and Z/nZ are finite free Z-modules. But that's incorrect because Z/mZ is not a free Z-module unless m=0. So maybe that's part of the problem, but the user is mistaken. However, for the assumptions, we need to state the actual conditions of the problem, not the user's incorrect claims. The actual problem is to show the isomorphism, so the assumptions should include that m and n are integers (probably positive), and we're taking the tensor product over Z of Z/mZ and Z/nZ. \n\nBut how to phrase each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe problem considers the tensor product of ℤ/mℤ and ℤ/nℤ as ℤ-modules.\nThe tensor product is taken over the ring ℤ.\nm and n are integers.\nℤ/mℤ and ℤ/nℤ are ℤ-modules.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show the isomorphism. The original problem doesn't specify any additional constraints on m and n, so maybe the assumptions are just that m and n are integers (possibly positive, but not stated). However, in standard contexts, m and n would be positive integers. Should that be included? The problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange doesn't mention positivity, so perhaps it's safer not to assume unless specified. The user's proof attempt is incorrect in assuming they are free modules, but the actual problem doesn't have that as an assumption. So the correct assumptions would be:\n\n- The tensor product is of ℤ/mℤ and ℤ/nℤ over ℤ.\n- m and n are integers (implicitly non-zero to form the quotient modules).\n\nBut to list each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first module is ℤ/mℤ.\nThe second module is ℤ/nℤ.\nThe tensor product is taken over ℤ.\nm and n are integers.\n\nBut maybe each line is one assumption for one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ/mℤ is a ℤ-module.\nℤ/nℤ is a ℤ-module.\nThe tensor product is over ℤ.\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\n\nBut the problem is to show the isomorphism. The problem's assumptions are just the given modules and the tensor product over ℤ. The problem doesn't impose conditions on m and n beyond their use in defining the modules. However, in practice, m and n are positive integers, but since the user didn't specify, maybe we shouldn't add that. The example given in the original had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the problem doesn't state such conditions, so the assumptions should be only what's necessary. Maybe just:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ/mℤ and ℤ/nℤ are ℤ-modules.\nThe tensor product is over the ring ℤ.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ/mℤ is a ℤ-module.\nℤ/nℤ is a ℤ-module.\nThe tensor product is constructed over ℤ.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first factor in the tensor product is ℤ/mℤ.\nThe second factor in the tensor product is ℤ/nℤ.\nThe ring over which the tensor product is taken is ℤ.\nm and n are integers.\n\nBut the problem as stated is to show the isomorphism. So the key elements are the two modules, the ring over which the tensor is taken, and m and n being integers. So each line:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ/mℤ is a ℤ-module.\nℤ/nℤ is a ℤ-module.\nThe tensor product is over ℤ.\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\n\nBut perhaps m and n are positive integers? The problem doesn't specify, but in the context of quotient modules, m and n are typically positive. However, since it's not stated, maybe we shouldn't assume. The user might have m and n as any integers, but quotient modules are usually for positive integers. But unless specified, we can't include that. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe problem involves the tensor product of ℤ/mℤ and ℤ/nℤ.\nThe tensor product is taken over ℤ.\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\n\nBut each line should address one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nℤ/mℤ is a ℤ-module.\nℤ/nℤ is a ℤ-module.\nThe tensor product is over the ring ℤ.\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state m and n are integers, but they are implied because we have ℤ/mℤ and ℤ/nℤ. However, in the example given, the assumption was that n is an integer. So following that, we should list m and n as integers. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\nℤ/mℤ is a ℤ-module.\nℤ/nℤ is a ℤ-module.\nThe tensor product is over ℤ.\n\nBut wait, the tensor product is over ℤ, which is part of the problem's structure, so that's another assumption. So each line:\n\n- m is an integer.\n- n is an integer.\n- ℤ/mℤ is a ℤ-module.\n- ℤ/nℤ is a ℤ-module.\n- The tensor product is taken over the ring ℤ.\n\nBut maybe \"The tensor product is taken over ℤ.\" is the key part. The modules are given. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFirst module: ℤ/mℤ.\nSecond module: ℤ/nℤ.\nTensor product is over ℤ.\nm and n are integers.\n\nBut the example used separate lines for each. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\nThe first module is ℤ/mℤ.\nThe second module is ℤ/nℤ.\nThe tensor product is taken over ℤ.\n\nYes, that seems better. Each line addresses one object or condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\nThe first module in the tensor product is ℤ/mℤ.\nThe second module in the tensor product is ℤ/nℤ.\nThe ring over which the tensor product is taken is ℤ.\n\nBut maybe even simpler, since the problem is about the tensor product of these two modules over ℤ. So:\n\nAssumption:\nm and n are integers.\nThe problem considers the tensor product of ℤ/mℤ and ℤ/nℤ over ℤ.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be line by line, each addressing one property. So splitting:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\nThe tensor product involves ℤ/mℤ.\nThe tensor product involves ℤ/nℤ.\nThe tensor product is taken over ℤ.\n\nThat's five lines. But perhaps more accurately:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first module in the tensor product is ℤ/mℤ.\nThe second module in the tensor product is ℤ/nℤ.\nThe tensor product is over the ring ℤ.\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\n\nYes, that's five lines, each addressing one condition or object.\n\nThen the problem is to show that this tensor product is isomorphic to ℤ/gcd(m,n)ℤ.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first module in the tensor product is ℤ/mℤ.\nThe second module in the tensor product is ℤ/nℤ.\nThe tensor product is over the ring ℤ.\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\nProblem:\nShow that $$(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} (\\mathbb{Z} / n \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/ \\gcd(m,n)\\mathbb{Z}.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". But in that case, maybe the user added an extra assumption. Wait, no. The original example's problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe the example was incorrectly formatted. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should be \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That must be a mistake. Perhaps the example is wrong. But the user says \"Example: Original problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number [...] is divisible by 91. Formatted problem: assumption: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by $7$.\" So that's a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the user wants us to filter out unrelated information and list the actual assumptions. In the example, the user added an incorrect assumption, but perhaps in reality, the correct assumptions for that problem should be just \"n is an integer\", but they added an extra assumption. So perhaps in our current problem, we should not include any extra assumptions beyond what is necessary. So for the tensor product problem, the assumptions are simply that we are dealing with those modules over Z, and m and n are integers. So:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer.\nn is an integer.\nThe tensor product is of ℤ/mℤ and ℤ/nℤ over ℤ.\n\nBut according to the example's structure, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, here we should list m and n as integers, and the modules involved. Each assumption line by line.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nm is an integer,\nn is an integer,\nThe first module is ℤ/mℤ,\nThe second module is ℤ/nℤ,\nThe tensor product is over the ring ℤ.\nProblem: \nShow that $$(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} (\\mathbb{Z} / n \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/ \\gcd(m,n)\\mathbb{Z}.$$\n###",
