    "Content": "I am solving question $8$ of exercises in section 1.1. of chapter 1 in \"Topology without tears\". The question reads as follows. Let $X$ be an infinite set and $\\tau$ be a topology on $X$. If every infinite subset of $X$ is in $\\tau$, prove that $\\tau$ is the discrete topology My idea was to show that every singleton set is in the topology and thereby the topology is discrete. Choose an infinite set $A$ from $X$ such that $A^c$ is also infinite. $A$ and $A^c$ belong to $\\tau$ since they are infinite sets. Now consider any $x \\in X$. Note that $A \\cup \\{x\\}$ and $A^c \\cup \\{x\\}$ belong to $\\tau$ since they are infinite sets. Hence, their intersection which is nothing but $\\{x\\} \\in \\tau$ for every $x \\in X$. The problem I have is I don't know how to prove the first sentence in the previous paragraph. These are my line of thoughts to prove them. If $X$ is a countably infinite set, then I can list the elements are let the odd numbered elements fall into $A$. This guarantees $A$ and $A^c$ are both infinite. If $X$ is uncountable, then I can choose a countably infinite subset and call it $A$. Are the above arguments rigorous? I am not especially happy with my second argument of choosing a countably infinite subset from an uncountable set since I do not give an explicit procedure of constructing the set $A$. Also, is there any other simpler way of answering the original question?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The argument is perfect, and Arturo already has explained you that if you use the (countable) axiom of choice you can always ensure that there is such a set $A$. Also, your reasoning for the existence of such a set $A$ is correct when formalized in ZFC, using the axiom of choice (but of course, in the second case, you must show using AC that every uncountable set has a countably infinite subset). Let me note here that what you have done is the best possible, that is, there is no way to get rid of AC, and moreover that in order to prove it, you must have a subset A of X such that both $A$ and $A^c$ are infinite. It's consistent with ZF that there exists an amorphous set X (that is, an infinite set X such that for every subset $A\\subseteq X$ either $A$ or $X-A$ is finite). Then you can have a topology over X such that all infinite subsets of X are open, but the topology is not the discrete topology. Let $\\tau$ be the topology on X consisting exactly of the infinite subsets of X, toghether with the empty set. Let's see that this is a topology. Indeed, $X$ and $\\emptyset$ are in $\\tau$ by definition (since X is infinite), and union of open sets is open, for the union of an infinite set with anything else is also infinite. Suppose now that A and B are infinite subsets of X. Suppose $A \\cap B$ is finite. Then $X-(A \\cap B) = (X-A) \\cup (X-B)$ must be infinite, since X is infinite. But since X is amorphous and $A$,$B$ are infinite, both $X-A$ and $X-B$ are finite, hence $(X-A)\\cup(X-B)$ must also be finite, a contradiction. Thus if $A,B$ are infinite so is $A \\cap B$ and this proves that intersection of two open sets is open. Then, (X,$\\tau$) is a topological space with all infinite subsets of X open, yet no finite subset of X open (except the empty set), and in particular not discrete.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to format the given problem into the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is from Topology without tears, chapter 1, section 1.1, question 8. The question states: Let X be an infinite set with a topology τ. If every infinite subset of X is in τ, prove that τ is the discrete topology. The user's approach was to show that every singleton set is in τ, which would imply the topology is discrete. They considered splitting X into two infinite subsets A and A^c, then using their unions with a singleton {x} and intersecting those to get {x} in τ. However, they're concerned about the rigor of their method to ensure both A and A^c are infinite, especially when X is uncountable.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states:\n\n1. X is an infinite set.\n2. τ is a topology on X.\n3. Every infinite subset of X is in τ.\n\nThe goal is to prove τ is the discrete topology. The user's method involves showing singletons are open. So in the assumptions, I need to list each condition applied to one object. Let me check:\n\nAssumption 1: X is an infinite set. (Applies to X)\nAssumption 2: τ is a topology on X. (Applies to τ)\nAssumption 3: Every infinite subset of X is in τ. (Applies to subsets of X and their membership in τ)\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. So the formatted problem should list these three assumptions. Then the problem statement is to prove τ is discrete.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"prove that τ is the discrete topology\". The user's approach is valid, but the key step is ensuring singletons are open. To get there, they need to split X into two infinite subsets whose complements are also infinite. The user is questioning whether their argument for choosing such subsets is rigorous, especially in the uncountable case.\n\nBut for formatting the problem as per instructions, we don't need to include the user's doubts or their method, just the original problem's assumptions and the problem statement. So the original problem's assumptions are:\n\n- X is infinite.\n- τ is a topology on X.\n- Every infinite subset of X is in τ.\n\nProblem: Prove τ is the discrete topology.\n\nSo I need to structure that into the Assumption and Problem sections. Let me check the example provided. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the original problem's assumptions are X is infinite, τ is a topology on X, every infinite subset is in τ. So each of these should be separate lines under Assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is an infinite set,\nτ is a topology on X,\nEvery infinite subset of X belongs to τ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that τ is the discrete topology.\n\nThat's the core of it. The user's own thoughts about splitting X into A and A^c with both infinite are part of their solution attempt, but the problem as stated doesn't require those steps to be included in the assumptions. The problem's given conditions are only the three I listed. The user's concern about the rigor of their method isn't part of the problem's assumptions, so they don't need to be included here.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me check each line:\n\n1. X is an infinite set. (Applies to X)\n2. τ is a topology on X. (Applies to τ)\n3. Every infinite subset of X belongs to τ. (Applies to infinite subsets of X and their membership in τ)\n\nYes, each line addresses one condition for one object. Therefore, the formatted problem should look like that.",
