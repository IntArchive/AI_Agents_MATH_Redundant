    "Content": "Inspired by some of the greats on this site, I've been trying to improve my residue skills. I've come across the integral $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^n - 2x + 1}{x^{2n} - 1} \\mathrm{d}x=0$$ where $n$ is a positive integer that is at least $2$ .\nWith non-complex methods, I know that the integral is $0$ . But I know that it can be done with residue theorem. The trouble comes in choosing a contour. We're probably going to do some pie-slice contour, perhaps small enough to avoid any of the $2n$ th roots of unity, and it's clear that the outer-circle vanishes. But I'm having trouble getting the cancellation for the integral. Can you help? (Also, do you have a book reference for collections of calculations of integrals with the residue theorem that might have similar examples?)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We want to prove that the integral is $0$ for $n>1$, it is the same thing as \n$$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{x^n+1} = 2\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x-1}{x^{2n}-1} \\ \\mathrm{d}x.$$\nThe left hand integral is widely known to be $\\frac{\\pi}{n} \\csc \\frac{\\pi}{n}$, we want to calculate the right hand integral. let $f(x)=\\frac{x-1}{x^{2n}-1}$, and consider the contour $C=C_1\\cup C_2\\cup C_3$ where $$C_1=[0,r],\\ C_2=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} | |z|=r,\\ \\arg(z) \\in \\left[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2n}\\right]\\right\\},\\ \\ C_3 =e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{2n}} C_1. $$\nHere's what the contour look like Notice that $\\int_C f(z) \\ \\mathrm{d}z=0$ (the integral is taken counter clockwise always) since $f$ is holomorphic inside $C$. and \n$$\\left|\\int_{C_2} f(x)\\ \\mathrm{d}x \\right| =\\mathcal{O}(r^{-1}) \\to 0.$$\nAnd \n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{C_3}f(z) \\ \\mathrm{d}z &= e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{2n}}\\int_0^r f\\left(x e^{\\frac{\\pi i }{2n}}\\right) \\ \\mathrm{d}x \\\\ \n&=e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{2n}}\\int_0^r \\frac{e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{2n}}x -1}{x^{2n}+1} \\ \\mathrm{d}x \\\\ \n&= e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{n}}\\int_0^r \\frac{x }{x^{2n}+1} \\ \\mathrm{d}x-e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{2n}}\\int_0^r \\frac{1}{x^{2n}+1} \\ \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\end{align*}\nNote that $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x}{x^{2n}+1} \\ \\mathrm{d}x  = \\frac{\\pi }{2n} \\csc \\frac{\\pi}{n}$, then by taking $r\\to \\infty$ we get \n$$\\int_0^{\\infty} f(x) \\  \\mathrm{d}x =-e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{n}}\\cdot \\frac{\\pi }{2n} \\csc \\frac{\\pi}{n} + e^{\\frac{\\pi i}{2n}} \\frac{\\pi }{2n} \\csc \\frac{\\pi}{2n} = \\frac{\\pi}{2n} \\csc \\frac{\\pi}{n}.$$ \nWhich is what we were looking for.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and filter out any unrelated information. The user mentions being inspired by others, trying to improve residue skills, and asking about book references. However, the core problem is the integral given and proving it's zero using the residue theorem. \n\nThe problem states the integral from 0 to infinity of (x^n - 2x + 1)/(x^{2n} - 1) dx equals zero, where n is a positive integer at least 2. The assumptions here would include the conditions on n and the structure of the integrand. The original problem mentions using the residue theorem, but the formatted problem should focus on the mathematical assumptions and the problem statement itself without the methods unless specified.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So, for this integral, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. n is at least 2.\n3. The integrand is (x^n - 2x + 1)/(x^{2n} - 1).\n4. The integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The denominator x^{2n} - 1 factors into (x^n - 1)(x^n + 1), so there are poles at the roots of unity, but the user mentions avoiding them with a contour, which is part of the solving method, not the problem's assumptions. The problem's assumptions should stick to given conditions, not the solution approach.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the assumptions as n being a positive integer, n ≥ 2, and the integral setup. The problem statement is to show that this integral equals zero. The original question mentions using the residue theorem, but the formatted problem might not include the method unless specified. However, in the example given, the assumption included divisibility by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the user wants the problem structured as per the example, focusing on the integral's properties and conditions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n is at least 2.\n- The integral is from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is (x^n - 2x + 1)/(x^{2n} - 1).\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So splitting them:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. n ≥ 2.\n3. The integrand is (x^n - 2x + 1)/(x^{2n} - 1).\n4. The integral is computed over the interval [0, ∞).\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem's assumption about divisibility by 7 was separate. Here, the user specifies that n is a positive integer and that n is at least 2. So each of those is a separate assumption. The integrand is given, and the domain of integration is specified. Therefore, each of these should be separate lines in the assumption list.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nthe integrand is (x^n - 2x + 1)/(x^{2n} - 1),\nthe integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^n - 2x + 1}{x^{2n} - 1} \\mathrm{d}x=0$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem already states that the integral equals zero. The task is to prove it. So the problem statement is to prove the integral equals zero under the given assumptions. The example given had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem to prove divisibility by 91. Here, similarly, the problem is to prove the integral equals zero given the assumptions.\n\nI need to check if the integrand's form is part of the problem or an assumption. Since the problem is to compute the integral of that specific integrand, the integrand's form is part of the problem statement. However, in the example, the function A(n) was part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, perhaps in the formatted problem, the integrand is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Let me re-examine the example.\n\nOriginal example's formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nHere, the function A(n) is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. So similarly, in the current problem, the integrand is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions are only the conditions on n and the domain of integration. Wait, but in the example, the domain (for the integral) is from 0 to infinity, which is part of the problem statement. But in the example given by the user, the problem was about divisibility, so the assumptions were on n. For the integral problem, the domain [0, ∞) is part of the integral's notation, so perhaps it's included in the problem statement. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", both separate. So for the integral problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. n ≥ 2.\n\nThe integral's domain and integrand are part of the problem statement. Wait, but the example includes the function in the problem statement. So perhaps the integrand and integral limits are part of the problem, not the assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions are only about n. Let me check the original problem's title and question:\n\nTitle: Integral ∫_0^∞ (x^n - 2x + 1)/(x^{2n} - 1) dx=0\n\nQuestion: ... the integral ∫_0^∞ (x^n - 2x + 1)/(x^{2n} - 1) dx=0 where n is a positive integer that is at least 2.\n\nSo the problem is to prove the integral equals zero, given that n is a positive integer and n ≥ 2. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n ≥ 2.\n\nThe rest (integrand and limits) are part of the problem statement. Hence, following the example, the formatted problem should list the assumptions about n and then state the problem with the integral.\n\nThus, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn ≥ 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^n - 2x + 1}{x^{2n} - 1} \\mathrm{d}x=0.$$\n\nYes, this seems consistent with the example. The integrand and the integral limits are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. The assumptions are the conditions on n.",
