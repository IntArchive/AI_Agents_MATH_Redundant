    "Content": "I am just checking some properties of the symmetric group and found on Wikipedia the statement that \"Conversely, for $n \\neq 6$ , $S_n$ has no outer automorphisms, and for $n \\neq 2$ it has no center, so for $n \\neq 2, 6$ it is a complete group, as discussed in automorphism group, below.\" I could show that $Z(S_n)=1$ but do you know an easy proof for $\\mathrm{Aut}(S_n)=\\mathrm{Inn}(S_n)$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Lemma . Let $\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ be the automorphism group of a group $G$ and $\\mathrm{cl}(G)$ the conjugacy classes of elements of $G$. Then $\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ acts on $\\mathrm{cl}(G)$. Explanation . Let $\\alpha$ be an automorphism of $G$ and $\\mathrm{cl}(a)=\\{gag^{-1}:g\\in G\\}$ the conjugacy class of $a$. Then $\\alpha(\\mathrm{cl}(a))=\\{\\alpha(g)\\alpha(a)\\alpha(g)^{-1}:g\\in G\\}=\\{t\\alpha(a)t^{-1}:t\\in G\\}=\\mathrm{cl}(\\alpha(a))$ is also a class. Lemma . If $\\alpha\\in\\mathrm{Aut}(S_n)$ stabilizes the conjugacy class of transpositions then $\\alpha\\in\\mathrm{Inn}(S_n)$ is inner. Proof . We want to exhibit an element $\\sigma\\in S_n$ such that $\\alpha(g)=\\sigma g\\sigma^{-1}$ for every $g$. It suffices to find a $\\sigma$ for which $\\alpha(\\tau)=\\sigma \\tau\\sigma^{-1}$ holds for every transposition $\\tau$, since every permutation is a product of transpositions. It further suffices to find a $\\sigma$ for which $\\alpha(1k)=\\sigma(1k)\\sigma^{-1}$ for each $1< k\\le n$, since these $n-1$ transpositions generate all the others. Pick distinct $1<\\ell_1,\\ell_2\\le n$. Then $\\rho=(1\\ell_2\\ell_1)=(1\\ell_1)(1\\ell_2)$ has order $3$, in which case $\\alpha(1\\ell_1)\\alpha(1\\ell_2)$ has order three as well. Without loss of generality, $\\alpha(1\\ell_1)=(ab)$ and $\\alpha(1\\ell_2)=(ac)$ for some $a,b,c$; since this holds for each distinct pair $\\ell_1,\\ell_2$, we find that for every $k$, $\\alpha(1k)=(af(k))$ for some $f(k)$. Let $\\sigma$ send $1$ to $a$ and $k$ to $f(k)$ for each $k>1$. This permutation satisfies our requirements. Lemma . For $n\\ne6$, the class of transpositions is the unique class of involutions with ${n\\choose2}$ elements. Proof . Consider the class of involutions with cycle type a product of $k>1$ disjoint cycles. Suppose $$\\frac{1}{k!}{n\\choose 2}{n-2\\choose2}\\cdots{n-2(k-1)\\choose2}={n\\choose2}.$$ The LHS is the size of the new conjugacy class. Setting $m=n-2$ and $k=r+1$, cancelling ${n\\choose2}$s, $${m\\choose2}\\cdots{m-2(r-1)\\choose2}=(r+1)!$$ The LHS is telescoping. Multiply by $2^r/(2r)!$ and get $${m\\choose2r}=\\frac{(r+1)!2^r}{(2r)!}=\\frac{r+1}{(2r-1)!!}$$ For $r>2$ the RHS is not even an integer (it is $<1$). The case $r=1$ gives $m(m-1)=4$ with no solution in $m$. Finally $r=2$ gives $m(m-1)(m-2)(m-3)=24$ which has positive solution $4$. Theorem . For $n\\ne6$, $\\mathrm{Out}(S_n)=1$. Proof . Combine the three lemmas. When $n\\ne6$, automorphisms permute conjugacy classes and in particular stabilize the transposition class (since the size of this class is unique among the classes), hence every automorphism is inner. Remark . This proof is adapted from this sketch from Wikipedia and these notes .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that the symmetric group \\( S_n \\) is complete, which means its center is trivial and all its automorphisms are inner. The question specifically asks for an easy proof that \\( \\mathrm{Aut}(S_n) = \\mathrm{Inn}(S_n) \\), given that \\( n \\neq 2, 6 \\).\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that \\( n \\) is an integer and that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. However, in the current problem, the conditions on \\( n \\) are different.\n\nFrom the original question, the key conditions mentioned are \\( n \\neq 2, 6 \\). The user also mentioned that \\( Z(S_n) = 1 \\), which they have already shown. So the assumptions here would likely be:\n\n1. \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n2. \\( n \\neq 2 \\).\n3. \\( n \\neq 6 \\).\n\nThese are separate because each addresses a different condition on \\( n \\). The problem then is to prove that \\( \\mathrm{Aut}(S_n) = \\mathrm{Inn}(S_n) \\), i.e., that the automorphism group of \\( S_n \\) is equal to its inner automorphism group, which would make \\( S_n \\) a complete group.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement also mentions that for \\( n \\neq 2 \\), \\( S_n \\) has no center, and for \\( n \\neq 6 \\), it has no outer automorphisms. But the user says they already showed \\( Z(S_n) = 1 \\), so maybe that part isn't an assumption here but a given. The problem is just about the automorphism part. However, the completeness requires both trivial center and all automorphisms inner. But since the user is asking specifically about the automorphism group, the assumptions would be on \\( n \\) excluding 2 and 6, because for n=2, the group is abelian and has a non-trivial center, but the user already handled the center part. So the main assumption here is \\( n \\neq 2,6 \\).\n\nSo the assumptions should list each exclusion separately. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( n \\) is a positive integer,\n- \\( n \\neq 2 \\),\n- \\( n \\neq 6 \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\mathrm{Aut}(S_n) = \\mathrm{Inn}(S_n) \\).\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for \\( n \\neq 6 \\), \\( S_n \\) has no outer automorphisms, and for \\( n \\neq 2 \\) it has no center\". So maybe the problem as posed by the user is to prove \\( \\mathrm{Aut}(S_n) = \\mathrm{Inn}(S_n) \\) under the assumptions that \\( n \\neq 2,6 \\). The user already knows \\( Z(S_n)=1 \\), so the problem is about the automorphism part. Therefore, the assumptions should include \\( n \\neq 2 \\) and \\( n \\neq 6 \\).\n\nBut do we need to assume \\( n \\geq 1 \\)? Probably, since symmetric groups are defined for \\( n \\geq 1 \\). So maybe include that as well, but the original problem might not state it explicitly. However, in the example, the assumption was just that \\( n \\) is an integer and divisible by 7, without specifying it's positive. But in group theory, \\( n \\) is usually a positive integer for symmetric groups. So maybe list:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( n \\) is a positive integer,\n- \\( n \\neq 2 \\),\n- \\( n \\neq 6 \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\mathrm{Aut}(S_n) = \\mathrm{Inn}(S_n) \\).\n\nBut the user's original question says \"for \\( n \\neq 2,6 \\), it is a complete group\". Since completeness requires both trivial center and all automorphisms inner, and the user already proved the center is trivial, the remaining part is to show that automorphisms are inner. Therefore, the problem is to prove that \\( \\mathrm{Aut}(S_n) = \\mathrm{Inn}(S_n) \\) when \\( n \\neq 2,6 \\).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the exclusions of 2 and 6, and the problem is about the automorphism group.\n\nSo, following the example's structure, each assumption is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( n \\) is a positive integer,\n- \\( n \\neq 2 \\),\n- \\( n \\neq 6 \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\mathrm{Aut}(S_n) = \\mathrm{Inn}(S_n) \\).\n\nI think that's correct. The key is each assumption is a separate condition on one object (here, \\( n \\)), and the problem is the main task given those assumptions.",
