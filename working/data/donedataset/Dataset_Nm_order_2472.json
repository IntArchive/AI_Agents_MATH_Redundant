    "AcceptedAnswer": "As far as I can tell, none of the answers so far gives a proof by induction. Here's one. Let $$S_n=\\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n}\\frac1k\\;.$$ By explicit computation $$\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac1{60}-S_{16}=\\frac{238793353}{20629078984800}\\gt0\\;.$$ As others have pointed out, the sequence monotonically increases, so this establishes the inequality up to $n=16$. Now we can prove $$\nS_n\\lt\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac1{4(n-1)}\n$$ for $n\\ge16$ by induction. The base case is handled above. The induction step is $$\n\\begin{align}\nS_{n+1}\n&=\nS_n+\\frac1{2n+1}+\\frac1{2n+2}-\\frac1{n+1}\n\\\\\n&=\nS_n+\\frac1{(2n+1)(2n+2)}\n\\\\\n&\\lt\nS_n+\\frac1{4n(n-1)}\n\\\\\n&\\lt\n\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac1{4(n-1)}+\\frac1{4n(n-1)}\n\\\\\n&=\n\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac1{4n}\\;.\n\\end{align}\n$$ The general insight to be gained here is that a proof by induction sometimes becomes easier when we make the conclusion stronger . That's because this not only strengthens the conclusion of the induction step but also its premise. In the present case, the original claim can't be proved directly by induction, since knowing that the inequality holds doesn't help in proving that it holds if we add something to the lesser side; but by strengthening the conclusion slightly more for $n$ than for $n+1$ we can create some space to work with in the induction step.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the sum 1/(n+1) + 1/(n+2) + ... + 1/(2n) is less than 25/36 using mathematical induction, where n is at least 1. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how mathematical induction works. The basic steps are: prove the base case, assume it's true for some k, then prove it's true for k+1. \n\nSo the base case here is n=1. Let's check that. When n=1, the sum is just 1/(1+1) = 1/2. And 1/2 is 0.5, while 25/36 is approximately 0.694. So 0.5 < 0.694, which holds. So the base case works.\n\nNext, the induction hypothesis: assume that for some integer k ≥ 1, the sum from 1/(k+1) to 1/(2k) is less than 25/36. Then, we need to show that the sum for k+1, which is from 1/((k+1)+1) to 1/(2(k+1)) = 1/(2k+2), is also less than 25/36.\n\nLet me write out the sum for k+1. It would be 1/(k+2) + 1/(k+3) + ... + 1/(2k+2). Compare this to the sum for k, which is 1/(k+1) + ... + 1/(2k). The sum for k+1 is the sum for k, minus 1/(k+1), plus 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2). Wait, let me verify that. \n\nWhen we go from n=k to n=k+1, the original sum for n=k is from (k+1) to 2k. For n=k+1, it's from (k+2) to 2(k+1) = 2k+2. So the new sum is the old sum minus the term 1/(k+1) and adding two new terms: 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2). \n\nTherefore, the sum for k+1 is equal to [sum for k] - 1/(k+1) + 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2). \n\nUnder the induction hypothesis, the sum for k is less than 25/36. So we need to show that [sum for k] - 1/(k+1) + 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2) < 25/36.\n\nBut since [sum for k] < 25/36, we can substitute and get that the sum for k+1 is less than 25/36 - 1/(k+1) + 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2). Therefore, we need to show that -1/(k+1) + 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2) < 0. If this is true, then adding a negative number to 25/36 would keep the sum less than 25/36.\n\nSo let's compute -1/(k+1) + 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2). Let's combine the terms:\n\nFirst, 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2) = [ (2k+2) + (2k+1) ] / [ (2k+1)(2k+2) ) ] = (4k + 3) / [ (2k+1)(2k+2) ]\n\nSo the entire expression is -1/(k+1) + (4k + 3)/[ (2k+1)(2k+2) ]\n\nNow, let's see if this is negative. Let's compute:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n(4k + 3)/[ (2k+1)(2k+2) ] - 1/(k+1)\n\nTo combine these two terms, let's find a common denominator. The first term's denominator is (2k+1)(2k+2), and the second term's denominator is (k+1). Notice that (2k+2) = 2(k+1), so the common denominator would be 2(k+1)(2k+1). Let's rewrite both fractions:\n\nFirst term: (4k + 3) / [ (2k+1)(2(k+1)) ] = (4k + 3) / [ 2(k+1)(2k+1) ]\n\nSecond term: 1/(k+1) = 2(2k+1)/[2(k+1)(2k+1)]\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me compute correctly. Let's express 1/(k+1) as [2(2k+1)] / [2(k+1)(2k+1)] but that's not accurate. Wait, to get the denominator of the second term to be 2(k+1)(2k+1), we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2(2k+1). So:\n\n1/(k+1) = [2(2k+1)] / [2(k+1)(2k+1)]\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n[ (4k + 3) - 2(2k + 1) ] / [ 2(k+1)(2k+1) ]\n\nCompute the numerator:\n\n4k + 3 - 4k - 2 = (4k - 4k) + (3 - 2) = 1\n\nSo the entire expression is 1 / [ 2(k+1)(2k+1) ]\n\nWhich is positive. Wait, but this contradicts our previous thought that we needed this expression to be negative. Because we have:\n\nsum_{k+1} = sum_k - 1/(k+1) + 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2)\n\nIf sum_k < 25/36, then sum_{k+1} < 25/36 + [ -1/(k+1) + 1/(2k+1) + 1/(2k+2) ]\n\nBut the term in brackets is positive (as we just found 1 / [ 2(k+1)(2k+1) ] ), so this would mean sum_{k+1} < 25/36 + something positive. Therefore, the induction step doesn't hold as we tried to do it. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nThis suggests that the straightforward induction approach might not work because the difference between sum_{k+1} and sum_k is positive, meaning that the sum increases as k increases. Wait, but the original inequality is that the sum is less than 25/36. If the sum increases with k, then we need to show that even as it increases, it never exceeds 25/36. So perhaps the base case is n=1, and then when n increases, the sum increases but still stays below 25/36. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the induction step as I tried isn't sufficient. Let me check for a few values. For n=1, sum is 1/2 ≈0.5. For n=2, sum is 1/3 +1/4 ≈0.583. For n=3, 1/4 +1/5 +1/6 ≈0.25 +0.2 +0.1667≈0.6167. For n=4, 1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8≈0.2+0.1667+0.1429+0.125≈0.6346. For n=5, sum would be approximately 0.6456. Continuing up, let's see when it approaches. As n approaches infinity, the sum approaches ln(2n) - ln(n) = ln(2) ≈0.6931, which is about 0.6931. But 25/36 is approximately 0.6944. So the sum approaches ln(2) ≈0.6931, which is just below 25/36. Therefore, the inequality holds for all n ≥1, and approaches 25/36 from below. \n\nSo the maximum is approaching ln(2), which is less than 25/36. So perhaps the induction needs to show that the sum increases but remains below 25/36. But how do we do that with induction?\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of trying to use the induction step directly, we need a different approach. Perhaps the problem requires strengthening the induction hypothesis. Maybe instead of assuming S(k) <25/36, we need to bound S(k) with a tighter upper bound that allows us to show S(k+1) <25/36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find an upper bound for S(n) that is easier to handle inductively. For example, maybe we can show that S(n) ≤25/36 - c/n for some constant c, so that when we go from n=k to n=k+1, the increase in the sum is offset by the decrease in the term -c/k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the difference S(n+1) - S(n) and show that it is decreasing, so that the total increase is bounded. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the limit is ln(2)≈0.6931 and 25/36≈0.6944, so there's a small gap. Therefore, for all n, the sum is less than ln(2) + something, which is still less than 25/36. But I don't know how to translate that into induction.\n\nWait, but the problem specifically asks to use mathematical induction, so we have to find a way.\n\nLet me try to compute S(n+1) - S(n). As before, S(n) = sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} 1/k.\n\nThen S(n+1) = sum_{k=n+2}^{2n+2} 1/k = sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} 1/k - 1/(n+1) + 1/(2n+1) +1/(2n+2).\n\nSo S(n+1) = S(n) - 1/(n+1) +1/(2n+1)+1/(2n+2).\n\nTherefore, the difference is S(n+1) - S(n) = [ -1/(n+1) +1/(2n+1)+1/(2n+2) ].\n\nEarlier, we found this difference equals 1 / [ 2(n+1)(2n+1) ) ] which is positive. So S(n) is increasing. Therefore, since S(n) approaches ln(2), which is less than 25/36, then if we can show that the limit is less than 25/36, and S(n) is increasing, then if S(n) is always less than 25/36, the induction would hold. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that S(n) is increasing and bounded above by 25/36, so by induction, if we can show that S(n) approaches something less than 25/36, and each step S(n+1) is still less than 25/36. But this seems like we need to know the limit already, which might not be helpful for induction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute S(n) for n=1,2,3,... and see when it's less than 25/36. For n=1: 1/2=0.5 <25/36≈0.694. For n=2:≈0.583. For n=3:≈0.6167. For n=4:≈0.6346. For n=5:≈0.6456. For n=6: sum from 7 to 12: 1/7≈0.1429, 1/8≈0.125, 1/9≈0.1111, 1/10≈0.1, 1/11≈0.0909, 1/12≈0.0833. Total≈0.1429+0.125=0.2679; +0.1111=0.379; +0.1=0.479; +0.0909≈0.5699; +0.0833≈0.6532. For n=6, sum≈0.6532 <25/36≈0.6944. For n=7: sum from 8 to14. Let's approximate: 1/8=0.125, 1/9≈0.1111, 1/10=0.1, 1/11≈0.0909, 1/12≈0.0833, 1/13≈0.0769, 1/14≈0.0714. Adding these: 0.125+0.1111=0.2361; +0.1=0.3361; +0.0909=0.427; +0.0833=0.5103; +0.0769=0.5872; +0.0714≈0.6586. Still less than 0.6944.\n\nContinuing, n=8: sum from 9 to16. The terms get smaller, but adding more terms. 1/9≈0.1111, 1/10≈0.1, ..., up to 1/16≈0.0625. Let's estimate: 0.1111+0.1=0.2111; +0.0909≈0.302; +0.0833≈0.3853; +0.0769≈0.4622; +0.0714≈0.5336; +0.0667≈0.6003; +0.0625≈0.6628. Still below 0.6944.\n\nAs n increases, the sum approaches ln(2)≈0.6931, which is just under 25/36≈0.6944. So for all n, the sum is less than ln(2) + ε for some ε, but how to use induction to show it's less than 25/36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that 25/36 is approximately 0.6944, which is slightly larger than ln(2). Therefore, the difference between 25/36 and the sum S(n) is always positive but decreasing. To use induction, perhaps we can show that S(n) <25/36 - c/n, and then show that the increment when moving to n+1 doesn't exceed the decrease in the term -c/n. But this might require finding the right c.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to bound the difference S(n+1) - S(n) and relate it to 25/36.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let's think differently. Maybe instead of directly comparing S(n+1) to 25/36, use the induction hypothesis that S(n) <25/36 and then show that S(n+1) <25/36. But since S(n+1) = S(n) + [S(n+1)-S(n)], and S(n+1)-S(n) is positive, we can't just use S(n) <25/36 to get S(n+1) <25/36 + something. That approach doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to find a tighter bound for S(n). Let's consider that S(n) = H_{2n} - H_n, where H_n is the nth harmonic number. We know that H_n ≈ ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n^2) + ..., so H_{2n} - H_n ≈ ln(2n) - ln(n) = ln(2). But to get precise inequalities, maybe use the integral test. The sum from n+1 to 2n of 1/k can be represented as the integral from n to 2n of 1/x dx, which is ln(2n) - ln(n) = ln(2). But this is an approximation. Alternatively, use the inequality that for decreasing functions, the integral from a to b of f(x) dx is less than the sum from a+1 to b of f(k). So integrating 1/x from n to 2n gives ln(2), and the sum S(n) = sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} 1/k is less than the integral from n to 2n of 1/x dx + 1/(n+1). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the sum S(n) is less than ln(2n) - ln(n) + 1/(n+1). Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the maximum of S(n) is approaching ln(2), and ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056..., and 25/36 is approximately 0.69444444444..., so there's a small gap. Therefore, for all n, S(n) < ln(2) + something, but we need to show that even the maximum limit is less than 25/36. But how to use induction for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that S(n) < ln(2) + 1/(4n). If we can show that ln(2) +1/(4n) <25/36 for all n ≥1, then since S(n) < ln(2) +1/(4n), this would imply S(n) <25/36. Let's check for n=1: ln(2) +1/4≈0.6931 +0.25=0.9431, which is greater than 25/36≈0.6944, so this doesn't work. Bad idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the inequality S(n) < ln(2) + 1/(2n). For n=1, ln(2)+0.5≈0.6931+0.5=1.1931>0.6944. Also not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, find an upper bound for S(n) that is easier to handle. Let's consider that the sum S(n) = sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} 1/k. Each term 1/k ≤1/(n+1) for k ≥n+1. But there are n terms, so S(n) ≤n/(n+1). But n/(n+1) approaches 1 as n increases, which is way larger than 25/36. So that's not useful.\n\nAlternatively, use the integral from n+1 to 2n+1 of 1/x dx < S(n) < integral from n to 2n of 1/x dx. The left integral is ln(2n+1) - ln(n+1) = ln((2n+1)/(n+1)) = ln(2 -1/(n+1)). The right integral is ln(2n) - ln(n) = ln(2). Therefore, S(n) < ln(2). But ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, which is less than 25/36≈0.6944. Therefore, S(n) <ln(2) <25/36. Hence, the inequality holds for all n≥1. Wait, if that's the case, then we can just use the integral bound to show that S(n) <ln(2) <25/36. But the problem specifies to use mathematical induction. So maybe the induction step can use this integral bound?\n\nBut the user insists on using induction. So perhaps we need to proceed differently. Let's try to find an upper bound that can be handled inductively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the difference 25/36 - S(n) and show that it's positive for all n≥1 using induction.\n\nBase case n=1: 25/36 -1/2=25/36-18/36=7/36>0.\n\nAssume true for n=k: 25/36 -S(k) >0.\n\nNeed to show 25/36 -S(k+1) >0.\n\nBut S(k+1)=S(k) -1/(k+1)+1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2).\n\nSo 25/36 -S(k+1)=25/36 -[S(k) -1/(k+1)+1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2)].\n\n= [25/36 -S(k)] +1/(k+1) - [1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2)].\n\nBy induction hypothesis, 25/36 -S(k) >0. So if we can show that 1/(k+1) - [1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2)] >0, then the entire expression would be positive, hence 25/36 -S(k+1) >0.\n\nBut earlier, we found that 1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2) -1/(k+1) =1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)] >0. Therefore, 1/(k+1) - [1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2)] = -1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)] <0. Hence, [25/36 -S(k)] + (negative term). Therefore, even though [25/36 -S(k)] is positive, adding a negative term might make the total positive or negative. Therefore, this approach doesn't directly help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need a stronger induction hypothesis. Instead of just assuming S(k) <25/36, assume that S(k) <25/36 - c/k for some c>0. Then, when we go to k+1, we can have S(k+1) = S(k) + [difference terms]. If the difference terms are less than c/k -c/(k+1), then we can maintain the inequality.\n\nBut finding such a c is tricky. Let's try.\n\nAssume S(k) <25/36 -c/k.\n\nThen S(k+1) = S(k) -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2).\n\nSo S(k+1) <25/36 -c/k -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2).\n\nWe need this to be <25/36 -c/(k+1).\n\nSo need:\n\n25/36 -c/k -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2) <25/36 -c/(k+1).\n\nSubtract 25/36 from both sides:\n\n-c/k -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2) < -c/(k+1).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips):\n\nc/k +1/(k+1) -1/(2k+1)-1/(2k+2) >c/(k+1).\n\nRearrange:\n\nc/k -c/(k+1) +1/(k+1) -1/(2k+1)-1/(2k+2) >0.\n\nFactor c:\n\nc(1/k -1/(k+1)) + [1/(k+1) -1/(2k+1)-1/(2k+2)] >0.\n\nCompute the terms:\n\n1/k -1/(k+1) =1/[k(k+1)].\n\nAnd earlier, we found that 1/(k+1) -1/(2k+1)-1/(2k+2) = -1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)].\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\nc/[k(k+1)] -1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)] >0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2k(k+1)(2k+1) to eliminate denominators:\n\n2c(2k+1) -k >0.\n\nThus:\n\n4ck +2c -k >0.\n\nWe need this to hold for all k≥1. Let's solve for c:\n\nk(4c -1) +2c >0.\n\nTo ensure this holds for all k≥1, the coefficient of k should be non-negative, and the constant term should also be positive.\n\nSo:\n\n4c -1 ≥0 ⇒ c ≥1/4.\n\nAnd 2c >0 ⇒ c>0.\n\nTherefore, choosing c=1/4, we check:\n\nFor c=1/4:\n\nLeft side of the inequality: (4*(1/4) -1)k +2*(1/4)= (1-1)k +0.5=0.5>0.\n\nThus, with c=1/4, the inequality holds.\n\nTherefore, if we set c=1/4, then the induction step works. \n\nSo the induction hypothesis would be S(k) <25/36 -1/(4k).\n\nLet's check the base case n=1:\n\nS(1)=1/2=0.5. 25/36 -1/(4*1)=25/36 -1/4=25/36 -9/36=16/36≈0.4444. But 0.5 <0.4444 is false. So the base case doesn't hold. Therefore, this approach fails for n=1.\n\nHmm, problem. So the choice of c=1/4 works for the induction step but fails the base case. Therefore, we need to adjust c. Maybe choose a smaller c.\n\nAlternatively, let's check for higher n. For n=2, S(2)=1/3+1/4≈0.5833. 25/36≈0.6944. If we take c=1/8:\n\nCheck induction hypothesis S(k) <25/36 -1/(8k).\n\nFor k=1: 25/36 -1/8≈0.6944-0.125=0.5694. S(1)=0.5 <0.5694: holds.\n\nFor k=2: 25/36 -1/(16)=0.6944-0.0625≈0.6319. S(2)≈0.5833 <0.6319: holds.\n\nThen, assume S(k) <25/36 -1/(8k). Need to show S(k+1) <25/36 -1/(8(k+1)).\n\nFollowing the previous steps with c=1/8:\n\nWe need 4c -1 ≥0 ⇒ c≥1/4, which c=1/8 does not satisfy. Therefore, the inequality would not hold for the induction step.\n\nThus, this approach requires c≥1/4, but then the base case fails. Therefore, perhaps this method isn't suitable.\n\nAnother idea: maybe instead of subtracting a term like c/k, subtract a term that decreases faster, like c/k^2. Let's try.\n\nAssume S(k) <25/36 -c/k^2.\n\nThen S(k+1) <25/36 -c/k^2 -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2).\n\nWe need this to be <25/36 -c/(k+1)^2.\n\nSo:\n\n-c/k^2 -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2) < -c/(k+1)^2.\n\nRearranging:\n\n-c/k^2 +c/(k+1)^2 <1/(k+1) -1/(2k+1)-1/(2k+2).\n\nAs before, the right-hand side is -1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)].\n\nLeft-hand side: c[ (k+1)^2 -k^2 ] / [k^2(k+1)^2 ] =c[2k+1]/[k^2(k+1)^2].\n\nSo:\n\nc(2k+1)/[k^2(k+1)^2] < -1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)].\n\nBut the left side is positive (c>0), and the right side is negative. So this inequality can't hold. Therefore, this approach is invalid.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different way.\n\nLet me think back to the original difference. We have S(n+1) = S(n) -1/(n+1) +1/(2n+1)+1/(2n+2). We need to show that if S(n) <25/36, then S(n+1) <25/36.\n\nBut as S(n+1) = S(n) + [ -1/(n+1) +1/(2n+1)+1/(2n+2) ]\n\nWe need to show that [ -1/(n+1) +1/(2n+1)+1/(2n+2) ] <0. However, we already found that this difference is 1/[2(n+1)(2n+1)] >0. Therefore, S(n+1) = S(n) + positive term. Therefore, if S(n) <25/36, then S(n+1) = S(n) + something positive <25/36 + something. But we need to show that this \"something\" doesn't push it over 25/36.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps use the fact that the difference added is decreasing. So even though we are adding a positive term each time, the amount we add gets smaller, so the sum approaches a limit below 25/36.\n\nBut induction requires that if S(n) <25/36, then S(n+1) <25/36. But since we are adding a positive term, we can't directly conclude that. Unless the amount added is less than the remaining room between S(n) and 25/36.\n\nAlternatively, for each n, the difference added is 1/[2(n+1)(2n+1)]. We can sum these differences from n=1 to infinity and see if the total sum is less than 25/36 - S(1).\n\nBut S(1)=0.5, and 25/36≈0.6944. The difference is ≈0.1944. The sum of the differences from n=1 to infinity is sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/[2(n+1)(2n+1)].\n\nCompute this sum:\n\nsum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/[2(n+1)(2n+1)].\n\nLet me compute it by partial fractions.\n\nLet me write 1/[(n+1)(2n+1)] = A/(n+1) + B/(2n+1).\n\nMultiply both sides by (n+1)(2n+1):\n\n1 = A(2n+1) + B(n+1).\n\nSet n=-1: 1 = A(-1) + B(0) ⇒ -A=1 ⇒ A=-1.\n\nSet n=-0.5: 1= A(0) + B(0.5) ⇒ 0.5B=1 ⇒ B=2.\n\nTherefore, 1/[(n+1)(2n+1)] = -1/(n+1) +2/(2n+1).\n\nTherefore, the sum becomes:\n\nsum_{n=1}^\\infty [ -1/(n+1) +2/(2n+1) ] *1/2.\n\n= (1/2) sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ -1/(n+1) +2/(2n+1) ].\n\nLet's split the sum:\n\n= (1/2)[ -sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(n+1) +2 sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(2n+1) ].\n\n= (1/2)[ -sum_{k=2}^\\infty 1/k +2 sum_{m=3}^\\infty 1/m where m is odd ].\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, note that sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(2n+1) = sum_{k=3}^\\infty 1/k where k is odd.\n\nThe sum of reciprocals of all odd numbers from 1 is divergent, but here we start from k=3. However, our original sum is multiplied by 1/2, and subtracted by sum from k=2 to infinity of 1/k. This seems messy. Perhaps compute it numerically.\n\nBut the sum we are trying to compute is (1/2)[ - (H_∞ -1) +2 (sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(2n+1) ) ]\n\nBut H_∞ diverges, so the sum would be divergent? But that's not possible, since each term 1/[2(n+1)(2n+1)] ~1/(4n^2), which converges. Therefore, my partial fraction approach must have an error. Wait, no, because the original sum is sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/[2(n+1)(2n+1)], which is O(1/n^2), so converges.\n\nWait, but according to the partial fractions:\n\nsum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/[2(n+1)(2n+1)] = (1/2) sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ -1/(n+1) +2/(2n+1) ]\n\nLet's rewrite the sums:\n\nsum_{n=1}^\\infty -1/(n+1) = -sum_{k=2}^\\infty 1/k = -(H_∞ -1).\n\nsum_{n=1}^\\infty 2/(2n+1) = 2 sum_{m=3}^\\infty 1/m where m is odd.\n\nBut how do these sums relate? Let's note that:\n\nsum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/m = sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(2n-1) + sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(2n).\n\nTherefore, sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(2n-1) = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/m - sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(2n) = H_∞ - (1/2)H_∞) = diverges. So the sum of reciprocals of odd numbers diverges.\n\nBut our sum is sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(2n+1) = sum_{m=3}^\\infty 1/m where m is odd. Which is sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m+1) = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m+1) = (sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k) -1 - sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)) = H_∞ -1 - (1/2 H_∞) = (1/2 H_∞) -1, which also diverges. Therefore, the original sum of differences diverges, but this contradicts the earlier assessment that it converges. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition.\n\nWait, no. The original sum is sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/[2(n+1)(2n+1)]. Let's compute it numerically for a few terms to see.\n\nFor n=1: 1/[2*2*3] =1/12≈0.0833\n\nn=2:1/[2*3*5]=1/30≈0.0333\n\nn=3:1/[2*4*7]=1/56≈0.0179\n\nn=4:1/[2*5*9]=1/90≈0.0111\n\nn=5:1/[2*6*11]=1/132≈0.0076\n\nAdding these:0.0833+0.0333=0.1166; +0.0179=0.1345; +0.0111=0.1456; +0.0076=0.1532. Continuing, the terms keep getting smaller, and the total sum converges to around 0.2 or so. So the sum converges to a value less than 0.2. But 25/36 - S(1)=0.6944-0.5=0.1944. So the total sum of differences is approximately 0.1532 up to n=5 and would add a bit more but less than 0.2. Therefore, the total sum of differences is less than 0.2, which is roughly equal to the room we have (0.1944). Therefore, the sum S(n) increases by less than 0.1944, so remains below 0.6944. However, this is a heuristic argument, not a proof by induction.\n\nBut how to translate this into an induction step. Maybe note that the total increase from n=1 to infinity is less than 0.1944, so since S(1)=0.5, and each step adds a positive term but the total sum of additions is less than 0.1944, then S(n) <0.5 +0.1944=0.6944. But to formalize this, we need to use the fact that the series converges, which might not be straightforward in induction.\n\nAlternatively, consider that S(n) is increasing and bounded above by 25/36, so by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it converges. Since the limit is ln(2)≈0.6931<25/36≈0.6944, the inequality holds for all n. However, this is analysis, not induction.\n\nBut the problem specifically requires mathematical induction. Therefore, perhaps the solution involves a different approach. Let's look for hints in standard inequalities.\n\nThe sum S(n) = sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} 1/k is known to approach ln(2). To bound it, we can use the inequality that for m < n, sum_{k=m+1}^n 1/k < ln(n/m). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for the harmonic series, H_{2n} - H_n = ln(2n) +γ +1/(4n) - ... - (ln(n) +γ +1/(2n) - ...) = ln(2) -1/(2n) + ... So, using the approximation H_{2n} - H_n ≈ ln(2) -1/(2n). Therefore, S(n) < ln(2) -1/(4n), but I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, use the inequality H_{2n} - H_n < ln(2) +1/(2n) -1/(2n+1). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the difference between H_{2n} - H_n and ln(2) is decreasing. But again, not helpful for induction.\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that S(n) = sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} 1/k < sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} 1/(n+1) + integral from n+1 to 2n of 1/x dx. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Taylor series expansion of ln(2) and compare. But this seems too vague.\n\nGiven that time is limited, perhaps the intended solution is to use induction with a stronger hypothesis. Let's see. Assume that S(k) <25/36 - d_k, where d_k is a positive sequence such that the difference added each step is less than d_k -d_{k+1}.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the difference added each step is 1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)] =1/(4k^2 +6k +2). Let's compare this to 25/36 -S(k). We need 25/36 -S(k+1) =25/36 -S(k) - [ -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2) ] =25/36 -S(k) -1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)].\n\nBut this doesn't directly help. \n\nAlternatively, consider that 25/36 - S(n) is a decreasing sequence (since S(n) increases), and we need to show it's always positive. But induction requires showing that if it's positive for n=k, it's positive for n=k+1. But since S(k+1) =S(k)+positive term, then 25/36 -S(k+1)=25/36 -S(k) - positive term. So if we assume 25/36 -S(k) > positive term, then it holds. But we need to show that 25/36 -S(k) >1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)].\n\nBut since S(k) approaches ln(2), 25/36 -S(k) approaches 25/36 -ln(2)≈0.6944-0.6931≈0.0013, which is very small. For large k, the difference added is about 1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)]≈1/(4k^2). So we need 0.0013 >1/(4k^2). For k≥1, 1/(4k^2) ≤1/4=0.25, which is not less than 0.0013. Therefore, this approach fails for small k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that for n≥1, S(n) <25/36 -1/(36n). Let's check for n=1: 25/36 -1/36=24/36=2/3≈0.6667. S(1)=0.5<0.6667. For n=2:25/36 -1/72≈0.6944-0.0139≈0.6805. S(2)=0.5833<0.6805. Assume true for n=k, then S(k+1)=S(k) +1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)]. Need S(k+1) <25/36 -1/(36(k+1)).\n\nAssuming S(k) <25/36 -1/(36k), then:\n\nS(k+1) <25/36 -1/(36k) +1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)].\n\nNeed this to be <25/36 -1/(36(k+1)).\n\nSo:\n\n-1/(36k) +1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)] < -1/(36(k+1)).\n\nMultiply both sides by 36k(k+1)(2k+1) to eliminate denominators:\n\n- (k+1)(2k+1) + 18k < -k(2k+1).\n\nExpand left side:\n\n- (2k^2 +3k +1) +18k = -2k^2 -3k -1 +18k = -2k^2 +15k -1.\n\nRight side: -k(2k+1)= -2k^2 -k.\n\nSo inequality becomes:\n\n-2k^2 +15k -1 < -2k^2 -k.\n\nAdd 2k^2 to both sides:\n\n15k -1 < -k.\n\n16k <1.\n\nWhich implies k<1/16. But k≥1, so this is impossible. Therefore, this approach fails.\n\nI'm running out of ideas. Maybe the original problem expects us to perform induction up to a certain point and then use the integral bound. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo or requires a specific trick.\n\nWait, let's look at the original problem statement again: \"prove by mathematical induction, n≥1\". The inequality is strict: sum <25/36.\n\nMaybe the key is to strengthen the induction hypothesis to a form that allows the induction step to hold. For example, assume S(k) ≤25/36 - c, where c is a positive constant. But this might not work for all k.\n\nAlternatively, note that the maximum value of the sum S(n) approaches ln(2)≈0.6931, which is less than 25/36≈0.6944. Therefore, for all n≥1, S(n) <25/36. However, to prove this by induction, we need to show that S(n) is always less than 25/36, even as it increases. The challenge is that induction typically requires showing that the next term is less than the bound, but since the sequence is increasing, we need to show that the limit is less than 25/36.\n\nBut how to incorporate the limit into the induction step. Maybe use the fact that S(n) approaches ln(2) and for all n, S(n) <ln(2) <25/36. Therefore, by induction, since S(n) <ln(2), and ln(2) <25/36, then S(n) <25/36. But this requires knowing that S(n) <ln(2), which might be proven by induction.\n\nBut how to show S(n) <ln(2) by induction.\n\nBase case n=1: S(1)=1/2=0.5 <ln(2)≈0.6931: true.\n\nAssume S(k) <ln(2). Then S(k+1)=S(k) + [difference terms]. We need to show S(k+1) <ln(2).\n\nBut since the difference terms are positive, this would require S(k) + positive term <ln(2), which can't be inferred from S(k) <ln(2). Thus, this approach also fails.\n\nTherefore, the only way to use induction is to combine it with another inequality that bounds the sum from above. For example, show by induction that S(n) <25/36 -epsilon(n), where epsilon(n) is a positive sequence that decreases to 25/36 -ln(2).\n\nBut this seems too involved for a standard induction problem. Maybe the problem has a specific trick.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is from a source where the upper bound 25/36 is not tight, and they expect students to use induction with some approximations.\n\nLet's try to compute S(n) for n=1,2,3,... and see:\n\nn=1: 1/2=0.5 <25/36≈0.6944\n\nn=2:1/3+1/4≈0.5833 <0.6944\n\nn=3:≈0.6167 <0.6944\n\nn=4:≈0.6346 <0.6944\n\nn=5:≈0.6456 <0.6944\n\nn=6:≈0.6532 <0.6944\n\nn=7:≈0.6586 <0.6944\n\nn=8:≈0.6628 <0.6944\n\nn=9: sum from 10 to18. Let's compute approximately:\n\n1/10=0.1, 1/11≈0.0909, 1/12≈0.0833, 1/13≈0.0769, 1/14≈0.0714, 1/15≈0.0667, 1/16≈0.0625, 1/17≈0.0588, 1/18≈0.0556.\n\nAdding these:\n\n0.1+0.0909=0.1909; +0.0833=0.2742; +0.0769=0.3511; +0.0714=0.4225; +0.0667=0.4892; +0.0625=0.5517; +0.0588=0.6105; +0.0556≈0.6661. Wait, this sum for n=9 (sum from 10 to18) is approximately 0.6661, which is still less than 25/36≈0.6944.\n\nSimilarly for n=10: sum from 11 to20. Let's add:\n\n1/11≈0.0909, 1/12≈0.0833, ..., up to 1/20=0.05.\n\nSum:0.0909+0.0833=0.1742; +0.0769=0.2511; +0.0714=0.3225; +0.0667=0.3892; +0.0625=0.4517; +0.0588=0.5105; +0.0556≈0.5661; +0.0526≈0.6187; +0.05≈0.6687. Still less than 0.6944.\n\nAs n increases, the sum approaches ln(2)≈0.6931, which is still less than 25/36≈0.6944. So for all n≥1, the sum is less than 25/36. However, proving this by induction requires showing that even as we add the positive difference each time, the total never exceeds 25/36. Since the difference added each time is very small for large n, and the total sum approaches a limit less than 25/36, by induction, if we can show that for all n, S(n) <25/36, then the induction holds. But how to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that S(n) <25/36 for n=1,2,…,k, and then show S(k+1) <25/36. But since S(k+1) = S(k) + positive term, we need to ensure that even with the largest possible S(k) (which would be approaching 25/36), adding the difference term doesn't push it over. Since the difference term for large k is approximately 1/(4k^2), and the gap between S(k) and 25/36 is approximately 25/36 -ln(2)≈0.0013, we need to ensure that 1/(4k^2) <0.0013 for all k≥1. But 1/(4k^2) <0.0013 ⇒ k^2>1/(0.0052)≈192.3 ⇒k>13.86. So for k≥14, the difference added is less than the gap. However, for k<14, we need to manually verify that S(k) + difference <25/36.\n\nThis suggests that the induction step would require checking the cases from n=1 up to n=13 manually, and then for n≥14, the difference added is small enough that it won't exceed the gap. But this is not a standard induction proof and seems cumbersome.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo and the intended upper bound was 25/36 for a specific n, but the user states it's for all n≥1. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to the induction step.\n\nLet me try to consider the difference between 25/36 and S(n) and show that it's always positive.\n\nAs S(n) approaches ln(2), and 25/36≈0.6944>ln(2)≈0.6931, there is a small gap. Therefore, for all n≥1, S(n) <25/36. But how to show this via induction.\n\nAnother idea: Use the inequality that for n≥1, S(n) ≤25/36 -1/(36(2n+1)). Let's check for n=1:25/36 -1/(36*3)=25/36 -1/108=75/108 -1/108=74/108≈0.6852. S(1)=0.5<0.6852. Assume true for n=k, then S(k) ≤25/36 -1/(36(2k+1)). Then S(k+1)=S(k) -1/(k+1)+1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2). Substitute:\n\nS(k+1) ≤25/36 -1/(36(2k+1)) -1/(k+1)+1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2).\n\nNeed to show this is ≤25/36 -1/(36(2k+3)).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n25/36 -1/(36(2k+3)).\n\nThe left-hand side:\n\n25/36 -1/(36(2k+1)) -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2).\n\nCombine terms:\n\n25/36 -1/(36(2k+1)) + [ -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2) ].\n\nWe already know that -1/(k+1) +1/(2k+1)+1/(2k+2) =1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)].\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n25/36 -1/(36(2k+1)) +1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)].\n\nWe need to show this is ≤25/36 -1/(36(2k+3)).\n\nSubtract 25/36 from both sides:\n\n-1/(36(2k+1)) +1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)] ≤ -1/(36(2k+3)).\n\nMultiply both sides by 36(2k+1)(2k+3)(k+1) to eliminate denominators:\n\n- (2k+3)(k+1) +18(2k+3) ≤ - (k+1)(2k+1).\n\nExpand left side:\n\n- (2k^2 +5k +3) +36k +54 = -2k^2 -5k -3 +36k +54= -2k^2 +31k +51.\n\nRight side:\n\n- (2k^2 +3k +1).\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n-2k^2 +31k +51 +2k^2 +3k +1 =34k +52 ≥0.\n\nWhich is true for all k≥1.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds. Therefore, by induction, S(n) ≤25/36 -1/(36(2n+1)) <25/36.\n\nTherefore, the induction holds with the hypothesis S(k) ≤25/36 -1/(36(2k+1)).\n\nLet's verify the base case n=1:\n\nS(1)=1/2=0.5. The bound is25/36 -1/(36*3)=25/36 -1/108≈0.6944-0.0093≈0.6851. 0.5<0.6851 holds.\n\nInduction step: Assume S(k) ≤25/36 -1/(36(2k+1)).\n\nThen S(k+1) ≤25/36 -1/(36(2k+1)) +1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)].\n\nWe need to show this is ≤25/36 -1/(36(2k+3)).\n\nWhich reduces to showing:\n\n-1/(36(2k+1)) +1/[2(k+1)(2k+1)] ≤ -1/(36(2k+3)).\n\nAs shown earlier, this inequality holds, hence completing the induction.\n\nTherefore, the induction hypothesis can be strengthened with the term -1/(36(2n+1)), allowing the induction step to proceed. Hence, the original inequality holds.",
