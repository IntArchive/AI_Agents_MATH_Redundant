    "Content": "Yesterday I received the following integral that might require some tedious steps to do $$\\int_0^{\\infty}{\\small\\left[ \\frac{x}{\\log^2\\left(e^{\\large x^2}-1\\right)}- \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{e^{\\large x^2}-1}\\log^2\\left(e^{\\large x^2}-1\\right)}-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{e^{\\large x^2}-1}\\log\\left(\\left(e^{\\large x^2}-1\\right)^2\\right)}\\right] \\ dx}=\\frac{K}{\\pi}$$ where $K$ is the Catalan's constant What to do? Well, one can let $x^2\\mapsto x$, $e^{x}-1\\mapsto x$ and then we get an integral where we can add a parameter of the type $x^s$, and then I have an integral $I(s)$ that I differentiate twice with respect to $s$, and then integrate over $[0,\\infty)$. Of course, the last step is to integrate twice with respect to $s$, but this is not the work I love. My feeling is that there is a pretty easy way to prove the integral result that I don't see yet,  but maybe you see it and share it with me.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I played a bit around with it Euler style (not worrying to much about establishing convergence; which I think should be fairly simple here if one needed this) and found a way to derive it from scratch. First make the substitution $t=\\log(e^{x^2}-1)$ and then make the second substitution $w=-t$ for the $t<0$ part of the resulting integral to get $$I = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dw}{w^2}\\left(1 + e^{-w} - 2e^{-w/2}\\right)\\frac{1}{1+e^{-w}}$$ We now expand the last part in a Taylor series and introduce (to be able to manipulate each term in the integral independently) a regularization factor $w^s$ into the integrand. This gives us $$I(s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty(-1)^n\\int_0^\\infty dw\\left(1 + e^{-w} - 2e^{-w/2}\\right)w^{s-2}e^{-nw}$$ where $I(0)$ is the value we are interested in. We can now easily evaluate the integral in terms of the $\\Gamma$-function, $$I(s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty(-1)^n\\left[\\frac{1}{n^{s-1}} + \\frac{1}{(n+1)^{s-1}} - \\frac{2^s}{(2n+1)^{s-1}}\\right]\\Gamma(s-1)$$ Each term of the sum is well defined in the limit $s\\to 0$ and using $\\lim\\limits_{s\\to 0}\\Gamma(s-1)s = -1$ together with $$\\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{1}{n^{s-1}} + \\frac{1}{(n+1)^{s-1}} - \\frac{2^s}{(2n+1)^{s-1}}}{s} = n\\left(2\\log(n+1/2)-\\log(n+1)-\\log(n)\\right)\\\\ + \\log(n+1/2)-\\log(n+1)$$ gives us $$I = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty(-1)^{n+1}\\left[n\\left(2\\log(n+1/2)-\\log(n+1)-\\log(n)\\right)\\\\ + \\log(n+1/2)-\\log(n+1)\\right]$$ which after collapsing the logs, turning it into a product and simplifying yields the identity $$e^{2I-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{(4n+1)^{2n}}\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\frac{(4k+3)^{4k+3}}{(4k+1)^{4k+1}}$$ which is identical to the one found here (Eq. 53) with $$I = \\frac{K}{\\pi}$$ A proof of the product identity above can be found here .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is talking about an integral that equals K over pi, where K is Catalan's constant. The integral is from 0 to infinity of a complicated expression involving x, log terms, and sqrt terms. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem statement mentions the integral equals K/pi, so the main assumption is that the integral evaluates to that. But looking at the original problem, the user also mentions some substitutions: letting x² become x, and e^x -1 become x. Then they talk about introducing a parameter x^s, differentiating twice, integrating over [0,infty), and then integrating twice with respect to s. However, the user is looking for an easier way. \n\nWait, the task is to structure the problem by listing assumptions. The assumptions should be one property or condition per line, applied to one object. So what are the key elements here? The integral's structure is given, but are there any implicit assumptions? For example, the functions involved must be integrable over [0, ∞), but maybe that's too obvious. The problem mentions substitutions and parameter introduction, but those are part of the attempted solution steps, not the problem's assumptions. \n\nThe main assumptions here are about the integral's form and the result. So the integral is defined as the integral from 0 to infinity of that expression, and the result is K/pi. Maybe the substitution steps are part of the method, but the problem itself doesn't state any conditions on x or the integrability. So perhaps the only assumption is the structure of the integrand and the domain of integration. But wait, the problem is to prove that the integral equals K/pi. So the assumption is the integral as given. Wait, no, the problem is the integral equals K/pi. The user is asking to prove that. So maybe the assumptions are just the integral's expression and the domain. Let me check the example provided. In the example, the original problem states that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions list that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem lists as assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because if n is any integer, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Maybe there was a mistake. But perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the user intended to have n divisible by 7? Hmm. Anyway, in the current problem, the user's original integral is presented as being equal to K/pi, and the task is to prove that. So the problem's assumptions would be the integral expression and the limits. But maybe there's an implicit substitution or variable change assumption. Wait, the user mentions substituting x² to x and e^x -1 to x, but those are part of their attempted method. The problem itself is just to evaluate the integral. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is the expression given: [x/(log²(e^{x²} -1)) - x/(sqrt(e^{x²}-1) log²(e^{x²}-1)) - x/(sqrt(e^{x²}-1) log((e^{x²}-1)^2))].\n- The result is equal to K/pi, where K is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\nThe integrand is the combination of three terms: [term1 - term2 - term3].\nEach term involves x, logarithmic functions, and square roots of e^{x²} - 1.\nThe result of the integral is K/π, where K is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Let me try to list each part as separate assumptions. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed from 0 to infinity.\nThe integrand is composed of three terms.\nThe first term is x divided by [log²(e^{x²} -1)].\nThe second term is -x divided by [sqrt(e^{x²} -1) multiplied by log²(e^{x²} -1)].\nThe third term is -x divided by [sqrt(e^{x²} -1) multiplied by log((e^{x²} -1)^2)].\nCatalan's constant K is involved in the result.\nThe integral evaluates to K divided by π.\n\nBut each assumption line should address one property or condition of one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞).\nThe integrand is a function of x.\nThe integrand consists of three separate terms subtracted from each other.\nThe first term is x / [log²(e^{x²} -1)].\nThe second term is x / [sqrt(e^{x²} -1) * log²(e^{x²} -1)].\nThe third term is x / [sqrt(e^{x²} -1) * log((e^{x²} -1)^2)].\nCatalan's constant K is a known constant.\nThe value of the integral is K / π.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to prove that the integral equals K/pi, so the problem statement is just that. The assumptions are the components of the integral. But maybe some of these are not assumptions but parts of the problem statement. Wait, the problem is to prove that the integral equals K/pi. The integral's expression and domain are given as part of the problem. Therefore, the assumptions should list all the conditions given in the problem that are necessary for the integral to hold. The problem doesn't state any explicit conditions on x or the functions beyond what's in the integral itself. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity.\nThe integrand is [x / log²(e^{x²} -1) - x / (sqrt(e^{x²} -1) log²(e^{x²} -1)) - x / (sqrt(e^{x²} -1) log((e^{x²} -1)^2))].\nThe result involves Catalan's constant K and π.\n\nBut each assumption line should be a single condition. So breaking down each component:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed over the domain [0, ∞).\nThe integrand's first term is x divided by the square of the logarithm of (e^{x²} -1).\nThe integrand's second term is -x divided by [the square root of (e^{x²} -1) multiplied by the square of the logarithm of (e^{x²} -1)].\nThe integrand's third term is -x divided by [the square root of (e^{x²} -1) multiplied by the logarithm of ((e^{x²} -1)^2)].\nThe result of the integral is K divided by π, where K is Catalan's constant.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. That seems to fit the format. So each part of the integrand is a separate assumption line. Then the problem is to prove that the integral equals K/pi.",
