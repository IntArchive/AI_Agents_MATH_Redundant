    "Content": "Let $S$ be the set of all graphs with vertex set $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$. A random graph $G\\in S$ has probability $2^{-{n \\choose 2}}$. Show that a random graph almost surely contains a triangle. My attempt so far: we want to show that as $n$ goes to infinity, the probability of a triangle-free graph goes to zero. I tried to find a general formula for the probability of a triangle-free graph with $n$ vertices, but it seems impossible. I know that for any three vertices, the probability of not being a triangle is $\\frac{7}{8}$, but I can't calculate the probability of the union of all such three vertices. Is there any other way to approach this problem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In this situation, you can greatly overestimate the probability of no triangle and still get it to approach zero.  Divide your set of $n$ vertices into disjoint sets of size $3$ (with perhaps one or two vertices left over if $n$ isn't divisible by $3$). So you've got at least $(n-2)/3$ pairwise disjoint sets of size $3$. What's the probability that none of these sets forms a triangle? Well, each one of these sets fails to form a triangle with probability $7/8$ (as you said in the question). And, because the three-element sets under consideration are disjoint, these probabilities, for different $3$-element sets, are independent.  So the probability that none of these $(n-2)/3$ (or more) sets forms a triangle is $(7/8)^{(n-2)/3}$ (or less).  This approaches zero as $n\\to\\infty$. The probability that there are no triangles at all is, of course, $\\leq$ the probability that none of our particular $3$-element sets forms a triangle, so it also approaches zero.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about showing that a random graph almost surely contains a triangle as n goes to infinity. The user mentions the set S of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,…,n}, each having probability 2^(-C(n,2)). They want to prove that the probability of a triangle-free graph approaches zero. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The set S consists of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,…,n}. So the first assumption is about S being the set of all such graphs.\n2. Each graph G in S has a probability of 2^(-C(n,2)). That's the second assumption, applying to the probability distribution over S.\n3. The problem is about showing that as n approaches infinity, the probability that G is triangle-free goes to zero. So the third assumption is about n approaching infinity, which affects the probability.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions like \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the key conditions are the definition of S, the probability measure, and the limit as n tends to infinity. The problem statement itself is to show that a random graph almost surely contains a triangle, which translates to the probability of triangle-free graphs tending to zero.\n\nSo breaking down the assumptions:\n\n- S is the set of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,…,n}.\n- The probability of each graph G in S is 2^(-n(n-1)/2).\n- The problem considers the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"a random graph almost surely contains a triangle\". The almost surely part refers to the probability approaching 1 as n tends to infinity. Therefore, the assumption is that n is going to infinity, but how to phrase that? The user's attempt mentions \"as n goes to infinity\", so that's part of the problem's condition. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. S is the set of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,…,n}.\n2. Each graph G in S is assigned probability 2^{-{n \\choose 2}}.\n3. The problem considers the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vertex set of each graph is {1,2,…,n},\nEach graph in S is chosen uniformly at random (since probability 2^{-C(n,2)} implies uniform distribution),\nThe problem involves the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the exact wording from the problem is \"A random graph G ∈ S has probability 2^{-{n \\choose 2}}.\" So that's the probability distribution. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The set S consists of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,…,n}.\n- The probability of selecting any graph G from S is 2^{-C(n,2)}.\n- The value of n approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here, the key points are:\n\n1. The vertex set is {1,2,…,n}.\n2. The random graph is selected from S with uniform probability (each edge is included independently with probability 1/2, which is the Erdős–Rényi model G(n, 1/2)). Wait, the problem states that the probability is 2^{-C(n,2)}, which is equivalent to each graph being equally likely, so uniform distribution. So maybe the assumption is that the random graph is selected uniformly from S.\n\nBut the original problem says \"A random graph G ∈ S has probability 2^{-{n \\choose 2}}.\" So that's an explicit assumption. So the first assumption is about S being the set of graphs with that vertex set, the second assumption is the probability distribution.\n\nThe problem is to show that as n approaches infinity, the probability that G is triangle-free approaches zero. So the problem is to prove that the probability of triangle-free graphs tends to zero as n tends to infinity.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vertex set of each graph is {1, 2, …, n},\nEach graph in S is assigned probability 2^{-{n \\choose 2}},\nn approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the probability that a random graph is triangle-free approaches zero.\n\nBut the original problem says \"a random graph almost surely contains a triangle\". So translating that into the problem statement, it's equivalent to showing that the probability of being triangle-free tends to zero.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Show that a random graph almost surely contains a triangle.\" The term \"almost surely\" in probability usually refers to an event occurring with probability 1. But in the context of asymptotic probability (as n approaches infinity), saying that the probability approaches 1 is equivalent to \"almost surely\" in the limit. So the problem is to show that the probability that G contains at least one triangle approaches 1 as n → ∞. Equivalently, the probability that G is triangle-free approaches 0.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem accordingly:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set S consists of all graphs with vertex set {1, 2, …, n},\nThe probability measure on S is uniform (each graph has probability 2^{-{n \\choose 2}}),\nThe problem considers the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the probability that a random graph from S is triangle-free approaches zero as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut to make each assumption line address one property applied to one object, let's split them:\n\nAssumption:\nEach graph in S has vertex set {1, 2, …, n},\nEach graph in S is chosen with probability 2^{-{n \\choose 2}},\nn is a positive integer approaching infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the probability of a random graph being triangle-free approaches zero.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nS is the set of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,…,n},\nEach graph G ∈ S has probability 2^{-{n \\choose 2}},\nThe problem considers n → ∞.\n\nProblem:\nShow that a random graph almost surely contains a triangle (i.e., the probability that G is triangle-free approaches 0 as n → ∞).\n\nBut the original problem's exact wording is \"Show that a random graph almost surely contains a triangle.\" So the problem statement should be phrased as in the original, but structured. The key is to capture the core problem after listing assumptions.\n\nIn the example, the problem statement was to prove the divisibility, with the assumptions about n being integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to show almost sure existence of a triangle, which under the assumptions (uniform probability, vertex set size n approaching infinity) becomes equivalent to showing the probability of triangle-free tends to zero.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\nS is the set of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,…,n},\nEach graph in S is assigned probability 2^{-{n \\choose 2}},\nThe problem considers the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that a random graph almost surely contains a triangle (i.e., the probability that G is triangle-free approaches 0).\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nBut checking the example again, the problem was restated more succinctly. Maybe in the problem line, just state the mathematical claim. So perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the probability that a random graph G ∈ S is triangle-free approaches 0 as n → ∞.\n\nBut the original problem says \"almost surely contains a triangle\", which is equivalent. So either phrasing is okay, but the example's problem line was the exact expression. Maybe use the original wording but make it precise.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's own attempt mentions \"the probability of a triangle-free graph goes to zero\", so the problem is to show that as n→infty, P(G is triangle-free) → 0.\n\nTherefore, combining all, the assumptions are:\n\n- The set S consists of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,…,n}.\n- The probability distribution on S is uniform (each graph has probability 2^{-C(n,2)}).\n- The problem is considered in the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Show that the probability that a random graph is triangle-free approaches zero as n approaches infinity.\n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nS is the set of all graphs with vertex set {1,2,…,n},\nEach graph in S is equally likely (probability 2^{-{n \\choose 2}}),\nn approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the probability of a random graph being triangle-free approaches zero.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is one line, each addressing a single property.",
