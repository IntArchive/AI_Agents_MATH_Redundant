    "Content": "Prove that any sequence of real numbers satisfying $a_{n+1}=|a_n|-a_{n-1}$ is periodic. Although it looks simple, I can't prove this statement... I tried rewriting the first few terms of the sequence, but nothing interesting showed up... I'd be mostly interested in hints for this one.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can handle the problem this way. Assume $a_0=a$ and $a_1=b$. The behaviour of the sequence always depends on the belonging of $(a,b)$ to one of the nine cones depicted below. By assuming, for example, that we starts with $(a,b)$ in the first cone ($a\\geq 0,a\\leq b\\leq 2a$), the sequence is:\n$$ a,b,b-a,-a,2a-b,3a-b,a,b-2a,a-b,a,b,b-a,\\ldots\\tag{2}$$\nand the period is $9$. By hand, we just have to check that this happens for any possible starting cone. Or be more clever. This is how the regions of the $(a,b)$-plane are mapped one into another: Starting in any point, we come back to that point in $9$ steps. To put in elegant terms, the map\n$$\\phi:(a,b)\\to(b,|b|-a)$$\nsends the $n$-th cone depicted in the $n+1$-th (the $9$th in the first one) with a bijection. Since the orbit of a point in the first cone is closed, the orbit of any point is closed, and its cardinality is nine.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that any sequence of real numbers defined by the recurrence relation a_{n+1} = |a_n| - a_{n-1} is periodic. The title and the question both mention this recurrence relation and the conclusion that the sequence must be periodic. \n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions line by line. The key here is that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me break down the problem's conditions:\n\n1. The sequence is of real numbers. So, each term a_n is a real number.\n2. The recurrence relation given is a_{n+1} = |a_n| - a_{n-1}. This defines how each term relates to the previous two terms.\n3. The problem states \"any sequence\" satisfying this recurrence, which implies there are no additional restrictions on the initial terms a_0 and a_1. However, since the problem says \"any sequence,\" the initial terms can be any real numbers, but the recurrence is fixed.\n\nWait, the problem says \"any sequence of real numbers satisfying...\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence (a_n) is defined for all n (assuming the sequence is infinite and the recurrence can be applied indefinitely).\n- Each term a_{n+1} is determined by the absolute value of the previous term minus the term before that.\n\nBut according to the example provided, assumptions should list conditions applied to one object each. Let me see the example again. The example had:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nSo each line is a separate condition on the same object. In the current problem, the main conditions are:\n\n1. The sequence (a_n) consists of real numbers.\n2. For all n, a_{n+1} = |a_n| - a_{n-1}.\n\nBut the problem says \"any sequence of real numbers satisfying a_{n+1} = |a_n| - a_{n-1} is periodic.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence is a sequence of real numbers.\n- The sequence satisfies the recurrence relation a_{n+1} = |a_n| - a_{n-1} for all n ≥ 1 (assuming n starts at 0 or 1? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's a general sequence, we can assume the recurrence holds for all applicable n).\n\nSo each assumption here is:\n\n1. The sequence (a_n) is composed of real numbers.\n2. For each n ≥ 1, a_{n+1} = |a_n| - a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key conditions are the sequence being real and satisfying the recurrence. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence (a_n) consists of real numbers,\nFor each n ≥ 1, a_{n+1} = |a_n| - a_{n-1}.\n\nBut the problem states \"any sequence of real numbers satisfying a_{n+1}=|a_n|-a_{n-1} is periodic.\" Therefore, the problem's assumptions are exactly those two points.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, is the sequence defined for all n? Probably, otherwise the periodicity wouldn't make sense. But maybe that's part of the definition of a sequence. Since the problem mentions \"any sequence,\" it's safe to assume that the sequence is defined for all n ≥ 0 or n ≥ 1, and the recurrence holds wherever applicable.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence (a_n) consists of real numbers,\nFor each n ≥ 1, a_{n+1} = |a_n| - a_{n-1}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (a_n) is periodic.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions on n. However, here the assumptions are about the sequence's terms and the recurrence relation. The user's example had two assumptions about n: being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are about the sequence's properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't need to list the sequence being real as an assumption because the original problem states \"any sequence of real numbers...\" So perhaps the assumption is that the sequence is of real numbers and satisfies the recurrence.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"the sequence consists of real numbers\" is one assumption, and \"the recurrence relation holds for all n\" is another.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence (a_n) is a sequence of real numbers,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, a_{n+1} = |a_n| - a_{n-1}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (a_n) is periodic.\n\nBut the original problem says \"any sequence of real numbers satisfying a_{n+1}=|a_n|-a_{n-1} is periodic.\" So perhaps the problem statement is to prove that such a sequence is periodic, given those two assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
