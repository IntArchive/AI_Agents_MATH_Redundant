    "Content": "I have been studying the sequence\n$$\\{n\\sqrt{2}\\}$$\nwhere $\\{x\\}:= x-\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the \"fractional part\" function. I am particularly interested in the values of $n$ for which $\\{n\\sqrt{2}\\}$ has an extremely small value - that is, when $n\\sqrt 2$ is extremely close to (but greater than) its nearest integer. Of course, for integer $n$, this always takes on values between (but never including) $0$ and $1$. I have defined the sequence $M_n$ as follows: $M_1=1$ $M_{n+1}$ is the smallest positive integer such that $\\{M_{n+1}\\sqrt 2\\}\\lt \\{M_n\\sqrt 2\\}$ The first few terms of this sequence are\n$$1,3,5,17,29,99,169,...$$\nAnd after a quick trip to the OEIS, I have found that this sequence is equal to OEIS entry A079496 , as written in the comments. It also provides the recurrence\n$$a_0=a_1=1$$\n$$a_{2n+1}=2a_{2n}-a_{2n-1}$$\n$$a_{2n}=4a_{2n-1}-a_{2n-2}$$\nHow can I prove that the sequence $M_n$ satisfies this recurrence, using the definition I wrote for $M_n$?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Summary of solution : the originality of your question consists in its use of \nthe floor function to round, when most of the classical results on continued fractions use\nthe nearest integer function. The idea is to reduce the former to the latter. Details : Let $M_n,a_n$ be as in the OP. Our goal is to show that $$\nM_n=a_n \\tag{1}\n$$ As a convenience, let us use the \"normalized\" number $\\alpha=\\sqrt{2}-1$ (which is in the unit interval) rather than $\\sqrt{2}$ itself. It will suffice to show : $$\n\\lbrace q\\alpha \\rbrace \\geq \\lbrace a_n\\alpha \\rbrace \n\\textrm{ for } 0 \\lt q \\lt a_{n+1} \\tag{2}\n$$ We will use a sequence closely related to the continued fraction expansion of $\\alpha$, namely $g_n=\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^n-(1-\\sqrt{2})^n}{2\\sqrt{2}}$. Note that $(g_n)$ satisfies \n$g_0=0,g_1=1$ and $g_{n+2}-2g_{n+1}+g_n=0$, so its values (after $g_1$) are positive integers. The following properties are easy to show by a direct computation or by induction : $(i)$ $g_ng_{n+2}-g_{n+1}^2=(-1)^{n+1}$ $(ii)$ $a_n=g_n$ when $n$ is odd $(iii)$ $a_n=g_{n+1}-g_n$ when $n$ is even $(iv)$ $\\frac{g_n-g_{n+1}\\alpha}{g_{n+1}-g_{n+2}\\alpha}=1-\\sqrt{2}$ $(v)$ $\\frac{a_{n+2}\\alpha -(g_{n+2}-g_{n+1})}{a_n\\alpha -(g_n-g_{n-1})}=3-2\\sqrt{2}$,\nwhen $n$ is even. The following lemma is a very classic continued fraction inequality : LEMMA. Let $p,q$ be integers with $0 \\lt q \\lt g_{n+2}$. Then $|p-q\\alpha| \\geq |g_n-g_{n+1}\\alpha|$. Further, if  $(p,q)\\neq (g_n,g_{n+1})$, the inequality can be strenghtened to $|p-q\\alpha| \\geq |g_n-g_{n+1}\\alpha|+|g_{n+1}-g_{n+2}\\alpha|$. Proof of lemma. By (i),  the matrix $\\left(\\begin{matrix} g_n & g_{n+1} \\\\ g_{n+1} & g_{n+2} \\end{matrix}\\right)$ is unimodular. It follows that there are integers $u,v$ such that $p=g_n u+g_{n+1}v$ and $q=g_{n+1}u+g_{n+2}v$. I claim that $uv\\leq 0$ ; otherwise, $g_{n+1}u$ and $g_{n+2}v$ would both be nonzero and have the same sign, forcing $|q| = |g_{n+1}u|+|g_{n+2}v| \\geq |g_{n+2}|$ which is impossible. So $uv\\leq 0$, and also $$\np-q\\alpha= u(g_n-g_{n+1}\\alpha) + v (g_{n+1}-g_{n+2}\\alpha) \\tag{3}\n$$ The numbers $u(g_n-g_{n+1}\\alpha)$ and $v(g_{n+1}-g_{n+2}\\alpha)$ have the same sign, so $$\n|p-q\\alpha|= |u(g_n-g_{n+1}\\alpha)| + |v (g_{n+1}-g_{n+2}\\alpha)| \\tag{4}\n$$ Note that $u\\neq 0$ because of $q=g_{n+1}u+g_{n+2}v$ and $|q|<g_{n+2}$. So $|u|\\geq 1$ and the first inequality follows. If equality holds, we must have $|u|=1$ and $v=0$, from which we easily deduce $(p,q)=(g_n,g_{n+1})$. Suppose now that $(p,q)\\neq (g_n,g_{n+1})$. If $|u|\\geq 2$, then from (4) we deduce $|p-q\\alpha| \\geq 2|g_n-g_{n+1}\\alpha|$. By (iv), the second inequality holds in this case. Otherwise $u=1$ and from the reasoning above we have $v\\neq 0$, so $|v|\\geq 1$ and from (4) again we deduce $|p-q\\alpha| \\geq |g_n-g_{n+1}\\alpha|+|g_{n+1}-g_{n+2}\\alpha|$, which finishes the proof of the lemma. Let us now deduce (2) from the lemma. Suppose first that $n$ is odd. By $(ii)$, $\\lbrace a_n\\alpha \\rbrace=\\lbrace g_n\\alpha \\rbrace=g_{n+1}\\alpha-g_n$ by lemma, (iv) and the fact that $g_{n+1}\\alpha-g_n >0$.\nThe lemma also shows that $\\lbrace q \\alpha \\rbrace \\geq \\lbrace a_n \\alpha \\rbrace$\nfor $0 \\lt q \\lt g_{n+2}=a_{n+2}$, as wished. Suppose now that $n$ is even. Using the lemma with $n-1$ in place of $n$, we have that for any $0 \\lt q \\lt g_{n+1}=a_{n+1}$ and $(p,q)\\neq (g_{n-1},g_n)$, then \n$$\\begin{array}{lcl}\n|p-q\\alpha| &\\geq& |g_{n-1}-g_{n}\\alpha|+|g_{n}-g_{n+1}\\alpha| \\\\\n            &=& g_{n-1}-g_{n}\\alpha+g_{n+1}\\alpha-g_n \\\\\n            &=& a_n\\alpha -(g_n-g_{n-1}) \\\\\n            &=& \\lbrace a_n \\alpha \\rbrace \\textrm{ by } (v)\n\\end{array}$$ This finishes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the sequence M_n, defined by starting with M_1=1 and each subsequent term being the smallest positive integer such that the fractional part of M_{n+1} times sqrt(2) is less than the fractional part of M_n times sqrt(2), satisfies a specific recurrence relation from OEIS A079496. The recurrence is given with even and odd cases. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the original problem. The sequence {n√2} is the fractional part, so each term is between 0 and 1. The user defines M_n such that each term is the smallest integer making the fractional part smaller than the previous. The recurrence provided has different cases for even and odd indices. The initial terms match the OEIS entry, which gives a recurrence relation. The user wants a proof that their sequence M_n satisfies this recurrence.\n\nThe assumptions need to be listed. The problem mentions M_1=1, the definition of M_{n+1} as the smallest positive integer with {M_{n+1}√2} < {M_n√2}, and the recurrence relations for a_0, a_1, and the even and odd terms. The OEIS entry's recurrence is part of the problem's given information, so those should be the assumptions. The user might have made an error in assuming the sequence matches the OEIS, but since they state it's equal, we take that as given.\n\nWait, the problem says \"prove that the sequence M_n satisfies this recurrence\". So the assumptions are the definitions of M_n, the initial terms, and the recurrence relations from OEIS. Wait, no—the problem is to show that the user's defined sequence (with M_1=1 and the minimality condition) satisfies the given recurrence. So the recurrence is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions should be the definitions provided by the user: M_1=1, M_{n+1} is the smallest integer such that the fractional part is less than the previous, and the recurrence relations are part of what needs to be proven. Hmm, but the problem statement includes the recurrence as part of the problem. So the user is asking to prove that their M_n satisfies that recurrence. Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions of M_n and the initial terms, and the problem is to show the recurrence holds. But in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. So in this case, the assumptions would include the definitions given for the sequence M_n. \n\nLooking back at the example: the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the format is: list all the given conditions as assumptions. Here, the problem states that M_1=1, M_{n+1} is defined as the smallest positive integer with fractional part less than the previous. Also, the recurrence relations are provided in the problem statement as part of the OEIS entry. Wait, the user is saying that they found the sequence matches OEIS A079496, which has this recurrence. So the problem is to prove that their sequence M_n (defined via the fractional parts) satisfies the given recurrence. Therefore, the assumptions would be the definitions of the sequence M_n (M_1=1, the condition on M_{n+1}), and the problem is to prove that the recurrence holds. But the user also mentions the initial terms (1,3,5,17,...) and the closed-form formulas. But the problem specifically asks to prove that M_n satisfies the recurrence. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list the definition of M_n, the initial terms (M_1=1), and the recurrence relations given in the OEIS entry. Wait, no: the problem is to show that the sequence as defined (M_n) satisfies the recurrence. So the recurrence is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are the definition of the sequence M_n. The problem statement is \"Prove that the sequence M_n satisfies the recurrence...\". So the assumptions would be:\n\n- M_1 = 1\n- For each n, M_{n+1} is the smallest positive integer such that {M_{n+1}√2} < {M_n√2}\n- The sequence {M_n} starts with 1, 3, 5, 17, 29, 99, 169, ...\n  \nBut in the example, the assumptions were the conditions given in the original problem. So here, the original problem defines the sequence with M_1=1, the minimality condition for M_{n+1}, and the OEIS recurrence is part of what needs to be proven. Therefore, the assumptions should include the initial terms, the definition of M_n, and the problem is to prove the recurrence. However, the user might be assuming that the sequence matches the OEIS, but they need to prove the recurrence. The problem is to show that the user's sequence (defined by the fractional part condition) satisfies the OEIS recurrence. Hence, the assumptions are:\n\n- M_1 = 1\n- For each positive integer n, M_{n+1} is the smallest positive integer such that {M_{n+1}√2} < {M_n√2}\n- The fractional part {x} is defined as x - floor(x)\n\nBut maybe also the initial terms, but the problem states that the first few terms are 1,3,5,17,... which are part of the problem's given data. So the assumptions would include the definition of M_n and the initial terms. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the recurrence, the initial terms are part of the base cases. But in the example, the original problem included \"for every integer n\", and an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So here, the user is providing that M_n is defined in a certain way, and the problem is to prove that it satisfies the recurrence. Therefore, the assumptions should list all given conditions and definitions necessary to state the problem.\n\nSo, compiling the assumptions:\n\n- M_1 = 1\n- For each positive integer n, M_{n+1} is the smallest positive integer such that {M_{n+1}√2} < {M_n√2}\n- {x} denotes the fractional part of x, defined as x - floor(x)\n- The sequence M_n starts with terms 1, 3, 5, 17, 29, 99, 169, ...\n- The recurrence relations to be proven are:\n  - a_0 = a_1 = 1\n  - For n ≥ 0, a_{2n+1} = 2a_{2n} - a_{2n-1}\n  - For n ≥ 1, a_{2n} = 4a_{2n-1} - a_{2n-2}\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions a_0 and a_1 as 1, but the user's sequence starts with M_1=1. There might be a shift in indexing. The user's sequence M_n starts at n=1, but the OEIS entry has a_0 and a_1 both as 1. The initial terms given by the user are 1,3,5,... which correspond to a_1=1, a_2=3, a_3=5, etc., perhaps. So there's a need to reconcile the indices. However, the problem statement says that the sequence M_n is equal to OEIS A079496, which has a_0=a_1=1, but the user's sequence starts with M_1=1, then M_2=3, etc. So maybe a_1 in the OEIS corresponds to M_1. But this is a detail that might be part of the problem's assumptions. However, the user's main question is to prove that their sequence satisfies the recurrence, so the key assumptions are the definition of M_n and the recurrence to be proven. The problem statement includes the recurrence as part of what needs to be proven, so perhaps the assumptions should list the definition of M_n and the initial terms. The problem is then to show that this sequence satisfies the recurrence. \n\nBut the example given by the user in the original problem had assumptions listed as the conditions given, and the problem as what needs to be proven. So here, the user's problem is: given that M_n is defined as per the minimal fractional part condition, starting with M_1=1, and the recurrence from OEIS, prove that M_n satisfies this recurrence. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- M_1 = 1\n- For each n ≥ 1, M_{n+1} is the smallest positive integer such that {M_{n+1}√2} < {M_n√2}\n- The fractional part {x} is x - floor(x)\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sequence M_n satisfies the recurrence relations given (for a_0=a_1=1, and the even/odd terms). However, since the OEIS entry has a_0=1 and a_1=1, but the user's sequence starts at M_1=1, there might be an index shift. The user's sequence M_n corresponds to a_n in the OEIS starting from n=1. But perhaps in the problem statement, the user has adjusted the indices, so that their M_n is the same as the OEIS's a_n. Given that the user provides the first few terms as 1,3,5,17,... which matches the OEIS entry starting from a_1=1, a_2=3, a_3=5, etc., assuming that the OEIS entry's a_n starts at n=1. However, the OEIS entry actually starts at n=0 with a_0=1, a_1=1, a_2=3, etc. But in the user's sequence, the first term is 1, then 3, which would correspond to a_1=1, a_2=3, so there's an index shift. This might be a source of confusion, but the problem statement says that the sequence is equal to the OEIS entry, so we can assume that the user has adjusted the indices accordingly. Therefore, the recurrence relations provided by the user (for a_0=a_1=1 and the even/odd terms) must be proven for their sequence M_n, possibly with adjusted indices. \n\nGiven all this, the assumptions should include the definition of the sequence M_n (M_1=1, the minimality condition), and the problem is to prove that this sequence satisfies the given recurrence relations. The initial terms are part of the problem's given data but might not need to be listed as assumptions unless required. However, in the example provided, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's condition. So here, the key assumptions are the definition of M_n and the initial term. The recurrence relations are part of what needs to be proven. Therefore, the formatted problem should list as assumptions the conditions given for defining the sequence, and the problem is to prove the recurrence. \n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- M_1 = 1\n- For each positive integer n, M_{n+1} is the smallest positive integer such that {M_{n+1}√2} < {M_n√2}\n- {x} denotes the fractional part of x, defined as x - floor(x)\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the sequence M_n satisfies the recurrence relations:\n\n- a_0 = a_1 = 1\n- For n ≥ 0, a_{2n+1} = 2a_{2n} - a_{2n-1}\n- For n ≥ 1, a_{2n} = 4a_{2n-1} - a_{2n-2}\n\nBut here, there's a discrepancy because the user's sequence starts at M_1=1, while the recurrence includes a_0=1. The user's sequence may have a_0=1 as part of the recurrence's initial condition, but their M_n starts at n=1. This could be a point of confusion. However, since the problem statement from the user says that the sequence is equal to the OEIS entry, which includes a_0=1, perhaps the user's sequence M_n is indexed starting from n=1, but the OEIS entry starts from n=0. Therefore, to align the indices, M_n corresponds to a_{n} in the OEIS starting from n=1. But the recurrence in the OEIS includes a_0 and a_1. This needs to be clarified, but the problem as posed by the user includes the recurrence with a_0=a_1=1, so the formatted problem should include the necessary assumptions to state the recurrence. However, since the user's sequence starts at M_1=1, perhaps the problem is to show that their sequence (starting at n=1) satisfies the recurrence for n ≥1, adjusting the indices accordingly. \n\nGiven all that, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\n- M_1 = 1\n- For each positive integer n, M_{n+1} is the smallest positive integer such that {M_{n+1}√2} < {M_n√2}\n- {x} denotes the fractional part of x, defined as x - floor(x)\n- The sequence M_n corresponds to OEIS A079496 with a_0 = a_1 = 1\n\nBut the last point is part of the problem's given, as the user states they found the sequence equals the OEIS entry. However, the problem is to prove the recurrence, so the assumptions should only include what is given, not what needs to be proven. Therefore, the recurrence relations are part of the problem statement. \n\nWait, the problem is: \"How can I prove that the sequence M_n satisfies this recurrence, using the definition I wrote for M_n?\" So the user is providing that M_n is defined as per their conditions, and they want to prove that it satisfies the recurrence from OEIS. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- M_1 = 1\n- For each positive integer n, M_{n+1} is the smallest positive integer such that {M_{n+1}√2} < {M_n√2}\n- {x} denotes the fractional part of x, defined as x - floor(x)\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sequence M_n satisfies the recurrence relations:\n\n- a_0 = a_1 = 1\n- For n ≥ 0, a_{2n+1} = 2a_{2n} - a_{2n-1}\n- For n ≥ 1, a_{2n} = 4a_{2n-1} - a_{2n-2}\n\nBut the initial terms of the user's sequence start at M_1=1, which corresponds to a_1=1 in the OEIS entry (assuming a_0=1). However, the user's sequence has M_1=1, M_2=3, M_3=5, etc., which in the OEIS would be a_1=1, a_2=3, a_3=5, etc., but the OEIS entry actually starts with a_0=1, a_1=1, a_2=3, a_3=5, etc. This index shift is important. Therefore, there's a possible misalignment in the indices. The user's M_n corresponds to a_{n} in the OEIS starting at n=1, but the OEIS has a_0=1. This might be causing confusion, but the user states that their sequence is equal to the OEIS entry, so perhaps they adjusted the indices. \n\nIn any case, the formatted problem should capture the essence: the user-defined sequence M_n with certain properties needs to be shown to satisfy a given recurrence. The assumptions are the definition of M_n and the problem is to prove the recurrence. Therefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- M_1 = 1\n- For each positive integer n, M_{n+1} is the smallest positive integer such that {M_{n+1}√2} < {M_n√2}\n- {x} denotes the fractional part of x, defined as x - floor(x)\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence M_n satisfies the recurrence relations:\n- a_0 = a_1 = 1\n- For n ≥ 0, a_{2n+1} = 2a_{2n} - a_{2n-1}\n- For n ≥ 1, a_{2n} = 4a_{2n-1} - a_{2n-2}\n\nHowever, the problem mentions a_0 and a_1, but the user's sequence starts at M_1. This suggests that the indices need to be adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps the user's M_n corresponds to a_n in the OEIS starting from n=1, so a_1=1, a_2=3, etc. But the recurrence given in the problem includes a_0=a_1=1, which would mean that M_1=1 is a_1, and a_0=1 is an additional term. This might complicate things, but the user is likely referring to the sequence starting at n=1 with M_1=1, so the recurrence needs to be adjusted accordingly. However, since the problem statement includes the recurrence as part of the OEIS entry, and the user wants to prove their sequence satisfies it, the formatted problem should include the recurrence as part of the problem statement, even if the indexing is off. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the indexing, and the correct assumptions should align the indices properly. However, without further information, we must follow what the user provided. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions as the definition of M_n and the problem as proving the recurrence given, including the initial terms a_0=a_1=1. \n\nBut the user's sequence starts at M_1=1, which they might consider as a_1. If the OEIS entry has a_0=1 and a_1=1, then the user's M_1=1 corresponds to a_1=1, and the OEIS entry's a_0=1 is an extra term not in the user's sequence. This complicates the recurrence relations, but since the user says their sequence is equal to the OEIS entry, perhaps the indices are shifted. \n\nGiven all this, I think the best approach is to list the assumptions as per the user's definition of M_n, and the problem is to prove the given recurrence relations, assuming that M_n corresponds to the OEIS sequence's terms starting from a certain index. The exact indexing might be part of the proof, but in the formatted problem, we just present the assumptions and the problem as stated.",
