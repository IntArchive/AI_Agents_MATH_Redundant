    "Content": "It appears to be the case that the epimorphisms in $\\text{Haus}$ are precisely the maps with dense image. This is claimed in various places, but a comment on my blog has made me doubt the source I got my proof from (Borceux). Borceux's argument crucially uses the following result: If $A \\subset X$ is a closed subspace of a Hausdorff space $X$, then the quotient $X/A$ is Hausdorff. This appears to be false. As far as I can tell, if $X/A$ is Hausdorff, then $A$ and points in $X$ not in $A$ must be separated by open neighborhoods in $X$. But if this is true for every closed subspace $A$ of $X$, then $X$ is necessarily regular, and there are examples of Hausdorff spaces that aren't regular. So: is it still true that the epimorphisms are precisely the maps with dense image? If so, what is a correct proof of this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, according to Herrlich & Strecker, Section 6.10(4). Here’s the argument: If $A\\overset{f}\\longrightarrow B$ is an epimorphism, let $C$ be the disjoint topological union of two ‘copies’ of $B$ where the corresponding points of the closure of $f[A]$ have been identified, and let $h$ and $k$ be the two natural maps from $B$ to $C$. That’s as far as they actually write it out, but clearly the rest is that $h\\circ f=k\\circ f$, and $f$ is an epimorphism, so $h=k$, and $f[A]$ must therefore be dense in $B$. Added: To see that $C$ is actually Hausdorff, let the copies of $B$ be $B_0=B\\times\\{0\\}$ and $B_1=B\\times\\{1\\}$, let $K=\\operatorname{cl}f[A]$, and let $K_i=K\\times\\{i\\}$ for $i\\in\\{0,1\\}$. Finally, let $q:B_0\\sqcup B_1\\to C$ be the quotient map. Clearly $q(\\langle x,i\\rangle)$ and $q(\\langle y,j\\rangle)$ can be separated by disjoint open sets in $C$ whenever $x\\ne y$, irrespective of $i$ and $j$. If $q(\\langle x,0\\rangle)\\ne q(\\langle x,1\\rangle)$, then $x\\in B\\setminus K$, an open subset of $B$, so $q[B_0\\setminus K_0]$ and $q[B_1\\setminus K_1]$ are disjoint open nbhds of $q(\\langle x,0\\rangle)$ and $q(\\langle x,1\\rangle)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the core problem. \n\nThe original question is about epimorphisms in the category of Hausdorff spaces (Haus). The user mentions a claim that epimorphisms are maps with dense images, but there's a problem with Borceux's proof using the quotient space X/A being Hausdorff when A is closed. They argue that this might not hold because X would need to be regular, which isn't always the case.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are about the category being Hausdorff spaces, the definition of epimorphisms in this category, and the conditions under which quotient spaces remain Hausdorff. The problem is to verify whether epimorphisms are indeed the maps with dense images and provide a correct proof if so.\n\nI need to list each assumption clearly, each on its own line. The problem statement should then be the main question. Let me check the example again to make sure I'm following the format correctly. In the example, assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove divisibility. Similarly here, the assumptions should relate to the properties of Hausdorff spaces, the definition of epimorphisms, and perhaps the issue with the quotient space. But the original problem doesn't state all assumptions explicitly; some are part of the context. So I need to extract those.\n\nAssumptions would include: working in the category of Hausdorff spaces (Haus), epimorphisms are defined as morphisms right-cancellable, the quotient X/A for closed A in Hausdorff X is Hausdorff (which is contested), and that the user questions this. Wait, but the user is doubting Borceux's use of X/A being Hausdorff. So maybe the assumption that X/A is Hausdorff when A is closed in X (a Hausdorff space) is incorrect. But how to phrase the assumptions?\n\nAlternatively, the problem's core is whether epimorphisms in Haus are maps with dense image, given that Borceux's proof might be flawed because it relies on X/A being Hausdorff, which may not hold unless X is regular. So the assumptions would include the category is Hausdorff spaces, and the problem is to prove epimorphisms are maps with dense image despite the potential issue with Borceux's argument. Wait, but the problem isn't adding new conditions, it's questioning the existing claim. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. Working in the category of Hausdorff spaces.\n2. Epimorphisms are morphisms that are right-cancellable.\n3. The quotient space X/A is Hausdorff if A is a closed subspace of Hausdorff space X. (But this is contested as it may require X to be regular.)\n\nBut the problem is to verify whether epimorphisms are indeed maps with dense image, given that the original proof might be incorrect. However, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were specific conditions on the problem's variables. Here, the assumptions are more about the category's properties and prior results. But according to the format, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me see.\n\nThe user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is in the category of Hausdorff spaces, and the question is about characterizing epimorphisms. The user is pointing out a potential flaw in a proof, so perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- The category under consideration is Haus (Hausdorff spaces).\n- Borceux's proof uses that for any closed subspace A of X (Hausdorff), the quotient X/A is Hausdorff.\n- However, if X/A is Hausdorff, then X must be regular, which is not always true for Hausdorff spaces.\n  \nBut the problem is asking whether epimorphisms are still the maps with dense image despite this issue in the proof. But how to structure this into assumptions and the problem.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions would be the properties that the category is Hausdorff spaces, and that epimorphisms are defined as right-cancellable morphisms. The problem is to determine if epimorphisms are precisely the maps with dense image, given the potential flaw in the original proof.\n\nWait, maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The category is Hausdorff spaces.\n2. A map is an epimorphism if it is right-cancellable.\n3. The original proof claims that epimorphisms are maps with dense image, using that X/A is Hausdorff for closed A in X.\n4. However, X/A being Hausdorff may require X to be regular, which isn't always true.\n\nBut the problem is to verify the claim and provide a correct proof. However, the user's example didn't include assumptions about the proof being wrong, only mathematical conditions. So perhaps the problem is to prove that in the category of Hausdorff spaces, epimorphisms are the maps with dense image, given that a previous approach had a flawed assumption about quotient spaces. But how to phrase that.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is as stated: \"Is it still true that the epimorphisms are precisely the maps with dense image? If so, what is a correct proof of this?\" So the assumptions here would be the context of the category of Hausdorff spaces, and the contested step in Borceux's proof. But according to the format, the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The category under consideration is Hausdorff topological spaces.\n- Epimorphisms in a category are morphisms that are right-cancellable.\n- A closed subspace $A$ of a Hausdorff space $X$ implies the quotient $X/A$ is Hausdorff. (This is contested as it may require $X$ to be regular.)\n- There exist Hausdorff spaces that are not regular.\n\nProblem: Determine whether the epimorphisms in the category of Hausdorff spaces are precisely the continuous maps with dense image. If true, provide a correct proof.\n\nBut the original question is asking to confirm if the epimorphisms are indeed maps with dense image, given the problem with Borceux's proof. So structuring this, the key assumptions are about the category being Hausdorff, the definition of epimorphisms, the claim about quotient spaces, and the existence of non-regular Hausdorff spaces. Then the problem is to verify the initial claim.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is a single line, one property or condition per line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe category is Hausdorff topological spaces.\nEpimorphisms are defined as right-cancellable morphisms.\nBorceux's proof uses that for a closed subspace $A$ of Hausdorff $X$, the quotient $X/A$ is Hausdorff.\nIf $X/A$ is Hausdorff, then $A$ and points not in $A$ are separated by open neighborhoods in $X$.\nA Hausdorff space $X$ where every closed subspace $A$ allows $X/A$ to be Hausdorff must be regular.\nThere exist Hausdorff spaces that are not regular.\n\nProblem: Is it true that the epimorphisms in the category of Hausdorff spaces are precisely the continuous maps with dense image? If so, provide a correct proof.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are part of the problem's context rather than assumptions. The user is questioning whether the original proof's reliance on X/A being Hausdorff is valid, given that X might not be regular. So the key assumptions for the problem are:\n\n- Working in the category of Hausdorff spaces.\n- Epimorphisms are right-cancellable.\n- The original proof's step that X/A is Hausdorff for closed A is flawed because it implies X is regular, which isn't always true.\n\nBut the problem is to determine if the conclusion still holds despite that. However, according to the format, assumptions should be the problem's given conditions, not the context of the proof. The user's question is whether, in the category of Hausdorff spaces, epimorphisms are the maps with dense image, given that a certain step in a proof might be incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The category is Hausdorff topological spaces.\n- A continuous map $f: X \\to Y$ in this category is an epimorphism if it is right-cancellable.\n- There exist Hausdorff spaces that are not regular.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the epimorphisms in the category of Hausdorff spaces are precisely the continuous maps with dense image.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that the category is Hausdorff spaces, and the problem is the question. The other points are part of the problem's context but not assumptions per se. But according to the example, the assumptions were specific conditions on n. So in this case, the main assumption is that we're working in the category of Hausdorff spaces, and the problem is to characterize epimorphisms. However, the user's doubt comes from a specific argument, but that might not be an assumption but part of the problem's motivation.\n\nWait, the example given by the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So the assumptions were the conditions on n, and the problem was the main statement.\n\nIn the current case, the question is about epimorphisms in Hausdorff spaces. The assumptions would be the properties of the category and any given conditions. However, the user hasn't added any new conditions but is questioning an existing proof. So perhaps the only assumption is that we're working in the category of Hausdorff spaces, and the problem is to determine whether epimorphisms are maps with dense image.\n\nBut the user mentions that Borceux's argument uses that X/A is Hausdorff for closed A, which the user doubts. So maybe the assumption is that X/A might not be Hausdorff even if A is closed, which affects the proof. However, this is part of the problem's context rather than an assumption of the problem itself.\n\nI think the core assumptions here are:\n\n1. The category under consideration is Hausdorff topological spaces.\n2. Epimorphisms are defined as right-cancellable morphisms.\n\nProblem: Prove that the epimorphisms in this category are precisely the continuous maps with dense image, despite the potential flaw in Borceux's proof regarding the Hausdorff property of quotient spaces.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption is a single line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe category is Hausdorff topological spaces.\nEpimorphisms are right-cancellable morphisms.\nProblem: Prove that the epimorphisms in the category of Hausdorff spaces are precisely the continuous maps with dense image.\n\nBut the user's issue is that Borceux's proof uses a questionable step. However, the problem as posed is whether the characterization holds, given that the original proof may have a flaw. But in the example, the assumption was about n being divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem is more about the category's properties, not specific to a particular space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correctly formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe category considered is Hausdorff topological spaces.\nProblem: Determine whether the epimorphisms in this category are precisely the continuous maps with dense image. If so, provide a correct proof.\n\nBut the user's original question includes doubts about the quotient space argument. However, in the example, the original problem had an expression and an assumption about n's divisibility. The formatted problem listed the assumptions and the problem. So perhaps the key here is that the problem is to prove the statement, and the assumptions are the necessary conditions. The user's doubt about the quotient space is part of the problem's context but not an assumption.\n\nSo, following the example, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe category is Hausdorff topological spaces.\nProblem: Prove that the epimorphisms in this category are precisely the continuous maps with dense image.\n\nBut the user's question mentions that Borceux's proof uses a claim that might be false. However, the problem remains the same: prove the characterization. The assumptions are the category and the definition of epimorphisms. The rest is part of the problem's context. So in the example, the user had to include the divisibility by 7 as an assumption because it was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the category is the main assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe category is Hausdorff topological spaces.\nEpimorphisms are defined as morphisms that are right-cancellable.\nProblem: Prove that a continuous map in the category of Hausdorff spaces is an epimorphism if and only if it has a dense image.\n\nBut the user's question also asks for a correct proof given the issue with Borceux's approach. However, according to the format, the problem should be stated concisely, and assumptions should be specific conditions. Since the example included the specific divisibility condition, here the assumption is the category and epimorphism definition.\n\nWait, the example's assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted version added it. Wait, no: looking back, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, no, the example might have been altered. Let me check:\n\nThe original problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nThe formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Maybe the original problem had n divisible by 7, but the user restructured it. Wait, this is confusing. The example might have been a mistake by the user. If the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should not include n divisible by 7. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps the example was a different problem where the original problem had n divisible by 7, but it's unclear. Anyway, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct way is to list the main assumptions necessary for the problem. The problem is about epimorphisms in the category of Hausdorff spaces. The user wants to know if they are the maps with dense image, given that a certain step in a proof might be flawed.\n\nBut according to the format, the assumptions are the problem's given conditions. The user's question is whether the characterization holds, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- Working in the category of Hausdorff spaces.\n- The definition of epimorphisms (right-cancellable).\n\nThe problem is to prove that these epimorphisms are maps with dense image.\n\nSo, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nThe category is Hausdorff topological spaces.\nEpimorphisms are right-cancellable morphisms.\nProblem: Prove that the epimorphisms in the category of Hausdorff spaces are precisely the continuous maps with dense image.\n\nBut the user's doubt about the quotient space being Hausdorff is part of the problem's background, not an assumption. The example given by the user might have included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, but perhaps that was a mistake. In this case, the original problem's assumptions are just the category and epimorphism definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has an implicit assumption that the maps in question are continuous, since we're in the category of Hausdorff spaces where morphisms are continuous functions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe category consists of Hausdorff topological spaces with continuous maps as morphisms.\nEpimorphisms are defined as morphisms that are right-cancellable.\nProblem: Prove that a continuous map in this category is an epimorphism if and only if it has a dense image.\n\nThis seems more precise. Each assumption is a single line: the category, the definition of epimorphisms. The problem is to prove the characterization.\n\nBut the user's question also mentions that Borceux's proof uses a result that may be false, leading to doubt. However, in the formatted problem, this is part of the problem's context, not the assumptions. The task is to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated information. The user's original question includes a lot of discussion about Borceux's proof and quotient spaces, but the core problem is the characterization of epimorphisms.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture the essential assumptions and the main question. The user wants to know if epimorphisms are maps with dense image, given the potential flaw in the proof. However, according to the example, the formatted problem should list assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions here are the category and the definition of epimorphisms, and the problem is to prove the characterization.",
