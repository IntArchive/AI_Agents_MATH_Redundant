    "AcceptedAnswer": "The desired estimate holds at $\\theta=0$ and we have\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\cos(\\sin\\theta)-\\sin(\\cos\\theta)\n&=&\n\\cos(\\sin\\theta)-\\cos\\left(\\frac\\pi2-\\cos\\theta\\right)\n\\\\&=&\n2\\sin\\left(\\frac12\\left(\\frac\\pi2-\\cos\\theta-\\sin\\theta\\right)\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac12\\left(\\frac\\pi2-\\cos\\theta+\\sin\\theta\\right)\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nso it suffices to show that $\\frac\\pi2-\\cos\\theta\\pm\\sin\\theta\\neq0$ for all $\\theta$ for both signs. Let $f_\\pm(x)=\\frac\\pi2-\\cos x\\pm\\sin x$.\nNow $f'_\\pm(x)=\\sin x\\pm\\cos x$, so at extremal points of $f_\\pm$ we have $\\sin x=\\mp\\cos x$.\nThis equation can be solved, and the corresponding values give the minimum value $\\frac\\pi2-\\sqrt2>0$ for both functions.\nSince $f_\\pm(0)>0$, we have $f_\\pm(x)>0$ for all $x$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows breaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nThe problem in question is from Math Stack Exchange: \"For all real θ prove that cos(sinθ) > sin(cosθ)\". The title is the problem statement. The user's question is asking for help to prove it, mentioning they can't even start.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"for all real θ\", so the first assumption is that θ is a real number. There's no other condition mentioned, like θ being in a specific interval or any other constraints. The problem is to prove the inequality cos(sinθ) > sin(cosθ) holds for all real θ.\n\nWait, but should there be more assumptions? Let me double-check. The original problem doesn't mention any restrictions beyond θ being real. So the only assumption is that θ is a real number. The problem is to prove that inequality for all such θ. \n\nI need to ensure each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property. Since θ is real, that's one line. There's no other separate condition here. The example had two assumptions because the original problem had n as an integer and n divisible by 7. But here, the original problem only states θ is real. Therefore, the assumptions section should list \"θ is a real number\" as the sole assumption.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that cos(sinθ) > sin(cosθ).\n\nI think that's it. Let me check if there's any hidden assumption. The inequality is comparing cos(sinθ) and sin(cosθ). Do we need to assume anything about the functions themselves? Probably not, since cosine and sine are defined for all real numbers. So θ being real is the only necessary assumption here. \n\nYes, that seems correct. The example given had two assumptions because the original problem had two conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, only one condition is given. So the formatted problem should be as above.",
