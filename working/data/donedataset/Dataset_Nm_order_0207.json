    "Content": "Given: $a = qb + r$ . Then it holds that $\\gcd(a,b)=\\gcd(b,r)$ . That doesn't sound logical to me. Why is this so? Addendum by LePressentiment on 11/29/2013: (in the interest of http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/a/4110/53259 and averting a duplicate) What's the intuition behind this result? I only recognise the proof and examples solely due to algebraic properties and formal definitions; I'd like to apprehend the result naturally.",

Generally the set of multiples of $\\rm\\,d\\,$ are closed under integral linear combinations , and ditto for common multiples of any set of integers, which leads to the universal property of the lcm , using descent via the Euclidean division algorithm. Many of the above properties also hold for ideals , and we can give unified proofs for both .

The set of all such fractions forms a ring $\\rm\\,Z\\,$ of $2$ -integral fractions. Moreover, this ring enjoys parity, so arguments based upon even/odd arithmetic go through. Similar ideas lead to powerful local-global techniques of reducing divisibility problems from complicated \"global\" rings to simpler \"local\" rings, where divisibility is decided by simply comparing powers of a prime.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking why the gcd of (b, qb + r) is the same as the gcd of (b, r). They mentioned the equation a = qb + r, so I guess that's the division algorithm where a is divided by b, giving quotient q and remainder r. The problem is to show that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). \n\nFirst, I need to recall what gcd means. The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without a remainder. So, if we can show that the set of common divisors of a and b is the same as the set of common divisors of b and r, then their gcds must be equal. \n\nLet me start by letting d be a common divisor of b and r. Then d divides b and d divides r. If d divides b, then it also divides qb because that's just a multiple of b. And since d divides both qb and r, it should divide their sum, which is qb + r. But qb + r is equal to a. So d divides a and d divides b, which means d is a common divisor of a and b. \n\nConversely, if d is a common divisor of a and b, then d divides a and d divides b. Since a = qb + r, we can rearrange that to r = a - qb. Since d divides a and d divides qb, then d must divide their difference, which is r. Therefore, d divides both b and r, making it a common divisor of b and r. \n\nThis shows that the common divisors of (a, b) and (b, r) are the same, so their greatest common divisor must be the same. Therefore, gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). \n\nFor the intuition part, maybe thinking about the Euclidean algorithm helps. The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying this property, replacing the larger number with the remainder when it's divided by the smaller one. Each step reduces the problem size, but keeps the gcd the same. So, the idea is that when you subtract multiples of one number from the other, the gcd doesn't change. That's why the remainder, which is what's left after subtracting qb from a, retains the gcd information.\n\nAnother way to see it is that any common divisor of a and b must also divide any linear combination of a and b. Since r is a linear combination (a - qb), the gcd must divide r. So the gcd of a and b is the same as the gcd of b and r. \n\nI think the key point here is understanding that the remainder r is a combination of a and b, and that divisors are preserved through these combinations. So even though we're changing the numbers from (a, b) to (b, r), the set of divisors that matter for the gcd doesn't change. This is fundamental to why the Euclidean algorithm works efficiently to find the gcd.",
