    "Content": "I'm trying to show that for any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$ there is a simple group $G$ of size $\\kappa$, I tried to use the compactness theorem and then ascending Löwenheim-Skolem, but this is impossible as the following argument shows: Suppose $F$ is a set of sentences in a first-order language containing the language of groups such that for any group $G$ we have $G\\vDash F$ iff $G$ is a simple group, let $\\varphi$ be a sentence such that $G\\vDash \\varphi $ iff $G$ is abelian. Then as for each prime $p$, $\\mathbb Z_p$ is simple and abelian, by the compactness theorem there is an infinite abelian simple group $G$, and thus using Löwenheim-Skolem we obtain an uncountable simple abelian group $G$. Pick a non-zero element $a\\in G$, then $\\langle a \\rangle$ is a proper normal subgroup of $G$. Contradiction. Note that the contradiction is not obtained by the existence of an infinite abelian simple group, something which I don't whether it's true or not, but by the assumption of the axiomatization of the simple groups, and the use of Lowënheim-Skolem theorem. Now, is there a way to prove this assertion? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For any (finite or infinite) cardinal $\\kappa$, if $\\kappa \\ge 5$ then the finitary alternating group $A(\\kappa)$ is simple .  This is the group consisting of permutations of $\\kappa$ that have finite support and are even.  (If $\\kappa$ is finite then this is just the ordinary alternating group $A_\\kappa$.)  If $\\kappa$ is infinite, then $A(\\kappa)$ has cardinality $\\kappa$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. The problem statement should then be clearly stated.\n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange: The user is trying to show that for any infinite cardinal κ, there exists a simple group G of size κ. They attempted using the compactness theorem and Löwenheim-Skolem but ran into a contradiction involving abelian groups. The core question is whether there's another way to prove the assertion that for every infinite cardinal, a simple group of that size exists.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions \"any infinite cardinal κ\" and that G is a simple group of size κ. The user's approach involved the compactness theorem and Löwenheim-Skolem, leading to a contradiction with abelian simple groups. However, the main assumptions here are about the existence of such a group for any infinite size, without specific constraints mentioned apart from simplicity and cardinality. The contradiction arose from assuming an axiomatization of simple groups, but the problem itself doesn't state those as assumptions. The key assumptions should be the given conditions in the problem statement, not the user's attempted method.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n- κ is an infinite cardinal.\n- G is a group.\n- G has size κ.\n- G is simple.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that such a G exists for any κ. So the assumptions are the given conditions, which are that κ is any infinite cardinal, and we need to show there's a simple group of that size. The user's own assumptions in their attempt (like using compactness theorem) aren't part of the problem's assumptions. The problem's actual assumptions are the premises given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions should be:\n- κ is an infinite cardinal.\n- G is a group of size κ.\n- G is simple.\n\nBut the problem is to show existence, so perhaps the assumptions are just the given conditions. The problem is to prove that for any infinite κ, there exists a simple group G with |G| = κ.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the assumptions would be the given conditions that need to hold for the problem. The problem states \"for any infinite cardinal κ\", so the assumption is that κ is an infinite cardinal. The rest is part of what needs to be proven (existence of G with those properties).\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nκ is an infinite cardinal.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a simple group G of size κ.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is \"Is there a simple group of any (infinite) size?\" and the user is trying to show for any infinite κ, there's a simple group of size κ. The problem statement after filtering should capture that. The user's own method led to a contradiction, but the core problem is the existence.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have the assumption that κ is an infinite cardinal, and the problem is to prove there's a simple group of size κ. The other parts about the user's attempt (using compactness, abelian groups, etc.) are part of their approach but not the actual problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nκ is an infinite cardinal.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a simple group G of size κ.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The key is to filter out the user's attempted method and focus on the core problem's assumptions and statement.",
