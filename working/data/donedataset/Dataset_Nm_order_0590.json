    "Content": "Let  $f(xy) =f(x)f(y)$ for all $x,y\\geq 0$. Show that $f(x) = x^p$ for some $p$. I am not very experienced with proof. If we let $g(x)=\\log (f(x))$ then this is the same as  $g(xy) = g(x) + g(y)$ I looked up the hint and it says let $g(x) = \\log f(a^x) $ The wikipedia page for functional equations only states the form of the solutions without proof. Attempt Using the hint (which was like pulling a rabbit out of the hat) Restricting the codomain $f:(0,+\\infty)\\rightarrow (0,+\\infty)$\nso that we can define the real function $g(x) =  \\log f(a^x)$ and we\nhave $$g(x+y) = g(x)+ g(y)$$ i.e $g(x) = xg(1)$ as $g(x)$ is continuous (assuming $f$ is). Letting $\\log_a f(a) = p$ we get $f(a^x) =a^p $. I do not have a rigorous argument but I think I can conclude that $f(x) = x^p$ (please fill any holes or unspecified assumptions) Different solutions are invited",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "So, we assume $f$ is continuous. Letting $g(x) = \\ln(f(a^x))$, we get\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ng(x+y) &= \\ln(f(a^{x+y})) = \\ln(f(a^xa^y)) = \\ln(f(a^x)f(a^y))\\\\\n &= \\log(f(a^x)) + \\ln(f(a^y))\\\\\n &= g(x)+g(y).\n\\end{align*}$$\nSo $g$ satisfies the Cauchy functional equation; if you assume $f$ is continuous, then so is $g$, hence $g(x) = xg(1)$ for all $x\\gt 0$. Since $g(1) = \\ln(f(a))$, we have\n$$f(a^x) = e^{g(x)} = e^{g(1)x} = (e^{x})^{g(1)}.$$\nGiven $r\\in \\mathbb{R}$, $r\\gt 0$, we have $r = a^{\\log_a(r)}$, hence\n$$\\begin{align*}\nf(r) &= f\\left(a^{\\log_a(r)}\\right)\\\\\n     &= \\left(e^{\\log_a(r)}\\right)^{g(1)}\\\\\n     &= \\left(e^{\\ln(r)/\\ln(a)}\\right)^{g(1)}\\\\\n     &= \\left(e^{\\ln(r)}\\right)^{g(1)/\\ln(a)}\\\\\n     &= r^{g(1)/\\ln(a)},\n\\end{align*}$$\nwhere we have used the change-of-base formula for the logarithm,\n$$\\log_a(r) = \\frac{\\ln r}{\\ln a}.$$\nFinally, since $g(1) = \\ln(f(a))$, we have\n$$f(r) = r^{\\ln(f(a))/\\ln(a)}.$$\nAs this works for any positive $a$, $a\\neq 1$, taking $a=e$ we get\n$$f(r) = r^{\\ln(f(e))}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to parse the original question and identify the key assumptions and the core problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about showing that a function f satisfying f(xy) = f(x)f(y) for all x, y ≥ 0 must be of the form f(x) = x^p for some exponent p. The user also mentioned some attempts, like defining g(x) = log(f(x)) leading to Cauchy's functional equation, and using a hint involving g(x) = log(f(a^x)). They also mention assuming continuity and the codomain being positive reals.\n\nSo, the main assumptions here are:\n\n1. The function f is defined for all x, y ≥ 0.\n2. The functional equation f(xy) = f(x)f(y) holds for all x, y ≥ 0.\n3. The codomain of f is (0, +∞), which allows taking logarithms without issues.\n4. The function f is continuous (as mentioned in the user's attempt, though they might not have stated it as a given assumption but rather as an assumed condition to solve the problem).\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the original question doesn't explicitly mention continuity. The user added that they assumed f is continuous to get the solution. However, in the standard Cauchy equation, without continuity, there are pathological solutions, but if we assume continuity, then the solution is linear. So, the problem might be missing some conditions. But the original question's problem statement says \"Show that f(x) = x^p for some p\" given f(xy)=f(x)f(y) for all x,y ≥0. But to conclude that, we need additional conditions like continuity, otherwise, it's not necessarily true. \n\nLooking back at the user's problem statement: They say \"not very experienced with proof\" and mention using the hint with g(x) = log f(a^x). They also mention the codomain is (0, +∞), which allows defining log. So, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- f: (0, +∞) → (0, +∞)\n- f(xy) = f(x)f(y) for all x, y > 0 (since domain is (0, +∞))\n- f is continuous (since the user mentioned \"assuming f is\" continuous)\n\nBut in the original problem statement as presented by the user, the problem says \"Let f(xy) =f(x)f(y) for all x,y≥0. Show that f(x) = x^p for some p.\" But when x=0, f(0) = f(0)f(y) for all y≥0. If y=0, then f(0) = f(0)^2, so f(0) is 0 or 1. If f(0) = 0, then for any y, f(0) = 0 = 0*f(y), which holds. But if f(0)=1, then f(0) =1 =1*f(y) implies f(y)=1 for all y. So, constant function 1 is a solution. However, x^p at x=0 would be 0 if p>0 and undefined if p<0, but the codomain is (0, +∞). So, the case when x=0 might complicate things. However, the user later mentions restricting the codomain to (0, +∞) and defining g(x) = log f(a^x). This suggests that perhaps the domain is actually (0, +∞), not including 0. Because otherwise, if x=0 is allowed, then f(0) is either 0 or 1, which doesn't fit x^p unless p=0 (for f(0)=1, but x^0 is 1 for x≠0). Hmm, maybe the original problem intended the domain to be positive reals excluding zero. The user wrote \"Restricting the codomain f:(0,+∞)→(0,+∞)\", so perhaps the problem should be considered on (0, ∞).\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- f is defined for all x > 0 (since including zero complicates things, and the user mentions (0, +∞))\n- f(xy) = f(x)f(y) for all x, y > 0\n- f is continuous (since otherwise, without this, we can't conclude it's a power function)\n- The codomain is (0, +∞), so f(x) > 0, allowing logarithms.\n\nBut the original problem statement as presented in the user's question says \"for all x,y ≥0\". However, the user then mentions restricting to (0, +∞). Maybe there's a mix-up here. To resolve this, I need to check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem as presented by the user:\n\nTitle: If f(xy)=f(x)f(y) then show that f(x) = x^t for some t\n\nQuestion: Let f(xy) =f(x)f(y) for all x,y≥0. Show that f(x) = x^p for some p. [...] Restricting the codomain f:(0,+infty)rightarrow (0,+infty)\n\nSo, the original problem states x,y ≥0, but the user then restricts to (0, ∞) for the codomain. However, the domain is still x,y≥0. But when they take log, they need f(x) >0, so if x=0 is allowed, f(0) must be positive. But earlier, f(0) = f(0)f(y), which implies f(0) =0 or 1. If codomain is (0, ∞), then f(0) must be 1. But x=0, f(0) =1, but x^p at x=0 is 0 if p>0, which would contradict f(0)=1. So perhaps the problem actually should consider x>0.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are that f is defined for x>0, codomain (0, ∞), and f(xy)=f(x)f(y) for x,y>0. Then, under continuity, f(x)=x^p. Alternatively, if the problem includes x=0, then f(0) must be 1 or 0, but f(x)=x^p for x>0 and f(0)=0 or 1. However, the user's attempt mentions using a^x, which is positive, so they are likely considering x>0.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- f: (0, +∞) → (0, +∞)\n- For all x, y > 0, f(xy) = f(x)f(y)\n- f is continuous (as needed to solve Cauchy's equation)\n\nThus, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would list each condition:\n\n1. f is a function from (0, +∞) to (0, +∞).\n2. For all x, y > 0, f(xy) = f(x)f(y).\n3. f is continuous.\n\nThe problem is to show that under these assumptions, f(x) = x^p for some p.\n\nWait, the original problem's title says \"If f(xy)=f(x)f(y) then show that f(x) = x^t for some t\", but the problem statement in the question says \"Let f(xy)=f(x)f(y) for all x,y≥0. Show that f(x) = x^p for some p.\" But with the considerations above, the domain is (0, ∞) to avoid issues with zero, and continuity is needed. So, the formatted problem should include these assumptions.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So, each assumption here would be:\n\n- The function f is defined on the domain (0, +∞).\n- The codomain of f is (0, +∞).\n- For all x, y > 0, f(xy) = f(x)f(y).\n- f is continuous.\n\nBut does the original problem explicitly state continuity? The user's problem statement says \"If f(xy)=f(x)f(y) then show that f(x) = x^t\". The user's own attempt mentions \"assuming f is continuous\". So, perhaps the original problem does not state continuity, but the solution requires it. However, without continuity, the conclusion isn't valid. Therefore, the problem as posed may be missing the continuity assumption. But in the example given by the user, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem changed it to \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\"\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem's assumption was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. That might be a mistake. However, perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, the original example's formatted problem has assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is \"n is divisible by 7\" added as an assumption? That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrectly formatted. But perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. But this is confusing. Wait, maybe the example is a mistake. For instance, if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the formatted problem's assumptions shouldn't add \"n is divisible by 7\". Unless there was a mistake.\n\nBut regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So, in the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. f is defined for all x ≥ 0 (but considering the user's restriction to (0, +∞), maybe that's part of the problem's assumptions)\n2. f(xy) = f(x)f(y) for all x, y ≥ 0 (or x, y > 0)\n3. f maps into (0, +∞)\n4. f is continuous\n\nBut the original problem as stated by the user says \"for all x,y≥0\" and \"Restricting the codomain f:(0,+infty)→(0,+infty)\". So, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: [0, ∞) → (0, ∞) (but this is problematic at x=0, as discussed)\nWait, but the user says \"Restricting the codomain f:(0,+infty)→(0,+infty)\", which suggests the domain is (0, ∞). Therefore, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\n- The domain of f is (0, +∞).\n- The codomain of f is (0, +∞).\n- For all x, y in (0, +∞), f(xy) = f(x)f(y).\n- f is continuous.\n\nTherefore, each of these would be separate assumptions.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- The domain of f is (0, +∞),\n- The codomain of f is (0, +∞),\n- For all x, y > 0, f(xy) = f(x)f(y),\n- f is continuous.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) = x^p for some p.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"Let f(xy) =f(x)f(y) for all x,y≥0. Show that f(x) = x^p for some p.\" But then mentions restricting to (0, +infty). So, perhaps the problem as posed has x,y≥0 but with f: (0, +infty) → (0, +infty), but including x=0. But since f(0) must be handled carefully, and the solution likely requires considering x>0. Therefore, the problem might need to assume domain (0, +infty) and continuity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem assumes continuity implicitly. But in the standard multiplicative functions, to get f(x)=x^p, you need continuity or some other regularity condition.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is defined for all x > 0,\n- f(x) > 0 for all x > 0,\n- For all x, y > 0, f(xy) = f(x)f(y),\n- f is continuous.\n\nProblem: Show that there exists a real number p such that f(x) = x^p for all x > 0.\n\nThis aligns with the standard result where continuous multiplicative functions on positive reals are power functions.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem, each assumption is listed separately.",
