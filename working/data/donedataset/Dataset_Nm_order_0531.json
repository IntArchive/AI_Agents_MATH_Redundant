    "Content": "Problem. Suppose that a sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{(n\\ge 1)}$ is a strict increasing sequence of positive integers such that\n$$\\forall i,\\phantom{;}j(i\\neq j);\\phantom{;}a_i \\not\\mid a_j$$\nProve that $a_{n+1}-a_{n}$ is unbounded. I had tried various kinds of ways but I couldn't prove the problem; Instead of it, I proved the following result, which is weaker than the original problem; Weaker result I proved.

I used Chinese remainder theorem to prove this. (I'll post it if you want it.) I tried to apply similar method for the original problem, but I failed; Do you have some ideas for the problem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Sequences of positive integers such that no element of the sequence is divisible by any other are called \"primitive\", and there has been a lot of work done figuring out how dense these sequences can be.  An early result of Erdős is that all primitive sequences must have lower density $0$, which immediately implies that they must have arbitrarily large gaps.  The proof is quite short and is given in \"Note on sequences of integers no one of which is divisible by any other\", J. London Math. Soc. 10 (1935), pp. 126-128. There is also a similar result in Felix Behrend, \"On Sequences of Numbers not Divisible one by another\", J. London Math. Soc. (1935) s1-10(1): 42-44 (paper is behind a pay wall.) A later, more precise result by Erdős, Sárközy and Szemerédi (\"On a theorem of Behrend\", J. Australian Mathematical Society, 7 (1967), pp. 9-16) is that if $(a_1,a_2,\\dots)$ is a primitive sequence, then\n$$\n\\sum_{a_i<x} \\frac{1}{a_i}=o(\\frac{\\log x}{\\sqrt{\\log \\log x}}),\n$$\nand this is best possible in the sense that the fraction on the right-hand side cannot be divided by any $h(x)$ with $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} h(x)=\\infty.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the original question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Is this sequence unbounded?\" The question is about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers {a_n} where for all i ≠ j, a_i does not divide a_j. The goal is to prove that the difference a_{n+1} - a_n is unbounded. The user also mentions they proved a weaker result where the gcd of any two terms is 1, and in that case, the differences are unbounded. They used the Chinese Remainder Theorem for that, but can't apply the same method here.\n\nSo, first, I need to list all assumptions. The sequence is strictly increasing, so each term is larger than the previous. All terms are positive integers. Also, for any distinct i and j, a_i does not divide a_j. Each assumption should be a separate line. Let me check the example given. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the original problem here, the sequence {a_n} has three conditions: it's strictly increasing, consists of positive integers, and any two distinct terms satisfy that one doesn't divide the other. Each of these should be separate assumptions. Wait, strictly increasing and positive integers might be considered separate. Let me see:\n\nAssumptions:\n- {a_n} is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers.\n- For all i ≠ j, a_i does not divide a_j.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"a strict increasing sequence of positive integers such that for all i ≠ j, a_i does not divide a_j.\" So perhaps breaking down into:\n1. {a_n} is a sequence of positive integers.\n2. {a_n} is strictly increasing.\n3. For all distinct i, j, a_i does not divide a_j.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The first two are about the nature of the sequence (positive integers, strictly increasing), the third is the divisibility condition. So each should be an individual assumption line. Then the problem is to prove that a_{n+1} - a_n is unbounded.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have three assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nChecking against the example, the assumptions were split into separate lines even if they were related. Like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Similarly here, each aspect is separated.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n{a_n} is a sequence of positive integers,\n{a_n} is strictly increasing,\nFor all distinct i, j, a_i does not divide a_j.\nProblem:\nProve that a_{n+1} - a_n is unbounded.\n\nYes, that seems right. The key is to split each distinct condition into separate lines. The problem statement is then the conclusion to prove. I don't see any other assumptions here. The original problem didn't mention anything else like specific bounds or other properties. So this should be the correct structure.",
