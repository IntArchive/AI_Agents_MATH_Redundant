    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\Gamma$ be the graph. If $\\Gamma$ is contained in a $1$-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb R^2$, then it in fact coincides with that line. Indeed, the line will necessarily be $L=\\{(\\lambda,\\lambda f(1)):\\lambda\\in\\mathbb R\\}$, and for all $x\\in\\mathbb R$ the line $L$ contains exactly one element whose first coordinate is $x$, so that $\\Gamma=L$. This is impossible, because it clearly implies that $f$ is continuous. We thus see that $\\Gamma$ contains two points of $\\mathbb R^2$ which are linearly independent over $\\mathbb R$, call them $u$ and $v$. Since $\\Gamma$ is a $\\mathbb Q$-subvector space of $\\mathbb R^2$, it contains the set $\\{au+bv:a,b\\in\\mathbb Q\\}$, and it is obvious that this is dense in the plane.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about additive functions, right? We know that if a function f: R → R satisfies f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all real numbers x and y, and if it's continuous, then it must be linear, specifically f(x) = kx for some constant k. But here, f isn't continuous, and we need to show that its graph is dense in R². Hmm, dense means that in any small region in the plane, there's a point (x, f(x)) from the graph. \n\nFirst, I remember that additive functions which aren't linear (i.e., discontinuous ones) are constructed using a basis of R over Q, right? Because over the reals, without continuity, the additive functions can behave wildly. They are linear when considered over the rationals but not over the reals. So, maybe the idea is that the graph can approximate any point in R² by leveraging the fact that the function is defined via a Hamel basis.\n\nWait, a Hamel basis is a basis for R as a vector space over Q. So, if we have such a basis, any real number can be written as a finite linear combination of basis elements with rational coefficients. Then, an additive function is determined by its values on the basis elements. If the function isn't continuous, then those values can be assigned in a way that's not proportional to the basis elements, leading to a \"wild\" function.\n\nBut how does that make the graph dense? Let's think. If the graph is dense, then for any (a, b) in R² and any ε > 0, there exists some x such that |x - a| < ε and |f(x) - b| < ε. So, given a and b, we need to find x close to a where f(x) is close to b.\n\nSince f is additive, it's Q-linear, right? So f(qx) = qf(x) for any q ∈ Q. But over R, it's not linear. So maybe we can use the density of Q in R to approximate any real number. Wait, but how does that interact with the function f?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the graph of f is a subgroup of R² under addition. Because if (x, f(x)) and (y, f(y)) are in the graph, then their sum is (x + y, f(x + y)) = (x + y, f(x) + f(y)), so the graph is indeed a subgroup. If this subgroup is not closed, then it must be dense. But how do we know it's not closed? Well, if f were continuous, the graph would be a closed line, hence closed. But since f is discontinuous, the subgroup isn't closed, so by the theorem that says a proper subgroup of R² is either discrete or dense, maybe the graph is dense.\n\nWait, but I need to recall the exact statement. In topological groups, a subgroup is either closed or has closure equal to the whole space? Not exactly. For example, in R, Q is a dense subgroup but not closed. So, maybe similar reasoning applies here. The graph of f is a subgroup of R². If f is discontinuous, then the graph isn't closed. If it's not closed, maybe it's dense. But how to formalize that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can directly construct points in the graph that get arbitrarily close to any given (a, b). Let's take any (a, b) in R². We need to find x close to a such that f(x) is close to b. Since f is additive, let's consider x = a + h, then f(x) = f(a) + f(h). So, we need f(h) ≈ b - f(a). But h is small (since x ≈ a), so h is close to 0. But f(h) for small h? Wait, but additive functions aren't necessarily continuous at 0. If they were, they'd be continuous everywhere. So since f is discontinuous, it's unbounded on every interval. That might be a key point.\n\nAh! If f is discontinuous, then it's unbounded on every interval. So, in particular, near any point a, the function f can take arbitrarily large values. Wait, but how does that help with density? Wait, maybe instead, because f is not linear, for any real number c, there exists x such that f(x) ≠ c x. But I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the graph is not dense. Then there exists an open set U in R² that doesn't intersect the graph. So, there exists some ε > 0 and a point (a, b) such that the ball around (a, b) with radius ε contains no points from the graph. That means for all x, either |x - a| ≥ ε or |f(x) - b| ≥ ε. How to derive a contradiction from that?\n\nSince f is additive, maybe we can use scaling. For instance, take x = q a where q is rational. Wait, but f is Q-linear. So f(q a) = q f(a). If we take multiples, perhaps we can get close. But not sure. Alternatively, use the fact that additive functions are either linear or have graphs dense. Wait, maybe it's a standard result in the theory of Cauchy's functional equation. Let me recall.\n\nYes, indeed, for additive functions f: R → R, if they are measurable, then they are linear. But if not, their graph is dense. So, the standard result is that a solution to Cauchy's equation is either of the form f(x) = kx, or its graph is dense in R². Therefore, the problem is essentially asking to prove this standard result.\n\nTo approach this, maybe assume that the graph is not dense, so there's an open ball disjoint from the graph. Then, using the additive property, show that f must be continuous, hence linear, contradicting the discontinuity.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if the graph is not dense, then its closure is a proper closed subgroup of R², which must be a line, implying f is linear.\n\nLet me try to sketch the proof.\n\nAssume that the graph G = {(x, f(x)) | x ∈ R} is not dense in R². Then, the closure of G, cl(G), is a closed subgroup of R². Closed subgroups of R² are isomorphic to R^k × Z^m, where k + m ≤ 2. Since G is a subgroup under addition, cl(G) is also a subgroup.\n\nIf cl(G) is a line, then G is contained in a line. But a line in R² is either vertical or non-vertical. If it's vertical, then x = 0, which can't be because G contains all (x, f(x)) for x ∈ R. If it's non-vertical, then the line is y = kx for some k. Hence, f(x) = kx, which contradicts the assumption that f is not continuous (since linear functions are continuous). Therefore, cl(G) cannot be a line. If cl(G) is the whole plane, then G is dense, which is what we want. But we assumed it's not dense, so cl(G) must be something else. But the only other possibilities are discrete subgroups or products of R and Z. However, since G is a graph of a function, it can't be discrete because for any x, there's a point (x, f(x)), so it's uncountable. The only closed subgroups of R² are either the whole space, a line, or a lattice (discrete subgroup). But a lattice is discrete, which isn't possible here because the graph is a function, so for each x, there's exactly one y. A lattice would require multiple points along the same x, which isn't the case. Hence, the only remaining possibility is that cl(G) is a line, which as we saw leads to a contradiction unless f is linear. Therefore, the assumption that G is not dense leads to f being linear (continuous), contradicting the given that f is not continuous. Hence, G must be dense.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Assume the graph is not dense.\n2. Its closure is a closed subgroup.\n3. Closed subgroups of R² are either the whole space, a line, or a lattice.\n4. Since the graph is a function, closure can't be a lattice.\n5. If closure is a line, then f must be linear, contradicting discontinuity.\n6. Hence, the closure must be the whole space, so the graph is dense.\n\nThat seems like the standard argument. Therefore, the problem is essentially about applying the structure theorem for closed subgroups of R² and showing that the only non-dense case leads to a contradiction with the function being discontinuous.",
