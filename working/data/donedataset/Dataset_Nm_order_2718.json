    "AcceptedAnswer": "Comment: Too long for a comment: We can construct $P_{n-1}$ which meets the condition. We can write: $n^5-n^3+n^2-n+1=n^5+n^4(n-1)-\\frac{n^6-1}{n-1}\\space\\space\\space \\space(1)$ It can be shown that for any $m \\in \\mathbb N$ and $a>1$ : $\\big(\\frac {a^m-1}{a-1}, a-1\\big)=(a-1, m)\\space\\space\\space \\space(2)$ Now with following restrictions we try to construct a prime using relation (1): $\\begin {cases}(n, n-1)=1\\\\(n, 6)=1\\end{cases}$ In this way $P_{n-1}$ can have following form: $P_{n-1}=(n-1)(n)(6)+ k; k\\in \\mathbb Z\\space\\space\\space \\space(3)$ Examples: $n=29\\rightarrow P_{28}=4872+ k$ For $k=+5$ we get $P_{28}=4877$ Note that $4877$ is not nth prime in the table of prime numbers.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to prove that for all n ≥ 2, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of p_{n-1} (which is the (n-1)th prime) and the value of the polynomial f(n) = n^5 - n^3 + n^2 - n + 1 is 1. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions based on the problem statement. The original problem mentions that this gcd is 1 for all n ≥ 2. The user also mentions that they tested this up to a large n and didn't find any counterexamples. Additionally, they talk about the polynomial f(X) being irreducible and that f(n+1) modulo p_n is not zero, which would imply that f(n+1) is not divisible by p_n. There's also mention of shifting the polynomial by ±1, but maybe that's part of their approach, not the original problem's assumptions.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, p_{n-1} is the (n-1)th prime number, and we need to consider the gcd of p_{n-1} and f(n). The problem is to prove that this gcd is always 1.\n\nWait, the problem statement in the title says \"gcd(p_{n-1}, n^5 - n^3 + n^2 - n +1) =1\". So p_{n-1} is the (n-1)th prime. For example, if n=2, then p_{1}=2, and we check gcd(2, f(2)) where f(2)=32 -8 +4 -2 +1=27. gcd(2,27)=1. For n=3, p_2=3, f(3)=243 -27 +9 -3 +1=223. gcd(3,223)=1. Etc.\n\nThe user's code checks up to n=10^8 and didn't find a case where the gcd isn't 1. So the problem is to prove this in general.\n\nNow, the user's own thoughts mention that f(X) is irreducible modulo each prime, and that f(n+1) ≠ 0 mod p_n, leading to some product in the units of a product ring. But I need to separate the original problem's assumptions from the user's conjectures or thoughts. The original problem's assumptions are just the conditions given, while the user's thoughts might be part of their attempt or reasoning, which we shouldn't include in the formatted problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem should be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n is greater than or equal to 2.\n- p_{n-1} is the (n-1)th prime number.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the gcd of p_{n-1} and f(n) is 1.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they structured the problem by listing each assumption on a separate line. So for the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, similarly, we should list each assumption separately. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 2,\np_{n-1} is the (n-1)th prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that gcd(p_{n-1}, n^5 - n^3 + n^2 - n + 1) = 1 for all n ≥ 2.\n\nI think that's the core. The user's additional comments about irreducibility and modulo primes are part of their own reasoning, not part of the problem's given conditions. The problem as stated in the title and the question is just about proving the gcd is 1 for all n ≥2. So the formatted problem should reflect that.",
