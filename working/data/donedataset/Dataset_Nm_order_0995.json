    "Content": "I was looking for a short snazzy proof on the following statement: n+1 vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ cannot be linearly independent A student of mine asked this today morning and I couldn't come up with a proof solely from the definition of linear independence . From a higher level perspective, I explained that if I put the vectors in a matrix then if the only null space entry is the zero vector, then the vectors are independent but since we have one extra column than row and that the row and column rank are equal, there is no way we can have $n+1$ as the rank of the matrix and hence from Rank-Nullity theorem, the dimension of the Nullspace is at least one which implies that there is a combination of the vectors where not all the scalar multiples in the definition are 0 but yet we get a zero as the linear combination. The student hasn't completely learnt the fundamental subspaces yet so I am not sure he grasped what I was saying. Is there a cleaner proof? EDIT: I am stunned how many beautiful answers I got with so much diversity.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let denote $(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)$ the standard basis of $\\mathbb R^n$ and suppose that $(f_1,\\ldots,f_{n+1})$ a set of  linearly independent vectors. We can write $$f_1=\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k e_k$$ and since $f_1\\ne 0$ there's $a_k\\ne 0$ and WLOG suppose $a_1\\neq0$ so $$e_1=\\frac{1}{a_1}\\left(f_1-\\sum_{k=2}^n a_k e_k\\right)$$ hence we see that $(f_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_n)$ spans $\\mathbb R^n$ . Now repeat $n$ times the same method (induction) and we find that $(f_1,\\ldots,f_{n})$ spans $\\mathbb R^n$ so the vectors $f_{n+1}$ is a linear combination of the other vectors $f_i$ which is a contradiction. If the induction step was not obvious, consider the following: Since we have established that $(f_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_n)$ spans $\\mathbb R^n$ , write $$f_2=b_1f_1+\\sum_{k=2}^n b_k e_k$$ Since $f_2\\neq0$ , there's at least one $b_l\\neq0$ . Also note that not all $(b_2,b_3,\\ldots,b_n)$ can be zero because otherwise it would imply that $f_2=b_1f_1$ contradicting the assumed linear independence of $(f_1,\\ldots,f_{n+1})$ . So we can take $b_l\\neq0$ where $l\\geq 2$ . WLOG suppose $b_3\\neq0$ . Now, $$e_3=\\frac{1}{b_3}\\left(f_2-b_1f_1-b_2e_2-\\sum_{k=4}^n b_k e_k\\right)$$ From this we see that, $(f_1,e_2,f_2,e_4,\\ldots,e_n)$ spans $\\mathbb R^n$ , where we replaced $e_3$ with $f_2$ . The assumed linear independence of the $f_i$ 's means that we can repeat this process to replaces all the $e_i$ 's.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified structure. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are structured. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that n+1 vectors in R^n cannot be linearly independent. The user's answer in the example lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So I need to extract the assumptions from the problem.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: The title is \"Prove that n+1 vectors in ℝ^n cannot be linearly independent.\" The question body adds that the user is seeking a proof from the definition of linear independence, without relying too much on matrix rank or fundamental subspaces, since the student hasn't covered that yet.\n\nSo the main assumptions here are:\n1. The vectors are in ℝ^n. Each vector is in ℝ^n.\n2. There are n+1 vectors. The number of vectors is one more than the dimension of the space.\n\nThese are the key conditions. The problem is to prove these n+1 vectors cannot be linearly independent. The example given in the user's prompt listed each assumption on a separate line, focusing on one object (the vectors) and their properties (being in ℝ^n, count being n+1). \n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single line. The problem statement is straightforward. So the formatted problem should have two assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nCheck if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions \"vectors in ℝ^n\" so the space is ℝ^n, and the number is n+1. No other conditions are given. The original problem doesn't specify any restrictions on n, like being positive or an integer, but typically n is a positive integer in such contexts. However, since the example provided didn't include assumptions about n being an integer unless it was part of the original problem, perhaps here we don't need to state n is an integer unless specified. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\" and the formatted assumption included \"$n$ is an integer\". But in this current problem, the original question doesn't explicitly state that n is an integer, but it's implied because n is the dimension of the vector space, so n must be a positive integer. However, the user's example included \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original? Wait no, let me check again. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem's assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user might have intended to present the problem as needing divisibility by 7, but that's a different issue. However, in the current problem, the user's task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem. So in this case, the problem is to prove that n+1 vectors in ℝ^n cannot be linearly independent. So the key assumptions are the vectors are in ℝ^n and there are n+1 of them. The problem is to prove they can't be linearly independent. So I need to list those two assumptions. Each on a separate line. Then state the problem. That's it. There's no additional condition like divisibility here. The example had an error perhaps, but the user's instruction is to follow the format. So for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vectors are in ℝ^n,\nThere are n+1 vectors.\n\nProblem: Prove that n+1 vectors in ℝ^n cannot be linearly independent.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption lines start with variables. For instance, \"$n$ is an integer\". So maybe here, the vectors are in ℝ^n is one assumption, and the number of vectors is n+1 is another. So written as:\n\nAssumption:\nEach vector is in ℝ^n,\nThere are n+1 vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states \"n+1 vectors in ℝ^n\", maybe the first assumption is \"Vectors are in ℝ^n\", the second is \"Number of vectors is n+1\".\n\nYes, that seems right. So the formatted problem would have those two assumptions. Let me check if there's any other hidden assumption. The problem is purely about linear independence in a real vector space of dimension n. The user's question mentions the student hasn't learned about rank and nullity yet, so the proof needs to use more basic definitions. But for formatting purposes, we don't need to include that. The assumptions are only those given in the problem statement. So the key is to extract the assumptions from the problem, not the context of the student's knowledge. The problem is to prove the statement, so the assumptions are inherent to the problem. Therefore, the two assumptions are:\n\n1. Each vector is in ℝ^n.\n2. There are n+1 vectors.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nEach vector is in $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\nThere are $n+1$ vectors.\nProblem:\nProve that $n+1$ vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ cannot be linearly independent.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The example had the problem's assumption as \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, here, the problem is about vectors in ℝ^n, so the first assumption is about the space they're in, and the second is about the count. So the answer should be structured that way.",
