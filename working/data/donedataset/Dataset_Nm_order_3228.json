    "Content": "As the title suggests, I am trying to prove $C_{mn}\\cong C_m\\times C_n$ when $\\gcd{(m,n)}=1$, where $C_n$ denotes the cyclic group of order $n$, using categorical considerations. Specifically, I am trying to show $C_{mn}$ satisfies the characteristic property of group product, which would then imply an isomorphism since both objects would be final objects in the same category. $C_{mn}$ does come with projection homomorpisms, namely the maps $\\pi^{mn}_m: C_{mn} \\rightarrow C_m$ and $\\pi^{mn}_n: C_{mn} \\rightarrow C_n$ which are defined by mapping elements of $C_{mn}$ to the redisue classes mod subscript. From here I have gotten a bit lost though, as I cannot see where $m$ and $n$ being relatively prime comes in. I am guessing it would make the product map commute, but I cannot see it. Any ideas? Note This is not homework. Also, I understand there are other ways to prove this, namely by considering the cyclic subgroup generated by the element $(1_m,1_n) \\in C_m\\times C_n$ and noting that the order of this element is the least common multiple of $m$ and $n$ and then using it's relation to $\\gcd{(m,n)}$. This then shows $\\langle (1_m,1_n)\\rangle$ has order $mn$ and is cyclic, hence must be isomorphic to $C_{mn}$. Also, $C_{mn}\\cong C_m\\times C_n$ has order $mn$, so $C_{mn}\\cong C_m\\times C_n=\\langle (1_m,1_n)\\rangle$, which completes the proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Just follow the definition: Let $X$ be any group, and $f:X\\to C_n$, $g:X\\to C_m$ homomorphisms. Now you need a unique homomorphism $h:X\\to C_{nm}$ which makes both triangles with $\\pi_n$ and $\\pi_m$ commute. And constructing this $h$ requires basically the Chinese Remainder Theorem (and is essentially the same as constructing the isomorphism $C_n\\times C_m\\to C_{nm}$ right away): for each pair $(f(x),g(x))$ we have to assign a unique $h(x)\\in C_{nm}$ such that, so to say, $h(x)\\equiv f(x) \\pmod n$ and $h(x)\\equiv g(x) \\pmod m$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the cyclic group C_{mn} is isomorphic to C_m × C_n when gcd(m, n) = 1 using categorical considerations, specifically by showing that C_{mn} satisfies the universal property of the product in the category of cyclic groups. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the universal property of a product is. In category theory, a product of two objects A and B is an object P with morphisms (projections) π₁: P → A and π₂: P → B such that for any object Q with morphisms f: Q → A and g: Q → B, there exists a unique morphism h: Q → P making the diagram commute, i.e., π₁∘h = f and π₂∘h = g.\n\nIn the context of groups, the product is the direct product, and the morphisms are group homomorphisms. So, if C_{mn} is to be the product of C_m and C_n, then for any group Q with homomorphisms to C_m and C_n, there must be a unique homomorphism from Q to C_{mn} that factors through the projections.\n\nThe user mentions projection homomorphisms π^{mn}_m: C_{mn} → C_m and π^{mn}_n: C_{mn} → C_n. These are defined by reducing modulo m and n respectively. For example, if C_{mn} is generated by an element x of order mn, then π^{mn}_m(x) would be x mod m, which has order m, and similarly for n. \n\nBut where does gcd(m, n) = 1 come into play here? The key must be related to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which states that if m and n are coprime, then the ring Z/mnZ is isomorphic to Z/mZ × Z/nZ. This isomorphism is both a ring isomorphism and a group isomorphism under addition, which corresponds to the cyclic groups in question. However, the user is working in the category of cyclic groups, so they need to establish that C_{mn} satisfies the universal property of the product when m and n are coprime.\n\nLet me think about how to set up the universal property here. Suppose we have another cyclic group Q with homomorphisms f: Q → C_m and g: Q → C_n. We need to show there's a unique homomorphism h: Q → C_{mn} such that π^{mn}_m ∘ h = f and π^{mn}_n ∘ h = g. \n\nSince Q is cyclic, let's say it's generated by an element q of order k. Then, the homomorphisms f and g are determined by where they send q. Let's say f(q) = a in C_m and g(q) = b in C_n. Since f is a homomorphism, the order of a must divide the order of q, which is k. Similarly, the order of b must divide k. \n\nBut since we want h: Q → C_{mn} such that h(q) maps to a under π^{mn}_m and to b under π^{mn}_n. That is, h(q) must be an element of C_{mn} that, when reduced mod m, gives a, and when reduced mod n, gives b. This is exactly the Chinese Remainder Theorem: if m and n are coprime, then the system of congruences x ≡ a mod m and x ≡ b mod n has a unique solution modulo mn. Therefore, h(q) is uniquely determined by a and b, which gives the unique homomorphism h. \n\nThis shows that C_{mn} satisfies the universal property of the product C_m × C_n when m and n are coprime. Since products are unique up to isomorphism in a category, this implies C_{mn} ≅ C_m × C_n. \n\nWait, but the user is trying to use the product's universal property. However, in the category of abelian groups, the product is the direct product, but in the category of cyclic groups, things might be different because the product might not exist unless the orders are coprime. Wait, actually, the category of cyclic groups isn't closed under products. For example, the product of two cyclic groups isn't necessarily cyclic unless they're coprime. So, in this case, when m and n are coprime, the product C_m × C_n is cyclic of order mn, hence isomorphic to C_{mn}. But the user is trying to show that C_{mn} is the product, not that the product is cyclic. Maybe the approach is to note that in the category of cyclic groups with morphisms being group homomorphisms, the product (in the categorical sense) of C_m and C_n, when they are coprime, is C_{mn}. Because the usual product (direct product) in the category of all groups is not cyclic unless m and n are coprime. Therefore, in the full category of groups, the product is the direct product, but in the subcategory of cyclic groups, the product exists only when m and n are coprime, and it's C_{mn}. \n\nBut the user's approach is to show that C_{mn} satisfies the universal property of the product of C_m and C_n. So, given any cyclic group Q with maps to C_m and C_n, there's a unique map to C_{mn}. The key here is the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which allows us to lift the pair of maps (mod m and mod n) to a unique map mod mn. Since m and n are coprime, the solution exists and is unique. Therefore, the uniqueness of the homomorphism h comes from the uniqueness in the Chinese Remainder Theorem. \n\nTherefore, the gcd(m, n) = 1 is essential here because it ensures that the Chinese Remainder Theorem applies, allowing the unique lifting of the homomorphisms. Without coprimality, the projections mod m and mod n might not uniquely determine a homomorphism into C_{mn}, and the necessary element in C_{mn} satisfying both congruences might not exist. \n\nSo, the main point is that the projections from C_{mn} to C_m and C_n, combined with the universal property enforced by the Chinese Remainder Theorem (due to coprimality), make C_{mn} the product in the category of cyclic groups when m and n are coprime. Hence, C_{mn} ≅ C_m × C_n.",
