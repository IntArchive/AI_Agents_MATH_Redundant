    "Content": "I was playing around with Desmos and noticed that:\n$$\\cos(2x)=\\log_{\\cos(1)}\\frac{\\cos(\\cos(x))}{\\cos(\\sin(x))}$$\nI derived this from:\n$$\\int_{\\cos(x)}^{\\sin(x)} \\tan(u)du$$\nwhen I noticed it looked similar to a sine wave, $\\ln(\\cos(1))\\cos(2x)$, did some algebra and came up with the identity. It seems to check out on a graphing calculator relatively well, except I have no idea why this works. This seems very intriguing to me because it includes nestled trig functions and the cosine of 1, which is very odd to equal a simple cosine function. If anybody can prove this, it could be interesting to see. I have a feeling this is slightly off, because of how much the complexities of the sides differ, so if anybody can disprove it, that would also be great. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The answers above already showed that this is not a true identity so I just want to show why this looks like a good approximation. Let us define $$ h(x) := \\frac{\\cos(\\cos(x))}{\\cos(\\sin(x))}, f(x) := \\log_{\\cos(1)} h(x). $$ There are a few key properties that are satisfied by $h(x)$ (and $f(x)$) which make it look like the trigonometric function $\\cos(2x)$: Just like $\\cos(2x)$, the function $h(x)$ (and hence $f(x)$) is $\\pi$-periodic because\n$$ h(x + \\pi) = \\frac{\\cos(\\cos(x + \\pi))}{\\cos(\\sin(x + \\pi))} = \\frac{\\cos(-\\cos(x))}{\\cos(-\\sin(x))} = \\frac{\\cos(\\cos(x))}{\\cos(\\sin(x))} = h(x).$$\nIf $f$ weren't periodic, by plotting $f$ and $\\cos(2x)$ you would immediately see that they can't be equal. In addition, the function $f(x)$ shares another symmetry with $\\cos(2x)$. Namely,\n$$ h \\left( x + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\cos \\left( \\cos \\left( x + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\right)}{\\cos \\left( \\sin \\left( x + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\right)} = \\frac{\\cos(-\\sin(x))}{\\cos(\\cos(x))} = \\frac{\\cos(\\sin(x))}{\\cos(\\cos(x))} = \\frac{1}{h(x)} \\implies \\\\\nf \\left( x + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = \\log_{\\cos(1)} \\left( \\frac{1}{h(x)} \\right) = - \\log_{\\cos(1)}(h(x)) = -f(x) $$\nwhile\n$$ \\cos \\left( 2 \\left(x + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\right) = \\cos(2x + \\pi) = - \\cos(2x). $$\nHence, the approximation on the whole of $\\mathbb{R}$ looks \"as good\" as the approximation on $\\left[ 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right]$ and again, without this symmetry it would be more clear graphically that the functions cannot be identical. The function $f$ agrees with $\\cos(2x)$ on five different points on $[0,\\pi]$ (and on infinitely many points on $\\mathbb{R}$ because of the periodicity). Namely,\n$$ f(0) = \\log_{\\cos(1)} \\frac{\\cos(\\cos(0)}{\\cos(\\sin(0))} = \\log_{\\cos(1)} \\frac{\\cos(1)}{\\cos(0)} = \\log_{\\cos(1)} \\cos(1) = 1 = \\cos(2 \\cdot 0), \\\\\n f \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = \\log_{\\cos(1)} \\frac{\\cos \\left( \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) \\right)}{\\cos \\left( \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) \\right)} = \\log_{\\cos(1)} 1 = 0 = \\cos \\left( 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right), \\\\\nf \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = -f(0) = -1 = \\cos \\left( 2 \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right), \\\\\nf \\left( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\right) = -f \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = 0 = \\cos \\left( 2 \\cdot \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\right), \\\\\nf(\\pi) = f(0) = 1 = \\cos(2\\pi). $$ The derivatives of $f$ and $\\cos(2x)$ agree on three of the five points above (at $x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $x = \\pi$). Given all the properties above it is not surprising that the functions looks quite the same without zooming in. For example, if instead of $f$ we would take an Hermite interpolation polynomial which agrees with $\\cos(2x)$ at the points $x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}, \\pi$ and whose derivatives agree with the derivatives of $\\cos(2x)$ at $x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi$, we would get a polynomial approximation given by Plotting it against $\\cos(2x)$ on $[0,4]$ we would get You can see that without zooming in, it is impossible to see the difference between $\\cos(2x)$ and this interpolation polynomial on $[0,\\pi]$. The only reason we see the difference is that the polynomial is not periodic so after being close to $\\cos(2x)$ on $[0,\\pi]$ it starts shooting up. For $f$, we do not have this phenomenon so the interpolation looks to our eyes even better.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user claims that the equation cos(2x) equals the logarithm base cos(1) of [cos(cos x) divided by cos(sin x)]. They derived this from an integral involving tan(u) from cos(x) to sin(x), which they thought looked similar to a scaled cosine wave. But they're unsure if it's exact or not.\n\nFirst, I need to verify if the identity holds. Let me start by evaluating both sides for specific values of x. Let's pick x = 0. \n\nLeft side: cos(0) = 1, so cos(2*0) = cos(0) = 1.\n\nRight side: log_{cos(1)} [cos(cos(0))/cos(sin(0))]. cos(0) is 1, sin(0) is 0. So cos(1)/cos(0) = cos(1)/1 = cos(1). Then log base cos(1) of cos(1) is 1. So both sides equal 1 at x=0. That works.\n\nNext, try x = π/4. Left side: cos(π/2) = 0.\n\nRight side: log_{cos(1)} [cos(cos(π/4))/cos(sin(π/4))]. cos(π/4) is √2/2 ≈ 0.707, sin(π/4) is same. So compute cos(√2/2) divided by cos(√2/2) which is 1. Log base anything of 1 is 0. So right side is 0. Matches left side. Hmm, okay.\n\nAnother test: x = π/6. Left side: cos(π/3) = 0.5.\n\nRight side: log_{cos(1)} [cos(cos(π/6))/cos(sin(π/6))]. cos(π/6) is √3/2 ≈0.866, sin(π/6) is 0.5. So compute cos(√3/2) and cos(0.5). Let me calculate these numerically.\n\nFirst, cos(√3/2). Let me approximate √3 ≈1.732, so √3/2 ≈0.866. So cos(0.866 radians) ≈0.646.\n\nThen cos(0.5 radians) ≈0.877. So the ratio is 0.646 / 0.877 ≈0.737.\n\nNow, log base cos(1) of 0.737. cos(1) ≈0.5403. So log_0.5403(0.737). Remember that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). So compute ln(0.737) ≈-0.304, ln(0.5403)≈-0.615. Then -0.304 / -0.615 ≈0.494. Which is close to 0.5, but not exactly. Hmm. So the right side is approximately 0.494 vs left side 0.5. There's a slight discrepancy here. So maybe the identity is approximate but not exact.\n\nBut the user mentioned it's close on a graph but they suspect it's slightly off. So perhaps the equation isn't an exact identity but an approximation. Let me check another point. Let's take x = π/3.\n\nLeft side: cos(2π/3) = cos(120°) = -0.5.\n\nRight side: log_{cos(1)} [cos(cos(π/3))/cos(sin(π/3))]. cos(π/3)=0.5, sin(π/3)=√3/2≈0.866. So compute cos(0.5)≈0.877 and cos(0.866)≈0.646. Ratio is 0.877/0.646≈1.357. Then log base 0.5403 of 1.357. ln(1.357)≈0.305, ln(0.5403)≈-0.615. So 0.305 / -0.615 ≈-0.496. Which is close to -0.5. Again, close but not exact. So maybe the identity is approximately true for some x but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a scaling factor or a different base that would make it exact. Let's see the original integral: ∫_{cos x}^{sin x} tan u du. Let's compute that integral. The integral of tan u is -ln |cos u| + C. So evaluated from cos x to sin x: -ln |cos(sin x)| + ln |cos(cos x)| = ln [cos(cos x)/cos(sin x)]. So the integral equals ln [cos(cos x)/cos(sin x)].\n\nThe user says they noticed this integral looked similar to ln(cos(1)) * cos(2x). So they equate ln [cos(cos x)/cos(sin x)] = ln(cos(1)) * cos(2x). Then solving for cos(2x), they get cos(2x) = log_{cos(1)} [cos(cos x)/cos(sin x)].\n\nBut the integral is exactly ln [cos(cos x)/cos(sin x)]. So if that is equal to ln(cos(1)) * cos(2x), then taking exponentials on both sides with base cos(1), we get [cos(cos x)/cos(sin x)] = [cos(1)]^{cos(2x)}. So the identity is equivalent to [cos(cos x)/cos(sin x)] = [cos(1)]^{cos(2x)}.\n\nTo check if this is true, maybe expand both sides in Taylor series around x=0 and see if they match.\n\nAlternatively, consider if there's a substitution or identity that can make this hold. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original integral was approximated by the user as resembling a cosine wave, leading to an approximate identity. But since the tests show slight discrepancies, it's likely an approximation rather than an exact identity.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove or disprove whether cos(2x) equals log_{cos(1)} [cos(cos x)/cos(sin x)] for all x. Since numerical examples show slight mismatches, perhaps the identity isn't exact. To formally disprove it, we can take the derivative of both sides and see if they match.\n\nLet me compute the derivative of both sides. Left side: d/dx cos(2x) = -2 sin(2x).\n\nRight side: d/dx [ (ln (cos(cos x)/cos(sin x)) ) / ln cos(1) ) ].\n\nFirst, let's denote the right side as (1 / ln cos(1)) * [ln cos(cos x) - ln cos(sin x)].\n\nDerivative: (1 / ln cos(1)) * [ (-sin(cos x) * (-sin x) / cos(cos x) ) - ( -sin(sin x) * cos x / cos(sin x) ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1 / ln cos(1)) * [ (sin x sin(cos x))/cos(cos x) + (cos x sin(sin x))/cos(sin x) )\n\n= (1 / ln cos(1)) * [ sin x tan(cos x) + cos x tan(sin x) ]\n\nCompare to left side derivative: -2 sin(2x) = -4 sin x cos x.\n\nIf the identity were exact, then these derivatives should be equal. Let's check at x=0.\n\nAt x=0:\n\nRight side derivative: (1 / ln cos(1)) * [0 * tan(1) + 1 * tan(0) ] = (1 / ln cos(1)) * 0 = 0.\n\nLeft side derivative: -4*0*1=0. So they match at x=0.\n\nAt x=π/4:\n\nRight side derivative: (1 / ln cos(1)) [ sin(π/4) tan(cos(π/4)) + cos(π/4) tan(sin(π/4)) ]\n\nsin(π/4)=cos(π/4)=√2/2≈0.707. cos(π/4)=√2/2≈0.707, so cos(cos(π/4))=cos(0.707)≈0.760. tan(0.707)≈0.855. Similarly, sin(sin(π/4))=sin(0.707)≈0.649. tan(0.707)≈0.855. So:\n\n≈ (1 / ln 0.5403) [0.707*0.855 + 0.707*0.855] ≈ (1 / (-0.615)) [0.606 + 0.606] ≈ (-1.626) * 1.212 ≈ -1.97.\n\nLeft side derivative: -4*(√2/2)*(√2/2) = -4*(0.5) = -2. Close but not exactly the same. The right side derivative is approximately -1.97 vs left -2. Again, slight difference.\n\nThus, the derivatives are close but not exactly the same, implying the identity is approximate. Therefore, the equation is not exact. Hence, the answer is that the identity does not hold exactly, but is an approximation. So the problem is to prove or disprove the identity, and the conclusion is that it's not exact.",
