    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object. The problem statement is then restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question: \"Proving $4^n=\\sum_{k=0}^n2^k\\binom{2n-k}{n}$\". The user tried formal power series but failed. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is an identity involving a summation. The variables here are n and k. The summation runs from k=0 to k=n, and the binomial coefficient is part of the term. \n\nAssumptions would include that n is a non-negative integer, since it's an upper limit of the summation and binomial coefficients are typically defined for non-negative integers. Also, each term in the sum involves 2^k multiplied by the binomial coefficient C(2n - k, n). So, the assumptions should cover the domain of n and k.\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state any restrictions on n, but in combinatorial identities, n is usually a non-negative integer. So, the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. Each k in the summation ranges from 0 to n, so k is an integer between 0 and n inclusive. However, the example given in the user's instruction only lists assumptions about the main variable (like n being an integer and divisible by 7 in their example). The example didn't mention k, perhaps because k is a dummy variable in the summation.\n\nSo, perhaps the key assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer. The problem is to prove the identity holds for all such n. The example's assumptions were about n, so following that, the assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem statement is straightforward: Prove that 4^n equals the sum from k=0 to n of 2^k multiplied by the binomial coefficient (2n -k choose n).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$4^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k \\binom{2n - k}{n}$$.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The original question mentions trying formal power series but failing. That might imply that the problem is looking for a combinatorial proof or another method, but the user just wants the problem structured, not the solution. So the assumptions are just about the variables involved. Since the binomial coefficient is defined for integers, and the summation is from 0 to n, n must be a non-negative integer. That's the key assumption.",
