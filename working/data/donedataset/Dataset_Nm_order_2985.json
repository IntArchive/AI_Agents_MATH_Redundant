    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this math problem into the specified format. The original problem is about showing that if a + b + c divides a² + b² + c², then it divides aⁿ + bⁿ + cⁿ for infinitely many positive integers n. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a, b, c are positive integers. Then there's the condition that a + b + c divides a² + b² + c². The conclusion to prove is about divisibility for infinitely many n.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the objects are a, b, c. The first assumption is that they are positive integers. The second is the divisibility condition. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. But in our current problem, the assumptions are on a, b, c, not on n. The problem is to show that for infinitely many n (which are positive integers), the divisibility holds. So n here is part of the problem statement's quantifier, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions should be about a, b, c.\n\nSo the first assumption is that a, b, c are positive integers. The second is that a + b + c divides a² + b² + c². The problem is then to show that a + b + c divides aⁿ + bⁿ + cⁿ for infinitely many positive integers n.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem is composed by Laurentiu Panaitopol, but that's probably just attribution, not part of the problem. The original problem's title mentions \"for infinitely many n\", which is part of the problem statement. The user's example didn't include quantifiers in the assumptions, just the conditions on the variables. So in the example, n was part of the problem's statement but had an additional assumption (divisible by 7), which was in the original problem. Here, the original problem's condition is only on a, b, c. So the assumptions are a, b, c positive integers and a + b + c | a² + b² + c². The problem is to show a + b + c divides aⁿ + bⁿ + cⁿ for infinitely many positive integers n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \na, b, c are positive integers,\na + b + c divides a² + b² + c².\nProblem: \nShow that a + b + c divides aⁿ + bⁿ + cⁿ for infinitely many positive integers n.\n\nI think that's it. No other hidden assumptions. The key is to list each condition separately. So two assumptions: one about the variables being positive integers, and the divisibility condition. Then the problem is to show the conclusion.",
