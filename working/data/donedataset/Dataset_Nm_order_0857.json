    "Content": "Suppose $G$ is a finite group such that $g$ is conjugate to $g^2$ for every $g\\in G$. Here's a proof that $G$ is trivial.  First, observe that if $\\lvert G\\rvert$ is even, then $G$ contains an element $h$ of order $2$, in which case, $h$ is conjugate to $h^2=1$.  But this implies that $h=1$, so $h$ does not have order $2$.  By contradiction, $\\lvert G\\rvert$ is odd.  Then, by the Feit–Thompson theorem, $G$ is solvable.  In particular, this means that the derived series of $G$ terminates.  However, for any $g$ in $G$, there exists $a\\in G$ such that $g^2=aga^{-1}$, i.e., $g=aga^{-1}g^{-1}\\in G^{(1)}$.  It follows that $G^{(1)}=G$.  In fact, this shows that $G^{(n)}=G$ for all $n\\geq 1$.  Since the derived series of $G$ terminates, this implies that $G$ must be trivial. While I'm convinced of the result, this proof is not particularly satisfying to me, since it relies on Feit-Thompson.  Is there an elementary proof that $G$ is trivial?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As you say, $G$ must have odd order. Let $p$ be the smallest prime factor\nof the order of $G$, and $a$ an element of order $p$. Let $H$ be the subgroup generated by $a$, $C$ be the centraliser of $H$ and $N$ the normaliser of $H$. Then\n$r=|N:C|$ is the number of elements of $H$ which are conjugates of $a$. So\n$r<p$ but $r>1$, as $a^2\\ne a$ is the conjugate of $a$. But $r\\mid |G|$\nand $1<r<p$, contradicting $p$ being the smallest (prime) factor of $|G|$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that a finite group where every element is conjugate to its square must be trivial. The user provided an example of how to format a similar problem, so I should follow that structure closely.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that G is a finite group and every element g in G is conjugate to its square g². The example format lists each assumption line by line, addressing only one property per line. So, the assumptions here are two-fold: G is a finite group, and for every element g in G, g is conjugate to g². Each of these is a separate condition, so they should be on separate lines.\n\nNext, the problem statement itself is to prove that G is trivial. The original question also mentions that the proof provided uses the Feit-Thompson theorem, and the user is asking for an elementary proof. However, according to the format instructions, the problem part should just be the problem to solve, not the request for an elementary proof. So, the problem is to show G is trivial under the given assumptions.\n\nI need to make sure there's no extra information in the assumptions or problem statement. The original question mentions some steps in the proof, like the order of G being odd and using the derived series, but those are part of the existing proof attempt, not the problem's assumptions. The key assumptions are just the group being finite and the conjugacy condition.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. For every element g in G, g is conjugate to g².\n\nProblem:\nProve that G is trivial.\n\nI should check the example again to confirm. In the example, the assumption lines are separate, each stating a single condition. The problem part is the main statement to prove. The user's example included the divisibility condition and the integer n. Similarly, here, the two conditions are the group being finite and the conjugacy of each element to its square. \n\nThe original question's title and content are a bit more detailed, but I need to filter out the extraneous information like the user's discussion of the existing proof using Feit-Thompson. The core problem is just the assumptions and the conclusion that G is trivial.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nFor every element g in G, g is conjugate to g².\n\nProblem:\nProve that G is trivial.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the required format. Each assumption is a single condition, and the problem is clearly stated. I don't need to include anything about the proof method or the user's dissatisfaction with using Feit-Thompson. Just the mathematical assumptions and the problem to solve.",
