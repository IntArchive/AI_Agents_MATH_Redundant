    "Content": "While experimenting with integrals involving the Dedekind Eta function, I came across a family of integrals which seem to follow \na very simple pattern. With $y \\in \\mathbb{N}$, define:\n$$A(y) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\eta( i x)\\,\\eta(i x y)\\,dx.$$\nThe integral can be rewritten in the following infinite series forms: \\begin{align}\nA(y) & = \\frac{12}{\\pi} \\sum_{(n,m) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2} \\frac{(-1)^{n+m}}{(6n+1)^2+y \\, (6m+1)^2} \\\\[8pt]\n& =\\frac{2 \\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{y}} \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\frac{(-1)^n}{6n+1} \\, \\dfrac{ \\sinh \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{y}}{3} (6n+1)}{\\cosh \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{y}}{2} (6n+1)} \\\\[8pt]\n& = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{y}} \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (-1)^n \\tanh^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\operatorname{sech}(\\pi \\sqrt{y} (n+1/6))\\right).\n\\end{align} Numerical computations seem to confirm that \\begin{align}\nA(1) & = \\ln\\left(1+ \\sqrt{3} +\\sqrt{3+2 \\sqrt{3}} \\right) \\tag{1} \\\\[8pt]\nA(2) & = \\frac1{\\sqrt{2}} \\ln \\left(1+ \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{2+ 2 \\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\tag{2} \\\\[8pt]\nA(3) & = \\frac1{\\sqrt{3}} \\ln \\left( 1+ 2^{1/3} + 2^{2/3} \\right) \\tag{3}\n\\end{align} And generally, it looks like $$A(y) = \\frac1{\\sqrt{y}} \\,\\ln u \\tag{4}$$\nwhere $u$ is the root closest to $1$ from above, of a polynomial $P_y$. \nI've checked dozens of different $y$'s and made a list of those polynomials - check this pastebin link. Some are missing, e.g. I could not find $P_6$. Others seem to follow patterns of their own, for example the Heegner numbers. Here's the polynomial for $y=163$: $$\\small P_{163}(u) = u^{12} + 640314 u^{10} + 1280624 u^9 + 640287 u^8 - 1280736 u^7 - 2561412 u^6 - 1280736 u^5 + 640287 u^4 + 1280624 u^3 + 640314 u^2 + 1 = 0$$ Other interesting things to look at are the behaviour of $P_y(1)$ and $P_y(-1)$, with regard to $y \\pmod{24}$, and approximations to $\\pi$ which follow from terminating the infinite series at its first term. However, I have got no clue how to prove it. What would be a way to prove $(4)$? What can be said about the polynomials $P_y$?\n  Also, can you help me find $P_6$, or other missing polynomials from my list? Edit. Finally, I was able to produce a closed form for this integral thanks to @DaveHuff's hints. The idea is to rewrite the infinite series as\n $$A(y) = \\frac2{\\sqrt{y}} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\tanh^{-1}\\left( \\dfrac{\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{6} (2n+1)}{\\cosh \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{y}}{6} (2n+1)}\\right),$$\nand then, using $\\displaystyle \\,\\,\\,\\tanh^{-1}x = \\frac12 \\ln \\left( \\frac{1+x}{1-x} \\right),$ proceed to factorize the summand and obtain \n$$\\sqrt{y} \\,A(y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\ln \\left( \\dfrac{(1-e^{5 \\pi i n/6-\\pi n\\sqrt{y}/6})(1-e^{-5 \\pi i n/6-\\pi n\\sqrt{y}/6})}{(1-e^{ \\pi i n/6-\\pi n\\sqrt{y}/6})(1-e^{-\\pi i n/6-\\pi n\\sqrt{y}/6})} \\right),$$ which means: \n$$A(y) = \\frac1{\\sqrt{y}} \\,\\ln \\left( \\dfrac{\\eta\\left(\\frac{i \\sqrt{y}+5}{12}\\right)\\eta\\left(\\frac{i \\sqrt{y}-5}{12}\\right)}{\\eta\\left(\\frac{i \\sqrt{y}+1}{12}\\right)\\eta\\left(\\frac{i \\sqrt{y}-1}{12}\\right)}\\right).$$ I still don't know enough eta quotient theory, so I don't know how to show that this eta quotient is in fact algebraic for every natural $y$ (let alone bring it to the implicit form in @TitoPiezasIII 's answer), but this is still good progress.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I. We assume it is true your integral $A(y)$ is,\n$$A(y) = \\frac1{\\sqrt{y}} \\,\\ln u \\tag{4}$$\nThe problem is to find $u$. After some laborious manipulation, it turns out that if $\\color{blue}{\\tau=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-y}}{2}}$, then we have the rather simple relation,\n$$\\big(\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)\\big)^{24} =\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt2\\,\\eta(2\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}\\right)^{24}=\\frac{(u^2-1)^6}{(-u^3-u^2-u)^3}\\tag5$$\nwhere $\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)$ is a Weber modular function . Since for integer $y>0$, the eta quotient $\\frac{\\eta(\\tau)}{\\eta(2\\tau)}$ is an algebraic number, then $u$ is also an algebraic number. II. The advantage of using $\\frac{\\eta(\\tau)}{\\eta(2\\tau)}$ is that it is well-studied and the algebraic numbers it forms are simpler than $u$. For example, let $\\tau=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-6}}{2}$, then $w = \\Big(\\frac{\\eta(\\tau)}{\\eta(2\\tau)}\\Big)^{24}$ is just a root of a quartic, $$2^{12} - 4831232 w + 108672 w^2 + 2272 w^3 + w^4 = 0\\tag6$$ To find $P_6$, we use $(5)$ as, $$\\frac{2^{12}}{w}=\\frac{(u^2-1)^6}{(-u^3-u^2-u)^3}\\tag7$$ Eliminating $w$ between $(6),(7)$ ( I assume you have CAS? ) and we get a high $24$th deg polynomial in $u$ and which was one reason you had trouble finding it. $\\color{green}{Update:}$ As requested, here is the method to find $(5)$. It is not that \"laborious\" in retrospect, but it does need some effort to spot the usual patterns. From previous experience, it has been frequently observed that the minpoly of a modular function with argument $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-d}}{2}$ and $d$ a Heegner number has near multiples of a power of the j-function $j(\\tau)$ amongst the coefficients. For example, one can see integers close to $640320$ in,\n$$\\small P_{163}(u) = u^{12} + 640314 u^{10} + 1280624 u^9 + 640287 u^8 - 1280736 u^7 - 2561412 u^6 - 1280736 u^5 + 640287 u^4 + 1280624 u^3 + 640314 u^2 + 1 = 0$$\nIn fact, if we let,\n$$r = -\\sqrt[3]{j(\\tau)}\\tag8$$\nthen the above has the palindromic form,\n$$\\small 1 + (r - 6) u^2 + 2(r - 8) u^3 + (r - 33) u^4 + 2(-48 - r) u^5 + 4(-33 - r) u^6 + \\\\ \\small2(-48 - r) u^7 + (r - 33) u^8 + 2(r - 8) u^9 + (r - 6) u^{10} + u^{12}=0\\tag9$$ \nChecking its discriminant $D$ (one should always check this) shows it is the neat,\n$$D=-2^{24}\\cdot3^{15}(n+18)^4(n^2+108)^6$$\nwhere $n=r-6$. Plus, testing with non-Heegner $d$ and the same equation holds which suggests it is valid generally. Since the j-function can be expressed by eta quotients as,\n$$j(\\tau) = \\frac{(x+16)^3}{x},\\quad\\text{where}\\quad\\small x = \\big(\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)\\big)^{24} =\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\eta(2\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}\\right)^{24}\\tag{10}$$\nEliminating $r$ and $j(\\tau)$ between $(8),(9),(10)$ and choosing the appropriate factor then yields $(5)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the main problem from the original question.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is then stated clearly.\n\nThe original question here is about integrals involving the Dedekind Eta function. The user defines A(y) as an integral from 0 to infinity of η(ix)η(ixy)dx. They provide several series forms for A(y) and numerical results for specific y values, leading to the conjecture that A(y) can be expressed as (1/sqrt(y)) ln u, where u is the root closest to 1 of a polynomial P_y. They also ask about proving this, properties of P_y, and finding missing polynomials like P_6.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The integral is defined for y in natural numbers. The problem is to prove equation (4) and analyze the polynomials P_y, as well as find missing ones like P_6.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n- y is a natural number.\n- A(y) is defined as the integral of η(ix)η(ixy) from 0 to infinity.\n- The integral can be rewritten in the given series forms.\n- Numerical computations confirm specific expressions for A(1), A(2), A(3), etc.\n- The general form A(y) = (1/sqrt(y)) ln u, where u is the root closest to 1 of polynomial P_y.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line.

The user here has multiple questions: proving (4), analyzing P_y, finding missing polynomials. The problem part should encapsulate the main question. The original question asks: \"What would be a way to prove (4)? What can be said about the polynomials P_y? Also, can you help me find P_6, or other missing polynomials from my list?\"\n\nSo the problem should combine these into a concise statement. Maybe:\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y}} \\ln u$$ where u is the root closest to 1 from above of a polynomial $P_y$, analyze the properties of the polynomials $P_y$, and determine the missing polynomials such as $P_6$.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line. Let me check again:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. y is a natural number.\n2. A(y) is defined as the integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\eta(ix)\\eta(ixy) dx$.\n3. The integral A(y) can be expressed in the three provided infinite series forms.\n4. Numerical computations confirm the specific expressions for A(1), A(2), A(3) as given.\n5. A(y) is conjectured to have the form $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y}} \\ln u$ where u is the root closest to 1 of a polynomial $P_y$.\n\nThat seems to cover the main assumptions. Each line addresses one property. The problem then is to prove the conjecture, analyze the polynomials, and find missing ones.\n\nYes, this should be structured correctly.",
