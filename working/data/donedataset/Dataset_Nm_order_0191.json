    "Content": "Assume that there exists a function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that is bijective and satisfies\n$$\nf(x) + f^{-1}(x)=x\n$$\nfor all $x$. Here $f^{-1}$ is the inverse function. Show that $f$ is odd. This was a brain-teaser given to me by a friend. Two other related questions are: Show that $f$ is discontinuous Give an example of such a function (if indeed one exists). Edit: As an initial idea, maybe approaching the problem graphically would help? A function and its inverse are reflections of each other about $y=x$ on the $x$-$y$ plane. Does this lead to anywhere?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is finally a constructive example of a solution, continuous except on a countable set. Let $\\phi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}$, and let\n$$f(x) =  \\begin{cases} \n      0 & \\text{if }x = 0 \\\\\n      -\\phi x & \\text{if }|x| \\in [\\phi^{3k}, \\phi^{3k+1}), k \\in \\mathbb Z \\\\\n      \\phi x & \\text{if } |x| \\in [\\phi^{3k+1}, \\phi^{3k+2}), k \\in \\mathbb Z \\\\\n      \\phi^{-2} x & \\text{if } |x| \\in [\\phi^{3k+2}, \\phi^{3k+3}), k \\in \\mathbb Z \\\\\n   \\end{cases}\n$$ Then $f$ is a bijection, whose inverse is\n$$f^{-1}(x) =  \\begin{cases} \n      0 & \\text{if }x = 0 \\\\\n      \\phi^2 x & \\text{if }|x| \\in [\\phi^{3k}, \\phi^{3k+1}), k \\in \\mathbb Z \\\\\n      -\\phi^{-1} x & \\text{if } |x| \\in [\\phi^{3k+1}, \\phi^{3k+2}), k \\in \\mathbb Z \\\\\n      \\phi^{-1} x & \\text{if } |x| \\in [\\phi^{3k+2}, \\phi^{3k+3}), k \\in \\mathbb Z \\\\\n   \\end{cases}\n$$\nChecking each case shows that $f(x)+f^{-1}(x) = x$, as required.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified Assumption and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Proving that a function is odd.\" The problem states that there's a bijective function f from R to R satisfying f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x for all x. They need to show f is odd. There are also other parts mentioned, like showing f is discontinuous and giving an example, but the main task here is just the first part about the function being odd.\n\nNow, following the example provided, the Assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem mentions that f is a function from R to R, it's bijective, and satisfies the equation f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x for all x. Each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nWait, the original example included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each as separate lines. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: R → R is a function.\n- f is bijective.\n- For all x, f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x.\n\nThen the problem is to show that f is odd, meaning f(-x) = -f(x) for all x.\n\nBut wait, the original problem in the example had an assumption about n being an integer and another about n being divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the function f. Each property (being a function from R to R, bijective, satisfying the equation) should be separate. So I need to split them into individual points.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem doesn't mention continuity or differentiability, so those aren't part of the assumptions. The user also mentioned to filter out unrelated information. The question mentions other parts (show discontinuous, give example) but those are additional questions, not part of the current problem. So the formatted problem should only address showing f is odd under the given assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function with domain and codomain ℝ,\nf is bijective,\nFor all real numbers x, f(x) + f⁻¹(x) = x.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f is odd.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is one condition per line. The first line is about the function's domain and codomain. The second is bijectivity. The third is the functional equation. Each is a separate condition, so that's correct. The problem statement is to show f is odd. That seems to fit the required format.",
