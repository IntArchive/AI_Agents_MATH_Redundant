    "Content": "I'm trying to prove the cantor set $C$ is equivalent to the set of all numbers with ternary expansion of $2$'s and $0$'s. That is: Let $A_0=[0,1]$. $A_n$ is defined to equal $A_{n-1}$ with it's middle third removed. let $C=\\bigcap_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} A_n$.\n Prove $C =\\{x=0.a_1a_2a_3...| a_n\\in\\{0,2\\} \\text{ for all }n\\in\\mathbb{N} \\} $ where the decimal expansion is in base $3$. Let $x=0.a_1a_2a_3...$ $\\space$ be a ternary expansion of $x$ My strategy is this: Prove that $a_n=1 \\iff x\\notin A_n$ (a) Proceed by induction on $n$.  For $n=1$ we have: $a_1 = 1 \\iff \\frac{1}{3} \\le  x < \\frac{2}{3} \\iff x \\notin A_1$ Assume it's true for $n$ that is:$\\space a_n = 1 \\iff x \\notin A_n$. For $n+1$ we have: $a_{n+1}=1 \\iff \\text{there's some integer $m$ such that:} \\frac{1}{3} \\le 3^{n}x - m  < \\frac{2}{3} $ Furthermore $m = a_1a_2a_3...a_{n}$ (in base 3 digit expansion). Here i got stuck.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $F_1 = [0,\\frac{1}{3}] \\cup [\\frac{2}{3},1]$ $F_2 = [0,\\frac{1}{3^2}] \\cup [\\frac{2}{3^2},\\frac{3}{3^2}] \\cup [\\frac{6}{3^2},\\frac{7}{3^2}] \\cup [\\frac{8}{3^2},1]$ and so on.\nThe Cantor set is then $C=\\bigcap^{\\infty}_{k=1} F_k$. Each $x \\in C$ can be written in the form $ x = \\frac{a_0}{3} + \\frac{a_1}{3^2} + \\frac{a_2}{3^3} + ...+ \\frac{a_n}{3^{n+1}}+ ...$ By Construction, if $x\\in F_k$ and $0 \\leq j < k$, then $3^jx=a+y$ where $a \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}$ (*) and $y \\in F_{k-j}$. Noting this pattern suppose $x\\in C$ therefore $x \\in F_k$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Now assume that for some $m\\in \\mathbb{N}$  we have $a_m = 1$ Then we have $3^mx=a+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{a_{m+1}}{3^2}+\\frac{a_{m+2}}{3^3}+...\\ \\ \\ \\Leftrightarrow$  $ \\ \\ \\ \\ y=3^mx-a \\notin F_1 \\Leftrightarrow x \\notin F_{m+1} \\Leftrightarrow x \\notin C$ contradiction. To see the pattern more clearly, consider $F_3$, $F_3= [0,\\frac{1}{27}] \\cup [\\frac{2}{27},\\frac{3}{27}] \\cup [\\frac{6}{27},\\frac{7}{27}]\\cup [\\frac{8}{27},\\frac{9}{27}]\\cup [\\frac{18}{27},\\frac{19}{27}]\\cup [\\frac{20}{27},\\frac{21}{27}] \\cup [\\frac{24}{27},\\frac{25}{27}] \\cup [\\frac{26}{27},1]$ Define the \"multiplication\" of an interval by an scalar, naturally by multiplying the endpoints by that scalar, for example $3F_2=  [0,\\frac{3}{9}] \\cup [\\frac{6}{9},1] \\cup  [\\frac{18}{9},\\frac{21}{9}] \\cup [\\frac{24}{9},3]=[0,\\frac{1}{3}] \\cup [\\frac{2}{3},1] \\cup  [2,\\frac{7}{3}] \\cup [\\frac{8}{3},3]$ This multiplication is important, since it gives us 2 copies of $F_1$, (the 2nd copy is a translation of $F_1$ by an integer, look at (*) ) More generally, $3^jF_k$ gives us $2^j$ copies of $F_{k-j}$ let $x \\in F_3$ For $j=0 \\ \\ \\ $, the statement is clear, i.e. $3^0x \\in F_{3-0} \\Rightarrow x \\in F_3$ Trivial !

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the core problem from the original question.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the Cantor set C is equivalent to the set of numbers with ternary expansions consisting only of 0s and 2s. The user mentions the construction of the Cantor set through the intersection of sets A_n, where each A_n is obtained by removing the middle third from A_{n-1}. \n\nThe problem statement in the question is to show that C is exactly those numbers whose ternary expansions have only 0s and 2s. The user's strategy involves proving that a digit a_n is 1 if and only if x is not in A_n, using induction. They got stuck at the induction step for n+1.\n\nNow, to format this into the required structure. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove the equality between the Cantor set and the ternary expansion set.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing a single property. Here, the Cantor set is defined as the intersection of A_n, each A_n is built by removing the middle third from A_{n-1}, and the ternary expansion condition. The problem is to show the equality between these two sets.\n\nI need to ensure that the assumptions are correctly extracted. The user defines C as the intersection over all natural numbers n of A_n, where each A_n is constructed by removing the middle third from the previous A_{n-1}. The other part is the definition of the set with ternary digits 0 and 2. So the assumptions would be each of these definitions, and the problem is to prove C equals that set.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be the definitions of C and the ternary expansion set. Each assumption is a separate line. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem's assumptions:\n\n1. A_0 = [0,1].\n2. For each n, A_n is obtained by removing the middle third of each interval in A_{n-1}.\n3. C is the intersection of all A_n for n in natural numbers.\n4. The set to compare is {x = 0.a1a2a3... (base 3) | each a_n is 0 or 2}.\n\nEach of these should be separate assumptions. The problem is to prove C equals that set of numbers with ternary digits 0 and 2.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user's formatted problem included only some assumptions. Wait, the original example had the problem being to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had written \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted version, the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that's conflicting. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which should not require n to be divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the example provided by the user is incorrect. But regardless, the user's example is as such, so perhaps the assumptions in the example were incorrect. But the user wants me to follow their example's structure.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question is to prove that the Cantor set C equals the set of numbers with ternary digits 0 and 2. The assumptions would be the definitions of C and the ternary set.\n\nSo applying the format:\n\nAssumption: Each line is a single property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA_0 is the interval [0, 1],\nFor each natural number n, A_n is obtained by removing the middle third of each interval in A_{n-1},\nC is the intersection of all A_n for n in natural numbers,\nThe set of numbers x with ternary expansion 0.a1a2a3... where each a_n is 0 or 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that C equals the set of numbers with ternary expansions consisting of 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was restated, even if some assumptions were part of the problem's given. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions given in the problem, and the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nSo the user's original problem is structured as:\n\nOriginal question: Prove that C (defined as the intersection of A_n) equals the set of numbers with ternary digits 0 and 2.\n\nSo the assumptions would be the definitions of A_n and C, and the problem is to show the equality.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would list each part of the definition step by step. Each assumption line is one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA_0 is defined as the interval [0, 1],\nFor each natural number n, A_n is defined as A_{n-1} with its middle third removed,\nC is defined as the intersection of all A_n for n in natural numbers,\nx is a number with a ternary expansion 0.a1a2a3... where each a_n is either 0 or 2.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that C is equal to that set of numbers. So perhaps the last line is not an assumption, but part of the problem. Wait, the problem statement is to prove that C equals that set, so the assumptions are the definitions of C (A_0, A_n, intersection), and the other set is defined, but perhaps not an assumption but part of the problem.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7, which was not part of the original problem's statement. Wait, in the original example, the user had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That contradicts. So maybe the example is flawed. However, the user provided that example, so perhaps in their formatting, they included not only the given problem's conditions but also possibly other assumptions. However, in the current problem, the user's original question is to prove that C equals the ternary set. The assumptions would be the definitions of C (A_0, A_n, intersection) and the other set's definition. But perhaps in the problem statement, the user wants to structure the problem as \"Prove that C equals {x=0.a1a2a3... | a_n ∈ {0,2}}\".\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as the definitions leading to C and the problem as proving the equality. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA_0 is the interval [0, 1],\nFor each natural number n, A_n is equal to A_{n-1} with its middle third removed,\nC is the intersection of all A_n over n in natural numbers,\nx has a ternary expansion 0.a1a2a3... where each a_n is either 0 or 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that C is equal to the set of all such x with ternary expansions consisting of 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but the set of x with ternary expansions 0s and 2s is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions are only the definitions leading up to C. Then the problem is to show that C equals that set. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA_0 is the interval [0, 1],\nFor each natural number n, A_n is equal to A_{n-1} with its middle third removed,\nC is the intersection of all A_n for n in natural numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that C equals the set of numbers x in [0,1] whose ternary expansion is 0.a1a2a3... with each a_n ∈ {0, 2}.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The problem is to show the equality, and the assumptions are the construction of C. The other set's definition is part of the problem statement. So the problem is to prove that C is equal to that set. The assumptions are the steps defining C. Each line is a separate assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nA_0 is the interval [0, 1],\nFor each natural number n, A_n is defined as A_{n-1} with its middle third removed,\nC is the intersection of all A_n for all natural numbers n.\nProblem:\nProve that $$C = \\left\\{ x = 0.a_1a_2a_3\\ldots_{\\text{base }3} \\mid a_n \\in \\{0, 2\\} \\text{ for all } n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\}.$$\n###",
