    "Content": "Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space, $V_i$ is a proper subspace of $V$ for every $1\\leq i\\leq m$ for some integer $m$. In my linear algebra text, I've seen a result that $V$ can never be covered by $\\{V_i\\}$, but I don't know how to prove it correctly. I've written down my false proof below: First we may prove the result when $V_i$ is a codimension-1 subspace. Since $codim(V_i)=1$, we can pick a vector $e_i\\in V$ s.t. $V_i\\oplus\\mathcal{L}(e_i)=V$, where $\\mathcal{L}(v)$ is the linear subspace span by $v$. Then we choose $e=e_1+\\cdots+e_m$, I want to show that none of $V_i$ contains $e$ but I failed. Could you tell me a simple and corrected proof to this result? Ideas of proof are also welcome~ Remark : As @Jim Conant mentioned that this is possible for finite field, I assume the base field of $V$ to be a number field.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "[Edit] This answer is contained in another answer of mine. Sorry about that. Switching to CW[/Edit] Pick a basis and a system of coordinates $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ for $V$. WLOG assume that $n \\geq 2$. As you observed,\nwithout loss of generality we can assume that the subspaces are all of codimension one, i.e. spaces of solutions of a single homogeneous equation \n$$\na_1x_1+a_2x_2+\\cdots +a_nx_n=0\n$$\nin the coordinates $x_i,i=1,\\ldots,n$. Therefore a single subspace will intersect the infinite set\n$$\nS=\\{(1,t,t^2,\\ldots,t^{n-1})\\mid t\\in k\\}\n$$\nat finitely many points, because the polynomial $a_1+a_2t+a_3t^2+\\cdots+a_nt^{n-1}$ has at most $n-1$ zeros. Therefore it is impossible to cover all of $S$, hence all of $V$, with finitely many subspaces. Note that if $k$ is uncountable, then this argument shows that we need uncountably many subspaces.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question: The user mentions a finite-dimensional vector space V, proper subspaces V_i for i from 1 to m, and the result that V cannot be covered by these subspaces. The user also notes that the base field is assumed to be a number field because of the finite field exception mentioned.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include that V is a finite-dimensional vector space, each V_i is a proper subspace, m is some integer, and the base field is a number field (to exclude finite fields). Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property per object.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that V cannot be covered by the union of the V_i subspaces. I need to make sure that the problem is stated clearly, referencing the assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are the finite dimensionality, the properness of the subspaces, the number of subspaces being finite (m is an integer, so m is finite), and the base field being a number field. The original problem didn't explicitly state \"number field\" but the user added that in the remark to exclude finite fields. So that becomes an assumption.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- V is a finite-dimensional vector space,\n- Each V_i is a proper subspace of V for every 1 ≤ i ≤ m,\n- m is an integer,\n- The base field of V is a number field.\n\nProblem: Prove that V cannot be covered by the union of {V_i}_{i=1}^m.\n\nI should check if each assumption is one per line and applies to one object. The first assumption is about V's dimension. The second is about each V_i being proper. The third is about m being an integer (which implies finite). The fourth specifies the base field. Each is separate and addresses one property. That should fit the format.",
