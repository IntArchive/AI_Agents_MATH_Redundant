    "Content": "I am looking for the most concise and elegant proof of the following inequality:\n$$\nh(x) \\geq 1- \\left(1-\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^2, \\qquad \\forall x\\in(0,1)\n$$\nwhere $h(x) = x \\log_2\\frac{1}{x}+(1-x) \\log_2\\frac{1}{1-x}$ is the binary entropy function . Below is a graph of the two functions. Of course, an option would be to differentiate $1,2,\\dots,k$ times, and study the function this way — it may very well work, but is not only computationally cumbersome, it also feels utterly inelegant. (For my purposes, I could go this way, but I'd rather not.) I am looking for a clever or neat argument involving concavity, Taylor expansion around $1/2$, or anything — an approach that would qualify as \"proof from the Book.\"",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and extract the assumptions and the problem statement as per the example provided.\n\nThe original problem is about proving an inequality involving the binary entropy function. The title mentions the inequality: \\( x \\log_2\\frac{1}{x} + (1-x) \\log_2\\frac{1}{1-x} \\geq 1- \\left(1-\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^2 \\) for all \\( x \\in (0,1) \\). The question body reiterates this and mentions that \\( h(x) \\) is the binary entropy function. The user is looking for an elegant proof, possibly using concavity, Taylor expansion around 1/2, or another clever method.\n\nNow, following the example, I need to list the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem, the key elements are:\n\n1. \\( x \\) is in the interval \\( (0,1) \\). This is a domain assumption.\n2. \\( h(x) \\) is defined as the binary entropy function: \\( h(x) = x \\log_2\\frac{1}{x} + (1-x) \\log_2\\frac{1}{1-x} \\). This defines the function involved.\n3. The inequality to prove is \\( h(x) \\geq 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{1 - x}\\right)^2 \\). However, I should check if there's any other implicit assumption, like differentiability or concavity, but since the problem is to prove the inequality, the assumptions are primarily about the domain and the definition of \\( h(x) \\).\n\nWait, the original problem states \"for all \\( x \\in (0,1) \\)\", so that's one assumption. The definition of \\( h(x) \\) is another. The problem is to prove the inequality. The example given in the prompt had an assumption about \\( n \\) being an integer and divisible by 7, but here, the main assumptions are the domain of \\( x \\) and the definition of \\( h(x) \\). The problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( x \\) is a real number in the interval \\( (0,1) \\),\n- \\( h(x) \\) is defined as \\( x \\log_2\\frac{1}{x} + (1-x) \\log_2\\frac{1}{1-x} \\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( h(x) \\geq 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{1 - x}\\right)^2 \\) for all \\( x \\in (0,1) \\).\n\nWait, but in the example, they had two assumptions: one about \\( n \\) being integer and another about it being divisible by 7. Here, the original problem doesn't have additional constraints beyond \\( x \\in (0,1) \\). The function definition is part of the problem statement, but according to the example, the function definition might be considered as an assumption. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. \\( x \\) is in \\( (0,1) \\).\n2. \\( h(x) \\) is the binary entropy function defined as \\( x \\log_2\\frac{1}{x} + (1-x) \\log_2\\frac{1}{1-x} \\).\n\nThe problem is to prove the inequality. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these two assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions \"the binary entropy function,\" which is a standard function in information theory, but the definition is given, so no further assumptions needed. The inequality itself is the problem to prove. The example from the user included an assumption about divisibility by 7, but here, the key points are the domain and the function's definition.\n\nTherefore, the correct structured format would be as above. Let me verify once more.\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\nProve that \\( h(x) \\geq 1- \\left(1-\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^2 \\) for all \\( x \\in (0,1) \\), where \\( h(x) \\) is the binary entropy function defined as given.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the domain of \\( x \\) and the definition of \\( h(x) \\). The problem is to prove the inequality. There's no mention of any other constraints, so the assumptions are correctly captured.",
