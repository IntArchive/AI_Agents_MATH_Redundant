    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The question is about proving that a diffeomorphism between two surfaces in R³ is locally conformal if and only if it preserves angles. The user has already mentioned that the \"only if\" part is straightforward, but the \"if\" part needs to be proven. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that φ is a diffeomorphism between two surfaces S and Ŝ in R³. The definitions given are:\n\n1. Conformal map: For each p in S, the differential dφ_p preserves the inner product up to a scaling factor λ², which is a nowhere-zero function.\n2. Angle-preserving map: The cosine of the angle between any two tangent vectors v1, v2 at p is equal to the cosine of the angle between their images under dφ_p.\n\nThe problem is to prove that φ is locally conformal if and only if it's angle-preserving. The user is focusing on the \"if\" direction, i.e., angle-preserving implies conformal.\n\nNow, the assumptions here need to be listed. Each assumption should be a single property or condition on one object.\n\nSo, let's break down the given information:\n\n- φ is a diffeomorphism between S and Ŝ (both surfaces in R³).\n- For angle-preserving, the cosine equality holds for all p in S, and all tangent vectors v1, v2 in T_p(S).\n- The definition of conformal involves the existence of a nowhere-zero function λ such that the inner product under dφ is scaled by λ².\n\nBut the problem statement is to show equivalence between locally conformal and angle-preserving. The user is focusing on the \"if\" part: angle-preserving implies locally conformal.\n\nIn the original question, the user has already stated the definitions, so when structuring the problem, the assumptions would include the properties of φ, the surfaces, and the angle preservation. However, since the problem is to prove an equivalence given these definitions, the key assumptions here are the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n- φ: S → Ŝ is a diffeomorphism.\n- For every point p ∈ S, and all vectors v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), the cosine of the angle between v₁ and v₂ equals the cosine of the angle between dφ_p(v₁) and dφ_p(v₂).\n- The problem is to prove that φ is locally conformal (i.e., for each p, there exists a neighborhood where the conformal condition holds with some λ) if and only if φ preserves angles. However, since the user is focusing on the \"if\" part, maybe the assumption here is that φ is angle-preserving, and we need to show it's locally conformal.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were more about the objects involved and their properties. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn this case, the problem is an equivalence: \"Prove that φ is locally conformal if and only if it preserves angles.\" But the user is specifically asking about the \"if\" direction. However, when structuring the problem, maybe we should present the entire problem as stated, with the assumptions being the given conditions for the equivalence.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Prove that φ is locally conformal if and only if it preserves angles.\" So the problem is to prove both directions. The user mentions that the \"only if\" is obvious, but the \"if\" part is tricky. However, the problem as stated in the question is the full equivalence. So when structuring, the problem statement should be as such, and the assumptions would be the conditions given for φ, the surfaces, etc.\n\nBut the user's example only included the relevant assumptions for the problem. So here, the key assumptions are:\n\n- φ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces S and Ŝ in R³.\n- For angle-preserving, the cosine equality holds for all tangent vectors at every point.\n- The definition of conformal is given with the scaling factor λ.\n\nBut perhaps the main assumptions to list are:\n\n- φ: S → Ŝ is a diffeomorphism.\n- For all p ∈ S and all v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), the cosine of the angle between v₁ and v₂ is equal to that between dφ_p(v₁) and dφ_p(v₂).\n- The problem is to show that this angle preservation implies local conformality (existence of λ such that the inner product is scaled by λ² locally).\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's an equivalence. So maybe the assumptions should include both conditions (angle-preserving and locally conformal) as part of the equivalence, but the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nWait, no. The problem is to prove that φ is locally conformal if and only if it is angle-preserving. So the problem is the equivalence. The user is stuck on the \"if\" part (angle-preserving implies conformal). So when structuring the problem, the assumptions would be the given conditions for the problem, which are:\n\n- φ is a diffeomorphism between two surfaces in R³.\n- The definitions of conformal (inner product scaled by λ²) and angle-preserving (cosine equality).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions to list would be:\n\n- φ: S → Ŝ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces in ℝ³.\n- For every p ∈ S, and all v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), the angle between v₁ and v₂ is preserved under dφ_p.\n- Conformal maps satisfy ⟨dφ_p(v₁), dφ_p(v₂)⟩ = λ²⟨v₁, v₂⟩_p for some nowhere-zero function λ.\n\nBut the problem is to show equivalence between locally conformal and angle-preserving. However, the problem statement in the formatted example was concise. Let's look at the example again:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, with assumption that n is integer and divisible by 7. Then formatted problem lists those assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nIn this case, the user's original problem is to prove the equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- φ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces S and Ŝ in ℝ³.\n- φ preserves angles (as defined by the cosine equality).\n- Conformal maps are defined by the scaling of the inner product.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove φ is locally conformal iff it preserves angles.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem as structured should have the following assumptions:\n\nAssumption 1: φ: S → Ŝ is a diffeomorphism.\n\nAssumption 2: For all p ∈ S and v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), cos(v₁, v₂) = cos(dφ_p(v₁), dφ_p(v₂)).\n\nProblem: Prove that φ is locally conformal.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the equivalence, but the user is focusing on the \"if\" part. However, the original question as presented includes the full problem: Prove that φ is locally conformal if and only if it preserves angles. So perhaps the formatted problem should capture the entire equivalence, but the user is asking specifically about the \"if\" direction.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the original problem, filtered unrelated information, and listed assumptions line by line, then the problem.\n\nIn the original problem here, the question is to prove the equivalence. The user provides definitions for conformal and angle-preserving. The problem statement from do Carmo is to prove the equivalence. The user mentions that the \"only if\" is obvious, but the \"if\" part is the challenge.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, perhaps we need to present the problem as stated: prove the equivalence. But maybe the user wants only the \"if\" part? Wait, the original question's title is \"Proof that angle-preserving map is conformal\", so perhaps the focus is on the direction that angle-preserving implies conformal. However, the problem as posed in do Carmo is the full equivalence.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, they want the problem structured as per the example. So in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assistant added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, actually in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps that example was a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That would actually change the problem. Maybe that example is incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to have that, maybe the original problem had a different setup. Hmm, but regardless, we need to follow the user's example.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the assistant in the example broke down the problem's conditions into individual assumptions. So for the current problem, we need to list all the assumptions given in the problem.\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\nLet φ: S → Ŝ be a diffeomorphism between two surfaces in ℝ³. Such a map is called conformal if for all p ∈ S, and v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), ⟨dφ_p(v₁), dφ_p(v₂)⟩ = λ²⟨v₁, v₂⟩_p for some nowhere-zero function λ. φ is angle-preserving if the cosine of the angle between vectors is preserved. The problem is to prove φ is locally conformal if and only if it preserves angles.\n\nSo assumptions for the problem would include:\n\n- φ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces S and Ŝ in ℝ³.\n\n- Conformal maps satisfy the inner product scaling condition.\n\n- Angle-preserving maps satisfy the cosine equality.\n\nBut since the problem is an equivalence, the assumptions would be the given definitions and conditions. To structure the problem according to the example, the assumptions should list each property or condition applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, line by line:\n\nAssumption:\nφ: S → Ŝ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces in ℝ³.\nFor every point p ∈ S and all tangent vectors v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), the differential dφ_p preserves the cosine of the angle between v₁ and v₂.\nA conformal map satisfies ⟨dφ_p(v₁), dφ_p(v₂)⟩ = λ²⟨v₁, v₂⟩_p for some nowhere-zero function λ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that φ is locally conformal if and only if it is angle-preserving.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, the example given by the user had a problem where the assumption included a condition not originally in the problem statement (divisible by 7). Wait, but in the example, maybe there was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by both 7 and 13, but in the example, the user's formatted problem added n divisible by 7 as an assumption. That seems conflicting. But maybe the example is incorrect. However, regardless, the user wants us to structure the problem as per the example.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- φ is a diffeomorphism between two surfaces in ℝ³.\n\n- For every p ∈ S and v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), the cosine of the angle between v₁ and v₂ is preserved under dφ_p.\n\n- Conformal maps are defined by the existence of λ such that the inner product is scaled by λ².\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\", but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error unless there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the original problem in the example had a typo, and the formatted problem corrects it. But since we have to follow the user's example, perhaps we need to list the assumptions given in the problem statement, breaking them into individual lines.\n\nTherefore, in this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\nφ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces S and Ŝ in ℝ³.\n\nFor all p ∈ S and v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), the angle between v₁ and v₂ is preserved under dφ_p (cosine equality holds).\n\nA conformal map satisfies ⟨dφ_p(v₁), dφ_p(v₂)⟩ = λ²⟨v₁, v₂⟩_p for a nowhere-zero function λ.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that φ is locally conformal if and only if it preserves angles.\n\nBut the original problem from do Carmo is asking for the equivalence, so the problem statement should remain as is. The user is specifically asking about the \"if\" part, but the formatted problem should present the entire problem as stated. So the answer should list the assumptions as per the problem's setup and then the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove that if φ preserves angles, then it is locally conformal. The original problem states the equivalence, but the user is focusing on the \"if\" direction. However, the problem as given in the title is \"Proof that angle-preserving map is conformal\", which is the \"if\" direction. But the problem from do Carmo is the full equivalence.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, we need to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the original problem, filtered unrelated info, listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nOriginal problem states that φ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces in R³. Defined conformal as preserving inner product up to scaling λ², angle-preserving as preserving the cosine of angles. Problem: Prove equivalence between locally conformal and angle-preserving.\n\nAssumptions to list:\n\nEach assumption should be a single line, one property per line, applied to one object.\n\n- φ: S → Ŝ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces in ℝ³.\n- For every p ∈ S and all vectors v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), the differential dφ_p preserves the cosine of the angle between v₁ and v₂.\n- A map is conformal if for each p ∈ S, there exists a function λ(p) ≠ 0 such that ⟨dφ_p(v₁), dφ_p(v₂)⟩ = λ(p)²⟨v₁, v₂⟩_p for all v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S).\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that φ is locally conformal if and only if it preserves angles.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included conditions on the object (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So here, the assumptions are about φ being a diffeomorphism, preserving angles, and the definition of conformal. However, the problem is an equivalence, so the assumptions are the premises needed to state the problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is an equivalence, maybe the assumptions are the properties given for φ, and the problem is to show equivalence. But in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7, which actually changes the original problem's statement. It's possible the example was incorrect, but we have to follow it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this problem, the key assumptions are that φ is a diffeomorphism and angle-preserving, and the problem is to prove it's locally conformal. But the original problem is an equivalence, so maybe we need to structure it as such.\n\nBut given the user's example, perhaps the assumptions should include:\n\n- φ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces in ℝ³.\n- φ preserves angles (as per the cosine equality).\n- Locally conformal maps satisfy the inner product scaling condition.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nHowever, the example included assumptions that weren't all in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that maybe the assistant in the example made a mistake, or perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption. But since we have to proceed, I'll structure the current problem by listing the given conditions as assumptions.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces S and Ŝ in ℝ³.\nFor every p ∈ S and all v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), the cosine of the angle between v₁ and v₂ is equal to the cosine of the angle between dφ_p(v₁) and dφ_p(v₂).\nA conformal map satisfies ⟨dφ_p(v₁), dφ_p(v₂)⟩ = λ²⟨v₁, v₂⟩_p for some nowhere-zero function λ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that φ is locally conformal if and only if it preserves angles.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions should be listed line by line, each as one property. So maybe split the conformal map definition into the existence of λ, but that's part of the definition.\n\nAlternatively, to break down each assumption:\n\nAssumption:\nφ: S → Ŝ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces in ℝ³.\nFor every point p ∈ S and vectors v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S), cos(v₁, v₂) = cos(dφ_p(v₁), dφ_p(v₂)).\nFor a conformal map, there exists a function λ: S → ℝ \\ {0} such that ⟨dφ_p(v₁), dφ_p(v₂)⟩ = λ(p)²⟨v₁, v₂⟩_p for all p ∈ S, v₁, v₂ ∈ T_p(S).\n\nProblem:\nProve that φ is locally conformal if and only if it is angle-preserving.\n\nThis seems to capture all the necessary conditions.
