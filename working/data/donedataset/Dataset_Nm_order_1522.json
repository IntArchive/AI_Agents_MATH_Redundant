    "AcceptedAnswer": "Set\n$$\nX=\\begin{bmatrix}A & C\\\\0 & B\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nIf $A$ is not invertible, then its columns are linearly dependent, hence the first $m$ columns of $X$ are linearly dependent and also $X$ is not invertible. In this case the relation $\\det X=\\det A\\det B$ is true. So we can assume $A$ is invertible; if Gaussian elimination on $A$ requires row switches, then collect all row switches in a permutation matrix $P$, so elimination on $PA$ can be done without row switches and $PA=LU$ where $L$ is lower triangular and $U$ is upper unitriangular. Consider the matrix\n$$P'=\\begin{bmatrix}P & 0 \\\\ 0 & I_n\\end{bmatrix}$$\nso\n$$\nP'X=\n\\begin{bmatrix}P & 0 \\\\ 0 & I_n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}A & C\\\\0 & B\\end{bmatrix}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}PA&PC\\\\0&B\\end{bmatrix}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}LU&PC\\\\0&B\\end{bmatrix}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}L & 0 \\\\ 0 & I_n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}U & L^{-1}PC\\\\0 & B\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, as\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}L & 0 \\\\ 0 & I_n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nis lower triangular, we clearly have that its determinant is equal to $\\det L$. Since $U$ is upper unitriangular, with $m$ times repeated Laplace development we get that\n$$\n\\det\\begin{bmatrix}U & L^{-1}PC\\\\0 & B\\end{bmatrix}=\\det B\n$$\nTherefore\n$$\n\\det P'X=\\det P'\\det X=\\det L\\det B\n$$\nOn the other hand, $P'$ is a permutation matrix generated by as many row swaps as $P$, so $\\det P=\\det P'$. Also $\\det A=\\det L\\det U=\\det L$. Hence $\\det X=\\det A\\det B$. We can also do it by induction. For $i=1,2,\\dots,m$, denote by $A_i$ the matrix obtained from $A$ by removing the first column and the $i$-th row; $C_i$ is the matrix obtained from $C$ by removing the $i$-th row. The base case of induction is for $m=1$, which is obvious.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the determinant of an upper triangular block matrix is the product of the determinants of the diagonal blocks using induction. The user provided a detailed solution attempt and is asking if it's correct.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The problem statement mentions that the matrix is an upper triangular block matrix with blocks A, C, 0, and B. The matrices A and B are square matrices of sizes m×m and n×n respectively, and R is a commutative ring with 1. The user's solution involves induction on m and n.\n\nLooking at the assumptions, the key points are:\n1. A is an m×m matrix over R.\n2. C is an m×n matrix over R.\n3. B is an n×n matrix over R.\n4. R is a commutative ring with 1.\n5. The matrix L is a block matrix with A and B on the diagonal, C in the upper right, and a zero matrix in the lower left.\n6. The proof uses mathematical induction on the dimensions m and n.\n\nEach assumption should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, breaking it down:\n\n- A is an element of M_{m×m}(R) (the set of m×m matrices over R)\n- C is an element of M_{m×n}(R)\n- B is an element of M_{n×n}(R)\n- R is a commutative ring with 1\n- The matrix L is a block matrix of the form [[A, C], [0, B]] where 0 is the zero matrix\n- The proof uses induction on the dimensions m and n (though the problem itself is to prove the determinant formula, so maybe the induction is part of the solution attempt rather than an assumption? The user is asking if their inductive proof is correct. But the problem statement itself doesn't specify induction as a requirement, so maybe the induction is part of their approach. Since the task is to structure the problem as per the example, perhaps the induction isn't an assumption but part of the solution. The assumptions are the given conditions of the problem, not the method used in the proof. So the problem's assumptions are about the matrices and the ring, not the induction method.)\n\nSo the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- A is an m×m matrix over R.\n- C is an m×n matrix over R.\n- B is an n×n matrix over R.\n- R is a commutative ring with 1.\n- The matrix L is a block upper triangular matrix with A and B on the diagonal and 0 below.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"Prove that det(L) = det(A)det(B)\" given that L is this block matrix. So the assumptions are the properties of L, A, B, C, and R.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list each of these properties separately:\n\n1. A is an element of M_{m×m}(R).\n2. C is an element of M_{m×n}(R).\n3. B is an element of M_{n×n}(R).\n4. R is a commutative ring with 1.\n5. The matrix L is a block matrix of the form [[A, C], [0, B]], where 0 is the m×n zero matrix.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove that det(L) equals det(A)det(B).\n\nNow, checking the example provided: in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove the divisibility. So in this case, the problem's assumptions are the setup for the theorem to be proven.\n\nThe user's question is whether their induction proof is correct. But according to the task, we need to structure the problem as per the format, not evaluate the solution. So we need to present the problem as it's originally asked, filtering out the solution attempt and other unrelated information.\n\nThe original question's title is \"Upper Triangular Block Matrix Determinant by induction\", and the problem is to prove the determinant formula. The user then presents their solution attempt, but the core problem is to prove det([[A, C], [0, B]]) = det(A)det(B) where A, B are square matrices over a commutative ring R with 1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions about A, B, C, R, and the structure of L, then state the problem as proving the determinant formula.\n\nThe user's induction approach is part of their solution attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. So in the assumptions, we need to include:\n\n- A ∈ M_{m×m}(R)\n- C ∈ M_{m×n}(R)\n- B ∈ M_{n×n}(R)\n- R is a commutative ring with 1\n- L is the block matrix [[A, C], [0, B]]\n\nEach as separate points. Then the problem is to prove det(L) = det(A)det(B).\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The user's solution attempt mentions induction on m and n, but that's their method, not part of the problem's given conditions. The problem itself doesn't specify to use induction; the user is using induction and asking if it's correct. Therefore, the problem as posed is to prove the determinant formula, with the given assumptions about the matrices and the ring.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an element of M_{m×m}(R),\nC is an element of M_{m×n}(R),\nB is an element of M_{n×n}(R),\nR is a commutative ring with 1,\nL is the block matrix formed by [[A, C], [0, B]].\n\nProblem:\nProve that det(L) = det(A)det(B).\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the problem as stated by the user here, the determinant formula's validity holds for any m, n, and commutative ring R with 1. So the assumptions are the general conditions under which the problem is posed.\n\nYes, that's correct. The user's problem is to prove the determinant formula under these general conditions. Their solution attempt uses induction, but the problem itself doesn't specify the method. So the formatted problem should capture the original question's core, which is to prove the determinant identity for block upper triangular matrices over a commutative ring.",
