    "AcceptedAnswer": "If we put $a=\\sqrt{x}$ and $b=\\sqrt{y}$, the degree two equation (in $z$)\n$x^2+y^2+z^2-2(xy+xz+yz)=0$ has two solutions, $(a-b)^2$ and $(a+b)^2$. By\ncyclically permuting $x,y,z$, we may assume $z=(a+b)^2$. The inequality\nto be shown is then equivalent to $(x+y+z)^3 \\geq 54xyz$, or\n$(a^2+b^2+(a+b)^2)^3 \\geq 54(a^2b^2(a+b)^2)$. We are then done because $$\n(a^2+b^2+(a+b)^2)^3 -54(a^2b^2(a+b)^2)=2\\Bigg((b-a)(2a+b)(a+2b)\\Bigg)^2\n$$ As guessed by CalvinLin, equality is reached exactly when\n$(x,y,z)=(1,1,4)$ up to permutation.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem according to the specified format. Let's look at the example provided to understand the requirements.\n\nIn the example, the original problem is about proving a number is divisible by 91. The formatted version lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem is restated.\n\nNow, the problem at hand is from an Iranian Olympiad. The question states:\n\nIf:\nx² + y² + z² = 2(xy + xz + yz)\nand x, y, z are positive real numbers. Prove that (x + y + z)/3 ≥ cube root of (2xyz).\n\nThe user tried solving it but couldn't. Let me parse this.\n\nFirst, list the assumptions. The problem gives two conditions: the equation x² + y² + z² = 2(xy + xz + yz) and that x, y, z are positive reals. These are separate assumptions. The example split the assumptions into separate lines, each with one condition. So here, we have two assumptions: one is the equation, and the other is that x, y, z are positive real numbers. Wait, but in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\" and the second \"n is divisible by 7\". But here, the equation involves all three variables, so maybe the first assumption is the equation, and the second is that x, y, z are positive reals. Each on a separate line.\n\nSo, following the format:\n\nAssumption:\nx, y, z are positive real numbers,\nx² + y² + z² = 2(xy + xz + yz).\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x + y + z)/3 ≥ ∛(2xyz).\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote the equation first and then mentioned x, y, z ∈ R⁺. So perhaps the order should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx² + y² + z² = 2(xy + xz + yz),\nx, y, z are positive real numbers.\n\nBut need to check if the example structured assumptions in the order given. The example's original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", and then the formatted assumption had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example, the problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted assumption split into two: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that might not be correct. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was a wrong example? Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumptions add that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original problem. So that might be an error in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show that assumptions can be split into multiple conditions, even if they are not all given explicitly. Wait, maybe in that example, the original problem actually had an error, and the correct assumptions required n to be divisible by 7? Because 91 is 13*7, so maybe the problem requires n to satisfy a certain divisibility condition. But the user's example shows that the original problem was phrased as \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, it's split into n is an integer and n divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. However, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow their structure regardless.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The user provided:\n\nOriginal question:\n\nIf:\nx² + y² + z² = 2(xy + xz + yz)\nand x, y, z ∈ R⁺. Prove: (x + y + z)/3 ≥ ∛(2xyz)\n\nSo the two given conditions are the equation and the positivity of variables. So in the formatted version, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx, y, z are positive real numbers,\nx² + y² + z² = 2(xy + xz + yz).\n\nProblem: Prove that (x + y + z)/3 ≥ ∛(2xyz).\n\nThat should be correct. Each assumption is one line, addressing one condition. The first is about the variables being positive reals, the second is the equation they satisfy.\n\nNow, the user wants me to structure the problem in that way. So the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nx, y, z are positive real numbers,\nx² + y² + z² = 2(xy + xz + yz).\nProblem: \nProve that $\\frac{x+y+z}{3} \\ge \\sqrt[3]{2xyz}$.",
