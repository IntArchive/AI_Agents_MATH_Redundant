    "Content": "This is a generalization of problem A1 from the 2009 Putnam competition. The original problem asks for proof that any function $f:\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that sums to zero over the vertices of any square is necessarily zero everywhere. That is, if for any square with vertices $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , and $D$ , \\begin{equation}\nf(A)+f(B)+f(C)+f(D)=0\n\\end{equation} then $f(P)=0$ for any point $P\\in \\mathbb{R}^2.$ You can find the solution to this question here: Putnam 2009 A1 Points in a plane . My question is whether this result can be generalized to any family of similar polygons. If $\\Sigma_{i}f(A_i)=0$ whenever $A_1,...,A_n$ are the vertices of a polygon similar to a given polygon, does $f$ need to be $0$ everywhere? This can be proven for regular $n$ -gons by a method I describe in the comments. The proof for equilateral triangles amounts to adding the vertices of the three blue equilateral triangles in the picture and then subtracting the vertices of the the two red triangles leaving $3f(A)=0$ and, since $A$ is arbitrary, proving $f$ is zero everywhere. Essentially the same argument applies to any $n$ -gons if you draw them evenly arranged around the center point. It doesn't matter if they overlap.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To visualize what subrosar probably meant with his \"regular $n$ -gon\"-technique, I created the following picture for the case of the 7-gon In his post, subrosar used the same technique for the triangle. You create $n$ copies of the $n$ -gone, so that they all meat in a single vertex, and you arrange them in a symmetric pattern (the black 7-gons in the picture).\nYou then \"cancel out\" all vertices but the central one by inserting further concentric $n$ -gons. This works similar for all regular $n$ -gons, but it is best seen for odd $n$ , as then no additional vertices coincide. This technique can be generalized to polygons in which all vertices lie on a common circle, e.g. for this irregular 5-gon: And in fact, there is an even more general way to do this that works for all polygons, convex and non-convex: Let $P$ be a polygon with vertices $v_1,...,v_n$ . Choose a point $x\\in\\Bbb R^2$ that is not a vertex of $P$ . Now, for each vertex $v_i$ of $P$ , place a polygon $P_i$ in $\\Bbb R^2$ , that is congruent to $P$ (by rotation and scaling, no mirroring), and has its vertex $v_1^i$ (its version of the vertex $v_1$ ) at $x$ , and its vertex $v_2^i$ at $v_i$ . The points $\\{v_k^i\\mid i=2,...,n\\}$ now form the vertices of a polygon $\\bar P_k$ , that is congruent to $P$ . If $x$ is choosen to be the circumcenter of the polygon and all vertices of the polygon are on that circumcircle, we just obtain the same technique as above. So, indeed, the task can be stated with any polygon (or if you want so, with any set of points of size at least three).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand exactly what the user is asking. The original problem was about functions that sum to zero over the vertices of any square, leading to the conclusion that the function must be zero everywhere. Now, the user wants to generalize this to any family of similar polygons. So the question is: if a function f: R² → R sums to zero over the vertices of every polygon similar to a given polygon, must f be identically zero?\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and extract the key assumptions and structure them properly. The original problem's assumption was that for any square, the sum of f over its vertices is zero. The problem was to prove f is zero everywhere. The generalization here replaces squares with any similar polygon. So the assumptions should include that the function sums to zero over the vertices of any polygon similar to a given one. The problem is to determine if f must be zero everywhere under this condition.\n\nThe example given in the user's formatting had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. In this case, the key assumption is that the function sums to zero over all similar polygons. So the assumption here is that for any polygon similar to a given polygon, the sum of f over its vertices is zero. The problem is to prove that f is identically zero.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not including any extra information that's not part of the core assumptions. The original problem mentions the Putnam competition, but that's background info. The example provided by the user includes the specific function and conditions, but here the assumptions are about the function's behavior over similar polygons. The user's own explanation talks about regular n-gons and a method involving adding and subtracting vertices, but that's part of their reasoning, not the problem's assumptions. So those details shouldn't be in the formatted problem.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have one assumption: that the function sums to zero over the vertices of any polygon similar to a given polygon. The problem is to prove that f is identically zero. Let me check if there's any other implicit assumption. The original problem specifies that the function is from R² to R, which is important because the domain and codomain are part of the function's definition. So that should be included as an assumption.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem's formatted version included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the function's domain and codomain are part of the problem's setup. So in the assumptions, we need to state that f is a function from R² to R. Then, the key condition is that for any polygon similar to a given polygon, the sum over its vertices is zero. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a function from R² to R.\n2. For any polygon similar to a given polygon, the sum of f over its vertices is zero.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that f is identically zero.\n\nWait, but in the original example, they split the assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the first assumption is about the function's domain and codomain. The second is about the condition on the sum over similar polygons. So the formatted problem should list these two assumptions line by line.\n\nThe original problem's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Similarly, here, \"f is a function from R² to R\" is one assumption, and the sum condition is another. So that's two assumptions. The problem is then to prove f is zero everywhere.\n\nLet me check if there's any other implicit assumption. For example, the original problem mentions \"any square,\" which in the formatted example became part of the problem statement. In the user's question here, the condition is \"whenever A₁,...,A_n are the vertices of a polygon similar to a given polygon.\" So the given polygon is fixed, and we consider all polygons similar to it. So the assumption is that the sum is zero for any such polygon. Therefore, the key conditions are:\n\nAssumption:\nf: R² → R,\nFor any polygon similar to a given polygon, the sum of f over its vertices is zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is identically zero.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user also mentioned the example with regular n-gons and their method, but that's part of their reasoning, not part of the problem's assumptions. So we don't include that. The problem is purely about whether the sum condition for similar polygons implies f is zero everywhere. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as proving f is zero.",
