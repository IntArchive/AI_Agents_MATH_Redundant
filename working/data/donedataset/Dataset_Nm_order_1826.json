    "AcceptedAnswer": "Edit : Note that $f$ is continuous. (Why?) Define $$g(x)=\\lVert f(x)-x\\rVert$$ for all $x\\in K$. Use the compactness of $K$ to show that $g$ obtains a non-negative minimum. If $f$ has no fixed point, we can then derive a contradiction. (Apologies for my earlier, bogus approach.) You can further show that $f$ has a unique fixed point, if you like.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given problem into the specified structure. The example provided shows that the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that a contraction map on a compact normed space has a fixed point. Let me parse the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that K is a compact normed space. So that's one assumption: K is a compact normed space. Then, the function f maps K to K, so the second assumption is f: K → K. The next condition is the contraction part: the norm of f(x) - f(y) is less than the norm of x - y for all x, y in K with x ≠ y. That's another assumption. \n\nWait, but in the example, each assumption is a single line. So I need to split them into individual conditions. Let me check the problem again:\n\n\"Let K be a compact normed space and f:K→K such that ||f(x)-f(y)|| < ||x - y|| for all x, y in K, x ≠ y. Prove that f has a fixed point.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. K is a compact normed space.\n2. f is a function from K to K.\n3. For all x, y in K with x ≠ y, ||f(x) - f(y)|| < ||x - y||.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The first one is about K being compact and a normed space. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So maybe \"K is a normed space\" and \"K is compact\" should be separate? But the problem says \"compact normed space,\" which is a single property (since a compact normed space is a normed space that is compact as a metric space). However, in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, it seems the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem under assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants to follow that structure regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but the instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. In the example, the original problem's assumption is \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem has two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't have the divisibility condition. That suggests maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants to follow that style. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem where the user had to extract assumptions. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example had a mistake. But regardless, the user's instruction is to follow that format.\n\nSo, going back to the current problem. The problem states that K is a compact normed space. So first assumption: K is a compact normed space. Then, f: K → K. Then, the contraction condition. However, in the example, they split properties even if they are part of the same sentence. So in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which in the formatted problem becomes two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in reality, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption? That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants to follow it. However, in our current problem, we need to accurately represent the assumptions given in the original problem.\n\nThe original problem here is:\n\n\"Let K be a compact normed space and f:K→K such that ||f(x)-f(y)|| < ||x - y|| for all x, y in K, x ≠ y. Prove that f has a fixed point.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. K is a compact normed space.\n2. f: K → K is a function.\n3. For all x, y in K with x ≠ y, ||f(x) - f(y)|| < ||x - y||.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So in the formatted problem, each should be a line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a compact normed space,\nf is a function from K to K,\nfor all x, y in K with x ≠ y, ||f(x) - f(y)|| < ||x - y||.\n\nProblem: Prove that f has a fixed point.\n\nI think that's accurate. The example had splitting into separate lines even if the original problem combined them. So even though \"compact normed space\" is a single term, it's written as one line. Similarly, the contraction condition is written as one line even though it's a for all statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$K$ is a compact normed space,\n$f$ is a function from $K$ to $K$,\nfor all $x, y \\in K$ with $x \\neq y$, $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| < \\|x - y\\|$.\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ has a fixed point.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
