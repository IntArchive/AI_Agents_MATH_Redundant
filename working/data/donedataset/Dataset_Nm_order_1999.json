    "Content": "As title. Can anyone supply a simple proof that $$x \\Phi(x) + \\Phi'(x) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall x\\in\\mathbb{R}$$ where $\\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF, i.e. $$\\Phi(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-y^2/2} {\\rm d} y$$ I have so far: Defining $f(x) = x \\Phi(x) + \\Phi'(x)$ we get $$\n\\begin{align}\nf'(x) & = \\Phi(x) + x \\Phi'(x) + \\Phi''(x) \\\\\n& = \\Phi(x) + x\\Phi'(x) - x\\Phi'(x) \\\\\n& = \\Phi(x) \\\\\n& >0\n\\end{align}$$ so it seems that if we can show $$\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = 0$$ then we have our proof - am I correct? Clearly $f$ is the sum of two terms which tend to zero, so maybe I have all the machinery I require, and I just need to connect the parts in the right way! Assistance will be gratefully received. In case anyone is interested in where this question comes from: Bachelier's formula for an option struck at $K$ with time $T$ until maturity, with volatility $\\sigma>0$ and current asset price $S$ is given by $$V(S) = (S - K) \\Phi\\left( \\frac{S-K}{\\sigma S \\sqrt{T}} \\right) + \\sigma S \\sqrt{T} \\Phi' \\left( \\frac{S-K}{\\sigma S \\sqrt{T}} \\right) $$ Working in time units where $\\sigma S\\sqrt{T} = 1$ and letting $x=S-K$, we have $$V(x) = x \\Phi(x) + \\Phi'(x)$$ and I wanted a simple proof that $V(x)>0$ $\\forall x$, i.e. an option always has positive value under Bachelier's model.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user wants to prove that xΦ(x) + Φ’(x) is greater than or equal to zero for all real x, where Φ is the standard normal CDF. They mentioned defining f(x) = xΦ(x) + Φ’(x), then computed the derivative f’(x) and found it equals Φ(x), which is positive. They also considered the limit as x approaches negative infinity of f(x) and think it's zero. The problem comes from Bachelier's option pricing formula, but I need to filter that out as per the example.\n\nFirst, list the assumptions. The problem states \"for all x in real numbers,\" so one assumption is x is a real number. Φ is defined as the standard normal CDF, which is another assumption. Also, Φ’(x) is the derivative, which is the normal PDF, so that's another condition. But maybe the key assumptions here are about the properties of Φ and its derivative. Let me see the example again. The example listed each assumption line by line, applied to one object.\n\nSo here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n- Φ’(x) is the derivative of Φ(x), which is the standard normal probability density function.\n- x is a real number.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they split the assumptions into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, maybe we need to list each property. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"for all x\", so x is a real number. Φ is defined as the standard normal CDF. The derivative Φ’(x) is naturally the PDF. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. Φ is the standard normal CDF.\n2. Φ’(x) is the derivative of Φ(x).\n3. x is a real number.\n\nWait, but in the example, they listed two separate assumptions about n. Here, the key elements are Φ being the standard normal CDF, which implies Φ’ is the PDF. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nΦ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function,\nΦ’(x) is the standard normal probability density function,\nx is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that xΦ(x) + Φ’(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ ℝ.\n\nBut the original problem's title is already stating the problem. So I need to structure it as per the format. The user provided their approach, but that's part of the question, not the assumptions. The assumptions should be the given conditions of the problem. The fact that Φ is the standard normal CDF is an assumption. The problem is to prove the inequality. The other parts about the derivative and x being real are inherent in the problem statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the original problem, it was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that example might have been modified by the user. Wait, looking back, the original example's formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. So perhaps the user added an extra assumption there. But in this case, the problem doesn't have any hidden assumptions. The user just needs to list the given conditions.\n\nWait, maybe the example was structured to filter out unrelated info. The original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was part of a different problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Because if the original problem says for every integer n, then the assumption that n is an integer is already given. Adding n is divisible by 7 would restrict it. But perhaps the example was from a different problem. Maybe the user made a mistake. Anyway, in this case, the problem is to prove the inequality for all real x, with Φ being the standard normal CDF. So the assumptions should include Φ being the standard normal CDF, and x being a real number. Φ’(x) is part of the problem's definition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nΦ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function,\nx is a real number.\n\nBut Φ’(x) is the derivative of Φ(x), which is the standard normal PDF. Maybe that's inherent in the CDF's definition, so perhaps it's not necessary to list as a separate assumption. However, to be thorough, since the problem includes Φ’(x), maybe we should state that Φ’(x) is the derivative of Φ(x). Alternatively, since Φ is the standard normal CDF, its derivative is the PDF, so that's already implied. Therefore, the key assumptions are Φ is the standard normal CDF and x is real.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nΦ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function,\nx is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that xΦ(x) + Φ’(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ ℝ.\n\nBut wait, the original question's problem statement is exactly that. The user also mentioned that Φ(x) is the integral from -infty to x of (1/sqrt(2π)) e^{-y²/2} dy, which defines the standard normal CDF. So maybe we need to include the definition of Φ as part of the assumptions. Let's check the example: in the example, they included the expression for A(n), but the formatted problem listed the assumptions and then restated the problem. Here, the problem is to prove the inequality, given that Φ is the standard normal CDF. So the assumptions are Φ as defined, and x is real.\n\nSo yes, I think that's correct. Now, the problem part is exactly the inequality to prove. The rest of the user's text about their approach and the application to Bachelier's model should be filtered out, as per the instructions to \"filter the unrelated information.\"\n\nSo final answer:",
