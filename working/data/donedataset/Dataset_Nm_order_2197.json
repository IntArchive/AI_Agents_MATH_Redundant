    "Content": "It seems intuitively very clear that $e^{x}$ is not uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. I'm looking to 'prove' it using $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$ analysis though. I reason as follows: Suppose $\\epsilon > 0$; in fact, fix it to be $\\epsilon=1$. For contradiction, suppose that $\\exists \\delta >0$ s.t. $$ (\\star) \\ |x-y|<\\delta \\Rightarrow |e^{x}-e^{y}|<\\epsilon=1 \\text{  for  } x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\nNote that $e^{x+\\delta}-e^{x}=e^{x}(e^{\\delta}-1)$. So, for $x$ large enough (so that RHS $>1$), the relation $(\\star)$ does not hold. This is our contradiction, and so the exponential function is not uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. Is this reasoning correct and sufficient? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you are truly looking for a rigorous answer then you need to justify the \"So, for $x$ large enough...\". For instance, here is a very rigorous solution along the lines you suggest: Assume that $e^x$ is uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb {R}$. Let $\\epsilon = 1$. Thus there is $\\delta >0$ such that for all $x,y\\in \\mathbb R$ if $|x-y|<\\delta $ then $|e^x-e^y| < 1$. Let $a=\\delta/2$. Since $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty }e^x=\\infty$ and since $e^a-1>0$ it follows that $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty }e^x(e^a-1)=\\infty$. Consequently, there is some $x\\in \\mathbb {R}$ such that $e^x(e^a-1)>1$. However, taking $y=x+a$ we have $|x-y|<\\delta$ while $|e^x-e^y|=e^x(e^a-1)>1$, a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to know if their proof that the exponential function isn't uniformly continuous on the real numbers is correct. First, I need to recall the definition of uniform continuity. A function f is uniformly continuous on a set S if for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for all x, y in S, |x - y| < δ implies |f(x) - f(y)| < ε. \n\nThe user's approach is to fix ε = 1 and assume for contradiction that there exists a δ > 0 satisfying the condition. Then they consider the difference e^(x+δ) - e^x, which simplifies to e^x(e^δ - 1). They argue that as x becomes large, this difference exceeds 1, contradicting the assumption. \n\nI need to verify if this reasoning is valid. The key idea in uniform continuity is that δ works for all x and y in the domain. Here, by choosing x sufficiently large, even a fixed δ would lead to the difference e^x(e^δ - 1) becoming larger than ε=1. Since e^x grows without bound as x increases, for any δ > 0, e^δ - 1 is a positive constant, so the product will eventually exceed 1. That makes sense. \n\nBut wait, is there a specific point where this happens? Let's check. For a given δ, we can solve e^x > 1/(e^δ - 1). Taking natural logs, x > ln(1/(e^δ - 1)) = -ln(e^δ - 1). So for x larger than this value, the difference would indeed be greater than 1. Therefore, such x exists, which breaks the uniform continuity condition. \n\nThe user's reasoning seems correct. They've identified that the exponential function's unbounded growth rate means that no single δ can satisfy the ε condition across the entire real line. The contradiction arises because, regardless of the chosen δ, there's always an x large enough to make the function's difference exceed ε. \n\nAnother way to think about this is using the sequential criterion for uniform continuity. A function isn't uniformly continuous if there exist two sequences (x_n) and (y_n) such that |x_n - y_n| → 0 but |f(x_n) - f(y_n)| does not approach 0. For example, take x_n = n and y_n = n + δ/2. Then |x_n - y_n| = δ/2 < δ for large n, but |e^{y_n} - e^{x_n}| = e^{n}(e^{δ/2} - 1) which tends to infinity, not staying less than 1. This aligns with the user's approach.\n\nSo the user's proof is valid and sufficient. They might want to make it more formal by explicitly choosing x values based on δ, but the core idea is correct.",
