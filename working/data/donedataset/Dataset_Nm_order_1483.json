    "Content": "I want to show that the total space $E$ is compact if  the fiber $F$ and the base space $B$ are compact. Let $\\pi$ denote the fiber projection. Since every point in $B$ has an open neighborhood $U$ whose preimage $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is homeomorphic to $U\\times F$ via $\\phi_U=(\\pi,\\beta_U)$, there are finitely many such sets covering $B$. Let's call this collection $\\mathcal U$. Then $\\mathcal S:=\\{\\phi_U^{-1}(V\\times W)\\mid U\\in\\mathcal U,V\\text{ open}\\subseteq U,W\\text{ open}\\subseteq F\\}$ is a subbase for the topology on $E$. By Alexander's subbase lemma we can restrict ourselves to considering a cover $\\mathcal C\\subseteq\\mathcal S$ of $E$. (Mariano Suárez-Alvarez recommends this in his answer here ) For each $b\\in B$ the fiber $\\pi^{-1}(b)$ is compact and thus contained in the union ${\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n_b}\\phi^{-1}_{U_i^b}(V_i^b\\times W_i^b)}$ of sets in $\\mathcal C$. Define $V^b:=\\bigcap_{i=1}^{n_b}V_i^b$. By compactness $B=\\bigcup_{k=1}^l V^{b_k}$. I think that $E=\\bigcup_{k=1}^l\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n_{b_k}}\\phi^{-1}_{U_i^{b_k}}(V_i^{b_k}\\times W_i^{b_k})$, similar to the proof of compactness of the product of two compact spaces. Unlike the trivial bundle case, however, where the homeo's are just identities, here the $\\phi_{U}$'s could be pretty ugly, especially where they are overlapping, and we don't have $y\\in\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n_{b_k}}\\phi^{-1}_{U_i^{b_k}}(V_i^{b_k}\\times W_i^{b_k})\\ $   whenever   $\\ \\pi(y)\\in V^{b_k}$ So I try to get to a contradiction by assuming that for each $k=1,\\dots,m$ such that $\\pi(y)\\in V^{b_k}$ we have $\\forall i=1,\\dots,n_k:\\ y\\notin\\phi^{-1}_{U_i^{b_k}}(V_i^{b_k}\\times W_i^{b_k})$ which then implies $\\beta_{U^k_i}(y)\\notin W_i^{b_k}$. If there were a $k$ such that $U^k_1,\\dots,U^k_{n_k}$ were all the same then I would be finished. But maybe the $b_k$'s should have been chosen in certain way. Maybe someone remembers how the proof worked.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We use the following characterization of compactness: every infinite net has a convergent subnet. Let $\\{x_{\\lambda}\\}_{\\Lambda}$ be an infinite net in $E$, $\\Lambda$ the directed set of the net. As $B$ is compact, there is an infinite subnet $\\Lambda_1 \\subset \\Lambda$ for which $\\{\\pi(x_{\\lambda})\\}_{\\Lambda_1}$ converges to a point $b \\in B$. Fix a local trivialization $\\phi_U : \\pi^{-1}(U) \\rightarrow U \\times F$ for $b \\in U$. Pare off the net $\\Lambda_1$ so that $\\pi(x_{\\lambda}) \\in U$ for all $\\lambda$. Now let $\\pi_2 : U \\times F \\rightarrow F$ be the continuous projection onto the second factor. So, $\\{\\pi_2 \\circ \\phi_U(x_{\\lambda})\\}$ is an infinite net in $F$, hence possesses yet another convergent subnet $\\Lambda_2$. Then $\\{\\phi_U(x_{\\lambda})\\}_{\\Lambda_2}$ is convergent in $U \\times F$ by definition of the product topology, and the image of this convergent net under the homeomorphism $\\phi_U^{-1}$ is convergent. Thus $\\{x_{\\lambda}\\}_{\\Lambda_2}$ is a convergent subnet.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem. The user wants to show that the total space E of a fiber bundle is compact if both the base space B and the fiber F are compact. They mention using Alexander's subbase lemma, which is a good approach for dealing with subbases in topology. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that the base B and fiber F are compact. The total space E is part of a fiber bundle with projection π. Each point in B has an open neighborhood U such that the preimage π⁻¹(U) is homeomorphic to U×F via some homeomorphism φ_U. The collection of these U's forms an open cover of B, and since B is compact, there's a finite subcover, say U is in the collection 𝒰. \n\nThe user then constructs a subbasis 𝒮 for E's topology using these homeomorphisms. Alexander's lemma allows them to consider covers from this subbasis. They take a cover 𝒞 ⊆ 𝒮 and try to show it has a finite subcover. For each point b in B, the fiber π⁻¹(b) is compact, so it's covered by finitely many sets from 𝒞. They define V^b as the intersection of the projections of these sets, which should be an open neighborhood of b in B. By compactness of B, finitely many V^b_k cover B. The user then attempts to combine these to cover E but runs into issues with overlapping homeomorphisms and ensuring all points are covered. \n\nThe key assumptions here are that B and F are compact, the bundle has local trivializations, and the use of Alexander's subbase lemma. The problem is to prove E is compact under these conditions. I need to structure the assumptions one by one, making sure each is a single condition on one object. The problem statement is then to show E is compact given those assumptions.",
