    "Content": "Say I have two topological spaces given by $(X,\\mathscr{T}_X)$ and $(Y,\\mathscr{T}_Y)$ where $Y$ is Hausdorff. In addition say I have a function $f:X\\rightarrow Y$, and let it be continuous. I want to show that $Gr(f):=\\{(x,f(x))\\mid x\\in X\\}$ is a closed subset of $(X\\times Y)$. In answering this question, could you also provide the \"chain of thought\" that brought you to the solution. I am aware of what the continuity of the function and the fact that $Y$ is Hausdorff provides me in terms of definition. I am however, finding it hard to find a -link- towards answering the question. Thank you all in advance for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $G=\\operatorname{Gr}(f)$. In this case the easiest way to show that $G$ is closed in $X\\times Y$ is to show that its complement is open, so let $\\langle x,y\\rangle\\in(X\\times Y)\\setminus G$. Since $\\langle x,y\\rangle\\notin G$, $y\\ne f(x)$. Thus, $y$ and $f(x)$ are distinct points in $Y$. And $Y$ is Hausdorff, so there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ in $Y$ such that $y\\in U$ and $f(x)\\in V$. Finally, $f$ is continuous, so there is an open nbhd $W$ of $x$ such that $f[W]\\subseteq V$. Up to here I’ve just done what comes naturally: I’ve used the hypotheses in the most obvious way without really thinking about where I’m going. I’m trying to show that $\\langle x,y\\rangle$ has an open nbhd contained in $(X\\times Y)\\setminus G$; do I have an open nbhd of $\\langle x,y\\rangle$ hanging about anywhere? Yes: by definition of the product topology, $W\\times U$ is an open nbhd of $\\langle x,y\\rangle$ in $X\\times Y$. If I’m lucky, this nbhd $W\\times U$ will turn out to be disjoint from $G$, showing that $\\langle x,y\\rangle$ is not in the closure of $G$. And since $\\langle x,y\\rangle$ was an arbitrary point of $(X\\times Y)\\setminus G$, this would show that $(X\\times Y)\\setminus G$ is open and hence that $G$ is closed. Let $\\langle z,f(z)\\rangle$ be any point of $G$. If $z\\notin W$, then clearly $\\langle z,f(z)\\rangle\\notin W\\times U$. If $z\\in W$, then $f(z)\\in V$, so $f(z)\\notin U$, and therefore $\\langle z,f(z)\\rangle\\notin W\\times U$. Thus, in all cases $\\langle z,f(z)\\rangle\\notin W\\times U$, and it follows that $(W\\times U)\\cap G=\\varnothing$. Thus, each point of $(X\\times Y)\\setminus G$ has an open nbhd disjoint from $G$, and $G$ is therefore closed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to prove that the graph of a continuous function from a topological space X to a Hausdorff space Y is closed. So, first, the problem states that Y is Hausdorff and f is continuous. The goal is to show that Gr(f) = {(x, f(x)) | x ∈ X} is closed in X×Y.\n\nHmm, I remember that in topology, a set is closed if its complement is open. But sometimes it's easier to show that a set contains all its limit points. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the graph is closed if the product space X×Y has certain properties. Wait, Y being Hausdorff is important here. What does Hausdorff imply? That any two distinct points in Y have disjoint neighborhoods. Also, continuity of f means that the preimage of open sets in Y are open in X.\n\nLet me think about the complement of Gr(f) in X×Y. If I take a point (x,y) not in Gr(f), that means y ≠ f(x). Since Y is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods around y and f(x). Let's say U around y and V around f(x) such that U ∩ V = ∅. Then, maybe I can construct an open set around (x,y) that doesn't intersect Gr(f). The open set in the product topology would be a product of an open set in X and an open set in Y. Since f is continuous, the preimage of V under f, which is f⁻¹(V), is open in X. So, maybe the open neighborhood around x is f⁻¹(V), and around y is U. Then, the product f⁻¹(V) × U would be an open set in X×Y. If I take any point (x', y') in this product, then f(x') is in V because x' is in f⁻¹(V), and y' is in U. But U and V are disjoint, so y' ≠ f(x'), meaning (x', y') is not in Gr(f). Therefore, this product set is contained in the complement of Gr(f), so the complement is open, hence Gr(f) is closed.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check again. If (x,y) is not in Gr(f), then y ≠ f(x). Since Y is Hausdorff, there's U around y and V around f(x) that are disjoint. Then, because f is continuous, f⁻¹(V) is open in X. So, the set f⁻¹(V) × U is open in X×Y and contains (x,y). Any point in this set would have their first component in f⁻¹(V), so f(x') ∈ V, and the second component in U. Since U and V are disjoint, f(x') ≠ y', so (x', y') isn't in Gr(f). Therefore, every point not in Gr(f) has an open neighborhood disjoint from Gr(f), so Gr(f) is closed.\n\nAlternatively, another approach might be to show that the graph is the preimage of a closed set under some continuous function. For example, consider the function g: X×Y → Y×Y defined by g(x,y) = (f(x), y). Then, the diagonal Δ = {(y,y) | y ∈ Y} is closed in Y×Y because Y is Hausdorff. The graph Gr(f) is the preimage of Δ under g, right? Because g⁻¹(Δ) would be all (x,y) such that f(x) = y, which is exactly Gr(f). Since g is continuous (because f is continuous and the identity on Y is continuous), and Δ is closed, then Gr(f) = g⁻¹(Δ) is closed in X×Y. That seems like a cleaner argument.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the key steps are: using the continuity of f to make g continuous, using that Y is Hausdorff to ensure the diagonal is closed, and then Gr(f) being the preimage of a closed set under a continuous function is therefore closed.",
