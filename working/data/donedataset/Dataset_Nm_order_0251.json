    "Content": "I recently noticed that this really weird equation actually carries a closed form! $$\\int_0^1 \\left(\\frac{x^x}{(1-x)^{1-x}}-\\frac{(1-x)^{1-x}}{x^x}\\right)\\text{d}x=0$$ I honestly do not know how to prove this amazing result! I do not know nearly enough about the sophomore's dream integral properties to answer this question, which I have been trying to apply here. (If possible, please stay with real methods, as I do not know contour integration yet)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is important to note some symmetry: Consider: $$I=\\int_0^1 \\frac{x^x}{(1-x)^{1-x}}\\text{d}x$$ If you substitute $x\\to 1-x, \\text{d}x\\to -\\text{d}x$ You are left with: $$I=-\\int_{1-0}^{1-1}\\frac{(1-x)^{(1-x)}}{(1-(1-x))^{(1-(1-x))}}\\text{d}x=\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^{1-x}}{x^x}\\text{d}x$$ And your integral is only $I-I=0$, your result. You didn't even need to know $x^x$ properties! In fact, this can be further generalized: $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{f(x)}{f(1-x)}\\text{d}x=\\int_0^1 \\frac{f(1-x)}{f(x)}\\text{d}x$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the required format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and the problem. So first, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that a specific integral equals zero. The integral given is from 0 to 1 of [x^x/(1-x)^{1-x} - (1-x)^{1-x}/x^x] dx. The user mentions they don't know much about the sophomore's dream and prefers real methods over contour integration.\n\nNow, the task is to list all assumptions and then state the problem. Let's see. The integral is from 0 to 1, so the limits are fixed. The integrand involves x^x and (1-x)^{1-x}. The functions x^x and (1-x)^{1-x} are defined for x in (0,1), but at the endpoints, x=0 and x=1, there might be singularities. However, the integral is likely convergent since the user is asking about its value. The problem is to prove the integral equals zero. \n\nWhat assumptions can we list here? The integral is over the interval [0,1]. The integrand is composed of x^x and (1-x)^{1-x}. Each part of the integrand is defined for x in (0,1). But the problem doesn't mention any specific conditions on x beyond being in the interval. However, perhaps there's an implicit assumption about the convergence of the integral. Also, the problem mentions using real methods, so maybe that's an assumption? Wait, the user requested to stay with real methods if possible, but that's more of a constraint on the solution method rather than an assumption of the problem itself.\n\nLooking back at the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable (n being an integer, n divisible by 7). In this integral problem, the variables are x from 0 to 1, and the functions involved. So possible assumptions:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [0,1].\n- The functions x^x and (1-x)^{1-x} are defined for x in (0,1).\n- The integral converges.\n\nBut the problem statement itself already includes the integral from 0 to 1, so maybe the interval is part of the problem, not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. The original problem's formatted version included those as assumptions. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be about the functions involved and their properties?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a substitution or symmetry involved. Let me think. The integrand is [x^x/(1-x)^{1-x} - (1-x)^{1-x}/x^x]. If we substitute x with 1 - x, let's see what happens. Let u = 1 - x. Then when x=0, u=1, x=1, u=0. The integral becomes from 1 to 0 of [( (1-u)^{1-u} / u^u ) - (u^u / (1-u)^{1-u}) ] (-du). Which is the same as integrating from 0 to 1 [ (1-u)^{1-u}/u^u - u^u/(1-u)^{1-u} ] du. That's the negative of the original integrand. So maybe this symmetry implies that the integral is equal to its negative, hence zero. But the problem is to prove this, so perhaps the key assumption is that the substitution x → 1-x transforms the integrand into its negative. However, this is more of a step in the solution rather than an assumption.\n\nWait, the user is supposed to list assumptions that are given in the problem. Since the problem is just to compute the integral, maybe the assumptions are about the functions being integrable over [0,1], and the interval of integration. But the example given in the prompt had specific assumptions about n. Here, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral being from 0 to 1 and the integrand being as given. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0,1].\n- The functions x^x and (1−x)^{1−x} are considered in the integrand.\n\nBut maybe more precisely:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0,1].\nThe integrand is composed of x^x/(1−x)^{1−x} and (1−x)^{1−x}/x^x.\nThe integral converges.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were specific to the variable. Here, the integral's convergence might be an implicit assumption. However, in the example, the user added an assumption about n being divisible by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake? Because if n is divisible by 7, then the problem would be easier. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the user in the example made a mistake in formatting. But maybe the example was for a different problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then there shouldn't be an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Unless perhaps there was a miscommunication. Anyway, maybe the example is not perfect.\n\nBut back to the current problem. The integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is [x^x/(1-x)^{1-x} - (1-x)^{1-x}/x^x] dx. The user wants to prove this equals zero. The key here is the symmetry when substituting x with 1 - x, which flips the integrand. So maybe the integral from 0 to1 of f(x) dx = integral from 0 to1 of -f(1-x) dx, and thus the integral is zero. But to make that rigorous, you need to make sure the substitution is valid, and the integral converges.\n\nBut as assumptions, perhaps:\n\n- The function f(x) = x^x/(1−x)^{1−x} - (1−x)^{1−x}/x^x is integrable over [0,1].\n- The substitution x → 1−x is valid for the integral.\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't mention these; they are part of the solution. The problem is to prove the integral equals zero. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\nThe integrand is defined as $$\\frac{x^x}{(1-x)^{1-x}} - \\frac{(1-x)^{1-x}}{x^x}$$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^1 \\left( \\frac{x^x}{(1-x)^{1-x}} - \\frac{(1-x)^{1-x}}{x^x} \\right) dx = 0.$$\n\nBut the example had assumptions about the variable (n being integer, etc.). Here, the integral is over x from 0 to1. Maybe the assumption is that x is a real variable in (0,1). But perhaps that's implicit. Alternatively, maybe there's no need for assumptions beyond what's in the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", but that seems incorrect. Perhaps the example was for a different problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Regardless, following the user's instruction, they want to filter unrelated info and structure the problem with assumptions and problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to1, and the integrand is given. The problem is to prove it equals zero. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is composed of the difference between x^x/(1-x)^{1-x} and (1-x)^{1-x}/x^x.\n- The functions involved are integrable over [0,1].\n\nBut the original problem didn't state any assumptions explicitly, so maybe the user just needs to list the integral's limits and the definition of the integrant as assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand is the difference between $\\frac{x^x}{(1-x)^{1-x}}$ and $\\frac{(1-x)^{1-x}}{x^x}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals zero.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about the variables, but here, it's about the integral's properties. So perhaps the correct way is to list the interval and the integrand's form as assumptions.",
