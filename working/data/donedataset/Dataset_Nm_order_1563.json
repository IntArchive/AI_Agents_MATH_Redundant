    "Content": "I am working on getting the hang of proofs by induction, and I was hoping the community could give me feedback on how to format a proof of this nature: Let $x > -1$ and $n$ be a positive integer. Prove Bernoulli's inequality:\n$$ (1+x)^n \\ge 1+nx$$ Proof : Base Case: For $n=1$, $1+x = 1+x$ so the inequality holds. Induction Assumption: Assume that for some integer $k\\ge1$, $(1+x)^k \\ge 1+kx$. Inductive Step: We must show that $(1+x)^{k+1} \\ge 1+(k+1)x$ Proof of Inductive Step : \n$$\\begin{align*}\n(1+x)^k &\\ge 1+kx \\\\\n(1+x)(1+x)^k &\\ge (1+x)(1+kx)\\\\\n(1+x)^{k+1} &\\ge  1 + (k+1)x + kx^2 \\\\\n 1 + (k+1)x + kx^2 &> 1+(k+1)x \\quad (kx^2 >0) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow (1+x)^{k+1} &\\ge 1 + (k+1)x \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\square\n\\end{align*}$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "What you have is perfectly acceptable. The calculations could be organized a little more neatly: $$\\begin{align*}\n(1+x)^{k+1}&=(1+x)(1+x)^k\\\\\n&\\ge(1+x)(1+kx)\\\\\n&=1+(k+1)x+kx^2\\\\\n&\\ge1+(k+1)x\\;,\n\\end{align*}$$ since $kx^2\\ge 0$. This completes the induction step.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they provided includes an assumption section where each line is a single condition or property applied to one object, then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the given Math Stack Exchange question about Bernoulli's inequality. The original problem is to prove that (1+x)^n ≥ 1 + nx for x > -1 and n a positive integer. The user included a proof by induction with base case, induction assumption, and inductive step.\n\nSo, the task here is to extract the assumptions and the problem from the original question. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The problem statement is the inequality itself.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the conditions are x > -1 and n is a positive integer. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumption section. The problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"Let x > -1 and n be a positive integer.\" So, two separate assumptions: one about x and one about n. Each on their own line. Then the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The induction proof is part of the solution, but the problem statement itself only gives those two conditions. So the assumptions are x > -1 and n is a positive integer. Each in their own line. Then the problem is to prove (1+x)^n ≥ 1 + nx.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as given. The user's example had two assumptions as well, each on separate lines, so this follows the same structure.",
