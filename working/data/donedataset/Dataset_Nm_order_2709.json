    "Content": "Consider the regular tiling $(m,n)$ in which $m$ $n$-agons meet at each vertex. Most of the time this tilings have to \"live\" in the hyperbolic plane. The edges of its polygons define a graph where two vertices are adjacent if they share an edge of a polygon. I would like to prove that most of these graphs have the infinite binary tree as a subgraph. Of course, it would be impossible to show this for the regular tiling $(4,4)$ because the amount of vertices at a given distance from a given vertex grows quadratically, not exponentially like in the binary tree. However, for most $(m,n)$ this growth is exponential and so the infinite binary tree could fit.  By staring at images of these tilings this seems completely plausible, but I am having troubles formalizing it. I have been able to prove that this indeed happens in $(4,5)$. I tried to use Cayley graph's arguments but got lost. So basically I have the following questions: How can I know if the graph I described for $(m,n)$ is the Cayley graph of a group? And if so, is it the Cayley graph of a well-known group? Is my Cayley argument too complicated and there is a simpler proof? Do you have any tips for drawing the $(m,n)$ tiling? Can you help me with this proof or point me to some theory that may help? Thanks in advance! : )",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm not sure of this and I don't have a formal proof, but I think the answer should be that this is impossible iff $m\\le3$ or $m=n=4$. For $m\\le3$, look at this image . (Note that their ${p,q}$ is reversed with respect to your $(m,n)$.) If you put the root at some vertex (say, the one in the centre), all choices for the two first branches are equivalent. From then on, there are no choices left, and you're forced to go around one of the $n$-gons until two leaves coincide. This will be the case whenever $m=3$. Obviously the situation is even worse for $m=2$. For $m=n=4$, you already pointed out why it's impossible. So it remains to be shown that it's possible if $m>4$ or $n>4$. For $m>4$, look at this image . Starting at the vertex in the centre, choose two adjacent edges, and then always choose the middle two vertices of the four options. It seems clear from the image that these branches can't collide, and I think it shouldn't be too difficult to prove it formally by adding up the angles or something like that. Things can only get better if you increase $m$ further, since that will just generate more branchings in between the chosen ones, and increasing $n$ will squash things into a smaller angle range but shouldn't reduce the options for the branches. (I'm aware some of this is quite handwaving, but it feels right and could point the way towards a formal proof.) For $n>4$, look at this image . (This is the one that you've already proved possible.) Starting at the vertex in the centre, choose any two adjacent edges. When you reach a vertex, always choose the edge that continues straight and the one that makes a turn towards the sibling branch. (Imagine a street sign \"Right branch turns left\". :-) Here, too, it seems clear that these branches won't meet, and that increasing $n$ or $m$ can't close off this option.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and format it according to the user's specifications. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original question is about embedding the infinite binary tree in regular tilings (m,n). The user mentions that in these tilings, m n-agons meet at each vertex. They note that most of these tilings exist in the hyperbolic plane and that the edges form a graph. The goal is to prove that most of these graphs contain the infinite binary tree as a subgraph. They also mention some specific attempts, like the (4,5) tiling, and have questions about Cayley graphs and other methods.\n\nSo, the main problem here is to prove that the graph defined by the (m,n) tiling contains the infinite binary tree as a subgraph. The assumptions need to be extracted. Let's see:\n\n1. The tiling is regular, denoted by (m,n), meaning m n-agons meet at each vertex.\n2. The tiling exists in the hyperbolic plane (since they mention that most of the time it's hyperbolic, but maybe this is a consequence of m and n rather than an assumption? The user says \"Most of the time this tilings have to 'live' in the hyperbolic plane,\" so perhaps the assumption is just that we're considering regular tilings (m,n) without specifying the geometry, but the fact that they are usually hyperbolic is a property, not an assumption. However, the problem might implicitly assume that the tiling is such that the graph has exponential growth, unlike (4,4) which has quadratic growth. Wait, the original problem says \"most of these graphs have the infinite binary tree as a subgraph,\" so the assumption is about the tiling (m,n) where the growth is exponential. But the user is trying to prove that for \"most\" (m,n) tilings, the graph contains the infinite binary tree. However, in the example given by the user, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's assumptions. But here, in the problem presented, the original problem doesn't state explicit assumptions like \"m and n satisfy 1/m + 1/n < 1/2\" (which is the condition for hyperbolic tilings). However, the user mentions that \"most of the time this tilings have to 'live' in the hyperbolic plane,\" but maybe that's a property rather than an assumption. The problem is to prove that for most (m,n) tilings, the graph contains the infinite binary tree. The user's example includes an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the assumptions would relate to the tiling parameters m and n such that the graph has exponential growth. But the user's problem as stated doesn't specify particular m and n, except to exclude (4,4). However, the user's original problem says \"for most (m,n)\", so maybe the assumption is that the tiling (m,n) is such that the graph has exponential growth (which would correspond to hyperbolic tilings). So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The tiling is a regular (m,n) tiling where m n-agons meet at each vertex.\n- The growth of the graph (number of vertices at distance k from a given vertex) is exponential.\n\nBut how to phrase that? The original problem says \"most of these graphs have the infinite binary tree as a subgraph. Of course, it would be impossible to show this for the regular tiling (4,4) because the amount of vertices at a given distance from a given vertex grows quadratically, not exponentially like in the binary tree. However, for most (m,n) this growth is exponential...\" So the problem is under the assumption that the tiling (m,n) has exponential growth. But the user is trying to prove that under such conditions, the graph contains the infinite binary tree. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Consider a regular tiling (m,n) where m n-agons meet at each vertex.\n2. The growth rate of the graph (number of vertices at distance k from a given vertex) is exponential.\n\nBut maybe the exponential growth is a consequence of the tiling being hyperbolic, so perhaps another way is to assume that the tiling is hyperbolic. The regular tilings (m,n) are hyperbolic when 1/m + 1/n < 1/2. So perhaps the assumption is that the tiling is hyperbolic, i.e., 1/m + 1/n < 1/2. But the original question doesn't state that explicitly as an assumption; the user just mentions that most tilings are hyperbolic. However, in the problem statement, the user wants to prove that \"most of these graphs\" have the infinite binary tree as a subgraph. The example given in the original problem (the user's example) included specific assumptions (n is an integer, n divisible by 7). Here, perhaps the assumption is that the tiling is regular (m,n) with m and n such that the growth is exponential (i.e., hyperbolic). But how to state that concisely?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more general, and the assumption is simply that the tiling is regular (m,n), and the problem is to prove that under the condition that the tiling's graph has exponential growth, the infinite binary tree is a subgraph. However, in the original problem, the user is trying to prove that for \"most\" (m,n) tilings (excluding cases like (4,4)), the graph contains the binary tree. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. The tiling is a regular (m,n) tiling where m n-agons meet at each vertex.\n2. The growth rate of the graph's vertices is exponential (i.e., not polynomial like in (4,4)).\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, the assumption is that the tiling is not Euclidean, i.e., it's hyperbolic. Because Euclidean tilings (like (4,4), (3,6), etc.) have polynomial growth, while hyperbolic tilings have exponential growth. So maybe the assumption is that the tiling (m,n) is hyperbolic, which happens when 1/m + 1/n < 1/2. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly state this, but the user implies it by referring to \"most\" tilings being hyperbolic. However, in the example given by the user, they included specific conditions (n is an integer, n divisible by 7). Here, maybe the assumption is that the tiling (m,n) is hyperbolic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is general and the assumptions are just the regular tiling (m,n) without specifying, but the user wants to know under what conditions (which would be part of the problem). Hmm, the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's setup, but in this case, the original problem doesn't specify particular m and n, but rather says \"most of these\". Therefore, perhaps the key assumption here is that the tiling (m,n) is such that the graph has exponential growth, i.e., it's a hyperbolic tiling, but the problem is to prove that under such conditions, the graph contains the infinite binary tree as a subgraph. Alternatively, the problem could be stated as: Given a regular (m,n) tiling with exponential growth, prove that its graph contains the infinite binary tree as a subgraph. The user also mentions that they were able to prove it for (4,5). So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. The tiling is a regular (m,n) tiling where m n-agons meet at each vertex.\n2. The tiling's graph has exponential growth.\n\nBut how to phrase assumption 2 concisely? Alternatively, since the problem is about \"most\" tilings, perhaps the assumption is that the tiling is not Euclidean (i.e., not (4,4), (3,6), etc.), but that's not a positive condition. Alternatively, the problem could be phrased without assumptions and the problem is to determine for which (m,n) the graph contains the infinite binary tree. But according to the user's example, assumptions are listed as specific conditions. So maybe the problem as the user wants it formatted would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The tiling is regular (m,n), where m n-agons meet at each vertex.\n- The tiling's graph has exponential growth.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the graph defined by the regular tiling (m,n) contains the infinite binary tree as a subgraph.\n\nBut the original question also mentions that the user tried Cayley graph arguments and asks about that. But the main problem is to prove the embedding. The other questions (Cayley graph, drawing tips) are separate, but according to the user's instruction, we need to structure the problem part as the main question. The user's example included only the main problem, even though the original question had multiple parts. Wait, in the example, the original question was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe here, the main problem is the one the user is focusing on, which is proving that the graph contains the infinite binary tree as a subgraph for most (m,n) tilings. The other questions (Cayley graph, drawing tips) are additional but perhaps not part of the formatted problem. The user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\", so maybe we need to focus on the main problem part. So the assumptions would be the regular tiling (m,n) with exponential growth. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe tiling is a regular (m,n) tiling where m n-agons meet at each vertex,\nThe growth of the graph's vertices is exponential.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the graph defined by the regular tiling (m,n) contains the infinite binary tree as a subgraph.\n\nAlternatively, since the user mentions that in (4,4) it's impossible, but for most others it's possible, so perhaps the assumption is that the tiling is not (4,4), but that's too specific. Alternatively, the assumption is that the tiling is hyperbolic. But how does the user phrase that? The user's original problem says \"most of these tilings have to 'live' in the hyperbolic plane\", so perhaps the assumption is that the tiling is hyperbolic. But the exact condition for a regular tiling to be hyperbolic is 1/m + 1/n < 1/2. But the problem doesn't state that as an assumption. The user is asking to prove for \"most\" (m,n) tilings. So perhaps the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe tiling is a regular (m,n) tiling where m n-agons meet at each vertex,\nThe tiling is hyperbolic (i.e., 1/m + 1/n < 1/2).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the graph defined by the tiling contains the infinite binary tree as a subgraph.\n\nBut the user didn't explicitly state the hyperbolic condition, but inferred it. Alternatively, since the user mentions that \"most of the time this tilings have to 'live' in the hyperbolic plane\", perhaps the assumption is just that it's a regular tiling (m,n), and the problem is to prove that under this condition (which usually implies hyperbolic), the graph contains the infinite binary tree. But the example given by the user included specific assumptions from the problem (n is integer, divisible by 7). Here, the original problem doesn't specify particular m and n, but the user is trying to prove it for \"most\" tilings, which are hyperbolic. So perhaps the key assumption is that the tiling is regular (m,n) with m and n such that the tiling is hyperbolic (1/m + 1/n < 1/2). Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe tiling is a regular (m,n) tiling where m n-agons meet at each vertex,\nThe tiling is hyperbolic (i.e., $\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n} < \\frac{1}{2}$).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the graph defined by the tiling contains the infinite binary tree as a subgraph.\n\nThis seems to capture the necessary conditions. The user's example included mathematical notation in the assumption, so here we can use the hyperbolic condition formula. The user might have intended that the tiling is hyperbolic, which is the case when 1/m +1/n <1/2. Therefore, these two assumptions: regular tiling (m,n), and hyperbolic condition. Then the problem is to prove the existence of the infinite binary tree as a subgraph.",
