    "Content": "I have made the following assertion a few times in this space without ever having provided a proof: Let $m$ be the smallest number such that a function $f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ has a discontinuity in its $m$th derivative.  (That is, the $(m-1)$th and lower derivatives of $f$ are continuous.)  Then $\\hat{f}(k) \\sim A k^{-(m+1)}$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$, where $$\\hat{f}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\: f(x) e^{i k x}$$ is the Fourier transform of $f$, and $A$ is a constant. I have looked for a proof of this statement without success.  Does anyone know of such a proof, or if it is not true, a counterexample?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proposition. Suppose that $f$ is $(m-1)$ times continuously differentiable, and let $g=f^{(m-1)}$. Suppose that $g$ tends to $0$ at infinity, and there exists a finite nonempty set $D$ such that $g'$ exists on $\\mathbb R\\setminus D$ There exists $h\\in L^1(\\mathbb R)$ such that $g'(x)-\\int_{-\\infty}^xh(t)\\,dt$ is constant on each connected component of $\\mathbb R\\setminus D$. Then $|\\xi|^{m+1}|\\hat f(\\xi)|$ is bounded as $\\xi\\to\\infty$, but does not tend to zero. Proof . Since $|\\hat f(\\xi)|$ is equal to $|\\xi|^{m-1}|\\hat g(\\xi)|$ up to some constant factor, it suffices to work with $ |\\xi|^{2}|\\hat g(\\xi)|$. Split the integral defining $\\hat g$ into integrals over connected components of $\\mathbb R\\setminus D$, denoted $(a_k,a_{k+1})$ below, $-\\infty=a_0<\\dots<a_n=+\\infty$. And integrate by parts:\n$$\n\\hat g(\\xi)=\\sum_k \\int_{a_k}^{a_{k+1}} e^{-i\\xi x} g(x)\\,dx = \n\\frac{1}{i\\xi}\\sum_k \\int_{a_k}^{a_{k+1}} e^{-i\\xi x} g'(x)\\,dx\n\\tag1 $$\nNo boundary terms appear because $g$ is continuous and vanishes at infinity. But they do appear when we integrate again, turning (1) into \n$$\n\\frac{-1}{\\xi^2}\\sum_k \\int_{a_k}^{a_{k+1}} e^{-i\\xi x} h(x)\\,dx -\\frac{1}{\\xi^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} e^{-i\\xi a_k} (g'(a_k-)-g'(a_k+))\n\\tag2 $$\nBy the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, the first integral in (2) tends to zero as $\\xi\\to\\infty$. Therefore, \n$|\\xi|^2|\\hat g(\\xi)|=o(1)+|P(\\xi)|$, where $P$ is a nonzero trigonometric polynomial. $\\Box$ Remarks In the special case when $D$ consists of one point, $|P|$  is constant and therefore $|\\xi|^{m+1}|\\hat f(\\xi)|$ has a finite nonzero limit at infinity. Condition 2 can be expressed by saying that $g'$ is absolutely continuous on $\\mathbb R\\setminus D$  with integrable derivative.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants me to structure it according to the specified format. First, I need to understand the original question and extract the relevant assumptions and problem statement.\n\nThe title is \"Relation between function discontinuities and Fourier transform at infinity.\" The user is talking about a function f in L²(ℝ) with a discontinuity in its mth derivative, where the (m-1)th and lower derivatives are continuous. The assertion is that the Fourier transform of f, denoted by ĝ(k), behaves like A k^{-(m+1)} as k approaches infinity. They're asking for a proof or a counterexample.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The function f is in L²(ℝ). That's one assumption.\n2. The function f has a discontinuity in its mth derivative. So, the mth derivative is discontinuous.\n3. The (m-1)th and lower derivatives of f are continuous. So, continuity up to (m-1)th derivative.\n4. The Fourier transform is defined as ĝ(k) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(x) e^{ikx} dx. That's the standard Fourier transform assumption.\n5. The problem is about the asymptotic behavior of ĝ(k) as k approaches infinity, specifically whether it's proportional to k^{-(m+1)} with some constant A.\n\nWait, the original assertion says \"the smallest number m such that f has a discontinuity in its mth derivative.\" So m is the minimal integer where this discontinuity occurs. That's another assumption: m is the smallest such integer.\n\nPutting this all together, the assumptions should be:\n\n- f ∈ L²(ℝ).\n- m is the smallest integer such that f has a discontinuity in its mth derivative.\n- The (m−1)th derivative of f is continuous.\n- The mth derivative of f is discontinuous.\n- ĝ(k) is the Fourier transform of f, defined as the integral given.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"the (m-1)th and lower derivatives are continuous,\" so maybe we need to break that down into each derivative up to m-1 being continuous. However, the user's example structured the problem with each assumption on one line, each addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a function in L²(ℝ).\n- There exists an integer m such that the mth derivative of f has a discontinuity.\n- For all integers k < m, the kth derivative of f is continuous.\n- m is the smallest integer with the above properties.\n- The Fourier transform of f is given by ĝ(k) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx.\n\nBut the user's example only listed each assumption line by line, each applying to one object. For instance, in the example, two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate line.\n\nSo applying that here:\n\nAssumption:\nf is in L²(ℝ),\nm is the smallest integer such that the mth derivative of f has a discontinuity,\nfor each integer k ≤ m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous,\nĝ(k) is the Fourier transform of f defined as ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is asserting the asymptotic behavior of ĝ(k) as k→infty. So the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, ĝ(k) ∼ A k^{-(m+1)} as k→infty, where A is a constant.\n\nWait, but in the original assertion, the user wrote \"Let m be the smallest number...\" So m is defined as that minimal integer where the mth derivative is discontinuous. Then the problem is to show that the Fourier transform decays like k^{-(m+1)}. So the problem statement would be: Prove that under these assumptions, ĝ(k) ∼ A k^{-(m+1)} as k→infty, with A a constant.\n\nNow, checking the example given: The original problem had A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n), and the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the key is that assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the actual question.\n\nSo in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f ∈ L²(ℝ).\n2. m is the smallest integer such that f has a discontinuity in its mth derivative.\n3. The (m−1)th derivative of f is continuous.\n4. The Fourier transform ĝ(k) is defined as ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx.\n\nBut wait, the (m−1)th and lower derivatives are continuous. So perhaps each derivative from 0 up to m−1 is continuous. But the example structure says each assumption should address one property of one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf is in L²(ℝ),\nThe mth derivative of f has a discontinuity,\nFor each integer k with 0 ≤ k ≤ m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous,\nm is the smallest integer for which the mth derivative of f is discontinuous,\nĝ(k) is the Fourier transform of f defined as ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx.\n\nBut maybe we can simplify \"for each integer k with 0 ≤ k ≤ m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous\" as a single line? The example had two separate lines for n being integer and n divisible by 7. So here, the continuity of derivatives up to m−1 might be considered a single assumption, but according to the user's example, each assumption is one line. However, in the example, each assumption addressed one property. So perhaps each derivative's continuity is a separate assumption? But that would be too many if m is large. Alternatively, maybe the original problem states that the function has a discontinuity in the mth derivative, but all lower derivatives are continuous. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf ∈ L²(ℝ),\nThe function f has a discontinuity in its mth derivative,\nThe (m−1)th derivative of f is continuous,\nm is the smallest integer such that the mth derivative of f is discontinuous,\nĝ(k) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the (m-1)th and lower derivatives of f are continuous,\" so perhaps the first derivative is continuous, the second up to m−1. But how to state that concisely? The user's example used separate lines for each assumption. But here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function in L²(ℝ),\nThe mth derivative of f has a discontinuity,\nFor all integers k with 0 ≤ k ≤ m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous,\nm is the smallest such integer,\nĝ(k) is the Fourier transform of f as defined.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption was one line. The user's example had two lines for n: one being integer, one being divisible by 7. Here, the continuity of all lower derivatives is one assumption. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf ∈ L²(ℝ),\nThere exists an integer m such that the mth derivative of f has a discontinuity,\nFor each integer k from 0 to m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous,\nm is the minimal integer for which the mth derivative of f is discontinuous,\nĝ(k) is defined as the integral of f(x) e^{ikx} over ℝ.\n\nSo each bullet point is an assumption. Then the problem is to prove that ĝ(k) ~ A k^{-(m+1)} as k→infty.\n\nI think that's the correct way. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an element of L²(ℝ),\nm is the smallest integer such that the mth derivative of f has a discontinuity,\nFor all integers k with 0 ≤ k ≤ m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous,\nĝ(k) is the Fourier transform of f, defined by ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ĝ(k) ∼ A k^{-(m+1)} as k → ∞, where A is a constant.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user's own words were: \"Let m be the smallest number such that a function f ∈ L²(ℝ) has a discontinuity in its mth derivative. (That is, the (m-1)th and lower derivatives of f are continuous.) Then ĝ(k) ∼ A k^{-(m+1)} as k → ∞.\" So the problem is to prove that under these conditions, the Fourier transform decays like k^{-(m+1)}.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nf ∈ L²(ℝ),\nm is the smallest integer such that the mth derivative of f has a discontinuity,\nThe (m−1)th derivative of f is continuous,\nĝ(k) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx.\n\nWait, but the original assertion says that all lower derivatives up to m−1 are continuous. So maybe the assumption is that all derivatives up to order m−1 are continuous, and the mth has a discontinuity, and m is the smallest such. So each of these can be separate assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nf ∈ L²(ℝ),\nThe mth derivative of f has a discontinuity,\nFor each integer k with 0 ≤ k ≤ m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous,\nm is the smallest integer such that the mth derivative of f is discontinuous,\nĝ(k) is the Fourier transform of f defined by ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ĝ(k) ∼ A k^{-(m+1)} as k → ∞, where A is a constant.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. For example, \"n is an integer,\" \"n is divisible by 7.\" Each line is a separate assumption. So here, each bullet point should be one line. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a function in L²(ℝ).\n- m is the smallest integer such that the mth derivative of f has a discontinuity.\n- For each integer k with 0 ≤ k ≤ m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous.\n- The Fourier transform of f is given by ĝ(k) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx.\n\nBut does the Fourier transform's definition need to be an assumption, or is it part of the problem statement? In the example, the problem statement included the definition of A(n). So maybe in this case, the definition of ĝ(k) is part of the problem statement. However, the original problem says \"where ĝ(k) = ... is the Fourier transform of f.\" So perhaps the definition of ĝ(k) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f ∈ L²(ℝ).\n- m is the smallest integer such that the mth derivative of f has a discontinuity.\n- For each integer k with 0 ≤ k ≤ m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous.\n\nThen the problem statement is:\n\nProve that the Fourier transform ĝ(k) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx satisfies ĝ(k) ∼ A k^{-(m+1)} as k → ∞, where A is a constant.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's assertion is stated as a conclusion given those conditions. So the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, the Fourier transform behaves as stated. Hence, the problem part would be: Prove that ĝ(k) ∼ A k^{-(m+1)} as k → ∞, where A is a constant.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions as above, and the problem as the statement about the asymptotic behavior.\n\nDouble-checking the example: The original problem had the function A(n) defined in the problem statement, even though the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the Fourier transform definition might be part of the problem statement. Thus, the problem would include the definition of ĝ(k).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function in L²(ℝ),\nm is the smallest integer such that the mth derivative of f has a discontinuity,\nFor each integer k with 0 ≤ k ≤ m−1, the kth derivative of f is continuous.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Fourier transform of f, defined as ĝ(k) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x) e^{ikx} dx, satisfies ĝ(k) ∼ A k^{-(m+1)} as k → ∞, where A is a constant.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property. The problem includes the definition of the Fourier transform and the statement to prove.",
