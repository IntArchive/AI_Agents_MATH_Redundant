    "Content": "How can I prove that $ 10200300040000100004000300201$ is not a perfect square ? This number is divisible with $3$ only one time. Is it a good reason and it is enough ? thanks :)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes. Assume by contradiction that your number is a perfect square $n^2$. Since $3|n \\cdot n$ and $3$ is prime, it follows that $3|n$. Then $n=3k$ and hence\n$n^2=9k^2$. Thus, your number is divisible by $9$, contradiction.",

Since the number is divisible by $3$ (sum of digits = $21$, which is divisible by $3$) but not by $9$ (sum of digits not divisible by $9$), the exponent of $3$ in its prime factorization is $1$ (odd). Hence, the number cannot be a perfect square.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to prove that the number 10200300040000100004000300201 is not a perfect square. The user mentioned that it's divisible by 3 only once, and they're wondering if that's sufficient. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of perfect squares related to prime factors. If a number is a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. So if the number is divisible by a prime like 3, the exponent of 3 in its factorization must be even. The user says it's divisible by 3 only once, meaning the exponent of 3 is 1, which is odd. That would indeed imply it's not a perfect square. But wait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nSuppose the number is divisible by 3 once. Then in its prime factorization, 3^1 is a factor. Since 1 is odd, the number can't be a perfect square. So yes, if that's true, that's a valid reason. But I need to confirm that the number is actually divisible by 3 exactly once. Let me check the divisibility by 3.\n\nTo check if a number is divisible by 3, we sum its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. Let's compute the sum of the digits of 10200300040000100004000300201.\n\nBreaking down the number: 1,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,1.\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1 (total=1)\n\n+0 =1\n\n+2=3\n\n+0=3\n\n+0=3\n\n+3=6\n\n+0=6\n\n+0=6\n\n+0=6\n\n+4=10\n\n+0=10\n\n+0=10\n\n+0=10\n\n+0=10\n\n+1=11\n\n+0=11\n\n+0=11\n\n+0=11\n\n+0=11\n\n+4=15\n\n+0=15\n\n+0=15\n\n+0=15\n\n+3=18\n\n+0=18\n\n+0=18\n\n+2=20\n\n+0=20\n\n+1=21.\n\nThe sum is 21, which is divisible by 3. So the number is divisible by 3. Now, we need to check if it's divisible by 9 (3^2). If the sum of digits is divisible by 9, then the number is divisible by 9. 21 is not divisible by 9 (since 9*2=18, 9*3=27). So the sum is 21, which is divisible by 3 but not by 9. Therefore, the number is divisible by 3 exactly once. Hence, the exponent of 3 in its prime factorization is 1, which is odd. Therefore, the number cannot be a perfect square. So the user's reasoning is correct, and that is sufficient to conclude the number isn't a perfect square.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there's no other approach needed. Maybe checking modulo 4 or something else? For example, sometimes numbers can be excluded as squares by looking at their last digits or other moduli. Let me check the last digit of the given number. The last digit is 1. Perfect squares can end with 1, so that doesn't help. What about modulo 4? The number modulo 4 is determined by its last two digits. The last two digits are 01. 01 modulo 4 is 1. Perfect squares are congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4, so that's okay. So modulo 4 doesn't rule it out. Modulo 3: the number is divisible by 3, so it's 0 mod 3. A square divisible by 3 must be divisible by 9, but since it's not divisible by 9, that's the key point. So yes, the fact that it's divisible by 3 once is enough. So the user is correct. Therefore, the problem can be structured as per their assumption.",
