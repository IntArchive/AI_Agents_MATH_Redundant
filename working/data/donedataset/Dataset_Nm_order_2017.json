    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you put $t=0$, the sum of the $\\mu_i$ is zero, so at least one of them is negative (unless they are all zero). Intuitively, assume $a_n$ is greater than all of the other $a$'s.  Then if $t$ gets very large, that term will dominate over all the others, so $\\mu_n$ must be zero.  Then argue the same about the next largest.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that the set of functions {e^{a_i t}} is linearly independent in the space of continuous functions from R to R, given that the a_i are distinct real numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that {a_i} from i=0 to n are in R and are distinct. The functions in question are e^{a_i t}, which are in C^0(R, R). So the assumptions should cover these points: the a_i are real, distinct, and the functions are elements of the continuous function space.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"show that {e^{a_i t} form a linearly independent set\". The user mentioned trying the approach where a linear combination equals zero implies all coefficients are zero. The confusion came from the suggestion that each term must be positive, but the user points out that the coefficients could be negative, so that's not directly helpful.\n\nThe key here is to structure the problem correctly. The assumptions should include that each a_i is a real number, they are distinct, the functions e^{a_i t} belong to C^0(R, R), and the linear combination equals zero for all t. The problem is to show that this implies all coefficients are zero, hence proving linear independence.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which was part of the original problem. In this case, the problem here is to show linear independence given the distinctness of a_i. So the assumptions are:\n\n- Each a_i is a real number.\n- The a_i are distinct for different i.\n- The functions e^{a_i t} are in the space C^0(R, R).\n- A linear combination μ₁e^{a₁t} + ... + μₙe^{aₙt} = 0 for all t ∈ R.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement is to show linear independence, which by definition means that the only linear combination equal to the zero function is the trivial one. So perhaps the assumption includes that the linear combination equals zero for all t, and the conclusion is that all coefficients are zero. But in the example, the assumptions were given in the problem. So maybe here, the main assumptions are:\n\n1. The set {a_i} (from i=0 to n) consists of distinct real numbers.\n2. Each function e^{a_i t} is in C^0(R, R).\n3. The linear combination μ₁e^{a₁t} + ... + μₙe^{aₙt} equals the zero function for all real numbers t.\n\nThen the problem is to show that all μ_i must be zero, which proves linear independence.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in the original problem here, the user's problem is to show linear independence given distinct a_i. So the structured problem's assumption should list the given conditions: the a_i are distinct real numbers, the functions are in the specified space, and perhaps implicitly that we're considering linear independence over the real numbers.\n\nBut the key assumptions are the distinctness of the exponents a_i and that the functions are in the continuous space. The problem is to show they're linearly independent. So the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Each a_i is a real number for i = 0, 1, ..., n.\n- a_i ≠ a_j for all i ≠ j.\n- The functions e^{a_i t} are elements of C^0(ℝ, ℝ).\n- The linear combination μ₁e^{a₁t} + ... + μₙe^{aₙt} = 0 for all t ∈ ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nShow that μ₁ = μ₂ = ... = μₙ = 0.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"show that {e^{a_i t} form a linearly independent set\", which by definition requires that any finite linear combination equaling zero implies all coefficients are zero. So the problem is to prove linear independence given the distinct a_i.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should list the given conditions as per the problem statement, which are:\n\n- {a_i}_{i=0}^n are distinct real numbers.\n- The functions {e^{a_i t} are in C^0(ℝ, ℝ).\n\nProblem: Show that {e^{a_i t} are linearly independent.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are each individual conditions. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each i in {0, 1, ..., n}, a_i is a real number.\n- For all i ≠ j in {0, 1, ..., n}, a_i ≠ a_j.\n- For each i in {0, 1, ..., n}, the function e^{a_i t} is in C^0(ℝ, ℝ).\n\nProblem: Show that the set {e^{a_i t} is linearly independent.\n\nBut the example included the divisibility condition as a separate assumption. So in this case, the distinctness is one assumption per pair. Wait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So here, we can list each a_i is real, and the a_i are distinct. The functions being in C^0 is perhaps part of the problem setup, but maybe redundant since exponential functions are continuous. However, since the problem mentions C^0, it's better to include it.\n\nSo the structured answer would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Each element of {a_i}_{i=0}^n is a real number.\n- The elements of {a_i}_{i=0}^n are pairwise distinct.\n- Each function e^{a_i t} is an element of C^0(ℝ, ℝ).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set {e^{a_i t} is linearly independent in C^0(ℝ, ℝ).\n\nBut in the example, the problem part restates the expression and the conclusion. Here, the problem is to show linear independence, so the problem line would be exactly that. The user's original problem mentions using the approach of setting the linear combination to zero and showing coefficients must be zero. So perhaps the problem statement should be phrased as such, but according to the example, the problem is presented as the original statement.\n\nIn the example, the problem was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" Here, the original problem is \"show that {e^{a_i t} form a linearly independent set.\" So the formatted problem should be as per that, with the assumptions being the distinct a_i and their reality.\n\nBut let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were n is integer and n divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't specify that n must be divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example given by the user might have a mistake. Because in the original problem, the user says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But 91 is 7*13. So maybe the correct assumptions are that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be correct. Hmm, perhaps the example is not properly structured. But regardless, the task is to follow the format as per the user's example.\n\nSo in the user's example, the assumptions were two: n is integer, n divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That might be an error, but we have to follow the user's format.\n\nSo in the current problem, the user's question is to show linear independence given distinct a_i. The assumptions would be:\n\n- Each a_i is a real number (for i from 0 to n).\n- The a_i are distinct (pairwise).\n- The functions e^{a_i t} are in C^0(R, R).\n\nProblem: Show that these functions form a linearly independent set.\n\nAlternatively, since linear independence is about any linear combination being zero implies coefficients are zero, the problem could be phrased as \"Show that if μ₁e^{a₁t} + ... + μₙe^{aₙt} = 0 for all t ∈ ℝ, then μ₁=...=μₙ=0.\"\n\nBut the user's example phrased the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\". So in this case, the problem would be to \"Show that {e^{a_i t} form a linearly independent set in C^0(ℝ, ℝ).\"\n\nBut let me check the user's original question again. The original question says: \"show that { e^{a_i t } } form a linearly independent set of functions.\" The problem is structured as per the example. So the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nThus, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each i in {0, 1, ..., n}, a_i is a real number.\n- For all i ≠ j in {0, 1, ..., n}, a_i ≠ a_j.\n- For each i in {0, 1, ..., n}, e^{a_i t} is an element of C^0(ℝ, ℝ).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set {e^{a_i t} }_{i=0}^n is linearly independent in C^0(ℝ, ℝ).\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is one line per property. So perhaps each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property applied to one object. For example, the first assumption is that each a_i is real. The second is that they are distinct. The third is that each function is in the space. Each as separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Each element of $\\{a_i\\}_{i=0}^n$ is a real number.\n- The elements of $\\{a_i\\}_{i=0}^n$ are pairwise distinct.\n- Each function $e^{a_i t}$ is an element of $C^0(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set $\\{e^{a_i t}\\}$ forms a linearly independent set in $C^0(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{R})$.",
