    "Content": "I'd like an exposition of the proof that there is a subgroup of $SO(3)$ isomorphic to $F_2$, the free group on two elements. This is a key step in the proof of the Banach-Tarski paradox . The usual generators chosen for this are rotations about the $x$ and $z$ axes by $\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac13\\right)$. Wikipedia attempts to describe a proof, but it is too terse for my liking; perhaps someone here can fill in the gaps. Let $a$ be a rotation of $\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$ about the first, $x$ axis, and $b$ be a rotation of $\\theta$ about the $z$ axis (there are many other suitable pairs of irrational multiples of $\\pi$, that could be used here as well). The group of rotations generated by $a$ and $b$ will be called $H$. \n  Let $\\omega$ be an element of $H$ which starts with a rotation on the $z$ axis, of the form $\\omega=\\ldots a^{k_1}b^{k_2} \\ldots b^{n}$ [I think this is trying to say that the shortest word expressing $\\omega$ is of the form $xb$ for some word $x$]. It can be shown by induction that $\\omega$ maps the point $(1,0,0)$ to $\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac i {3^N}, \\frac{j\\sqrt 2}{3^N}, \\frac k {3^N}\\right)$, for some $i,j,k \\in \\mathbb Z,N \\in \\mathbb N$. Analysing $i,j$ and $k$ modulo 3, one can show that $j\\neq 0$. The same argument repeated (by symmetry of the problem) is valid for the opposite rotation about the $z$ axis, as well as rotations about the $x$ axis. This shows that for any non trivial word $\\rho \\in H$, then $\\rho \\neq e$. Therefore, the group $H$ is a free group, isomorphic to $F_2$. Edit: To clarify what I am looking for, I want a concise but rigorous proof of the above statement. The WP proof says \"one can show\" too much.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For the \"by induction\" statement: Let $T$ be the set of matrices with entries $a_{ij}$ such that $a_{ij}\\in\\Bbb Z$ if $i+j$ is even and $a_{ij}\\in\\Bbb Z\\sqrt 2$ if $i+j$ is odd, that is, of the form $$\\begin{pmatrix}\\Bbb Z&\\Bbb Z\\sqrt2&\\Bbb Z\\\\\\Bbb Z\\sqrt2&\\Bbb Z&\\Bbb Z\\sqrt2\\\\\\Bbb Z&\\Bbb Z\\sqrt2&\\Bbb Z\\end{pmatrix}.$$ Then $T$ forms a subring of $M(3,\\Bbb R)$. Clearly $I,0\\in T$ and $T$ is closed under addition. To show that $T$ is closed under multiplication, suppose $A,B\\in T$, with elements $(a_{ij}),(b_{ij})$. Then the product is $c_{ij}=\\sum_{k=1}^3a_{ik}b_{kj}$. If $i+j$ is even, then every element in the sum is either $a_{ik}b_{kj}\\in\\Bbb Z\\cdot \\Bbb Z$ if $k$ is even or $a_{ik}b_{kj}\\in\\sqrt 2\\Bbb Z\\cdot \\sqrt 2\\Bbb Z=2\\Bbb Z$ if $k$ is odd, so the sum is also in $\\Bbb Z$, or else $i+j$ is odd, in which case one of the two terms is in $\\Bbb Z$ and the other is in $\\sqrt 2\\Bbb Z$ hence the product is in $\\sqrt 2\\Bbb Z$ and the sum of these is also in $\\sqrt 2\\Bbb Z$. Thus $AB\\in T$. Note also that $$3a=\\begin{pmatrix}3&0&0\\\\0&1&-2\\sqrt2\\\\0&2\\sqrt2&1\\end{pmatrix}\\in T\\qquad3b=\\begin{pmatrix}1&-2\\sqrt2&0\\\\2\\sqrt2&1&0\\\\0&0&3\\end{pmatrix}\\in T,$$\nso for any product $M$ of $n$ terms selected from $\\{a,b,a^{-1},b^{-1}\\}$, we have $3^nM\\in T$, and since applying this to $v=(1,0,0)$ extracts the top row, we have $3^nMv=(i,j\\sqrt 2,k)$ for some $i,j,k\\in\\Bbb Z$ as desired. \"Analyzing modulo 3\": Consider taking the coefficients of the matrix $\\bmod 3$ (treated as elements of $\\Bbb Z[\\sqrt2]$). This has the effect of simply reducing the coefficient of an element of the form $\\Bbb Z\\sqrt2$ (there are no mixed terms $a+b\\sqrt2$). Dropping the $\\sqrt2$ from the $a_{ij}$, $i+j$ odd entries and denoting $-1$ as $\\bar 1$, we get: $$[3a]=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0\\\\0&1&1\\\\0&\\bar 1&1\\end{pmatrix}\\quad\n[3a^{-1}]=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0\\\\0&1&\\bar 1\\\\0&1&1\\end{pmatrix}\\quad\n[3b]=\\begin{pmatrix}1&1&0\\\\\\bar 1&1&0\\\\0&0&0\\end{pmatrix}\\quad\n[3b^{-1}]=\\begin{pmatrix}1&\\bar 1&0\\\\1&1&0\\\\0&0&0\\end{pmatrix}$$ These matrices share the common pattern of having a $2\\times2$ block of $1$'s, with a single $\\bar 1$ in the block and $0$ outside. Now consider the following four matrices: $$A=[3a]=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0\\\\0&1&1\\\\0&\\bar 1&1\\end{pmatrix}\\quad\nB=\\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0\\\\0&1&1\\\\0&1&\\bar 1\\end{pmatrix}\\quad\nC=\\begin{pmatrix}0&1&\\bar 1\\\\0&1&1\\\\0&0&0\\end{pmatrix}\\quad\nD=\\begin{pmatrix}0&\\bar 1&1\\\\0&1&1\\\\0&0&0\\end{pmatrix}$$ It turns out that matrices of this form and their negatives are closed under left multiplication by the generators, which constitutes a proof of the goal because the identity matrix is not of this form. Here is the multiplication table: \\begin{array}{c|cccc}\\times&A&B&C&D\\\\\\hline\n[3a]=A&-A&0&A&A\\\\\n[3a^{-1}]&0&-B&B&B\\\\\n[3b]&C&C&-C&0\\\\\n[3b^{-1}]&D&D&0&-D\n\\end{array} The $0$ elements are because $[3a^{-1}][3a]=[9I]$ is divisible by $3$ and so is equal to $0$, but can only occur if the word $M$ is not reduced (contains adjacent cancelling pairs) - for example $[3a]B=0$, but $\\pm B$ only arises from a product $[3a^{-1}]x$ for some $x\\in\\{A,B,C,D\\}$. This proves that if $M$ is any product of $n$ terms selected from $\\{a,b,a^{-1},b^{-1}\\}$ whose last term is $a$ and with no cancelling pairs, $[3^nM]\\in\\{\\pm A,\\pm B,\\pm C,\\pm D\\}$, but $[3^nI]=0$. Thus $M\\ne I$. Argumentation by symmetry (or with a different set of matrices) also establishes the result for words that end in $a^{-1},b,b^{-1}$, so we have that $M\\ne I$ for any nontrivial word.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is asking for an exposition of the proof that there's a subgroup of SO(3) isomorphic to F2, the free group on two elements. They mention that the usual generators are rotations about the x and z axes by θ = arccos(1/3). The user finds the Wikipedia proof too terse and wants a more detailed, rigorous proof. They also provide some steps from the existing proof, like considering an element ω in H (the generated group) starting with a rotation on the z-axis, showing it maps a specific point to a certain form, and using induction and modulo analysis to show j ≠ 0. This is supposed to lead to the conclusion that no non-trivial word is the identity, hence H is free.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions should be individual conditions applied to one object each. Let's parse through the question.\n\nFirst, the problem is about a subgroup of SO(3) isomorphic to F2. The key elements mentioned are:\n\n1. The group SO(3) – so we're dealing with 3D rotations.\n2. Two specific generators: rotation a about the x-axis by θ = arccos(1/3) and rotation b about the z-axis by the same θ. The problem mentions that these are suitable pairs of irrational multiples of π, but maybe that's more part of the setup than an assumption. Wait, the user says \"there are many other suitable pairs...\", so perhaps the specific angle is an assumption here. So the angle θ is arccos(1/3), which is a specific value.\n\nThe user then defines H as the group generated by a and b. They talk about an element ω in H starting with a rotation on the z-axis, meaning the reduced word starts with b (since a is x-axis, b is z-axis). The induction step maps (1,0,0) to (i/3^N, j√2/3^N, k/3^N) with integers i,j,k, natural N. Then modulo 3 analysis shows j ≠ 0. Similarly for other rotations. Then concludes that any non-trivial word isn't the identity, hence H is free.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a rotation about the x-axis by θ = arccos(1/3).\n- b is a rotation about the z-axis by θ = arccos(1/3).\n- H is the group generated by a and b.\n- ω is an element of H starting with a rotation on the z-axis (i.e., in reduced form, starts with b or its inverse).\n- The induction shows the image of (1,0,0) under ω has specific coordinates with j ≠ 0 mod 3.\n- Similar analysis applies to other axis rotations (symmetry).\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the proof of the statement that H is free. So the problem is to prove that H is isomorphic to F2. The assumptions for the problem would be the conditions given in the setup. But the user's original problem is a bit more about the structure. Let me try to list the assumptions based on the problem's setup.\n\nThe problem's setup specifies:\n\n- a and b are rotations in SO(3) about x and z axes, respectively, each by angle θ = arccos(1/3).\n- H is the subgroup generated by a and b.\n- The proof outline involves showing that any non-trivial word in H is not the identity, by analyzing the image of a point under such words, leading to a contradiction if the word were trivial.\n\nBut when structuring the assumptions, each should be a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- a is an element of SO(3).\n- a is a rotation about the x-axis.\n- The angle of rotation of a is θ = arccos(1/3).\n- b is an element of SO(3).\n- b is a rotation about the z-axis.\n- The angle of rotation of b is θ = arccos(1/3).\n- H is the subgroup of SO(3) generated by a and b.\n- ω is a non-trivial element of H.\n- Any non-trivial reduced word in H either starts with a rotation about the x-axis or the z-axis (but maybe this is part of the problem's structure, not assumption).\nWait, but the user's example had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which are two separate assumptions. So here, each line should address a single property of a single object.\n\nLooking back at the example: the original problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions were that n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition. So in the current problem, the key given conditions are:\n\n1. a is a rotation in SO(3) about the x-axis with angle θ = arccos(1/3).\n2. b is a rotation in SO(3) about the z-axis with the same angle θ.\n3. H is the subgroup generated by a and b.\n\nBut also, the problem mentions that ω is an element starting with a rotation on the z-axis, but that might be part of the proof technique rather than assumptions. The user's problem statement is to prove that H is isomorphic to F2. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions given for a, b, H. The problem is to show H is free of rank 2.\n\nWait, but maybe the angle being arccos(1/3) is important because that gives specific properties needed for the induction and modulo analysis. So the key assumptions are the definitions of a and b with that specific angle. So in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: a is a rotation about the x-axis with angle θ = arccos(1/3),\nAssumption: b is a rotation about the z-axis with angle θ = arccos(1/3),\nAssumption: H is the subgroup of SO(3) generated by a and b,\nProblem: Prove that H is isomorphic to the free group F2.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption was split into two lines even for the same object (n is an integer; n is divisible by 7). Similarly here, each property is separate. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is an element of SO(3),\na is a rotation about the x-axis,\nThe angle of rotation of a is θ = arccos(1/3),\nb is an element of SO(3),\nb is a rotation about the z-axis,\nThe angle of rotation of b is θ = arccos(1/3),\nH is the subgroup of SO(3) generated by a and b.\n\nProblem: Prove that H is isomorphic to the free group F2.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So each assumption line addresses a single property. So for a, each property (being in SO(3), being a rotation about x-axis, angle θ) are separate assumptions. Similarly for b.\n\nBut perhaps the fact that a and b are elements of SO(3) is given since H is a subgroup of SO(3). But maybe the user's problem doesn't need to state that a and b are in SO(3) because the problem is about a subgroup of SO(3). However, the problem statement on Math Stack Exchange does mention that a and b are rotations in SO(3). So to be precise, the assumptions should include that a and b are elements of SO(3), their axes, their angles, and that H is generated by them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle being arccos(1/3) is one assumption per generator. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example:\nAssumption: n is an integer,\nAssumption: n is divisible by 7.\n\nSo each line is a separate condition. So here, for a:\n\nAssumption: a is an element of SO(3),\nAssumption: a is a rotation about the x-axis,\nAssumption: The angle of rotation of a is θ = arccos(1/3),\nSimilarly for b:\n\nAssumption: b is an element of SO(3),\nAssumption: b is a rotation about the z-axis,\nAssumption: The angle of rotation of b is θ = arccos(1/3),\nAssumption: H is the subgroup of SO(3) generated by a and b.\n\nBut maybe the fact that a and b are in SO(3) is part of the problem's context and not an explicit assumption. However, the problem states that H is a subgroup of SO(3), so perhaps the user is taking that as given. The problem is to prove H is free, given that H is generated by these specific rotations. So the key assumptions are the specific rotations a and b with angle arccos(1/3) about x and z axes, and H being the group they generate.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\na is a rotation about the x-axis with angle θ = arccos(1/3),\nb is a rotation about the z-axis with angle θ = arccos(1/3),\nH is the subgroup of SO(3) generated by a and b.\n\nProblem: Prove that H is isomorphic to the free group F2.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption was on its own line, even if they applied to the same object. Wait, in the example, the user had two separate assumptions about n: being integer and divisible by 7. Here, each generator has multiple properties: which axis they rotate about, their angle. So each of these would be separate lines. But maybe in the original problem, the angle is arccos(1/3) for both a and b. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a rotation about the x-axis,\na has angle θ = arccos(1/3),\nb is a rotation about the z-axis,\nb has angle θ = arccos(1/3),\nH is the subgroup of SO(3) generated by a and b.\n\nProblem: Prove that H is isomorphic to the free group F2.\n\nThis way, each line is a single property of a single object. That seems to fit the example's structure. The problem is to show that under these conditions, H is free. So this should be correct.",
