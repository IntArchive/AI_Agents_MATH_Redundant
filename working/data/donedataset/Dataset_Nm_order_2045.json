    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving an infinite series involving the Gamma function, Digamma function, and other constants. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the original problem, the series starts at n=0 and goes to infinity. The terms of the series involve Gamma(n + 1/2), Digamma(n + 1/2), factorial n!, and (n + 3/2)^2. \n\nSo, possible assumptions here are about the variables and functions involved. The index n starts at 0 and is an integer because it's a summation index. The functions Gamma and Digamma are evaluated at n + 1/2, which are valid since Gamma is defined for all complex numbers except non-positive integers, and here n is a non-negative integer, so n + 1/2 is always a positive real number, so Gamma is defined. Similarly, the Digamma function is the logarithmic derivative of Gamma, so it's defined wherever Gamma is defined and non-zero. \n\nThe denominator has n! which is defined for non-negative integers n, which aligns with the summation index. The term (n + 3/2)^2 is squared, so it's always positive. \n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions Euler-Mascheroni constant γ and the Digamma function ψ(z), which are standard mathematical constants and functions. The problem wants to prove the equality of the series to a specific expression involving π, γ, and log 2. \n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The summation index n starts at 0 and goes to infinity.\n2. Each term in the series involves Γ(n + 1/2), which is the Gamma function evaluated at n + 1/2.\n3. Each term involves ψ(n + 1/2), the Digamma function evaluated at n + 1/2.\n4. The denominator of each term is n! multiplied by (n + 3/2)^2.\n5. The series is summed over all non-negative integers n.\n6. The equality involves the Euler-Mascheroni constant γ and the Digamma function ψ.\n\nEach of these points addresses a specific property or condition applied to one object (like n, Γ, ψ, etc.). I need to make sure each assumption is separate and doesn't combine multiple conditions into one line. Let me check again:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer (since summation starts at 0 and increments by 1).\n- Γ is evaluated at n + 1/2, which is valid.\n- ψ is evaluated at n + 1/2, which is valid.\n- The denominator components: n! and (n + 3/2)^2.\n- The series is infinite (sum from 0 to infinity).\n\nAlso, the problem statement includes specific constants (γ, π, log 2) in the result, but those are part of the problem's conclusion, not assumptions. The assumptions should be about the given terms in the problem statement, not the result.\n\nSo the assumptions list would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nΓ(z) is the Gamma function evaluated at z = n + 1/2,\nψ(z) is the Digamma function evaluated at z = n + 1/2,\neach term of the series is divided by n!,\neach term of the series is divided by (n + 3/2)^2,\nthe series is summed from n = 0 to infinity.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption for the original problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the user might have included conditions that are part of the problem's hypothesis. But in the current problem, the problem is to prove an equality, so the assumptions are more about the definitions and conditions under which the series is defined. Since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumptions are the components that make the series well-defined and the functions involved. \n\nSo, I need to list each component as a separate assumption. Let me structure them:\n\n1. The summation index n is a non-negative integer (since the series starts at n=0 and goes to ∞).\n2. Γ(n + 1/2) is the Gamma function at half-integer values.\n3. ψ(n + 1/2) is the Digamma function at half-integer values.\n4. Each term includes division by n!.\n5. Each term includes division by (n + 3/2)^2.\n6. The series is summed from n=0 to ∞.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption about the components of the problem. The Gamma and Digamma functions are standard, but specifying their arguments here is necessary. The denominator components are also part of the term's structure. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions listed line by line, followed by the problem statement as given.",
