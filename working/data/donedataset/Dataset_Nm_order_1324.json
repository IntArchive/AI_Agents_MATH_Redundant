    "Content": "Any matrix $A \\in \\mbox{GL}(n, \\mathbb{C})$ can be written as a finite linear combination of elements $U_i\\in U(n)$ : $$ A = \\sum_{i} \\lambda_i U_i$$ Is this true? How could I prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The reference to the MathOverflow question is a good one. If $A$ is a complex matrix, you can normalize so that $\\|A\\| \\le 1$. Then\n$$\n                 A = B + iC\n$$\nwhere $B$, $C$ are selfadjoint and given by\n$$\n               B = \\frac{1}{2}(A+A^{\\star}),\\;\\;\\; C=\\frac{1}{2i}(A-A^{\\star}).\n$$\nThese selfadjoint operators also satisfy $\\|B\\| \\le 1$ and $\\|C\\|\\le 1$, which means that their eigenvalues--which must be real--are in $[-1,1]$. Then you can decompose $B$ and $C$ as\n$$\n         B = \\frac{1}{2}(U_{B}+V_{B}),\\;\\;\\; C=\\frac{1}{2}(U_{C}+V_{C})\n$$\nwhere $U_{B}, V_{B}, U_{C}, V_{C}$ are unitary and given by\n$$\n           U_{B} = B + i\\sqrt{I-B^2},\\;\\; V_{B}=B-i\\sqrt{I-B^2} \\\\\n           U_{C} = C + i\\sqrt{I-C^2},\\;\\; V_{C}=C-i\\sqrt{I-C^2}\n$$\nThis makes sense becaue $I-B^2$ and $I-C^2$ are selfadjoint with their eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; so the square roots are defined that also have eigenvalues in $[0,1]$. You can check that\n$$\n     U_{B}U_{B}^{\\star}= U_{B}^{\\star}U_{B} = (B-i\\sqrt{I-B^2})(B+i\\sqrt{I-B^2})=B^2+(I-B^2)=I.\n$$\nThen $\\frac{1}{2}(U_{B}+V_{B})=B$, $\\frac{1}{2}(U_{C}+V_{C})=C$ and $A=B+iC$ is a linear combination of unitary matrices.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is asking whether every invertible complex matrix can be written as a finite linear combination of unitary matrices. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions that A is in GL(n, ℂ), which means it's an invertible n×n complex matrix. So the first assumption is about the matrix A being in GL(n, ℂ). Then, the question is whether A can be expressed as a sum of unitary matrices with coefficients λ_i. However, I need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the coefficients λ_i, so maybe they are just complex numbers. The unitary matrices U_i are elements of U(n), which means each U_i is an n×n unitary matrix. \n\nWait, the original question says \"finite linear combination,\" so the sum is finite. Each term in the sum is λ_i times U_i, where U_i is unitary. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. A is an element of GL(n, ℂ), so A is invertible.\n2. Each U_i is a unitary matrix (i.e., in U(n)).\n3. The coefficients λ_i are complex numbers.\n4. The sum is finite.\n\nBut the example provided in the user's instruction had assumptions that applied to one object each. In the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer,\" and the second was \"n is divisible by 7.\" So here, for each object, we need to state their properties. The main objects here are matrix A, each U_i, coefficients λ_i, and the sum being finite. So each assumption line should address one property of one object.\n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an element of GL(n, ℂ),\nEach U_i is an element of U(n),\nEach λ_i is a complex number,\nThe sum is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove that any matrix A ∈ GL(n, ℂ) can be written as a finite linear combination ∑λ_i U_i of unitary matrices U_i ∈ U(n).\n\nWait, but the original question didn't specify whether the coefficients are restricted. The problem says \"finite linear combination,\" which in linear algebra terms usually means coefficients from the underlying field (here, complex numbers). So the assumptions would be that A is invertible, each U_i is unitary, and the combination is finite with complex coefficients. I think that's all. The problem doesn't mention any other constraints. So the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then state the problem as proving that such a decomposition exists.",
