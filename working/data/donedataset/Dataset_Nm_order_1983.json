    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that $$\nVf(x)=\\int_0^1f(t)k(x,t)\\,dt,\n$$ where $k(x,t)=1_{[0,x]}(t)$ . It is a general fact that such an operator is Hilbert-Schmidt (and in particular compact) if and only if $k\\in L^2([0,1]^2)$ . Or one can show that the measurable function $k$ is a uniform limit of simple functions, and these simple functions can be used as kernels to define operators that approximate $V$ . As these operators are finite-rank, $V$ is compact. As for the eigenvalues, if $\\lambda\\ne0$ and $Vf=\\lambda f$ , then we get $$\\tag{1}\nf(x)=\\frac1\\lambda\\,\\int_0^xf(t)\\,dt.\n$$ Using that $f$ is in $L^2$ we have, for $x<y$ , \\begin{align}\n|f(y)-f(x)|&=\\frac1{|\\lambda|}\\,\\left|\\int_x^yf(t)dt\\right|\\leq\\frac1{|\\lambda|}\\,\\int_x^y|f(t)|dt=\\frac1{|\\lambda|}\\,\\int_0^1|f(t)|\\,1_{[x,y]}(t)\\,dt\\\\ &\\leq\\frac{\\|f\\|_2}{|\\lambda|}\\,\\left(\\int_0^1(1_{[x,y]})^2\\,dt\\right)^{1/2}=\\frac{\\|f\\|_2}{|\\lambda|}\\,\\sqrt{y-x}.\n\\end{align} So $f$ is continuous. Then looking at (1) again we get that $f$ is differentiable; thus, after differentiation, (1) is the equation $f=\\lambda f'$ . This implies that $f(t)=c\\,e^{ t/\\lambda}$ . But $f(0)=0$ , so the only solution for (1) is $f=0$ , and $\\lambda$ cannot be an eigenvalue. The case $\\lambda =0$ is trivial: if $Vf=0$ , then $f=0$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is \"Prove that the Volterra operator is compact but has no nonzero eigenvalues,\" and the question defines the Volterra operator V acting on L²[0,1] by (Vf)(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy. They need help proving two things: compactness and the absence of nonzero eigenvalues.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions the Volterra operator V, which is defined on L²[0,1]. So one assumption is the operator's domain and codomain: V: L²[0,1] → L²[0,1]. Then, the specific definition of V is another assumption, so (Vf)(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy. The problem asks to prove two properties: compactness and no nonzero eigenvalues. But assumptions are the given conditions, not what needs to be proven. So I should check if there are any hidden assumptions. For instance, the space L²[0,1] is a Hilbert space, which might be relevant, but is that an assumption or general knowledge? Since it's given in the problem statement, it's part of the setup. However, the problem doesn't state any additional conditions like specific functions or parameters, so the main assumptions are the definition of V and its domain.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"Volterra operator is defined as operator V: L²[0,1]→L²[0,1] by (Vf)(x)=∫₀ˣ f(y) dy.\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. V is an operator from L²[0,1] to L²[0,1].\n2. V is defined by (Vf)(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy for f ∈ L²[0,1].\n\nThese are the given conditions. The problem then is to prove two things: compactness of V and that V has no nonzero eigenvalues. The user's example had assumptions listed as each being one property or condition applied to one object. So each assumption here is about V's domain and its definition. The problem part is the two statements to prove. However, in the example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7, which was part of the problem's original statement. Here, there's no such extra condition beyond the operator's definition and space. So the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and then state the problem as proving compactness and no nonzero eigenvalues.\n\nWait, but the original problem in the example had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the given problem here, there's no such condition. The Volterra operator is just defined generally. So perhaps the assumptions are only the operator's definition and the space it acts on.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an operator from L²[0,1] to L²[0,1],\nV is defined by (Vf)(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy for all f ∈ L²[0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Volterra operator V is compact but has no nonzero eigenvalues.\n\nWait, but the original example split each assumption into separate lines. So each line is one assumption. Here, the first assumption is the domain and codomain of V. The second is the definition of V. So that's two separate assumptions.\n\nThus, the formatted answer should have:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an operator from L²[0,1] to L²[0,1],\nV is defined by (Vf)(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(y) dy for each f ∈ L²[0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that V is compact but has no nonzero eigenvalues.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example included two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, the two assumptions are the operator's space and its definition. The problem part is the two properties to prove. So the answer should be structured accordingly.",
