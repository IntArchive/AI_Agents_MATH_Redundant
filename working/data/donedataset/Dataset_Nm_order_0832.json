    "Content": "For some open sets $U$, $V$ in the complex plane, let $f:U\\rightarrow V$ be an injective holomorphic function. Then $f'(z) \\ne 0$ for $z \\in U$. Now I don't understand the proof, but here it is from my text. My comments are in italics. \nSuppose $f(z_0) = 0$ for some $z_0 \\in U$. $f(z) - f(z_0) = a(z - z_0)^k + G(z)$ for all $z$ near $z_0$, with $a \\ne 0, k \\ge 2.$\nAlso, $G$ vanishes to order $k+1$ at $z_0$. I'm not clear on what this \"vanishing\" thing means. Maybe it means that $G$ can be expressed as a power series of order $k+1$ around $z_0$. For sufficiently small $w$ we can write $f(z) - f(z_0) - w = F(z) + G(z)$, where $F(z) = a(z - z_0)^k - w$. I'm not sure why we need to have $w$ small. This equation will work for any $w$. Since $|G(z)| \\lt |F(z)|$ on a small circle centered at $z_0$, and $F$ has at least two zeros inside that circle, Rouche's theorem implies that $f(z) - f(z_0) - w$ has a least two zeros there. Now I think that $|G(z)| \\lt |F(z)|$ can follow simply from the fact that $F$ is a polynomial of degree $k$ while $G$ has degree $k+1$. And the remark about the two zeros can follow from the fact that $F$ must have $k$ zeros in the complex plane. But the first part requires that we consider $z$ only on a small circle. The second part requires that our circle be big enough to capture two zeros. How do we know that we can satisfy both? Since $f'(z) \\ne 0$ for for all $z \\ne z_0$ sufficiently close to $z_0$, the roots of $f(z) - f(z_0) - w$ are distinct, so $f$ is not injective - a contradiction. I think that the derivative is never zero for values of $z$ other than $z_0$ because otherwise we would have a sequence of zeros limiting towards $z_0$ which would cause our function to be constant which is a contradiction. But again we have the same problem - we can only consider a small circle. The roots of $f$ may lie outside this circle.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First comment: Yes. I prefer to write $(z-z_0)^k\\cdot(a+(z-z_0)H(z))$ in such proofs. Second comment: $w$ small is not needed immediately, but we can only use a small circle (as guaranted by openness of $U$) and want to have $(z-z_0)^k=w$ at least once (end hence $k$ times) inside that circle. This is what forces $w$ to be small. Third comment: We make our circle even smaller (and may revise our choice of $w$) in order to make $|G|<| F|$. By the vanishing order of $G$, we have $G(z)\\le c\\cdot |z-z_0|^{k+1}$ for some $c$ as long as $z\\approx z_0$ (with my notation above, you can take any $c>|H(z_0)|$). Then what we need here for $|G(z)|<|F(z)|$ if $|z-z_0|=r$ is to chose $r\\le \\frac ac$. The very simple polynomial $F$ has $k$ zeroes in the circle because we choose our $w$ small enough (smaller than $ar^k$ if $r$ is the radius of our small circle). Fourth comment: The zeroes of a holomorphic function are isolated unless the function is (locally) constant. If $f$ is constant on a small open disk, it is already far from injective.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, listing assumptions line by line and then the problem itself. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about why injective holomorphic functions have a nonzero derivative. The user provided the title and the question details, including some confusion about the proof.\n\nLooking at the example given, the key is to extract each assumption that applies to one object and one property. The original problem states: For some open sets U, V in the complex plane, let f: U → V be an injective holomorphic function. Then f'(z) ≠ 0 for z ∈ U.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n1. U and V are open sets in the complex plane.\n2. f: U → V is a holomorphic function.\n3. f is injective.\n\nThe problem is to show that f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"for some open sets U, V\", but in the problem statement, it's a general assertion. However, in mathematical terms, when proving such a theorem, the assumptions would include that U and V are open, f is holomorphic, and injective. Each of these is a separate condition on different objects. So U is an open set in the complex plane, V is an open set in the complex plane, f is a function from U to V, f is holomorphic, and f is injective. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- U is an open set in the complex plane.\n- V is an open set in the complex plane.\n- f: U → V is a holomorphic function.\n- f is injective.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ U.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original problem mentions that the proof is by contradiction, assuming f'(z_0) = 0 for some z_0 ∈ U. But in the structured format, we need to list the initial assumptions given in the problem statement, not the proof steps. The problem statement itself sets up the conditions: U, V open, f holomorphic and injective. The conclusion to prove is that the derivative is non-zero everywhere.\n\nSo I think that's all. The user's example had two assumptions for the number theory problem. In this case, there are four assumptions, each on separate lines, each addressing one property or condition on one object. So U being open, V being open, f being holomorphic, and f being injective. Each is a separate assumption.",
