    "AcceptedAnswer": "Use a proof by induction on $m$: $(a)$ It seems to me, then, that you have your base case $m = 2$: $P(2)$, $\\quad$ though it suffices, for a base case, to prove it's (trivially) true for $m = 1$. $\\quad$ But the process used in class for proving it's true for $m = 2$ will be helpful when making the $\\quad$ inductive step of the proof. $(b)$ Your inductive hypothesis $P(k)$ would be to assume that this is true for $m = k$. $\\quad$ That is, assume the truth of: $$P(K):\\quad\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n  A_1 &*  &*  &*  &*  &*  \\\\\n   0& A_2 &*  &*  &*  &*  \\\\\n   .&  0& A_3 &*  &*  &*  \\\\\n   .&  0&  0 &...  &*  &* \\\\\n   .&  0&  0& & ... &*  \\\\\n   0&  .&  ...&  0&0 & A_k\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\prod_{i=1}^k \\det A_i \n$$\n$(c)$ Then, take the inductive step: you'll need to use the inductive hypothesis to prove that $P(k+1)$ is true: for $m = k + 1$...\nThat is, assuming $P(k)$ is true, prove:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n  A_1 &*  &*  &*  &* &| &*  \\\\\n   0& A_2 &*  &*  &* &| &*  \\\\\n   .&  0& A_3 &*  &* &| &*  \\\\\n   .&  0&  0 &... &* &| &* \\\\\n   .&  0&  0&  ...& A_k &| &*  \\\\\n\\hline& & & &\\\\\n   0&  0&  ...&  0&0 &| & A_{k+1}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} \\det A_i \n$$ Note that to do this, you can partition the matrix into two block matrices on the diagonal , $(1)$ one of which is triangular (block) matrix with $k$ sub-blocks $A_i$ for $1 < i < k$ along it's diagonal, for which the determinant you know from the inductive hypothesis (having assumed its truth), and $(2)$ the other with one block on the diagonal which we call $A_{k+1}$. Here is where you can use the proof used in class for $m = 2$ That is: $$\\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} \\det A_i =  \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\det A_i\\right)\\cdot \\det(A_{k+1})\n$$ Then you will have shown that the determinant of a partitioned triangular matrix is product of the determinants of the block matrices on the diagonal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original problem and list them line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The user is given a partitioned upper-triangular matrix with diagonal blocks A_1, A_2, ..., A_m, and they need to prove that the determinant of this matrix is the product of the determinants of each A_i. They mention that it's already proven for m=2 and they can use that in the proof.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The matrix is partitioned into blocks. So the first assumption is that the matrix is a block matrix.\n2. It's specified as upper-triangular. So each block below the main diagonal blocks (which are A_1, A_2, etc.) is a zero block. So the matrix is block upper-triangular.\n3. Each diagonal block is A_i. So the diagonal blocks are A_1, A_2, ..., A_m.\n4. The * symbols probably represent arbitrary blocks, but since it's upper-triangular, those above the diagonal can be any blocks. So the entries above the diagonal blocks (denoted by *) are arbitrary.\n5. The problem states that the case for m=2 has already been proven and can be used. So another assumption is that the result holds when m=2.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property. Let me list them:\n\n- The matrix is a block matrix.\n- The matrix is block upper-triangular (i.e., all blocks below the diagonal blocks are zero matrices).\n- Each diagonal block is A_i for i from 1 to m.\n- The off-diagonal blocks above the main diagonal (denoted by *) are arbitrary.\n- The determinant property holds for m=2 (as given from class).\n\nWait, but the problem states \"we already proved in class that it is true for m=2 and we can use it in our proof.\" So that's an assumption given to use in the proof. So it's an assumption that the case m=2 is already established.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The matrix is partitioned into blocks.\n- The matrix is block upper-triangular (all blocks below the diagonal are zero matrices).\n- The diagonal blocks are $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_m$.\n- The determinant of a block upper-triangular matrix with two diagonal blocks ($m=2$) is the product of their determinants (given as proven).\n\nProblem: Prove that the determinant of the given matrix is $\\prod_{n=1}^m \\det A_i$.\n\nWait, but the original problem mentions that each A_i is a block matrix. Wait, the user wrote: \"each of the A_i are block-matrices.\" So each A_i is itself a block matrix. But does that affect the assumptions? The key point here is that the overall matrix is block upper-triangular with diagonal blocks A_i, which themselves can be block matrices, but the determinant formula is the product of det(A_i) regardless of their internal structure. So the assumption should include that each A_i is a square block matrix (so that their determinants are defined), but maybe that's implicit. However, the problem as stated just says \"block-matrices\" without specifying they are square. Wait, but determinants are only defined for square matrices. So perhaps an implicit assumption is that each A_i is a square matrix, and the entire block matrix is square as well. So maybe we need to add that as assumptions.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: The user says it's a partitioned upper-triangular matrix. Upper-triangular matrices are square, so the entire matrix is square. Therefore, each diagonal block A_i must be square as well, because in a block upper-triangular matrix, the diagonal blocks are square to make the matrix square overall. Therefore, each A_i is a square matrix (block matrix, but square). So perhaps that should be an assumption.\n\nSo adding that:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The matrix is a square block matrix.\n- The matrix is block upper-triangular (all blocks below the diagonal blocks are zero matrices).\n- Each diagonal block $A_i$ is a square matrix.\n- The determinant property for block upper-triangular matrices holds when $m=2$ (i.e., $\\det \\begin{bmatrix} A_1 & * \\\\ 0 & A_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\det A_1 \\det A_2$).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each of the A_i are block-matrices.\" So maybe each A_i is itself a block matrix, but that's more about their structure. However, the determinant of a block matrix is only defined if the blocks are such that the overall matrix is square. Since each A_i is a block matrix, but for the determinant to be defined, each A_i must be square as a matrix. So perhaps the key assumptions are that the entire matrix is square and block upper-triangular, each diagonal block is square (so that their determinants are defined), and the case for m=2 is given.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The given matrix is a square block matrix.\n- The given matrix is block upper-triangular (blocks below the diagonal are zero matrices).\n- Each diagonal block $A_i$ is a square matrix.\n- The determinant of a block upper-triangular matrix with two diagonal blocks is the product of their determinants (proven in class).\n\nProblem: Prove that the determinant of the matrix is $\\prod_{n=1}^m \\det A_i$.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original example had the user write assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", but in the original problem, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted the problem as:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems wrong, because the original problem didn't assume n is divisible by 7, but wanted divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But maybe the example was a mistake. Anyway, the user's example may have been incorrect, but we need to follow the instructions given.\n\nBut in our current problem, the user's original question says that the matrix is partitioned, upper-triangular, with diagonal blocks A_i, which are themselves block matrices. We have to state the assumptions. The key points are:\n\n1. Matrix is partitioned into blocks (block matrix).\n2. It's upper-triangular in the block structure, meaning blocks below the diagonal are zero.\n3. Each diagonal block is A_i, which are themselves block matrices (but the problem likely needs each A_i to be square, as determinants are involved).\n4. The result for m=2 is given.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The matrix is a square block matrix.\n- The matrix is block upper-triangular (blocks below the main diagonal are zero matrices).\n- Each diagonal block $A_i$ is a square matrix.\n- The determinant of a 2x2 block upper-triangular matrix is the product of the determinants of its diagonal blocks (given).\n\nProblem: Prove that the determinant of the matrix is the product of the determinants of the diagonal blocks $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_m$.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user writes \"the determinant of this general matrix is: product det A_i\". So the problem is exactly that.\n\nSo formatting accordingly:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: The matrix is a square block matrix.\nAssumption: The matrix is block upper-triangular (all blocks below the diagonal are zero matrices).\nAssumption: Each diagonal block $A_i$ is a square matrix.\nAssumption: The determinant of a block upper-triangular matrix with two diagonal blocks is the product of their determinants (proven in class).\nProblem: Prove that the determinant of the given matrix is $\\prod_{n=1}^m \\det A_i$.",
