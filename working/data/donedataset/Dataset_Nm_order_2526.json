    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a super-pretty, and very poweful, theorem which you can use here. Its proof is not so hard (probably master's level). Reference is: Baumslag, Benjamin; Pride, Stephen J. Groups with two more generators than relators. J. London Math. Soc. (2) 17 (1978), no.3, 425–426. Theorem (B.Baumslag-Pride). If $G$ admits a presentation with $2$ more generators than relators, then $G$ contains a finite index subgroup which surjects onto the free group of rank $2$ , $F_2$ . In modern parlance, $G$ is large . To apply this to your problem, note that by considering abelianisations of one-relator groups, if $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ is an $n$ -generator one-relator group then $n\\geq3$ . As $3-1\\geq2$ , the Baumslag-Pride theorem then says that $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ contains a finite index subgroup $H$ which surjects onto $F_2$ . As $H$ is necessarily abelian but $F_2$ is not, we have a contradiction. Hence, $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ is not a one-relator group. In fact, using more powerful tools we can prove the following. Theorem. The only possible abelian subgroups of a one-relator group are cyclic groups and $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ . One way to prove this would be to first use (virtual) cohomological dimension to eliminate the possibility of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ for $n\\geq3$ - one relator groups have $(v)cd\\leq2$ , and hence so do all their subgroups, while $cd(\\mathbb{Z}^n)>2$ . [This argument also works for the problem in the question.] We therefore just need to eliminate $\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_m\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ as possibilities. To do this, first apply a theorem of Pride (Pride, Stephen J. The two-generator subgroups of one-relator groups with torsion. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 234 (1977), no.2, 483–496) which says that if a subgroup of a one-relator group is two-generated and contains elements of finite order, then the subgroup is itself a one-relator group, and moreover (via another deep result...) the relator is a proper power. So then: $\\mathbb{Z}_m\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is eliminated by considering abelianisations. For $\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ , we can apply a beefed-up version of the Baumslag-Pride result, due to Gromov, which states that if $G$ admits a presentation with one more generator than relator and where at least one relator is a proper power, then $G$ contains a finite index subgroup which surjects onto $F_2$ . If $\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a subgroup of a one-relator groups, then as noted above it a one-relator group where the relator is a proper power. It is also non-cyclic, and so Gromov's result applies to this one-relator presentation. However, no subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ surjects onto $F_2$ . Phew.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the group ℤ³ can be presented as a one-relator group. Let me start by recalling some basic group theory concepts. A one-relator group is a group that can be defined using a presentation with only one relator. The examples given for ℤ⁰, ℤ¹, and ℤ² are all using a single relator, which seems to be the pattern here. \n\nFirst, ℤ⁰ is the trivial group, presented as ⟨a | a⟩, which makes sense because the relator a just means the generator a is equal to the identity. Then ℤ¹ is ⟨a, b | b⟩, but wait, if we have two generators and one relator b, that would actually make b the identity, so the group is generated by a alone, which is indeed ℤ. Similarly, ℤ² is the free abelian group on two generators, presented as ⟨a, b | aba⁻¹b⁻¹⟩. The relator here is the commutator, forcing a and b to commute, hence the group is abelian and free abelian of rank 2, so ℤ².\n\nNow the question is about ℤ³. The user is wondering if there's a similar presentation with only one relator. Let me think. For ℤ³, we need three generators, say a, b, c, and we need to enforce that all three commute and that there are no other relations. Normally, ℤ³ would require the three commutators: [a,b], [a,c], [b,c], but that's three relators. The question is whether we can somehow combine these into a single relator.\n\nBut wait, in the examples given for ℤ², the relator is the commutator of the two generators. For three generators, you might need more than one relator to enforce all the commutativity. However, maybe there's a clever way to write a single relator that implies all the necessary commutators. Alternatively, maybe not, and that's why the user is stuck.\n\nI should recall some theorems about one-relator groups. One important result is the Magnus theorem, which says that if a one-relator group has torsion, then the relator is a proper power. But ℤ³ is torsion-free, so that might not apply here. Another thought is about the rank of the group versus the number of relators. The rank of ℤ³ is 3, and normally, a presentation with fewer relators than generators tends to be a free group or similar, but with relators, it's tricky.\n\nWait, but ℤ³ is abelian. The abelianization of a one-relator group could be computed by abelianizing the presentation. If we have a one-relator presentation for an abelian group, then the relator must be a product of commutators, but in the abelianization, all commutators become trivial. Hmm, maybe this is a problem. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a presentation ⟨a, b, c | r⟩ where r is a word in a, b, c. For the group to be abelian, all the generators must commute. So the relator r must somehow enforce that a, b, c commute. But in a free group, the only way to enforce commutativity is by adding commutators as relations. However, if we have only one relator, can it encode all the necessary commutators?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more complex relator that somehow implies all the commutators. For example, if we set r to be [a,b][a,c][b,c], but that's three commutators multiplied together. Would that single relator suffice to make the group abelian? Let me test this. Suppose we have ⟨a, b, c | [a,b][a,c][b,c]⟩. If this relator is equal to the identity, does that mean each commutator is the identity? Probably not, because in a free group, the product being trivial doesn't imply each factor is trivial. So even if the product of commutators is trivial, each individual commutator might not be, so the group might not be abelian. Hence, this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different relator. Let's think of a word that involves all three generators in such a way that commuting any two generators is forced. For example, maybe a word like abacaba⁻¹c⁻1b⁻1... but it's hard to see how such a word would enforce all commutators. Alternatively, maybe a relator that is a power of a commutator, but again, that would only kill a single commutator.\n\nWait, there's a theorem called the Freiheitssatz (Freedom Theorem) by Magnus, which states that in a one-relator group, if the relator does not involve a particular generator, then the subgroup generated by the other generators is free. So, if we have three generators and one relator, then if the relator uses all three generators, the Freiheitssatz might not directly apply, but if the relator doesn't use one generator, then the other two would generate a free group. But ℤ³ is abelian, so all subgroups should be free abelian, not free. So if we have a relator that doesn't use, say, c, then the subgroup generated by a and b would be free, which contradicts ℤ³ being abelian. Therefore, perhaps any one-relator presentation for ℤ³ must involve all generators in the relator. But even then, it's unclear if such a relator can enforce the necessary commutativity.\n\nAnother approach: The abelianization of a group with presentation ⟨a, b, c | r⟩ is the abelian group generated by a, b, c modulo the relations given by the abelianization of r. The abelianization of r is the exponent sums for each generator. For the group to be ℤ³, the relator must be trivial in the abelianization, which would mean that the exponent sums for each generator in r must be zero. Otherwise, the abelianization would be a quotient of ℤ³. So, if r is in the commutator subgroup (i.e., has exponent sums zero for all generators), then the abelianization is ℤ³. But even if that's the case, the group itself might not be abelian. So even if the abelianization is ℤ³, the original group could be a non-abelian group with abelianization ℤ³. Therefore, having the relator in the commutator subgroup is necessary but not sufficient for the group to be abelian.\n\nTherefore, to get an abelian group, the relator must not only be in the commutator subgroup but also enforce that all commutators are trivial. But with a single relator, this seems impossible because you need to kill all commutators [a,b], [a,c], [b,c], which are three distinct elements. Since each of these is a generator of the commutator subgroup in the free group on three generators, you can't kill all of them with a single relator unless the relator somehow generates all three, which is not possible in a free group. Therefore, it's impossible to present ℤ³ with a single relator.\n\nHence, the answer is that it's not possible, and the problem is to prove that ℤ³ cannot be a one-relator group.",
