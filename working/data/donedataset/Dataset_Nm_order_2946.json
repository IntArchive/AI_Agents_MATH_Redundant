    "Content": "A set is a set. A magma is a set with a binary operator. A semigroup is a magma with an associative binary operator. A monoid has a two-sided identity. And a group has two-sided inverses. I am wondering about one-sided verses two-sided. Under what conditions is an identity element necessarily two-sided? Under what conditions is an inverse necessarily two-sided? And what are the simplest proofs for these? Theorems I have so far: A magma may have multiple distinct left-identities or multiple distinct right-identities, but can never have a distinct left and right identity. [1: $\\forall x. lx=x$. 2: $\\forall x. xr=x$. 1 implies that $lr=r$ while 2 implies that $lr=l$. So either $l=r$ or at least one of 1 or 2 is false.] Associativity plus the existence of a two-sided inverse is enough to imply that any inverse is two-sided. [If $y$ is the left-inverse of $x$ then $xyx = x(yx)=xi=x$. By associativity, $xyx=(xy)x=x$, which implies that $xy=i$. In other words, $y$ is also the right-inverse of $x$.] I have a feeling that an associative magma cannot have one-sided identities - but I cannot prove this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The classic result in this area is that if $G$ is a semigroup with a left identity $e$ and such that every element has a left inverse with respect to $e$, then $G$ is a group. There are proofs of this all over the place, in section 1.1 of Hungerford's Algebra for example. Of course the same holds with \"left\" replaced with \"right\" throughout. Proof: For any $g$ in $G$, we have $(gg^{-1})(gg^{-1})=g(g^{-1}g)g^{-1}=geg^{-1}=gg^{-1}$ Multiplying both sides on the left by $(gg^{-1})^{-1}$, we have $egg^{-1}=e$ and hence $gg^{-1}=e$. Thus $g^{-1}$ is in fact a two-sided inverse of $g$ (with respect to the identity $e$). Furthermore, $ge=g(g^{-1}g)=(gg^{-1})g=eg=g$, and hence $e$ is a two-sided identity. On the counterexamples side, a fertile structure to look at is any set of at least two elements with the operation $a*b=b$. This is a semigroup in which every element is a left identity, while no element is a right identity. Furthermore, if we fix a left identity $e$, then every element has a right inverse (also $e$) with respect to $e$, while only $e$ has a left inverse (in fact everything is left inverse to it). If we relax the condition \"$a$ has a left inverse\" to mean \"there exists $b$ such that $ba$ is a left identity\" (rather than picking a specific identity and sticking to it), then everything is left inverse to everything.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem based on the user's example. First, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange and extract the key assumptions and the problem itself.\n\nThe original question is about group identities and inverses, specifically asking under what conditions an identity element must be two-sided and when inverses are necessarily two-sided. The user also mentions some theorems they have so far, like in a magma with a left and right identity, they must be the same. Another point is that associativity plus two-sided inverses imply any inverse is two-sided. They also suspect that an associative magma (which would be a semigroup) can't have one-sided identities but can't prove it.\n\nSo, the main problems here are two-fold: one about identities and one about inverses. The user is asking for the conditions under which these one-sided elements must be two-sided. Let me break down the assumptions first.\n\nFor the identity part, the user mentions that in a magma, if there are both left and right identities, they must coincide. The assumptions here would be that the magma has a left identity and a right identity. Then the problem is to show that they are equal. Wait, but the user already proved that. However, they are asking under what conditions is an identity necessarily two-sided. The example given in the theorems is that in a magma with a left identity and a right identity, they must be the same. So perhaps the first problem is: In a magma, if there exists a left identity and a right identity, prove that they are equal, hence the magma has a two-sided identity.\n\nFor the inverses part, the user states that associativity plus the existence of a two-sided inverse implies that any inverse is two-sided. Wait, the user's theorem is: In a monoid (since there's a two-sided identity), if every element has a left inverse, then associativity would make those left inverses also right inverses. Wait, actually the user wrote that if y is the left inverse of x, then xyx = x, and using associativity, this implies xy is also the identity. So the assumptions here would be that we have a monoid (associative with two-sided identity) and every element has a left inverse. Then the problem is to prove that every left inverse is also a right inverse, making it a group.\n\nThe user also mentions their feeling that an associative magma (semigroup) cannot have one-sided identities. So the third problem might be: Prove that in a semigroup (associative magma), if there exists a left identity, then it is also a right identity, hence a two-sided identity.\n\nSo, the original question has three parts:\n\n1. Under what conditions is an identity element necessarily two-sided?\n2. Under what conditions is an inverse necessarily two-sided?\n3. The user's conjecture that an associative magma (semigroup) can't have one-sided identities.\n\nBut in their theorems, they already have some results. Let me structure each problem with their assumptions.\n\nFirst problem about identity:\n\nAssumptions:\n- M is a magma.\n- There exists an element l in M such that for all x in M, l * x = x (left identity).\n- There exists an element r in M such that for all x in M, x * r = x (right identity).\n\nProblem: Prove that l = r, hence M has a two-sided identity.\n\nSecond problem about inverses:\n\nAssumptions:\n- M is a monoid (associative magma with two-sided identity element e).\n- For every element x in M, there exists an element y in M such that y * x = e (left inverse).\n\nProblem: Prove that y is also a right inverse, i.e., x * y = e.\n\nThird problem (user's conjecture):\n\nAssumptions:\n- S is a semigroup (associative magma).\n- There exists an element l in S such that for all x in S, l * x = x (left identity).\n\nProblem: Prove that l is also a right identity, i.e., for all x in S, x * l = x.\n\nNow, the original question asks \"Under what conditions is an identity element necessarily two-sided?\" and \"Under what conditions is an inverse necessarily two-sided?\" The user's own theorems and conjectures address these. So the formatted problems should capture these three scenarios.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction only includes one problem. However, the original question here has multiple parts. So maybe each part should be a separate problem.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want each part structured as a separate problem. Let me check the example again. The example had one problem. Here, the original question has two main questions (identity and inverses) and the user's conjecture.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to structure the problem as per the given format. The example had one problem with its assumptions. Since the original question here is asking two questions (identity and inverses) and the user adds a conjecture, perhaps each of these can be separate problems. However, the user's example only had one problem, so maybe we should structure each as a separate entry.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"the problem\" (singular). However, the original post has multiple questions, so maybe we need to structure each as a separate problem. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user's original question is:\n\n\"I am wondering about one-sided verses two-sided. Under what conditions is an identity element necessarily two-sided? Under what conditions is an inverse necessarily two-sided? And what are the simplest proofs for these?\"\n\nSo two main questions: conditions for identity to be two-sided, conditions for inverse to be two-sided. Then the user provides some theorems they have so far and a conjecture.\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem as per the format, maybe split into two problems:\n\nFirst problem (identity):\n\nAssumptions: \n- M is a magma.\n- M has a left identity element l.\n- M has a right identity element r.\n\nProblem: Prove that l = r.\n\nSecond problem (inverses):\n\nAssumptions:\n- M is a monoid (associative with two-sided identity e).\n- For every element x in M, there exists a left inverse y (y * x = e).\n\nProblem: Prove that every left inverse is also a right inverse.\n\nThird problem (conjecture):\n\nAssumptions:\n- S is a semigroup (associative magma).\n- S has a left identity element l.\n\nProblem: Prove that l is a two-sided identity.\n\nBut the user's original question is asking under what conditions these hold, so maybe the problem statements should be phrased as questions. But in the example, the problem was phrased as a statement: \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo perhaps the problems should be:\n\nProblem 1: Prove that if a magma has both a left identity and a right identity, then they are equal.\n\nProblem 2: Prove that in a monoid, if every element has a left inverse, then every left inverse is also a right inverse.\n\nProblem 3: Prove that in a semigroup with a left identity, the left identity is a two-sided identity.\n\nBut the user's original question is asking \"Under what conditions...\", so maybe the problem statements should be:\n\nProblem 1: Under what conditions is an identity element necessarily two-sided? Prove that if a magma has both a left identity and a right identity, then they coincide.\n\nProblem 2: Under what conditions is an inverse necessarily two-sided? Prove that in a monoid with left inverses, every left inverse is a right inverse.\n\nBut since the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\", perhaps each main question is a separate problem with their own assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the example merged the problem into one, maybe here the user wants each separate theorem as a problem. Since the user provided three theorems/conjectures, but the original question has two main questions. However, the user's answer needs to filter unrelated info and structure as per the format.\n\nLooking back at the original problem, the user wrote:\n\n\"Theorems I have so far: A magma may have multiple distinct left-identities or multiple distinct right-identities, but can never have a distinct left and right identity. [Proof...] Associativity plus the existence of a two-sided inverse is enough to imply that any inverse is two-sided. [Proof...] I have a feeling that an associative magma cannot have one-sided identities - but I cannot prove this.\"\n\nSo the user has already proven that left and right identities in a magma must coincide, and that in a monoid with left inverses, inverses are two-sided. But their conjecture is that in a semigroup (associative magma) with a left identity, it must be two-sided.\n\nTherefore, the three problems they are considering are:\n\n1. In a magma, if there exist a left identity and a right identity, then they are equal. (Proven)\n\n2. In a monoid (associative with identity), if every element has a left inverse, then left inverses are right inverses. (Proven)\n\n3. In a semigroup (associative magma) with a left identity, the left identity is a right identity. (Conjecture)\n\nTherefore, the formatted problems for each would be:\n\nFor problem 1:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a magma.\n- There exists an element l in M such that for all x in M, l * x = x.\n- There exists an element r in M such that for all x in M, x * r = x.\n\nProblem: Prove that l = r.\n\nFor problem 2:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a monoid (associative magma with two-sided identity element e).\n- For every element x in M, there exists an element y in M such that y * x = e.\n\nProblem: Prove that for every x in M, x * y = e.\n\nFor problem 3:\n\nAssumption:\n- S is a semigroup (associative magma).\n- There exists an element l in S such that for all x in S, l * x = x.\n\nProblem: Prove that for all x in S, x * l = x.\n\nTherefore, these are the three separate problems extracted from the original question. However, the user might want each problem in its own formatted block. But the example given by the user had a single problem. So perhaps each of these should be presented separately.\n\nHowever, the user's instructions specify that when answering, I should follow the format, which includes one Assumption section and one Problem per formatted block. Since the original question contains multiple sub-questions, perhaps each should be formatted individually.\n\nBut the user's example only formatted one problem. So maybe the answer should be three separate formatted blocks, each addressing one of the problems.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem is structured separately. Hence, for each sub-question in the original post, create a formatted entry.\n\nBut the original question is asking two main questions (identity and inverses) and the conjecture is a third problem. So three formatted blocks.\n\nHowever, the user might prefer that we structure the entire original question into one formatted problem. But since the example had one problem, but the original here has multiple, perhaps each is a separate entry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main focus is on the conjecture, but the user's original question covers all three.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where the original problem had one question and it was formatted into one, perhaps here each theorem/conjecture is a separate problem.\n\nBut to comply with the user's example, let's see:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, but the user had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's incorrect. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. However, perhaps this was a mistake in the example. Because 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem actually requires n to be such that divisibility holds, but the user example might have been a typo. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had an unstated assumption, but according to the given example, the user restructured the problem by adding an assumption not present in the original. But that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the assumption was part of the problem but not explicitly stated, but the user extracted the necessary assumptions. However, in that case, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so there are no restrictions on n. Therefore, the example might have an error. But regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated info, and structure the problem with assumptions and problem statement.\n\nIn the current case, the Math Stack Exchange question is a bit broad, asking for conditions under which identities and inverses are two-sided. The user has provided some theorems and a conjecture, so we need to extract each of these as separate problems.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer would have three parts, each with their own Assumption and Problem sections. However, the user's example only has one. Maybe the user wants each sub-problem as a separate entry. So the answer would be three formatted blocks.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the assistant must follow the format which starts with ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT### and includes Assumption and Problem. So if the original question has multiple problems, each should be formatted accordingly.\n\nThus, the final answer should be three separate formatted blocks for each of the three problems identified.",
