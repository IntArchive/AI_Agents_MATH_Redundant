    "Content": "Given that $R$ is a ring with no non-zero nilpotent elements and has $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ for all $a,b\\in R$, show that $R$ is commutative. I have previously shown that, if $R$ is unital and has $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ for all $a,b\\in R$, then $R$ is commutative. This allows me to restrict attention to non-unital $R$, but I haven't been able to get anywhere with that \"simplification\". The proof in the unital case makes explicit use of the unit element, and it does not seem to suggest anything for this new case. Some of the things I've tried: various element manipulations; looking for some sort of recurrence between powers of a commutator $ab-ba$; studying the set $S=\\{(ab-ba)^k\\mid k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$. This is from Herstein's Topics in Algebra, second edition, problem #25 in the supplementary problems of chapter 3. Any hints would be appreciated. Edit: proof in the unital case If $R$ is unital, evaluate $[a(1+b)]^2$ in two different ways, using the stipulation of the problem, to find $a^2b=aba$. Similarly, $[(1+a)b]^2$ gives $ab^2=bab$. Finally, evaluating $[(1+a)(1+b)]^2$ in two different ways, and canceling terms using those two relations, we end up with $ab=ba$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Martin Brandenburg asked in a comment how one might come up with the proof in the paper linked by YACP and transcribed in Jonathan's answer; I'll try to answer that here by showing the train of thought that led me to the same (as far as I can see) proof.  When I thought about it, I had see the \"edit\" of the question, using $1+b$ in place of $b$ in the unital case, and, as you'll see, that contributed to my approach. First, notice that the given equation $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ asserts a sort of commutativity, since the left side $abab$ and the right side $aabb$ differ only in the order of a pair of $a,b$ factors.  The equation can be rewritten to emphasize this observation: $a(ba-ab)b=0$ or, reversing the sign $a(ab-ba)b=0$.  So the commutator $ab-ba$ is killed when sandwiched between $a$ and $b$.  Also when  sandwiched between $b$ and $a$ (see the equation before I reversed the sign, and switch the roles of $a$ and $b$). The next idea is to try to push this idea of killer sandwiches further.  If I could express the same commutator $ab-ba$ as the commutator of some other two elements, then those elements would also kill it in a sandwich.  Here the $1+b$ idea surfaced.  The commutator of $a$ and $1+b$ is the same as that of $a$ and $b$, because $1$ commutes with $a$.  Unfortunately, we don't have a unity element $1$ in our ring.  But we do have some other things that commute with $a$ and therefore might be used instead of $1$ here.  The simplest of these is $a$ itself.  So the commutator of $a$ and $b$ is also the commutator of $a$ and $a+b$ and is therefore killed when sandwiched by $a$ and $a+b$. But if you write down the two equations saying that $ab-ba$ is killed when sandwiched by $a,b$ and also when sandwiched by $a$ and $a+b$, and if you subtract the first of these equations from the second, you get that $ab-ba$ is killed when sandwiched by $a$ and $a$.  Symmetrically or similarly, it's also killed when sandwiched by $b$ and $b$. These results combine to say that $ab-ba$ is killed when sandwiched by any two (non-commutative) polynomials in $a$ and $b$ as long as these have no constant terms.  In particular, it is killed when sandwiched by itself and itself.  That means its cube is zero.  But we're given that there are no non-zero nilpotents in our ring, so the commutator itself has to be zero. I hope that, at least by using more words and fewer complicated equations, I've given an idea how a more-or-less reasonable human being might arrive at this proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the original problem: The ring R has no non-zero nilpotent elements and satisfies (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 for all a, b in R. The goal is to show R is commutative. \n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states two main properties: R has no non-zero nilpotents, and for all a, b in R, (ab)^2 equals a^2b^2. Each of these should be separate assumptions. Also, R is a ring, which is an assumption but maybe implicit here. The user mentioned that in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, we need to list each condition as separate lines.\n\nAssumptions would be:\n- R is a ring.\n- R has no non-zero nilpotent elements.\n- For all a, b in R, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2.\n\nThe problem statement is to show R is commutative.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, they mentioned that in the unital case, they already proved commutativity. Now the focus is on non-unital rings. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify whether R is unital or not. The user's question says they considered restricting to non-unital R but didn't get progress. However, the problem as given in Herstein is just the general case, perhaps without assuming a unit. So the original problem doesn't assume R has a unit. Therefore, the assumptions should not include being unital. The user's own approach considered splitting into unital and non-unital cases, but the problem itself just states R is a ring with those two properties.\n\nHence, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the three I listed above. The problem is to show R is commutative. The original problem's title already states these conditions, so the answer should extract those as the assumptions.\n\nAnother thing to check: the example given by the user included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, the problem statement is \"Given that R is a ring with no non-zero nilpotent elements and has (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 for all a, b in R, show that R is commutative.\" So the two main conditions are the nilpotent-free and the identity on squares. Each should be a separate assumption. Also, the fact that R is a ring is an assumption. Wait, in the example, they didn't state \"n is an integer\" as a separate assumption, but in reality, the problem states \"for every integer n\". So perhaps \"n is an integer\" is an assumption. Similarly, here, \"R is a ring\" is part of the problem's given, so that's an assumption. So maybe three assumptions here:\n\n1. R is a ring.\n2. R has no non-zero nilpotent elements.\n3. For all a, b in R, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2.\n\nBut maybe the problem in Herstein already assumes R is a ring, so the user didn't mention that. Wait, the original problem on Math Stack Exchange says \"Given that R is a ring with no non-zero nilpotent elements and has (ab)^2=a^2b^2 for all a,b∈R, show that R is commutative.\" So yes, R is a ring is part of the problem's given. So the assumptions are R is a ring, R has no non-zero nilpotents, and (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 for all a, b.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to show R is commutative.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each assumption on separate lines and then the problem statement.",
