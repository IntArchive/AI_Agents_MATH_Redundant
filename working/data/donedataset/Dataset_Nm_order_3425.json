    "AcceptedAnswer": "Method 1 Integrate once by parts to get\n$$\\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{b\\sin bx-a\\sin ax}{x}dx$$\nand then use Dirichlet integral $\\displaystyle \\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin x}{x}dx=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Method 2 (contour integration): Using parity, write the integral as $\\displaystyle\\frac12\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}$ and then deform the contour to be the line $C$ slightly below the real axis. Next express cosines in terms of exponentials. Then we obtain\n$$I=\\frac14\\left(\\int_C \\frac{e^{iax}dx}{x^2}+\\int_C \\frac{e^{-iax}dx}{x^2}-\\int_C \\frac{e^{ibx}dx}{x^2}-\\int_C \\frac{e^{-ibx}dx}{x^2}\\right)$$ For $a,b>0$, in the integrals containing $e^{-iax}$, $e^{-ibx}$, the contour can be closed in the lower half plane (by Jordan lemma) and therefore these integrals vanish (as there are no singularities inside). The integrals containing $e^{iax}$, $e^{ibx}$ can only be closed in the upper half plane and are therefore given by the residues at $x=0$:\n$$I=\\frac{\\pi i}{2}\\left(\\mathrm{res}_{x=0}\\frac{e^{iax}}{x^2}-\\mathrm{res}_{x=0}\\frac{e^{ibx}}{x^2}\\right) =\\frac{\\pi i}{2}\\left(ia-ib\\right)=\\frac{\\pi(b-a)}{2}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that the integral from 0 to infinity of (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x² dx equals π times (b - a)/2 when a and b are non-negative. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to infinity, so the limits are part of the problem statement. The integrand is (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x². The variables a and b are given as non-negative (a,b ≥ 0). The problem statement also mentions using contour integrals for the solution, but that's more of a method request rather than an assumption. The user wants different solutions, but again, that's about the approach, not the problem's conditions.\n\nSo the assumptions should be: a is a non-negative real number, b is a non-negative real number, the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is the difference of cosines divided by x squared. Each of these should be separate points. The problem statement is to prove the integral equals π(b - a)/2. Wait, the original problem in the example had an incorrect assumption about n being divisible by 7, but that was part of the example's correction. Here, the key is to list all given conditions. Let me check again. The user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait no, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Or perhaps the user intended to modify the problem? Hmm. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Maybe the example was a bad one. But regardless, for the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the given format.\n\nSo for the integral problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is a non-negative real number.\n2. b is a non-negative real number.\n3. The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n4. The integrand is (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x².\n\nThe problem is to show that this integral equals π(b - a)/2.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote the answer as π*(b - a)/2. Let me check the LaTeX. The user wrote \"pi frac {b-a} {2}\" which would be π*(b - a)/2. So that's correct.\n\nSo structuring this, the assumptions should list each condition. Each assumption is a single property for one object. So a and b each being non-negative are separate. The integral's limits and the integrand form are also separate. However, the integrand's structure might be considered as one assumption. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", which are separate. But in the current problem, the integrand is given, so maybe the integrand's form is an assumption. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- a is a non-negative real number.\n- b is a non-negative real number.\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x².\n\nThen the problem is to show that this integral equals π(b - a)/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement already includes the integrand and limits, so perhaps the integrand and limits are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So the example's formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original, which seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants us to follow it regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me look again. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That's a mistake because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So the example might be incorrect. But perhaps the user intended that in the formatted problem, they listed the assumptions that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but that's conflicting. Maybe the original problem had a typo? Hmm. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to follow the instruction, which is to list all the assumptions of the problem as per the given format.\n\nIn the current integral problem, the original problem states \"for a,b ≥ 0\". So the assumptions are that a and b are non-negative. The integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is given. So each of these is part of the problem's conditions. Therefore, in the assumptions, I should list:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- a is a non-negative real number.\n- b is a non-negative real number.\n- The integral is taken from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is (cos(ax) - cos(bx))/x².\n\nBut wait, the problem statement is to show the integral equals π(b - a)/2. So maybe the integrand and the limits are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. However, the example included the structure of A(n) as part of the problem statement. Let me check the example again. The example's problem was \"Prove that $$A(n) = 5^n ...$$ is divisible by 91.\" So the structure of A(n) is part of the problem statement. Therefore, in the current problem, the integral expression is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a non-negative real number.\n- b is a non-negative real number.\n\nThe rest is part of the problem statement. The integral from 0 to infinity and the integrand are given in the problem. So the assumptions are just the conditions on a and b. Because the problem is to show that for a,b ≥ 0, the integral equals that value. So the key assumptions are a and b being non-negative. The integral and its integrand are part of what's given in the problem to prove.\n\nSo the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- a is a non-negative real number.\n- b is a non-negative real number.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that $$\\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\frac {\\cos (ax) -\\cos (bx)} {x^2}dx=\\pi \\frac {b-a} {2}$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem also says \"for a,b ≥ 0\", so those are the assumptions. The rest is part of the problem. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are a and b being non-negative, each as a separate line. The integral expression is part of the problem statement.",
