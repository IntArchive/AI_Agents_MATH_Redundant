    "Content": "Prove that $f=x^4-4x^2+16\\in\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is irreducible. I am trying to prove it with Eisenstein's criterion but without success: for p=2 , it divides -4 and the constant coefficient 16, don't divide the leading coeficient 1, but its square 4 divides the constant coefficient 16, so doesn't work. Therefore I tried to find $f(x\\pm c)$ which is irreducible: $f(x+1)=x^4+4x^3+2x^2-4x+13$ , but 13 has the divisors: 1 and 13 , so don't exist a prime number p such that to apply the first condition: $p|a_i, i\\ne n$ ; the same problem for $f(x-1)=x^4+...+13$ For $f(x+2)=x^4+8x^3+20x^2+16x+16$ is the same problem from where we go, if we set p=2 , that means $2|8, 2|20, 2|16$ , not divide the leading coefficient 1, but its square 4 divide the constant coefficient 16; again, doesn't work.. is same problem for x-2 Now I'll verify for $f(x\\pm3)$ , but I think it will be fall... I think if I verify all constant $f(x\\pm c)$ it doesn't work with this method...  so have any idea how we can prove that $f$ is irreducible?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The associated quadratic polynomial $t^2-4t+16$ has negative discriminant, so there's no real root. Then the polynomial can be factorized over the reals as a product of degree two polynomial. You get them by a process similar to completing the square:\n\\begin{align}\nx^4-4x^2+16\n&=x^4+8x^2+16-12x^2\\\\\n&=(x^2+4)^2-(\\sqrt{12}\\,x)^2\\\\\n&=(x^2-\\sqrt{12}\\,x+4)(x^2+\\sqrt{12}\\,x+4)\n\\end{align}\nThese two polynomials have negative discriminant (no need to verify it) and so they're irreducible in $\\mathbb{R}[x]$. If the given polynomial were reducible over the rationals, the two factorizations in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and $\\mathbb{R}[x]$ would coincide. Therefore the given polynomial is irreducible over the rationals. What's the general rule? Suppose you have $x^4+px^2+q$, with $p,q$ integers and $p^2-4q<0$ (so $q>0$). Write $q=r^2$, with $r>0$ (it need not be integer), and\n$$\nx^4+px^2+q=x^4+2rx^2+r^2-(2r-p)x^2\n$$\nNote that $2r-p>0$: it's obvious if $p<0$; if $p\\ge0$ it's the same as $4q>p^2$, which is true by hypothesis. Then\n$$\nx^4+px^2+q=(x^2-\\sqrt{2r-p}\\,x+r)(x^2+\\sqrt{2r-p}\\,x+r)\n$$\nis the decomposition of the polynomial in $\\mathbb{R}[x]$. It is in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ if and only if $\\sqrt{q}$ and $\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{q}-p}$ are integers. For example, $q=4$ and $p=0$ is a case. For $q=16$ we need $8-p$ to be a square, so $q=16$ and $p=4$ is another case.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the polynomial f = x^4 -4x^2 +16 is irreducible over the rationals. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem statement mentions f is in Q[x], so that's one assumption. The user tried Eisenstein's criterion with p=2 but it didn't work because 2 divides -4 and 16, but 2^2 divides 16. Then they tried shifting the polynomial by various constants (x±1, x±2) but Eisenstein still didn't apply. The problem is to prove irreducibility, but the user is stuck because their methods aren't working.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n- The polynomial f is in Q[x].\n- Eisenstein's criterion with p=2 doesn't apply because 2 divides coefficients but 4 divides the constant term.\n- Shifting f by ±1, ±2 also doesn't satisfy Eisenstein's conditions.\nWait, but in the example given, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is about the polynomial, and the user's attempts. But according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions. The example included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. \n\nBut in this problem, the main assumptions are the properties of the polynomial and the failed attempts. But perhaps the key assumptions are that f is the given quartic polynomial, and maybe that the coefficients are rational. But the user tried Eisenstein with p=2 and shifts, which didn't work. However, the problem itself is to prove irreducibility, so perhaps the assumptions are just that f is defined as x^4 -4x^2 +16 in Q[x]. The user's attempts are part of the problem's context but not assumptions. The example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, maybe that's part of the problem's given conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake? Or maybe the user in that case had additional constraints. Wait, the original example says the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would mean the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, which is a different problem. So maybe the example was wrong, but according to that, the assistant is supposed to extract the assumptions from the problem statement. But in the current problem, the user is asking to prove that f is irreducible over Q, and their attempts using Eisenstein and shifting didn't work. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- f = x^4 -4x^2 +16 is a polynomial in Q[x].\n- The user attempted Eisenstein's criterion with p=2 but failed because 2 divides coefficients and 4 divides the constant term.\n- Shifting f by ±1, ±2 also didn't meet Eisenstein's conditions.\n\nBut according to the format, the assumptions should list the problem's conditions. The problem is to prove irreducibility of f over Q. The user's attempts are part of the problem's context but perhaps not the assumptions. Wait, the example included assumptions from the problem statement. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, it lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the assistant in the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which might be a mistake. But following the example, perhaps here the assumptions should include that the polynomial is in Q[x], and maybe that Eisenstein's criterion with p=2 and shifts didn't work. But the problem's actual assumptions are just that f is given as x^4 -4x^2 +16 in Q[x]. The rest are the user's attempts. Therefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: f = x^4 -4x^2 +16 is a polynomial in Q[x].\n\nBut the user tried Eisenstein with p=2 and shifting, but those are part of the problem's context. However, according to the example, the assumption might include the conditions that make the problem non-trivial, such as Eisenstein not being directly applicable. Wait, in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it. That seems incorrect. Wait, the original example's problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption says n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That might be an error. However, perhaps the user intended that the example shows filtering unrelated information. For instance, in the original problem, maybe the user mentioned some conditions, but the assistant extracted the key assumptions. But in the current problem, the key assumption is that f is in Q[x], and the problem is to prove it's irreducible. The user's attempts are part of the problem's description but not assumptions. So perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption: f = x^4 -4x^2 +16 is in Q[x].\n\nProblem: Prove that f is irreducible over Q.\n\nBut the user tried Eisenstein and shifts, which didn't work, but those are part of the problem's context. However, according to the example, maybe the assistant should include the failed attempts as assumptions. But in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps that example was incorrect, and the current problem's assumptions are just the polynomial's definition. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should list all given conditions. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: Prove that f=x^4-4x^2+16∈ℚ[x] is irreducible. The user tried Eisenstein with p=2 but failed because p divides coefficients and p² divides constant term. Tried shifting x by ±1, ±2, but same issue. Asks for another method.\n\nSo the problem is to prove irreducibility of f over ℚ. The assumptions are that f is given as x^4 -4x^2 +16 in ℚ[x], and perhaps that Eisenstein's criterion doesn't apply directly or via shifts. But in terms of the problem's assumptions, it's just that f is in ℚ[x]. The rest are the user's attempts. So the formatted problem should list the key assumption: f is in ℚ[x]. The problem is to prove it's irreducible. So:\n\nAssumption: f = x^4 -4x^2 +16 is in ℚ[x].\n\nProblem: Prove that f is irreducible.\n\nBut the example included more assumptions. Wait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. The original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. That suggests that maybe the assistant in the example made a mistake, but following that example, perhaps here we should include additional assumptions from the problem's context. However, in the current problem, the user's attempts show that Eisenstein doesn't work, but that's part of the problem's context. However, according to the instructions, the assistant should \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n- f is the polynomial x^4 -4x^2 +16 in ℚ[x].\n- Eisenstein's criterion with p=2 is not applicable because 2 divides coefficients but 4 divides 16.\n- Shifting the polynomial by ±1, ±2 also doesn't satisfy Eisenstein's conditions.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove irreducibility regardless of these attempts. However, according to the example, the assistant should list assumptions that are part of the problem's conditions, not the user's attempts. The user's attempts are part of the question but not the problem's inherent assumptions. So perhaps the only assumption is that f is in ℚ[x]. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: f = x^4 -4x^2 +16 is in ℚ[x].\n\nProblem: Prove that f is irreducible.\n\nBut maybe the user's mention of Eisenstein not working is part of the problem's conditions. For example, maybe the problem is to prove irreducibility even though Eisenstein doesn't apply. But in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it. That seems like an error. However, perhaps the user wants to include all given conditions as assumptions. The original problem states f is in ℚ[x], which is the main assumption. The user's attempts are part of the problem's context but not assumptions. So the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption: f = x^4 -4x^2 +16 is in ℚ[x].\n\nProblem: Prove that f is irreducible over ℚ.\n\nThat's concise. The user's attempts with Eisenstein and shifting are part of their approach but not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should include only the essential assumption and the problem statement.",
