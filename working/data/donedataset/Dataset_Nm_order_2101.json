    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to read the original problem carefully.\n\nThe original problem is about evaluating an improper integral involving a logarithm and an absolute value: ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx. The user claims that this integral equals (π/2) log(tanh 1), and they want to show this. \n\nNow, I need to filter out the assumptions from the problem. The example given earlier shows that assumptions are conditions applied to one object each. The original problem mentions that the integral converges because log |tan x| can be rewritten as (1/2) log(tan²x), and near the singularities at x = nπ/2, the integrand behaves like 2(-1)^n log(x - nπ/2), which is integrable. However, these are part of the user's reasoning, not explicit assumptions given in the problem statement itself.\n\nThe problem as posed doesn't list explicit conditions other than the integral from 0 to infinity of the given function. The integrand has singularities at x = nπ/2, so the integral is improper at those points. However, the user's explanation about the convergence might be part of their solution steps, but in the example provided, assumptions were taken from the original problem statement, not from the user's added reasoning. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem mentioned that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, looking back at the example: Original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps that example was a mistake. But in the current problem, I have to follow the user's instruction.\n\nWait, the user provided an example where the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error because the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps in that example, maybe there was a miscommunication. However, the user's instruction says \"filtered the unrelated informations\", so maybe in that case, they considered that the original problem had an error, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to show that the integral equals (π/2) log(tanh 1). The original problem's title and question don't list any explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. However, the user's own explanation mentions the behavior near the singularities, but those are part of their reasoning. So for the assumptions, I need to extract any conditions given in the problem. The integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is log |tan x| divided by (1 + x²). The integral is improper because tan x has singularities at x = (n + 1/2)π for integer n, so the integral needs to be interpreted as a sum of integrals over intervals between these singularities. Therefore, the integral is an improper integral of the second kind at each singularity. The problem might assume that the integral converges, but the user is asking to show the value, so perhaps the main assumption is the convergence. However, in the example, the assumption included conditions on n. Here, maybe the key assumptions are about the convergence of the integral at the singular points and at infinity.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they extracted \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" from the original problem. But in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem then included assumptions that n is integer and n is divisible by 7, which contradicts the original problem's statement. Therefore, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the example was structured differently. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example had a different context. Hmm. This is confusing. \n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem sections. The original problem on Math Stack Exchange is: \n\nTitle: Improper integral with log and absolute value: ∫₀^∞ log |tan x| / (1 + x²) dx\n\nQuestion: How do you show that ∫₀^∞ log |tan x| / (1 + x²) dx = (π/2) log(tanh 1)? They mention that the integral converges because log |tan x| = (1/2) log(tan²x), and near x = nπ/2, it behaves like 2(-1)^n log(x - nπ/2), so the singularities are integrable.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were taken from the original problem's conditions. In the current problem, the original problem doesn't state any explicit conditions beyond the integral from 0 to infinity. However, the integral's integrand has singularities at x = (n + 1/2)π for integers n ≥ 0. Therefore, the integral is improper at each of these points and also as x approaches infinity. The problem assumes that the integral converges, which the user justifies in their explanation. However, in the problem statement, they are asking to evaluate the integral, implying that it converges. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral converges. But according to the user's example, perhaps we need to list the conditions that make the integral convergent as separate assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the variable is x, integrated from 0 to infinity. The integrand's singularities at x = (n + 1/2)π. So the integral is a sum of integrals from (nπ - π/2) to (nπ + π/2), but since the original integral is from 0 to infinity, it would be integrating over intervals where tan x is defined, but tan x has vertical asymptotes at (n + 1/2)π. Therefore, the integral must be split at each of these points, and the convergence at each singularity must be addressed.\n\nHowever, the problem statement itself doesn't list these as assumptions; the user is just asked to show the integral equals that value. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral converges, which is given by the user's own note. However, in the problem formatting instructions, the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem. Since the problem is to compute the integral, and the user mentions that the integral converges (due to the behavior near singularities), maybe that's part of the problem's assumptions. Alternatively, since the problem is to compute the integral, the main assumption is that the integral exists (i.e., converges), and possibly that the integrand is as defined.\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't explicitly list assumptions; it just presents the integral. Therefore, perhaps the assumption section here is minimal. Let's look again at the example: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which becomes an assumption. Here, the problem is an integral from 0 to infinity, so the assumption is that x is a real number in [0, ∞). However, in the problem statement, the integral is over x from 0 to infinity, so the variable x is integrated over that interval. The integrand has log |tan x|, which is defined except at x = (n + 1/2)π. Therefore, the integral is improper at each of those points. So the assumptions might include that the integral converges at each of these singularities and at infinity. But the problem statement doesn't state these; they are part of the integral's properties. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that the integral is taken in the principal value sense, but that's not mentioned. The user's own explanation mentions that the singularities are integrable, so perhaps that's part of their reasoning but not an assumption given in the problem. \n\nGiven the example provided by the user, even if the original problem didn't state certain conditions, they were extracted as assumptions. For example, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. Then, in the formatted problem, another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added, which seems to come from the fact that 91 is 7×13, so perhaps the example was modified to include that. But that's confusing. Perhaps in the example, the original problem had an error or the formatting was incorrect. However, for the current problem, I need to list the assumptions as per the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to compute the integral from 0 to infinity of (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx. The only explicit condition is the integral's bounds. The integrand involves log |tan x|, which is defined except at points where tan x = 0 or undefined. But tan x is 0 at x = nπ, and undefined at x = (n + 1/2)π. However, |tan x| is |sin x / cos x|, so log |tan x| is log |sin x| - log |cos x|. The singularities occur where either sin x or cos x is zero, which are at x = nπ and x = (n + 1/2)π. But near x = nπ, tan x approaches 0, so log |tan x| approaches -infty, but the integral's behavior there needs to be checked. Similarly, near x = (n + 1/2)π, tan x approaches ±infty, so log |tan x| approaches +infty. Therefore, the integral has singularities at both x = nπ and x = (n + 1/2)π. However, the user's explanation mentions singularities at x = nπ/2, which are the points where tan x is 0 or undefined. So x = nπ/2 includes both x = kπ (even n) and x = (k + 1/2)π (odd n). Therefore, the integral is improper at each x = nπ/2 for integer n ≥ 0.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly list assumptions; it's just asking to evaluate the integral. Therefore, the only assumption I can list is that the integral converges. However, in the user's example, assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, since the integral is over x from 0 to infinity, perhaps the assumptions are about x being a real number in that interval, and that the integral is improper at the singularities. But how to phrase that?\n\nWait, in the example, assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the variable x is integrated over, so perhaps there are no assumptions on x beyond it being in the domain of integration. But the problem is to compute the integral, so the main assumption is that the integral exists (converges). However, the problem statement includes the integral, so the integral's existence is part of what needs to be shown, but the user's question is to compute its value. Therefore, perhaps the assumption here is that the integral converges, which is mentioned in the problem's body. The user says, \"I know that the integral converges since...\" So the problem itself assumes convergence. Therefore, the assumption would be that the integral converges. However, in the example, the assumption was about the variable's properties (n being integer, etc.), but here, the convergence is a property of the integral, not of the variable x. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions under which the integral is convergent. For example, the integrand's behavior near the singularities is integrable. But the user's explanation mentions that the singularities are integrable, which justifies convergence. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx converges.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are properties applied to one object. In the example, each assumption was about n. Here, perhaps the assumption is about the integral's convergence. But since the problem is to evaluate the integral, perhaps the main assumption is that the integral exists (converges). \n\nAlternatively, the problem might not state any assumptions beyond the integral's setup, so the formatted problem's assumption section is empty. But the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them explicitly. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's conflicting because if n is any integer, the divisibility by 7 isn't required. Therefore, perhaps there was an error in the example. Maybe the original problem in the example had a different condition. \n\nGiven this confusion, but needing to proceed, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx converges.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they extracted conditions on the variable (n being integer), which in this case, the variable x is real and integrated from 0 to ∞. Alternatively, the problem may not require any explicit assumptions beyond the integral being defined as an improper integral. \n\nAnother angle: in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13. The user formatted assumptions as n being integer and divisible by 7. However, the original problem's statement was for every integer n. This suggests that perhaps the example was incorrectly formatted, and the assumption should only be that n is an integer. The additional assumption of divisibility by 7 may have been a mistake. \n\nAssuming that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are minimal. The problem is to compute the integral, and the only assumption is that the integral is taken over x from 0 to ∞, and that log |tan x| is defined except at the singularities. But since the problem is stated as is, the formatted assumptions might not need to list anything beyond the integral's setup. However, according to the user's example, even if the original problem didn't list assumptions, they extracted them from the problem's context. In this case, the integral is improper, so perhaps the assumption is that the integral converges, which the user mentions in their explanation. \n\nBut to adhere to the user's example, where assumptions were listed even if not explicitly stated (like n being an integer), perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The integral converges.\n\nBut since the integral is from 0 to ∞, x is in [0, ∞). However, the problem is about the integral, not about x. Alternatively, the problem's assumptions could be that the singularities at x = nπ/2 are integrable, ensuring convergence. But the problem statement doesn't state this; the user's explanation does. \n\nIn the problem statement, the user writes: \"How do you show that [integral] = ...?\" The problem as posed doesn't list any assumptions; it's just the integral. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the problem statement as is, and the assumptions might be empty. But according to the user's example, assumptions were extracted even from the problem's conditions. For example, \"for every integer n\" becomes an assumption. Here, the problem is over x from 0 to ∞, which is an assumption about the variable x. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number in the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx is an improper integral.\n\nBut these are inherent to the problem's setup. Alternatively, since the problem involves log |tan x|, which has singularities, the assumption could be that the integral is interpreted as an improper Riemann integral at each singularity. \n\nHowever, to adhere to the example's structure, where each assumption is about one object, here the main objects are x and the integral. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx converges.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx = (π/2) log(tanh 1).\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions were about the variables or conditions in the problem. In this case, since the integral's convergence is mentioned in the problem's body by the user, perhaps the assumption is that the integral converges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any assumptions beyond the integral's definition, and the user's note about convergence is part of their solution. Therefore, the formatted problem would have no assumptions, but according to the user's example, they included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's original statement. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example, perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx converges.\n\nBut since the example included an assumption that n is an integer, which was part of the problem's original statement, here the original problem's statement is about the integral from 0 to infinity, so the assumption is that x is in [0, ∞). But this is redundant since the integral's limits define x's domain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions beyond what's stated, and the formatted problem's assumption section is empty. But the user's example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem's original conditions. \n\nGiven the confusion, but to follow the user's example, perhaps the assumption here is that the integral converges. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx converges.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx = (π/2) log(tanh 1).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was more granular, listing properties applied to one object each. Here, the integral's convergence is a single assumption. However, according to the user's example, they split the assumptions into separate lines. For instance, in the example, two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the integral's convergence is one assumption. Alternatively, breaking down the convergence into parts: convergence at each singularity and at infinity. But the user's problem statement doesn't specify that; it's part of their explanation. Therefore, to stick strictly to the problem statement, the only assumption is the integral's existence, but since the problem is to show its value, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's definition. \n\nWait, the user's example formatted the problem as:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem was to prove it for every integer n, which contradicts the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Therefore, perhaps the example was incorrect. However, given that, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the user wants to show its value. The problem's assumptions, if any, would be about the convergence of the integral. However, since the problem asks to show the integral equals a certain value, the convergence is part of what needs to be established. But in the example, the formatted problem included assumptions that were part of the original problem's statement. Therefore, if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", that becomes an assumption. Here, the original problem is to compute the integral, so perhaps the assumption is that the integral converges. \n\nBut given the confusion in the example, I'll proceed by listing the integral's convergence as an assumption, even if it's part of what needs to be shown. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has no explicit assumptions, and the formatted problem's assumption section is empty. However, according to the user's example, even if the problem statement includes a condition like \"for every integer n\", it's listed as an assumption. Therefore, here, since the problem is to compute the integral from 0 to infinity, the assumption would be that x is a real number in [0, ∞), but that's inherent in the integral's limits. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions, and the formatted problem's assumption section is empty. However, the user's example shows that assumptions are extracted even when part of the problem's original statement. Therefore, I'll proceed to list the integral's convergence as an assumption, even though it's part of the problem's requirements. \n\nFinal decision:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx converges.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ∫₀^∞ (log |tan x|)/(1 + x²) dx = (π/2) log(tanh 1).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes convergence and the task is to compute it, then that's the structure. However, the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's variables, like n being an integer, which was stated in the original problem. Here, the problem doesn't state any explicit assumptions about x, so maybe there are no assumptions to list, which contradicts the example. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but to adhere to the example's structure where assumptions were listed even when part of the problem's original statement, I'll list the integral's convergence as an assumption.",
