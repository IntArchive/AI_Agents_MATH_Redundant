    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me tackle this problem. First, I need to parse the original question and structure it according to the specified format. The user wants me to list each assumption line by line, ensuring each addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the problem from Math Stack Exchange, the user provided an integral involving parameters α and β defined in terms of a and b. The goal is to prove that the integral equals log(a)log(b). They also mentioned deriving it in a roundabout way and are looking for a clearer proof, but for the purpose of this task, I just need to structure the problem as per the format.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the assumptions. The problem defines α and β in terms of a and b. Each of these definitions is a separate assumption. Also, the integral has specific limits (from 0 to 1), the integrand involves inverse hyperbolic tangent (tanh⁻¹) of βt, and the denominator includes t multiplied by the square root of (1-t)(1-αt). Each of these components should be listed as separate assumptions. However, according to the example, assumptions should be properties or conditions applied to one object each. So, α and β are defined in terms of a and b, which are presumably positive real numbers (since log(a) and log(b) are involved). The integral's limits and the form of the integrand are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Wait, but in the example given, the original problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In the problem here, maybe the assumptions are the definitions of α and β. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption listed n as an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, there was no mention of n needing to be divisible by 7. The user's formatted problem added that assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption says \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the original problem was different? Let me check again.\n\nWait the example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that's incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. So the example seems to have a mistake. Maybe the user intended to have an example where the assumption was that n is an integer, but the problem requires divisibility by 7 and 13 (since 91=7*13). Perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to list all the assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the user defines α and β in terms of a and b. So the assumptions would be those definitions and possibly the conditions on a and b. But the original problem doesn't state any conditions on a and b, but since log(a) and log(b) are present, a and b must be positive real numbers. Also, the expressions for α and β must be such that the integral converges. For instance, the denominator in the integral's square root must be valid: (1-t)(1-αt) must be non-negative for t in [0,1]. Similarly, the argument of tanh⁻¹(βt) must be between -1 and 1. So maybe these are implicit assumptions.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't explicitly state these conditions. The user might want to list the explicit definitions given. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\nα is defined as [(ab -1)^2 + (a - b)^2]/[(ab +1)^2 + (a + b)^2],\n\nβ is defined as [(ab +1)^2 - (a + b)^2]/[(ab +1)^2 + (a + b)^2].\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So α is defined by that expression, β by another. Also, perhaps a and b are positive real numbers (to have logs defined), but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we shouldn't include that unless it's explicit. The problem says \"if we set α and β as...\", so the main assumptions are those definitions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n\nα = [(ab -1)^2 + (a - b)^2]/[(ab +1)^2 + (a + b)^2],\n\nβ = [(ab +1)^2 - (a + b)^2]/[(ab +1)^2 + (a + b)^2].\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∫₀¹ [tanh⁻¹(βt) dt]/[t√((1−t)(1−αt))] = log(a) log(b).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps we need to list the domain of variables as assumptions. But in this problem, the variables a and b are not specified. However, the result is log(a)log(b), which implies a and b are positive real numbers (since log is undefined otherwise). But the problem didn't state that. So should we include that as assumptions? The original problem didn't specify, but it's necessary for the RHS to be defined. Similarly, the integral's convergence requires certain conditions on α and β. For example, the square root in the denominator requires that (1-t)(1-αt) > 0 for t ∈ [0,1]. Since t ∈ [0,1], 1-t ≥0. So 1-αt must also be non-negative. Thus, 1-αt ≥0 for t ∈ [0,1]. The maximum of αt occurs at t=1, so α ≤1. So α must be ≤1. Similarly, the argument of tanh⁻¹(βt) must satisfy |βt| <1. Since t ∈ [0,1], this requires |β| <1.\n\nBut these conditions are not stated in the original problem. The user might have derived it under certain implicit assumptions. However, since the problem is presented as given, perhaps the only explicit assumptions are the definitions of α and β. Therefore, following the example structure, we list those two definitions as assumptions, each on their own line.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nα is defined as [(ab - 1)^2 + (a - b)^2] / [(ab + 1)^2 + (a + b)^2],\n\nβ is defined as [(ab + 1)^2 - (a + b)^2] / [(ab + 1)^2 + (a + b)^2].\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∫₀¹ [tanh⁻¹(βt) dt] / [t√((1−t)(1−αt))] = log(a) log(b).\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line. Wait, in the example, each assumption is listed line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$α = \\frac{(ab - 1)^2 + (a - b)^2}{(ab + 1)^2 + (a + b)^2}$,\n\n$β = \\frac{(ab + 1)^2 - (a + b)^2}{(ab + 1)^2 + (a + b)^2}$.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\tanh^{-1} (\\beta t) dt}{t\\sqrt{(1-t)(1- \\alpha t)}}=\\log (a) \\log (b).$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. The assumptions are the definitions of α and β. The problem is the integral equaling log(a)log(b). The original problem didn't specify conditions on a and b, so unless it's necessary for the integral to converge, which might be implicit, but the user didn't state it, so perhaps we shouldn't include those as assumptions unless specified. The example given by the user included assumptions that weren't in the original problem, like n divisible by 7, which was incorrect. But following the user's example, which might have been a mistake, but we have to follow their format. In their example, they listed assumptions that were present in the original problem. Wait, the original example's original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\", which is correct, but then added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. That seems like an error. So perhaps the user intended to extract the key conditions from the problem. In the current problem, the key conditions are the definitions of α and β. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those two definitions as assumptions. Each on their own line. The problem is to prove the integral equals log(a)log(b).\n\nAdditionally, in the original problem, the user mentioned being interested in deeper reasons or implications, but that's part of the question, not part of the problem statement. The task is to structure the problem as per the format, which includes Assumption and Problem. The rest (asking for references, etc.) is part of the original question but not needed in the formatted problem. Therefore, the final answer should list the two assumptions (definitions of α and β) and the problem statement.",
