    "Content": "How can I prove that $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{2}{n}\\right)^{\\large{(-1)^{n+1}n}} \\,= \\frac{\\pi}{2e}$$ The result is given here (result 48). The source: Prudnikov et al. 1986, p. 757 is given, however I have been unable to find the book online. Some of my attempts include : Multiplying known infinite products for $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{e}$ $$ \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{2\\cdot2\\cdot4\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot6\\cdots}{1\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdots} $$ $$ \\frac{1}{e} =  \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{\\large{\\frac{1}{4}}}\\left(\\frac{5\\cdot7}{6\\cdot8}\\right)^{\\large{\\frac{1}{4}}} \\cdots$$ as well as others given in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.2712.pdf Trying to find the partial products from ${n=1} $ to $k $ , Mathematica Gives: $$\\scriptsize{ \\frac{\\exp\\left(2\\left(-\\zeta(-1,k+\\frac{1}{2})^{(1,0)}+\\zeta(-1,k+\\frac{3}{2})^{(1,0)}+\\zeta(-1,k+1)^{(1,0)}-\\zeta(-1,k+2)^{(1,0)}\\right)\\right)\\pi\\, \\Gamma(k+2)^2}{2\\,\\Gamma(k+\\frac{3}{2})^2}} $$ However, I have been unsuccessful producing partial products on my own. Taking the $\\ln$ of the product to try to find the partial sums; Trying to transform the following integral into infinite product. $$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cos(x)}{1+x^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2e} $$ From what I have seen in some papers, the partial products are found, then the Stirling's Approximation is used to find the limit. Question: How can I prove the value of the given Infinite Product? Proofs or hints are both welcome. Thank you kindly for your help and time.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This answer is spliced from the paper linked in comments Melzak (1961) shows that the largest-volume cylinder (Cartesian product of a hypersphere and a line) in an $n$ -dimensional unit sphere occupies this proportion of the sphere: $$\\rho_n=\\frac{2(n\\pi)^{-1/2}(1-1/n)^{(n-1)/2}\\Gamma(n/2+1)}{\\Gamma((n+1)/2)}$$ We have $\\rho_2=\\frac2\\pi$ and $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\rho_n=\\sqrt{\\frac2{\\pi e}}$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the infinite product ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 + 2/n)^{(-1)^{n+1} n} equals π/(2e). \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question correctly. The user mentioned they tried multiplying known products for π/2 and 1/e but didn't get the result. They also tried partial products with Mathematica, which gave a complicated expression involving the Gamma function and the Riemann zeta function derivative. They considered taking the logarithm of the product and transforming an integral into an infinite product but didn't succeed.\n\nNow, structuring the problem as per the required format. The key here is to list all assumptions. The original problem states an infinite product starting from n=1, with each term being (1 + 2/n) raised to the power of (-1)^{n+1} * n. The problem is to prove this product equals π/(2e). \n\nAssumptions: Each term in the product is (1 + 2/n) for n starting at 1. The exponent is (-1)^{n+1} * n. The product is infinite, going to ∞. The problem is to show the product equals π/(2e). Each assumption should be one line, addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption: The product is taken over all positive integers n starting from 1.\nAssumption: Each term in the product is (1 + 2/n).\nAssumption: The exponent of each term is (-1)^{n+1} multiplied by n.\nAssumption: The product converges to a limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't explicitly state convergence; the user is asking to prove it equals π/(2e). So maybe the convergence is part of what needs to be proven, but perhaps in the assumptions, we can note that the product is an infinite product. So the problem is to show that the value is π/(2e), which would inherently require convergence. But according to the example given earlier, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the example, the user restructured it. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the user's formatted version added that. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which isn't part of the original problem. That might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example? Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems wrong. But the user's instruction says to list all assumptions of the problem. So perhaps in the example, the user erroneously added an assumption. Hmm. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction for the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions are: the product starts at n=1, each term is (1+2/n) with exponent (-1)^{n+1}n. The problem is to prove the product equals π/(2e). So the assumptions are about the structure of the product. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions, so the assumptions are just the components of the product. So each line should be one condition. So:\n\nAssumption: The product is taken from n=1 to infinity.\nAssumption: Each term of the product is (1 + 2/n).\nAssumption: Each term is raised to the power of (-1)^{n+1} multiplied by n.\nProblem: Prove that the product equals π/(2e).\n\nThat's it. The problem doesn't specify any constraints on convergence or other variables, just the structure of the product. The user is asking to prove the equality. So the assumptions are the components of the product expression.",
