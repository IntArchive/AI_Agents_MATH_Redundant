    "Content": "Let $K$ be a number field, let $\\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $K$, and let $L,L'$ be extensions of $K$. Suppose $\\mathfrak{p}$ doesn't ramify in either $L$ or $L'$. Is there a simple proof that $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified in the composite field $LL'$? Google searching, I found a proof in Narkiewicz, Elementary and Analytic Theory of Algebraic Numbers , p. 159, but it uses the different, which I am not comfortable with yet. Can this be proven without the different? If it would simplify things, I would be mostly satisfied with the case that $K=\\mathbb{Q}$. Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The result you are looking for is Theorem 31 of Marcus' Number Fields . I am appending the proof here in case you don't have a copy of it. Suppose $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified in $L$ and $L'$; let $P$ be a prime of $LL'$ lying over $\\mathfrak{p}$. We wish to show that $e(P|\\mathfrak{p}) = 1.$ Let $M$ be the normal closure of $LL'$ and let $Q$ be a prime in $M$ lying over $P$. Thus we have inclusions\n$$\\mathfrak{p} \\subseteq P \\subseteq Q.$$ Let $E$ denote the inertia group $E(Q|\\mathfrak{p})$. Now the primes $Q \\cap \\mathcal{O}_L$ and $Q \\cap \\mathcal{O}_{L'}$ are unramified in $L$ and $L'$ respectively because $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified in those places.   By virtue of the inertia field $M^E$ being the largest extension in which $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified, we have $L \\subseteq M^E$ and $L' \\subseteq M^E$. However this means that the composite $$LL' \\subseteq M^E$$ from which it follows that $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified in $LL'$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking for a proof that if a prime 𝔭 in a number field K doesn't ramify in two extensions L and L', then it shouldn't ramify in the composite field LL'. They want an elementary proof without using the different, and they mentioned the case K=ℚ might be simpler.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what ramification means. A prime 𝔭 in K is unramified in an extension L if, when you factor 𝔭 into prime ideals in L, none of the exponents (the ramification indices) are greater than 1. So if 𝔭 is unramified in both L and L', we need to show that in their composite LL', 𝔭 remains unramified.\n\nI remember that the composite field LL' is the smallest field containing both L and L'. The key might be to look at the decomposition of 𝔭 in LL'. Since ramification indices multiply in towers, maybe we can relate the ramification in LL' to that in L and L'.\n\nBut how to do this without invoking the different? The different is related to the discriminant, and the discriminant of a composite field is related to the discriminants of the individual fields. If both L and L' have discriminants coprime to 𝔭, then maybe the discriminant of LL' is also coprime to 𝔭, implying 𝔭 is unramified. But is that an elementary approach?\n\nWait, the discriminant of an extension tells us about ramified primes: a prime ramifies in L/K if and only if it divides the discriminant of L/K. So if 𝔭 doesn't ramify in L or L', then 𝔭 doesn't divide the discriminants of L/K and L'/K. Then the discriminant of LL'/K would divide the product of the discriminants of L and L' raised to some power (maybe by the formula for discriminants in compositum fields). If 𝔭 doesn't divide either discriminant, it shouldn't divide their product, hence not divide the discriminant of LL', so 𝔭 is unramified in LL'.\n\nBut is that a rigorous proof? Let me check. The discriminant of the compositum LL' over K divides the product of the discriminants of L and L' over K each raised to the degree of the other extension. So disc(LL'/K) | disc(L/K)^{[L':K]} * disc(L'/K)^{[L:K]}. If 𝔭 doesn't divide disc(L/K) or disc(L'/K), then it can't divide their product, hence not divide disc(LL'/K). Therefore, 𝔭 is unramified in LL'.\n\nThis seems to work. But does this count as \"elementary\"? The user mentions they found a proof using the different, but want to avoid that. Using discriminants is maybe more elementary since discriminants are introduced earlier in algebraic number theory. However, maybe there's another way without discriminants either.\n\nAlternatively, consider the inertia field. The inertia group of a prime in the compositum would be related to the inertia groups in L and L'. If both inertia groups are trivial (since 𝔭 is unramified in both), then the inertia group in the compositum should also be trivial. But this approach uses Galois groups and perhaps requires the extensions to be Galois. The original problem doesn't state that L and L' are Galois over K, so maybe this is a restriction. However, if we can assume the extensions are Galois, then this might work, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify that the extensions are Galois. So perhaps the discriminant approach is better. Also, when the user says \"mostly satisfied with the case K=ℚ\", maybe in that case, some simplifications occur. For example, over ℚ, primes are principal, and maybe the extensions are easier to handle. But the discriminant argument should still hold.\n\nSo, summarizing the steps:\n\n1. If a prime 𝔭 is unramified in L/K and L'/K, then 𝔭 does not divide the discriminants disc(L/K) and disc(L'/K).\n2. The discriminant of the compositum LL' over K divides a product of powers of disc(L/K) and disc(L'/K).\n3. Hence, 𝔭 does not divide disc(LL'/K), so 𝔭 is unramified in LL'.\n\nThis would be the proof using discriminants. Is there a way to phrase this without discriminants? Maybe by considering the ramification indices directly. Suppose in LL', a prime above 𝔭 has ramification index e. Then, when restricted to L, the ramification index e_L divides e, and similarly for L', e_L' divides e. Since e_L and e_L' are both 1 (as 𝔭 is unramified in both), then e must be 1. Therefore, 𝔭 is unramified in LL'.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. If we have a prime 𝔓 in LL' lying over 𝔭 in K, then the ramification index e(𝔓|𝔭) is equal to the ramification index in L if we restrict 𝔓 to L. But since 𝔭 is unramified in L, then e(𝔓∩L | 𝔭) =1. Similarly, e(𝔓∩L' | 𝔭)=1. But how does that relate to e(𝔓|𝔭)?\n\nIn general, for a tower of fields K ⊆ F ⊆ LL', the ramification index e(𝔓|𝔭) = e(𝔓|𝔓∩F) * e(𝔓∩F|𝔭). If F is either L or L', then e(𝔓∩F|𝔭)=1. So e(𝔓|𝔭) = e(𝔓|𝔓∩F). But since 𝔓 lies above both L and L', perhaps we can bound e(𝔓|𝔭) by both e over L and e over L'. Wait, maybe I need to use the fact that the compositum's ramification index is the least common multiple of the ramification indices in L and L', but since both are 1, the lcm is 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if we take a prime 𝔓 in LL' over 𝔭, and consider the decomposition in L and L'. Let 𝔮 = 𝔓 ∩ L and 𝔮' = 𝔓 ∩ L'. Since 𝔭 is unramified in L and L', then e(𝔮|𝔭)=1 and e(𝔮'|𝔭)=1. Then in the compositum LL', e(𝔓|𝔭) must divide both e(𝔓|𝔮) and e(𝔓|𝔮'). But since e(𝔓|𝔮) divides [LL' : L], and e(𝔓|𝔮') divides [LL' : L'], but I don't see the direct relation here. Maybe this approach isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if a prime is unramified in two extensions, then their compositum is unramified. This might be a standard result. But how to prove it without using the different or discriminants? Maybe localizing at 𝔭. Let me consider the local fields. If K_𝔭 is the completion of K at 𝔭, then L ⊗_K K_𝔭 and L' ⊗_K K_𝔭 are unramified extensions of K_𝔭. The compositum LL' ⊗_K K_𝔭 is the compositum of L⊗K_𝔭 and L'⊗K_𝔭. Since unramified extensions of local fields are closed under compositum, their compositum is unramified. Hence, 𝔭 is unramified in LL'. But does this count as elementary? It uses completions and local fields, which might be more advanced.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the ring of integers of LL' is generated by the rings of integers of L and L'. If 𝔭 doesn't ramify in either, then the extensions of 𝔭 to L and L' are unramified. Then, in the compositum, the primes above 𝔭 should also be unramified. But I need to make this precise.\n\nAnother approach: Use the fact that the discriminant of LL' divides the product of discriminants of L and L'. Wait, that's similar to the discriminant argument. If 𝔭 doesn't divide disc(L) or disc(L'), then it can't divide disc(LL'), so 𝔭 is unramified.\n\nBut maybe this is considered using the different, since the discriminant is related to the different. However, the user might consider discriminant arguments as separate from the different. Narkiewicz's proof uses the different, but maybe the discriminant approach is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the answer would involve stating that since 𝔭 is unramified in L and L', their discriminants are not divisible by 𝔭, hence the discriminant of the compositum, which divides a product of their discriminants, is also not divisible by 𝔭, so 𝔭 is unramified in LL'. This avoids using the different directly.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is okay with K=ℚ, maybe the proof is simpler. Over ℚ, primes correspond to integers, and we can use the fact that the discriminant of the compositum of two extensions with coprime discriminants is the product of the discriminants raised to the respective degrees. But even if discriminants aren't coprime, the discriminant of the compositum divides some product. But I think the main idea is the same.\n\nSo the key assumptions are that 𝔭 is unramified in both L and L', and the problem is to show it's unramified in the compositum. The answer would use discriminant properties or decomposition of primes in composita.",
