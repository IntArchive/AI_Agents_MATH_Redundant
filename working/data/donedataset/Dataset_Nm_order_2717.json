    "Content": "I've never worked out the general proof of l'Hôpital before, and am taking the opportunity to do so before I return to the soul-crushing grind of college life. I looked in Spivak and found a fine proof of the $(x \\rightarrow a$ and $f(x), g(x) \\rightarrow 0)$ case; but when he went to prove the $(x \\rightarrow \\infty, f(x), g(x) \\rightarrow 0)$ case, he made a suggestion which actually does not work. (He proposed applying l'Hôpital for the first case above to $f(1/x) / g(1/x)$ as $x \\rightarrow 0$, but since he used the fact that $f(0)$ and $g(0)$ could be defined to prove the first case, his version doesn't seem to apply. Correct me if I'm wrong!) I adapted this proof of the second case. Theorem : Suppose that $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x), \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(x) = 0$, and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = l$. Then $ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = l.$ Proof : Note as a lemma that there exists an interval $I = (c, \\infty)$ on which $g'(x) \\neq 0$ $g(x) \\neq 0$ (The hypothesis implies (1); to prove (2), note that every interval $(\\eta, \\infty)$ would otherwise have $g(\\xi) = 0$, so taking any $\\eta ' > \\eta$, there would be $g'(x) = 0$ on $(\\xi, \\xi ')$, and thus on $(\\eta, \\infty)$, against (1).) Fix $\\epsilon > 0$. By hypothesis, $\\exists M: x > M \\implies |\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} - l| <  \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$. If $M < c$, choose $M = c$ so $M \\in I$. Now pick any $y > M$. By Cauchy, $\\forall x > y$ we get $($for $\\mu \\in (y, x))$ $$\\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{g(x) - g(y)} = \\frac{f'(\\mu)}{g'(\\mu)}.$$ But if we take $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty}$ of both sides, we find $$\\lim_{x \\to \\infty}\\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{g(x) - g(y)} = \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f'(\\mu)}{g'(\\mu)}. $$ We know that the RHS limit is determinate; we also know that $$ l - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} < \\frac{f'(\\mu)}{g'(\\mu)} < l + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\implies l - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\leq \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f'(\\mu)}{g'(\\mu)} \\leq l + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$$ $$\\therefore l - \\epsilon < \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)} < l + \\epsilon .$$ We have therefore furnished $M : |\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} - l| < \\epsilon$ if $x > M$. This proves the theorem. I now feel a sudden urge to begin overusing l'Hôpital! Someone, please tell me if this is correct, so I can go at it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't see any major problems with your proof. Though, expanding on Spivak's hint, $f(1/x)g(1/x)$ doesn't work immediately. But, note that\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(1/x) = \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} f(u) = 0 \n$$\nand similarly for $g$. Hence the functions \n$$\nf^*(x) = \\lim_{z\\to x} f(1/z),\n$$\n$$\ng^*(x) = \\lim_{z\\to x} g(1/z)\n$$ do satisfy the hypotheses for L'Hopital on some interval $[0,\\epsilon]$ for $\\epsilon > 0$, (think of taking the reciprocal of the interval $[M,\\infty]$, then $\\epsilon = 1/M$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's break down the problem presented in the Math Stack Exchange question. The user is trying to prove the case of l'Hôpital's rule where x approaches infinity, and both f(x) and g(x) approach 0. They mentioned adapting a proof but want verification if their approach is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The original theorem states that the limits of f(x) and g(x) as x approaches infinity are both 0. Additionally, the limit of f'(x)/g'(x) as x approaches infinity exists and is equal to l. The problem is to prove that under these conditions, the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x approaches infinity is also l.\n\nThe user’s proof starts by establishing an interval I where g’(x) isn’t zero and g(x) isn’t zero. They use Cauchy's mean value theorem for some y > M and take the limit as x approaches infinity. Then, they relate the limit of the ratio [f(x)-f(y)]/[g(x)-g(y)] to f’(μ)/g’(μ) using the mean value theorem. By taking the limit, they argue that the ratio f(y)/g(y) must be within ε of l, thus proving the limit.\n\nNow, to structure this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to the relevant objects (f, g, their derivatives, etc.). The problem statement is to prove the limit of f(x)/g(x) equals l under those assumptions.\n\nPotential issues to check: The user mentions that Spivak’s approach might not work because f(0) and g(0) need to be defined. Their alternative approach uses the lemma about the interval I where g’ and g are non-zero. Then they apply Cauchy’s MVT and take limits. The key steps seem to be establishing the existence of such an interval, using the mean value theorem, and handling the limits correctly. The user’s proof seems to correctly handle the epsilon-delta definition by choosing M appropriately and showing the ratio stays within epsilon of l. So, the structured problem should capture the conditions on f, g, their derivatives, and the existence of the limit of the derivatives' ratio.",
