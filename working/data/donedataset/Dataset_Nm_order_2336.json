    "Content": "Let $E/k$ be an elliptic curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$.  Can one prove that the abelian group $E(k)$ is non-torsion? Better yet, can one prove that $E(k) \\otimes_\\mathbb Z \\mathbb Q$ is an infinite-dimensional $\\mathbb Q$-vector space? It is very tempting here to try to use the Lefschetz principle, to try to reduce the situation to $k= \\mathbb C$ where both statements are obvious. However I am not sure that one can actually apply the Lefschetz principle as it would require formulating the statements in the first-order theory of fields and I am unfortunately not much of a logician. At least one can say that if the field $k$ is uncountable then $E(k)$ is uncountable whereas $E(k)^{\\text{tors}}$ is countable (so much is true over any field), so there is always a non-torsion point. However when the field $k$ is countable, there seems to me to be no \"trivial\" reason why $E(k)$ should have an element of infinite order. The fact that $k$ has characteristic $0$ has to intervene somehow, as the statement is false in finite characteristic...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "After some searching, I found the following article: G. Frey and M. Jarden, Approximation theory and the rank of abelian varieties over large algebraic fields. Proc. London Maths. Soc. 28 (1974), 112-128. A link is provided on the second author's website ; see here for the actual article. In it, they prove the following: Theorem 10.1. If $A$ is an abelian variety of positive dimension defined over an algebraically closed field which is not the algebraic closure of a finite field, then the rank of $A(K)$ is equal to the cardinality of $K$. The proof is a bit cumbersome, but in the second remark following the theorem, they provide an alternative and more direct method that does not depend on the main results of their paper. This alternative method seems useful for the weaker question you asked. In the introduction, they also say: Another proof was indicated by J.-P. Serre in a letter. Since they do not include a reference for the letter, it might have been private communication. (I didn't search in Serre's Œuvres for the letter.) Or maybe Serre's proof is the alternative method they give. Remark. Note that the theorem is trivial for $K$ uncountable: The cardinality of $A(K)$ is at most that of $K$, with equality if $K$ is algebraically closed; The torsion is countable, since the $n$-torsion has size $\\leq n^{2g}$ (with equality if $\\operatorname{char} K \\nmid n$); Thus, $A(K) \\otimes_{\\mathbb Z} \\mathbb Q$ has the same cardinality as $K$. Thus, if $K$ is uncountable, then $A(K) \\otimes \\mathbb Q$ cannot be finite-dimensional. Now use that for $I$ infinite, the cardinality of $I$ equals the cardinality of $\\mathbb Q^{(I)}$ (but of course not that of $\\mathbb Q^I$; cf. Cantor's diagonal argument). Similarly, this argument proves for any infinite field (not necessarily algebraically closed, nor uncountable) that the dimension of $A(K) \\otimes \\mathbb Q$ is at most the cardinality of $K$. Thus, the only content of the theorem is exactly the question you asked: if $K$ is algebraically closed and not the algebraic closure of a finite field, does $A(K) \\otimes \\mathbb Q$ have infinite dimension?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Elliptic curve over algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 has a non-torsion point.\" The user is asking if one can prove that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion, or even better, that E(k) tensor Q is an infinite-dimensional Q-vector space. They mention using the Lefschetz principle but are unsure about its application. They also note that for uncountable k, E(k) is uncountable, hence non-torsion points exist, but for countable k, it's not obvious. They emphasize that characteristic 0 is crucial here.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about an elliptic curve E over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0. The user wants to prove that E(k) is non-torsion. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. E/k is an elliptic curve.\n2. k is an algebraically closed field.\n3. The characteristic of k is 0.\n\nEach assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property of one object. The problem statement is to prove that E(k) is non-torsion, or better yet, that E(k) tensor Q is infinite-dimensional over Q.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions two possible things to prove: the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion, and the stronger statement about E(k) tensor Q. Should both be included in the problem statement? The user presents them as alternatives: \"Can one prove that...? Better yet, can one prove that...?\" So perhaps the main problem is the first one, with the second being an optional stronger version. But the example given in the format includes only the main problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists the assumptions and the problem as proving divisibility by 91. The user had added an assumption about n being divisible by 7, which might have been part of the original problem or an edit. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, maybe that was an error? Wait, looking back, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem under Assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in the example? Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, so there's no assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the formatted problem adds that as an assumption, which would change the problem. That seems incorrect. But maybe the example was a mistake. Anyway, perhaps the user wants me to extract the assumptions from the problem as stated, not add new ones. Wait, the user says \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example might have a typo. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The key assumptions are:\n\n- E/k is an elliptic curve.\n- k is algebraically closed.\n- char k = 0.\n\nThe problem is to prove that E(k) is non-torsion (i.e., has at least one non-torsion point) or the stronger statement about E(k) tensor Q. But the main problem as posed in the question is the first part. The user then offers the stronger version as a better alternative. However, when structuring, perhaps we need to take the main problem as stated first. The user also mentions that in characteristic 0, the statement should hold, unlike in finite characteristic. So the critical assumptions are the three above.\n\nNow, the user also mentions the Lefschetz principle but is unsure about applying it. However, in structuring the problem, we don't include the user's thoughts on possible approaches, just the problem itself. So the assumptions are just the given conditions of the problem.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nE/k is an elliptic curve,\nk is an algebraically closed field,\nthe characteristic of k is 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion.\n\nBut the user also mentioned the alternative statement about E(k) ⊗ℤ ℚ being infinite-dimensional over ℚ. Should both be included? The original problem says \"Can one prove that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion? Better yet, can one prove that...\" So the main problem is the first, and the second is a follow-up. However, in the problem statement, perhaps we need to include both as separate parts? But the example only had one problem statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem has the same. Even though the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. But that might have been an error in the example. However, given the user's instruction, perhaps the task is to filter out unrelated information. So in the current problem, the user is asking two questions, but perhaps we need to present the main one as the problem, and the second as an additional part. Alternatively, the user might consider both as parts of the problem. However, the example only has one problem statement. To follow the format, perhaps we should include the main problem as \"Prove that E(k) is non-torsion\", and the stronger statement is a better version but not part of the structured problem unless specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be stated as two parts. But the example didn't do that. Given that the example only included one problem statement, maybe we should structure it as the main problem, and the stronger one as extra. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which includes one problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to prove that E(k) is non-torsion, with the assumptions listed. The stronger statement about the tensor product might be a different problem, but since the user presents it as \"better yet\", maybe it's part of the same problem. Alternatively, maybe both are separate parts. Hmm.\n\nThe original problem starts with \"Can one prove that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion? Better yet, can one prove that E(k) ⊗ℤ ℚ is an infinite-dimensional ℚ-vector space?\" So it's two questions, but the user is asking for either a proof of the first or the second. Since the example's format has one problem statement, perhaps we need to include both? But how? Alternatively, maybe the main problem is the first, and the second is a follow-up. However, since the user's instructions say to structure the problem as per the given format, which includes a single problem statement, I think we need to pick the main one. But the user might consider both as part of the problem. Alternatively, we can state both in the problem section. Let me see how the example was handled. In the example, the original problem had a single statement to prove. Here, the user has two related questions, but perhaps they are two aspects of the same problem. Alternatively, maybe the main problem is the first, and the second is a corollary or a stronger version. Since the user wrote \"Better yet\", perhaps they are two parts. But the format allows only one problem. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement should include both, separated by \"or\" or as two parts. However, the example didn't have multiple parts. Given the instructions, maybe it's safer to present the main problem as the first one, and the second as an additional part, but according to the example, it's supposed to be one problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove both statements. But the user's example didn't have that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main problem is the first, and the second is a follow-up. But the user wants the problem structured as per the example. Since the example included only the main problem, perhaps we need to structure the problem as the first statement. However, the user's answer might need to address both. But according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the given format, which includes one problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nE/k is an elliptic curve,\nk is an algebraically closed field,\nthe characteristic of k is 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion.\n\nAlternatively, if the user considers both parts as the problem, perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion, or better yet, prove that E(k) ⊗_ℤ ℚ is an infinite-dimensional ℚ-vector space.\n\nBut I need to check the example again. In the example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", which was the original question. Here, the original question has two parts. Therefore, to accurately represent the user's question, perhaps the problem should include both parts. However, the example format has a single problem statement. The user's instructions say to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which includes Assumption and Problem. So perhaps the problem can be written as two sentences separated by \"Better yet,\" as in the original question.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nProblem:\nCan one prove that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion? Better yet, can one prove that E(k) ⊗_ℤ ℚ is an infinite-dimensional ℚ-vector space?\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", turning the question into a statement to prove. The original example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", whereas the original problem was phrased as \"Prove that for every integer n...\". Therefore, perhaps the problem should be phrased as a statement to prove, even if the original question was posed as a question. So in this case, the problem would be:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion. Better yet, prove that E(k) ⊗_ℤ ℚ is an infinite-dimensional ℚ-vector space.\n\nBut is this acceptable? The example's problem was a single statement. However, the current problem has two related statements. To adhere to the format, perhaps the problem should include both as parts. Alternatively, since the user's instruction says \"structure that problem\", maybe the problem part should encapsulate the entire problem as stated, which includes both questions. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nCan one prove that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion? Better yet, can one prove that E(k) ⊗_ℤ ℚ is an infinite-dimensional ℚ-vector space?\n\nBut the example rephrased the question as a statement to prove. The original example question was \"Prove that...\", so in the formatted problem, it became \"Prove that...\". Therefore, to follow the example, perhaps we should rephrase the questions as statements to prove. Hence:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion. Better yet, prove that E(k) ⊗_ℤ ℚ is an infinite-dimensional ℚ-vector space.\n\nBut maybe the user wants the problem to be exactly as in the original, but structured. The example took the original problem, which was \"Prove that...\", and kept it as the problem statement. Here, the original problem is phrased as two questions. Therefore, to follow the example, perhaps we should present them as statements to prove. Alternatively, keep the questions as is. But in academic contexts, problems are often stated as imperatives (\"Prove that...\") rather than questions. Therefore, it's more appropriate to convert the questions into statements to prove. Hence:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion. As a stronger result, prove that E(k) ⊗_ℤ ℚ is an infinite-dimensional ℚ-vector space.\n\nAlternatively, combine them with \"or better yet\" as in the original. But the example didn't have multiple parts. Perhaps to keep it concise, the main problem is the first part, and the second is an optional stronger version. But since the user's instructions don't specify handling multiple parts, and the example includes one problem statement, maybe the formatted problem should only include the first part. However, that would omit the user's \"better yet\" part. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement should include both, separated by a semicolon or as two sentences.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering the example and the user's instructions, the formatted problem should include both parts as they are integral to the original question. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nE/k is an elliptic curve,\nk is an algebraically closed field,\nthe characteristic of k is 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the abelian group E(k) is non-torsion; better yet, prove that E(k) ⊗_ℤ ℚ is an infinite-dimensional ℚ-vector space.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a single statement. However, given that the original problem has two related questions, it's better to include both in the problem section. Therefore, I will structure it as such.",
