    "Content": "Pitt Theorem says that any bounded linear operator $T\\colon \\ell^r \\to \\ell^p$, $1 \\leq p < r < \\infty$, or $T\\colon c_0 \\to \\ell^p$ is compact. I know how to prove this in case $\\ell^r \\to \\ell^p$, and $c_0 \\to \\ell^p$, where $p > 1$. Main idea in the first case is that $\\ell^r$ is reflexive and hence closed ball $B_{\\ell^r}$ is weakly compact. In the second case we could just use Schauder Theorem ($T$ is compact if and only if $T^*$ is compact). The only case left is $T\\colon c_0 \\to \\ell^1$. I have tried something like this: By Schauder Theorem we need to prove that $T^*\\colon \\ell^\\infty \\to \\ell^1$ is compact. By Banach-Alaoglu Theorem we know that $B_{\\ell^\\infty}$ is compact in the $weak^{*}$ topology on $\\ell^\\infty$. Moreover, we know, since $\\ell^1$ is separable, that $B_{\\ell^\\infty}$ is metrizable. Hence, it is enough to prove that if $(x_n)$ is a $weak{}^{*}$ convergent (say, to $x$) sequence in $B_{\\ell^\\infty}$ then $(Tx_n)$ converges (to $Tx$, I think). Since Schur Theorem (weak and norm convergence is the same in $\\ell^1$) we only need to show that $(Tx_n)$ converges weakly in $\\ell^1$. And here I stuck. Could you give me any ideas or references? In every book I have looked so far this particular case was omitted. Edit (4.4.2011): I found in Diestel's Sequences and series in Banach spaces (chap. VII, Exercise 2(ii)) something like this: A bounded operator $T: c_0 \\to X$ is compact if and only if every subseries of $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty Te_n$ is convergent, where $(e_n)$ is canonical basis for $c_0$. I know how to prove this, but how we can show that operators $T: c_0 \\to \\ell^1$ possess the subseries property?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In my opinion, the proof strategy is straightforward. Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in $B_{c_0}$, the unit ball of $c_0$. As $((Tx_n)(1))_n$ is a bounded sequence of scalars, there is a bounded subsequence converging to some scalar y_1. Now, inductively, you have a sub-sub-... sequence, call it for simplicity $(x_m)$ of $(x_n)$, and an element $y = (y_i)_i$ such that for each $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ $(T(x_m)(i)) \\to y_i$ as $m \\to \\infty$. Now $\\sum_i |y_i| \\leq \\sum_i |y_i - T(x_m)(i)| + \\sum_i |T(x_m)(i)|$. The latter series is bounded by $||T||$ independently of $m$. The first series can be made arbitrary small for large $m$ by construction. Hence $y \\in l^1$ and $T(x_m) \\to y$ as $m\\to \\infty$ in norm (the first series).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully. The user is asking about the compactness of a bounded operator T from c_0 to l^1. They mention Pitt's Theorem, which states that any bounded linear operator from l^r to l^p (with 1 ≤ p < r < ∞) or from c_0 to l^p is compact. The user knows how to handle the cases where the target space is l^p with p > 1, but the specific case of T: c_0 → l^1 is left. \n\nThey tried using Schauder's Theorem, which requires showing that the adjoint operator T*: l^∞ → l^1 is compact. They considered the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem and the metrizability of the unit ball in l^∞ under the weak-* topology. Then, they wanted to show that if a sequence converges weak-*, then T*(x_n) converges in norm in l^1, using Schur's Theorem which states that in l^1, weak and norm convergence coincide. However, they got stuck at showing weak convergence. \n\nThe edit mentions a reference to Diestel's book, which states that a bounded operator T: c_0 → X is compact iff every subseries of ΣTe_n is convergent. The user wants to know how to show that operators T: c_0 → l^1 have this subseries property.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The problem is to prove that a bounded operator T: c_0 → l^1 is compact. The assumptions would include the properties given by Pitt's Theorem, the specific spaces involved (c_0 and l^1), and perhaps the use of the subseries property from Diestel's exercise. Let me list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n- T is a bounded linear operator from c_0 to l^1.\n- Pitt's Theorem applies to operators from c_0 to l^p, but the case p=1 requires a separate proof.\n- The adjoint operator T* maps from l^∞ to l^1.\n- The unit ball in l^∞ is weak-* compact and metrizable due to l^1's separability.\n- Schur's Theorem states that in l^1, weak convergence implies norm convergence.\n- Diestel's condition: T is compact iff every subseries of ΣTe_n converges in l^1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the bounded operator T: c_0 → l^1 is compact.\n\nWait, the original problem is about proving the compactness of T: c_0 → l^1 using the given theorems and conditions. The user is stuck on showing that T* is compact via weak-* convergent sequences leading to norm convergence in l^1, and alternatively, using the subseries property. So the core problem is proving T is compact under these assumptions. The problem statement in the formatted version should capture that. Let me check the example again. The example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is to prove that T is compact, given the context. But according to Pitt's Theorem, it's stated that operators from c_0 to l^p (including p=1?) are compact. Wait, the user says Pitt's Theorem says that T: c_0 → l^p is compact for 1 ≤ p < r < ∞. Wait, no, in the original question, Pitt's Theorem is stated as applying to T: l^r → l^p with 1 ≤ p < r < ∞ or T: c_0 → l^p. The user then mentions that they know how to prove for p > 1 but the case p=1 is left. So the problem is about proving the case when p=1, i.e., T: c_0 → l^1 is compact. Therefore, the problem is to prove that any bounded operator T: c_0 → l^1 is compact, as per Pitt's Theorem. \n\nSo the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is a bounded linear operator.\n- T maps from c_0 to ℓ^1.\n- The adjoint operator T* maps from ℓ^∞ to ℓ^1.\n- The closed unit ball in ℓ^∞ is compact in the weak-* topology.\n- The closed unit ball in ℓ^∞ is metrizable due to ℓ^1's separability.\n- In ℓ^1, weak convergence and norm convergence are equivalent (Schur's Theorem).\n- A bounded operator T: c_0 → X is compact if and only if every subseries of ∑Te_n is convergent (Diestel's condition).\n\nEach of these should be separate lines. Then the problem is to prove that T is compact. But the problem as per the user's original question is to prove the compactness of T: c_0 → ℓ^1. So putting it all together.",
