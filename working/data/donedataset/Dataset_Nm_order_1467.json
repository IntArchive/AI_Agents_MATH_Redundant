    "Content": "This puzzle is from a Russian web-site http://www.arbuz.uz/ and\nthere are many solutions to it, but mine uses linear algebra and is very naive.\nThere’s a planet inhabited by arbuzoids (watermeloners, to translate from Russian).\nThose creatures are found in three colors: red, green and blue. There are 13 red\narbuzoids, 15 blue ones, and 17 green. When two differently colored arbuzoids\nmeet, they both change to the third color.\nThe question is, can it ever happen that all of them assume the same color? Edited: Apr 10, 2021, I just wanted to add that this is quoted from Jim Hefferon, Linear Algebra . I still have no idea how this problem carved its way into my Linear Algebra book, but I gave it a go. Strangely, I didn't realize the relationship this had with Linear Algebra,  so I decided to formalize it. let $S$ be a set such that: $\\langle 13, 17, 15\\rangle \\in S $ $\\forall r,g,b,a \\in \\mathbb N ( \\langle r,g,b\\rangle\\in S \\to ($ $[(a \\leq r \\land a\\leq g) \\to \\langle r-a,g-a,b+2a\\rangle \\in S] \\land$ $\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\space[(a \\leq r \\land a\\leq b) \\to \\langle r-a,g+2a,b-a\\rangle \\in S] \\land$ $\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\space[(a \\leq g \\land a\\leq b) \\to \\langle r+2a,g-a,b-a\\rangle \\in S] \\space ))$ We have to show that: $\\exists a \\in \\mathbb N(\\langle a,0,0 \\rangle\\in S \\lor \\langle 0,a,0 \\rangle\\in S \\lor \\langle 0,0,a \\rangle\\in S) \\tag{I}$ or.. $\\not\\exists a \\in \\mathbb N(\\langle a,0,0 \\rangle\\in S \\lor \\langle 0,a,0 \\rangle\\in S \\lor \\langle 0,0,a \\rangle\\in S) \\tag{II}$ I don't know how this is at all related to Linear Algebra, and I barely know anything about set theory, so bye. What I did I started from the first element in $S$ , as shown. First start with the element. remember, the order is red, green, blue: $\\langle 13,17,15 \\rangle \\in S \\tag{0}$ Eliminate the red arbuzoids: $\\langle 0,43,2 \\rangle \\in S \\tag{1}$ combine $1$ green with $1$ blue: $\\langle 2,42,1 \\rangle \\in S \\tag{2}$ Note that if the blue arbuzoids in $(1)$ were $3$ , the problem would have been solved.Also, If they had been any multiple of 3 less than or equal to green,  the problem would have been solved, since you'll combine 1 third of blue with green, and then red and blue would be equal, then you combine them, and get all green. Anyway,the  blue arbuzoids were not 3. I did many failed steps, noting a few things, and I couldn't get anything. I decided to write some code to test(i.e brute force the combinations and find) whether it's possible, starting from (2), but it failed to reach anything. Can you prove $(I)$ , or $(II)$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The problem can be equivalently stated as follows: Find $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb N$ such that\n  $$\\begin{pmatrix} 13 \\\\ 17 \\\\ 15\\end{pmatrix} + a\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + b\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + c \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\left \\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 45 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 45 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 45 \\end{pmatrix} \\right \\}$$ This amounts to solving three linear systems. For example, the first one is given by:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 13 \\\\ 17 \\\\ 15\\end{pmatrix} + a\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + b\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + c \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 45 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nand can be rewritten as\n$$\\begin{cases} 2 a - b - c = 32 \\\\ -a + 2b - c = -17 \\\\ -a - b + 2 c = -15 \\end{cases}$$\nSolving for $a, b, c$ we obtain\n$$a = n, \\qquad b = n - \\frac {49} 3, \\qquad c = n - \\frac {47} 3$$\nwhere $n$ is a parameter. Since $a, b, c$ must be positive integers, there is no solution.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, there are these creatures called arbuzoids, right? They come in three colors: red, green, and blue. The numbers are 13 red, 17 green, and 15 blue. The rule is that when two differently colored ones meet, they both change to the third color. The big question is: can they all end up the same color?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the transformation rules. If a red and green meet, they both become blue. Similarly, red and blue become green, and green and blue become red. Each meeting reduces the count of the two original colors by one each and increases the third color by two. So, for example, if we have (r, g, b) and a red and green meet, it becomes (r-1, g-1, b+2). \n\nThe problem is asking if it's possible for all arbuzoids to be one color. That would mean either (a, 0, 0), (0, a, 0), or (0, 0, a) for some a. The user mentioned trying to use linear algebra but ended up formalizing it with set theory. They tried some steps but couldn't reach a conclusion. Their code also didn't find a solution.\n\nHmm, maybe there's an invariant here. In problems like this, often some modulo arithmetic or invariant remains constant regardless of the operations. Let's see. Let's consider the changes in the numbers modulo some number. \n\nWhen two colors meet, say red and green: r decreases by 1, g decreases by 1, b increases by 2. The total number of arbuzoids is always 13 + 17 + 15 = 45. So the total is constant. Therefore, if all become one color, that color must have 45, and the others 0. So, we need to check if 45 can be achieved in one color while the others are zero.\n\nBut maybe looking at the differences modulo something. Let's consider the parities. Let's see:\n\nEach operation changes two colors by -1 and one by +2. Let's track the counts modulo 2. For instance, starting with red=13 (odd), green=17 (odd), blue=15 (odd). All are odd. Now, when you do an operation, two counts decrease by 1 (so even becomes odd or odd becomes even), and one increases by 2 (which doesn't change parity). So, for example, if we take red and green: both odd, decrease by 1, so even and even. Blue was odd, increases by 2, remains odd. So new parities: even, even, odd. Similarly, if you do another operation on even and even, say red and green again: they become odd, odd, and blue becomes odd again. Wait, but in this case, the parities cycle. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider modulo 3. Let's see. The total is 45, which is divisible by 3. If all colors are to end up as one, then that color must be 45, which is 0 mod 3. Let's check the initial counts: 13 mod 3 is 1, 17 mod 3 is 2, 15 mod 3 is 0. So 1, 2, 0.\n\nEach operation involves taking two colors, subtracting 1 each, and adding 2 to the third. Let's see what happens modulo 3. Suppose we take red and green (1 and 2). Subtract 1 from each: 0 and 1, add 2 to blue: 0 + 2 = 2. So new counts modulo 3: 0,1,2. Hmm. If we take red and blue (1 and 0), subtract 1 each: 0 and -1 (which is 2 mod 3), add 2 to green: 2 + 2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. So new counts: 0,1,2. Wait, same as before. If we take green and blue (2 and 0), subtract 1 each: 1 and -1 (2 mod 3), add 2 to red: 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. So counts become 0,1,2. Interesting. So regardless of which two colors we pick, modulo 3, the result cycles through 0,1,2. Wait, but starting from 1,2,0. Let me check:\n\nStarting with (13,17,15) ≡ (1,2,0) mod 3.\n\nAfter one operation, let's pick red and green: (1-1, 2-1, 0+2) = (0,1,2) mod 3.\n\nAnother operation, say red and blue (0 and 2). But red is 0, blue is 2. Subtract 1 each: -1 (2) and 1, add 2 to green: 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0. So now (2,0,1) mod 3.\n\nAnother operation, green and blue (0 and 1). Subtract 1 each: -1 (2) and 0, add 2 to red: 2 + 2 = 4 ≡ 1. Now (1,2,0) mod 3. Wait, we're back to the original configuration. So modulo 3, the counts cycle through (1,2,0) → (0,1,2) → (2,0,1) → (1,2,0), etc. \n\nTherefore, the residues modulo 3 cycle every three operations and never reach (0,0,0). But the target is to have two colors zero and one color 45, which is 0 mod 3. So if two colors are zero, the third is 45 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, the residues would be (0,0,0). But our cycle never includes (0,0,0). Therefore, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but in our operations, we can only reach the cycle (1,2,0), (0,1,2), (2,0,1). So none of these include (0,0,0). Therefore, it's impossible to reach a state where all are one color. Hence, answer II: it's not possible.\n\nBut let me verify this again. Let's suppose that all become red, so (45,0,0). Then 45 mod 3 is 0, and 0,0. But our residues never hit (0,0,0). So that's impossible. Similarly for the other colors. Therefore, the conclusion is that it's impossible. Hence, answer II.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that it's not possible, i.e., II holds.",
