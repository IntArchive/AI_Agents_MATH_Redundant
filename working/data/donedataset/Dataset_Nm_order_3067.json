    "Content": "Show that the determinant of the matrix \\begin{pmatrix} a && -c && -b \\\\\n  b && a - 2c && -c -2b \\\\ c && b && a -2c\n \\end{pmatrix} is non zero for all integers $a,b,c$ where $abc \\ne 0$ There is an interesting way to do this by using integral domains. It is easy to see that the polynomial $t^3 + 2t + 1$ is prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[t]$ so the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[t]/\\langle t^3+2t+1\\rangle$ is an integral domain and isomorphic to the ring $\\{a + bu + cu^2 \\vert \\text{$a,b,c$ are integers}\\}$ where $u$ is a root of the equation $t^3 +2t + 1 =0$ . Now consider integers $a,b,c$ and $x,y,z$ such that $abc \\ne  0$ and $(a +bu + cu^2)(x + yu + zu^2) = 0$ . These are element of an integral domain so we must have that $x = y = z = 0$ since at least one of $a,b$ and $c$ are nonzero. But expanding the above equation we get a system of linear equations in terms of $x,y$ and $z$ . $$\n\\begin{aligned} \nax- cy -bz &= 0 \\\\ \nbx+ (a-2c)y + (-c-2b)z &= 0\\\\ \nc x+b y+ (a-2c)z &= 0 \n\\end{aligned} \n$$ If the determinant is $0$ then this equation will have a nontrivial solution which is not possible. This strategy requires the use of integral domains which is an abstract tool. Are there any elementary ways to solve this? It gets messy when we try to do row operations or try to expand the determinant. Update : After  Carl Schildkraut's and JimmyK4542's answer. A curious observation: We can also prove that the element $t^3 + rt + 1$ is prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[t]$ for $r \\ne 0, -2$ . Therefore by similar arguments\nwe can say that the determinant of the matrix \\begin{pmatrix} a && -c && -b \\\\\n  b && a - rc && -c -rb \\\\ c && b && a -rc\n \\end{pmatrix} is non zero for all integers $a,b,c,r$ where $abc \\ne 0$ and $r \\ne 0,-2$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Say we have a counterexample. If $3$ divides each of $a,b,c$ , then we can divide each by $3$ without consequence, and obtain another counterexample. We may do this until $3$ fails to divide one of $a,b,c$ . However, we may calculate that $3$ fails to divide the determinant in any other case. To do this we would ordinarily have $26$ cases. However, since our polynomial is homogeneous in $a,b,c$ , we only need to check triples up to scaling, which halves the number of cases. When two of $\\{a,b,c\\}$ are $0\\bmod 3$ this check is easy, as only a single nonzero term persists in the determinant expansion. This reduces it to only $10$ cases, each of which can be checked by hand (it may even be possible to reduce further without much computation). Remark. This strategy works for any prime $p$ for which $t^3+2t+1$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb F_p[t]$ . This isn't true for $p=2$ , so $p=3$ yields the fewest number of cases.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about showing that a certain matrix has a non-zero determinant for all integers a, b, c where abc ≠ 0. The user mentioned an approach using integral domains but is asking for an elementary method.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a, b, c are integers with abc ≠ 0. The matrix given is a 3x3 matrix with entries involving a, b, c. The determinant of this matrix needs to be non-zero under these conditions.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So in this case, the main assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c are integers.\n- abc ≠ 0.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user also mentions the matrix structure. Do I need to include that as an assumption? The problem is to show that the determinant is non-zero given the matrix and the conditions on a, b, c. The matrix is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the assumptions should only be the conditions on the variables.\n\nBut the problem statement includes the specific matrix, so the problem part should include the matrix. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The matrix here is part of the problem to be solved, so it's included in the problem statement, not the assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions here are about the variables a, b, c being integers and abc ≠ 0. The problem is to show that the determinant of that specific matrix is non-zero under these conditions.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user later mentions an updated version with a more general matrix involving a parameter r, but the main problem is for r=2 (since the original matrix has entries like a-2c and -c-2b). However, in the updated part, they mention r ≠ 0, -2. But the original problem is specifically for the given matrix, which corresponds to r=2. So the main problem to structure is the original one, not the generalized version. The user's example includes only the original problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- a, b, c are integers.\n- abc ≠ 0.\n\nThe problem is to show that the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix is non-zero under these conditions.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is on a separate line and addresses one property. So \"a, b, c are integers\" is one line, and \"abc ≠ 0\" is another. Then the problem statement includes the matrix and the requirement that the determinant is non-zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are integers,\nabc ≠ 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the determinant of the matrix \n\\begin{pmatrix} \na & -c & -b \\\\\nb & a - 2c & -c -2b \\\\ \nc & b & a -2c \n\\end{pmatrix} \nis non-zero for all integers a, b, c where abc ≠ 0.\n\nYes, that seems right. The original problem mentions that the determinant is non-zero for all integers a, b, c with abc ≠ 0. The matrix is part of the problem statement. The assumptions are the conditions on a, b, c. The integral domain method is part of the context but not part of the problem's assumptions. The user is asking for an elementary way, but that's part of the question's request, not the problem structure. The structured problem should only include the necessary assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
