    "Content": "Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of index $p$, where $p$ is a prime. If $\\operatorname{gcd}(|H|, p-1)=1$, then $H$ must be normal. Does somebody have a quick proof of this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By induction on $|G|$, we can assume that there is no non-trivial normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ contained in $H$.  Thus the action of $G$ on the conjugates of $H$ gives an embedding of $G$ into $S_p$, of order $p!$.  Thus $|H|$ divides $(p-1)!$, and so $p$ does not divide $|H|$.  Thus the Sylow p-groups of $G$ are cyclic of order $p$. Now if any $h\\in H$ normalized a Sylow p-group $P$, then $h$ would map into $Aut(P)\\cong C_{p-1}$, and by hypothesis the image would be trivial.  That is, any $h\\in H$ normalizing $P$ also centralizes $P$.  It follows that $N_G(P)=C_G(P)$, and by the Burnside Transfer theorem, $G$ has a normal subgroup $M$ of index $p$.  Of course, any Sylow q-group of $H$ is then contained in $M$, and so $H$ is contained in $M$; that is, $H=M$ is normal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that a subgroup H of a finite group G with certain conditions must be normal. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that G is a finite group, H is a subgroup with index p, where p is a prime. Also, the gcd of the order of H and p-1 is 1. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property per object.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n- G is a finite group.\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- The index of H in G is p, where p is a prime.\n- The greatest common divisor of |H| and p−1 is 1.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that H is normal in G. \n\nWait, the original question mentions index p and gcd(|H|, p-1)=1. The example in the format had the user correct the assumptions, like adding that n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem as stated by the user doesn't seem to have incorrect assumptions. The user is asking for a quick proof given those conditions. So the task here is to filter any unrelated information and structure it properly. The title mentions \"index 2 subgroups are normal,\" which is a known result, but the actual problem is a generalization where index is a prime p with the gcd condition. So no extra assumptions need to be added beyond what's in the question. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the four assumptions as above, and the problem statement to prove H is normal.",
