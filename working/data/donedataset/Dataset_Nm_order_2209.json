    "Content": "The following is a classically valid deduction for any propositions $A,B,C$ . $\\def\\imp{\\rightarrow}$ $A \\imp B \\lor C \\vdash ( A \\imp B ) \\lor ( A \\imp C )$ . But I'm quite sure it isn't intuitionistically valid, although I don't know how to prove it, which is my first question. If my conjecture is true, my next question is what happens if we add this rule to intuitionistic logic. I do not think we will get classical logic. Is my guess right? [Edit: The user who came to close and downvote this 4 years after I asked this presumably did not see my comment: \"The BHK interpretation suggests to me that it isn't intuitionistically valid, but that's just my intuition...\". If you are not familiar with Kripke frames (and I was not at that time), good luck trying to figure out what to try!]",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Are you familiar with Kripke semantic of intuitionistic logic (see Semantics of intuitionistic logic here )? $\\def\\imp{\\rightarrow}$ Intuitively , a proposition is not interpreted as globally truth or false, but rather as the set of 'knowledge states' in which it is 'known'. Knowledge states may evolve, and the only restriction to the interpretation of propositions is that knowledge cannot be revoked. Formally , you pick a Kripke frame , i.e. a set $W$ equipped with a preorder $\\leq$ , and interpret any propositional variable as a subset of $W$ that is closed under passing to $\\leq$ -greater elements. With the interpretations of the propositional variables fixed, you interpret $\\lor$ and $\\land$ as union and intersection, respectively. Also, you interpret $\\bot$ as none of $W$ (the empty set) and $\\top$ as all of $W$ . The interesting part is the interpretation of implication: If $\\psi$ and $\\phi$ are interpreted as $A,B\\subset W$ , then $\\psi\\imp\\phi$ is interpreted as the set of states $w\\in W$ such that for any $v\\in W$ with $w\\leq v$ and $v\\in A$ , you also have $v\\in B$ . Appealing to the intuition again, it means that however knowledge evolves, whenever $\\psi$ is known then so is $\\phi$ . For example, $\\neg\\neg\\phi \\equiv ( \\phi \\imp \\bot ) \\imp \\bot$ is known at $w$ precisely if for any $v\\in W$ with $w\\leq v$ there is $z\\in W$ with $w\\leq z$ such that $\\phi$ holds at $z$ - in other words, you can never refute $\\phi$ . This is much weaker than asserting that $\\phi$ holds for all of $W$ , as you can see e.g. from the example at the end of the post, where $W = \\{0\\to 1\\}$ . Anyway, the Kripke semantics is sound for intuitionistic logic, so to prove that a formula is not an intuitionistic tautology, it suffices to provide some Kripke frame with an interpretation of the formulas' propositional variables such that the associated interpretation is not true in the whole Kripke frame. Let's do this for $(A\\imp (B\\lor C))\\imp ((A\\imp B)\\lor (A\\imp C))$ : Consider the frame $1\\leftarrow 0\\rightarrow 2$ and interpret $A$ as known only at $1,2$ , $B$ as known only at $1$ and $C$ as known only at $2$ . Then $A\\imp B$ and $A\\imp C$ are both not known at $0$ since there is an evolution which validates $A$ but does not validate $B$ (similarly $C$ ). However, $A\\imp (B\\lor C)$ is valid at $0$ , since for any evolution from $0$ to either $1$ or $2$ , either $B$ or $C$ is valid in the new state. Concerning your second question: An example like the above can only exist if the frame $W$ under consideration has branches; if, in contrast, evolution is unique - meaning formally that for any three elements $u,v,w$ in the frame satisfying $u\\leq v$ and $u\\leq w$ , we have either $v\\leq w$ or $w\\leq v$ - the formula $(A\\imp (B\\lor C))\\imp ((A\\imp B)\\lor (A\\imp C))$ does indeed hold under any interpretation. Therefore, if you add $(A\\imp (B\\lor C))\\imp ((A\\imp B)\\lor (A\\imp C))$ as an axiom to intuitionistic logic, you will still have sound Kripke semantics when restricting to frames with unique evolution. Hence, to check that a formula is not a tautology with respect to this stronger calculus, it suffices to find an interpretation in such a uniquely evolving frame which does not validate the formula. For $\\neg \\neg A$ , you can pick the frame $W = \\{0\\to 1\\}$ and interpret $A$ as known at $1$ but unknown at $0$ : Then $\\neg\\neg A$ is globally known (see above), but $A$ is not. Hence, $\\neg \\neg A \\imp A$ is not a tautology in the enhanced calculus, and therefore the enhanced calculus is still strictly contained in classical propositional logic.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about intuitionistic logic and a specific deduction. The original question is whether the classically valid deduction \\( A \\rightarrow B \\lor C \\vdash (A \\rightarrow B) \\lor (A \\rightarrow C) \\) is intuitionistically valid. If not, what happens if you add this rule to intuitionistic logic? They also suspect it doesn't result in classical logic.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the differences between classical and intuitionistic logic. Intuitionistic logic doesn't accept the law of excluded middle or double negation elimination. In terms of implications and disjunctions, the BHK interpretation says that a proof of \\( A \\rightarrow B \\lor C \\) is a method that converts proofs of A into proofs of either B or C. But crucially, in intuitionistic logic, you have to decide which disjunct you're proving, so the method must choose either B or C based on the proof of A. However, the deduction in question wants to split this into either \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) or \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), which would require that the method works for all A by converting to B in all cases or to C in all cases. But classically, you can use the law of excluded middle to say either A leads to B or not, but intuitionistically, you can't do that. So the user's intuition that it's not valid in intuitionistic logic seems right.\n\nTo show it's not intuitionistically valid, one approach is to use a Kripke model. If I can construct a Kripke model where \\( A \\rightarrow B \\lor C \\) holds at some world, but neither \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) nor \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) holds, then the disjunction \\( (A \\rightarrow B) \\lor (A \\rightarrow C) \\) would fail there. Let me try building such a model.\n\nConsider a Kripke frame with two worlds: w0 and w1, where w0 ≤ w1. Let’s set at w0: A is true, B and C are false. At w1, A is still true (if we want persistence), but maybe B becomes true, or C. Wait, but the implication has to hold at all worlds. Let me think again. Suppose at w0, A is true, but neither B nor C is true. At w1, which is accessible from w0, suppose B becomes true. Then in w0, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\lor C \\) would require that if A is true at w0, then B ∨ C must be true at all accessible worlds. But in w0, A is true, and in all accessible worlds (w0 itself and w1), B ∨ C is true at w1 (since B is true there), but in w0, B ∨ C is false. Wait, no—if the implication is at w0, then for all worlds ≥ w0 (i.e., w0 and w1), if A holds at that world, then B ∨ C must hold there. So in w0, A holds, so B ∨ C must hold at w0. But in w0, B and C are false, so that's a problem. So maybe my initial model is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have a model where A is not forced at the root, but is forced at a higher node. Let's say we have three worlds: w0 ≤ w1 and w0 ≤ w2. At w1, A is true and B is true. At w2, A is true and C is true. At w0, A is not forced. Then, in w0, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\lor C \\) would hold because in any world ≥ w0 where A holds (i.e., w1 or w2), B ∨ C holds. However, in w0, neither \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) nor \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) holds. Because at w1, A→B holds (since B is true there), but at w2, A→C holds. But in w0, to have \\( (A \\rightarrow B) \\lor (A \\rightarrow C) \\), we would need that in all worlds ≥ w0, either A→B or A→C holds. But in w1, A→B holds, and in w2, A→C holds. However, the disjunction in intuitionistic logic requires that at the same world, one of them holds. Wait, no. In Kripke semantics, a disjunction holds at a world if either of the disjuncts holds at that world. So in w0, for \\( (A \\rightarrow B) \\lor (A \\rightarrow C) \\) to hold, either \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) must hold at w0 or \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) must hold at w0. \n\nBut \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) holds at w0 if, for all worlds ≥ w0 (w0, w1, w2), if A holds there, then B holds there. But in w2, A holds but B does not (since in w2, C is true). So \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not hold at w0. Similarly, \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) would require that in all worlds ≥ w0 where A holds, C holds. But in w1, A holds but C does not. Hence, neither disjunct holds at w0, so the disjunction doesn't hold. However, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\lor C \\) does hold at w0 because in any world where A holds (w1, w2), B∨C holds (B in w1, C in w2). Therefore, this model shows that \\( A \\rightarrow B \\lor C \\) does not intuitionistically entail \\( (A \\rightarrow B) \\lor (A \\rightarrow C) \\).\n\nThus, the deduction is not intuitionistically valid. \n\nNow, the second part: if we add this rule to intuitionistic logic, do we get classical logic? The user guesses no. Let's see. Adding this axiom might not be enough to derive all classical tautologies. For example, the law of excluded middle \\( A \\lor \\neg A \\) isn't directly derivable from this. To check, suppose we have this axiom. Let’s see if we can derive LEM. Let me try plugging in B = A and C = ¬A. Then \\( A \\rightarrow A \\lor \\neg A \\) is an intuitionistic tautology. By the added rule, we would get \\( (A → A) ∨ (A → ¬A) \\). Since \\( A → A \\) is always true, this disjunction holds. But \\( (A → A) ∨ (A → ¬A) \\) is equivalent (in classical logic) to just true ∨ something, which is true, but in intuitionistic logic, does this help? Well, \\( A → A \\) is trivial, so the disjunction holds, but that doesn't give us \\( A ∨ ¬A \\). Wait, no. The disjunction here is about implications. So having \\( (A → A) ∨ (A → ¬A) \\) doesn't directly give us LEM. Even if we have this, we can't necessarily get A ∨ ¬A. Therefore, adding this rule might not collapse to classical logic. Hence, the user's guess is likely correct that adding this rule doesn't result in classical logic.\n\nAnother way to check is to see if adding this rule allows deriving something like Peirce's law, which with the other axioms gives classical logic. But I don't see a direct path from this rule to Peirce's law. So probably, the resulting system is an intermediate logic between intuitionistic and classical.",
