    "Content": "Suppose that there are given two distance functions $d(x,y)$ and $d_1 (x,y)$ on the same space $S$. They are said to be equivalent if they determine the same open sets. Show that $d$ and $d_1$ are equivalent if to every $\\varepsilon$ there exists a $\\delta>0$ such that $d(x,y)<\\delta$ implies $d_1 (x,y)<\\varepsilon$ and vice versa.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since open sets are the sums of open balls, it suffices to check if those metrices determine the same open balls.\nLet us denote by $B_d(x,r)$ an open (wrt $d$) ball with a centre in $x\\in S$ and a radius $r\\gt0$, i.e. $B_d(x,r)=\\{y\\in S\\mid d(x,y)<r\\}$. We will prove an arbitrary open ball $B_d(x_0,r)$ is $d_1$-open. In order to do that, we will show that for every $x\\in B_d(x_0,r)$ there exists $r_x$ such that $B_{d_1}(x,r_x)\\subset B_d(x_0,r)$. What we have is $$(*)\\quad\\forall_{a\\in S} \\forall_{\\varepsilon>0}\\exists_{\\delta>0}\\forall_{b\\in S}\\ \\ d_1(a,b)\\lt\\delta\\implies d(a,b)\\lt\\varepsilon.$$\n(our $a$ is actually $x$ and $\\delta$ will be desired $r_x$.) As has been said, fix an arbitrary $x\\in B_d(x_0,r), x\\neq x_0$ and set $\\varepsilon=\\min{(d(x,x_0),r-d(x,x_0))}>0.$ From $(*)$ we know that there exists $\\delta>0$ such that for all $y\\in S$ $$(1)\\quad d(x,y)<\\min{(d(x,x_0),r-d(x,x_0))}\\le r-d(x,x_0)$$\nas long as $d_1(x,y)\\lt\\delta$. Now we could reformulate (1) by adding $d(x,x_0)$ to both sides and applying triangle inequality:\n$$d(x_0,y)<d(x,y)+d(x,x_0)<r.$$\nThus, what we proved is:\n$$\\forall_{x\\in B_d(x_0,r)}\\exists_{\\delta>0} \\forall_{y\\in S}\\ y\\in B_{d_1}(x,\\delta) \\implies y\\in B_d(x_0,r)$$\nand, in other words, it means that every $x\\neq x_0$ from $d$-ball is contained there with some small $d_1$-ball, that is $d$-ball is open in the sense of metric $d_1$. For $x_0$, the existence of such $d_1$-ball is ensured by $(*)$ directly (take $\\varepsilon=r)$. Entirely analogously, one can prove second part of the problem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about showing that two metrics d and d1 on the same space S are equivalent if certain conditions involving epsilon and delta hold. The equivalence here means they determine the same topology, i.e., the same open sets. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for two metrics to be equivalent in terms of topology. Two metrics are equivalent if they generate the same collection of open sets. That means every open set in the topology generated by d is also open in the topology generated by d1 and vice versa. \n\nThe problem states that to prove this equivalence, we need to show that for every epsilon, there exists a delta such that d(x,y) < delta implies d1(x,y) < epsilon, and vice versa. So, the condition is a mutual one: both directions of implication between the two metrics.\n\nLet me think about how open sets in a metric space are defined. An open set U in a metric space (S, d) is a set where for every point x in U, there exists some epsilon > 0 such that the ball B_d(x, epsilon) = { y in S | d(x,y) < epsilon } is entirely contained in U. Similarly for d1.\n\nTo show that the topologies are the same, we need to show that every d-open set is d1-open and vice versa. Let's take a d-open set U and show it's d1-open. Take any x in U. Since U is d-open, there's an epsilon > 0 such that B_d(x, epsilon) is in U. But we need to find a delta > 0 such that B_d1(x, delta) is contained in U. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if we want to show that U is d1-open, then for each x in U, we need to find a delta such that B_d1(x, delta) is contained in U. But how does the condition given relate to this?\n\nThe given condition says that for every epsilon, there exists a delta such that d(x,y) < delta implies d1(x,y) < epsilon, and vice versa. This seems like a condition that the identity map from (S, d) to (S, d1) is uniformly continuous, and vice versa. But maybe more directly, it's about the equivalence of the metrics in terms of convergence, but here we need to connect it to open sets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that two metrics are equivalent (in the topological sense) if and only if they induce the same notion of convergence. But the problem gives a specific condition, so perhaps we should use that condition to show that every d-open ball contains a d1-open ball around each point, and vice versa. That would imply that the topologies are the same.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose we have two metrics d and d1. To show they generate the same topology, we need to show that for any x in S, any d-open ball around x contains a d1-open ball around x, and vice versa.\n\nGiven the condition in the problem: for every epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that d(x,y) < delta implies d1(x,y) < epsilon. Similarly, the reverse: for every epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that d1(x,y) < delta implies d(x,y) < epsilon.\n\nSo, let's take a d-open set U. For any x in U, there's an epsilon such that B_d(x, epsilon) is in U. We need to find a delta such that B_d1(x, delta) is contained in B_d(x, epsilon), which would then be in U. But how does the given condition help here?\n\nWait, the given condition is that for any epsilon, there's a delta such that d(x,y) < delta implies d1(x,y) < epsilon. Wait, that's like saying that the identity map from (S, d) to (S, d1) is uniformly continuous. Similarly, the other direction gives that the identity map the other way is uniformly continuous. But uniform continuity implies continuity, and if both identity maps are continuous in both directions, then they are homeomorphisms, hence the topologies are the same.\n\nBut maybe the problem wants a more direct approach. Let's try to show that every d-open set is d1-open. Take U as d-open. Let x be in U. Then there's epsilon > 0 such that B_d(x, epsilon) ⊂ U. By the given condition (from d to d1), for this epsilon, there's a delta > 0 such that d(x,y) < delta implies d1(x,y) < epsilon. Wait, but we need to find a d1-ball around x contained in U. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the other direction. Suppose we want to show that B_d1(x, delta) is contained in B_d(x, epsilon). To do that, we need that if d1(x,y) < delta, then d(x,y) < epsilon. Which is exactly the reverse condition given in the problem: for any epsilon, there exists delta such that d1(x,y) < delta implies d(x,y) < epsilon. Similarly, the forward condition allows us to go from d to d1.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Let's say we have the two conditions:\n\n1. For every ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0 such that d(x,y) < δ ⇒ d1(x,y) < ε.\n\n2. For every ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0 such that d1(x,y) < δ ⇒ d(x,y) < ε.\n\nThese two conditions are given. Now, to show that the topologies are the same, we need to show that every open set in d is open in d1 and vice versa.\n\nTake an open set U in (S, d). Let x ∈ U. Then ∃ ε > 0 such that B_d(x, ε) ⊆ U. Now, by condition 1 (from d to d1), for this ε, there exists δ > 0 such that if d(x,y) < δ, then d1(x,y) < ε. Wait, but we need to find a d1-ball around x contained in U. So perhaps using condition 2 here.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the directions. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a d-open set U. To show it's d1-open, take any x in U. There exists ε > 0 such that B_d(x, ε) ⊆ U. Now, by condition 1 (from d to d1), for this ε, there exists δ > 0 such that d(x,y) < δ ⇒ d1(x,y) < ε. But this means that B_d(x, δ) ⊆ B_d1(x, ε). Wait, no. If d(x,y) < δ ⇒ d1(x,y) < ε, then B_d(x, δ) is contained in B_d1(x, ε). Therefore, B_d1(x, ε) contains B_d(x, δ). But we need the other way around: to find a d1-ball around x contained in B_d(x, ε). Wait, no. Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem is to show that U is d1-open. So we need to find a δ such that B_d1(x, δ) ⊆ U. Since we know B_d(x, ε) ⊆ U, if we can find a δ such that B_d1(x, δ) ⊆ B_d(x, ε), then that δ would work. So how to get B_d1(x, δ) ⊆ B_d(x, ε)? That would require that whenever d1(x,y) < δ, then d(x,y) < ε. Which is exactly condition 2. Because for ε, condition 2 gives us a δ such that d1(x,y) < δ ⇒ d(x,y) < ε. Therefore, B_d1(x, δ) ⊆ B_d(x, ε) ⊆ U. Hence, U is d1-open.\n\nSimilarly, take a d1-open set V. For any x in V, there's ε > 0 such that B_d1(x, ε) ⊆ V. Using condition 1, for this ε, there exists δ > 0 such that d(x,y) < δ ⇒ d1(x,y) < ε. Therefore, B_d(x, δ) ⊆ B_d1(x, ε) ⊆ V. Hence, V is d-open.\n\nTherefore, the two conditions given ensure that each open set in one topology is open in the other, hence they are equivalent.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Use the given mutual conditions to show that every d-open ball contains a d1-open ball and vice versa.\n\n2. Therefore, the open sets in each topology are the same.\n\nTherefore, the problem requires structuring the assumptions properly. The original problem states that two metrics are equivalent (same open sets) if the given epsilon-delta conditions hold. The assumptions should list the conditions given. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nOriginal question:\n\n\"Suppose that there are given two distance functions $d(x,y)$ and $d_1 (x,y)$ on the same space $S$. They are said to be equivalent if they determine the same open sets. Show that $d$ and $d_1$ are equivalent if to every $\\varepsilon$ there exists a $\\delta>0$ such that $d(x,y)<\\delta$ implies $d_1 (x,y)<\\varepsilon$ and vice versa.\"\n\nWait, the problem says \"Show that $d$ and $d_1$ are equivalent if to every $\\varepsilon$ there exists a $\\delta>0$ such that $d(x,y)<\\delta$ implies $d_1 (x,y)<\\varepsilon$ and vice versa.\"\n\nThe \"and vice versa\" here probably means that also for every ε, there exists δ such that d1(x,y) < δ implies d(x,y) < ε. So the two conditions are:\n\nFor every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that d(x,y) < δ ⇒ d1(x,y) < ε.\n\nAND\n\nFor every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that d1(x,y) < δ ⇒ d(x,y) < ε.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem are:\n\n- $d$ and $d_1$ are distance functions on the same space $S$.\n\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d_1(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d_1(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut the problem says \"Show that $d$ and $d_1$ are equivalent if [these conditions hold]\". So the task is to prove equivalence under these conditions.\n\nThus, structuring the problem as per the given format:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $d$ and $d_1$ are distance functions on the same space $S$.\n\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d_1(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d_1(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that $d$ and $d_1$ determine the same open sets (i.e., are equivalent metrics).\n\nBut the example given in the user's example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So in this case, each of the two epsilon-delta conditions would be separate assumptions, along with the fact that both are distance functions on S.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"given two distance functions d and d1 on the same space S\". So that's another assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. $d$ is a distance function on $S$.\n\n2. $d_1$ is a distance function on $S$.\n\n3. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d_1(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\n4. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d_1(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is just taking the metrics as given on the same space, and the two epsilon-delta conditions. Alternatively, maybe the first assumption is that $d$ and $d_1$ are metrics on the same space, then the next two are the conditions.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the assumptions were:\n\n- $n$ is an integer,\n\n- $n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption is a single condition on a single object. Here, similarly, each condition should be separate.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$d$ and $d_1$ are distance functions on the same space $S$,\n\nFor every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d_1(x,y) < \\varepsilon$,\n\nFor every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d_1(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut wait, in the user's example, each assumption is a separate line. So probably:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$d$ is a distance function on $S$,\n\n$d_1$ is a distance function on $S$,\n\nFor every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d_1(x,y) < \\varepsilon$,\n\nFor every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d_1(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut maybe the first two can be combined since they are both on the same space. But according to the example, each assumption is one property. The example had two separate lines: one that n is an integer, another that n is divisible by 7. Here, \"d and d1 are distance functions on S\" is one condition. Alternatively, perhaps split into each being a metric. But the problem states \"two distance functions... on the same space S\". So perhaps as:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$d$ and $d_1$ are distance functions on the same space $S$,\n\nFor every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d_1(x,y) < \\varepsilon$,\n\nFor every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d_1(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\nThat would be three assumptions. The first establishes that both metrics are on S, the next two are the mutual epsilon-delta conditions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$d$ and $d_1$ are distance functions on the same space $S$,\n\nFor every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d_1(x,y) < \\varepsilon$,\n\nFor every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $d_1(x,y) < \\delta$ implies $d(x,y) < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that $d$ and $d_1$ determine the same open sets (i.e., are equivalent metrics).\n\nBut the original problem's title mentions \"Equivalent metrics determine the same topology\", and the problem statement says \"Show that d and d1 are equivalent if...\". So the problem is to show the equivalence (same open sets) given those two epsilon-delta conditions.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should look like that.",
