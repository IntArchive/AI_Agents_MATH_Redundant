    "Content": "This question is a follow-up of this one . Now I'm trying to prove that the torsion submodule of $\\prod \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is not a direct summand of $\\prod \\mathbb{Z}_p$. I found this interesting because it's an example that over a PID, a non-finitely generated module may fail to be decomposed as torsion $\\oplus$ something free, showing even that it can't be decomposed as torsion $\\oplus$ anything. Now, it is easily proven that the torsion submodule of $\\prod \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is $\\bigoplus \\mathbb{Z}_p$. So if we could decompose $\\prod \\mathbb{Z}_p$ as torsion $\\oplus$ something it would have to be $\\prod \\mathbb{Z}_p = \\bigoplus \\mathbb{Z}_p \\oplus \\frac{\\prod \\mathbb{Z}_p}{\\bigoplus \\mathbb{Z}_p}$ (this is correct, right?) Now, using the question linked above, we know the right summand is divisible ($\\iff$ injective), besides it is torsion-free ($\\iff$ flat). (I think) I've learned my lesson from my previous question, so I also tried proving that there is a member in $\\prod \\mathbb{Z}_p$ which can't be written as a sum of something in $\\bigoplus \\mathbb{Z}_p$ plus something in $\\frac{\\prod \\mathbb{Z}_p}{\\bigoplus \\mathbb{Z}_p}$, but I couldn't advance any further in this direction either.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $G=\\prod_p\\Bbb Z_p$ and $H=\\bigoplus_p\\Bbb Z_p$ and regard $H$\nas a subgroup of $G$. You want to know if $H$ is a direct factor\nof $G$. If it was there would be a subgroup $K$ of $G$\nisomorphic to $G/H$. There isn't. You know that $G/H$\nis divisible, but there are no nonzero elements $x\\in G$ having the property that\n$x=p y$ for some $y\\in G$ for all primes $p$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe title is \"The torsion submodule of ∏ℤ_p is not a direct summand of ∏ℤ_p\". The question is a follow-up to a previous one. The main goal is to prove that the torsion submodule of the product ∏ℤ_p isn't a direct summand. \n\nFrom the problem description, the user mentions that the torsion submodule is already known to be ⊕ℤ_p. They then consider a potential decomposition ∏ℤ_p = ⊕ℤ_p ⊕ (∏ℤ_p / ⊕ℤ_p) and note that the quotient module ∏ℤ_p / ⊕ℤ_p is divisible (hence injective) and torsion-free (hence flat). However, despite these properties, they couldn't establish the decomposition and are stuck.\n\nI need to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The assumptions should list each individual condition. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions would include:\n- The module in question is the product ∏ℤ_p over primes p.\n- The torsion submodule of ∏ℤ_p is ⊕ℤ_p (the direct sum).\n- The quotient module ∏ℤ_p / ⊕ℤ_p is divisible.\n- The quotient module ∏ℤ_p / ⊕ℤ_p is torsion-free.\n- The problem is set over a PID (since the user mentions it's an example over a PID).\n\nWait, the original problem states that over a PID, a non-finitely generated module might not decompose into torsion and free parts. But the key assumptions here are about the specific modules involved: the product and its torsion submodule.\n\nBut the actual problem to be proven is that the torsion submodule (which is the direct sum) is not a direct summand of the product. So the assumptions are the properties given in the problem statement that are taken as given or known.\n\nWait, the user says \"it is easily proven that the torsion submodule of ∏ℤ_p is ⊕ℤ_p\". So that's a known fact here. So that's an assumption. Also, they are working over a PID (since the user mentions it's an example over a PID). However, the problem is about modules over a PID, but the specific ring here is ℤ, which is a PID. But maybe the problem is general over a PID? Wait, the modules here are products of ℤ_p, which are ℤ-modules. So the context is modules over ℤ (a PID). \n\nSo the Assumptions would be:\n\n- Let R be the ring of integers ℤ (a PID).\n- Let M = ∏_{p prime} ℤ_p (the product of ℤ_p over all primes p).\n- The torsion submodule T of M is ⊕_{p prime} ℤ_p (the direct sum).\n- T is a submodule of M.\n- The quotient module M/T is divisible.\n- The quotient module M/T is torsion-free.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"Prove that the torsion submodule of ∏ℤ_p is not a direct summand of ∏ℤ_p\". The user mentions that they know the torsion submodule is the direct sum. So the key assumptions are that T = ⊕ℤ_p is the torsion submodule of M = ∏ℤ_p, and that M is a module over a PID. The problem is to show T is not a direct summand of M.\n\nHowever, the example given in the user's previous example had assumptions listed as properties of the objects in the problem. In that example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be the setup of the problem: defining the product, the torsion submodule as the direct sum, etc.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nM is the product of ℤ_p over all primes p,\nT is the torsion submodule of M,\nT is equal to the direct sum of ℤ_p over all primes p,\nM is a module over ℤ (a PID),\nThe quotient module M/T is divisible,\nThe quotient module M/T is torsion-free.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is just to prove that T is not a direct summand of M, given that T is the torsion submodule. The other information (about the quotient being divisible and torsion-free) might be part of the user's attempt or context but not necessarily assumptions. The key assumptions are the definitions: M is the product, T is its torsion submodule (which is the direct sum). The problem is to show T is not a direct summand of M.\n\nTherefore, the problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let M = ∏_{p prime} ℤ_p,\n- Let T be the torsion submodule of M,\n- T = ⊕_{p prime} ℤ_p.\n\nProblem:\nProve that T is not a direct summand of M.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions \"the torsion submodule of ∏ℤ_p is not a direct summand of ∏ℤ_p\". So perhaps the problem is just that: Prove that the torsion submodule T of M = ∏ℤ_p is not a direct summand of M. The assumptions are the given definitions of M and T.\n\nThe user's own steps, like considering M = T ⊕ (M/T), and noting that M/T is divisible and torsion-free, are part of their approach but not part of the problem's assumptions. So in the problem formatting, the assumptions should be the given conditions, not the user's reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nM is the product of ℤ_p over all primes p,\nT is the torsion submodule of M,\nT is equal to the direct sum of ℤ_p over all primes p.\n\nProblem:\nProve that T is not a direct summand of M.\n\nThe other parts about the quotient being divisible or torsion-free are perhaps properties that the user is using in their attempt, but they aren't assumptions given in the problem. The problem itself is to show that T is not a direct summand, given that T is the torsion submodule (which is the direct sum). So those three assumptions would be the setup.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should have:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$M$ is the product of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ over all primes $p$,\n$T$ is the torsion submodule of $M$,\n$T$ is equal to the direct sum of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ over all primes $p$.\nProblem:\nProve that $T$ is not a direct summand of $M$.\n###\n\nI need to check if the example given by the user includes any context beyond the problem's own assumptions. In their example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, in the original problem, the user had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" but the formatted problem only had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that example seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem has \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. But in the given example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. So maybe the correct assumption is that n is an integer, and then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example was wrong. Hmm, that might complicate things, but in this current problem, we need to stick to the actual problem's assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is trying to prove that T is not a direct summand. The problem's own setup is M is the product, T is its torsion submodule (which is the direct sum). So the assumptions are those three points. Hence, the formatted problem would be as above.",
