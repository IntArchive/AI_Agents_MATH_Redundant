    "Content": "Morandi's Field and Galois Theory, exercise 5.19b Let $K$ and $L$ be Galois extensions of $F$ . The restriction of function map, namely, $\\sigma\\mapsto(\\sigma\\vert_K,\\sigma\\vert_L)$ induces an injective group homomorphism $\\varphi\\colon\\operatorname{Gal}(KL/F)\\to\\operatorname{Gal}(K/F)\\times\\operatorname{Gal}(L/F)$ . Show that $\\varphi$ is surjective if and only if $K\\cap L=F$ . It's not hard to show that $\\varphi$ is a monomorphism. If it's surjective, it's not hard to show that $K\\cap L=F$ as follow: Fix $\\alpha\\in K\\cap L$ , let $\\beta$ be a root of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $F$ . Since $K,L$ are normal, $\\beta\\in K\\cap L$ . By isomorphism extension theorem, we can choose $\\tau_1\\in\\operatorname{Gal}(K/F)$ such that $\\tau_1(\\alpha)=\\beta$ . For surjectivity of the map, there's $\\sigma$ such that $\\sigma\\vert_K=\\tau_1$ and $\\sigma_L=\\mathrm{id}$ , which forces $\\alpha=\\beta$ , therefore $\\alpha\\in F$ , since $K,L$ are separable over $F$ . The converse seems hard. I cannot show that when $K,L$ are arbitrary Galois extensions. If they are both finite dimensional, the statement follows from natural irrationality: $\\operatorname{Gal}(KL/L)\\cong\\operatorname{Gal}(K/K\\cap L)$ , which implies that $[KL:L]=[K:K\\cap L]=[K:F]$ , therefore $[KL:F]=[K:F][L:F]$ , and note that $\\varphi$ is injective, thus surjective. Any help? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We need the following lemma. Lemma Let $K/F$ be a (not necessarily finite dimensional) Galois extension, $L/F$ an arbitrary extension.\nClearly $KL/L$ is Galois.\nThen the restriction map, namely, $\\sigma\\mapsto \\sigma\\mid K$ induces\nan isomorphism $\\psi\\colon \\mathrm{Gal}(KL/L) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Gal}(K/K\\cap L)$ . Proof. We regard $\\mathrm{Gal}(KL/L)$ and $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/K\\cap L)$ as topological groups with Krull topologies.\nClearly $\\psi$ is continuous and injective.\nLet $H = \\psi(\\mathrm{Gal}(KL/L))$ .\nSince $\\mathrm{Gal}(KL/L)$ is compact, $H$ is also compact.\nSince $\\mathrm{Gal}(K/K\\cap L)$ is Hausdorff, $H$ is closed.\nClearly the fixed subfield of $K$ by $H$ is $K \\cap L$ .\nHence $H = \\mathrm{Gal}(K/K\\cap L)$ by the fundamental theorem of (not necessarily finite dimensional) Galois theory.\nThis completes the proof. Now we prove the following proposition with which the OP had a problem. Proposition Let $K$ and $L$ be Galois extensions of $F$ .\nThe restriction of function map, namely, $\\sigma\\mapsto(\\sigma\\vert_K,\\sigma\\vert_L)$ induces a group homomorphism $\\varphi\\colon\\operatorname{Gal}(KL/F)\\to\\operatorname{Gal}(K/F)\\times\\operatorname{Gal}(L/F)$ . Suppose $K\\cap L=F$ . Then $\\varphi$ is an isomorphism. Proof. Since it is clear that $\\varphi$ is injective, it suffices to prove that it is surjective.\nLet $G_1 = \\mathrm{Gal}(K/F), G_2 = \\mathrm{Gal}(L/F), G = \\mathrm{Gal}(KL/F)$ .\nBy the lemma, given $\\sigma_1 \\in G_1$ , there exists $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(KL/L)$ such that $\\sigma\\mid K = \\sigma_1$ . Since $\\sigma \\in G$ and $\\sigma\\mid L = 1_L$ , $G_1\\times 1 \\subset \\varphi(G)$ .\nSimilarly $1\\times G_2 \\subset \\varphi(G)$ .\nHence $G_1\\times G_2 = \\varphi(G)$ .\nThis completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and present the problem with clear assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, looking at the original question. The title is about the Galois group of a composite of Galois extensions. The user mentions exercise 5.19b from Morandi's book. The problem involves showing that a certain group homomorphism φ between Galois groups is surjective if and only if the intersection of K and L is F. \n\nIn the problem description, the user already outlines some parts of their attempt. They mention that they can show one direction (if φ is surjective, then K ∩ L = F) but the converse is challenging. They also discuss the case when the extensions are finite-dimensional and use natural irrationality. However, the question is about arbitrary Galois extensions, not necessarily finite.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions here are related to the conditions given in the problem. The problem states that K and L are Galois extensions of F. The homomorphism φ is defined by restricting σ to K and L. The goal is to show that φ is surjective if and only if K ∩ L = F.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are:\n1. K is a Galois extension of F.\n2. L is a Galois extension of F.\n3. The homomorphism φ: Gal(KL/F) → Gal(K/F) × Gal(L/F) is defined by restriction maps.\n\nThe problem is to show that φ is surjective if and only if K ∩ L = F.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user mentions that K and L are Galois over F. So the assumptions should include that K and L are Galois extensions of F. Also, the homomorphism φ is given by the restriction maps. The problem is the equivalence between φ being surjective and K ∩ L = F.\n\nIn the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So here, each assumption would be:\n\n- K is a Galois extension of F.\n- L is a Galois extension of F.\n- The homomorphism φ: Gal(KL/F) → Gal(K/F) × Gal(L/F) is induced by restricting automorphisms to K and L.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't state any other conditions except that K and L are Galois over F, and we are to prove the surjectivity condition in terms of their intersection. The original problem statement in the user's post is: \"Show that φ is surjective if and only if K ∩ L = F.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. K is a Galois extension of F.\n2. L is a Galois extension of F.\n3. The map φ: Gal(KL/F) → Gal(K/F) × Gal(L/F) is defined by σ ↦ (σ|_K, σ|_L).\n\nThe problem is to show that φ is surjective if and only if K ∩ L = F.\n\nNow, checking if the assumptions are correctly isolated. Each assumption is a single property. The first two are about K and L being Galois over F. The third is about the definition of the homomorphism φ.\n\nThe problem statement is exactly the equivalence between φ being surjective and the intersection being F. So that should be the problem line.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other hidden assumptions. The user mentions in their attempt that if the extensions are finite-dimensional, then the result follows from natural irrationality. But the problem is for arbitrary Galois extensions, possibly infinite. However, the problem statement as given in the exercise doesn't specify finite, so the assumptions should remain as K and L being Galois over F, regardless of dimension.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a Galois extension of F,\nL is a Galois extension of F,\nThe homomorphism φ: Gal(KL/F) → Gal(K/F) × Gal(L/F) is defined by σ ↦ (σ|_K, σ|_L).\nProblem:\nShow that φ is surjective if and only if K ∩ L = F.\n\nWait, but the original problem mentions that φ is induced by the restriction maps. So the third assumption is about the definition of φ.\n\nYes, that's correct. Each assumption is separate. The first two are about K and L being Galois over F, and the third is about the definition of the homomorphism. Then the problem is the equivalence.\n\nI think that's all. The user's question is about structuring the problem, so the answer should list these assumptions and the problem statement.",
