    "Content": "A finite dimensional commutative algebra is\na finite product of commutative local algebras. Why? In fact, every commutative semiperfect ring is a basic ring and isomorphic to a finite product of local rings, but I do not how to prove it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A slightly different proof than that of rschwieb. Let $R$ be a finite dimensional commutative artinian algebra. $R$ has only finitely many maximal ideals. Let $n$ be the dimension of $R$. If $m_1, \\dots, m_r$ are distinct maximal ideals of $R$, then by Chinese Remainder Theorem, the canonical map\n$$ R\\to R/m_1\\oplus \\cdots \\oplus R/m_r$$ \nis surjective. This imples implies that $r\\le n$. So $R$ has only finitely many maximal ideals. Let $m_1, \\dots, m_q$ be the maximal ideals of $R$. For some $N\\ge 1$, $(m_1m_2\\dots m_q)^N=0$. The decreasing sequence of ideals $(m_1m_2\\dots m_q)^N$ is stationary. For some $N\\ge 1$, we have \n$$ (m_1m_2\\dots m_q)^N=(m_1m_2\\dots m_q).(m_1m_2\\dots m_q)^N.$$\nBy Nakayama's lemma, this implies that $(m_1m_2\\dots m_q)^N=0$. End of proof. Let $N$ be as above. Again by CRT, we have \n$$ R\\simeq \\oplus_{1\\le i\\le q} R/m_i^N.$$ \nNow $R/m_i^N$ is local because its only maximal ideal is the image of $m_i$ in $R/m_i^N$. Remark. The same proof works similarly if $R$ is not an algebra over a field, but has finite length.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help the user structure this math problem according to their specified format. Let me start by understanding the original question. The user is asking why a finite-dimensional commutative algebra is a finite product of commutative local algebras. They also mention that every commutative semiperfect ring is a basic ring and isomorphic to a finite product of local rings, but they don't know how to prove it.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The key points here are:\n\n1. The algebra is finite-dimensional. This is important because finite-dimensional algebras have certain properties, like being Artinian, which can lead to decomposition theorems.\n2. The algebra is commutative. Commutativity is crucial because it allows the use of structure theorems that might not hold in the non-commutative case.\n3. The problem is about decomposing this algebra into a product of local algebras. Local algebras have a unique maximal ideal, so the goal is to break down the algebra into simpler, local components.\n\nThe original question mentions semiperfect rings, but the main problem seems to focus on finite-dimensional commutative algebras. The user might have conflated two related concepts here: semiperfect rings and finite-dimensional algebras. Since the user wants the problem structured, I should focus on the finite-dimensional commutative algebra part, as that's the primary question.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each property one by one. Each assumption should apply to one object, which in this case is the algebra. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The algebra is finite-dimensional.\n- The algebra is commutative.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that this algebra is a finite product of commutative local algebras. \n\nI need to make sure there's no extra information. The mention of semiperfect rings and basic rings in the original question is additional context but not part of the core problem the user wants structured. So filtering that out, the structured problem should include the two key assumptions and then the problem statement about decomposing into local algebras.\n\nLet me double-check the example provided. The example took the original problem, listed assumptions (integer n, n divisible by 7), then stated the problem. Similarly, here, the assumptions are the properties of the algebra (finite-dimensional, commutative), and the problem is the decomposition.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe algebra is finite-dimensional,\nThe algebra is commutative.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a finite dimensional commutative algebra is a finite product of commutative local algebras.\n\nYes, that seems to capture the essence. The semiperfect ring part is additional information not needed for the problem structure as per the user's example. So I'll present it in the required format.",
