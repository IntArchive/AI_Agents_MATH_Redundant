    "Content": "I've been having some difficulty trying to prove this exercise in $\\textit{Complex Analysis}$ by Gamelin: Let $\\{z_k\\}$ be a sequence of distinct points in a domain $D$ that accumulates at the boundary $\\partial D$ and let $E$ be a closed subset of the extended complex plane $\\mathbb{C} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$. Show that there is an analytic function $f(z)$ on $D$ such that $E$ is the set of cluster values of $f$ along the sequence $\\{z_k\\}$. Now there is a theorem that states that there is an analytic function $f(z)$ on the open unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ whose radial cluster set at any $\\zeta \\in \\partial \\mathbb{D}$ coincides with the entire complex plane. In the exercise couldn't I just let $D= \\mathbb{D}$, and somehow work from there using this theorem? I'd appreciate some input here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We can show rather more than what you ask for. Let $z_k$ be a sequence of distinct points in an open subset $D$ of the extended complex plane $\\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$, accumulating at the boundary $\\partial D$. Let $a_k$ be a sequence in $\\mathbb{C}$. Then, there is an analytic function $f$ on $D$ such that $f(z_k)=a_k$ for all $k$. As any (nonempty!) closed subset of the extended complex plane is the set of cluster points of some sequence $a_k\\in\\mathbb{C}$, this gives what you ask. To prove my claim, we can start by applying a Möbius transformation , if necessary, to transform the domain so that $\\infty\\in D$. Then, $\\partial D$ is a compact subset of $\\mathbb{C}$. Choose a sequence $y_k\\in\\partial D$ so that $\\Vert z_k-y_k\\Vert\\to0$. The idea is to construct a function of the form\n$$\nf(z)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_k(z-z_1)(z-z_2)\\cdots(z-z_{k-1})\\frac{(z_k-y_k)^{n_k}}{(z-y_k)^{n_k}}\n$$\nwhere $c_k\\in\\mathbb{C}$ and $n_k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ are sequences which I will describe now. (Note, we will have $n_k\\ge k-1$ whenever $c_k\\not=0$, so that each of the terms in the sum is defined at $\\infty$.) Consider the partial sums,\n$$\nf_m(z)=\\sum_{k=1}^m c_k(z-z_1)(z-z_2)\\cdots(z-z_{k-1})\\frac{(z_k-y_k)^{n_k}}{(z-y_k)^{n_k}}.\n$$\nIf we have already chosen $c_k,n_k$ for $k < m$ such that $f_{m-1}(z_k)=a_k$ (all $k < m$), then it is automatically true that $f_m(z_k)=a_k$ (all $k < m$). There is also a unique choice for $c_m$ such that $f_m(z_m)=a_m$.\nFurthermore, the value of $c_m$ does not depend on how we choose $n_m$. Next, the term\n$$\nc_m(z-z_1)(z-z_2)\\cdots(z-z_{m-1})\\frac{(z_m-y_m)^{n_m}}{(z-y_m)^{n_m}}\n$$\nconverges uniformly to zero on the set $S_m=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}\\colon\\Vert z-y_m\\Vert\\ge2\\Vert z_m-y_m\\Vert\\}$ in the limit $n_m\\to\\infty$. So, choosing $n_m$ large enough, we can suppose that this term is bounded by $2^{-m}$ on $S_m$. We are now done. Every closed subset of $\\mathbb{C}$ disjoint from $\\partial D$ will be in $S_m$ for large $m$, so the sum defining $f$ converges uniformly on compacts in $D$ and $f$ is a well-defined analytic function. By construction, $f_m(z_k)=a_k$ for all $m\\ge k$, so $f(z_k)=a_k$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with Assumptions and Problem. First, I need to parse the original question carefully.\n\nThe original question is about proving that there exists an analytic function f(z) on a domain D such that a closed subset E of the extended complex plane is the set of cluster values of f along a sequence {z_k} in D that accumulates at the boundary ∂D. The user is referencing a theorem about the existence of such a function on the unit disk with radial cluster sets covering the entire complex plane and wonders if they can apply that theorem by taking D as the unit disk.\n\nNow, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The user mentions a specific theorem related to the unit disk and radial cluster sets, but the problem as stated is more general—it's for any domain D and a closed subset E. However, the user's thought process about using the theorem for D=𝔻 might be part of their approach, but in structuring the problem, we should focus on the actual problem's assumptions and statement.\n\nLooking at the problem statement in the question: We have a domain D, a sequence {z_k} of distinct points in D accumulating at ∂D, and a closed subset E of the extended complex plane. We need to show there exists an analytic function f on D such that E is the cluster set of f along {z_k}.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n1. D is a domain (open and connected).\n2. {z_k} is a sequence of distinct points in D.\n3. The sequence {z_k} accumulates at the boundary ∂D (i.e., has no limit points inside D, so it approaches the boundary).\n4. E is a closed subset of the extended complex plane ℂ∪{∞}.\n\nThe problem is to show the existence of an analytic function f on D with E as the cluster set along {z_k}.\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't specify any particular conditions on D other than being a domain. The user's example with the unit disk is a specific case, but the problem is general. So the assumptions should list all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, structuring it:\n\nAssumption: D is a domain,\nAssumption: {z_k} is a sequence of distinct points in D,\nAssumption: {z_k} accumulates at ∂D,\nAssumption: E is a closed subset of ℂ∪{∞}.\n\nProblem: Show there exists an analytic function f(z) on D such that E is the set of cluster values of f along {z_k}.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions \"a domain D\" and \"closed subset E\"—so those are explicit. The sequence being distinct and accumulating at the boundary is given. The user's own thoughts about the unit disk and the theorem are part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. So they shouldn't be included in the formatted problem.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list those four assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. Then the problem statement as given.",
