    "Content": "Sorry if this is a silly question but most books claim  $\\log n < n$ for $n \\geq 1$ without providing any proof, saying it's too obvious. Could someone give me a rigorous proof? Is there some trick or method I forgot about?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If we let $f(n) = \\log n$ and $g(n) = n$, then $f'(n) = \\frac{1}{n}$ and $g'(n)=1$.  Since $f(1) < g(1)$ and $f'(n) \\leq g'(n)$ for $n \\geq 1$, we must have $f(n) < g(n)$ for all $n \\geq 1$. The idea in the last sentence is sometimes called the racetrack principle : If $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ denote the positions of horses $f$ and $g$ at time $n$, horse $f$ starts behind horse $g$ (i.e, $f(1) < g(1)$), and at any given time horse $f$ is never faster than horse $g$ (i.e, $f'(n) \\leq g'(n)$) then horse $f$ will always be behind horse $g$ (i.e, $f(n) < g(n)$ for $n \\geq 1$). OP asks for a proof of the racetrack principle. The racetrack principle : If $f(a) < g(a)$ and $f'(n) \\leq g'(n)$ for $n \\geq a$, then $f(n) < g(n)$ for $n \\geq a$. Proof :\nLet $h(n) = f(n) - g(n)$.  Then $h'(n) = f'(n) - g'(n) \\leq 0$.  The mean value theorem tells us that there exists some point $x \\in [a,n]$ such that \n$$h'(x) = \\frac{h(n) - h(a)}{n-a}.$$\nSince we know the claim is true for $n=a$, take $n > a$.  We already know $h'(x) \\leq 0$, so we get $h(n) - h(a) \\leq 0$, which means $f(n) - g(n) \\leq f(a) - g(a) < 0$, and so $f(n) < g(n)$ for $n \\geq 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants a rigorous proof that log n is less than n for all n ≥ 1. First, I need to recall some properties of logarithmic functions and compare them to linear functions. \n\nHmm, log n grows much slower than n, right? But how do I formally show that? Maybe induction? Let's think about induction. For n=1, log base whatever of 1 is 0, which is less than 1. So that works. Suppose it's true for some k ≥1, then need to show it holds for k+1. But wait, log(k+1) vs k+1. Not sure if induction is straightforward here because the inductive step might not hold easily. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function f(n) = n - log n. If I can show that this function is always positive for n ≥1, that would work. To do that, maybe take the derivative (if considering n as a real variable). Let f(x) = x - ln x. The derivative f’(x) = 1 - 1/x. Setting derivative to zero: 1 - 1/x =0 → x=1. At x=1, f(1)=1 -0=1. Then check behavior around x=1. For x>1, derivative is positive, so function is increasing. For 0<x<1, derivative is negative, but our domain is x ≥1. So minimum value at x=1 is 1, which is positive. Therefore, f(x) ≥1 for all x ≥1. Hence, x - ln x ≥1 >0 → ln x <x. That works for natural log. But the original problem says log n <n. Wait, what base is the log here? The user didn't specify, but in computer science contexts, log base 2 is common, while in math, natural log or base e. However, the inequality holds for any base >1 because log_b n = ln n / ln b. Since ln b is a positive constant, log_b n <n would still hold if we can show it for natural log and adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to base 10? The problem statement just says log n. Hmm, but in math textbooks, when they say log n without base, sometimes it's natural log, but other times base 10. Wait, the original question mentions that books claim log n <n for n ≥1. Maybe they are using a specific base. For example, in Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS, they use log base 2, but they also mention that the inequality holds for any base >1. Maybe the base doesn't matter because logarithms of any base are proportional to each other. For example, log_b n = log n / log b, so if log n <n, then log_b n = (1/log b) * log n < (1/log b)*n. But unless (1/log b) ≤1, which would require log b ≥1, i.e., b ≥e. Wait, if the base is greater than e, then 1/log b <1, so log_b n < (1/log b)*n. But the original statement is log_b n <n. So if b ≥e, then log_b n <n because log_b n < (1/log b)*n ≤n? Wait, that seems not necessarily. For example, if b=10, then log_10 n = ln n / ln 10 ≈ ln n /2.3026. So log_10 n <n would require that ln n <2.3026 n, which is true because ln n grows slower than n. So regardless of the base, log n <n for n≥1. Therefore, maybe the problem is general for any logarithm base >1.\n\nBut the user didn't specify the base, which could be an issue. However, the answer should address the base. Wait, in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"log n < n for n ≥1\". So perhaps they are using natural logarithm, or maybe the base doesn't matter. The key is to prove that inequality. So perhaps the approach is to show that for any base b>1, log_b n <n for all n≥1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using base 2 or base 10. The user didn't specify, but the answer should probably state the assumption about the base. But the original problem as presented doesn't have any assumptions listed, so when structuring it according to the required format, maybe the assumption is that the logarithm is base e, or that the base is greater than 1. Wait, looking back at the example given in the problem, the user structured the original problem's assumption as \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" So in this case, the problem's assumption might need to be listed. However, the current problem as stated in the question doesn't list any assumptions except n ≥1. But the problem is to prove log n <n for n≥1. So the assumptions here would be that n is a real number greater than or equal to 1, or n is an integer? The original question says \"for n ≥1\" but doesn't specify if n is integer or real. The user's question on Math Stack Exchange says \"for n ≥1\", and the user is asking for a rigorous proof. So perhaps the assumption is that n is an integer ≥1, but in the answer, we might need to consider n as a real number ≥1 and show the inequality holds for all such n, which would then include integers. But the original problem might not specify, so as per the example, the assistant should list assumptions line by line. But in this case, the problem as stated by the user doesn't have additional assumptions beyond n ≥1. However, the example given in the problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was stated as \"for every integer n\". So the assistant added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no. Wait the original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts it. Maybe the example was incorrect. But according to the user's instruction, when they provided the example, they structured the problem by filtering unrelated information. So perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrected it. But regardless, the task is to structure the given problem according to the format. For the current problem: \"How to prove log n < n?\" with the question stating that books claim this for n ≥1.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥1.\n\nBut the original problem might consider n as a real number. Wait, the user's question says \"for n ≥1\", and in the context of mathematics, log n is defined for n>0, but when n is an integer, it's also valid. However, the inequality log n <n holds for all real numbers n ≥1. So maybe the assumptions should include that n is a real number and n ≥1. But the user's example used integer n. Hmm. Since the example used integer n, maybe the assistant should assume that here too. But the problem statement in the question doesn't specify whether n is integer or real. So perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as:\n\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nAlternatively, if the context is discrete (since it's comparing log n and n for integers), but in mathematics, log n <n is often proven for real numbers. For example, the function f(x)=x - log x is positive for x>0, but reaches minimum at x=1. So maybe the problem is intended for real numbers. The user's question mentions \"books claim log n <n for n≥1 without providing any proof\", so perhaps in the books, n is considered as a positive integer. But the rigorous proof might consider real numbers. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem was about integers, and the formatted problem kept n as integer but added another assumption. So perhaps in this case, the original problem's assumption is n is an integer, but the problem could be more general. However, the user's question doesn't specify, so the assistant should list the necessary assumptions. Since the problem is to prove log n <n for n≥1, and in the absence of more information, the safest assumptions are that n is a real number greater than or equal to 1. However, in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and added another condition. So perhaps here, the assumption is n is an integer, but maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, the problem might not require any specific assumptions beyond n ≥1. But the example added an assumption even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, the example seems to have changed the problem. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the scope. That seems incorrect. Unless there was a misinterpretation. Maybe the original problem had a typo or the formatted version was for a different problem. But given the example, the user wants to extract assumptions from the original problem. In the current problem, the original problem is: \"Prove that log n <n for n ≥1\". The assumptions here are that n is ≥1. But the user might want to list the domain of n. So, if n is an integer, then assumption is n is an integer, n ≥1. If n is real, then n is a real number, n ≥1. Since the problem statement says \"for n ≥1\", it's ambiguous. However, in mathematical analysis, such inequalities are often proven for real numbers. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nBut the example given by the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem where the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrected it. For instance, if the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the correct assumption is that n is divisible by 7, then the formatted problem lists that. But in the current case, the problem is to prove log n <n for n ≥1, so the necessary assumptions are the domain of n and the conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n < n.\n\nBut the original problem's question was in the context of Math Stack Exchange, where the user says \"most books claim log n <n for n ≥1\". So maybe the books are referring to integers, but the proof can be done for real numbers. The user is asking for a rigorous proof, so it's better to consider n as a real number ≥1. Therefore, the assumptions are n is real and n ≥1. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about integers and divisibility. So perhaps the user's example is different, and here we should follow the current problem's needs.\n\nAnother angle: Sometimes, the inequality log n <n is proven using calculus by considering the function f(n)=n - log n and showing it's always positive for n≥1. Alternatively, using induction for integers. Let me check induction. For n=1: log 1=0 <1. Assume true for n=k: log k <k. Then for n=k+1: log(k+1) <k+1. But how to relate log(k+1) to log k? Not straightforward. Alternatively, use the inequality that log(1+x) <x for x>0. Let x= k+1 -k =1, but not sure. Alternatively, for real numbers, using calculus. The derivative approach seems more straightforward. So perhaps the problem is intended for real numbers. Therefore, the assumption is that n is a real number greater than or equal to 1. But the user might have intended n as integer. However, since the problem is to structure it according to the format, the assistant needs to list the assumptions. Given that the example included assumptions beyond what was in the original problem (adding divisibility by 7), but in this case, the original problem doesn't have additional conditions, so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n <n.\n\nBut wait, the original question on Math Stack Exchange says \"for n ≥1\" without specifying real or integer. The user is asking for a rigorous proof. Therefore, the proper assumptions are that n is a real number ≥1. If the problem were about integers, induction might be a method, but since calculus is needed for the real case, and the inequality holds for all real n ≥1, that's a stronger statement. Therefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n <n.\n\nBut I need to check the example again. In the example, the original problem was about integers, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake unless the original problem had a typo. But regardless, following the current problem, the assumptions are n is real and ≥1. However, the user's example might indicate that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem can add assumptions. But in this case, the original problem doesn't have any additional assumptions, so the formatted problem would just list the necessary assumptions. Alternatively, if the problem is about integers, the assumption is n is an integer ≥1. The answer would then need to prove log n <n for integers n ≥1. But even so, the proof would likely use real analysis because log n for integers can be compared using real functions. Therefore, the key is to specify the domain of n.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as n being a real number greater than or equal to 1, and the problem is to prove log n <n under those assumptions. However, if the original problem's context is discrete (e.g., in computer science), then n might be an integer. But without more information, the safest assumption is that n is a real number. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n <n.\n\nAlternatively, if considering integers:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n <n.\n\nBut since the user mentioned \"rigorous proof\", considering real numbers is more appropriate. Therefore, the former assumption is better. However, in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the task is to extract implicit assumptions. But in the current problem, there's no implicit assumption beyond n ≥1 and the nature of n (real or integer). Therefore, the formatted problem would depend on whether n is considered real or integer. Since the example used an integer assumption, maybe the user expects the same here. But the problem's answer would require different approaches for real vs integer. For the most comprehensive proof, considering real numbers is better. Hence, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n <n.\n\nBut the user's example didn't specify whether n was real or integer, but added an assumption. However, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, and the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7, which is confusing. Perhaps the example was a mistake. Anyway, focusing on the current problem, the key is to list the necessary assumptions for the problem. Therefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n <n.\n\nAlternatively, if the log's base is not specified, perhaps an assumption about the base is needed. The problem states \"log n <n\". If the base of the logarithm is less than or equal to 1, the logarithm isn't defined properly. So another assumption is that the logarithm is base b >1. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1,\nlogarithm base is greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n <n.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention the base. However, since the inequality holds for any base >1, it's important to specify. Therefore, adding that assumption would be necessary. Hence, the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1,\nlogarithm is base b >1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log_b n <n.\n\nBut the original question on Math Stack Exchange didn't specify the base, so maybe the answer should address that. However, according to the user's instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the example. The example didn't include assumptions about the base, but the original problem there was about divisibility. So perhaps in this case, the base is assumed to be a specific one, but the user didn't mention it. Given that, it's safer to assume natural logarithm (base e) unless stated otherwise. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ln n <n.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about logarithm with base 2 or 10, but since it's not specified, the natural logarithm is the default in mathematics. However, the notation \"log n\" can vary. In computer science, it's often base 2, in engineering base 10, in math base e. But since the inequality holds for any base >1, perhaps the base is arbitrary, but the assumption should state that. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1,\nlogarithm base is greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n <n.\n\nBut since the user's original problem didn't specify the base, and the problem is to structure it according to the example, which in the example didn't have assumptions about the base, maybe it's better to leave it as log n without specifying the base, but in the assumptions include that the base is greater than 1. However, in the example, the assumptions were about n, not about the other components. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should focus only on n's conditions. The base of the logarithm is part of the problem's statement, not an assumption about the variable. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are only about n:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a real number,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log n <n.\n\nIn this case, the base of the logarithm is considered part of the problem's given, not an assumption. Therefore, the answer would need to specify that the base is >1. But in the problem statement, the user wrote \"log n <n\", so it's part of the problem, not an assumption. Hence, the formatted problem would list assumptions about n only.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is a real number,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\log n < n$.",
