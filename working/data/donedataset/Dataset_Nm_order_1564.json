    "Content": "On (not in) a sphere, choose three independent uniformly random points $A,B,C$ . Is the following conjecture true: The expectation of the ratio of the area of (planar) $\\triangle ABC$ to the area of the (planar) disk with $A,B,C$ on its perimeter, is $1/4$ . My conjecture is based on experimentation: using sphere point picking , I ran $1.5\\times10^7$ trials and the average ratio was about $0.2500075$ . Since $1/4$ is a simple ratio, I am wondering if there is an intuitive explanation (here is a recent example ), but any proof is welcome. Remarks: Assume the sphere is a unit sphere. The expected area of the disk is $\\frac{4\\pi}{5}$ ( proof ). The expected area of the triangle seems to be $\\frac{\\pi}{5}$ based on experimentation, but I don't have a proof (Wolfram has a page called \" Sphere triangle picking \" but it's empty). Curiously, the expectation of the ratio seems to equal the ratio of the expectations. The probability that the ratio is greater than $1/4$ is about $0.534$ . The standard deviation of the ratio is about $0.10667$ (could it be $8/75$ ?). The probability density function of the ratio looks roughly like this: The expectation of the reciprocal ratio (i.e. the ratio of the area of the disk to the area of the triangle) seems to be about $6.6$ , but this ratio flucuates a lot and I'm not sure its expectation even exists. My attempt: I tried to adopt the techniques in the proof that the area of the disk is $\\frac{4\\pi}{5}$ (with a unit sphere), but I don't know how to express the area of the triangle in a usable way. I tried to find a more intuitive explanation, possibly using symmetry, but failed. (In the $2D$ case, the expected ratio of areas is $\\frac{3}{2\\pi^2}\\approx 0.15198$ ( proof ), which is not an intuition-friendly number, so it seems that an intuitive explanation would apply to the $3D$ case but not the $2D$ case.) Context: This question was inspired by a question about a random triangle inscribed in a circle.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "What makes this interesting is how to obtain the joint distribution of the points on the circle. Writing three uniformly random points in spherical coordinates and trying to obtain the corresponding angles on the circle leads to a convoluted mess, so let’s try to go the other way and calculate the Jacobian for three points parameterized using the circle they form. Let the circle be parallel to the $x$ - $y$ plane at polar angle $\\theta$ , with three points at azimuthal angles $\\varphi_i$ , so their coordinates are $\\vec r_i=(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi_i,\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi_i,\\cos\\theta)$ . To move this configuration into general position, we can rotate the $z$ axis into an arbitrary direction, e.g. by applying rotations about the $y$ axis and then the $x$ axis, through $\\psi$ and $\\xi$ , say, for a total of six parameters, as required. Consider the infinitesimal changes along the six orthogonal unit vectors in the directions $\\frac{\\partial\\vec r_i}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\vec r_i}{\\partial\\varphi_i}$ when we change these parameters. That’s six changes for six parameters, so we get a $6\\times6$ Jacobian. Label the columns by $\\varphi_1,\\varphi_2,\\varphi_3,\\theta,\\psi,\\xi$ and the rows by $\\frac{\\partial\\vec r_1}{\\partial\\varphi_1},\\frac{\\partial\\vec r_2}{\\partial\\varphi_2},\\frac{\\partial\\vec r_3}{\\partial\\varphi_3},\\frac{\\partial\\vec r_1}{\\partial\\theta},\\frac{\\partial\\vec r_2}{\\partial\\theta},\\frac{\\partial\\vec r_3}{\\partial\\theta}$ . Since we only need the dependence of the joint distribution on the $\\varphi_i$ , I’m going to drop all factors that don’t depend on them. Then the upper left $3\\times3$ minor is the identity, and the one below it is zero, since changing $\\varphi_i$ only causes a change along the corresponding vector $\\frac{\\partial\\vec r_i}{\\partial\\varphi_i}$ and the magnitude of that change is the same for all points (namely $\\sin\\theta$ ) and doesn’t depend on the $\\varphi_i$ . Thus, to get the determinant of the Jacobian, we can use Laplace expansion along the first three columns, which leaves us with the determinant of the lower right $3\\times3$ minor. The first column of that minor, which contains the changes with $\\theta$ along $\\frac{\\partial r_i}{\\partial\\theta}$ , has all entries $1$ . To obtain the other two columns, consider the effect of the infinitesimal generators $\\pmatrix{0&0&\\epsilon\\\\0&0&0\\\\-\\epsilon&0&0}$ and $\\pmatrix{0&0&0\\\\0&0&\\epsilon\\\\0&-\\epsilon&0}$ of rotations about the $y$ and $x$ axis, respectively, on the $\\vec r_i$ : $$\n\\pmatrix{0&0&\\epsilon\\\\0&0&0\\\\-\\epsilon&0&0}\\pmatrix{\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi_i\\\\\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi_i\\\\\\cos\\theta}=\\epsilon\\pmatrix{\\cos\\theta\\\\0\\\\-\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi_i}\\;,\n\\\\[18pt]\n\\pmatrix{0&0&0\\\\0&0&\\epsilon\\\\0&-\\epsilon&0}\\pmatrix{\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi_i\\\\\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi_i\\\\\\cos\\theta}=\\epsilon\\pmatrix{0\\\\\\cos\\theta\\\\-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi_i}\\;.\n$$ Taking the scalar product with the unit vector $\\frac{\\partial r_i}{\\partial\\theta}=(\\cos\\theta\\cos\\varphi_i,\\cos\\theta\\sin\\varphi_i,-\\sin\\theta)$ yields $\\cos\\varphi_i$ and $\\sin\\varphi_i$ , respectively, so the lower right minor is $$\\begin{vmatrix}1&\\cos\\varphi_1&\\sin\\varphi_1\\\\1&\\cos\\varphi_2&\\sin\\varphi_2\\\\1&\\cos\\varphi_3&\\sin\\varphi_3\\end{vmatrix}\\;.$$ Interestingly, this happens to be proportional to the area of the triangle formed by the points, whose ratio to the area of the circle is, as Blitzer noted in a comment, given by $$\\frac2\\pi\\left|\\sin\\frac\\alpha2\\sin\\frac\\beta2\\sin\\frac\\gamma2\\right|=\\frac1{2\\pi}|\\sin \\alpha+\\sin\\beta+\\sin\\gamma|\\;,$$ where $\\alpha=\\varphi_2-\\varphi_1$ , $\\beta=\\varphi_3-\\varphi_2$ and $\\gamma=\\varphi_1-\\varphi_3$ . Thus, the expected value of this ratio is $$\n\\mathsf E\\left[\\frac\\triangle\\bigcirc\\right]\n=\n\\frac1{2\\pi}\\cdot\\frac{\\iiint(\\sin\\alpha+\\sin\\beta+\\sin\\gamma)^2\\mathrm d\\varphi_1\\mathrm d\\varphi_2\\mathrm d\\varphi_3}{\\iiint|\\sin\\alpha+\\sin\\beta+\\sin\\gamma|\\mathrm d\\varphi_1\\mathrm d\\varphi_2\\mathrm d\\varphi_3}\\;.\n$$ In the numerator, the integral over the mixed terms vanishes, leaving $$\n\\iiint\\left(\\sin^2\\alpha+\\sin^2\\beta+\\sin^2\\gamma\\right)\\mathrm d\\varphi_1\\mathrm d\\varphi_2\\mathrm d\\varphi_3=\\frac32(2\\pi)^3\\;.\n$$ In the denominator, by symmetry we can restrict to the $\\varphi_i$ ordered counterclockwise (and thus $\\alpha$ , $\\beta$ , $\\gamma$ positive) to get rid of the absolute value and obtain \\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\iiint|\\sin\\alpha+\\sin\\beta+\\sin\\gamma|\\,\\mathrm d\\varphi_1\\mathrm d\\varphi_2\\mathrm d\\varphi_3\n&=&\n2\\cdot3\\cdot2\\pi\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi-\\alpha}\\sin\\alpha\\,\\mathrm d\\beta\\,\\mathrm d\\alpha\n\\\\\n&=&\n2\\cdot3\\cdot2\\pi\\int_0^{2\\pi}(2\\pi-\\alpha)\\sin\\alpha\\,\\mathrm d\\alpha\n\\\\\n&=&\n2\\cdot3\\cdot(2\\pi)^2\\;.\n\\end{eqnarray*} Thus, with $$\n\\frac1{2\\pi}\\cdot\\frac{\\frac32(2\\pi)^3}{2\\cdot3\\cdot(2\\pi)^2}=\\frac14\\;,\n$$ your numerical findings are confirmed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the problem carefully to understand all the assumptions and the main question.\n\nThe title of the question is a conjecture: \"If A, B, C are random points on a sphere, then the expectation of the ratio of the area of triangle ABC to the area of the circumcircle of ABC is 1/4.\" The user wants to know if this conjecture is true based on their experimental results.\n\nLooking at the assumptions mentioned in the question:\n1. The sphere is a unit sphere. The user mentions \"Assume the sphere is a unit sphere.\"\n2. Points A, B, C are chosen independently and uniformly at random on the sphere. The question states \"choose three independent uniformly random points A,B,C.\"\n3. The areas considered are planar areas. The problem refers to the \"area of (planar) triangle ABC\" and the \"area of the (planar) disk\" (which is the circumcircle of the triangle).\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object:\n- The sphere is a unit sphere.\n- Points A, B, C are independently chosen.\n- Points A, B, C are uniformly random on the sphere.\n- The area of triangle ABC is planar.\n- The area of the circumcircle (disk) is planar.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"on (not in) a sphere,\" but since they are points on the sphere's surface, that's already covered by choosing points on the sphere. Also, the user mentions that the conjecture is about the expectation of the ratio being 1/4. The problem part should restate the conjecture.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each condition:\n1. The sphere is a unit sphere.\n2. Points A, B, C are chosen independently.\n3. Points A, B, C are uniformly random on the sphere.\n4. The area of triangle ABC is computed as a planar area (not spherical).\n5. The area of the circumcircle (disk) is computed as a planar area.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. For example, \"A, B, C are independent uniformly random points on the sphere\" could be one assumption. However, the example provided in the user's instruction lists each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property. So maybe split them:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sphere is a unit sphere.\n- Points A, B, C are chosen independently.\n- Points A, B, C are uniformly random on the sphere.\n- The area of triangle ABC is planar.\n- The area of the disk (circumcircle of ABC) is planar.\n\nBut perhaps \"independently\" and \"uniformly random\" can be combined into one line: \"Points A, B, C are independent and uniformly random on the sphere.\"\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the areas are planar, which is important because otherwise, the spherical triangle area would be different. So those are two separate assumptions.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove that the expectation of the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of its circumcircle is 1/4.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sphere is a unit sphere.\n- Points A, B, C are independent and uniformly random on the sphere.\n- The area of triangle ABC is computed as planar.\n- The area of the circumcircle (disk) containing A, B, C on its perimeter is computed as planar.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the expectation of the ratio of the area of triangle ABC to the area of the circumcircle containing A, B, C on its perimeter is 1/4.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"the area of the (planar) disk with A,B,C on its perimeter\" which is the circumcircle. So I need to ensure that the problem is phrased correctly.\n\nYes. So the problem is about the expectation of the ratio of the planar triangle area to the planar circumcircle area being 1/4.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check the original question again to make sure I didn't miss any assumptions. The user also mentions some remarks, like the expected area of the disk is 4π/5 and the triangle is π/5, but those are results or conjectures, not assumptions. So those shouldn't be in the assumption section. The assumptions are the conditions given for the problem.\n\nSo the final answer should list each assumption line by line, then the problem.",
