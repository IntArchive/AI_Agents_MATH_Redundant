    "Content": "Let f be a mapping from an open neighbourhood of the 3-dimensional unit ball to the 2-dimensional plane. Suppose that f is smooth (infinitely continuously differentiable on its domain) and regular (it's derivative, as a 2x3 matrix, has rank 2 everywhere). I would like a proof, or informed hint, or counterexample, for the claim that the f restricted to the closed unit ball has the same range as f restricted to the unit sphere. It is not difficult to construct a counterexample when f is allowed to be nonregular. I have stated the problem for a mapping from 3 to 2 dimensions but there may be a similar problem going from n to n-1 dimensions. For n=2 the proof is trivial: a regular differentiable mapping from the closed unit disk to the line reaches its maximum on the boundary circle.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a very interesting problem. Despite originally thinking the result was true and posting a flawed \"proof\" here, I can now show that it is false. To do this, I will make use of a published result to imply the existence of a counterexample, although a more explicit construction would be desirable. First, a bit of notation. Regular maps as stated in the question are submersions . A knot is a circle embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (we only consider smoothly embedded knots here), and a link $L\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a union $L=\\bigcup_{i=1}^nL_i$ of a finite pairwise disjoint set of knots, $\\{L_1,L_2,\\ldots,L_n\\}$.\nGiven any disjoint pair $L_i,L_j$ of knots, let $lk(L_i,L_j)$ be their linking number . I will use a result by Gilbert Hector and Daniel Peralta-Salas 1 . A subset $L$ of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is strongly integrable ( SI ) if $L=\\Phi^{-1}(0)$ for some smooth submersion $\\Phi\\colon\\mathbb{R}^3\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$. Now, quoting from Hector & Peralta-Salas. Theorem 3.6.11. A link in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is SI if and only if\n$$\n\\sum_{j\\not=i}lk(L_i,L_j)=1\\ mod.\\ 2\n$$\nfor all $i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$. For example, this condition is satisfied for the Hopf link $L=L_1\\cup L_2$ for a pair of knots $L_1,L_2$ with linking number 1, so $L$ is SI . For our counterexample, we only require that there does exist a link which is SI . As links are compact, they are bounded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ so, by scaling, we can suppose that $L$ is contained in the open ball of radius $1$. Then, there is a smooth submersion $\\Phi\\colon\\mathbb{R}^3\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $L=\\Phi^{-1}(0)$. So, $0$ is in the image of $\\Phi$ restricted to the closed unit ball, but is not in the image of $\\Phi$ restricted to the unit sphere, giving the required counterexample. 1 Hector, G., Peralta-Salas, D: Integrable embeddings and foliations , American Journal of Mathematics, 134 , 773-825 (2012), doi: 10.1353/ajm.2012.0018 , available at arXiv:1012.4312 .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then clearly state the problem.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the range of a map restricted to a closed unit ball is the same as when restricted to the unit sphere, under certain conditions. Let me parse through the details.\n\nThe function f is defined from an open neighborhood of the 3-dimensional unit ball to the 2D plane. It's smooth (infinitely differentiable) and regular, meaning its derivative matrix has rank 2 everywhere. The problem is to show that the range of f on the closed ball is the same as on the sphere. The user also mentions possible generalizations but the main focus is the 3D to 2D case.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. f is a mapping from an open neighborhood of the 3-dimensional unit ball to the 2-dimensional plane. So the domain is an open set around the unit ball in 3D, and the codomain is the plane.\n2. f is smooth, i.e., infinitely continuously differentiable on its domain. That's a key regularity condition.\n3. f is regular: the derivative (Jacobian matrix) is a 2x3 matrix with rank 2 everywhere in the domain. This implies that f is a submersion, which has certain properties, like the image being open or something related to regular values.\n4. The problem compares the range (image) of f restricted to the closed unit ball versus the unit sphere. The claim is they have the same range.\n\nPossible pitfalls: Maybe there's a point inside the ball that maps to a value not achieved on the boundary. But due to the regularity conditions, perhaps the maximum modulus principle or some similar theorem applies? Wait, but this is a map to the plane, not complex analysis. For n=2, the user says it's trivial because the maximum is on the boundary, but in higher dimensions, it's different.\n\nBut the problem is not about maxima, but about the entire image. So under the given conditions, why would the image of the ball be the same as the image of the sphere? The assumptions include that the derivative has full rank (rank 2), which for a map from 3D to 2D means that at every point, the map is a submersion. Submersions are open maps, so locally they map open sets to open sets. However, the closed ball is compact, so its image is compact, hence closed. But the image of the sphere is also compact. But how does the submersion property ensure that nothing extra is added when considering the interior?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Sard's theorem or the regular value theorem. Wait, but the rank condition here is on the derivative of f itself, not on the preimage of a regular value. Since f is a submersion everywhere, then every point is a regular point, so the image should be a union of open sets in the plane, but the image of the closed ball is compact, so closed and bounded. However, the plane isn't compact, so perhaps the image is the same as the sphere's image because the submersion can't have critical points, so any extremum in the image would have to be on the boundary? Wait, but for functions to the real line, extrema on the boundary, but here it's to the plane. Maybe using the fact that the image is connected and the boundary's image is closed, and the interior's image can't add anything new.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if there's a point in the interior of the ball that maps to some value, then by the submersion property, there's a neighborhood around that point mapped onto an open neighborhood in the plane. But since the sphere's image is compact, maybe the open neighborhoods would overlap, but I'm not sure. Maybe using the fact that the map is open on the interior, but the sphere's image is closed. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nBut regardless, the user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's extract those:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. f is a smooth (infinitely continuously differentiable) mapping from an open neighborhood of the 3-dimensional unit ball to the 2-dimensional plane.\n2. The derivative of f (as a 2x3 matrix) has rank 2 everywhere in its domain (f is regular).\n3. The problem considers f restricted to the closed unit ball.\n4. The problem considers f restricted to the unit sphere (boundary of the ball).\n\nProblem: Prove that the range (image) of f restricted to the closed unit ball is the same as the range of f restricted to the unit sphere.\n\nWait, but in the example given, assumptions were about the object (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). So here, the objects are f, the domain, the codomain, the smoothness, the regularity, and the restrictions to the closed ball and sphere.\n\nSo each assumption should be a separate line, each about one property of one object. Let me rephrase:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a smooth mapping defined on an open neighborhood of the 3-dimensional unit ball.\n- The codomain of f is the 2-dimensional plane.\n- The derivative of f (as a 2×3 matrix) has rank 2 everywhere in its domain.\n- The problem considers the restriction of f to the closed unit ball.\n- The problem considers the restriction of f to the unit sphere.\n\nProblem: Prove that the range of f restricted to the closed unit ball is equal to the range of f restricted to the unit sphere.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user says \"Suppose that f is smooth... and regular...\". So these are the conditions. The domain is an open neighborhood of the 3D unit ball, codomain is the plane. So each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo structured:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a smooth (infinitely continuously differentiable) mapping.\n- The domain of f is an open neighborhood of the 3-dimensional unit ball.\n- The codomain of f is the 2-dimensional plane.\n- The derivative of f (as a 2×3 matrix) has rank 2 everywhere in its domain.\n- The problem considers the restriction of f to the closed unit ball.\n- The problem considers the restriction of f to the unit sphere.\n\nBut maybe combining some. However, the example separates each assumption line by line. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So here, each distinct condition should be a separate line.\n\nWait, the original problem's assumptions are:\n\n- f is a mapping from an open neighborhood of the 3D unit ball to the 2D plane.\n\n- f is smooth (infinitely continuously differentiable on its domain).\n\n- f is regular (derivative has rank 2 everywhere).\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. Additionally, the problem is about f restricted to the closed ball and the sphere, but those are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Wait, the problem says \"the claim that the f restricted to the closed unit ball has the same range as f restricted to the unit sphere.\" So the problem is to prove that equality of ranges. The assumptions are the conditions on f (smooth, regular, domain, codomain). The restrictions to closed ball and sphere are part of the problem's setup, not assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" which was part of the problem's condition, but the user had filtered that. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided that as their example.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, and the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. But looking at the original example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So the user's example might have a mistake. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to list all the conditions given in the problem as assumptions, even if they are universal quantifications. Hmm, but in this current problem, the problem is stated as \"for the claim that the f restricted to the closed unit ball has the same range as f restricted to the unit sphere.\" So the problem is to prove that equality under the given conditions on f.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a mapping from an open neighborhood of the 3-dimensional unit ball to the 2-dimensional plane.\n\n- f is smooth (infinitely continuously differentiable on its domain).\n\n- f is regular (its derivative, as a 2x3 matrix, has rank 2 everywhere).\n\nThe problem is to prove that f restricted to the closed unit ball has the same range as f restricted to the unit sphere.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, each of these three should be separate assumptions. The restrictions to the closed ball and sphere are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Because the problem is about comparing those two restrictions. So the assumptions are about f's properties, and the problem is about the ranges of those restrictions.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a mapping from an open neighborhood of the 3-dimensional unit ball to the 2-dimensional plane.\n- f is smooth (infinitely continuously differentiable) on its domain.\n- The derivative of f (as a 2×3 matrix) has rank 2 everywhere in its domain.\n\nProblem: Prove that the range of f restricted to the closed unit ball is equal to the range of f restricted to the unit sphere.\n\nI think that's correct. The mention of the closed ball and sphere is part of the problem's statement, not the assumptions. The assumptions are the domain, codomain, smoothness, and regularity. The problem is about comparing the images of two subsets (closed ball and sphere) under f.",
