    "Content": "Consider triangle ABC. Point D is on AC, E is on BC and F is on AB. Given that triangle DEF is equilateral and that segments CD, BE and AF are equal in length, prove that triangle ABC must also be equilateral. I've played with this one for long enough using circles, sine law, cosine law, etc., and have almost reached the point of capitulation. Any hints would be appreciated. I'm not actually sure if the statement is true, but I haven't been able to find a counterexample, either, so I'm stuck both ways.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be the lengths of the sides opposite $A$, $B$, $C$, and let points $D$, $E$, $F$ lie on the sides opposite $A$, $B$, $C$. (The latter is slightly different than in the original question). Let $r = |DE| = |EF| = |FD|$ be the length of the sides of the equilateral triangle; let $s = |AF| = |BD| = |CE|$ be the lengths of the congruent sub-segments of the sides. The Law of Cosines for each $r$-side in $\\triangle AEF$, $\\triangle BFD$, $\\triangle CDE$ gives $$\\begin{align}\nr^2 = s^2 + (b-s)^2 - 2 s (b-s) \\cos A \\\\\nr^2 = s^2 + (c-s)^2 - 2 s (c-s) \\cos B \\\\\nr^2 = s^2 + (a-s)^2 - 2 s (a-s) \\cos C\n\\end{align}$$ Setting the right-hand sides equal and subtracting $2s^2$ yields:\n$$b^2-2bs-2s(b-s)\\cos A = c^2-2cs-2s(c-s)\\cos B = a^2 - 2 a s - 2 s(a-s) \\cos C$$ Using the Law of Cosines (in $\\triangle ABC$) to re-write each of $\\cos A$, $\\cos B$, $\\cos C$, and then simplifying a bit, gives $$\\begin{align}\n&\\phantom{=}\\;a\\left( s^2\\left(-a^2+b^2+c^2\\right)+ s b\\left(a^2-\\left(b+c\\right)^2\\right)+b^3 c\\right) \\\\\n&= b\\left( s^2\\left(\\phantom{-}a^2-b^2+c^2\\right)+ s c\\left(b^2-\\left(c+a\\right)^2\\right)+c^3 a\\right) \\\\ \n&= c\\left( s^2\\left(\\phantom{-}a^2+b^2-c^2\\right)+ s a\\left(c^2-\\left(a+b\\right)^2\\right)+a^3 b\\right)\n\\end{align}$$ We can break the triple equality into a system of two quadratic equations in the parameter $s$. Eliminating $s$ gives a polynomial equation, $p(a,b,c)=0$; the factors of $p$ provide these equations:\n$$\\begin{align}\nabc (a+b+c) &= 0 &(1) \\\\\na^2 b\\left(a-b\\right)+b^2c\\left(b-c\\right)+c^2 a\\left(c-a\\right) &= 0 & (2) \\\\\na b\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a\\left(b-c\\right)\\left(a^2-b^2\\right)-b^2c^2\\right) \\\\\n+b c\\left(b-c\\right)\\left(b\\left(c-a\\right)\\left(b^2-c^2\\right)-c^2a^2\\right) \\\\\n+c a\\left(c-a\\right)\\left(c\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(c^2-a^2\\right)-a^2b^2\\right) &= 0 & (3)\n\\end{align}$$ Solutions in each case correspond to ostensible solutions to the problem. We can ignore (1), which has only trivial solutions. I believe (2)'s only non-trivial solutions (with the Triangle Inequality in play) require $a=b=c$, but I need to double-check this. As for (3), clearly $a=b=c$ works; and, indeed, if (say) $a=b$, then $a=b=c$. So any non-equilateral solutions would need to be strictly scalene; it turns out that (3) admits scalene solutions. Below is Mathematica's plot of (3), with $c=1$; the horizontal axis is $a$, and the vertical is $b$. The lines are $a+b=c$ and $b+c=a$ and $c+a=b$, which bound the region of feasibility according to the Triangle Inequality. The point $(1,1)$ seems to have been missed by the implicit plotter, but lots of other points appear in blue. (I believe there are even more. Zooms show an island near the $a+b=c$ border, for instance.) Here's the figure for $a=8$, $b=8.58667$, $c=1$: Equilateral $\\triangle DEF$ extends beyond the confines of $\\triangle ABC$. This may be why @Brian was having difficulty ruling-out non-equilateral $\\triangle ABC$s. I suspect equation (3) can be expressed in a way that's more illuminating; it's not clear to me, for instance, whether every solution to (3) corresponds to an \"external\" triangle. There's probably a whole other approach to this problem that makes everything obvious, but this is the best I have at the moment.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that the original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and the formatted version lists assumptions and the problem statement. The key here is to filter out unrelated information and list each assumption clearly, each on one line, addressing one property or condition per object.\n\nLooking at the problem from Math Stack Exchange: The title is \"Equilateral triangle inscribed in a triangle\". The question states: Consider triangle ABC. Point D is on AC, E is on BC, and F is on AB. Given that triangle DEF is equilateral and that segments CD, BE, and AF are equal in length, prove that triangle ABC must also be equilateral. The user tried using circles, sine law, cosine law, etc., but couldn't prove it and is unsure if the statement is true.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem mentions triangle ABC with points D on AC, E on BC, F on AB. Then, triangle DEF is equilateral. Also, segments CD, BE, and AF are equal in length. The goal is to prove ABC is equilateral.\n\nSo the assumptions should be each condition. Each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n1. ABC is a triangle.\n2. D is a point on AC.\n3. E is a point on BC.\n4. F is a point on AB.\n5. Triangle DEF is equilateral.\n6. Segments CD, BE, and AF have equal lengths.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each line is a separate assumption. Here, the problem doesn't state any divisibility or specific constraints except the ones given. So the key conditions are the positions of D, E, F on the sides, DEF being equilateral, and CD=BE=AF.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user didn't mention any additional constraints on ABC, so the only assumptions are the ones given. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem statement: \"Consider triangle ABC. Point D is on AC, E is on BC and F is on AB. Given that triangle DEF is equilateral and that segments CD, BE and AF are equal in length, prove that triangle ABC must also be equilateral.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- ABC is a triangle.\n\nBut maybe that's redundant since the problem is about triangle ABC. Wait, in the example, they listed the assumptions about n. But in this case, the problem is about triangle ABC, so perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given: DEF is equilateral, CD=BE=AF, and D, E, F are on the respective sides.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- D is a point on side AC of triangle ABC.\n\n- E is a point on side BC of triangle ABC.\n\n- F is a point on side AB of triangle ABC.\n\n- Triangle DEF is equilateral.\n\n- Segments CD, BE, and AF are equal in length.\n\nThen the problem is to prove triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nWait, but in the example, they included the divisibility assumption. Here, the problem doesn't have any hidden assumptions; all are stated. So I need to list each condition as a separate line. Each object here is D, E, F, DEF, CD, BE, AF. Each of their properties should be listed.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Point D lies on side AC of triangle ABC.\n\n- Point E lies on side BC of triangle ABC.\n\n- Point F lies on side AB of triangle ABC.\n\n- Triangle DEF is equilateral.\n\n- The lengths of segments CD, BE, and AF are equal.\n\nProblem: Prove that triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is one line, each addressing one property of one object. The problem is to show ABC is equilateral under those conditions.",
