    "Content": "I have the conjecture for the integral $$ \\int_{\\frac{5\\pi}{36}}^{\\frac{7\\pi}{36}} \\ln (\\cot t )\\>dt +\\int_{\\frac{\\pi}{36}}^{\\frac{3\\pi}{36}} \\ln (\\cot t )\\>dt = \\frac49G $$ where $G$ is the Catalan constant, following some heuristic effort. But, I am unable to derive it formally despite having tried for some time. The derivation seems tougher than the tools in my toolbox. I stick to real methods, though, trying to work it out mainly with elementary approaches. The standard procedures do not help that much. For instance, the substitution $u=\\tan t $ is not viable given the inordinate limits; integration-by-parts coverts the integrand to $\\frac t{\\sin 2t}$ , which is not revealing either. The proof for a much simpler integral $$\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\ln(\\cot x)=\\frac23G\n$$ is known, yet perhaps with limited relevance. Maybe, there is no avoidance of resorting to infinite series, complex methods, etc. Edit: Taking the cue from the comments below, the integral can be equivalently expressed as $$\\int_{\\frac{\\pi}{12}}^{\\frac{5\\pi}{36}} \\ln\\left( \\cot (t+\\frac\\pi{36} )\\cot (t-\\frac\\pi{36} )\\right)=\\frac49G$$ which may not reduce the difficulty, albeit appearing compact.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure the problem as per the required format. The user wants the assumptions and the problem statement extracted from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The user mentions an integral involving the natural logarithm of the cotangent function over specific intervals and relates it to the Catalan constant G. The goal is to prove that the sum of these two integrals equals (4/9)G.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about integrals with specific limits and functions. The key elements here are the integrals themselves, the limits of integration, the integrand ln(cot t), and the result involving the Catalan constant.\n\nThe original question states that the user has a conjecture for the integral and tried some methods without success. They mention specific substitutions and conversions but found them not helpful. However, for the assumptions, I need to list the conditions given in the problem. The problem is to prove the equality of the sum of those two integrals to (4/9)G. \n\nSo, the assumptions would be the specific intervals of integration for each integral. Each integral has its own limits, so each integral is an object here. The first integral is from 5π/36 to 7π/36, and the second is from π/36 to 3π/36. The integrand in both is ln(cot t). The result is that their sum equals 4/9 G, where G is the Catalan constant. However, assumptions usually are the given conditions or constraints. In this case, the problem is to prove an equality, so the assumptions might just be the definitions of the integrals. \n\nWait, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions for the problem. Here, the problem is to prove the integral equals 4/9 G. The integral's limits and the integrand are part of the problem statement. So maybe the assumptions here are that G is the Catalan constant and the integrals are defined as such. But I need to check if there are any hidden assumptions or conditions. The user mentions trying real methods, but that's part of their approach, not the problem's assumption. The problem itself doesn't state any conditions except the integrals. \n\nWait, the problem is to show that the sum of those two specific integrals equals 4/9 G. So the assumptions would be the definitions of the integrals. So each integral's limits and integrand are the assumptions. But how to structure that? Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each integral is an object. Let's see:\n\nFirst integral: ∫ from 5π/36 to 7π/36 of ln(cot t) dt\nSecond integral: ∫ from π/36 to 3π/36 of ln(cot t) dt\n\nEach of these is an integral with specific limits and integrand. So the assumptions would list each integral's properties. However, the format says \"assumption: ... each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\"\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first integral is ∫_{5π/36}^{7π/36} ln(cot t) dt,\nThe second integral is ∫_{π/36}^{3π/36} ln(cot t) dt,\nG is the Catalan constant.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum of the first and second integrals equals (4/9)G.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were conditions on n. Here, the integrals are given as part of the problem statement. Maybe the only assumption here is that G is the Catalan constant. But the integrals are part of the problem's statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7 as assumptions, but actually, in the original problem, it's for every integer n. Wait, the user's example seems to have added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption, which restricts n. That might not be correct. Perhaps the example is wrong, but the user provided it as their example. So following that example, maybe in this case, even though the original problem doesn't state any restrictions, the assumptions are the components of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants the assumptions to list the components. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are the definitions of the integrals and G. So each integral is an object with their respective limits and integrands. So each integral is an assumption.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the sum equals 4/9 G. So the assumptions would be the definitions of the integrals and G.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first integral is ∫_{5π/36}^{7π/36} ln(cot t) dt,\nThe second integral is ∫_{π/36}^{3π/36} ln(cot t) dt,\nG denotes the Catalan constant.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum of the first integral and the second integral equals (4/9)G.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line, addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So each integral is an object with their limits and integrand. So each integral's definition is an assumption. Then G being the Catalan constant is another assumption. So three assumptions.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each integral is a separate object with their properties (limits and integrand), and G is defined as the Catalan constant. So that's three assumptions.",
