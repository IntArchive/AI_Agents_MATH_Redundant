    "Content": "Let $f \\in L^1(\\mathbb R)$. If \n  $$\n\\int_\\mathbb R \\int_\\mathbb R \\frac{\\vert f(x)-f(y)\\vert}{\\vert x-y\\vert^2}dxdy<+\\infty\n$$\n  then $f$ is a.e. constant. I do not know how to begin. I thought that we are set if we show that the integrand is bounded a.e. (the function $f$ would be 2-holderian, hence constant)  but this is not true in general. I mean $\\phi \\in L^1(\\mathbb R)$ does not imply $\\phi \\in L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb R)$. Would you please give me some useful hints in order to start? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $$ F(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} f(t) \\,dt $$ be an anti-derivative of $f$ and $E$ the set of Lebesgue points of $f$. Then $E^{c}$ is measure-zero and $F'(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in E$. The condition of the problem tells us that $$ \\int_{\\Bbb{R}}\\int_{\\Bbb{R}} \\frac{\\left| f(x+y) - f(y) \\right|}{x^{2}} \\, dxdy < \\infty. $$ So if $a < b$ are Lebesgue points, then Fubini's Theorem shows \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{a}^{b} \\int_{\\Bbb{R}} \\frac{f(x+y) - f(y)}{x^{2}} \\, dxdy\n&= \\int_{\\Bbb{R}} \\frac{1}{x^{2}} \\int_{a}^{b} \\{ f(x+y) - f(y) \\} \\, dydx \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\Bbb{R}} \\left( \\frac{F(b+x)-F(b)}{x^{2}} - \\frac{F(a+x)-F(a)}{x^{2}} \\right) \\, dx \\tag{1}\n\\end{align*} But since $$ \\frac{F(b+x)-F(b)}{x^{2}} - \\frac{F(a+x)-F(a)}{x^{2}} \\sim \\frac{f(b) - f(a) + o(1)}{x}, \\quad \\text{as } x \\to 0, $$ for the integrand of $\\text{(1)}$ to be integrable near $x = 0$, we must have $f(a) = f(b)$. Since this is true for any $a, b \\in E$, the proof is complete.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that a function f is almost everywhere constant given that a certain integral involving the difference of f(x) and f(y) is finite. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that f is in L^1 of the real numbers, and the double integral over R^2 of |f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y|^2 is finite. These are the key conditions. The user also mentioned they don't know how to start, but my task is just to structure the problem, not solve it.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the assumptions are: f is in L^1(R), and the integral of |f(x)-f(y)| / |x-y|^2 over R^2 is less than infinity. Each of these should be separate lines under Assumption.\n\nThe problem statement then is to prove that f is almost everywhere constant. I need to make sure that the problem is stated clearly, using the LaTeX formatting as in the example. Let me check the original question again for any other conditions, but it seems those are the only two. The rest of the user's text is their thoughts and requests for hints, which I should exclude as per the instructions to filter unrelated information.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have two assumptions and the problem statement. Let me verify against the example to ensure consistency. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, two assumptions: f in L^1 and the integral condition. The problem is to prove f is a.e. constant. Looks good. I think that's all.",
