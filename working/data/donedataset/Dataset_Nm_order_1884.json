    "Content": "a , b are integers. p is prime. I want to prove: $(a+b)^{p} \\equiv a^p + b^p \\pmod p$ I know about Fermat's little theorem, but I still can't get it I know this is valid: $(a+b)^{p} \\equiv a+b \\pmod p$ but from there I don't know what to do. Also I thought about $(a+b)^{p} = \\sum_{k=0}^{p}\\binom{p}{k}a^{k}b^{p-k}=\\binom{p}{0}b^{p}+\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\binom{p}{k} a^{k}b^{p-k}+\\binom{p}{p}a^{p}=b^{p}+\\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\\binom{p}{k}a^{k}b^{p-k}+a^{p}$ Any ideas? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your second idea is good, so let's work a little bit on it: We have that $(a+b)^p=a^p+b^p+\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{p-1}{p\\choose k}a^{k}b^{p-k}$. Obviously it is enough to show that each term of this sum is divisible by $p$ in order to get that the whole sum is $\\equiv 0\\mod p$. So why is that the case? For $1\\leq k\\leq p-1$ we have that ${p\\choose k}=\\frac{p\\cdot (p-1)!}{k!(p-k)!}$ and since $p$ is prime, no factor in the denominator divides $p$, so the denominator does not divide $p$ at all: Hence we have that already $\\frac{(p-1)!}{k!(p-k)!}$ is integer and so $p\\mid{p\\choose k}$. Of course then ${p\\choose k}a^kb^{p-k}$ is divisible by $p$ and hence the whole sum is too.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided helps clarify the expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to read the problem from the user. The original question is about proving that (a + b)^p ≡ a^p + b^p mod p, where a and b are integers and p is prime. The user mentioned using the binomial theorem and Fermat's Little Theorem. \n\nNow, according to the format, I have to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are that a and b are integers and p is a prime number. Each should be a separate line. \n\nWait, but in the example, the second assumption was \"n is divisible by 7,\" but in the original problem, the user had to prove divisibility by 91 (7*13), so maybe the assumption was specific. However, in this current problem, the user hasn't added any extra assumptions beyond what's stated. The problem states a, b integers and p prime. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- a is an integer\n- b is an integer\n- p is a prime number\n\nThen the problem is to prove (a + b)^p ≡ a^p + b^p mod p.\n\nI should check if there are any hidden assumptions. The original problem mentions using Fermat's Little Theorem, but maybe the key point is that p is prime, which is already listed. The user's own attempt uses the binomial expansion and notes that the middle terms have binomial coefficients divisible by p because p is prime. So the crucial assumptions are a, b integers and p prime. No other conditions are mentioned. So the structured problem would list those three assumptions (each on its own line) and then the problem statement.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one per line. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is an integer,\nb is an integer,\np is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(a + b)^{p} \\equiv a^{p} + b^{p} \\pmod{p}$.\n\nThat should be correct. The example had two assumptions, but here there are three. Each is a separate condition. The original problem states all these, so no extra filtering is needed. The user's confusion comes from not connecting the binomial expansion (where the middle terms have coefficients divisible by p) to the modulus, so the key is that p being prime makes those coefficients multiples of p, hence modulo p they vanish. But the structured problem doesn't need that explanation, just the assumptions and the problem.",
