    "Content": "Let $C=C[0,1]$ be the space of all continuous functions on $[0,1]$. Define $\\|f \\|=\\max \\ |f(x)|$. I want to show that $C$ is a Banach space. Below is my attempt and I was wondering if it's ok. I know I have to show that $C$ is a complete normed space. Clearly, $\\|f\\| \\geqslant 0$ and $\\|f\\|=0 \\Leftrightarrow f=0$. $\\|cf \\|=\\max~|cf(x)|=|c|\\max |f(x)|=|c| \\cdot \\|f\\|$. $\\|f+g\\|=\\max~|f(x)+g(x)|\\leq \\max~|f(x)|+\\max~|g(x)|=\\|f\\|+ \\|g\\|$. So $C$ is a normed space. Next, I show that every Cauchy sequence in $C$ is convergent. Let $\\{f_n\\}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $C$. Let $\\varepsilon \\gt 0.$ Then $\\exists$ an $N_1$ such that $$ \\max~|f_n(x)-f_m(x)| \\lt \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}$$\nfor $n, m \\gt N_1$ and $x\\in[0,1]$. But there is a subsequence $f_{k_n} $, which converges to $f$. So $\\exists$ an $N_2$ such that\n$$ \\max~\\left|f_{k_n} - f\\right|\\lt \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}$$\nfor each $n\\gt N_2$. Now Let $N = \\max\\{N_1, N_2\\}$, if $n \\gt N$ then $k_n \\geqslant n\\gt N$. So we have\n$$ \\max~\\left|f_n(x) - f(x)\\right| \\leqslant \\max~\\left|f_n - f_{k_n}\\right| + \\max~\\left| f_{k_n} - f\\right| \\lt\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} = \\varepsilon.$$ \nThus, $\\|f_n-f\\| \\to 0$ as $n\\to \\infty$. $\\quad \\square$ Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Where do you get this subsequence $\\{f_{n_k}\\}_k$? Since a Cauchy sequence is convergent if and only if it has a convergent subsequence, you're essentially assuming the result is true here. Here's a proof that $C[0,1]$ is complete (and thus a Banach space): Suppose $\\{f_n\\}$ is Cauchy in $C[0,1]$. We must show that $f_n$ converges in the $C[0,1]$ norm to  an $f$ in $C[0,1]$. We first identify the \"natural candidate\" for $f$: Since $\\{f_n\\}$ is Cauchy in $C[0,1]$, it follows that $\\{f_n(x)\\}$ is Cauchy in $\\Bbb R$ for each $x\\in[0,1]$. This observation, together with the fact that  $\\Bbb R$ is complete, gives us the well-defined function $f:[0,1]\\rightarrow\\Bbb R$ whose rule is  $f(x)=\\lim f_n(x)$. Since the terms of $\\{f_n\\}$ get uniformly close to each other, we expect $f$ to be\nuniformly close to  $f_m$ for large $m$: Now let $\\epsilon>0$ and choose $M$ so that $\\|f_n-f_m\\|_{C[0,1]}<\\epsilon$ for $n, m\\ge M$.\nThen for each $m>M$ and for any $x\\in[0,1]$:\n$$\n\\tag{1}\n|f(x)-f_m(x)|=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}|f_n(x)-f_m(x)|\\le \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\|f_m-f_n \\|_{C[0,1]}\\le\\epsilon.\n$$ And, we finish up with some hand waving that should not seem arcane to someone studying  Banach spaces: From $(1)$, it follows that  $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$.  From this, it follows that  $f\\in C[0,1]$ (a uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous) and that\n $f_n$ converges to $f$ in $C[0,1]$. Edit: A comment above leads me to remark: $f$ is indeed continuous: Given $x\\in[0,1]$ and $\\epsilon>0$, choose $m$ so that $||f_n-f\\,||_{C[0,1]}<\\epsilon/3$ for $n\\ge m$ and choose $\\delta>0$ such that $|f_m(x)-f_m(y)|\\le \\epsilon/3$ for all $y$. Then if $|x-y|<\\delta$:\n$$\n|f(x)-f(y)| \\le|f(x)-f_m(x)|+|f_m(x)-f_m(y)|+|f_m(y)-f(y)|<\\epsilon.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem following the user's example. The original question is about showing that C[0,1] is a Banach space. The user provided their attempt, which includes verifying the norm properties and then proving completeness by showing every Cauchy sequence converges.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem defines C as the space of continuous functions on [0,1] with the maximum norm. The key assumptions here are about the space, the norm definition, and the properties needed for a Banach space (complete normed space). The user also mentioned verifying the norm axioms: non-negativity, scalar multiplication, triangle inequality, and the zero condition. Then, they proceed to show that every Cauchy sequence converges in the space.\n\nSo, for the assumptions, each should be a single condition on one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. C is the space of all continuous functions on [0,1].\n2. The norm of f is defined as the maximum of |f(x)| over [0,1].\n3. The norm satisfies non-negativity (||f|| ≥ 0).\n4. The norm satisfies ||f|| = 0 if and only if f is the zero function.\n5. The norm is absolutely homogeneous (||cf|| = |c|·||f|| for scalar c).\n6. The norm satisfies the triangle inequality (||f + g|| ≤ ||f|| + ||g||).\n7. Every Cauchy sequence in C converges to a function in C.\n\nWait, but some of these are properties that need to be verified, not assumptions. The original problem asks to show that C is a Banach space, which requires verifying that it's a complete normed space. So the actual assumptions given in the problem are the definitions: the space is C[0,1], the norm is the max norm. The rest (norm axioms and completeness) are what need to be proven. Therefore, the assumptions should only include the given definitions, not the properties that are to be proven.\n\nSo the correct assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nC is the space of all continuous functions on [0,1],\nThe norm of f is defined as the maximum of |f(x)| over x in [0,1].\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"Define ||f|| = max |f(x)|\", so that's an explicit assumption. The space C is given as continuous functions on [0,1]. Then the problem is to show that C is a Banach space under this norm. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the given structures, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nTherefore, the user's example only included the assumptions given in the problem, not the steps of the proof. In the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7 (though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, maybe there was a mistake? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem under Assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example was wrong? Because the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Maybe that was an error in the example. But regardless, the user wants me to follow their format, which in their example included the problem's assumptions, even if there was a mistake. So perhaps I need to focus on the problem's explicit assumptions as given in the original question.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states: Let C=C[0,1] be the space of all continuous functions on [0,1]. Define ||f|| = max |f(x)|. The task is to show that C is a Banach space. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- C is the space of continuous functions on [0,1].\n- The norm is defined as the maximum of |f(x)| over [0,1].\n\nTherefore, these are the two assumptions. The rest (norm properties and completeness) are parts of the proof. The problem is to show that with these assumptions, C is a Banach space.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nC is the space of all continuous functions on the interval [0,1],\nThe norm of a function f in C is defined as the maximum of |f(x)| over x in [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nShow that C is a Banach space.\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, the assumption included the divisibility by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". But that might have been a mistake. However, since the user provided that example, maybe they want to extract all conditions from the problem statement, even if they are part of the proof. Wait, no. The user's instruction says: \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem\". The example seems to have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). That suggests maybe the user made a mistake in their example, but I need to follow their format.\n\nWait, looking back: The original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So that's an error in the example. Therefore, maybe the user intended to list the problem's given conditions as assumptions. In this case, the problem's given conditions for the Banach space question are the space C[0,1] with the max norm. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- The space is C[0,1], i.e., all continuous functions on [0,1].\n- The norm is defined as ||f|| = max_{x ∈ [0,1]} |f(x)|.\n\nThe problem is to prove that C is a Banach space under this norm.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those two as assumptions, and the problem statement is to show it's a Banach space.",
