    "Content": "This problem is so hard that I cannot figure it out. I hope you guys can give me a small push on how to tackle this problem, as I have been thinking about this for, like a week. Here's the problem: Problem Given a circle with center O , radius R (denoted as ( O ; R )), and a point A exterior to ( O ). From A , draw 2 separate tangent line segments AB , and AC to ( O ) ( B , C are tangent points). Let D be the intersection of the line segment AO , and ( O ). Choose a point E arbitrarily on the small arc BC . Let F , G be the intersection points of DE , with AB , and AC respectively. Let I be the intersection of CF , and BG ; H be the intersection of AO , and BC . Prove that H , I , and E are collinear points. Picture Any help would be greatly appreciated. Why can't I embed pictures in my post? :((",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $X$ be the point where lines $BC$ and $FG$ meet. Let $J$ be the point where BC intersects $AE$. Let's forget about point $I$ for a moment. Here is the diagram: Observe that $BD$ is the bisector of angle $HBA$, therefore $HB/BA=HD/DA$. Similarly, $HC/CA=HD/DA$. We see that points $B$, $C$ and $D$ all have the same ratio of distances from points $H$ and $A$. It follows that $(O)$ is an Apollonian circle of segment $HA$. Since $E$ is on this circle too, $HE/EA=HD/DA$. It follows that $ED$ is the bisector of angle $HEA$. Now let us have a look at lines $EX$, $EB$, $EJ$, $EH$ and $EC$ and some of their cross-ratios . Let $f$ be the reflection across line $EX$. What we have established above is that $f(EJ)=EH$. It is also an easy exercise to see that $f(EB)=EC$ and $f(EX)=EX$. So, $f$ maps the four lines $EJ$, $EB$, $EC$ and $EX$ to lines $EH$, $EC$, $EB$ and $EX$ respectively. It follows that the corresponding cross-ratios are the same:\n$$\n(EJ,EB;EC,EX) = (EH,EC;EB,EX).\n$$\nTherefore, we have an equality for cross-ratios of points on line $BC$:\n$$\n(J,B;C,X) = (H,C;B,X).\n$$ If we look at the perspective projection from line $BC$ to line $FG$ with center $A$, it sends points $J$, $B$, $C$ and $X$ to $E$, $F$, $G$ and $X$ respectively. Since perspective projections preserve cross-ratios, we have:\n$$\n(E,F;G,X) = (H, C; B, X).\n$$ Now let us look at point $I$ (not shown on my diagram) where $BG$ and $FC$ intersect. Let $g$ be the perspective projection from line $BC$ to line $FG$ with center $I$. It is clear that $g(X)=X$, $g(B)=G$ and $g(C)=F$. $g$ preserves cross-ratios, therefore\n$$\n(H, C; B, X) = (g(H), F; G, X),\n$$\nand so\n$$\n(E,F;G,X) = (g(H), F; G, X).\n$$\nIt follows that $g(H)=E$, which means that $H$, $E$ and $I$ are collinear, QED.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the original question and structure it according to the required format. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement itself needs to be clearly stated.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\nWe have a circle with center O and radius R, denoted as (O; R). Point A is outside the circle. From A, two tangent segments AB and AC are drawn, with B and C as the points of tangency. D is the intersection of AO and the circle. A point E is chosen on the small arc BC. F and G are the intersections of DE with AB and AC respectively. I is the intersection of CF and BG. H is the intersection of AO and BC. The goal is to prove that H, I, and E are collinear.\n\nFirst, let's list all the assumptions:\n\n1. Circle (O; R) has center O and radius R.\n2. Point A is exterior to the circle (O; R).\n3. AB and AC are tangent segments from A to the circle (O; R), with B and C as points of tangency.\n4. D is the intersection point of line segment AO and the circle (O; R).\n5. Point E is arbitrarily chosen on the small arc BC of the circle (O; R).\n6. F is the intersection point of DE and AB.\n7. G is the intersection point of DE and AC.\n8. I is the intersection point of CF and BG.\n9. H is the intersection point of AO and BC.\n\nEach of these points is an assumption about the construction of the figure. Each line addresses a single object and its specific condition or property. For example, AB and AC being tangents from A is one assumption each, but since they're both tangents from the same point, maybe they can be combined? Wait, the instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps splitting them. However, tangents from a single external point to a circle are equal, but here they are two separate tangents. So maybe list AB and AC as two separate tangent segments? Wait, but maybe each tangent is a separate assumption. However, in the example given, assumptions are listed as separate lines but sometimes combine related conditions. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So here, maybe the key is each line is a single condition, even if applied to the same object.\n\nLooking back, the original problem says: \"AB and AC are tangent segments from A to (O)\" — so this is a single condition that two tangents are drawn from A. But according to the example, each assumption should be one property for one object. So perhaps \"AB is a tangent to (O) at B\" and \"AC is a tangent to (O) at C\". But the problem says \"draw two separate tangent line segments AB and AC to (O) (B, C are tangent points)\". So maybe split into two assumptions: AB is a tangent to (O) at B; AC is a tangent to (O) at C. But perhaps in the problem statement, they are considered as two separate tangents from A. Alternatively, the problem might state that A is exterior, so by definition, there are two tangents. But the user wants each assumption line by line.\n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. Circle (O; R) has center O and radius R.\n2. Point A is exterior to circle (O; R).\n3. AB is a tangent segment from A to circle (O; R), tangent at point B.\n4. AC is a tangent segment from A to circle (O; R), tangent at point C.\n5. D is the intersection point of line segment AO and circle (O; R).\n6. Point E is on the small arc BC of circle (O; R).\n7. F is the intersection point of DE and AB.\n8. G is the intersection point of DE and AC.\n9. I is the intersection point of CF and BG.\n10. H is the intersection point of AO and BC.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"D is the intersection of the line segment AO, and (O)\" — so AO is a line segment from A to O, intersecting the circle at D. Since A is exterior, AO passes through the circle, and D is the point where AO enters the circle. So D is between A and O on AO.\n\nPoint E is on the small arc BC, so the arc that's smaller between B and C, not containing D presumably.\n\nF and G are intersections of DE with AB and AC. So DE is a line from D to E; it intersects AB at F and AC at G.\n\nThen I is where CF and BG cross.\n\nH is where AO and BC meet.\n\nWe need to prove H, I, E are colinear.\n\nNow, check if each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. Circle (O; R): center O, radius R. One object (the circle), two properties (center and radius), but perhaps the user wants this as one line: \"Circle (O; R) exists with center O and radius R.\" But the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines, so maybe split if possible. However, here, it's the definition of the circle, so likely one line.\n\n2. Point A is exterior to the circle. Applied to point A.\n\n3. AB is a tangent to the circle at B. Applied to segment AB and point B.\n\n4. AC is a tangent to the circle at C. Similarly.\n\n5. D is the intersection of AO and the circle. So AO is a line segment, D is where it meets the circle.\n\n6. E is on the small arc BC. So E's location is specified.\n\n7. F is the intersection of DE and AB. Defined for F.\n\n8. G is the intersection of DE and AC. Defined for G.\n\n9. I is the intersection of CF and BG. Defined for I.\n\n10. H is the intersection of AO and BC. Defined for H.\n\nEach of these is a single condition applied to one object (the point or line). So that's 10 assumptions. However, in the example given, the user had two assumptions for n: being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps some assumptions can be merged if they pertain to the same object. For example, points B and C being tangent points could be part of the same assumption. Wait, the original problem says \"AB, and AC to (O) (B, C are tangent points)\". So the tangents AB and AC touch the circle at B and C. So maybe combine the tangent conditions into one line: \"AB and AC are tangent to (O) at points B and C respectively.\" But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps splitting into two separate assumptions: AB is tangent at B, AC is tangent at C. However, in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" — both applied to n. So if AB and AC are two different objects (segments), then each would have their own assumption. Alternatively, if they are properties of the same point A, but different segments. It's a bit ambiguous, but to follow the example strictly, perhaps each tangent is a separate assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the problem statement, the user combined them, but the example split them. Wait, the example given by the user had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the original problem, n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13). However, in the formatted assumption, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the example was modified, maybe incorrectly. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. But according to the example given, the user split the conditions into two, even if the original problem didn't state it. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be \"n is an integer\". But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. That seems like an error. Therefore, maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow their format, even if the example has mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem in the example had a mistake, but the user formatted it as such. So, perhaps the user intended that the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but it wasn't in the original problem. Therefore, maybe the example is flawed, but we need to follow the instruction regardless.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem, the key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThus, for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- Circle (O; R) has center O and radius R.\n- Point A is exterior to circle (O; R).\n- AB is a tangent segment to circle (O; R) at point B.\n- AC is a tangent segment to circle (O; R) at point C.\n- D is the intersection point of line segment AO and circle (O; R).\n- Point E is on the small arc BC of circle (O; R).\n- F is the intersection point of DE and AB.\n- G is the intersection point of DE and AC.\n- I is the intersection point of lines CF and BG.\n- H is the intersection point of lines AO and BC.\n\nProblem:\nProve that points H, I, and E are collinear.\n\nThat's the structured problem. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. For example, each tangent is a separate assumption because they are different segments. Each intersection point is defined individually. The problem is to prove collinearity.",
