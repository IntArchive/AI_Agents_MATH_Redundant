    "Content": "Could anyone provide me with a nice proof that the dominance order $\\leq$ on partitions of an integer $n$ satisfies the following: if $\\lambda, \\tau$ are 2 partitions of $n$, then $\\lambda \\leq \\tau \\Longleftrightarrow \\tau ' \\leq \\lambda '$, where $\\lambda'$ is the conjugate partition of $\\lambda$ (i.e. the transpose of the set of 'dots' which $\\lambda$ represents). I feel like there must be a nice clever and concise/intuitive proof of this, but all I can come up with is an ugly brute force approach based on the definition of sums of the components $\\lambda_i$. Could anyone suggest a particularly nice way to obtain this result? Many thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is one of the most fundamental properties of the dominance ordering; one should not be surprised or ashamed at actually using the definition of that ordering in proving it. However, here is an approach that you may find less technical, as it shows the equivalence of the definition of the dominance ordering with a characterisation that makes the anti-symmetry obvious. I will denote the Young diagram of a partition $\\lambda$ by $[\\lambda]$ , considered as a subset of the quarter-lattice $\\mathbf N_{>0}^2$ , of which I will also consider the following subsets: the \"upper half planes\" $H_k=\\{(i,j)\\in\\mathbf N_{>0}^2\\mid i\\leq k\\}$ for $k\\in\\mathbf N$ , and the \"upper right diagonal half planes\" $D_l=\\{(i,j)\\in\\mathbf N_{>0}^2\\mid i-j\\leq l\\}$ for $l\\in\\mathbf Z$ . (One should take the \"half plane\" with a grain of salt: that is what the subsets of $\\mathbf R^2$ defined by the same inequalities look like; in particular note that $H_0=\\emptyset$ .) One can now give the definition of the dominance order as follows. Definition. For two partitions $\\lambda,\\mu$ of the same number $n\\in\\mathbf N$ , one has $\\lambda\\leq\\mu$ if and only if for all $k\\in\\mathbf N$ one has $|[\\lambda]\\cap H_k|\\leq|[\\mu]\\cap H_k|$ . Lemma. For two partitions $\\lambda,\\mu$ of the same number $n\\in\\mathbf N$ , the condition $\\lambda\\leq\\mu$ holds if and only if for all $l\\in\\mathbf Z$ one has $|[\\lambda]\\cap D_l|\\leq|[\\mu]\\cap D_l|$ . Admitting this lemma for now, one easily deduces the anti-symmetry of conjugation: $$\n  \\begin{align}\n  \\lambda\\leq\\mu &\\iff \\forall l\\in\\mathbb Z:|[\\lambda]\\cap D_l|\\leq|[\\mu]\\cap D_l|\n\\\\&\n  \\iff \\forall l\\in\\mathbb Z:|[\\lambda']\\cap D_{-1-l}|\\geq|[\\mu']\\cap D_{-1-l}|\n\\\\&\n  \\iff \\lambda' \\geq \\mu',\n\\\\\\end{align}\n$$ where the middle equivalence comes from the fact that $D_{-1-l}$ is the \"transpose\" of the complement in $\\mathbf N_{>0}^2$ of the set $D_l$ , so that the partial diagrams have been replaced by their transpose complements, and since $|[\\lambda]|=n=|[\\mu]|$ this changes their size from $s$ to $n-s$ . Note that only here do we use $|[\\lambda]|=|[\\mu]|$ , the lemma would be valid for partitions of different sizes (but the partial orders in that setting are nevertheless of no significance). Proof of the lemma. We prove by contraposition: there exists some $k\\in\\mathbf N$ with $|[\\lambda]\\cap H_k|>|[\\mu]\\cap H_k|$ if and only if there exists some $l\\in\\mathbf Z$ such that $|[\\lambda]\\cap D_l|>|[\\mu]\\cap D_l|$ . While the details below may seem a bit technical, the idea is simple: in the first part we pass from $k$ to $l$ using $\\mu$ only, pushing $D_l$ as far to the right as possible while keeping the \"octant\" $H_k\\setminus D_l$ inside the diagram $[\\mu]$ , and in the second part we pass from $l$ to $k$ using $\\lambda$ only, by similarly pushing $H_k$ down as far as possible while keeping the same octant inside the diagram $[\\lambda]$ . Suppose first the existence of such $k\\in\\mathbf N$ with $|[\\lambda]\\cap H_k|>|[\\mu]\\cap H_k|$ . Let $(k,y)$ be the first square of row $k$ that is absent from $[\\mu]$ (so in fact $y=\\mu_k+1$ ), and put $l=k-y$ . Then $[\\mu]\\cap D_l\\subseteq [\\mu]\\cap H_k$ (since any squares $(i,j)$ of $D_l\\setminus H_k$ have $i>k$ and $j\\geq i-l>y$ and therefore $(i,j)\\notin[\\mu]$ ) while $H_k\\setminus D_l\\subseteq[\\mu]$ (the \"maximal\" square $(k,y-1)$ of $H_k\\setminus D_l$ , if it exists, lies in $[\\mu]$ by construction). One thus has $|[\\mu]\\cap D_l|=|[\\mu]\\cap H_k|-|H_k\\setminus D_l|$ , and this suffices to obtain the required inequality: $$\n|[\\lambda]\\cap D_l|\\geq|[\\lambda]\\cap H_k|-|H_k\\setminus D_l|\n >|[\\mu]\\cap H_k|-|H_k\\setminus D_l|=|[\\mu]\\cap D_l|. \n$$ Conversely suppose the existence of $l\\in\\mathbf Z$ such that $|[\\lambda]\\cap D_l|>|[\\mu]\\cap D_l|$ . Let $k\\geq\\max(0,l+1)$ be minimal such that $(k+1,k-l)\\notin[\\lambda]$ . By the choice of $k$ we have $[\\lambda]\\cap D_l\\subseteq [\\lambda]\\cap H_k$ (the minimal square $(k+1,k-l+1$ of $D_l\\setminus H_k$ does not lie in $[\\lambda]$ ), and $H_k\\setminus D_l\\subseteq[\\lambda]$ (the maximal square $(k,k-l-1)$ of $H_k\\setminus D_l$ , if it exists, lies in $[\\lambda])$ . Then by a similar argument as above, $$\n  |[\\lambda]\\cap H_k| = |[\\lambda]\\cap D_l|+|H_k\\setminus D_l|\n  >|[\\mu]\\cap D_l|+|H_k\\setminus D_l|\n  \\geq |[\\mu]\\cap H_l|.\n$$ It should be noted that the values chosen for $l$ respectively $k$ are not always the unique ones that will make the argument work, just the minimal respectively maximal ones.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants a proof that the dominance order on partitions of an integer n satisfies that λ ≤ τ if and only if τ' ≤ λ', where the primes denote conjugate partitions. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. The dominance order, also called the natural order, is defined such that for two partitions λ and τ of n, λ ≤ τ if for all k ≥ 1, the sum of the first k parts of λ is less than or equal to the sum of the first k parts of τ. The conjugate partition λ' is obtained by transposing the Young diagram of λ, so the parts of λ' are the lengths of the columns of the Young diagram of λ.\n\nThe problem is asking for a duality proof, showing that the dominance order reverses when taking conjugates. The user mentioned that brute-forcing via the definition with component sums is ugly, so I need a more elegant approach.\n\nI remember that there's a connection between dominance order and majorization in mathematics. Maybe concepts from majorization theory can help. Alternatively, thinking about the relationship between a partition and its conjugate in terms of their diagrams.\n\nLet me think about the definition of conjugate partitions. For a partition λ = (λ₁, λ₂, ..., λ_m), the conjugate partition λ' has parts λ'_i equal to the number of j such that λ_j ≥ i. So, each part of λ' is the height of the corresponding column in the Young diagram.\n\nNow, the dominance order involves comparing cumulative sums. For λ ≤ τ, we have that for all k, λ₁ + ... + λ_k ≤ τ₁ + ... + τ_k. The conjugate condition would relate the columns of the diagrams. Since the conjugate switches rows and columns, the sum of the first k parts of λ' would correspond to the sum of the first k columns of λ, which is the number of boxes in the first k columns. But how does this relate to the original partitions' sums?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept that the conjugate reverses the dominance order. If I can find a way to relate the sum conditions of the original partitions to those of their conjugates, maybe through some duality in the inequalities.\n\nAnother approach might involve using the Robinson-Schensted correspondence or some combinatorial bijection, but that might be overcomplicating it. Maybe induction on the number of parts? Or considering the complement partitions?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think about the definition of the conjugate partition in terms of the original. For each i, the conjugate partition λ' has λ'_i equal to the number of parts of λ that are at least i. So, if we have λ ≤ τ in the dominance order, then for each k, the sum of the first k parts of λ is ≤ the sum of the first k parts of τ. How does this translate to their conjugates?\n\nSuppose we have λ ≤ τ. Then, we need to show that τ' ≤ λ'. Since τ' and λ' are partitions of n as well. The dominance order for the conjugates would require that for each k, the sum of the first k parts of τ' is ≤ the sum of the first k parts of λ'. \n\nBut the sum of the first k parts of τ' is the total number of boxes in the first k columns of τ, which is the same as the sum over i from 1 to k of τ'_i. But τ'_i is the number of parts of τ that are ≥ i. Therefore, the sum of τ'_1 + τ'_2 + ... + τ'_k is equal to the number of pairs (i,j) where j ≤ k and τ_i ≥ j. Similarly, the sum for λ' would be the same for λ.\n\nBut how to connect this to the original dominance condition? Maybe using some kind of duality in the way the sums are counted. Alternatively, think of the conjugate partition in terms of its rows and columns, and relate the dominance order to the transposed diagrams.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the fact that the dominance order can be characterized by the existence of a certain sequence of transformations (like moving boxes in the Young diagram), and then showing that conjugation reverses these transformations. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider using generating functions or some symmetric function theory. The dominance order is related to the inclusion of Young subgroups, and conjugation might correspond to some duality in the symmetric group representations. But this might be more advanced than needed.\n\nWait, here's a more straightforward approach. Let's use the definition of the conjugate partition and express the sum conditions for dominance.\n\nSuppose that λ ≤ τ. That means for all k, λ₁ + ... + λ_k ≤ τ₁ + ... + τ_k. We need to show that for all m, τ'_1 + ... + τ'_m ≤ λ'_1 + ... + λ'_m.\n\nNow, τ'_1 + ... + τ'_m is the number of boxes in the first m columns of τ. Similarly for λ'. But the number of boxes in the first m columns is equal to the number of rows in τ that are at least m. Wait, no. Wait, τ'_i is the number of parts of τ that are ≥ i. So, summing τ'_1 to τ'_m gives the total number of parts of τ that are ≥ 1, ≥2, ..., ≥m. Wait, but that's not exactly the case. Wait, each τ'_i counts the number of parts ≥i. So, summing from 1 to m, it's the total number of parts of τ that are ≥1 (which is just the number of parts), plus the number of parts ≥2, ..., up to ≥m. But this counts how many times each part is counted. For example, a part of size k in τ would be counted in τ'_1, τ'_2, ..., τ'_k. So the sum τ'_1 + ... + τ'_m is equal to the sum over all parts of τ of min(part, m). Similarly for λ.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Let's formalize this. For a partition τ, the sum τ'_1 + τ'_2 + ... + τ'_m is equal to the sum over each part τ_i of min(τ_i, m). Because each part τ_i contributes 1 to each τ'_j for j from 1 up to τ_i. So, if τ_i ≥ m, it contributes m to the sum. If τ_i < m, it contributes τ_i. Therefore, the total sum is the sum over all τ_i of min(τ_i, m).\n\nSimilarly, the sum λ'_1 + ... + λ'_m is the sum over all λ_i of min(λ_i, m).\n\nSo, to show that τ'_1 + ... + τ'_m ≤ λ'_1 + ... + λ'_m, we need to show that sum_{i} min(τ_i, m) ≤ sum_{i} min(λ_i, m).\n\nBut how does this relate to the original dominance condition λ ≤ τ?\n\nThe original dominance condition is that for all k, sum_{i=1}^k λ_i ≤ sum_{i=1}^k τ_i.\n\nWe need to connect these two. Let me think. Suppose we have λ ≤ τ. Then, for each k, the sum of the first k parts of λ is ≤ that of τ. How does that affect the sum of min(λ_i, m) over all i?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum of min(λ_i, m) over i can be written as the sum over i=1 to m of λ'_i. Wait, no, because λ'_i is the number of parts of λ that are ≥ i. So, sum_{j=1}^m λ'_j = sum_{i=1}^\\infty min(λ_i, m). Because for each λ_i, it contributes 1 to each λ'_j for j=1 to λ_i. So, if λ_i ≥ m, it contributes m. If λ_i < m, it contributes λ_i. Hence, sum_{j=1}^m λ'_j = sum_{i=1}^\\infty min(λ_i, m). Similarly for τ.\n\nTherefore, the sum sum_{j=1}^m τ'_j = sum_{i=1}^\\infty min(τ_i, m), and we need to show this is ≤ sum_{i=1}^\\infty min(λ_i, m).\n\nBut how does the dominance condition λ ≤ τ (which is about sums of the first k parts) relate to the sum of min(λ_i, m)?\n\nMaybe we can use the concept of majorization. In majorization, there's a result that relates to the conjugate order. Wait, I think that the conjugating partitions reverses the dominance order, which is what this problem is stating.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum of min(λ_i, m) over i is equal to the number of boxes in the first m columns of λ's Young diagram. Similarly for τ. So, if we can show that τ has more boxes in the first m columns than λ, then τ' ≤ λ'. But wait, the problem states that λ ≤ τ implies τ' ≤ λ', which would mean that if λ is dominated by τ, then τ' is dominated by λ'. So, in terms of columns, if the original condition is about rows, then the conjugate condition is about columns.\n\nBut how to make this precise?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that dominance order can also be defined in terms of the conjugate. There's a theorem that says λ ≤ τ if and only if τ' ≤ λ'. But the user is asking for a proof of that.\n\nAlternatively, use an intermediate step with the concept of partitions being comparable via the dominance order if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of moves where you move a box from a longer row to a shorter row. But conjugation would reverse the direction of such moves.\n\nWait, perhaps induction. Let's try induction on n. Suppose for all partitions of n-1, the statement holds. Then, for partitions of n... Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to use the definition of conjugate partitions and the dominance order in terms of their generating functions or using some duality in the way the sums are structured.\n\nWait, here's another idea. For any partition λ, the sum of the first k parts, λ₁ + ... + λ_k, is equal to the maximum number of boxes that can be covered by the first k rows. Similarly, the conjugate partition's sum λ'_1 + ... + λ'_m is the maximum number of boxes covered by the first m columns.\n\nIf λ ≤ τ, then for every k, the first k rows of λ cover fewer boxes than those of τ. But the columns of τ would then be \"shorter\" in some way, leading to τ' being dominated by λ'.\n\nBut I need to make this precise. Let's think in terms of the complement.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the dominance order is equivalent to the inclusion of the Young diagram of one partition in the other when adjusted appropriately. But conjugation would flip the diagram, so inclusion would reverse.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for each k, the sum of the first k parts of λ is ≤ sum of first k parts of τ. This implies that for each m, the number of parts of λ that are ≥ m is ≤ the number of parts of τ that are ≥ m. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, the number of parts of λ that are ≥ m is λ'_m. So, if we can show that λ'_m ≥ τ'_m for all m, then τ' ≤ λ'. Because the dominance order requires that for all k, the sum of the first k parts of τ' is ≤ sum of first k parts of λ'.\n\nBut wait, if λ'_m ≥ τ'_m for all m, then summing up would give that τ'_1 + ... + τ'_k ≤ λ'_1 + ... + λ'_k for all k, which is exactly what we need for τ' ≤ λ'.\n\nSo, if we can show that λ ≤ τ implies λ'_m ≥ τ'_m for all m, then we're done. Let's see.\n\nSuppose λ ≤ τ. For each m, we need to show that λ'_m ≥ τ'_m. Remember that λ'_m is the number of parts of λ that are ≥ m. Similarly for τ'_m.\n\nSo, to show that λ has at least as many parts of size ≥m as τ does. But how does the dominance condition λ ≤ τ imply this?\n\nAssume, for contradiction, that there exists some m where λ'_m < τ'_m. That would mean τ has more parts of size ≥m than λ. Let's denote the number of such parts as p = τ'_m and q = λ'_m, with p > q.\n\nThe sum of the first p parts of τ is at least p*m, since each of the first p parts is ≥m. Similarly, the sum of the first q parts of λ is at least q*m. But since p > q, and λ ≤ τ, the sum of the first p parts of λ must be ≤ sum of first p parts of τ. But if λ has only q parts ≥m, then the sum of the first p parts of λ would be at most q*m + (p - q)*something < q*m + (p - q)*(m - 1). Because after the first q parts, the remaining parts are ≤ m-1. So sum of first p parts of λ ≤ q*m + (p - q)*(m -1) = q + p*(m -1) - q*(m -1) = p*(m -1) + q*(1 - (m -1)) = p*(m -1) + q*(2 - m). On the other hand, sum of first p parts of τ is at least p*m. So:\n\np*m ≤ sum_{i=1}^p τ_i ≥ sum_{i=1}^p λ_i ≤ p*(m -1) + q*(2 - m)\n\nBut since p > q, and m ≥1, this would imply:\n\np*m ≤ p*(m -1) + q*(2 - m)\n\nRearranged:\n\np*m - p*(m -1) ≤ q*(2 - m)\n\np ≤ q*(2 - m)\n\nBut since m ≥1, the right-hand side is q*(2 - m) ≤ q*1 (if m=1, it's q*1; m=2, q*0; m≥3, negative). But p > q, so if m=1, then p ≤ q*1, which contradicts p > q. If m=2, the RHS is 0, but p > q ≥0, which is impossible. For m ≥3, RHS is negative, but p is positive, which is impossible. Therefore, our assumption leads to a contradiction. Hence, λ'_m ≥ τ'_m for all m.\n\nTherefore, for all m, λ'_m ≥ τ'_m. Hence, summing from 1 to k, we get τ'_1 + ... + τ'_k ≤ λ'_1 + ... + λ'_k for all k. Therefore, τ' ≤ λ'. \n\nSimilarly, the converse can be shown by applying the same argument to τ' and λ' since (λ')' = λ.\n\nThis completes the proof. The key step was showing that the number of parts of λ greater than or equal to m is at least as many as those of τ when λ ≤ τ, which then translates to the conjugate partitions satisfying the reverse dominance order.",
