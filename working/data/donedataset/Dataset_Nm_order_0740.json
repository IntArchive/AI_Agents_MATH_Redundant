    "Content": "I am trying to understand Apery's 1978 proof that $\\zeta(3) = \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}$ is irrational. The idea behind the proof is to find an 'accelerated' series for $\\zeta(3)$ which converges too fast to $\\zeta(3)$, thus proving that $\\zeta(3)$ cannot be rational. In particular, a particular quantity is defined: $$e_{n,k} = \\displaystyle \\sum_{m=1}^k \\frac{(-1)^{m-1} (m!)^2 (n-m)!}{2m^3 (n+m)!},\\quad k \\leq n.$$ The key is to show that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} e_{n,k} = 0$ uniformly in $k$, and I have no idea why this sum converges to 0. Any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By the triangular inequality, $|e_{n,k}|\\leqslant\\frac12 a_n$ with\n$$\na_n=\\sum_{m=1}^nb_{n,m},\\qquad b_{n,m}=\\frac{(m!)^2(n-m)!}{m^3(n+m)!},\n$$\nhence the desired uniform convergence holds as soon as $a_n\\to0$. To prove that $a_n\\to0$, note that\n$$\nb_{n,m}=\\frac{(m-1)!(m-1)!(n-m)!}{m(n+m)!}\\leqslant\\frac{(m-1)!(m-1)!(n-m)!}{(n+m)!},\n$$\nand use twice the fact that $i!j!\\leqslant (i+j)!$ for every nonnegative integers $i$ and $j$. This yields\n$$\nb_{n,m}\\leqslant\\frac{(n+m-2)!}{(n+m)!}=\\frac1{(n+m-1)(n+m)}=\\frac1{n+m-1}-\\frac1{n+m}.\n$$\nThus $a_n$ is bounded by a telescoping sum, namely\n$$\na_n\\leqslant\\sum_{m=1}^n\\left(\\frac1{n+m-1}-\\frac1{n+m}\\right)=\\frac1{n}-\\frac1{2n}=\\frac1{2n},\n$$\nThis shows that $|e_{n,k}|\\leqslant\\frac1{4n}$ for every $n\\geqslant1$ and uniformly over $k\\leqslant n$, hence the proof is complete. Edit One can refine the estimates above, taking into account the variations of the sequence  $(b_{n,m})_{1\\leqslant m\\leqslant n}$ for some fixed $n$, which is nonincreasing on $1\\leqslant m\\leqslant m_n$ for some $m_n\\approx n/\\sqrt2$ and nondecreasing on $m_n\\leqslant m\\leqslant n$. Thus, $|e_{n,k}|\\leqslant\\frac12  b_{n,1}+\\frac12 b_{n,n}$. Hence, $n^2e_{n,k}\\to\\frac12 $ uniformly over $k$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving that a certain sequence e_{n,k} converges to 0 uniformly in k as n approaches infinity. This sequence is part of Apéry's proof of the irrationality of ζ(3). \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem defines e_{n,k} as a sum from m=1 to k of [ (-1)^{m-1} (m!)^2 (n - m)! ] / [2m^3 (n + m)! ], where k ≤ n. So the assumptions here are that n and k are integers with k ≤ n, and the expression involves factorials and alternating signs.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that the limit as n approaches infinity of e_{n,k} is zero uniformly in k. So the key here is that the convergence is uniform in k, meaning that the rate at which e_{n,k} approaches zero doesn't depend on the choice of k as long as k ≤ n. \n\nPossible assumptions: each term in the sum involves m from 1 to k, and k is less than or equal to n. Also, the terms involve factorials which might be simplified or approximated using Stirling's formula. The alternating sign might lead to cancellation, but since it's a sum from m=1 to k, maybe each term individually becomes small as n grows, even for the maximum m=k. \n\nSo the main objects here are n, k, m. The problem is to show the uniform convergence to 0. The assumptions would include that k ≤ n, m ranges from 1 to k, and the expression for each term in the sum. But in the example given, the assumptions were about the variables involved. For instance, in the previous example, n was an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- n and k are positive integers with k ≤ n.\n- The sum is over m from 1 to k.\n- Each term in the sum is [ (-1)^{m-1} (m!)^2 (n - m)! ] / [2m^3 (n + m)! ].\n\nBut the problem is to show the limit as n→infty of e_{n,k} is 0 uniformly in k. So maybe the key is to bound each term in the sum and show that the total sum tends to zero regardless of k. So each term might decrease rapidly enough as n increases, even when k is up to n. But since k ≤ n, maybe when n is large, k can also be large, but the individual terms decay faster. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio (n - m)! / (n + m)! can be simplified. Let's think: (n + m)! = (n + m)(n + m -1)...(n - m +1)(n - m)! So (n - m)! / (n + m)! = 1 / [(n + m)(n + m -1)...(n - m +1)]. That product in the denominator is from n - m +1 to n + m. Which is a product of 2m terms. So this ratio is 1 over the product of 2m consecutive integers starting from n - m +1. For fixed m, as n becomes large, this product is roughly (n)^{2m}, so the ratio is O(n^{-2m}). Then multiplied by (m!)^2 / (2m^3). So each term is O(n^{-2m} * m!^2 / m^3). For fixed m, as n→infty, each term tends to 0. But when m can grow with n, since k ≤ n, we need to ensure that even when m is large (up to k, which could be up to n), the term still is small. Wait, but if m is large, like m ~ n, then (n - m)! is (n - m)! which, if m is close to n, then n - m is small. Wait, if m approaches n, then (n - m)! is factorial of a small number, but (n + m)! would be factorial of something like 2n. So the ratio becomes (small factorial)/ (2n factorial), which is extremely small. So even for the largest m=k=n, the term would be very small. \n\nBut maybe the key is that each term in the sum is bounded by something that decays sufficiently fast, so that the sum over m=1 to k (which could be up to n) is still summable to zero. \n\nBut to structure this as per the required format, the assumptions should list each condition. The problem is to show the uniform convergence. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n and k are positive integers with k ≤ n.\n\n- For each m in {1, 2, ..., k}, the term is [ (-1)^{m-1} (m!)^2 (n - m)! ] / [2m^3 (n + m)! ].\n\nBut wait, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- k is a positive integer with k ≤ n.\n\n- The sequence e_{n,k} is defined as the sum from m=1 to k of [ (-1)^{m-1} (m!)^2 (n - m)! ] / [2m^3 (n + m)! ].\n\nBut maybe splitting even more:\n\n- For each positive integer n, k is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\n- For each m in {1, 2, ..., k}, the term [ (-1)^{m-1} (m!)^2 (n - m)! ] / [2m^3 (n + m)! ] is defined.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's assumptions are just the definitions given. The user defines e_{n,k} as that sum, under k ≤ n, so the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- k is a positive integer with k ≤ n.\n\n- The quantity e_{n,k} is defined as the sum over m=1 to k of [ (-1)^{m-1} (m!)^2 (n - m)! ] / [2m^3 (n + m)! ].\n\nSo in the assumption section, each line is one condition. The problem is to show that the limit as n→infty of e_{n,k} is 0 uniformly in k. Therefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a positive integer,\n\nk is a positive integer with k ≤ n,\n\ne_{n,k} is defined as the sum from m=1 to k of [ (-1)^{m-1} (m!)^2 (n - m)! ] / [2m^3 (n + m)! ].\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} e_{n,k} = 0$$ uniformly in k.\n\nThat seems to fit the required format. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The problem is stated clearly. The example given had a similar structure, listing assumptions about the variable and the expression.",
