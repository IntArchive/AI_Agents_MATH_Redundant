    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $h(x) = \\min\\{f(x),g(x)\\}$. Suppose $x_0$ is such that $f(x_0) = g(x_0)$. We want to show $h$ is continuous at $x_0$. Take $\\epsilon > 0$, then there is a $\\delta_f$ so that $|f(x) - f(x_0)| < \\epsilon$ for $|x-x_0| < \\delta_f$, and similarly for $g$ and some $\\delta_g$ (with the same $\\epsilon$). Use this, and the fact that $h(x_0) = f(x_0) = g(x_0)$ to show that $|h(x) - h(x_0)| < \\epsilon$ whether $h(x) = f(x)$ or $h(x) = g(x)$ as long as $|x-x_0| < \\delta$ for some $\\delta$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"Prove that the min and max of 2 continuous function are continuous\". The question body says: \"Prove that if f and g are continuous functions then so are min{f(x),g(x)} and max{f(x),g(x)}. I know this is true when f and g are not intersecting each other, then I can compare them. However, I don't know how to prove it's true when they are intersect.\"\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentions that f and g are continuous functions. So the main assumptions here are about the continuity of f and g. The problem is to prove that their min and max are also continuous. The user also mentions the case where they don't intersect, but the key point here is handling when they do intersect. However, in the problem statement itself, the user doesn't specify any restrictions on f and g other than continuity. So there are no additional conditions like differentiability, domain restrictions, or intersections.\n\nWait, the original example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, that wasn't stated. Wait, no, looking back, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Because 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem actually requires that n is such that it works for both 7 and 13. But maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Hmm, but regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nSo for the current problem, the user's question is to prove that if f and g are continuous, then min and max are continuous. The assumptions here are that f and g are continuous. The problem is to prove the continuity of min and max. There's no mention of any other conditions, like the functions intersecting or not. The user's own comment mentions that they know how to handle the non-intersecting case but not the intersecting one, but the actual problem statement doesn't have any restrictions. So the assumptions should just be that f and g are continuous functions. Since the problem is general, not assuming anything about intersections, the formatted problem shouldn't include that as an assumption. So the assumptions list should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a continuous function,\ng is a continuous function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that min{f(x),g(x)} and max{f(x),g(x)} are continuous functions.\n\nI think that's it. The user's confusion about intersections is part of their thought process, but the actual problem doesn't impose any restrictions on whether f and g intersect or not. Therefore, the formatted problem should only include the continuity of f and g as assumptions.",
