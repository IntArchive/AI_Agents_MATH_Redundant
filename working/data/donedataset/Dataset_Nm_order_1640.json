    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm going to assume you mean (1) symmetric about $0$, and (2) distributions for which the odd-order moments actually exist.  Under these assumptions, yes. In the continuous case, the $n$th moment for a distribution with pdf $f(x)$ exists and is $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^n f(x) \\,dx,$$\nexactly when the integral converges.  So, what does it mean for the integral to converge? Remember that we define $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^n f(x) \\,dx$ to be $$ \\int_{-\\infty}^0 x^n f(x) \\, dx + \\int_0^{\\infty} x^n f(x) \\, dx.$$  (Well, we could choose some point other than $0$ to split the integral, but $0$ works fine.)  Convergence of $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^n f(x) \\,dx$ is equivalent to the convergence of both of these integrals.  Existence of the $n$th odd-order moment, then, is equivalent to $\\int_{-\\infty}^0 x^n f(x) \\, dx$ and $\\int_0^{\\infty} x^n f(x) \\, dx$ both being finite. Suppose $\\int_0^{\\infty} x^n f(x) \\, dx = A$.  If we let $u = -x$, then $$\\int_{-\\infty}^0 x^n f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{\\infty}^0 (-u)^n f(-u) \\, (-du) = (-1)^n \\int_0^{\\infty} u^n f(-u) \\, du = - \\int_0^{\\infty} u^n f(u) \\, du  = -A,$$\nwhere the first step is legitimate because the integral converges and the third step follows because $n$ is odd and $f$ is symmetric about the origin. Thus, if the $n$th odd-order moment exists, it is equal to $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^n f(x) \\,dx = -A + A = 0.$ The discrete case for $n$ odd is analogous.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking if all odd-order moments are zero for any symmetrical distribution and how to prove it. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a symmetrical distribution is. A distribution is symmetric about a point, usually the mean, if the probability density function (pdf) satisfies f(a + x) = f(a - x) for all x, where 'a' is the point of symmetry. For example, the normal distribution is symmetric about its mean.\n\nNext, moments. The n-th moment about the mean is E[(X - μ)^n]. If the distribution is symmetric, then for every positive x, the contribution of μ + x and μ - x to the moment should be considered. For odd moments, say n is odd, (X - μ)^n would be an odd power. So, (x)^n is an odd function. Since the distribution is symmetric, the areas under the curve for x and -x would be the same, but when multiplied by x^n (which is negative for -x when n is odd), the contributions would cancel out. Therefore, integrating over the entire distribution would result in zero.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"symmetrical distribution\" without specifying around zero or the mean. Maybe I should clarify. If the symmetry is around a point a, then the moments should be taken about that point a. If the moments are taken about the point of symmetry, then the odd moments would indeed be zero. However, if the moments are taken about a different point, they might not be zero. But usually, moments are considered about the mean, and for symmetric distributions, the mean is the point of symmetry. So the assumption here is that the distribution is symmetric about its mean, and the moments are central moments (about the mean).\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are that the distribution is symmetric about its mean and that we're considering central moments (odd-order). So in the problem statement, the user might not have specified central moments, but in the context of moments, it's often implied. However, to be precise, the problem should state that the moments are about the point of symmetry.\n\nPutting this together, the assumptions need to include that the distribution is symmetric about its mean (or a point a), and the moments are taken about that point. Then, all odd-order moments would be zero because the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around the point of symmetry would cancel out.\n\nSo, structuring the problem accordingly:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The distribution is symmetric about its mean (or a specific point a).\n- The moments considered are central moments (about the mean) or about the point of symmetry a.\n- The odd-order moments in question are integers greater than or equal to 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that all odd-order moments of a symmetric distribution about its mean are equal to zero.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"for every symmetrical distribution all odd-order moments are equal to zero\". The answer is yes if we consider central moments. However, if the distribution is symmetric about a point but we take moments about a different point, then the odd moments might not be zero. For example, if a distribution is symmetric about a, but we take moments about b ≠ a, then E[(X - b)^n] might not be zero for odd n. So the key assumption is that the moments are taken about the point of symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the problem needs to specify that the moments are taken about the center of symmetry. The original question might have omitted this, so in structuring the problem, we should make this assumption explicit.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have assumptions:\n\n- The distribution is symmetric about a point a.\n- The moments are taken about point a.\n- The order of the moment is an odd integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that all odd-order moments about point a are equal to zero for a distribution symmetric about a.\n\nBut the original question didn't mention the point a. So perhaps the user implicitly assumes central moments (about the mean), which is the point of symmetry. So maybe the assumptions should be:\n\n- The distribution is symmetric about its mean.\n- The moments considered are central moments (about the mean).\n- The order of the moment is an odd integer.\n\nBut the original problem just says \"symmetrical distribution\". To cover all cases, we need to make sure that the moments are taken about the center of symmetry. So structuring the problem with those assumptions.",
