    "Content": "I was messing around with the definition of the derivative, trying to work out the formulas for the common functions using limits. I hit a roadblock, however, while trying to find the derivative of $e^x$. The process went something like this: $$\\begin{align}\n(e^x)' &= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{e^{x+h}-e^x}{h} \\\\\n&= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{e^xe^h-e^x}{h} \\\\\n&= \\lim_{h \\to 0} e^x\\frac{e^{h}-1}{h} \\\\\n&= e^x \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{e^h-1}{h}\n\\end{align}\n$$ I can show that $\\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{e^h-1}{h} = 1$ using L'Hôpital's, but it kind of defeats the purpose of working out the derivative, so I want to prove it in some other way. I've been trying, but I can't work anything out. Could someone give a hint?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As to your comment: Consider the differential equation $$y - \\left( {1 + \\frac{x}{n}} \\right)y' = 0$$ It's solution is clearly $$y_n={\\left( {1 + \\frac{x}{n}} \\right)^n}$$ If we let $n \\to \\infty$ \"in the equation\" one gets $$y - y' = 0$$ One should expect that the solution to this is precisely $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} y_n =y=\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1+\\frac x n \\right)^n := e^x$$ Also note\n$$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } {\\left( {1 + \\frac{x}{n}} \\right)^n} = \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } {\\left( {1 + \\frac{x}{{xn}}} \\right)^{xn}} = \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } {\\left[ {{{\\left( {1 + \\frac{1}{n}} \\right)}^n}} \\right]^x}$$ My approach is the following: I have as a definition of $\\log x$ the following: $$\\log x :=\\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{x^k-1}{k}$$ Another one would be $$\\log x = \\int_1^x \\frac{dt}t$$\nAny ways, the importance here is that one can define $e$ to be the unique number such that $$\\log e =1$$ so that by definition $$\\log e =\\lim_{k \\to 0} \\frac{e^k-1}{k}=1$$ From another path, we can define $e^x$ as the inverse of the logarithm. Since $$(\\log x)'=\\frac 1 x$$ the inverse derivative theorem tells us $$(e^x)'=\\frac{1}{(\\log y)'}$$ where $y=e^x$ $$(e^x)'=\\frac{1}{(1/y)}$$ $$(e^x)'=y=e^x$$ The looking at the difference quotient, one sees that by definition one needs $$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{h \\to 0} \\frac{{{e^{x + h}} - {e^x}}}{h} = {e^x}\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{h \\to 0} \\frac{{{e^h} - 1}}{h} = {e^x}$$ so that the limit of the expression is $1$. One can also retrieve from the definition of the logarithm that $$\\eqalign{\n  & \\frac{x}{{x + 1}} <\\log \\left( {1 + x} \\right) < x  \\cr \n  & \\frac{1}{{x + 1}}  < \\frac{{\\log \\left( {1 + x} \\right)}}{x}  <1 \\cr} $$ Thus $$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{x \\to 0} \\frac{{\\log \\left( {1 + x} \\right)}}{x} = 1$$ a change of variables $e^h-1=x$ gives the result you state. In general, we have to go back to the definition of $e^x$. If one defines \n$${e^x} = 1 + x + \\frac{{{x^2}}}{2} +  \\cdots $$ Then $$\\frac{{{e^x} - 1}}{x} = 1 + \\frac{x}{2} +  \\cdots $$ $$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{x \\to 0} \\frac{{{e^x} - 1}}{x} = \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{x \\to 0} \\left( {1 + \\frac{x}{2} +  \\cdots } \\right) = 1$$ from the defintion we just chose.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the limit as x approaches 0 of (e^x - 1)/x is equal to 1 without using L'Hôpital's Rule. They mentioned that using L'Hôpital's would be circular because they're trying to find the derivative of e^x in the first place. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions and possible approaches. Since they are working on the derivative of e^x, the standard approach is to use the definition of the derivative. The derivative of e^x at x=0 is the limit they're looking for. But if we already know the derivative of e^x is e^x, then evaluating at 0 gives 1. However, that's circular if we haven't yet proven that the derivative is e^x.\n\nSo, how else can we compute this limit? One common method is to use the Taylor series expansion of e^x around 0. The expansion is 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... So, subtracting 1 and dividing by x gives 1 + x/2! + x^2/3! + ... which approaches 1 as x approaches 0. But does the user accept using Taylor series? If they are deriving the derivative, maybe they haven't gotten to Taylor series yet, which often relies on derivatives. So that might also be circular.\n\nAnother approach is using the definition of e^x as the solution to the differential equation y' = y with y(0)=1. But again, that's assuming knowledge of the derivative.\n\nAlternatively, use the limit definition of e^x. For example, one definition is that e^x = lim_{n→∞} (1 + x/n)^n. If we use this definition, then perhaps we can expand (1 + x/n)^n using the binomial theorem and see what happens when x approaches 0.\n\nLet me try that. Let's substitute h = x/n, so as h approaches 0, n approaches infinity. But maybe that's complicating things. Wait, if we take e^h = lim_{n→∞} (1 + h/n)^n, then (e^h - 1)/h = [lim_{n→∞} (1 + h/n)^n - 1]/h. Maybe expand (1 + h/n)^n using the binomial theorem:\n\n(1 + h/n)^n = 1 + n*(h/n) + (n(n-1)/2!)*(h/n)^2 + ... + (h/n)^n.\n\nSimplifying each term: 1 + h + (n(n-1)/2!)*(h^2/n^2) + ... + h^n/n^n.\n\nSo, subtracting 1 and dividing by h gives:\n\n[ h + (n(n-1)/2!)*(h^2/n^2) + ... + h^n/n^n ] / h = 1 + (n(n-1)/2!)*(h/n^2) + ... + h^{n-1}/n^n.\n\nAs h approaches 0, but n is going to infinity. Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe take the limit as h approaches 0 first. Let's fix h and take n to infinity. Then (1 + h/n)^n approaches e^h. Then (e^h - 1)/h becomes (e^h - 1)/h. Taking the limit as h approaches 0. But that's the same original limit. Hmm, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the integral definition of e^x. Or use logarithmic properties. Wait, another idea: using the substitution t = e^h - 1. Then as h approaches 0, t approaches 0. So, h = ln(t + 1). Then the limit becomes t / ln(t + 1) as t approaches 0. If we can show that this limit is 1, then the original limit is also 1. But how do we evaluate t / ln(1 + t) as t approaches 0 without using L’Hospital’s? Maybe use the Taylor series expansion of ln(1 + t) around t=0, which is t - t^2/2 + t^3/3 - ... So, ln(1 + t) ≈ t - t^2/2 + ... Then t / ln(1 + t) ≈ t / (t - t^2/2 + ... ) = 1 / (1 - t/2 + ... ) → 1 as t→0. But again, this uses the series expansion of ln(1 + t), which might require knowing derivatives, leading back to the same problem.\n\nAlternatively, use the squeeze theorem. If we can bound (e^h - 1)/h between two expressions that both approach 1. For example, using inequalities for exponential functions. We know that for h > 0, 1 + h ≤ e^h ≤ 1 + h + h^2 (for small h). Wait, maybe more precise inequalities. For h > 0, 1 + h ≤ e^h ≤ 1 + h + h^2. Then subtract 1: h ≤ e^h -1 ≤ h + h^2. Divide by h: 1 ≤ (e^h -1)/h ≤1 + h. Taking the limit as h→0+, by squeeze theorem, the limit is 1. Similarly, for h <0, maybe similar inequalities. For example, when h <0, let h = -k where k>0. Then e^{-k} -1 = -k + k^2/2! - k^3/3! + ... So, (e^{-k} -1)/(-k) = ( -k + k^2/2 - ... )/(-k) = 1 - k/2 + ... So, approaching 1 as k→0. So, combining both sides, the two-sided limit is 1. Therefore, using inequalities and squeeze theorem, we can prove the limit without L’Hospital’s.\n\nBut how to get those inequalities? Maybe using the definition of e^h as the sum of the series. If we take e^h = 1 + h + h^2/2! + h^3/3! + ..., then e^h -1 = h + h^2/2! + ... So, (e^h -1)/h = 1 + h/2! + h^2/3! + ... which is 1 plus terms that go to 0 as h→0. Therefore, the limit is 1. But again, this requires knowing the series expansion, which may or may not be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, use the definition of e as the limit (1 + h)^{1/h} as h approaches 0. Wait, if we let n = 1/h, then as h→0, n→∞, and (1 + 1/n)^n approaches e. But perhaps using this definition, we can relate to the limit. Let me think.\n\nIf e = lim_{h→0} (1 + h)^{1/h}, then take natural logarithm: ln e = 1 = lim_{h→0} (1/h) * ln(1 + h). Wait, but that gives lim_{h→0} (ln(1 + h))/h =1. Which is the reciprocal of the limit we want. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, let me write that again. Let’s suppose that e = lim_{h→0} (1 + h)^{1/h}. Taking natural logs on both sides: 1 = lim_{h→0} (1/h) * ln(1 + h). So, lim_{h→0} (ln(1 + h))/h =1. But in our original problem, we have lim_{h→0} (e^h -1)/h. So, if we let t = e^h -1, then as h→0, t→0. And h = ln(1 + t). Then the original limit becomes lim_{t→0} t / ln(1 + t) = 1. But we just saw that lim_{h→0} ln(1 + h)/h =1, so the reciprocal is also 1. Therefore, lim_{t→0} t / ln(1 + t) =1. Therefore, the original limit is 1. So, by substitution, we can prove it. But does this approach rely on knowing that the limit of ln(1 + h)/h is 1? If that's established independently, then yes. But how to establish that limit without using L’Hospital’s?\n\nAlternatively, using the definition of the derivative of ln(1 + h) at h=0. The derivative of ln(1 + h) at h=0 is 1/(1 + 0) =1. So, the limit as h→0 of [ln(1 + h) - ln(1)]/h =1. Therefore, lim_{h→0} ln(1 + h)/h =1. Therefore, using the derivative of ln at 1, which might require knowing the derivative of ln, but if we can accept that derivative, then it works. But if we are in the process of finding derivatives, this might be circular. Because to find the derivative of ln(1 + h), we might need to know some other limits.\n\nAlternatively, use the integral definition of ln(1 + h) as the integral from 1 to 1+h of 1/t dt. Then, [ln(1 + h)]/h = (1/h) * ∫_{1}^{1+h} 1/t dt. The integral can be approximated by the rectangle with height 1/(1 + θh) for some θ between 0 and 1. So, by the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, there exists c between 1 and 1+h such that ∫_{1}^{1+h} 1/t dt = h * 1/c. Therefore, [ln(1 + h)]/h = 1/c. As h→0, c approaches 1, so 1/c approaches 1. Therefore, the limit is 1. Therefore, lim_{h→0} ln(1 + h)/h =1. Then, as before, using substitution t = e^h -1, we get lim_{t→0} t / ln(1 + t) =1. Therefore, the original limit is 1. This approach uses the integral definition and the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, which might be acceptable without invoking derivatives.\n\nSo, putting it all together: To prove that lim_{x→0} (e^x -1)/x =1 without L’Hospital’s, one can use substitution and the known limit of ln(1 + h)/h as h→0, which can be established via integrals or the definition of the derivative of ln(x) at x=1. Alternatively, use the series expansion if acceptable, or use inequalities and the squeeze theorem.\n\nIn the problem statement, the user wants to structure the problem by listing assumptions and then the problem. The original question mentions that they are working with the derivative definition and trying to avoid circular reasoning (using L’Hospital’s). So the key assumptions here are about the definitions and properties of e^x that can be used. For example, if we assume the definition of e^x as its power series, or as the solution to y’=y, or as the limit of (1 + x/n)^n. Each of these could be different assumptions. However, in the original problem, the user didn't specify any particular definition, so we need to list the minimal assumptions needed.\n\nBut the example given in the original instruction for the format was:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that...\n\nSo in this case, perhaps the assumptions are about the variable approaching 0, the function e^x being defined in a certain way, etc. But the original problem here is to find the limit, so the assumptions would be about the function e^x and the limit. However, the user didn't state any specific conditions except that x approaches 0. So perhaps the only assumption is that x is a real number approaching 0, but since that's part of the limit, maybe there are no additional assumptions. Wait, the example had assumptions on n (integer, divisible by 7). So in the current problem, if there are implicit assumptions, they need to be listed. But the original problem is just to prove the limit, so maybe the only assumption is that x is approaching 0. But maybe the problem assumes that e^x is defined in a certain way, but the user hasn't specified. Since the problem is presented in the context of trying to compute the derivative of e^x using the limit definition, the key assumption would be that we are using the definition of e^x without already knowing its derivative. Therefore, to avoid circularity, we need to use a definition of e^x that doesn't rely on its derivative. For example, e^x could be defined as the sum of its Taylor series, or as the limit of (1 + x/n)^n, or as the inverse of the natural logarithm, where ln is defined as an integral. Depending on which definition is used, the assumptions would vary. However, in the absence of specific information, maybe the problem assumes that we can use basic properties of e^x, but not its derivative. Therefore, the assumption would be that we know e^x is continuous and satisfies certain properties, but not its derivative. However, since the example in the original instruction listed specific assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), but in this problem, the original problem doesn't state any specific conditions on x except that it approaches 0. Therefore, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the variable approaching 0. But maybe to list the assumption that x is a real number, and that the limit is as x approaches 0. However, since these are part of the problem statement, maybe they don't need to be listed as separate assumptions. The example given had assumptions beyond the problem's initial statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but actually, the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption was \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect, because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should not add that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake in the example. But the user provided that as their example. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example, but regardless, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions. Perhaps in the example, they considered that to prove divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13), they needed to show divisibility by both 7 and 13. So the assumption might be that n is an integer, and then the problem is to show divisibility by 91. But in the formatted problem, they mistakenly added that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, confusing. But perhaps the key point is to list all assumptions given in the problem. So in the current problem about the limit, the original problem is to prove that the limit is 1, with the context of trying to find the derivative of e^x. So the assumptions would be related to the definition of e^x being used. Since the user wants to avoid circular reasoning (not using L’Hospital’s because they're computing the derivative), the assumption would be that we are using a definition of e^x that doesn't require knowing its derivative. For example:\n\nAssumption:\ne^x is defined as the function satisfying d/dx e^x = e^x and e^0 = 1.\nBut wait, that definition already includes the derivative, which would be circular. So another assumption would be that e^x is defined via its Taylor series, or as the limit of (1 + x/n)^n, or as the inverse of the natural logarithm. So depending on which definition is chosen, the assumptions would be different.\n\nBut since the problem as stated doesn't specify the definition, perhaps the correct approach is to list the minimal assumptions necessary. However, given the example provided by the user, where assumptions were listed even if they weren't in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), maybe in this case, the assistant is supposed to extract assumptions from the problem. But looking at the original question here: \"Proving that lim_{x→0} (e^x -1)/x =1\". The user mentions they derived up to e^x times the limit, and want to compute that limit without L’Hospital’s. So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. The limit is as x approaches 0.\n2. e^x is defined such that its derivative is being computed from scratch, without prior knowledge of its derivative.\n\nBut perhaps in terms of the problem structure, the assumptions would be the properties of e^x that can be used. For example, if we are allowed to use the Taylor series expansion of e^x, that's an assumption. Or, if we can use the definition of e as lim_{n→∞} (1 + 1/n)^n, and e^x = lim_{n→∞} (1 + x/n)^n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require additional assumptions beyond the basic limit properties. So, according to the example, the assistant might list:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe limit is taken as x approaches 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 0}\\frac{e^x-1}{x} = 1$\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to list implicit assumptions. But that seems incorrect. Maybe the example was flawed. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, the only assumption is that x approaches 0, but since that's part of the limit expression, maybe no additional assumptions are needed. However, the example included an assumption that n is an integer, which was stated in the original problem. So in the current problem, if the original problem says \"for x approaching 0\", then the assumption is x approaches 0. But in the example, they listed n is an integer, which was in the original problem. So following that, here the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx approaches 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 0}\\frac{e^x-1}{x} = 1$.\n\nBut maybe more precise. Alternatively, since the problem is in the context of computing the derivative of e^x, maybe the assumption is that the derivative of e^x at 0 is being considered. But not sure. Given the example had redundant assumptions, perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The limit is considered as x approaches 0.\n\nBut since these are part of the problem statement, maybe they don't need to be listed. The example's original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\", which was redundant. So perhaps in this problem, similar redundancy is expected. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx approaches 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 0}\\frac{e^x-1}{x} = 1$.\n\nBut the user’s example included an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which was incorrect. So perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem, even if they are part of the problem statement. Therefore, in this case, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem is about the limit as x approaches 0, so:\n\nAssumption:\nThe limit is taken as x approaches 0,\nThe function e^x is defined and continuous.\n\nBut the continuity might be an assumption. Alternatively, since e^x is a standard function, maybe no need. It's a bit ambiguous. But following the example's approach, where they listed \"n is an integer\" even though it was stated in the problem, here we can list:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe limit is evaluated as x approaches 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 0}\\frac{e^x-1}{x} = 1$.\n\nThat should suffice. The key is to parse the original problem and list any assumptions, even if they are explicitly stated in the problem. The example had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\". So similarly, here the problem states the limit as x→0, so the assumptions are x approaches 0. But since x is a variable, maybe we need to state it's a real variable. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx approaches 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 0}\\frac{e^x-1}{x} = 1$.\n\nThis follows the example's structure, even if the assumptions are part of the problem statement.",
