    "Content": "Let $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ continuous such that $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x+1)-f(x)=l$. How can I prove that $\\dfrac{f(x)}x$ converges for $x\\to+\\infty$ ? I am just trying to prove the convergence, not that it converges to $l$ (that part be deduced immediately by Stolz-Cesaro and the sequential characterization of limits)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a similar but more interesting statement. Let $f$ defined on $(a,+\\infty)$ and bounded on all bounded interval $(a,b)$ . If $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\bigr(f(x+1)-f(x)\\bigl)=l$ then $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{x}=l$ as well. Let $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\bigr(f(x+1)-f(x)\\bigl)=l$ and introduce $M_n=\\sup_{[n,n+1)} f(x)$ and $m_n=\\inf_{[n,n+1)} f(x)$ . The sequences $\\{M_n\\}$ and $\\{m_n\\}$ are well defined for $n\\ge \\lfloor a\\rfloor +1$ . By definition of $\\sup$ and $\\inf$ we have have a sequence $\\{x_n\\}\\in[n,n+1)$ sand $f(x_n)>M_n-\\varepsilon$ . Now conclude that $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow +\\infty} (M_{n+1}-M_n)=l$ and $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow +\\infty} (m_{n+1}-m_n)=l$ as well. By Stolz-Cesaro theorem $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{M_n}{n}=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{m_n}{n+1}.$$ Then there exist $n_0$ such that $n>n_0$ we have $$-\\varepsilon<\\frac{M_n}{n}-l<\\varepsilon\\quad\\text{and}\\quad -\\varepsilon<\\frac{m_n}{n+1}-l<\\varepsilon.$$ It follows that $f(x)>0$ for $x$ large enough if $l>0$ . Then if $n_x=\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ then $$\n\\frac{m_{n_x}}{n_x+1}\\le\\frac{f(x)}{x}\\le\\frac{M_{n_x}}{n_x}\n.$$ It's pretty easy to conclude for $l\\ne 0$ . I leave the rest of the job to you for $l=0$ and for $l<0$ the preceding inequality becomes $$\n\\frac{m_{n_x}}{n_x}\\le\\frac{f(x)}{x}\\le\\frac{M_{n_x}}{n_x+1}\n.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that if a continuous function f has the property that the difference f(x+1) - f(x) approaches a limit l as x goes to infinity, then f(x)/x also converges as x approaches infinity.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The example given in the problem had assumptions each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Let me go through the original question again.\n\nThe function f is defined from R to R, and it's continuous. Then, the limit of f(x+1) - f(x) as x approaches infinity is l. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f: R → R is continuous. (This is one property about f, continuity.)\n2. The limit as x approaches infinity of [f(x+1) - f(x)] is l. (This is another condition on f's behavior.)\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions f is continuous. So that's the first assumption. The second assumption is about the limit of the difference f(x+1) - f(x) being l as x approaches infinity.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that f(x)/x converges as x approaches infinity. So the problem statement is that.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. So in this case, two assumptions: f is continuous, and the limit of f(x+1)-f(x) is l as x approaches infinity.\n\nBut the user didn't mention any other conditions. So that's it. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: Let f: R→R continuous such that lim_{x→∞} f(x+1) - f(x) = l. Prove that f(x)/x converges as x→∞.\n\nSo yes, two assumptions: continuity of f, and the limit of the difference. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nf: R → R is continuous,\nThe limit as x approaches infinity of [f(x+1) - f(x)] is l.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x)/x converges as x approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were written in bullet points, each line as a separate assumption. So here, each line is one assumption. The first is about the continuity of f, the second is about the limit of the difference. So that's correct. The problem is to prove convergence of f(x)/x.\n\nI think that's it. There are no other hidden assumptions. The problem is correctly structured with these two assumptions. So I can present it in the required format now.",
