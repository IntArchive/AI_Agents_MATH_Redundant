    "Content": "I'm trying to prove (or disprove) that every linear ordered set $(X, <_X)$ is normal in its order topology. I was able to prove $(X,<_X)$ is hausdorff, simply by taking two open intervals with $\\pm\\infty $ for every $x,y\\in X$ with no common points, but when it comes to proving $(X,<_X)$ is normal, I'm  not sure on how to prove it. Taking two closed sets $A,B\\subseteq X$, I'd like to find two open sets $\\hat A, \\hat B$  such that: $A\\subseteq \\hat A$ $B \\subseteq \\hat B$ $\\hat A \\cap \\hat B = \\emptyset $ I thought to somehow divide $A$ and $B$ to sub-sets, such that: $A_1$ consists of elements of $A$ that have a successor and a predecessor $A_2$ consists of elements of $A$ that have a successor and dont have a predecessor $A_3$ consists of elements of $A$ that dont have a successor and have a predecessor (this case is symmetric to case $2$) $A_4$ consists of elements of $A$ that dont have either a successor nor a predecessor And same for $B$. Then I know all elements of $A_1$ and $B_1$ are open sets (every singleton $\\{x \\}$ where $x\\in A_1$), and for $A_2$ and $A_3$ I think I can find open sets that will still have no common elements with $B$, but didn't write it formally yet (still in my head), so not sure I'll actually be able to do so. But asides form that, what bothers me is $A_4$, which I have no idea how to handle. Does anyone have an idea on how to handle $A_4$, or a formalization of the way of handling $A_2$ and $A_3$, or perhaps - a shorter/more understandable proof (or disproof) for $(X,<_X)$ being normal?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Don't try to disprove it, because the theorem is true! (The proof uses the axiom of choice, but that's O.K. because the axiom of choice is true.) Here is a proof I found in my notes. It proves that a linearly ordered topological space is not only normal but completely (or hereditarily ) normal, i.e., if $A,B$ are sets (not necessarily closed) such that $A\\cap\\bar B=B\\cap\\bar A=\\emptyset$ , then there are disjoint open sets $U,V$ such that $A\\subseteq U$ and $B\\subseteq V$ . Without loss of generality, we assume that no point of $A\\cup B$ is an endpoint of $X$ . For each $a\\in A$ , choose $p_a,q_a\\in X$ satisfying the conditions: $p_a\\lt a\\lt q_a$ ; $(p_a,q_a)\\cap B=\\emptyset$ ; $(a,q_a)=\\emptyset$ or $q_a\\in A$ or $q_a\\notin B\\wedge(a,q_a)\\cap A=\\emptyset$ ; $(p_a,a)=\\emptyset$ or $p_a\\in A$ or $p_a\\notin B\\wedge(p_a,a)\\cap A=\\emptyset$ . You can verify [*] that such points $p_a,q_a$ exist for each $a\\in A$ . Now it is clear that the set $$U=\\bigcup_{a\\in A}(p_a,q_a)$$ is an open set containing $A$ , and that $V=X\\setminus\\bar U$ is an open set disjoint from $U$ . Now you have to prove that $B\\subseteq V$ . [*] Consider any $a\\in A$ ; we want $q_a\\gt a$ with $(a,q_a)\\cap B=\\emptyset$ and satisfying condition 3. First choose $q\\gt a$ with $(a,q)\\cap B=\\emptyset$ . Now we consider three cases. Case I. If $(a,q)=\\emptyset$ , let $q_a=q$ . Case II. If $(a,q)\\cap A\\ne\\emptyset$ , choose $q_a\\in(a,q)\\cap A$ . Case III. If $(a,q)\\ne\\emptyset=(a,q)\\cap A$ , choose $q_a\\in(a,q)$ . P.S. I've been asked to explain why $B\\subseteq V$ . Consider a point $b\\in B$ ; I have to show that $b\\in V$ , i.e., that $b\\notin\\overline U$ . In other words, I have to find $c,d\\in X$ such that $c\\lt b\\lt d$ and $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(c,d)=\\emptyset$ for all $a\\in A$ . Let $A'=\\{a\\in A:a\\lt b\\}$ and $A''=\\{a\\in A:a\\gt b\\}$ . I have to show that (i) there is $c\\lt b$ such that $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(c,b)=\\emptyset$ for all $a\\in A'$ , and (ii) there is $d\\gt b$ such that $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(b,d)=\\emptyset$ for all $a\\in A''$ . By symmetry, it will suffice to prove (i). Since $b\\notin\\overline A$ , there are $c_0,d_0\\in X$ such that $c_0\\lt b\\lt d_0$ and $A\\cap(c_0,d_0)=\\emptyset$ . Now, if $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(c_0,b)=\\emptyset$ for all $a\\in A'$ , then I can take $c=c_0$ . On the other hand, if there is just one $a\\in A'$ with $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(c_0,b)\\ne\\emptyset$ , and if $q_a\\lt b$ for that $a$ , then I can take $c=q_a$ . I will show that no other case can arise. Consider any $a\\in A'$ ; we have $a\\le c_0$ since $a\\lt b$ and $A\\cap(c_0,d_0)=\\emptyset$ , and we have $q_a\\le b$ since $b\\notin(p_a,q_a)$ . Consider the three alternatives in Condition 3. First, if $(a,q_a)=\\emptyset$ , then $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(c_0,b)=(p_a,a]\\cap(c_0,b)=\\emptyset$ . Second, if $q_a\\in A$ , then $q_a\\le c_0$ and so $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(c_0,b)=\\emptyset$ . Therefore, if $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(c_0,b)\\ne\\emptyset$ , then we must have $q_a\\notin B$ and $(a,q_a)\\cap A=\\emptyset$ . Since $q_a\\le b$ and $q_a\\notin B$ , we have $q_a\\lt b$ as desired. Finally, assume for a contradiction that there are two different points $a,a_1\\in A'$ such that $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(c_0,b)\\ne\\emptyset$ and $(p_{a_1},q_{a_1})\\cap(c_0,b)\\ne\\emptyset$ ; without loss of generality, we may assume $a\\lt a_1$ . Then $a_1\\ge q_a$ since $(a,q_a)\\cap A=\\emptyset$ , and $a_1\\le c_0$ since $A\\cap(c_0,d_0)=\\emptyset$ . Thus $q_a\\le a_1\\le c_0$ ; but then $(p_a,q_a)\\cap(c_0,b)=\\emptyset$ , a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking whether every linearly ordered set (with its order topology) is normal. They mentioned they've already proven it's Hausdorff but are stuck on normality. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions involved. A normal space is one where any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods. The order topology on a linearly ordered set has a basis consisting of open intervals and rays. Now, in the example given, the user tried splitting the closed sets A and B into subsets based on the existence of successors and predecessors. They're concerned about elements in A₄, which have neither a successor nor a predecessor.\n\nI remember that in some ordered spaces, like the real line (which is normal), this approach works because the space is also Lindelöf and hence normal. But not all linearly ordered spaces are Lindelöf. For example, the Sorgenfrey line (the real line with the lower limit topology) is Lindelöf and normal, but that's a different topology. Wait, the Sorgenfrey line isn't an order topology, though. Maybe the long line is a better example? The long line is a linearly ordered space that's not normal. Wait, is that true? Wait, the long line is a manifold, and it's normal because it's locally metrizable. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, there's the example of the Tychonoff plank, which is a compact Hausdorff space but not normal. But no, that's a product space. Wait, perhaps the problem is that not every linearly ordered space is normal. The user is asking for a proof or disproof. So maybe there's a counterexample.\n\nWait, I think the standard result is that every linearly ordered topological space is normal. But I need to verify that. Let me check my memory. In Munkres' Topology, he mentions that every well-ordered set is normal, but I'm not sure about general linearly ordered sets. Wait, no, the order topology on a linearly ordered set is actually normal. The proof might involve using the fact that in a linearly ordered set, for two disjoint closed sets, you can separate them using intervals based on their order.\n\nAlternatively, the user's approach of dividing into subsets with successors/predecessors might be complicating things. Maybe there's a standard way to separate closed sets in a linear order. For example, if A and B are disjoint closed sets, then for each point a in A, since B is closed and a is not in B, there's an interval around a that doesn't intersect B. Similarly for points in B. But that's just Hausdorffness again. Normality requires handling entire closed sets, not just points.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that in a linearly ordered space, it's hereditarily normal (completely normal). Or maybe not. Let me think of a specific example. The Sorgenfrey line is not an order topology, so that's out. What about the Michael line? That's another example of a non-normal space, but again, not an order topology. Maybe the ordinal space [0, ω₁) is normal. Yes, it is, because it's countably compact and Hausdorff, hence normal. But what about [0, ω₁] × [0, ω₁] with the lex order? That's a linearly ordered space, right? Wait, no, the lex order on the square is a linear order, but the space is not normal. Wait, is that true? The lex-ordered square is compact Hausdorff, hence normal. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is the \"Sorgenfrey arrow,\" which is the set [0,1) with the order topology induced by the lex order on [0,1) × {0,1}, but that's actually homeomorphic to the Sorgenfrey line, which isn't an order topology. So maybe there isn't a standard example of a linearly ordered space that's not normal. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that yes, every linearly ordered space is normal. Let me recall a theorem. Yes, in fact, in Engelking's \"General Topology,\" Theorem 5.1.3 states that every linearly ordered space is hereditarily normal (i.e., completely normal). So the answer should be yes, every linearly ordered set is normal in its order topology.\n\nBut then why is the user struggling with the A₄ case? Maybe their approach is not the standard one. The standard proof would use a different method. For example, given two disjoint closed sets A and B in X, for each a in A, since B is closed and a not in B, there exists an interval around a that doesn't intersect B, and vice versa. Then use these intervals to construct the separating open sets. But perhaps the standard proof uses the fact that in a linearly ordered space, disjoint closed sets can be separated by convex open sets. Alternatively, using Urysohn's lemma? But Urysohn requires normality to begin with.\n\nWait, no. Urysohn's lemma says that normality is equivalent to the existence of a continuous function separating two closed sets. So if we can prove normality without Urysohn, we can then apply Urysohn's lemma. But the user wants to prove normality.\n\nAlternatively, the standard approach is to use a \"linear order\" to construct the open sets explicitly. For each a in A and b in B, since a ≠ b and X is linearly ordered, without loss of generality assume a < b. Then, since A and B are closed, there exists a point between a and b that's not in B, and similarly not in A. Then, build open intervals around each a and b that don't intersect the other set. Then take the union for A and B. But ensuring that these unions are disjoint is tricky. Maybe this is where the user's partitioning into A₁, A₂, etc., comes in.\n\nAlternatively, the standard proof might involve the following steps: in a linearly ordered space, the order topology is monotonically normal, which is stronger than being hereditarily normal. Monotonic normality means that there's a function assigning to each point x and a closed set C not containing x, an open neighborhood such that these neighborhoods are ordered in a way compatible with the linear order. This might be overkill, though.\n\nAlternatively, the key idea is to use the fact that in a linearly ordered space, any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by convex open sets. For example, for each a in A, find an open interval around a that doesn't intersect B, and similarly for B. Then the union of these intervals for A and B may form the required open sets. However, the problem is ensuring that these unions are disjoint. To handle this, we might need to carefully choose the intervals so that they don't overlap. For instance, if A and B are separated in the order, we can pick a point between them and split the space there. But if A and B are intertwined, it's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard proof uses the fact that linearly ordered spaces are collectionwise normal. But I'm not sure. Let me try to recall or reconstruct the proof.\n\nSuppose A and B are disjoint closed subsets of X. For each a in A, since B is closed and a not in B, there exists an open interval around a that does not intersect B. Similarly, for each b in B, there exists an open interval around b that does not intersect A. The challenge is to adjust these intervals so that their unions for A and B are disjoint.\n\nOne approach is to use the linear order to assign to each a in A an open interval (x_a, y_a) where x_a < a < y_a, such that (x_a, y_a) ∩ B = ∅. Similarly, for each b in B, assign (p_b, q_b) with p_b < b < q_b and (p_b, q_b) ∩ A = ∅. Now, define U = ∪_{a ∈ A} (x_a, y_a) and V = ∪_{b ∈ B} (p_b, q_b). We need to ensure U and V are disjoint.\n\nBut if there is overlap between any (x_a, y_a) and (p_b, q_b), then that would be a problem. To prevent this, maybe we can refine the intervals. For instance, for each a in A, choose x_a and y_a such that y_a is less than the infimum of B if a is below B, or x_a is greater than the supremum of B if a is above B. But this requires that B is bounded above or below relative to A, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in a linear order, the topology is generated by intervals, and we can use the linear order to \"interleave\" the open sets. For example, for each a in A, if there's a point between a and B, we can use that point to define the right endpoint of the interval around a. Similarly for b in B. This might ensure that intervals from A and B don't overlap.\n\nAnother method is to use the \"shrinking\" lemma, where in a normal space, locally finite open covers can be shrunk, but I think that's circular here.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach: Define U as the union of all open intervals around points in A that are disjoint from B, and V similarly. If these aren't disjoint, then there's some overlap between an interval around a in A and an interval around b in B. But if a and b are such that a < b, and their intervals overlap, then there's a point between a and b that is in both intervals, which would imply that this point is not in B (since the interval around a doesn't intersect B) and not in A (since the interval around b doesn't intersect A). But since A and B are closed, and the point is between a and b, perhaps this leads to a contradiction, or allows us to adjust the intervals.\n\nAlternatively, the standard proof might use the fact that in a linear order, any two closed sets can be separated by a point, and then use that point to define a separation. For instance, if A and B are disjoint closed sets, then for each a in A and b in B with a < b, there exists a point c between a and b such that c is not in A ∪ B. Then, collect all such points c and use them to partition the space into intervals that contain A and B respectively.\n\nBut I need to formalize this. Suppose we define S as the set of all points x in X such that (-∞, x) is disjoint from B or (x, ∞) is disjoint from A. Then, S would be a set of points that can separate A and B. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method from Engelking's proof: For each a in A, let U_a = {x ∈ X | x < a and (x, a) ∩ B = ∅} and V_a = {x ∈ X | x > a and (a, x) ∩ B = ∅}. Then define intervals around a that stay within U_a and V_a. Similarly for B. But this might be too vague.\n\nWait, I think the actual proof uses a technique where for each point a in A, you can take the immediate predecessor and successor in B, but since the order is linear, you can find points that separate A and B. However, in a general linear order, elements might not have immediate successors or predecessors, which is the user's concern with A₄.\n\nBut maybe instead of trying to handle each element individually, use the fact that the space is order-convex. For example, consider the set of all points x where (-∞, x] is disjoint from B. The supremum of this set could be a point separating A and B. Similarly, take the infimum of points where [x, ∞) is disjoint from A. If these points can be used to create a gap between A and B, then you can separate them with intervals.\n\nAlternatively, here's a precise approach: Let A and B be disjoint closed sets. For each a in A, since B is closed and a not in B, there exists an open interval around a not intersecting B. Similarly for B. Let’s construct these intervals such that for each a in A, choose an interval (c_a, d_a) where c_a < a < d_a and (c_a, d_a) ∩ B = ∅. Similarly, for each b in B, choose (p_b, q_b) with p_b < b < q_b and (p_b, q_b) ∩ A = ∅. Now, take U = ∪_{a ∈ A} (c_a, d_a) and V = ∪_{b ∈ B} (p_b, q_b). If U and V are disjoint, we are done. If not, there exists some x in U ∩ V. Then x is in some (c_a, d_a) and some (p_b, q_b). Since x is in both intervals, we have c_a < x < d_a and p_b < x < q_b. Without loss of generality, assume a < b. Then since a is in A and b is in B, which are disjoint, a ≠ b. If a < b, then since x is between a and b, but (c_a, d_a) doesn't intersect B, so b cannot be in (c_a, d_a), which would mean d_a ≤ b. Similarly, since (p_b, q_b) doesn't intersect A, p_b ≥ a. But x is in both intervals, so c_a < x < d_a ≤ b and p_b ≤ a < x < q_b. Therefore, c_a < x < d_a ≤ b and a < x < q_b. But since a < x < d_a ≤ b and p_b ≤ a, then p_b ≤ a < x < d_a ≤ b < q_b. But this implies that x is in (p_b, q_b), which is supposed to not intersect A. However, x is in (c_a, d_a), which is around a in A, but x itself is not in A because A and B are disjoint. Wait, x could be in neither A nor B. But then x is in U ∩ V, but not in A or B. However, U is supposed to cover A and V covers B, but U and V can overlap in points not in A or B. This doesn't necessarily violate the disjointness of the open sets, but we need U and V to be disjoint. So perhaps this approach doesn't work because the overlaps can occur in the \"middle\" regions.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps we need a more refined construction. Here's a standard method: Define U as the union over all a in A of the intervals (c_a, d_a) where d_a is chosen such that (c_a, d_a) ∩ B = ∅. Similarly, define V as the union over all b in B of (p_b, q_b) with (p_b, q_b) ∩ A = ∅. Now, to ensure U and V are disjoint, we need to choose these intervals such that for any a ∈ A and b ∈ B, (c_a, d_a) and (p_b, q_b) are disjoint. If a < b, then we can ensure that d_a ≤ p_b, so their intervals don't overlap. Similarly, if b < a, then q_b ≤ c_a. To do this, for each a in A, set d_a = inf { b ∈ B | b > a }, and for each b in B, set p_b = sup { a ∈ A | a < b }. Then, define U as the union of (c_a, d_a) for a in A, and V as the union of (p_b, q_b) for b in B. However, this requires that these infima and suprema exist, which they do in a linear order if we allow ±∞. But if A and B are \"interleaved,\" like A = {1, 3, 5, ...} and B = {2, 4, 6, ...} in the integers, then this method would work by choosing intervals between the elements.\n\nBut in general, for arbitrary linear orders, this might not be possible. For example, consider X as the real line, A = [0,1], B = [2,3]. Then, U could be (0-ε,1+ε) and V similarly, but if they don't overlap, it's fine. If A and B are interleaved like A = [0,1] ∪ [2,3] and B = [1.5, 2.5], then it's more complicated. But in such cases, the standard proof would still work by constructing the open sets appropriately.\n\nAnother angle: In a linearly ordered space, the order topology is hereditarily normal, which implies normal. The hereditary normality comes from the fact that any subspace inherits the linear order, and thus is also normal. Therefore, the original space must be normal.\n\nBut how to actually construct the open sets? Maybe use a proof similar to the proof that metric spaces are normal. In metric spaces, for disjoint closed sets A and B, you can define U = {x | d(x,A) < d(x,B)} and V = {x | d(x,B) < d(x,A)}, which are disjoint open sets. In a linearly ordered space, maybe define a function based on the order that separates A and B.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in a linear order, every closed set is a Gδ set (countable intersection of open sets), but I'm not sure if that's true.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by Urysohn's lemma but without assuming normality. For each point a in A, find an open interval around a that doesn't intersect B, and vice versa. Then, use the linear order to \"index\" these intervals and ensure they don't overlap. For instance, for each a in A, let’s find the nearest point in B above and below a, if they exist, and define intervals around a that avoid B. If there's no such point in B above a, then extend the interval to infinity, and similarly below.\n\nBut this requires that B is \"order-separated\" from A, which might not be straightforward. However, since A and B are closed and disjoint, for each a in A, there exists an interval around a that doesn't meet B, and vice versa. The key is to adjust these intervals so that they don't overlap between A and B.\n\nAnother idea: Since X is linearly ordered, it's a chain, and we can use the order to define a separation. For example, for each a in A, let’s define the immediate successor of a in B, but since the order is dense, this might not exist. Alternatively, use the fact that between any two points, there's a point not in A or B, since A and B are closed and disjoint.\n\nWait, let's think of the real line. If A and B are disjoint closed sets, we can separate them by open sets. The standard way is to, for each a in A, take an open interval around a not intersecting B, and similarly for B, then take the union. But as we saw earlier, these unions might overlap. However, in the real line, we can use the function f(x) = d(x,A)/(d(x,A) + d(x,B)) to separate them, which is continuous, showing the space is normal. But this uses the metric. In a general linearly ordered space, there's no metric, but maybe we can use the order to create a similar function.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in a linearly ordered space, the topology is generated by open intervals, and use transfinite induction to build the open sets. But that's complicated.\n\nWait, here's a standard theorem: Every linearly ordered topological space is hereditarily collectionwise normal. Therefore, it's normal. But I need to recall the proof.\n\nAlternatively, refer to the fact that every order topology is monotonically normal, which implies it's hereditarily normal. Monotonic normality is a stronger property where there's a monotonic assignment of open neighborhoods to points and closed sets, which preserves order. In a linearly ordered space, this can be done by, for each point x and closed set C not containing x, choosing an interval around x that's on the appropriate side relative to C, maintaining the order.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. The answer is that every linearly ordered set is normal in its order topology. The user's difficulty with A₄ might be because they're approaching it case by case, but there's a more straightforward proof using the linear order structure to separate the closed sets.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement after filtering would be:",
