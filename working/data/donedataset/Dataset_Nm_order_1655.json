    "AcceptedAnswer": "One implication is trivial. If a function is continuous, then it is measurable. The converse is more tricky. You can find a very nice proof in the following document . Another proof can be found considering the function $F(x)=\\int_0^x f(t)dt$, which is well defined since $F$ is measurable. Another approach is the following: prove that a discontinuous solution for the functional equation is not bounded on any open interval. It can be shown that for a discontinuous solution the image of any interval is dense in $\\Bbb{R}$, and therefore we have problems with the measurability.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and filter out the unnecessary information. The problem is about showing that a function f satisfying Cauchy's functional equation (f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)) is continuous if and only if it is measurable. \n\nStarting with the assumptions. The user wants each assumption to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, the main objects here are the function f and its domain/codomain. \n\nFirst assumption: The function f maps from the real numbers to the real numbers, so f: R → R. That's one condition. \n\nNext, the functional equation: For every x and y in R, f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y). This is Cauchy's equation. So that's another assumption. \n\nThen, the problem mentions two conditions: f being measurable and f being continuous. The problem is to show that these two are equivalent under the given assumptions. However, the original problem states that we need to show f is continuous if and only if f is measurable. So the two directions are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. \n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Here, do I need to list the conditions of measurability and continuity as assumptions? No, because the problem is to show the equivalence between them. So the assumptions are the function's type (from R to R), satisfying Cauchy's equation. The problem is to show that measurability implies continuity and vice versa. \n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"f measurable ⇨ f continuous\". Wait, no, the title says \"implies f continuous ⇔ f measurable\". Wait, the problem is written as \"Show that f measurable ⇔ f continuous.\" So the problem is an equivalence. So the user needs to prove both directions. \n\nBut the assumptions are the function's domain and the additive property. So in the assumption section, we list:\n\n- f: R → R (the function's domain and codomain)\n- For all x, y ∈ R, f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) (the functional equation)\n\nThen, the problem is to show that f is continuous if and only if f is measurable. \n\nSo the problem part is \"Show that f is continuous if and only if f is measurable.\"\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention anything else. The title is \"Show that f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y) implies f continuous ⇔ f measurable.\" So the main assumptions are the function is additive (Cauchy's equation) and it's from R to R. The problem is the equivalence between continuity and measurability. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from ℝ to ℝ,\nFor all x, y ∈ ℝ, f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y).\n\nProblem:\nShow that f is continuous if and only if f is measurable.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is one line per condition. The first line is about the function's type, the second is the functional equation. Both are separate, each applies to the function f. That should be correct.",
