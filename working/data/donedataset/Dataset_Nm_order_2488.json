    "Content": "This is inspired from here . I will repeat some information from the linked question for the benefit of readers. Let $k\\in(0,1)$ and the elliptic integrals $K, E$ are defined as follows: $$K(k)=\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 - k^{2}\\sin^{2}x}},\\,E(k)=\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\sqrt{1-k^{2}\\sin^{2}x}\\,dx\\tag{1}$$ The number $k$ is called the modulus and a complementary modulus $k'$ is defined by $k'=\\sqrt{1-k^{2}}$ and if the value of $k$ is available from context then the integrals $K(k), E(k), K(k'), E(k') $ are generally denoted by $K, E, K', E'$. If $n$ is a positive rational number then it can be proved that there is a unique modulus $k$ such that $K'/K=\\sqrt{n} $ and moreover this $k$ is an algebraic number. Such values of $k$ are famous and are called singular moduli and one may denote them by $k_{n} $ corresponding to the rational number $n$. Chowla and Selberg proved in this paper that Theorem : Let $k$ be a singular modulus. Then the elliptic integrals $K(k), E(k) $ can be expressed in terms of Gamma values at rational points and $\\pi$. The linked paper of Chowla and Selberg uses theory of quadratic forms and related complex analytic techniques to prove their theorem. On the other hand Ramanujan knew the evaluation of $K$ in terms of Gamma values and $\\pi$ for some singular moduli $k$. In his classic paper Modular Equations and Approximations to $\\pi$ he gave the evaluations for $n=1,2,3$ without proof. It is thus reasonable to assume that the evaluations are possible by remaining within the limits of real analysis methods at least for $n=1,2,3$. The case $n=1$ is covered in this answer . My question  concerns the cases $n=2,3$ for which $k=\\tan(\\pi/8),\\sin(\\pi/12)$ respectively: Show that $$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-\\tan^{2}(\\pi/8)\\sin^{2}x}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2} +1} \\Gamma (1/8)\\Gamma (3/8)}{2^{13/4}\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\tag{2}$$ and $$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2}(\\pi/12)\\sin^{2}x}}=\\frac{3^{1/4}\\Gamma ^{3}(1/3)}{2^{7/3}\\pi}\\tag{3}$$ Evaluation based on real analysis methods is desirable. Update : I have managed to prove the above mentioned results using hints given in exercises from Borwein's Pi and the AGM (see my answer). But these methods are totally non-obvious and it is desirable to find solutions based on general techniques for evaluation of definite integrals. Borwein's book was with me for a long time and these exercises lay dormant until I receieved a gentle push via user \"Simply Beautiful Art\"'s question linked above. Thanks to him for the same.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I finally found a solution for $k = \\sin(\\pi/12)$. It is taken from an exercise in Borwein's Pi and the AGM . Let's start with the integral $$I(a, b) = \\int_{-a}^{a}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(a^{2} - x^{2})(b^{2} + x^{2})}}\\tag{1}$$ which is equal to $$\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}}K\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}}\\right)\\tag{2}$$ Equivalence of $I(a, b)$ with $(2)$ can be seen by writing $K$ as\n\\begin{align}\nK(k) &= \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 - k^{2}\\cos^{2}x}}\\notag\\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 - k^{2} + k^{2}\\sin^{2}x}}\\notag\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{(1 - t^{2})(1 - k^{2} + k^{2}t^{2})}}\\notag\\\\\n\\end{align}\nPutting $k = a/\\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}$ we can see that $$K\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}}\\right) = \\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{(1 - t^{2})(b^{2} + a^{2}t^{2})}}$$ and using substitution $x = at$ we  get the link between $(1)$ and $(2)$. Next we use the substitution $x = (1/t) - a$ in $(1)$ to get $$I(a, b) = \\int_{1/2a}^{\\infty}\\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{(2at - 1)((a^{2} + b^{2})t^{2} - 2at + 1)}}$$ The expression in square root can be expressed as $$2a(a^{2} + b^{2})t^{3} - (5a^{2} + b^{2})t^{2} + 4at - 1$$ and using the substitution $$t = x + \\frac{5a^{2} + b^{2}}{6a(a^{2} + b^{2})}$$ the integral is transformed into $$I(a, b) = \\int_{e}^{\\infty}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{4x^{3} - g_{2}x - g_{3}}}\\tag{3}$$ where $$g_{2} = \\frac{(a^{2} - b^{2})^{2}}{12} - a^{2}b^{2},\\, g_{3} = -\\frac{(a^{2} - b^{2})\\{(a^{2} - b^{2})^{2} + 36a^{2}b^{2}\\}}{216}\\tag{4}$$ and $e$ is the root of the cubic equation $4x^{3} - g_{2}x - g_{3} = 0$. Next step is to put $g_{2} = 0$ so that $12a^{2}b^{2} = (a^{2} - b^{2})^{2}$ which gives $$a^{2} - b^{2} = -3(2g_{3})^{1/3}, a^{2} + b^{2} = 2\\sqrt{3}(2|g_{3}|)^{1/3}\\tag{5}$$ For our case we need to set $g_{3} = 1/2$ so that the root $e = 1/2$ and then we have $$a^{2} + b^{2} = 2\\sqrt{3}, a^{2} - b^{2} = -3$$ so that $$\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\sin(\\pi/12)$$ From $(1), (2), (3)$ and above values of $a, b$ it follows that $$K(k) = \\frac{3^{1/4}}{2}\\int_{1}^{\\infty}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x^{3} - 1}}$$ And putting $x^{3} = 1/t$ we get $$K(k) = \\frac{3^{1/4}}{6}\\int_{0}^{1}t^{-5/6}(1 - t)^{-1/2}\\,dt = \\frac{3^{1/4}}{6}\\frac{\\Gamma(1/6)\\Gamma(1/2)}{\\Gamma(2/3)}$$ This can be expressed in terms of $\\Gamma(1/3)$ only (via duplication and reflection formulas) to give the desired form. I must say that the above solution is totally non-obvious and without the hints in the exercise it does not appear possible to arrive at this solution. The value of $K(\\sin(\\pi/12))$ was first obtained by Legendre using a similar non-obvious approach. Borwein's book provides the evaluation of $K(\\tan(\\pi/8))$ as an exercise in a later chapter. But this is based on the representation of $2K(k)/\\pi$ as the hypergeometric function ${}_{2}F_{1}(1/2,1/2;1;k^{2})$. To simplify typing we will use $F$ instead of ${}_{2}F_{1}$ in what follows. The following two hypergeometric transformations are needed to create the magic\n\\begin{align}\n&F(a, b; a - b + 1; x)\\notag\\\\\n&\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,= (1 - x)^{1 - 2b}(1 + x)^{2b - a - 1}F\\left(\\frac{a - 2b + 1}{2}, \\frac{a - 2b + 2}{2}; a - b + 1; \\frac{4x}{(1 + x)^{2}}\\right)\\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\nand $$F\\left(a, b; a + b + \\frac{1}{2}; 4x(1 - x)\\right) = F\\left(2a, 2b; a + b + \\frac{1}{2}; x\\right)\\tag{7}$$ Equation $(7)$ is by Kummer and proved here . Equation $(6)$ can be proved in a similar manner but with more difficulty. We start with the equation $$\\frac{2K}{\\pi} = F\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2};1;k^{2}\\right)$$ and put $a=b=1/2, x = k^{2}$ in $(6)$ to get $$\\frac{2K}{\\pi}=(1 + k^{2})^{-1/2}F\\left(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4};1;\\frac{4k^{2}}{(1 + k^{2})^{2}}\\right)$$ Using $a = 1/8, b = 3/8, x = 4k^{2}/(1 + k^{2})^{2}$ in $(7)$ we get $$\\frac{2K}{\\pi}=(1 + k^{2})^{-1/2}F\\left(\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{3}{8};1; X\\right)\\tag{8}$$ where $$X = 4x(1 - x) = \\frac{16k^{2}(1 - k^{2})^{2}}{(1 + k^{2})^{4}} = \\left(\\frac{4kk'^{2}}{(1 + k^{2})^{2}}\\right)^{2}$$ It's time to put $k = \\tan(\\pi/8) = \\sqrt{2} - 1$ to get $X = 1$ (check this!). And thus we finally get $$K(\\tan(\\pi/8)) = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}}}F(1/8, 3/8;1;1)$$ And then we use the formula $$F(a,b;c;1) = \\frac{\\Gamma(c)\\Gamma(c - a - b)}{\\Gamma(c - a)\\Gamma(c - b)}\\tag{9}$$ to get $$K(\\tan(\\pi/8)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2} + 1}\\pi}{2^{7/4}}\\cdot\\frac{\\Gamma(1/2)}{\\Gamma(7/8)\\Gamma(5/8)}$$ which simplifies to the given form using the reflection formula and $\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$. The transformation $(6)$ is non-obvious and it is used by Borwein brothers to link Ramanujan's alternative theory of theta functions (those dealing with $F(1/4, 3/4;1; x)$) with the standard theory (dealing with $F(1/2, 1/2;1;x)$). This is a key step in Borwein's proof of Ramanujan's famous series for $1/\\pi$ and this particular development is well covered in my blog post .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is about evaluating complete elliptic integrals K(k) for specific values of k: tan(π/8) and sin(π/12). The question body provides context, mentioning that these k values are singular moduli corresponding to n=2 and n=3. The main task is to show two specific integral evaluations using real analysis methods.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single condition on one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The elliptic integral K(k) is defined as the integral from 0 to π/2 of dx over sqrt(1 - k² sin²x). So that's an assumption about how K(k) is defined.\n\n2. The modulus k is a singular modulus, which in these cases is k = tan(π/8) for n=2 and k = sin(π/12) for n=3. But the problem specifically mentions these two k values, so each should be an assumption.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, there are two separate integrals to evaluate. So each integral corresponds to a specific k. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions should list each k value as separate assumptions?\n\nLooking at the example given, in the original problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. So here, we need to list the specific k values as assumptions, as they are given.\n\nSo for problem (2), k is tan(π/8), and for problem (3), k is sin(π/12). But the user wants to structure the problem as per the format. Wait, the example had the problem as a single problem, but here there are two separate integrals. The original question asks to \"Show that\" both equations (2) and (3). So the problem has two parts, but the format requires a single problem statement.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem had A(n) divisible by 91, the formatted problem kept the problem as is. So in this case, the problem part should state both equations (2) and (3) as the problem to be proven.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is to show both integrals equal the given expressions. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- k = tan(π/8) is a singular modulus for n=2.\n\n- k = sin(π/12) is a singular modulus for n=3.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't explicitly state that these k are singular moduli here; it's part of the context. However, in the problem statement, the user writes \"Show that\" the integrals equal the expressions given. So the key assumptions here are the specific k values. Therefore, each k is given as tan(π/8) and sin(π/12). Since the problem is to evaluate K(k) for these specific k's, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nk = tan(π/8),\n\nk = sin(π/12),\n\nBut wait, the problem has two separate integrals. Wait, but the problem statement is to show both equations (2) and (3). Therefore, the two k values are part of the problem statement.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition. Here, perhaps the assumptions would be:\n\n- k = tan(π/8),\n\n- k = sin(π/12),\n\nBut are there any other assumptions? The definition of K(k) is given in the question, but in the example, they didn't include the definition of A(n) in the assumptions, only the conditions on n. So here, the problem is to evaluate K(k) for those specific k values, so the main assumptions are the values of k. The definition of K(k) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions are just the specific k's.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, in this problem, the k values are given as tan(π/8) and sin(π/12), so these are the specific conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should list these two k values. However, each assumption is supposed to address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each k is a separate assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k = tan(π/8),\n\n- k = sin(π/12),\n\nBut the problem is to show both integrals. However, in the example, the problem had a single expression. Here, the problem has two parts. So maybe the problem statement is to show both equations (2) and (3). Therefore, the problem part would include both equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is split into two separate problems? But the user's example only had one problem. The original question here is a single question asking to show both integrals. Therefore, the formatted problem should include both as part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n\nk = tan(π/8),\n\nk = sin(π/12),\n\nProblem: Show that the integrals (2) and (3) equal the given expressions.\n\nWait, but the problem includes two separate equations. So in the Problem section, we need to write both. Let me check the example again. The example included the single expression for A(n). Here, it's two separate equations. So the problem should state both.\n\nBut in the user's example, the original problem had a single expression, so the formatted problem had that. Here, the problem has two integrals to evaluate, each for a different k. So the problem is to show both equations (2) and (3). Therefore, in the Problem section, both should be included, each with their respective k.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\nk = tan(π/8),\n\nk = sin(π/12),\n\nProblem: Show that\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-\\tan^{2}(\\pi/8)\\sin^{2}x}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2} +1} \\Gamma (1/8)\\Gamma (3/8)}{2^{13/4}\\sqrt{\\pi}}$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2}(\\pi/12)\\sin^{2}x}}=\\frac{3^{1/4}\\Gamma^{3}(1/3)}{2^{7/3}\\pi}.$$\n\nWait, but each k is part of the integral expressions. So each integral corresponds to one k. Therefore, the assumptions are that for the first integral, k is tan(π/8), and for the second, k is sin(π/12). Therefore, each k is a separate assumption. However, in the format, the assumptions are listed line by line, each as a separate condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe elliptic integral $K(k)$ is defined as $\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 - k^{2}\\sin^{2}x}}$.\n\n$k = \\tan(\\pi/8)$,\n\n$k = \\sin(\\pi/12)$.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n\n$$K(\\tan(\\pi/8)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2} +1} \\Gamma (1/8)\\Gamma (3/8)}{2^{13/4}\\sqrt{\\pi}}$$\n\nand\n\n$$K(\\sin(\\pi/12)) = \\frac{3^{1/4}\\Gamma ^{3}(1/3)}{2^{7/3}\\pi}.$$\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the integrals are written explicitly with the specific k values. So maybe the assumptions are the definitions of K(k), and the specific k values. However, in the example provided by the user, the definition of A(n) wasn't included in the assumptions, only the conditions on n. So perhaps here, the assumptions are only the specific k values. The definition of K(k) is part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to evaluate K(k) for those k's, the problem statement would be to evaluate those integrals, which are K(k) for those k's. Therefore, the problem can be written as:\n\nProblem: Show that $K(\\tan(\\pi/8))$ equals [expression] and $K(\\sin(\\pi/12))$ equals [expression].\n\nBut in the original problem, the integrals are written out explicitly, which is the definition of K(k). Therefore, perhaps the problem is to evaluate those specific integrals, which are K(k) for those k values. Therefore, the assumptions would be the specific k's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption is that k is a singular modulus (since the problem mentions that these k's are singular moduli), but the problem statement in the original question is to evaluate the integrals for those specific k's. However, the example given by the user didn't include the context from the original problem, only the specific conditions. So to follow the example, we should only include the specific k values as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, after all that, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$k = \\tan(\\pi/8)$,\n\n$k = \\sin(\\pi/12)$.\n\nProblem: Show that\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 - k^{2}\\sin^{2}x}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2} +1} \\Gamma(1/8)\\Gamma(3/8)}{2^{13/4}\\sqrt{\\pi}}$$\n\nwhen $k = \\tan(\\pi/8)$, and\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 - k^{2}\\sin^{2}x}} = \\frac{3^{1/4}\\Gamma^{3}(1/3)}{2^{7/3}\\pi}$$\n\nwhen $k = \\sin(\\pi/12)$.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question already includes these specific integrals. So in the formatted problem, we need to present the problem as given, with those integrals. Therefore, the assumptions are the k values, and the problem is to prove those two equations.\n\nBut how to structure this? The example included the expression with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So similarly here, the assumptions are the k values. Therefore, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$k = \\tan(\\pi/8)$,\n\n$k = \\sin(\\pi/12)$.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 - \\tan^{2}(\\pi/8)\\sin^{2}x}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2} +1} \\Gamma(1/8)\\Gamma(3/8)}{2^{13/4}\\sqrt{\\pi}}$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1 - \\sin^{2}(\\pi/12)\\sin^{2}x}} = \\frac{3^{1/4}\\Gamma^{3}(1/3)}{2^{7/3}\\pi}.$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"Show that\" both equations. So the problem is to prove both equations. Therefore, the assumptions are the two k values. Each k is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove both integrals equal those expressions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is split into two separate problems, but the original question is one problem with two parts. Since the user's example had one problem, here it's better to present both as part of a single problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should list the two k values as separate assumptions and then state both equations as the problem to prove.",
