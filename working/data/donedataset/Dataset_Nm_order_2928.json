    "Content": "One can prove that $\\sin n$ diverges, using the fact that the natural numbers modulo $2\\pi$ is dense. However, the case for $\\sin (n^2)$ looks much more delicate since this is a subsequence of the former one. I strongly believe that this sequence is divergent, but cannot prove it. In general, can one prove that $\\sin (n^a)$ diverges for $a>0$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $\\sin n^2$ has a limit $L$, then $\\cos n^2$ approaches $\\pm \\sqrt{1-L^2}$.\n$$\\sin(2n+1)=\\sin (n+1)^2\\cos n^2-\\cos(n+1)^2\\sin n^2$$\nThe right-hand side will have at most four limit points, depending on the signs of the cosines, but the left-hand side is dense in $[-1,1]$ Edit:  I think this extends to all $\\alpha$. If $0<\\alpha<1$, then $\\sin n^\\alpha$ is dense because many $n^\\alpha$ fit between multiples of $2\\pi$. If $1<\\alpha<2$, then $$(n+1)^\\alpha-n^\\alpha=\\alpha n^{\\alpha-1}+O(n^{\\alpha-2})$$ gets denser as $n$ gets large, so its sine is dense in $[-1,1]$. If $2<\\alpha<3$, then $$(n+2)^\\alpha-2(n+1)^\\alpha+n^\\alpha=\\alpha(\\alpha-1)n^{\\alpha-2}+O(n^{\\alpha-3})$$ is dense, and so on. All the sines of the left-hand sides have limits that can be written as polynomials of $L$ and $\\pm\\sqrt{1-L^2}$, and so have finitely many values.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure, listing assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"$\\sin(n^2)$ diverges,\" and the user is asking whether $\\sin(n^a)$ diverges for $a>0$. They mention that $\\sin n$ diverges because the natural numbers modulo $2\\pi$ are dense, but $\\sin(n^2)$ is a subsequence and seems more delicate.\n\nNow, to follow the example given, I need to extract the assumptions. The example listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. In the original problem example, the assumption was that $n$ is an integer and divisible by 7. \n\nLooking at the current problem: the question is about the divergence of $\\sin(n^2)$ and more generally $\\sin(n^a)$ for $a>0$. The key assumptions here would be the conditions under which the problem is posed. The user mentions that $a>0$, so that's one assumption. Also, they are considering $n$ as a natural number (since it's about sequences, n is typically in the natural numbers). However, the original problem about $\\sin n$ uses natural numbers modulo $2\\pi$, so the assumption here would be that $n$ is a natural number. \n\nWait, the example didn't include the domain of n in the assumption because it was stated in the problem (\"for every integer n\"), but in the formatted version, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" as an assumption. So in this case, the problem is about natural numbers (since n is a positive integer in sequences), but the user might just be considering n as an integer. However, in the original question, they mention \"natural numbers modulo 2π,\" which refers to n being a natural number. So maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- $a$ is a positive real number (since the question says $a>0$).\n\nBut wait, the problem is about $\\sin(n^a)$, and the user is asking for $a>0$. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- $a$ is a positive real number.\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n\nBut the example only includes assumptions that are directly part of the problem statement. The original problem in the example didn't have to state that n is an integer because it was given in the problem. Here, the problem is about the sequence $\\sin(n^a)$, so n is a natural number (as it's a sequence), and a is a positive real number. However, the user might be considering a as a positive real, but maybe in the problem, a is a fixed positive real and n varies over naturals. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. $n$ is a natural number.\n2. $a$ is a positive real number.\n\nBut the original problem mentions $a>0$ in the general question. So those are the two assumptions. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variable in the problem (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about the divergence of the sequence $\\sin(n^a)$, so the assumptions are that n is a natural number and a is a positive real number. However, the problem in the example didn't list the domain of the variable as an assumption if it was already in the problem statement. Wait, the original example's problem statement was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption listed was \"$n$ is an integer\". Here, the problem is \"can one prove that $\\sin(n^a)$ diverges for $a>0$?\" So the problem statement mentions $a>0$, so the assumption would be \"$a$ is a positive real number\". The variable n here is in the context of a sequence, so n is a natural number. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- $a$ is a positive real number.\n\nBut the original problem in the example didn't list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the problem statement was \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem's assumption includes \"$n$ is an integer\", which is already part of the original problem's statement. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. However, in the example, the user added an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no—the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists assumptions as \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by $7$.\" But wait, the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. This seems like a mistake. Perhaps the example provided by the user is incorrect. That complicates things. Because if in the example, the assumption added a condition not present in the original problem, then the user might be expecting to extract implicit assumptions. However, in the given example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". This suggests that maybe the user made an error in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had an additional condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote it wrong. This is confusing. However, I have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n- $a$ is a positive real number.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example seems to have added an extra assumption (divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example was wrong. Alternatively, maybe the example was for a different problem. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. The answer should not add assumptions that are not in the original problem. Therefore, the example provided by the user might be erroneous, but we need to follow their structure regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are as per the problem's inherent conditions. The question is about the divergence of sin(n^a) for a>0. The problem is to determine whether sin(n^a) diverges. The assumptions here are:\n\n- n is a natural number (since it's a sequence n=1,2,3,...)\n- a is a positive real number (as stated in the problem)\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list these two.\n\nProblem statement: Determine whether the sequence $\\sin(n^a)$ diverges for $a > 0$.\n\nBut the original question says \"can one prove that sin(n^a) diverges for a>0?\" So the problem is to prove divergence for a>0.\n\nSo formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is a positive real number,\n$n$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sin(n^a)$ diverges.\n\nBut wait, the original problem also specifically mentioned $\\sin(n^2)$ as a subsequence of $\\sin(n)$, but that sequence's divergence is more delicate. So perhaps the assumptions need to include that a is a positive real number, and n is a natural number. But in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem still listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, following that, here we should list:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is a natural number,\n$a$ is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sin(n^a)$ diverges.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"can one prove that sin(n^a) diverges for a>0?\" So the problem is to prove divergence for all a>0. Therefore, the assumptions are a>0 and n being natural numbers. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$a$ is a positive real number,\n$n$ is a natural number.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sin(n^a)$ diverges.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is one per line, addressing one property or condition. Here, two assumptions: one about a being positive real, another about n being natural number. The problem is to prove divergence of the sequence sin(n^a). That matches the required format.",
