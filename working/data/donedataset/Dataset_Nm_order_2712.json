    "Content": "This problem was given to me by an acquaintance during a basketball game. Define the sequence $a_n$ as follows: $$a_0=1, a_1=x+1, a_{n+2}=xa_{n+1}-a_n$$ Prove that there exists\ninfinitely many positive integers $x$ such that $a_n$ is never a\nprime. This looks like a very interesting problem, but I haven’t made any progress at all. The only thing I have in regards is that the polynomials $T_n(\\frac{x}2)$ satisfy the same recurrence relation, but do not have the same initial values. I think the problem should be true for any recurrent sequence of polynomials, but I cannot prove this. When I first read the problem, two well known theorems popped up in my mind: for a finite family of polynomials, there is a value at which they all assume a composite number, and any recurrent sequence is periodic modulo any number. So if we take $a_1, \\cdots a_s$ , and assure that $a_i$ is composite and divisible by a prime $p_i$ . And if we let the periods of $a_n$ mod $p_i$ be $m_i$ . If we can assure somehow that: $\\text{lcm}(m_1,\\cdots,m_s)\\le s$ , then we’d be done The source is: Korea Final Round $2019/3$ . The solution isn’t that hard and is motivated by the fact that: $a_na_{n+2}=a_{n+1}^2-(x+2).$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is essentially the AOPS answer. The formula $a_na_{n+2}=a_{n+1}^2-(x+2)$ , which is a consequence of $\\frac{a_{n+2}+a_n}{a_{n+1}}$ being constant motivates taking $x+2=a^2$ . Now: $a_na_{n+2}=(a_{n+1}-a)(a_{n+1}+a)$ If we can ensure that: $a_{n+2}>a_{n+1}+a$ then we’d be done, but it can be easily seen that this must be true. $a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}=(x-2)a_{n+1}+a_{n+1}-a_n>a_{n+1}-a_n>a_1-a_0=a^2-2>a$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure it according to the given format. Let's start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Polynomials that never produce primes\". The problem defines a sequence a_n with a_0=1, a_1=x+1, and the recurrence a_{n+2} = x*a_{n+1} - a_n. The task is to prove there are infinitely many positive integers x such that a_n is never prime. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The sequence a_n is defined with a_0 = 1. That's one assumption about the initial term.\n2. a_1 = x + 1. Another assumption about the next term.\n3. The recurrence relation: a_{n+2} = x*a_{n+1} - a_n. This applies to all n >= 0.\n4. The problem asks to show there are infinitely many positive integers x such that for all n, a_n is never prime. So the x's are positive integers, and the conclusion is about the sequence terms never being prime.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"positive integers x\" so x is a positive integer variable. So maybe that's another assumption: x is a positive integer. But the problem is to show infinitely many x exist with a certain property. However, in the problem statement, when structuring, we need to list the assumptions inherent to the problem setup. The problem itself is to prove the existence of infinitely many x such that for all n, a_n is composite.\n\nSo, in the Assumption section, we should list the given definitions and conditions:\n\n- a_0 is 1.\n- a_1 is x + 1.\n- The recurrence relation for a_{n+2}.\n- x is a positive integer. (But wait, the problem is about x being positive integers. So maybe the problem is for x in positive integers, but the question is to find infinitely many such x where the sequence a_n is never prime. So the assumption would include that x is a positive integer. But in the problem statement, it's part of the problem's requirement. Hmm, perhaps the problem's assumptions are the initial conditions of the sequence. Let me check the example given.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, n is any integer, but the formatted assumption added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the example might have been modified? Wait, no. Wait the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91\". Then the formatted problem's assumption lists n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is divisible by 7. That would imply that the problem might have been misrepresented in the example. Wait, perhaps the original problem had additional conditions not stated? Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, perhaps in our problem, the assumptions are the initial conditions and the recurrence. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- a_0 = 1\n- a_1 = x + 1\n- For all n ≥ 0, a_{n+2} = x*a_{n+1} - a_n\n- x is a positive integer (since the problem is about positive integers x)\n\nBut the problem is to prove that infinitely many x (positive integers) exist such that for all n, a_n is never prime. So the problem statement includes that x is a positive integer and the rest are the definitions of the sequence. So in the Assumption section, we need to list the initial terms, the recurrence, and perhaps that x is a positive integer. However, the problem is to find x such that for all n, a_n is composite. So maybe the assumption is that x is a positive integer (since the problem is about x being positive integers), and the sequence is defined as per the given recurrence and initial terms.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Which suggests that perhaps the user in the example added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, perhaps as a mistake. But maybe in their example, the original problem had a different setup. Wait, maybe the example is correct. Let me check again: the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but if n is divisible by 7, then perhaps the problem is only for such n? But the original problem states \"for every integer n\". That seems conflicting. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, in our current problem, we need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem as per the given format.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. a_0 = 1\n2. a_1 = x + 1\n3. For each n ≥ 0, a_{n+2} = x * a_{n+1} - a_n\n4. x is a positive integer\n\nBut the problem is to prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers x such that for all n, a_n is never prime. So the problem statement would be: Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers x such that for all n ≥ 0, a_n is never prime.\n\nBut in the problem statement given by the user, the original problem was: \"Prove that there exists infinitely many positive integers x such that a_n is never a prime.\"\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- a_0 = 1\n- a_1 = x + 1\n- For each n ≥ 0, a_{n+2} = x * a_{n+1} - a_n\n- x is a positive integer\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers x such that for all n ≥ 0, a_n is never prime.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to structure the problem as per the example. In the example, assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So each initial term is a separate assumption. The recurrence relation is another assumption. The fact that x is a positive integer is part of the problem's conclusion, but in the problem statement, x is given as a variable. Wait, but the problem is about choosing x such that... So perhaps the assumption is that x is a positive integer, but the problem is to show that infinitely many such x exist. Hmm. The problem states \"there exists infinitely many positive integers x\". So the problem is to prove existence, so the assumption would be that x is a positive integer (since we are considering x in that context), and the problem is to show infinitely many such x where the sequence a_n is never prime.\n\nBut the user's example structured the problem as:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had that condition. But perhaps the example was misrepresented. Anyway, the key is to list the assumptions inherent in the problem as given. In our current problem, the user is to list the assumptions from the problem statement. So the original problem defines a sequence with specific initial terms and recurrence. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- a_0 = 1\n- a_1 = x + 1\n- For each n ≥ 0, a_{n+2} = x * a_{n+1} - a_n\n- x is a positive integer\n\nThe problem is to prove there are infinitely many such x where all a_n are composite.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The first three define the sequence, the fourth defines the domain of x. The problem is to show infinitely many x (positive integers) exist such that for all n, a_n is never prime.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \na_0 = 1,\na_1 = x + 1,\nfor each n ≥ 0, a_{n+2} = x*a_{n+1} - a_n,\nx is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers x such that a_n is never prime for all n ≥ 0.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem had some conditions split. For example, in the original example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two assumptions. So similarly, here, the assumptions should list each condition separately, even if they apply to the same object. So \"x is a positive integer\" is one assumption, and the rest are about the sequence. Thus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \na_0 is 1,\na_1 is x + 1,\nfor each integer n ≥ 0, a_{n+2} = x*a_{n+1} - a_n,\nx is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers x such that a_n is never prime for all n ≥ 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"for each integer n ≥ 0\" is part of the recurrence's condition. But in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", so maybe we should also state \"n is a non-negative integer\" as an assumption. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was about n being any integer, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in our current problem, the sequence is defined for n ≥ 0, so n is non-negative integer. So perhaps we need to include that as an assumption. Wait, the problem says \"the sequence a_n is defined as follows: a_0=1, a_1=x+1, a_{n+2}=x a_{n+1}-a_n\". So n is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- For each non-negative integer n, a_{n+2} = x*a_{n+1} - a_n\n\nBut in the example, they didn't list n being an integer as an assumption, but in the formatted problem, they did. So perhaps to follow the example's structure, we need to list each assumption separately. Let's see:\n\nIn the example:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo the assumptions are split into separate lines for each condition. So in our case:\n\nAssumption:\n\na_0 is 1,\na_1 is x + 1,\nfor each non-negative integer n, a_{n+2} = x*a_{n+1} - a_n,\nx is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers x such that a_n is never prime for all n ≥ 0.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each line is a separate condition. \"for each non-negative integer n, a_{n+2} = x*a_{n+1} - a_n\" is one assumption. The initial terms are separate. x being a positive integer is another assumption. The problem is about proving the existence of infinitely many x (within the positive integers) such that all terms a_n are composite.\n\nSo I think this is the correct structuring. The user also mentions that the solution involves the identity a_n a_{n+2} = a_{n+1}^2 - (x + 2), but that's part of the solution hint, not the problem statement. The problem statement is as given.",
