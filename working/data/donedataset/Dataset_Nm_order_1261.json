    "Content": "How can we prove, without employing the aid of residues or various transforms, that, for $n>2$ $$\\int_0^\\infty\\Big(\\sqrt[n]{1+x^n}-x\\Big)dx~=~\\frac12\\cdot{-1/n\\choose+1/n}^{-1}$$ Motivation: In my previous question , thanks to Will Jagy's simple but brilliant answer, I was able to express the area of the superellipse $x^n+y^n=r^n$, for odd values of $n=2k+1$, with $k\\in\\mathbb N^*$, as $A_n=r^2\\displaystyle\\cdot{2/n\\choose1/n}^{-1}+r^2\\cdot{-1/n\\choose+1/n}^{-1}$, where the first term, representing the surface inside the first sector or quadrant, comes from a simple evaluation of the beta function . My fruitless efforts and endeavors: $\\big(1\\big).$ Breaking up the integration interval into $(0,1)$ and $(1,\\infty)$, expanding the integrand into an appropriate binomial series for each of the two cases, and then switching the order of summation and integration. In the end, this made me rewrite the initial question in terms of an infinite series, but led me no closer to finding an answer: $$2a\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty{a\\choose k}\\Bigg(\\frac1{k+a}+\\frac1{k-2a}\\Bigg)={-a\\choose+a}^{-1}-1.$$ $\\big(2\\big).$ Letting $x=\\sqrt[n]{\\sinh^2t~}$. Needless to say, that did not get me very far either. $\\big(3\\big).$ Letting $x^n=u$, we are able to obtain an expression in terms of incomplete beta functions .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that the Assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object each. The Problem part should state the problem clearly after filtering out the unrelated info.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: the title is about proving an integral equals a certain expression involving a binomial coefficient. The question mentions that this is for n > 2. The user also talks about their previous work and attempts, which might not be necessary for the assumptions.\n\nSo, first, I need to identify the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is the nth root of (1 + x^n) minus x. The problem states that n > 2. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The variable of integration is x, and the integral is over the interval from 0 to infinity.\n2. The parameter n is a real number (probably, but since the original problem uses n > 2 without specifying, maybe we just take n as a real number greater than 2? Wait, but in the context of such integrals, n is often a positive integer. However, the problem statement just says n > 2. The answer involves a binomial coefficient with -1/n and +1/n, which suggests that n could be a positive real number. But maybe the problem is considering n as a positive integer greater than 2. However, the original problem doesn't specify, so I should stick to what's given. The problem says \"for n > 2\", so the assumption is n is a real number greater than 2? Or maybe integer? The original problem doesn't specify, but since the previous question mentioned odd values of n=2k+1, but here it's for n > 2. The problem here doesn't restrict to integers. The integral expression doesn't require n to be integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is taken over x from 0 to infinity.\n- The parameter n is a real number greater than 2.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the integral equals (1/2) multiplied by the inverse of the binomial coefficient (-1/n choose 1/n).\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"for n > 2\". So that's a condition on n. Also, the integrand is sqrt[n]{1 + x^n} - x. So the integral is well-defined for x >= 0. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. The integration variable x ranges from 0 to ∞.\n2. The parameter n is a real number with n > 2.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. Wait, no. Wait in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem was for every integer n, so the assumption should just be n is an integer. But the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user is instructing me to follow the example. Wait, the user says: \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" So in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. Wait, but that changes the problem. Wait, maybe that example is a mistake? But perhaps the user intended that the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for integers n divisible by 7. But the original problem states \"for every integer n\". So that seems conflicting. Maybe there was a mistake in the example, but regardless, the user wants the current problem structured properly.\n\nIn the current problem, the original title says \"Proving that [integral] = ... for n > 2\". The question body repeats \"for n > 2\". So the key assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is over x from 0 to infinity.\n- The parameter n is a real number greater than 2.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the two assumptions are:\n\n1. The integration is over x from 0 to ∞.\n2. The parameter n satisfies n > 2.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"n is a real number greater than 2\" is one assumption. Since the original problem states \"for n > 2\" without specifying, but in mathematical contexts, such parameters are usually real unless stated otherwise, especially since the integral and binomial coefficient here can accept real n. So combining both into one assumption. However, the example had two separate lines: one for n being integer, another for n divisible by 7. So if the current problem's assumptions are two: integration interval and n > 2, then each on a separate line.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over x from 0 to ∞,\nn is a real number greater than 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\left(\\sqrt[n]{1+x^n} - x\\right)dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dbinom{-1/n}{1/n}^{-1}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the binomial coefficient is written as {-1/n\\choose +1/n}. So need to check the LaTeX. The user wrote:\n\n\"Prove that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\Big(\\sqrt[n]{1+x^n}-x\\Big)dx~=~\\frac12\\cdot{-1/n\\choose+1/n}^{-1}$$\"\n\nSo the binomial coefficient is \\dbinom{-1/n}{1/n}^{-1}, but written as {-1/n \\choose +1/n}.\n\nSo the problem statement should have the binomial coefficient with upper index -1/n and lower index +1/n. So in LaTeX, that would be \\dbinom{-1/n}{1/n}^{-1}.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over x from 0 to ∞,\nn is a real number greater than 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\left(\\sqrt[n]{1+x^n} - x\\right)dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\dbinom{-1/n}{1/n}^{-1}.$$\n\nBut let me check again. The original problem's title says \"for n > 2\", so the assumption is n > 2, but not necessarily an integer. So the two assumptions are integration from 0 to infinity, and n > 2. Each on separate lines. The problem is to prove the integral equals that expression. The user's example had assumptions split into separate lines even if they applied to the same object, like n is integer, n divisible by 7. So here, even though both are about the integral's domain and the parameter n, they should be separate lines.\n\nHence, that should be correct.",
