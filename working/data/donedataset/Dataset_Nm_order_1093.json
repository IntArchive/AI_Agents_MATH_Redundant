    "Content": "We know that: Spin structures will exist if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2(M)\\in H^2(M,\\mathbb Z/2)$ of $M$ vanishes. Can someone use simple words and logic to show why the above is true? Note. More precisely, from Wikipedia : André Haefliger found necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a spin structure on an oriented Riemannian manifold (M,g). The obstruction to having a spin structure is certain element [k] of $H^2(M,\\mathbb{Z}/2)$. For a spin structure the class [k] is the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2(M)\\in H^2(M,\\mathbb{Z}/2)$ of M. Hence, a spin structure exists if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2(M)\\in H^2(M,\\mathbb Z/2)$ of M vanishes. A. Haefliger (1956). \"Sur l’extension du groupe structural d’un espace fibré\". C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 243: 558–560.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Spin structures and the second Stiefel-Whitney class are themselves not particularly simple, so I don't know what kind of an answer you're expecting. Here is an answer which at least has the benefit of being fairly conceptual. First some preliminaries. Recall that a real vector bundle of rank $n$ on a space is the same thing as a principal $\\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$-bundle (namely its frame bundle) and that principal $G$-bundles are classified by maps into the classifying space $BG$. In particular, a smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ has a tangent bundle which has a classifying map $M \\to B\\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$. Additional information allows us to reduce the structure group of this classifying map as follows: If $M$ is equipped with a Riemannian metric then the transition maps for the tangent bundle can be chosen to lie in $\\text{O}(n) \\subseteq \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})$, so we get a classifying map $M \\to B \\text{O}(n)$. If $M$ is in addition equipped with an orientation then (possibly by definition, depending on your definition of an orientation) the transition maps for the tangent bundle can in addition be chosen to lie in $\\text{SO}(n) \\subseteq \\text{O}(n)$, so we get a classifying map $M \\to B \\text{SO}(n)$. If $M$ is in addition equipped with a spin structure then (probably by definition, depending on your definition of a spin structure) the above classifying map can be lifted to a classifying map $M \\to B \\text{Spin}(n)$. Now, what does this have to do with the second Stiefel-Whitney class? First let me tell a simpler story about the first Stiefel-Whitney class. The first Stiefel-Whitney class is a cohomology class $w_1 \\in H^1(B\\text{O}(n), \\mathbb{F}_2)$ giving a characteristic class for $\\text{O}(n)$-bundles which vanishes iff those bundles can be reduced to $\\text{SO}(n)$-bundles. Why? One reason is the following. $w_1$ can be regarded as a homotopy class of maps $B \\text{O}(n) \\to B \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (where I use $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ to mean the cyclic group of order $2$). Now, it's known that any such map comes from a homotopy class of maps $\\text{O}(n) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$, and there's an obvious candidate for such a map, namely the determinant. This gives an exact sequence $$1 \\to \\text{SO}(n) \\to \\text{O}(n) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to 1$$ which, after applying the classifying space functor, gives a homotopy fibration $$B \\text{SO}(n) \\to B \\text{O}(n) \\xrightarrow{w_1} B \\mathbb{Z}_2$$ exhibiting $B \\text{SO}(n)$ as the homotopy fiber of the first Stiefel-Whitney class. The homotopy fiber of a map between (pointed) spaces is analogous to the kernel of a map between groups; in particular, if $w : B \\to C$ is a map of groups, then a map $f : A \\to B$ satisfies $w \\circ f = 0$ if and only if $f$ factors through a map $A \\to \\text{ker}(w)$. The same kind of thing is happening here: a classifying map $f : M \\to B \\text{O}(n)$ satisfies that $w_1 \\circ f$ is homotopic to a constant map if and only if it factors up to homotopy through the homotopy fiber $M \\to B \\text{SO}(n)$. Now the reason I gave such a sophisticated description of orientations is that the story for spin structures is completely parallel. Namely, the second Stiefel-Whitney class is a cohomology class $w_2 \\in H^2(B\\text{SO}(n), \\mathbb{F}_2)$ which can be regarded as a homotopy class of maps $B \\text{SO}(n) \\to B^2 \\mathbb{Z}_2$. You can produce such classes by applying the classifying space functor to a homotopy class of maps $\\text{SO}(n) \\to B \\mathbb{Z}_2$, or equivalently a cohomology class in $H^1(\\text{SO}(n), \\mathbb{F}_2)$, and there's a natural candidate for such a class, namely the cohomology class classifying the nontrivial double cover $\\text{Spin}(n) \\to \\text{SO}(n)$. This also turns out to imply that we get a homotopy fibration $$B \\text{Spin}(n) \\to B \\text{SO}(n) \\xrightarrow{w_2} B^2 \\mathbb{Z}_2$$ exhibiting $B \\text{Spin}(n)$ as the homotopy fiber of the second Stiefel-Whitney class, and if you believe this then it again follows from the universal property of the homotopy fiber that a map $f : M \\to B \\text{SO}(n)$ lifts to a map $M \\to B \\text{Spin}(n)$ iff $w_2 \\circ f$ is homotopic to a constant map. (This homotopy fibration is a \"delooping\" of the more obvious homotopy fibration $B \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to B \\text{Spin}(n) \\to B \\text{SO}(n)$ coming from the short exact sequence $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\text{Spin}(n) \\to \\text{SO}(n) \\to 1$.) This argument can be continued all the way up the Whitehead tower of $B \\text{O}(n)$; the next step is a string structure, etc.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. Let me first understand their example.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving that a certain expression A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted version lists assumptions and then the problem. The assumptions here were that \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but in the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n,\" so why did the formatted assumption include \"n is divisible by 7\"? That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the example: the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" but the formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like a mistake because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example is flawed. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, or maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo? Wait, regardless, I need to focus on the task.\n\nThe user's instruction is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as per their format. The example they gave includes assumptions that might not be in the original problem. Wait, in their example, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like an error. Maybe the example is just illustrative of the format, not a correct transformation. So perhaps the user's example is not accurate, but they want the format regardless.\n\nMoving on. The current problem to format is about spin manifolds and the second Stiefel-Whitney class. The question asks to explain why a spin structure exists if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes, using simple words and logic.\n\nSo according to the user's format, I need to list assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object, then state the problem.\n\nFirst, let's parse the original question. The key points are:\n\n1. Spin structures exist on an oriented Riemannian manifold M if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2(M) vanishes in H^2(M, Z/2).\n\n2. The user wants an explanation in simple terms why this is true.\n\nThe assumptions here would relate to the properties of the manifold M and the conditions required for a spin structure. Let me think. The problem statement as given by the user is the equivalence between existence of spin structures and vanishing of w_2. The necessary assumptions for this theorem to hold would be:\n\n- M is an oriented Riemannian manifold. (This is mentioned in the Wikipedia quote provided in the question.)\n\n- The obstruction to a spin structure is the second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2(M). \n\nSo to structure this:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- M is an oriented Riemannian manifold.\n\n- The second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2(M) is an element of H^2(M, Z/2).\n\n- A spin structure exists on M if and only if w_2(M) vanishes.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show why that equivalence holds. Wait, no, the original problem is asking for an explanation of why the existence of spin structures is equivalent to the vanishing of w_2(M). So the problem is to prove or explain that equivalence. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions required for this theorem. The theorem's statement is the problem itself, so the assumptions would be the hypotheses of the theorem.\n\nSo, the theorem is: If M is an oriented Riemannian manifold, then a spin structure exists on M if and only if w_2(M) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- M is an oriented Riemannian manifold.\n\n- The second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2(M) is defined as an element of H^2(M, Z/2).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is asking to show why the existence of spin structures is equivalent to w_2(M) vanishing. Therefore, the problem is to prove this statement. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which this holds, which according to the question is for an oriented Riemannian manifold. The Haefliger result is cited, which says that the obstruction is [k] = w_2(M).\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- M is an oriented Riemannian manifold.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that a spin structure exists on M if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2(M) ∈ H²(M, ℤ/2) vanishes.\n\nBut the original question also mentions that spin structures exist if and only if w_2(M) vanishes. Wait, the problem is to explain why this is true. So the problem is to show the equivalence. The user wants a structured problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions that M is an oriented Riemannian manifold, and then the problem is to show the equivalence between spin structure existence and vanishing of w_2(M).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\". So maybe in that example, there was a mistake. But in our current problem, the main assumption is that M is an oriented Riemannian manifold, as that's the condition under which Haefliger's theorem applies. The other conditions are part of the problem's statement.\n\nHence, the formatted version would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- M is an oriented Riemannian manifold.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that a spin structure exists on M if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2(M) ∈ H²(M, ℤ/2) vanishes.\n\nAlternatively, if more precise, perhaps more assumptions. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question says: \"We know that: Spin structures will exist if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2(M) ∈ H²(M, Z/2) of M vanishes. Can someone use simple words and logic to show why the above is true?\"\n\nThe note adds that Haefliger found necessary and sufficient conditions for a spin structure on an oriented Riemannian manifold M, where the obstruction is [k] = w_2(M).\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n1. M is an oriented Riemannian manifold.\n\n2. The obstruction to having a spin structure is the class [k] in H²(M, Z/2).\n\nBut the problem is to show that [k] is exactly w_2(M), hence the equivalence.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the question is to show why spin structures exist iff w_2(M) vanishes. So the problem is to prove this statement. Therefore, the assumptions would be that M is an oriented Riemannian manifold (since Haefliger's result is for oriented Riemannian manifolds), and the problem is to show the equivalence.\n\nTherefore, the formatted version would have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- M is an oriented Riemannian manifold.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that a spin structure exists on M if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class w₂(M) ∈ H²(M, ℤ/2) vanishes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another assumption, but I think that's the main one. The original problem doesn't mention anything else. The Stiefel-Whitney classes are defined for the tangent bundle, so perhaps an assumption that M is a smooth manifold with tangent bundle, but that's generally included in being a Riemannian manifold. Since the problem is about spin structures, which are related to the tangent bundle's frame bundle, the key assumption is that M is an oriented Riemannian manifold.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be structured as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n- $M$ is an oriented Riemannian manifold.\nProblem:\nProve that a spin structure exists on $M$ if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2(M) \\in H^2(M, \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ vanishes.\n###",
