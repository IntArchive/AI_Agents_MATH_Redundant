    "Content": "Can you provide a proof or a counterexample to the following claim : Let $p,q,r$ be three consecutive prime numbers such that $p\\ge 11 $ and $p<q<r$ , then $\\frac{1}{p^2}< \\frac{1}{q^2} + \\frac{1}{r^2}$ . I have tested this claim up to $10^{10}$ . For $p>5$ we get $\\pi(2p)-\\pi(p) \\ge 2$  , a result by Ramanujan .\nThis means that $q<2p$ and $r<2p$ , so $\\frac{1}{2p}<\\frac{1}{q}$ and $\\frac{1}{2p}<\\frac{1}{r}$ which implies $\\frac{1}{p} < \\frac{1}{q} + \\frac{1}{r}$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "The inequality holds for all $p$ large enough. Let $a>1$ be such that $a^{-2}+a^{-4}=1$ and $p_n$ be the $n$-th prime.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about an inequality involving three consecutive primes. The original question mentions that p, q, r are three consecutive primes with p ≥ 11 and p < q < r. The claim is that 1/p² is less than 1/q² + 1/r². \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that p, q, r are consecutive primes, starting from p which is at least 11. Also, they follow the order p < q < r. The user tested this up to 10^10. Then they mention some results by Ramanujan about the number of primes between p and 2p, leading to q and r being less than 2p. \n\nWait, the original problem's assumptions should be listed one by one. Let's see: p is a prime number, q is the next prime after p, r is the next prime after q. So they are consecutive primes. Also, p ≥ 11. The ordering p < q < r is given. So each assumption should be a separate line. \n\nThe problem is to prove or find a counterexample to the inequality 1/p² < 1/q² + 1/r² under these conditions. \n\nThe user also tried squaring the inequality 1/p < 1/q + 1/r, which comes from q and r being less than 2p (from Ramanujan's result), leading to 1/(2p) < 1/q and similarly for r. Adding those gives 1/p < 1/q + 1/r. Squaring both sides gives 1/p² < (1/q + 1/r)² = 1/q² + 2/(qr) + 1/r². But the user wants to show 1/p² < 1/q² + 1/r², so they need to get rid of the 2/(qr) term. The question is how to do that.\n\nBut the task here is to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem statement, not to solve it. So the key is to extract all the conditions given. The user mentions that p, q, r are three consecutive primes, p ≥ 11, p < q < r. The problem is to prove the inequality. The other parts are their attempt and references to Ramanujan, which might not be necessary for the problem's assumptions. The Ramanujan part is their reasoning, but the actual problem's assumptions are just the primes being consecutive starting at p ≥11. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- p, q, r are three consecutive prime numbers,\n- p ≥ 11,\n- p < q < r.\n\nThe problem is to prove or provide a counterexample to 1/p² < 1/q² + 1/r².\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Can you provide a proof or a counterexample to the following claim : Let p,q,r be three consecutive prime numbers such that p ≥ 11 and p<q<r, then 1/p² < 1/q² + 1/r².\"\n\nSo the assumptions are precisely those: p, q, r are consecutive primes, p ≥11, and p < q < r. The problem is the inequality. The rest of the user's text is their attempt and context, which isn't part of the problem's assumptions. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list each condition as separate lines.",
