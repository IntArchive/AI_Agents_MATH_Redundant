    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is the Fourier inversion formula in disguise. In case you have never encountered this theorem before, let me prove the following version (which is obviously far from optimal). Proposition. Let $F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt$ be the Laplace transform of $f : [0,\\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ . Assume that the following technical conditions hold with some $g : [0,\\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}$ : $f(t) = f(0) + \\int_{0}^{t} g(u) \\, du$ . (In particular, $g$ is the 'derivative' of $f$ .) Both $f(t)e^{-\\sigma t}$ and $g(t)e^{-\\sigma t}$ are Lebesgue-integrable on $[0, \\infty)$ . Then for any $s > 0$ , we have $$ \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\sigma-iR}^{\\sigma+iR} F(z)e^{s z} \\, dz = f(s). $$ Proof. Define $S(x) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{\\sin t}{t} \\, dt$ . Then $S(x)$ is bounded, and by Dirichlet integral , we have $$ \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} S(Rx) = H(x) := \\begin{cases}\n1, & x > 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}, & x = 0 \\\\\n0, & x < 0\n\\end{cases} $$ (Obviously $H$ denotes the Heaviside step function.) Now we have \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\sigma-iR}^{\\sigma+iR} F(z)e^{s z} \\, dz\n&= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-R}^{R} F(\\sigma + i\\xi)e^{s(\\sigma+i\\xi)} \\, d\\xi \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-R}^{R} \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-(\\sigma+i\\xi)t} \\, dt \\right)e^{s(\\sigma+i\\xi)} \\, d\\xi.\n\\end{align*} By Fubini's theorem, we can interchange the order of integral to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\sigma-iR}^{\\sigma+iR} F(z)e^{s z} \\, dz\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-(t-s)\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-R}^{R} e^{(s-t)i\\xi} \\, d\\xi \\right) \\, dt \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-(t-s)\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\sin R(t-s)}{\\pi (t-s)} \\right) \\, dt\n\\end{align*} By the assumption, both $f(t)e^{-\\sigma t}$ and $(f(t)e^{-\\sigma t})' = (f'(t) - \\sigma f(t))e^{-\\sigma t}$ are Lebesgue-integrable. In particular, this tells that $f(t)e^{-\\sigma t}$ converges to $0$ as $t\\to\\infty$ . So by integration by parts, \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\sigma-iR}^{\\sigma+iR} F(z)e^{s z} \\, dz\n&= - f(0)e^{s\\sigma} S(-Rs)\n- \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (f(t)e^{-(t-s)\\sigma})' S(R(t-s)) \\, dt.\n\\end{align*} As $R \\to \\infty$ , the right-hand side converges to \\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\sigma-iR}^{\\sigma+iR} F(z)e^{s z} \\, dz\n&= - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (f(t)e^{-(t-s)\\sigma})' H(t-s) \\, dt \\\\\n&= - \\left[ f(t)e^{-(t-s)\\sigma} \\right]_{t=s}^{t=\\infty}\n = f(s).\n\\end{align*} (Pushing the limit inside the integral is justified by the dominated convergence theorem.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to know why the inverse Laplace transform is given by that integral expression. They mentioned the Bromwich integral and are looking for a derivation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. The Laplace transform of a function f(t) is F(s) = ∫₀^∞ f(t) e^{-st} dt. The inverse transform is supposed to recover f(t) from F(s), and the formula given is a complex integral along a vertical line in the complex plane.\n\nHmm, the Bromwich integral is indeed the inverse Laplace transform. But how is this derived from the forward transform? Maybe I should think about the relationship between Laplace and Fourier transforms. Since the Laplace transform is similar to a Fourier transform when s is a complex variable. \n\nWait, the Fourier inversion formula states that if F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), then f(t) can be recovered by integrating F(ω) e^{iωt} over all ω. Perhaps the inverse Laplace transform is analogous but adjusted for the complex exponent.\n\nBut the Laplace transform integrates from 0 to ∞, while the Fourier transform integrates from -∞ to ∞. So maybe we can extend f(t) to be zero for t < 0, making it a causal function, and then relate it to the Fourier transform. If we let s = σ + jω, then the Laplace transform becomes F(σ + jω) = ∫₀^∞ f(t) e^{-σ t} e^{-jωt} dt. That looks like the Fourier transform of f(t) e^{-σ t}. \n\nBy the Fourier inversion formula, the inverse would be f(t) e^{-σ t} = (1/(2π)) ∫_{-∞}^∞ F(σ + jω) e^{jωt} dω. Multiplying both sides by e^{σ t} gives f(t) = (1/(2π)) ∫_{-∞}^∞ F(σ + jω) e^{(σ + jω)t} dω. Changing variables to s = σ + jω, so ds = j dω, then the integral becomes (1/(2πj)) ∫_{σ - j∞}^{σ + j∞} F(s) e^{st} ds. That seems to derive the Bromwich integral formula.\n\nSo the assumptions would involve the conditions under which this inversion is valid. For the Fourier inversion to hold, f(t) e^{-σ t} must be absolutely integrable, meaning that σ is chosen such that F(s) converges. Also, f(t) should be of exponential order, and perhaps piecewise continuous. The contour of integration must be to the right of all singularities of F(s), which is the region of convergence.\n\nBut the original problem didn't specify these conditions. The user just asked why the inverse is given by that integral. So the key assumptions would relate to the properties of F(s) and f(t) that make this inversion valid. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. For example:\n\n- F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).\n- The integral is along a vertical line Re(s) = σ in the complex plane.\n- σ is chosen such that the line Re(s) = σ is within the region of convergence of F(s).\n- f(t) is piecewise continuous.\n- f(t) is of exponential order.\n\nBut I need to check if these are all necessary and how to list them. Since the problem states \"provided that F(s) = ...\", the main assumption is that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). The other conditions (like σ being in the ROC, f(t) being piecewise continuous and of exponential order) are implicit for the inversion to hold. However, the user might not have mentioned them. Since the example given in the format didn't include all the implicit mathematical assumptions (like convergence, etc.), maybe only the direct assumptions from the problem statement are needed.\n\nIn the original problem, the user wrote: \"provided that F(s) = ∫₀^∞ f(t) e^{-st} dt\". So the main assumption is that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). However, in the example provided by the user, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was to prove for every integer n. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Let me check.\n\nWait the original problem in the example says: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Maybe the original problem had a different assumption. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in the example. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be n is an integer. But the formatted problem in the example added \"n is divisible by 7\", which isn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. So maybe the user intended to present an example where they filtered out some information? Or perhaps the original problem had a typo. This might affect how I structure the current problem.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking about the inverse Laplace transform formula. The problem as stated in the question is: Why is f(t) equal to that integral provided that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t)? So the main assumption is that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). However, the inversion formula requires certain conditions on f(t) and F(s) to hold. So in the formatted problem, should these conditions be listed as assumptions?\n\nLooking back at the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. So maybe in the example, there was a mistake. Therefore, when applying the format, perhaps only the explicit assumptions given in the problem should be listed. But in the example, the user added an extra assumption not present in the original problem. Hmm. That's confusing. Wait, perhaps the original problem was different. Let me re-read the example.\n\nThe example's original problem was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is n is any integer. The formatted problem's assumption seems to include an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That would restrict the problem, which might be incorrect. Perhaps the example was a mistake. Therefore, when structuring the current problem, maybe I should only list the assumptions explicitly mentioned in the problem. \n\nIn the current problem, the user wrote: \"provided that F(s) = ∫₀^∞ f(t) e^{-st} dt\". So the main assumption is that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). The question is asking to derive the inverse formula. However, in the answer, we need to list the assumptions. But the problem as stated doesn't mention the conditions on f(t) or F(s) for the inverse to exist. So perhaps the only explicit assumption is that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). But in reality, the inverse Laplace transform requires more conditions. However, since the user hasn't specified them, maybe we should stick to what's given. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that if F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t), then the inverse is given by that integral. The derivation would require certain conditions like f(t) being of exponential order, piecewise continuous, and the integral is taken over a vertical line in the complex plane where Re(s) > σ₀, the abscissa of convergence. But the user didn't mention these in the problem. So the question is: should these be considered as assumptions?\n\nIn the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that maybe the example had a typo, and perhaps the original problem intended to have n divisible by 7. Therefore, maybe the instructions are to extract assumptions from the problem statement, not necessarily the mathematical conditions required. But in this case, the problem states \"provided that F(s) = ...\", which is the main assumption. However, the integral's path (σ - j∞ to σ + j∞) implies that σ is chosen such that the path is in the region of convergence. But is that an assumption? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).\n- The integral is taken along the vertical line Re(s) = σ in the complex plane.\n- σ is chosen such that all singularities of F(s) lie to the left of Re(s) = σ.\n\nBut the user's question didn't mention σ. The formula includes σ in the integral limits. So maybe the assumption is that σ is a real number such that the integral converges. However, the problem as stated by the user does not mention this. So perhaps the only explicit assumption is that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). The rest are part of the problem's statement.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem split into two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. So maybe there was a mistake in the example. Given that, perhaps the user wants us to extract all mathematical assumptions required for the problem, even if not explicitly stated. In that case, for the inverse Laplace transform, we need:\n\n- F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).\n- f(t) is piecewise continuous on [0, ∞).\n- f(t) is of exponential order, i.e., there exists constants M, α, T such that |f(t)| ≤ Me^{α t} for t > T.\n- The integral is taken along a vertical line Re(s) = σ where σ > α (the abscissa of convergence).\n\nBut since the problem statement doesn't mention these, but the formula includes σ, perhaps σ is part of the problem's parameters, so the assumption is that σ is chosen appropriately. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).\n- f(t) is piecewise continuous on [0, ∞).\n- f(t) is of exponential order.\n- σ is a real number greater than the exponential order's exponent.\n\nBut again, the problem as stated by the user does not mention these. However, the example seems to have included an assumption not in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Therefore, perhaps the intended format is to list all necessary mathematical assumptions required for the problem, even if not explicitly stated. But how to balance that with the user's example?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was incorrect, and the actual instruction is to structure the problem based on the given information, filtering out unrelated parts. The user mentions \"filtered the unrelated informations\". In the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that can't be right. If it's for every integer n, then n is an integer is the only assumption. Including n divisible by 7 would restrict it. So the example might have a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions explicitly given in the problem, and not add any others. \n\nIn the current problem, the user states: \"provided that F(s) = ∫₀^∞ f(t) e^{-st} dt\". So the main assumption is that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). The problem is to show that f(t) is given by the Bromwich integral. Therefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\nF(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).\nProblem:\nProve that $$f(t) = \\frac{1}{2πj}\\int_{\\sigma-j\\infty}^{\\sigma+j\\infty} F(s) e^{st} \\, ds.$$\n\nBut the example included additional assumptions not present in the original problem, which complicates things. If the example is incorrect, perhaps the user's actual instruction is to structure the problem based on the given information, extracting only the necessary conditions. Since the original problem in the example added an assumption not present (n divisible by 7), but that might be a mistake, perhaps the correct way is to list only the assumptions mentioned in the problem. \n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the assumption is that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t), as stated. The problem is to derive the inverse formula. However, the integral involves σ, which needs to be in the region of convergence. But since the user's question includes the integral with σ, maybe the assumption includes that σ is chosen such that the integral converges. However, the problem statement doesn't mention this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the problem's statement, the user wrote the integral with σ-j∞ to σ+j∞, so the assumption is that the integral is taken along the vertical line Re(s) = σ. But how is that an assumption? It's part of the problem's expression. The example's original problem had A(n) defined with 5^n and 6^n, but the formatted problem listed assumptions about n. So perhaps the format requires breaking down all the conditions that each object must satisfy. \n\nIn the current problem, f(t) is related to F(s) via the Laplace transform. The integral expression for f(t) involves integrating F(s) e^{st} over a vertical line in the complex plane. The assumptions would be:\n\n- F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).\n- The integral is evaluated along a vertical line Re(s) = σ in the complex plane.\n- σ is chosen such that the path of integration lies to the right of all singularities of F(s).\n- f(t) is piecewise continuous.\n- f(t) is of exponential order.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. However, the user's question does not mention these, except for F(s) being the Laplace transform. But if following the example where additional assumptions were added, maybe we need to include these. But without the user specifying, it's ambiguous. \n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps the safest way is to include the explicit assumptions mentioned in the problem. The user wrote: \"provided that F(s) = ∫₀^∞ f(t) e^{-st} dt\". So the main assumption is that F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). The rest might be considered part of the problem's conditions, not assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nF(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).\nProblem:\nProve that $$f(t) = \\frac{1}{2πj}\\int_{\\sigma-j\\infty}^{\\sigma+j\\infty} F(s) e^{st} \\, ds.$$\n\nHowever, the original example added an assumption not present in the problem (n divisible by 7). If that was intentional, perhaps the user wants to include implicit mathematical assumptions necessary for the proof. In the case of the inverse Laplace transform, necessary assumptions would include f(t) being piecewise continuous and of exponential order, and σ being in the region of convergence. But since the user didn't mention these, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the example provided by the user seems to have added an extra assumption, perhaps the task is to list all necessary mathematical assumptions required for the problem to hold, even if not explicitly stated. Therefore, for the inverse Laplace transform, the assumptions would be:\n\n- F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).\n- f(t) is piecewise continuous on [0, ∞).\n- f(t) is of exponential order.\n- σ is a real number greater than the abscissa of convergence of F(s).\n\nEach of these is a single condition applied to one object. Hence, the formatted problem would list these as assumptions. The problem then is to prove the inverse formula given these conditions.",
