    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a quick way to get what you want: Note that $\\mathbb{R}P^{n-1}\\hookrightarrow\\mathbb{R}P^n$ induces isomorphisms on $H_i(-;\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ for $i\\le n-1$. Now $x$ generates $H_1(\\mathbb{R}P^n;\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ and we want to show that $H^*(\\mathbb{R}P^n;\\mathbb{Z}_2)\\cong\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]/(x^{n+1})$, so by induction we only need to show that $x\\cup x^{n-1}\\ne 0$. Now just plug-n-chug through Poincare-duality with cup/cap products: $[\\mathbb{R}P^n]\\cap(x\\cup x^{n-1})=([\\mathbb{R}P^n]\\cap x)\\cap x^{n-1}=1$, where this last equality is because $[\\mathbb{R}P^n]\\cap x$ is a generator of $H_{n-1}(\\mathbb{R}P^n;\\mathbb{Z}_2)$! Thus $x^n\\ne 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the cohomology ring of real projective space RP^n with coefficients in Z/2 is isomorphic to Z/2[x]/(x^{n+1}). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of cohomology rings, especially for projective spaces. For complex projective spaces, the cohomology ring is Z[x]/(x^{n+1}) with x in degree 2. But here it's real projective space, and coefficients are mod 2. I remember that real projective spaces have more complicated cohomology because they aren't orientable in general, except in even dimensions maybe? But with Z/2 coefficients, orientation issues might not matter since everything is oriented in a sense over Z/2.\n\nThe question mentions building an isomorphism by sending x to a codimension 1 submanifold. In RP^n, a codimension 1 submanifold would be RP^{n-1}, right? But the user is confused why this isn't a 0-class in homology. Wait, homology and cohomology are dual, but over Z/2, Poincaré duality holds even for non-orientable manifolds. So maybe for RP^n, even though it's not orientable over Z, it's orientable over Z/2, so Poincaré duality applies. That might be why duality can be used here despite n being odd.\n\nSo the problem is to construct the ring isomorphism. The standard approach for cohomology rings of projective spaces involves the first Stiefel-Whitney class or the generator of the cohomology. In H*(RP^n; Z/2), the cohomology groups are Z/2 in each dimension up to n, and the ring structure is truncated at degree n. The generator x is in degree 1, and x^{n+1} = 0. So the isomorphism should map x to the generator of H^1(RP^n; Z/2), and then multiplicatively build up the higher degrees.\n\nBut how does the submanifold come into play? The Poincaré duality would relate cohomology classes to homology classes via the cap product. A codimension 1 submanifold RP^{n-1} in RP^n would correspond to a class in H_1(RP^n; Z/2) via duality? Wait, no. Poincaré duality in dimension n would say that H^k(M; Z/2) is isomorphic to H_{n−k}(M; Z/2). So for RP^n, H^1 would correspond to H_{n−1}. But RP^{n-1} is a codimension 1 submanifold, so its homology class is in H_{n−1}(RP^n; Z/2). Under Poincaré duality, this would correspond to H^1(RP^n; Z/2), which is the generator x. So the class [RP^{n-1}] in H_{n−1} corresponds to x in H^1. Then the cup product in cohomology corresponds to the intersection product in homology, but over Z/2, intersections are manageable.\n\nSo maybe the isomorphism is defined by sending x to the dual of [RP^{n-1}], which generates H^1. Then, the multiplicative structure would make x^{k} correspond to the cup product of k copies of this generator, which should generate H^k. Since the highest degree is n, x^{n+1} is zero. Therefore, the cohomology ring is Z/2[x]/(x^{n+1}).\n\nBut the user is confused about why RP^{n-1} isn't a 0-class. Maybe in homology with Z coefficients, but with Z/2 coefficients, since RP^n is Z/2-orientable, the fundamental class exists, so [RP^{n-1}] is non-zero. In Z coefficients, if n is even, RP^n is non-orientable, so the top homology is zero, but with Z/2, it's always orientable. Hence, the submanifold RP^{n-1} represents a non-trivial class in H_{n−1}(RP^n; Z/2), which via duality gives a non-trivial cohomology class in H^1.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are related to the coefficients being Z/2, allowing Poincaré duality despite orientability issues, and the structure of the cohomology ring as a truncated polynomial ring. The problem is to establish the ring isomorphism, which uses these properties.",
