    "AcceptedAnswer": "Start with the facts you know, i.e. that you have a 2-by-2 complex matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}w&z\\\\c&d\\end{pmatrix}$, such that when you multiply it by its adjoint $\\begin{pmatrix}w^*&c^*\\\\z^*&d^*\\end{pmatrix}$ you get $\\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}$. That means you have $ww^*+zz^* = 1$, $cc^*+dd^* = 1$ and $cw^*+dz^*=0$. Don't forget the other way, so you get $ww^*+cc^* = 1$, $zz^*+dd^* = 1$ and $w^*z+c^*d=0$. With these equations you should notice something immediately about both $cc^*$ and $dd^*$. You can work from there.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to show that every 2x2 unitary matrix has a specific form involving complex numbers w, z, and a real number θ. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a unitary matrix is. From the problem statement, a unitary matrix is an invertible matrix whose inverse is its adjoint (conjugate transpose). So, for a matrix U to be unitary, it must satisfy U* U = I, where U* is the adjoint and I is the identity matrix.\n\nLet me start by considering a general 2x2 complex matrix. Let's denote it as:\nU = [[a, b], [c, d]]\nwhere a, b, c, d are complex numbers.\n\nThe adjoint of U, denoted U*, is the conjugate transpose, so:\nU* = [[a*, c*], [b*, d*]]\n\nNow, the condition for U being unitary is U* U = I. Let's compute U* U:\n\nMultiplying U* and U:\nFirst row, first column: a*a + c*c\nFirst row, second column: a*b + c*d\nSecond row, first column: b*a + d*c\nSecond row, second column: b*b + d*d\n\nThis product must equal the identity matrix I, which is:\n[[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nSo, we have the following equations:\n1. |a|² + |c|² = 1 (from top-left entry)\n2. a*b* + c*d* = 0 (from top-right entry)\n3. b*a* + d*c* = 0 (from bottom-left entry, which is the conjugate of the top-right entry since the product must be Hermitian)\n4. |b|² + |d|² = 1 (from bottom-right entry)\n\nNow, we have four equations here. Let's see how we can relate these to the desired form of the matrix. The target matrix is:\n[[w, z], [-e^{iθ} z*, e^{iθ} w*]]\n\nComparing this with our general U = [[a, b], [c, d]], we can set a = w, b = z, c = -e^{iθ} z*, d = e^{iθ} w*. Let's check if this satisfies the unitary conditions.\n\nFirst, let's compute the adjoint of this target matrix. The adjoint would be:\n[[w*, -e^{-iθ} z], [z*, e^{-iθ} w]]\n\nNow, multiplying the adjoint with the original matrix:\nFirst entry (top-left): w*w + (-e^{-iθ} z)(-e^{iθ} z*) = |w|² + z z* = |w|² + |z|²\nSince in the problem's target matrix, this should equal 1. So, |w|² + |z|² = 1, which matches equation 1 if we set a = w and c = -e^{iθ} z*. Then |a|² + |c|² = |w|² + |e^{iθ} z*|² = |w|² + |z|² = 1, which works.\n\nSimilarly, the bottom-right entry of the product would be (z*)(z) + (e^{-iθ} w)(e^{iθ} w*) = |z|² + |w|² = 1, which matches equation 4.\n\nFor the off-diagonal entries, let's compute the top-right entry of the product. It would be w*(-e^{iθ} z*) + (-e^{-iθ} z)(e^{iθ} w*) = -w* e^{iθ} z* + (-e^{-iθ} z e^{iθ} w*) = -e^{iθ} w* z* - z w*. Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, the adjoint matrix's first row is [w*, -e^{-iθ} z], and the original matrix's second column is [z, e^{iθ} w*]. So the top-right entry of the product is w* z + (-e^{-iθ} z)(e^{iθ} w*) = w* z - z w*. Since e^{-iθ} e^{iθ} = 1. But w* z - z w* = w* z - w* z = 0, which matches equation 2. Wait, but this seems to only hold if z w* is the same as w* z, but since these are complex numbers, multiplication is commutative. So yes, w* z - z w* = 0. So that works out.\n\nSimilarly, the bottom-left entry is the conjugate of the top-right, which would also be zero. So all four equations are satisfied if the matrix has the given form.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says to show that every unitary matrix has this form, so we need to start from a general unitary matrix and show that it can be written in that form with some θ, w, z. \n\nLet's take U = [[a, b], [c, d]] unitary. Then, from U* U = I:\n\n1. |a|² + |c|² = 1\n2. a* b + c* d = 0\n3. |b|² + |d|² = 1\n4. The other equations are conjugates, so they don't add new information.\n\nWe need to express a, b, c, d in terms of w, z, θ. Let's set a = w and b = z. Then, we need to find c and d such that they can be expressed in terms of w, z, and θ. From equation 2: a* b + c* d = 0 => w* z + c* d = 0. Let's solve for c and d. Also, from equation 1 and 3: |w|² + |c|² = 1 and |z|² + |d|² = 1.\n\nSuppose we set d = e^{iθ} w*, where θ is real. Then |d|² = |e^{iθ} w*|² = |w|². Then equation 3 becomes |z|² + |w|² = 1, which matches equation 1. So that works if |w|² + |z|² =1, which is consistent.\n\nNow, substituting d = e^{iθ} w* into equation 2: w* z + c* e^{iθ} w* = 0. Let's factor out w*: w*(z + c* e^{iθ}) =0. Since w can be non-zero (unless the matrix is singular, but U is invertible, so determinant non-zero), we can divide both sides by w* (which is non-zero), so z + c* e^{iθ} =0 => c* = -z e^{-iθ} => c = -e^{iθ} z*. \n\nTherefore, c = -e^{iθ} z* and d = e^{iθ} w*. This gives the desired form. The angle θ comes into play because when we set d = e^{iθ} w*, we can always write a complex number of modulus |w| as e^{iθ} w* for some θ, since |w| is fixed. Wait, actually, if |d| = |e^{iθ} w*| = |w|, but from equation 3, |d|² = |w|², which is consistent with equation 1. \n\nBut why can we write d in terms of w* and θ? Since d must satisfy |d| = |w|, but w is a complex number. Let me think. Suppose |d| = |w|, then d can be written as e^{iθ} times some complex number with modulus |w|. Since w* has modulus |w|, then d = e^{iθ} w* would have modulus |w|, which matches the requirement. Therefore, θ is introduced to account for the argument of d. \n\nTherefore, by setting d = e^{iθ} w*, we can parameterize d in terms of w and a real angle θ. Then c is determined as -e^{iθ} z*. This seems to work. \n\nSo, putting it all together, any unitary matrix U can be written in the given form with w = a, z = b, θ real, and c, d as above. This satisfies all the unitary conditions. Therefore, this form covers all possible 2x2 unitary matrices. \n\nI should also check the determinant condition. Since U is unitary, its determinant has absolute value 1. Let's compute the determinant of the given form. The determinant is w * e^{iθ} w* - z*(-e^{iθ} z*) = e^{iθ} (|w|² + |z|²). But since |w|² + |z|² =1 (from equation 1), the determinant is e^{iθ} * 1 = e^{iθ}, which has absolute value 1, as required. So this is consistent.\n\nTherefore, every 2x2 unitary matrix can be written in this form. The key steps were using the definition of unitary matrices, expanding the product U* U = I, and then solving for the entries c and d in terms of a, b, and θ, which parameterizes the possible arguments.",
