    "Content": "Let $n$ and $k$ be integers with $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. Show that: $$\\sum_{k=1}^n {n \\choose k}{n \\choose k-1} = \\frac12{2n+2 \\choose n+1} - {2n \\choose n}$$ I was told this is supposed to use a combinatorial proof and while I'm not that comfortable with that, many similar proofs use a mathematical proof that shows equality. Any guidance would be much appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The Combinatorial Proof goes as follows: Consider three boxes $A$,$B$ and $C$. Box $A$ contains $n$ balls, Box $B$ contains $n$ balls, and Box $C$ contains $2$ balls. We want to choose $n+1$ balls out of these three boxes. The total number of ways is $C(2n+2,n+1)$. This can be split as follows. You choose $2$ balls from box $C$ and the remaining $n-1$ balls from boxes $A$ and $B$ or you choose $1$ ball from box $C$ and the remaining $n$ balls from boxes $A$ and $B$ or you choose all the $n+1$ balls from boxes $A$ and $B$. $\\textbf{Case 1:}$ Suppose you choose $2$ balls from box $C$. There is only one way of choosing these $2$ balls from the box $C$. We now need the number of ways of choosing $n-1$ balls from boxes $A$ and $B$. Say if you choose $k$ balls from box $A$, you need to choose $n-k-1$ balls from box $B$. Number of ways of choosing $k$ balls from box $A$ and $n-k-1$ balls from box $B$ is given by $C(n,k)C(n,n-k-1)$. Now summing over all possible values of $k$ from $0$ to $n-1$ we get, Total number of ways is $\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(n,k)C(n,n-k-1)$. Now, $C(n,r) = C(n,n-r)$. (For a combinatorial argument of this see the bottom of the post). Hence, Total number of ways for the current case is $1 \\times \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(n,k)C(n,k+1) = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} C(n,k-1)C(n,k)$. $\\textbf{Case 2:}$ Suppose you choose $1$ ball from the box $C$. You need to now choose the remaining $n$ balls from boxes $A$ and $B$. Number of ways of choosing $1$ ball from box $C$ is given by $C(2,1) = 2$. There are $2n$ balls in total in boxes $A$ and $B$ and hence the total number of ways of choosing $n$ balls from boxes $A$ and $B$ is $C(2n,n)$. Hence, the total number of ways for the current case is $2 \\times C(2n,n)$. $\\textbf{Case 3:}$ Suppose you choose all the $n+1$ balls from boxes $A$ and $B$. Number of ways of choosing no balls from box $C$ is $1$. We now need to count the number of ways of choosing $n+1$ balls from boxes $A$ and $B$. This is similar to Case 1 and we get the total number of ways for this case is $1 \\times \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} C(n,k)C(n,n+1-k) = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} C(n,k)C(n,k-1)$. (Note: Here $k$ goes from $1$ to $n$ since we need to choose atleast $1$ from one of the boxes and we can choose atmost $n$ from each box). (Also Note: You could directly state that Case 1 and Case 3 should be the same since $C(2n,n-1)=C(2n,n+1)$) Combine all the three cases to get $2 \\times \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} C(n,k)C(n,k-1) + 2 \\times C(2n,n) = C(2n+2,n+1)$. Now do the desired algebraic manipulation to get the result. $\\textbf{APPENDIX:}$ The combinatorial argument of $C(n,r) = C(n,n-r)$ is that the number of ways of selecting $r$ out of $n$ things is the same as the number of ways of discarding $n-r$ out of $n$ things.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given math problem into the specified format. The original question is about proving a combinatorial identity using a combinatorial proof. The identity is the sum from k=1 to n of binomial coefficients (n choose k) times (n choose k-1), which equals half of (2n+2 choose n+1) minus (2n choose n). \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example provided in the format had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem states that n and k are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤n. However, the sum is over k from 1 to n, so k is a dummy variable here. The key assumptions would be about n. The problem might not have any additional constraints beyond n being a positive integer since the summation is general for 1 ≤k ≤n. Wait, but the problem statement says \"Let n and k be integers with 1 ≤k ≤n\". However, in the sum, k is the index variable, so perhaps the main assumption is that n is an integer, and k runs from 1 to n. But since k is a summation index, maybe the key assumption is just that n is a positive integer.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is a combinatorial identity. The user might not have explicit divisibility conditions, but the assumptions would be about the variables involved. Since the problem states \"Let n and k be integers with 1 ≤k ≤n\", but k is a summation index, so the main assumption is that n is an integer such that n ≥1. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- 1 ≤k ≤n (but since k is a dummy variable in the summation, maybe this isn't an assumption but part of the problem statement. Wait, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\nn is an integer,\nk is an integer,\n1 ≤k ≤n.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"Let n and k be integers with 1 ≤k ≤n\". But when structuring the problem, in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Hmm, maybe the example included an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem, perhaps due to a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That's a mistake. But maybe the example was a typo or error. So, in the current problem, we should be careful to only list the assumptions given in the problem. The problem says \"Let n and k be integers with 1 ≤k ≤n\". So the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- k is an integer,\n- 1 ≤k ≤n.\n\nBut since the sum is over k from 1 to n, perhaps the k is bound by the summation, so the main assumption is that n is an integer with n ≥1. But the problem statement explicitly mentions both n and k. However, in combinatorial proofs, typically n is a positive integer, and k ranges from 1 to n. So maybe the key assumptions are:\n\nn is a positive integer.\n\nBecause if n=0, the sum would be from k=1 to 0, which doesn't make sense. So the problem likely assumes n ≥1. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n ≥1.\n\nBut the original problem states \"Let n and k be integers with 1 ≤k ≤n\". So perhaps the user needs to list all the given conditions as assumptions. However, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That suggests that perhaps the example was incorrect, and the assistant should list the actual assumptions given. In the current problem, the problem states \"Let n and k be integers with 1 ≤k ≤n\". So the assumptions are:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nk is an integer,\n\n1 ≤k ≤n.\n\nBut since k is the index variable in the summation, perhaps the key assumption is just n is an integer with n ≥1. However, in the example, they included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the problem said \"for every integer n\". That might have been an error in the example. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list the given conditions as assumptions. So here, the problem says \"Let n and k be integers with 1 ≤k ≤n\". But since the summation is over k from 1 to n, the main assumption is that n is an integer such that n ≥1. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n ≥1.\n\nBecause k is just a dummy variable in the summation, so the conditions on k are part of the summation definition, not external assumptions. Hence, the problem's assumptions are that n is an integer with n ≥1. The original problem statement might mention k, but since k is part of the summation, it's not an assumption per se. So the formatted problem's assumption section should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem: Show that ∑_{k=1}^n C(n,k)C(n,k-1) = (1/2)C(2n+2, n+1) - C(2n, n).\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not require n ≥1 as an explicit assumption because the summation from k=1 to n would imply that n is at least 1. But since n could be 0, but then the sum would be empty. However, the problem statement likely assumes n is a positive integer. So to be safe, include both n is integer and n ≥1.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥1.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{n}{k-1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\binom{2n+2}{n+1} - \\binom{2n}{n}.$$",
