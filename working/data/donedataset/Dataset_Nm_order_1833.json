    "Content": "The least common multiple of $\\{1,2,...,n\\}$ is greater than $2^{n-1}$ for any $n \\ge 3$ . I found this in a MATHEMATICA book, but I don't know how to prove this. Can you help me? [Edit: This thread has a discussion of an asymptotic stronger result, but that relies on the Prime Number Theorem . What else is known about this? JL]",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This paper proves the identity $$\n\\operatorname{lcm}(1,2,\\dots,n)=n \\operatorname{lcm}\\left(\\binom{n-1}{0}, \\binom{n-1}{1},\\dots,\\binom{n-1}{n-1}\\right)\n$$ by computing the number of factors of $p$ which appear in each expression, for all primes $p$ . From this it follows that $$\n\\operatorname{lcm}(1,2,\\dots,n) \\geq n \\binom{n-1}{\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\rfloor} \\geq \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{k}=2^{n-1}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"least common multiple of {1,2,...,n} is bigger than 2^{n-1}\". The user wants to prove that for any n ≥ 3, the LCM of the set {1, 2, ..., n} is greater than 2^{n-1}. They found this in a Mathematica book but don't know how to prove it. There's an edit mentioning a discussion about an asymptotic stronger result using the Prime Number Theorem, but the user is asking for other known proofs or methods.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem states that for any n ≥ 3, the LCM of {1,2,...,n} exceeds 2^{n-1}. \n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n- n is an integer (since we're talking about the set {1,2,...,n}).\n- n is greater than or equal to 3.\n\nThese are the two main conditions given. The problem is to prove that the LCM of the set is greater than 2^{n-1} under these assumptions. \n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this problem, the only conditions are n is integer and n ≥ 3. There's no mention of divisibility here. So, the assumptions should list each condition separately. \n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem is about LCM of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to n, and comparing it to 2^{n-1}. The key conditions are that n is an integer and n ≥ 3. There are no other specific constraints mentioned, like n being even or odd, or prime. The edit mentions a stronger asymptotic result using the Prime Number Theorem, but the original problem doesn't require that. The user just wants the proof for the given inequality.\n\nTherefore, structuring this, the assumptions are:\n- n is an integer.\n- n is greater than or equal to 3.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the least common multiple of {1, 2, ..., n} is greater than 2^{n-1}.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is on a separate line and addresses one property. The first assumption is about n being an integer, the second about n being at least 3. There's no mention of divisibility by specific numbers here, so those two assumptions are sufficient.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't explicitly state that n is an integer, but since we're talking about the set {1,2,...,n}, it's implied that n is a positive integer. However, to be thorough, the assumption should list that n is an integer. Also, the problem states \"for any n ≥ 3\", so n must be an integer greater than or equal to 3.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user had both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, similarly, n is an integer and n ≥ 3. So each condition is a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the least common multiple of {1, 2, ..., n} is greater than 2^{n-1}.\n\nYes, that seems right. The user is asking for a proof under those two conditions. The edit mentions a stronger result using the Prime Number Theorem, but that's additional context and not part of the original problem's assumptions. The original problem's assumptions are just n being an integer ≥3.",
