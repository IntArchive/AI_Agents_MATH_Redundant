    "AcceptedAnswer": "First observe that $$x^2-2 x+2 \\log{(1+x)} = 2 \\sum_{k=3}^{\\infty} (-1)^{k+1} \\frac{x^k}{k}$$ The integral is then equal to $$2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k+3} \\int_0^1 dx \\frac{x^k}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$ Now, we will need separate treatments for the even and odd terms (1): $$\\int_0^1 dx \\frac{x^k}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\displaystyle 1}{\\displaystyle 2^{2 k}} \\displaystyle \\binom{2 k}{k} \\frac{\\pi}{2} & k \\: \\text{even}\\\\ \\frac{\\displaystyle 2^{2 k-1}}{\\displaystyle k \\binom{2 k}{k}} &  k \\: \\text{odd} \\end{cases} $$ That is, the integral is now equal to the difference between two sums: $$ \\pi  \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2 k+3} \\frac{1}{2^{2 k}} \\binom{2 k}{k} - \\frac12 \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{ k+1} \\frac{\\displaystyle 2^{2 k}}{\\displaystyle k \\binom{2 k}{k}}$$ We now evaluate each sum in turn.  For the first, let $$f(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2 k+3} \\frac{1}{2^{2 k}} \\binom{2 k}{k} x^{2 k+3} $$ Then $$f'(x) = x^2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{2 k}} \\binom{2 k}{k} x^{2 k} = \\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$ which means that, enforcing the condition that $f(0)=0$ (2), $$f(x) = \\int dx \\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\arcsin(x)-\\frac{1}{2} x \\sqrt{1-x^2}$$ The sum in question is equal to $f(1) = \\pi/4$.  For the second sum, define $$g(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k( k+1)} \\frac{\\displaystyle 2^{2 k}}{\\displaystyle \\binom{2 k}{k}} x^{k+1}$$ Then (see this answer for a reference) $$g''(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(4 x)^k}{\\displaystyle \\binom{2 k}{k}} = \\frac{\\displaystyle 1+\\frac{ \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)}{\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}}{1-x}$$ Integrating twice and enforcing the condition that $g(0)=0$ and $g'(0)=0$, we find that (3) $$g(x) = x+\\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)^2-2 \\sqrt{x(1-x)} \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right) $$ The second sum is then $$g(1) = 1+\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}$$ The value of the integral we seek is then equal to $$\\pi f(1) - \\frac12 g(1) = \\pi \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac12 \\left ( 1+ \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} \\right ) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{8} - \\frac12$$ as was to be shown. ADDENDUM I think I should fill in some gaps of the above proof.  I will go through each intermediate result in turn so that the solution is more self-contained.  The integrals I evaluate here are not as difficult as they appear, although there is one subtlety that should be pointed out. Equation (1) $$\\int_0^1 dx \\frac{x^k}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$ a) $k$ even, i.e., $k=2 m$, $m \\in \\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ Sub $x=\\sin{t}$ to see that this integral is equal to $$I_m = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} dt \\, \\sin^{2 m}{t} $$ Integrate by parts to see that $$\\begin{align}I_m &= -\\underbrace{\\left [ \\cos{t} \\sin^{2 m-1}{t} \\right ]_0^{\\pi/2}}_{\\text{this}=0} + (2 m-1) \\underbrace{\\int_0^{\\pi/2} dt \\, \\cos^2{t} \\sin^{2 m-2}{t}}_{\\cos^2{t}=1-\\sin^2{t}}\\\\ &= (2 m-1) I_{m-1} - (2 m-1) I_m\\end{align}$$ Thus, $$I_m = \\frac{2 m-1}{2 m} I_{m-1} = \\frac{(2 m-1)(2 m-3)\\cdots (3)(1)}{(2 m)(2 m-2)\\cdots (2)} I_0$$ where $I_0 = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} dt = \\pi/2$.  We may rearrange the above result by multiplying the numerator by the denominator, and we have for even values of $k$: $$I_m = \\frac{1}{2^{2 m}} \\binom{2 m}{m} \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$ b) $k$ odd, i.e., $k=2 m+1$, $m \\in \\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ We perform identical manipulations as above, but now we get that $$I_m = \\frac{(2 m)(2 m-2)\\cdots (2)}{(2 m+1)(2 m-1)\\cdots (3)} I_1 $$ where $I_1 = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} dt \\, \\sin{t} = 1$.  Using similar manipulations as above (except we multiply the denominator by the numerator), we have $$I_m = \\frac{1}{2 m+1} \\frac{2^{2 m}}{\\displaystyle \\binom{2 m}{m}} $$ You may note, however, that this is not the result I displayed in the proof.  Good reason: this form would complicate the series approach to evaluating the sum.  To this effect, let's map $m \\mapsto m-1$ and consider $m \\in \\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}$.  Then $$I_m = \\frac{2^{2 m-2}}{2 m-1} \\frac{[(m-1)!]^2}{(2 m-2)!} = \\frac{2^{2 m-1}}{\\displaystyle m \\binom{2 m}{m}} $$ as asserted. Equation (2) $$\\underbrace{\\int dx \\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}}_{x=\\sin{t}} = \\int dt \\, \\sin^2{t} = \\frac{t}{2} - \\frac12 \\sin{t} \\cos{t}$$ form which the posted result follows. Equation (3) Here we have 2 integrations.  First, $$g'(x) = \\underbrace{\\int dx \\frac{1+\\frac{\\arcsin{\\sqrt{x}}}{\\sqrt{x (1-x)}}}{1-x}}_{x=u^2} = \\underbrace{2 \\int du \\, \\frac{u + \\frac{\\arcsin{u}}{\\sqrt{1-u^2}}}{1-u^2}}_{u=\\sin{t}} = 2 \\int dt \\, \\tan{t} + 2 \\int dt \\, t \\sec^2{t} $$ Do the second integral by parts: $$2 \\int dt \\, t \\sec^2{t} = 2 t \\tan{t} - 2 \\int dt \\, \\tan{t}$$ Thus we have a fortuitous cancellation, and using $t=\\arcsin{\\sqrt{x}}$, and enforcing $g'(0)=0$, we have $$g'(x) = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{1-x}}\\arcsin{\\sqrt{x}}$$ So, second, we must integrate this result to get $g(x)$.  We use similar substitutions as above (i.e., $x=u^2$, $u=\\sin{t}$): $$g(x) = 4 \\int du \\, \\frac{u^2}{\\sqrt{1-u^2}} \\arcsin{u} = 4 \\int dt \\, t \\, \\sin^2{t}$$ Now, integrate by parts: $$4 \\int dt \\, t \\, \\sin^2{t} = 2 t (t - \\sin{t} \\cos{t}) - 2 \\int dt \\, (t - \\sin{t} \\cos{t}) = t^2 - 2 t \\sin{t} \\cos{t} + \\sin^2{t} +C $$ Now, use $t = \\arcsin{\\sqrt{x}}$ and the fact that $g(0)=0$ and get $$g(x) = \\arcsin{\\left ( \\sqrt{x}\\right )}^2 - 2 \\sqrt{x (1-x)} \\arcsin{\\left ( \\sqrt{x}\\right )} + x$$ as posted above.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object, line by line. Then the problem is restated concisely.\n\nThe problem given here is an integral from 0 to 1 of a complex function, and the result is supposed to be π²/8 - 1/2. The original question is asking how to prove this identity.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The integral is from 0 to 1, so the limits of integration are 0 and 1. The integrand is (x² - 2x + 2 ln(1+x)) divided by (x³ times sqrt(1 - x²)). The problem is to prove that this integral equals π²/8 - 1/2. \n\nLooking at the example, assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral's variable is x, and the function is defined on (0,1). But what are the assumptions here? The function involves ln(1+x) and sqrt(1 - x²), which are defined for x in (-1,1), but since the integral is from 0 to 1, we need to consider the behavior at the endpoints, especially near x=1 where sqrt(1 - x²) approaches zero, and near x=0 where the denominator has x³. However, the problem states that the integral is convergent? Or is that an assumption? Wait, the problem is to prove the equality, so maybe the assumptions include that the integral exists (is convergent). But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, perhaps the main assumptions are about the integrand's domain and the convergence of the integral. But since the user's example didn't mention convergence as an assumption, maybe we need to list the integral's limits and the form of the integrand.\n\nWait, the example's assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions given in the problem. In the current problem, the integral is definite from 0 to 1, so the limits are part of the problem statement. The integrand's structure is part of the problem, not an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the conditions that x is in [0,1], the integrand is defined as given, and maybe the convergence of the integral at the bounds. However, the problem as stated doesn't mention any restrictions; it just presents the integral. Since the user's example extracted the variable's conditions, but here the variable x is integrated over [0,1], so maybe there are no additional assumptions. Wait, but the integrand has a sqrt(1 - x²) in the denominator, so near x=1, the denominator approaches zero, and near x=0, the denominator has x³. So the integrand has potential singularities at both ends. But the problem states the integral equals a finite value, so it's assumed that the integral converges. However, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's given conditions. Here, the integral is presented as a given, so perhaps the only assumption is that the integral is convergent. But how to phrase that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the integral being from 0 to 1 and the integrand being as given. The example included assumptions about the variable n, which were part of the problem's hypotheses. In this integral problem, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. Wait, but the original example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. The original problem here is to prove the integral equals that expression. So maybe the only assumption is that the integral exists (i.e., converges). But in the example, the assumptions were conditions on n. Here, since the integral is presented as is, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, but the user's format requires listing assumptions. Wait, the example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original example was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumptions included that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, no, the original example's problem was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions list n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should be n is an integer. But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion here.\n\nWait, looking back: The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer, but the formatted example added n divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Maybe the user intended a different example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should be n is an integer, and the problem is to show divisibility by 91. But if the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, then the example is correct. But given the user wrote the original problem as \"for every integer n\", but formatted it with n divisible by 7, that seems conflicting. So perhaps there's an error in the example. But regardless, I have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nGiven that, for the integral problem, the user's example suggests extracting conditions from the problem. The problem here is to prove the integral equals π²/8 - 1/2. The integral is from 0 to 1, so the limits are fixed. The integrand is given. Are there any implicit assumptions? For example, that the integral converges. Since the problem states the integral equals a finite value, it's assumed convergent. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is defined as (x² - 2x + 2 ln(1+x)) / (x³ sqrt(1 - x²)).\n- The integral converges.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, perhaps the first two points are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Wait, but the example listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So in the current problem, perhaps the equivalent would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable in the interval (0, 1),\nThe function (x² - 2x + 2 ln(1+x)) / (x³ sqrt(1 - x²)) is integrable over [0, 1].\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's setup, but the format requires listing assumptions. The user's example included assumptions even when the problem didn't state them (like in the original problem, it was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7). That suggests perhaps the user's example was incorrect, but I need to follow the format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as stated in the example had a typo, and the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, hence the assumptions.\n\nBut given the current problem, which is an integral, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is as given.\n- The integral converges.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the variable x is integrated over [0,1], so maybe the assumption is that x is in [0,1], but that's part of the integral's limits. Alternatively, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond what's given, so the assumptions section could be empty, but the format requires listing them. Since the user's example included assumptions even when the problem didn't state them (like n divisible by 7), maybe I need to extract all possible conditions from the problem.\n\nWait, looking at the problem: It's an integral from 0 to 1 of a certain function. The integrand has a logarithm term ln(1+x), which is defined for x > -1, so in [0,1], that's fine. The denominator has x³ and sqrt(1 - x²). At x=0, the denominator is zero (x³ term), so the integrand has a singularity there. Similarly, at x=1, sqrt(1 - x²) is zero, another singularity. Therefore, the integral is improper at both endpoints. So the assumptions might include that the integral converges (i.e., is an improper Riemann integral). So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is an improper Riemann integral at both limits (x approaching 0+ and x approaching 1-).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, since the problem states the result, it's assumed the integral converges. So maybe the only assumption is that the integral exists. But how to phrase that? The example didn't mention convergence; it listed conditions on n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this problem, there are no explicit assumptions, and the user just needs to structure the problem. But according to the example, even if the original problem doesn't state assumptions, we need to list them. Wait, the original example's problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", so the assumption is n is an integer. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is incorrect. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to list the integral's limits and the form of the integrand as assumptions? But that seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example was flawed, and in reality, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. For the integral problem, the problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions are the conditions under which the integral is defined. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is (x² - 2x + 2 ln(1+x)) / (x³ sqrt(1 - x²)).\n\nBut these are just restatements of the problem. Alternatively, since the integral is improper, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral converges at x = 0,\nThe integral converges at x = 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The problem likely expects the solver to handle the convergence as part of the proof. However, the user's example extracted conditions on the variable, so here, perhaps there are no variable conditions, and the assumptions are about the integral's convergence. But I'm not sure. Given the user's example included conditions that were part of the problem statement (like n being an integer), even if they were given in the problem, perhaps here the assumptions would just restate the integral's limits and the integrand's form. But that seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions section is for any implicit conditions necessary for the problem to make sense. For example, that the integrand is defined on (0,1), which it is except at the endpoints, and the integral is improper there. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval (0, 1),\nThe integrand is defined for all x in (0, 1),\nThe improper integral converges.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure. The user's example seems to list the conditions given in the problem. In the original example, the problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then, the formatted problem also included \"n is divisible by 7\", which might have been a mistake, unless the original problem had that condition. But assuming the example is correct as per the user's instruction, then for the current problem, we need to extract similar assumptions.\n\nBut the current problem doesn't have any variables with conditions; it's a definite integral. So perhaps there are no assumptions other than what's given. But the format requires listing assumptions. Maybe the assumptions here are that the integral is evaluated over [0,1], and the integrand is as given. But that's part of the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are about the existence of the integral. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe improper integral ∫₀¹ [x² - 2x + 2 ln(1+x)] / [x³√(1 - x²)] dx converges.\n\nBut since the problem states the integral equals a specific value, it's implied that it converges. However, in the example, the assumption was about the variable's properties. Here, there's no variable; it's a definite integral. So maybe there are no assumptions, but the format requires something. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are left empty, but the user's example shows two assumptions even when the problem didn't state them. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps the correct approach is to list the components of the problem that are given as conditions. For the integral problem:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is (x² - 2x + 2 ln(1+x)) / (x³√(1 - x²)).\n\nSo these would be the assumptions, each on one line. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is (x² - 2x + 2 ln(1+x)) / (x³√(1 - x²)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals π²/8 - 1/2.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, since there's no variable, just the integral's setup, the assumptions are about the integral's parameters. Therefore, this seems appropriate.",
