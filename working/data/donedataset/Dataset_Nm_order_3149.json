    "Content": "Just based on some reading, I know that every Möbius transformation is a bijection from the Riemann sphere to itself. I'm curious about the converse. For any holomorphic bijection on the sphere, why is it necessarily a Möbius transformation? Is there a proof or reference of why this converse is true? Thanks. (I would appreciate an explanation at the level of someone whose just self-studying complex analysis for the first time.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $f$ is an holomorphic bijection of the sphere to itself. There is a Moebius transformation $g$ which maps $f(\\infty)$ to $\\infty$. Let $h=g\\circ f$, which is again an holomorphic bijective map of the sphere to itself, and which maps $\\infty$ to $\\infty$. It follows that $h(\\mathbb C)\\subseteq\\mathbb C$, because of injectivity, and the restriction $h|_{\\mathbb C}:\\mathbb C\\to\\mathbb C$ is a injective entire function. Now, the big theorem of Picard, or several others, imply that $h|_\\mathbb C$ is necessarily linear. It follows that $h$ itself is linear, and then $f=g^{-1}\\circ h$ is a Moebius transformation.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and format the question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is asking why every holomorphic bijection of the Riemann sphere is necessarily a Möbius transformation. The original problem mentions that Möbius transformations are bijections on the Riemann sphere and now the converse is in question. The user is curious about the proof or reference for this converse, especially at a level suitable for someone self-studying complex analysis for the first time.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The example given in the prompt shows that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem for assumptions. The key elements here are:\n\n1. The function in question is a holomorphic bijection. So, first, the function is holomorphic. Second, it's a bijection. Third, it's defined on the Riemann sphere.\n\nWait, the problem states \"every holomorphic bijection on the sphere\". So the function is a holomorphic bijection from the Riemann sphere to itself. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function is holomorphic (entire, since the Riemann sphere is compact, but maybe need to consider meromorphic? Wait, holomorphic on the entire Riemann sphere, which includes infinity. So in complex analysis, holomorphic functions on the Riemann sphere are actually the rational functions, but since it's a bijection, maybe more restrictions. However, the problem states it's a holomorphic bijection, so perhaps the key assumptions are that the function is holomorphic and bijective on the Riemann sphere. But in complex analysis, when dealing with the Riemann sphere, holomorphic maps are necessarily rational functions. Wait, but the assumption here is that the function is a holomorphic bijection. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. The function f is holomorphic on the Riemann sphere.\n2. The function f is a bijection from the Riemann sphere to itself.\n\nBut the problem is to show that f must be a Möbius transformation. Möbius transformations are functions of the form (az + b)/(cz + d) where ad - bc ≠ 0. So, the conclusion is that any such holomorphic bijection is of that form.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are that the function is holomorphic on the entire Riemann sphere and it's a bijection. The problem is to prove it's a Möbius transformation.\n\nBut maybe there's more. For instance, the Riemann sphere is a compact complex manifold, and holomorphic maps from a compact complex manifold to itself are constant or surjective. But since it's a bijection, it's invertible, so it's an automorphism. The automorphism group of the Riemann sphere is indeed the Möbius transformations. But perhaps the key assumptions needed here are:\n\n1. f: Riemann sphere → Riemann sphere is holomorphic.\n2. f is a bijection.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to show f is a Möbius transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that the function is holomorphic on the entire Riemann sphere, including at infinity. So in complex analysis terms, being holomorphic on the Riemann sphere implies that it's a rational function (since the only holomorphic functions on the Riemann sphere are the rational functions, as they can have poles at finite points but must be holomorphic everywhere else, but at infinity, the behavior is controlled). However, if the function is a bijection, then it must have degree 1 as a rational function, which would make it a Möbius transformation. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere to itself.\n2. f is a bijection.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, f is a Möbius transformation.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, each applies to one object. So the two assumptions here are the function being holomorphic on the Riemann sphere and being a bijection. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these two assumptions and then the problem statement.",
