    "AcceptedAnswer": "I dont see why this proof is enough, this only says $y-x \\in Ker f$ It says much more, since you have the symbol\n$$\n\\iff\n$$ meaning that each side implies the other side . Note that $Ker f=\\{0\\}$ allows one to conclude.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about proving that a linear map is injective if and only if its kernel is {0}. They mentioned their professor's proof: f(x) = f(y) iff f(y - x) = 0 iff y - x ∈ Ker f. But they're confused why this is sufficient.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. Injective means that if f(x) = f(y), then x = y. So, if the function maps distinct elements to distinct elements. The kernel of a linear map is all vectors that map to zero. So Ker f = {x | f(x) = 0}.\n\nThe professor's proof seems to be starting with f(x) = f(y). Then subtracting, using linearity to get f(y - x) = 0. That implies y - x is in the kernel. Now, if the kernel is only {0}, then y - x must be 0, so y = x. Therefore, injective. Conversely, if f is injective, then the only solution to f(x) = 0 is x = 0, so kernel is {0}.\n\nWait, but the original problem is to show the equivalence: f is injective ⇨ Ker f = {0} and vice versa. The user is confused why the given proof is enough. Maybe they think the professor's proof only shows one direction? Let me check.\n\nThe professor's chain is f(x) = f(y) ⇨ f(y - x) = 0 ⇨ y - x ∈ Ker f. So, if Ker f is {0}, then y - x = 0, hence x = y, proving injective. Conversely, if f is injective, suppose there is some non-zero element in Ker f. Then f(z) = 0 for z ≠ 0. Then f(z) = f(0), but since z ≠ 0, this would contradict injectivity. Hence Ker f must be {0}.\n\nSo the professor's proof seems to cover both directions. But maybe the user is missing the converse part? The problem states \"if and only if\", so both directions are needed. The given proof shows that if Ker f is {0}, then f is injective. But does it also show the reverse? The user's question seems to think the proof only shows one direction.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Showing a linear map is injective if and only if kernel is {0}\". The user's question is about their professor's proof. The professor's proof starts with f(x) = f(y) and shows that this leads to y - x being in the kernel. So if the kernel is only {0}, then x = y, hence injective. That's one direction: Ker f = {0} implies injective. What about the converse? If f is injective, then Ker f = {0}. The professor's proof might not have explicitly stated this part, which is maybe why the user is confused.\n\nSo, to structure the problem properly, the assumptions would be about the linear map f, and the conditions for injectivity and kernel. The problem is to show the equivalence. But in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, in the problem here, the only assumption is that f is a linear map. So, in the formatted problem, the assumption would be that f is a linear map. The problem is to show f is injective if and only if Ker f = {0}.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user structured the problem with the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem, the key assumptions are that f is a linear map. Then the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nBut in the original example, the user's formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem statement didn't mention that. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, no, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should not have included that n is divisible by 7. But in their formatted problem, they added that assumption. That might be an error. So perhaps the example is not the best, but the user's task is to structure the problem correctly.\n\nSo, in the current problem, the problem is about linear maps, injectivity, and kernel. The key assumption is that f is a linear map. Then the problem is to show injective if and only if kernel is {0}. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption should list that f is a linear map. But since linearity is part of the problem's premise, that's the main assumption.\n\nBut maybe in the problem, the key properties are that f is linear, and we need to consider injectivity and kernel. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a linear map,\nThe kernel of f is the set containing only the zero vector.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show equivalence between injectivity and kernel being trivial. So perhaps the assumptions should be separated for each direction. But according to the example, the user structured the problem by listing all assumptions of the problem. In the original problem, the only assumption is that f is a linear map, and the problem is to prove injective ⇨ Ker f = {0} and vice versa.\n\nWait, no. The problem as stated in the title is \"Showing a linear map is injective if and only if kernel is {0}\". So the main assumption is that f is a linear map. The problem is to show the equivalence. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption that f is a linear map, and the problem is to prove that f is injective iff Ker f = {0}.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow the instruction to structure the current problem.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nOriginal title and question: \"Showing a linear map is injective if and only if kernel is {0}\". The user's professor's proof is given, but the user is confused.\n\nThe problem requires the assumptions to be listed line by line. The key assumptions here are that f is a linear map. But since the problem is general for any linear map, maybe there are no additional assumptions. Wait, but the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a linear map.\n\nThen the problem is to show that f is injective if and only if the kernel of f is {0}.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added an assumption about n being divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, but perhaps the example was misformatted. Therefore, in this case, the correct assumptions should only be that f is a linear map. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a linear map.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is injective if and only if the kernel of f is {0}.\n\nBut the user's example might have included more assumptions, but I think in this case, the main assumption is linearity. Therefore, the formatted problem should have that assumption.",
