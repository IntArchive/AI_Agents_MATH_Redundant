    "Content": "I am trying to show that $$\\lim {\\left( {\\int\\limits_0^1 {{{dx} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}} } \\right)^n}=\\frac 1 2 $$ Now, this can be done as follows. Using $x\\mapsto x^{-1}$ we get that $$\\int\\limits_0^1 {{{dx} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}}  =\\int\\limits_1^\\infty {{{nx^{n-1}} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}} \\frac{dx}{nx}$$ Upon integrating by parts we get $$\\int\\limits_0^1 {{{dx} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}}  =  - {{\\log 2} \\over n} + \\int\\limits_1^\\infty  {{{\\log \\left( {1 + {x^n}} \\right)} \\over {n{x^2}}}dx} $$ or \n$$\\int\\limits_0^1 {{{dx} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}}  = 1 - {{\\log 2} \\over n} + \\int\\limits_1^\\infty  {{{\\log \\left( {1 + {x^n}} \\right) - n} \\over {n{x^2}}}dx} $$ since $\\int_1^\\infty x^{-2}dx=1$. Using $x\\mapsto x^{-1}$ once again on the RHS, we get $$\\int\\limits_0^1 {{{dx} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}}  = 1 - {{\\log 2} \\over n} + \\int\\limits_0^1 {{{\\log \\left( {1 + {x^n}} \\right) - n\\log x - n} \\over n}dx} $$ But since $\\int_0^1 \\log x=-1=\\int_0^1 dx$ $$\\int\\limits_0^1 {{{dx} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}}  = 1 - {{\\log 2} \\over n} + {1 \\over n}\\int\\limits_0^1 {\\log \\left( {1 + {x^n}} \\right)dx} $$ Now, since for $x\\geq 0$, $\\log(1+x)\\leq x$, we get $$\\int\\limits_0^1 {{{dx} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}}  \\le 1 - {{\\log 2} \\over n} + {1 \\over n}\\int\\limits_0^1 {{x^n}dx}  = 1 - {{\\log 2} \\over n} + {1 \\over {n\\left( {n + 1} \\right)}}$$ which means $$\\int\\limits_0^1 {{{dx} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}}  = 1 - {{\\log 2} \\over n} + O\\left( {{1 \\over {{n^2}}}} \\right)$$ Is this enough to conclude that $${\\left( {\\int\\limits_0^1 {{{dx} \\over {1 + {x^n}}}} } \\right)^n} = {e^{ - \\log 2}} = {1 \\over 2}\\text{ ? }$$ If so, how?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the limit of the integral raised to the nth power is 1/2. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions integrating from 0 to 1, using substitutions like x ↦ x⁻¹, integration by parts, and some bounds using log(1+x) ≤ x. The user is asking if their steps are sufficient to conclude the limit is 1/2.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. In the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions would probably relate to the behavior of the integral as n approaches infinity. The integral is transformed and bounded, leading to an expression involving 1 - (log 2)/n + O(1/n²). When raised to the nth power, they want to know if it approaches e^{-log 2} = 1/2.\n\nSo the assumptions here would include that n is a positive integer approaching infinity, the integral is being approximated with certain terms, and the big O notation is valid for the remainder. Each of these needs to be a separate assumption. Also, the substitution steps and integration by parts are part of the problem-solving process, but perhaps not assumptions. The problem itself is the limit as n approaches infinity of [integral from 0 to 1 of 1/(1+x^n) dx]^n equals 1/2.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user did some manipulations and arrived at an expression. They are asking if their bound is sufficient to conclude the limit. So maybe the assumptions are the steps they took, but the problem is whether that leads to the limit. However, according to the example, assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not the solution steps. So the problem here is to show the limit, and the assumptions would be the conditions under which this limit is evaluated. Since it's a limit as n approaches infinity, perhaps n is a positive integer, and the integral is as defined. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The integral ∫₀¹ dx/(1 + xⁿ) is considered.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the user also performed substitutions and expansions, but those are part of their solution attempt. The actual problem's assumptions are the conditions given in the problem statement. The problem is to prove that the limit is 1/2. The user's question is whether their steps are sufficient, but the formatted problem should present the original problem, not the user's solution steps. So the original problem is to show the limit equals 1/2. The assumptions would include that n is a positive integer approaching infinity, and the integral is over [0,1]. So each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nthe integral is taken over the interval [0, 1],\nthe integrand is 1/(1 + xⁿ),\nthe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, so maybe \"n is a positive integer\" is one assumption, but the limit is part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem changed the original problem's assumptions. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem's example: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems like maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example is correct. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem shouldn't add \"n is divisible by 7\" unless the original problem actually had that. But maybe there was a typo or misrepresentation. Hmm.\n\nBut the user is giving an example of how they want the formatting. So regardless of correctness, the structure is that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for the current problem, the original problem is to show that the limit as n approaches infinity of [integral from 0 to 1 1/(1+x^n) dx]^n = 1/2. So assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The integral ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + xⁿ) dx is considered.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions here are the conditions under which the integral is evaluated and the limit is taken. The problem statement itself doesn't specify any additional constraints on n other than it's a positive integer approaching infinity. However, the user's attempt involved substitutions and expansions, but those are part of their solution steps, not assumptions of the problem. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are just the integral setup and n being a positive integer going to infinity.\n\nBut in the example, they added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example was a different scenario. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original. But maybe the original problem had a typo, or perhaps the example is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nIn any case, the current problem's assumptions should be derived from the problem as presented. The problem is to show the limit equals 1/2. The key elements are n approaching infinity, the integral over [0,1], and the integrand 1/(1+x^n). So assumptions would be:\n\nn is a positive integer,\n\nthe integrand is 1/(1 + x^n),\n\nthe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\n\nthe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So splitting them:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- The integrand is 1/(1 + xⁿ) for x in [0, 1].\n\n- The integral is computed over the interval [0, 1].\n\n- The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut perhaps the key here is that the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the nth power of the integral. So the main assumptions are about the integral and the behavior as n grows. The problem is asking whether the bound derived (1 - log2/n + O(1/n²)) is sufficient to conclude that raising it to the nth power gives 1/2. So maybe the assumptions include the expansion of the integral as 1 - (log2)/n + O(1/n²), but that's part of the user's solution attempt, not the problem's original assumptions. The original problem is just the limit. So perhaps the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a positive integer,\n\nthe integral ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + xⁿ) dx is considered,\n\nthe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( \\int_0^1 \\frac{dx}{1 + x^n} \\right)^n = \\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nBut in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7). However, in the current problem, the original question doesn't have additional assumptions. So perhaps the correct approach is to list the necessary conditions from the problem statement. But since the problem is about a limit, the main assumption is that n approaches infinity, and the integral is as defined. However, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added divisibility by 7, which might be a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to have the problem structured by extracting hidden assumptions. But perhaps the example was incorrect. Given that, I should proceed with the problem as presented. The user's actual question is whether their steps are sufficient, but the task is to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example seems to have modified the original problem's assumptions. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Unless the original problem had a typo and actually required n divisible by 7. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the task is to format the given problem into the specified structure, listing assumptions line by line.\n\nFor the current problem: the original title is \"Sufficient bound to conclude limit has certain value. lim (∫₀¹ dx/(1+xⁿ))ⁿ = 1/2\". The problem is to show that this limit equals 1/2. The assumptions here are the conditions under which this limit is evaluated. The integral is from 0 to 1, the integrand is 1/(1+xⁿ), and n is a positive integer approaching infinity. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a positive integer,\n\nthe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\n\nthe integrand is 1/(1 + xⁿ),\n\nthe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( \\int_0^1 \\frac{dx}{1 + x^n} \\right)^n = \\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property. So splitting:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n\n- The integrand is 1/(1 + xⁿ).\n\n- The limit is evaluated as n approaches infinity.\n\nThat should be the formatted problem.",
