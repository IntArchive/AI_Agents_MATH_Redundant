    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint : $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $[HK:K]$ divides $[G:K]$. Here's a reasonably complete answer, so look away if you don't want that yet: Also $|HK|/|K| = [H:H \\cap K]$ divides $|H|$. Thus $[HK:K]$ divides two relatively prime integers, so divides $1$.\nHence $[H:H \\cap K] = 1$ and $H \\leq K$. You don't really need normality, just that $HK=KH$ is a subgroup ( by the way, whether or not $HK$ is a subgroup, its cardinality is\n$|H| |K|/|H \\cap K|$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the problem states that if H and K are subgroups of a finite group G, at least one of which is normal, and the order of H (|H|) and the index [G:K] are relatively prime, then H must be a subgroup of K. The user also mentioned that when K is normal, they considered the quotient map π: G → G/K and found that π(H) has order dividing both [G:K] and |H|, which are coprime, hence π(H) is trivial, so H ≤ K. But when H is normal instead, they're stuck. Let me try to figure out the case when H is normal.\n\nFirst, let's recall the given conditions:\n\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. H and K are subgroups of G.\n3. Either H or K is normal in G.\n4. gcd(|H|, [G:K]) = 1.\n5. Need to show H ≤ K.\n\nThe user handled the case where K is normal. So now, let's assume H is normal in G. How can we approach this?\n\nSince H is normal, maybe we can use some properties of normal subgroups. Let me think about the product of subgroups. If H is normal, then HK is a subgroup of G, right? Because when one subgroup is normal, the product HK is a subgroup. The order of HK is |H||K| / |H ∩ K|. But maybe we can relate this to the indices somehow.\n\nWait, also, the index [G:K] is equal to |G| / |K|. Since |H| and [G:K] are coprime, that means |H| and |G|/|K| are coprime. So |H| divides |K|? Wait, no, if |H| and |G/K| are coprime, then |H| must divide |K|? Hmm, maybe not directly. Let me check.\n\nLet me denote |G| as the order of G. Then |G| = |K| * [G:K]. Since |H| divides |G| (by Lagrange's theorem), and |H| and [G:K] are coprime, that implies that |H| divides |K|. Because |H| divides |G| = |K| * [G:K], and since |H| and [G:K] share no common factors, |H| must divide |K|. So |H| divides |K|. Therefore, |H| ≤ |K|. But that's just the size. But we need to show that H is a subgroup of K. Hmm.\n\nWait, but even if |H| divides |K|, H might not be a subgroup of K. For example, in S3, the symmetric group, there are subgroups of order 2 and 3. The order 2 divides 3? No, but that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps when H is normal, and |H| divides |K|, then H is a subgroup of K?\n\nWait, but H is normal, so maybe we can use the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem or something related to coprime orders. Alternatively, consider the intersection H ∩ K. If H is normal, then H ∩ K is a normal subgroup of H. Wait, but I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the action of K on H by conjugation. Since H is normal in G, conjugation by any element of G, including elements of K, will map H to itself. Thus, K acts on H by automorphisms. Then, maybe we can use the fact that the orders of K and H are... Wait, but H is normal, so the action is well-defined. But how does that help?\n\nWait, another idea. Since H is normal, consider the subgroup generated by H and K. Since H is normal, HK is a subgroup of G, as mentioned before. The order of HK is |H||K| / |H ∩ K|. But since H is normal, HK is a subgroup. Now, the index [G:K] is equal to |G| / |K|. Also, |HK| divides |G|. Let's compute |HK|. Since |HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K|. But since |H| and [G:K] are coprime, and [G:K] = |G| / |K|, then |H| and |G| / |K| are coprime. Therefore, |H| divides |K|, as before. Wait, but if |H| divides |K|, then |H| ≤ |K|. So HK has order |H||K| / |H ∩ K|. If |H| divides |K|, then |H| / |H ∩ K| must be an integer. Wait, but |H ∩ K| divides |H|. Let me denote d = |H ∩ K|. Then |HK| = |H||K| / d. Since d divides |H|, then |H| / d is an integer. Let's denote |H| = d * m. Then |HK| = d * m * |K| / d = m * |K|. But |H| divides |K|, so |K| = |H| * n / d? Wait, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, consider the quotient group G/H. Since H is normal, G/H is a group. Let's consider the image of K in G/H under the natural projection π: G → G/H. The image π(K) is a subgroup of G/H, and its order is [K : (K ∩ H)] by the isomorphism theorems. But K ∩ H is a subgroup of H, so |K ∩ H| divides |H|. Also, since π(K) is a subgroup of G/H, its order divides |G/H| = |G| / |H|. But [G:K] and |H| are coprime. Let's see.\n\nWe know that |π(K)| = [K : K ∩ H] = |K| / |K ∩ H|. This must divide |G/H| = |G| / |H|. Therefore, |K| / |K ∩ H| divides |G| / |H|. But [G:K] = |G| / |K|. Let me write |G| = [G:K] * |K|. Therefore, |G| / |H| = [G:K] * |K| / |H|. So |K| / |K ∩ H| divides [G:K] * |K| / |H|. Simplifying, |K| / |K ∩ H| divides [G:K] * |K| / |H|. Dividing both sides by |K|, we get 1 / |K ∩ H| divides [G:K] / |H|. But [G:K] and |H| are coprime. Therefore, since 1 / |K ∩ H| must divide [G:K] / |H|, which is an integer only if |H| divides [G:K]. Wait, but [G:K] and |H| are coprime, so |H| must be 1. That can't be right. Maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me try again.\n\nSince π(K) is a subgroup of G/H, its order is |π(K)| = [K : K ∩ H] = |K| / |K ∩ H|. This must divide |G/H| = |G| / |H|. So |K| / |K ∩ H| divides |G| / |H|. But |G| / |K| = [G:K], so |G| / |H| = [G:K] * |K| / |H|. So |K| / |K ∩ H| divides [G:K] * |K| / |H|. Therefore, dividing both sides by |K|, we have 1 / |K ∩ H| divides [G:K] / |H|. But [G:K] and |H| are coprime. Therefore, [G:K]/|H| is actually a fraction in reduced terms. However, the left side is 1 / |K ∩ H|. For this to divide [G:K]/|H|, which is an integer divided by another integer, but since they are coprime, the denominator must be 1. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider the subgroup H. Since H is normal in G, we can look at the intersection H ∩ K. Then, H ∩ K is a subgroup of H, so |H ∩ K| divides |H|. Also, H ∩ K is a subgroup of K, so |H ∩ K| divides |K|. Therefore, |H ∩ K| divides gcd(|H|, |K|). But since |H| and [G:K] are coprime, and [G:K] = |G| / |K|, which implies that |G| = [G:K] * |K|. Since |H| divides |G| (Lagrange), and gcd(|H|, [G:K]) = 1, then |H| divides |K|. Therefore, gcd(|H|, |K|) = |H|, because |H| divides |K|. Therefore, |H ∩ K| divides |H|. But H ∩ K is a subgroup of H, so |H ∩ K| divides |H|. Wait, but this seems trivial. Hmm.\n\nWait, since |H ∩ K| divides both |H| and |K|, and since |H| divides |K|, then |H ∩ K| divides |H|. But we want to show that H ∩ K is H itself, which would imply H ≤ K. So if we can show that |H ∩ K| = |H|, then H ≤ K. How to show that?\n\nSince |H| divides |K|, then |H ∩ K| is a divisor of |H|. Let d = |H ∩ K|. Then d divides |H|. Also, by the second isomorphism theorem, since H is normal, HK / H ≅ K / (H ∩ K). So |HK| = |H| * |K| / d. But HK is a subgroup of G, so |HK| divides |G|. Therefore, |H| * |K| / d divides |G|. But |G| = [G:K] * |K|. So |H| * |K| / d divides [G:K] * |K|. Dividing both sides by |K|, we get |H| / d divides [G:K]. But |H| and [G:K] are coprime. Therefore, |H| / d must divide 1. Hence, |H| / d = 1, so d = |H|. Therefore, |H ∩ K| = |H|, which implies H ∩ K = H, so H ≤ K.\n\nAh, that works! So in the case when H is normal, we consider the subgroup HK, use the second isomorphism theorem to relate its order to |H|, |K|, and their intersection. Then since |H| / d divides [G:K], and they are coprime, |H| / d must be 1, hence d = |H|, so H is contained in K.\n\nSo combining both cases: when K is normal, the user used the quotient group G/K and showed the image of H is trivial. When H is normal, using HK and the isomorphism theorem to show the intersection must have the same order as H, hence H ≤ K. Therefore, the problem is solved.\n\nNow, structuring the original problem according to the required format. The original problem is:\n\n\"Let H and K be subgroups of a finite group G, at least one of which is normal. Show that if |H| and [G:K] are relatively prime, then H ≤ K.\"\n\nThe assumptions here are:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- K is a subgroup of G.\n- At least one of H or K is normal in G.\n- gcd(|H|, [G:K]) = 1.\n\nEach assumption is a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nH is a subgroup of G,\nK is a subgroup of G,\nAt least one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G,\nThe greatest common divisor of |H| and [G:K] is 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that H ≤ K.",
