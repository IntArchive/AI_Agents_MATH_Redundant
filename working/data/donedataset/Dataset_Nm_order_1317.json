    "AcceptedAnswer": "Presumably, you mean the closure of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ under the usual topology. It suffices to show that for every real number $r$ and every $\\epsilon\\gt 0$, there is at least one rational $q$ which is \"$\\epsilon$-close\" to $r$ (that is, $|r-q|\\leq \\epsilon$), since this will show that every open ball around $r$ contains a rational. This shows that the complement of $\\mathbb{Q}$ has empty interior, so the closure of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\\mathbb{R}$. To prove that, let $r$ be a real number, and let $\\epsilon\\gt 0$. Then there exists a natural number $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{10^n}\\lt \\epsilon$. Write $r$ in decimal expansion, and let $q$ be the rational that has the same decimal expansion as $r$ up to the $n$th digit after the decimal point, and terminates there. This is a rational number, since its decimal expansion terminates. Now note that $|r-q|\\leq \\frac{1}{10^n} \\lt \\epsilon$, proving that there is a rational that is $\\epsilon$-close to $r$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking how to prove that the closure of the rational numbers Q is the real numbers R. Hmm, closure in topology usually means the smallest closed set containing the set, right? So the closure of Q should be all the points in R that are limit points of Q. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. The closure of a set S is S union all its limit points. A limit point is a point where every neighborhood around it contains at least one point from S different from itself. Since Q is the set of all rational numbers, and we know that between any two real numbers, there's a rational number. That's the density of Q in R. So every real number should be a limit point of Q because, no matter how small an interval around a real number you take, there's a rational number in there. \n\nWait, does that mean that the closure of Q is R? Because if every real number is a limit point of Q, then the closure would include all of R. And since Q is a subset of R, its closure can't be bigger than R. So combining those two, closure of Q is R.\n\nBut how to structure this as a proof? Let me think. Start by stating that we need to show two inclusions: closure(Q) is a subset of R and R is a subset of closure(Q). The first part is trivial because Q is a subset of R, and R is closed, so closure(Q) must be inside R. The second part requires showing every real number is in the closure of Q. For that, take any real number x and any epsilon > 0, there exists a rational number q such that |q - x| < epsilon. This is possible because Q is dense in R. Therefore, x is a limit point of Q, so x is in closure(Q). Hence, closure(Q) = R.\n\nWait, but the user might not know about density. Maybe I should mention that Q is dense in R, which means its closure is R. But how to prove that Q is dense in R? That usually relies on the definition that between any two real numbers, there's a rational. Which can be proven via the Archimedean property and constructing such a rational. But maybe the problem assumes knowledge of Q being dense. Let me check the original question. The user says \"Can it be proved easily?\" implying they might want a straightforward proof.\n\nSo the steps are: 1. Closure of Q is a closed set containing Q. Since R is closed and contains Q, closure(Q) is a subset of R. 2. Conversely, since Q is dense in R, every real number is a limit point of Q, hence closure(Q) contains all of R. Therefore, closure(Q) = R.\n\nBut to structure this as the problem format, the assumptions. Let's see. The example given had assumptions listed line by line. In the original problem, the user is asking to prove closure of Q is R. The key assumptions here would be about the properties of Q and R in topology. However, maybe the problem is in the context of standard real analysis with the usual topology. So perhaps the assumptions are the standard topology on R, Q is a subset of R with the subspace topology, and the definition of closure as the union of the set and its limit points. But maybe the problem expects the user to use density of Q in R. So the assumptions would include that Q is dense in R. Wait, but is that an assumption or a known property? Since the problem is to prove the closure, perhaps we need to list the necessary properties as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not need additional assumptions beyond the definitions. Wait, in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this problem, maybe the assumptions are that we're working in the real numbers with the standard topology, and Q is the set of rational numbers. But the user hasn't specified any particular conditions. So perhaps the assumptions are just the standard ones. Since the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement, perhaps here the assumptions would be:\n\n- The topological space is R with the standard (Euclidean) topology.\n- The closure operation is taken with respect to this topology.\n- Q is the set of rational numbers.\n\nBut the problem as stated is \"How to prove closure of Q is R?\" So maybe the assumptions are inherent. However, according to the example, the user wants each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe closure is taken in the standard topology on ℝ,\nℚ is a subset of ℝ,\nℝ is a complete metric space,\nℚ is dense in ℝ.\n\nWait, but the density of ℚ in ℝ is something that can be proven, not an assumption. So maybe the problem doesn't require listing that as an assumption. However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might have been part of the problem statement. Wait, looking back at the example: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. So maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the user wants to extract explicit assumptions from the problem statement. But in the case of the closure of Q, the problem statement is straightforward. So perhaps the assumptions are minimal: working in the real numbers with standard topology, and Q is the set of rationals. But how to structure that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes knowledge that Q is dense in R, so that the closure is R. Therefore, the key assumptions would be that Q is dense in R and that the closure of a dense subset in a space is the whole space. But again, these are more like theorems than assumptions.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user just wants the problem restructured without adding new assumptions. So given the problem \"How to prove closure of Q is R\", the formatted version would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe closure is taken in the standard topology on ℝ,\nℚ is the set of rational numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the closure of ℚ is ℝ.\n\nBut the example given included specific mathematical conditions. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't need any assumptions beyond the basic definitions. But since the example had assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement, perhaps here we need to list the necessary conditions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of metric spaces, so the assumption is that ℝ is equipped with the standard metric. But I'm not sure. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to structure the problem as per the user's example, extracting any assumptions from the problem statement. However, the original problem here is very straightforward and doesn't have additional conditions beyond the standard ones. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The topological space under consideration is ℝ with the standard topology.\n- ℚ denotes the set of rational numbers.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were listed even if they were part of the problem. For instance, the original problem was about an integer n, and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\". So similarly here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nℚ is a subset of ℝ,\nThe closure is taken with respect to the standard topology on ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the closure of ℚ is ℝ.\n\nThat seems reasonable. The key here is to ensure that each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So \"ℚ is a subset of ℝ\" and \"closure is taken in standard topology on ℝ\" are two separate assumptions. The problem then is to prove the closure is ℝ.",
