    "Content": "In JIMS 4, p.78, Question 359 was asked by Ramanujan. (See The Problems Submitted by Ramanujan to the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society , p. 9, by Bruce Berndt, et al.) If, $$\\sin(x+y) = 2\\sin\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}(x-y)\\big)\\tag1$$ $$\\sin(y+z) = 2\\sin\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}(y-z)\\big)\\tag2$$ prove that, $$\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sin x\\cos z\\big)^{1/4}+\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cos x\\sin z\\big)^{1/4} =\\big(\\sin 2y)^{1/12}\\tag3$$ The example by Ramanujan was, $$\\begin{aligned}\nx &= \\frac{\\pi-\\arcsin\\big((\\sqrt{5}-2)^3(4+\\sqrt{15})^2\\big)}{2}=1.094\\dots\\\\ \ny &=\\frac{\\arcsin\\big(\\sqrt{5}-2\\big)}{2}=0.119\\dots\\\\\nz &=\\frac{\\arcsin\\big((\\sqrt{5}-2)^3(4-\\sqrt{15})^2\\big)}{2}=0.0001\\dots\n\\end{aligned}$$ Ten years later, a 3-page proof was given in JIMS 15, p.114-117. I got an email asking if there was a shorter proof. Considering the problem, I observed the following. Given the quartic, $$a^3w^4+(1-3a^2)w^3+3a(1-a^2)w^2+a^2(3-a^2)w-a=0\\tag4$$\nwith $a=\\tan(\\color{blue}y/4)$. Define,\n$$x=4\\tan^{-1} u\\\\z=4\\tan^{-1} v$$ \nwhere $u,v$ are two appropriate roots of the quartic, then we get the same bizarre relation as Ramanujan, $$\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sin x\\cos z\\big)^{1/4}+\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cos x\\sin z\\big)^{1/4} =\\big(\\sin 2\\color{blue}y)^{1/12}\\tag5$$ Equivalently, those two roots $u,v$ obey, $$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{4(u-u^3)}{(u^2+1)^2}\\frac{v^4-6v^2+1}{(v^2+1)^2} \\right)^{1/4}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{4(v-v^3)}{(v^2+1)^2}\\frac{u^4-6u^2+1}{(u^2+1)^2} \\right)^{1/4}=\\big(\\sin 2\\color{blue}y\\big)^{1/12}\\tag6$$ For example, let $y=1$, so $a=\\tan(1/4)$, then $u,v$ are the two real roots of (4). Question : Anyone knows a short proof for (3) and (6)?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. The original question is about proving two equations (3) and (6) given some trigonometric equations and a quartic equation. The user wants a short proof for these. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states two initial equations: \n\n1. sin(x + y) = 2 sin((1/2)(x - y))\n2. sin(y + z) = 2 sin((1/2)(y - z))\n\nThese are the starting points. Then, they need to prove equation (3), which is that expression involving sin x, cos z, etc., raised to 1/4 powers, equals (sin 2y)^(1/12). \n\nAdditionally, there's the quartic equation (4) with a = tan(y/4), and x and z defined as 4 arctan u and 4 arctan v, where u and v are roots of the quartic. Then equation (6) is another form to prove. \n\nSo the assumptions here are the two trigonometric equations (1) and (2), and the definitions involving the quartic equation. But wait, in the problem statement, the user asks to prove (3) and (6). However, equation (3) is derived from (1) and (2), while equation (6) is related to the quartic equation and substitutions using u and v. \n\nBut looking at the example given in the user's instruction, they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So here, the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\n1. Equation (1): sin(x + y) = 2 sin((1/2)(x - y))\n2. Equation (2): sin(y + z) = 2 sin((1/2)(y - z))\n3. The quartic equation (4) with a = tan(y/4)\n4. x = 4 arctan u\n5. z = 4 arctan v\n6. u and v are roots of the quartic equation (4)\n\nBut wait, equation (6) is derived from the quartic and the substitutions. The problem asks to prove both (3) and (6). However, (3) is the original problem from Ramanujan, and (6) is an equivalent form based on the quartic roots. \n\nSo perhaps the main problem is to prove (3) given (1) and (2), and to prove (6) given the quartic equation and substitutions. But the user is asking if anyone knows a short proof for both (3) and (6). \n\nBut according to the user's instructions, we need to structure the problem by listing the assumptions and then the problem. The problem here is to prove equations (3) and (6). \n\nHowever, in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, in that example, the user corrected the assumption by adding n divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the assumption might not have stated that. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions include \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. But regardless, we have to follow the user's example.\n\nBut in the problem at hand, the user presents the original question, which involves equations (1) and (2) as given, then asks to prove (3) and (6). So the assumptions would be the given equations (1) and (2), and the definitions related to the quartic equation and substitutions. \n\nBut how to split them into separate lines, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo for equation (3), the assumptions are:\n\n1. $\\sin(x + y) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x - y)\\right)$\n2. $\\sin(y + z) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(y - z)\\right)$\n\nFor equation (6), the assumptions would be:\n\n3. The quartic equation (4): $a^3w^4 + (1 - 3a^2)w^3 + 3a(1 - a^2)w^2 + a^2(3 - a^2)w - a = 0$ where $a = \\tan(y/4)$\n4. $x = 4\\tan^{-1} u$\n5. $z = 4\\tan^{-1} v$\n6. $u$ and $v$ are roots of the quartic equation (4)\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove both (3) and (6) under these assumptions. However, the user might be combining these into one problem. Alternatively, maybe (3) and (6) are two separate results, each under different assumptions. But the user's question is asking for a short proof for both (3) and (6). \n\nLooking back at the original problem statement: \"prove that [equation (3)]\" given equations (1) and (2). Then, \"Equivalently, those two roots u,v obey [equation (6)]\". So equation (6) is equivalent to equation (3) under the substitution via the quartic. So perhaps the problem is to prove equation (3) given (1) and (2), and also prove equation (6) given the quartic setup. \n\nBut the user's exact question is: \"Anyone knows a short proof for (3) and (6)?\" So the problem is to provide a proof for both equations (3) and (6). \n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions and problem:\n\nAssumptions for (3):\n\n1. Equation (1): $\\sin(x + y) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x - y)\\right)$\n2. Equation (2): $\\sin(y + z) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(y - z)\\right)$\n\nProblem (3): Prove that $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin x \\cos z\\right)^{1/4} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos x \\sin z\\right)^{1/4} = (\\sin 2y)^{1/12}$.\n\nAssumptions for (6):\n\n3. $a = \\tan(y/4)$\n4. The quartic equation (4) is satisfied by $w = u$ and $w = v$\n5. $x = 4\\tan^{-1} u$\n6. $z = 4\\tan^{-1} v$\n\nProblem (6): Prove that the expression in (6) holds, which is equivalent to (3).\n\nBut the user wants both (3) and (6) to be proven. However, in the example provided, the user had a single problem with multiple assumptions. Since the user's example had multiple assumptions listed line by line, even if the original problem didn't state them, but maybe inferred from context, perhaps here we need to list all the necessary assumptions for both (3) and (6). But the user may want the problem to be structured as two separate problems? Or combined into one?\n\nBut the original problem is presented as a single problem with two parts. However, the instructions say to structure each problem with assumptions and problem. The example had a single problem. So perhaps here, the problem is split into two parts under one problem statement? Alternatively, maybe the user wants all the assumptions required for both proofs listed, and the problem is to prove both (3) and (6). \n\nBut given the example, where the original problem had a different assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem's statement, but the user included it in the formatted version. Wait, no, in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, we need to follow the user's instruction to list all assumptions from the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, equations (1) and (2) are given, and the problem is to prove (3). Additionally, under the quartic setup, prove (6). But the user is asking for a short proof of both. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are equations (1) and (2), and the definitions related to the quartic and substitutions. \n\nBut how to structure this? Let's read the problem again:\n\n\"In JIMS 4, p.78, Question 359 was asked by Ramanujan. [...] If, \n$$\\sin(x+y) = 2\\sin\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}(x-y)\\big)\\tag1$$ \n$$\\sin(y+z) = 2\\sin\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}(y-z)\\big)\\tag2$$ \nprove that, \n$$\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sin x\\cos z\\big)^{1/4}+\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cos x\\sin z\\big)^{1/4} =\\big(\\sin 2y)^{1/12}\\tag3$$ \n\n[...] Ten years later, a 3-page proof was given [...] I observed the following.

Define, \n$$x=4\\tan^{-1} u\\\\z=4\\tan^{-1} v$$ \nwhere $u,v$ are two appropriate roots of the quartic, then we get the same bizarre relation as Ramanujan, \n$$\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sin x\\cos z\\big)^{1/4}+\\big(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\cos x\\sin z\\big)^{1/4} =\\big(\\sin 2\\color{blue}y)^{1/12}\\tag5$$ \nEquivalently, those two roots $u,v$ obey, \n[...] equation (6) [...] \nQuestion : Anyone knows a short proof for (3) and (6)?\"\n\nSo the user is asking for a proof of (3) given (1) and (2), and also a proof of (6) given the quartic setup. So these are two separate problems, but they are related. However, in the original problem statement, equation (3) is the one to prove from (1) and (2), while equation (6) is an equivalent form under the substitution via the quartic. So perhaps proving (3) is one part, and proving (6) is another part, possibly under different assumptions. \n\nBut the user wants both (3) and (6) to be proven. So perhaps the overall problem is to prove (3) given (1) and (2), and then prove (6) given the quartic equation and substitutions. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions for each part are different. But the user wants to combine them into one structured problem. However, the user's example had a single problem with multiple assumptions. So maybe we list all the necessary assumptions for both parts, and state the problem as proving (3) and (6). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is two separate ones. But since the user's original question is in one post, perhaps we need to list all the assumptions together. \n\nLet me try to list the assumptions for both (3) and (6):\n\nFor (3):\n\n1. $\\sin(x + y) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x - y)\\right)$\n2. $\\sin(y + z) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(y - z)\\right)$\n\nFor (6):\n\n3. $a = \\tan(y/4)$\n4. The quartic equation (4) holds with $a$ as defined\n5. $x = 4\\tan^{-1} u$\n6. $z = 4\\tan^{-1} v$\n7. $u$ and $v$ are roots of the quartic equation (4)\n\nBut the problem is to prove both (3) and (6). However, (3) is under assumptions 1 and 2, and (6) is under assumptions 3-7. But since the user wants them both in the same problem, maybe we need to structure it as two separate problems. However, the user's example only had one problem. \n\nAlternatively, since (6) is equivalent to (3) under the substitutions, maybe the problem is to prove (3) given (1) and (2), and then show the equivalence via the quartic leading to (6). But the user's question is to prove both (3) and (6). \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but to follow the format, perhaps the best approach is to list all assumptions required for both (3) and (6), even if they are separate. But in the original problem statement, the user presents both parts as part of the same problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user considers (3) and (6) as two separate conclusions under different assumptions. So perhaps two separate problems. But since the user's example only includes one problem, maybe here we need to present two separate structured problems. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying one problem. \n\nBut in the original post, the problem is asking for two proofs: one of (3) given (1) and (2), and one of (6) given the quartic setup. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct way is to structure two separate problems. But the user hasn't provided an example of multiple problems. Given the user's example, they only formatted one problem. However, the original problem here is presented as a single post asking for two proofs. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the safest way is to list all assumptions related to both parts and present the problem as proving both (3) and (6) under their respective assumptions. So:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption: \n$\\sin(x + y) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x - y}\\right)$,\n$\\sin(y + z) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(y - z}\\right)$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin x cos z\\right)^{1/4} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}cos x sin z\\right)^{1/4} = (\\sin 2y)^{1/12}$.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\n$a = \\tan(y/4)$,\nQuartic equation (4) is satisfied by $w = u$ and $w = v$,\n$x = 4\\tan^{-1} u$,\n$z = 4\\tan^{-1} v$.\n\nProblem: Prove that [equation (6)] holds.\n\nBut since the user's format requires one problem per instance, but the original question asks for both (3) and (6), maybe we need to combine them. However, the example didn't have multiple problems. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects to list all assumptions necessary for both proofs and present the problem as proving both (3) and (6). But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, since (6) is equivalent to (3) under the given substitutions, perhaps the problem is to prove (3) and then derive (6) from (3) using the quartic and substitutions. So maybe the main problem is to prove (3) given (1) and (2), and then prove (6) as a consequence. \n\nIn the original problem statement, the user mentions that they observed the quartic approach leading to the same relation, so equation (6) is an equivalent form. Therefore, the problem is to prove both (3) and (6), with (3) under assumptions (1) and (2), and (6) under the quartic assumptions.\n\nBut since the user asks for a single structured problem, perhaps we need to combine both sets of assumptions and state the problem as proving both equations. However, the example provided by the user had a single problem with multiple assumptions. Therefore, here's the attempt:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. $\\sin(x + y) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x - y}\\right)$,\n2. $\\sin(y + z) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(y - z}\\right)$,\n3. $a = \\tan(y/4)$,\n4. The quartic equation $a^3w^4 + (1 - 3a^2)w^3 + 3a(1 - a^2)w^2 + a^2(3 - a^2)w - a = 0$ is satisfied by $w = u$ and $w = v$,\n5. $x = 4\\tan^{-1} u$,\n6. $z = 4\\tan^{-1} v$.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin x \\cos z\\right)^{1/4} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos x \\sin z\\right)^{1/4} = (\\sin 2y)^{1/12}$$\nand\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{4(u-u^3)}{(u^2+1)^2}\\frac{v^4-6v^2+1}{(v^2+1)^2} \\right)^{1/4}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{4(v-v^3)}{(v^2+1)^2}\\frac{u^4-6u^2+1}{(u^2+1)^2} \\right)^{1/4}=\\big(\\sin 2y\\big)^{1/12}.$$\n\nBut I think this is combining both problems into one, which might not be accurate. Alternatively, the problem is to prove (3) given (1) and (2), and to prove (6) given the quartic and substitutions. But according to the example, which had multiple assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property, I need to list all assumptions separately.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. $\\sin(x + y) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x - y}\\right)$,\n2. $\\sin(y + z) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(y - z}\\right)$,\n3. $a = \\tan(y/4)$,\n4. $a^3w^4 + (1 - 3a^2)w^3 + 3a(1 - a^2)w^2 + a^2(3 - a^2)w - a = 0$,\n5. $x = 4\\tan^{-1} u$,\n6. $z = 4\\tan^{-1} v$,\n7. $u$ and $v$ are roots of the quartic equation in assumption 4.\n\nProblem: Prove that equations (3) and (6) hold.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the quartic and substitutions are necessary for proving (3), or if (3) is independent. From the original problem statement, (3) is to be proven from (1) and (2), while (6) is a consequence of the quartic substitutions. So they are separate proofs. \n\nBut the user's question is asking for both proofs in one question. Therefore, to follow the user's example, which lists all relevant assumptions and then states the problem, even if the problem has multiple parts, I think the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption: \n$\\sin(x + y) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x - y}\\right)$,\n$\\sin(y + z) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(y - z}\\right)$,\n$a = \\tan(y/4)$,\nQuartic equation $a^3w^4 + (1 - 3a^2)w^3 + 3a(1 - a^2)w^2 + a^2(3 - a^2)w - a = 0$ holds,\n$x = 4\\tan^{-1} u$,\n$z = 4\\tan^{-1} v$,\n$u$ and $v$ are roots of the quartic equation.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin x \\cos z\\right)^{1/4} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos x \\sin z\\right)^{1/4} = (\\sin 2y)^{1/12}$$\nand \n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{4(u-u^3)}{(u^2+1)^2}\\frac{v^4-6v^2+1}{(v^2+1)^2} \\right)^{1/4}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{4(v-v^3)}{(v^2+1)^2}\\frac{u^4-6u^2+1}{(u^2+1)^2} \\right)^{1/4}=\\big(\\sin 2y\\big)^{1/12}.$$\n\nBut this combines both proofs into one problem with all assumptions listed. However, the initial two assumptions (equations 1 and 2) are for proving (3), while the remaining assumptions are for proving (6). Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is to split into two problems. But since the user's example didn't do that, maybe we need to list all assumptions and present both conclusions as the problem. \n\nAlternatively, since the user's example had an original problem that was modified (adding n divisible by 7), perhaps the assistant needs to extract all assumptions from the problem statement, even if they are not explicitly stated. \n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be part of the original problem. This suggests that the user might want to list all necessary assumptions inferred from the problem, even if not explicitly stated. \n\nIn our current problem, the user's original question includes equations (1) and (2) as given, and the problem is to prove (3) and (6). The assumptions for (3) are (1) and (2), and the assumptions for (6) involve the quartic and substitutions. Therefore, perhaps the correct formatted problem is two separate problems. However, the user's instructions say to structure \"that problem\" (singular) into the given format. The example also structures one problem. Therefore, perhaps the user wants each problem instance to be formatted separately. However, the original question here is one post asking two proofs. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and following the user's example, which formatted one problem, even though the original problem might have multiple parts, I think the assistant should list all assumptions and state the problem as proving both (3) and (6). Therefore:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$\\sin(x + y) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x - y)\\right)$,\n$\\sin(y + z) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(y - z)\\right)$,\n$a = \\tan\\left(\\frac{y}{4}\\right)$,\n$a^3w^4 + (1 - 3a^2)w^3 + 3a(1 - a^2)w^2 + a^2(3 - a^2)w - a = 0$,\n$x = 4\\tan^{-1} u$,\n$z = 4\\tan^{-1} v$,\n$u$ and $v$ are roots of the quartic equation.\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin x \\cos z\\right)^{1/4} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos x \\sin z\\right)^{1/4} = (\\sin 2y)^{1/12}$$\nand\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{4(u-u^3)}{(u^2+1)^2}\\frac{v^4-6v^2+1}{(v^2+1)^2} \\right)^{1/4}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{4(v-v^3)}{(v^2+1)^2}\\frac{u^4-6u^2+1}{(u^2+1)^2} \\right)^{1/4} = (\\sin 2y)^{1/12}.$$",
