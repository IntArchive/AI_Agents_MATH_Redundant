    "Content": "Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. Prove that: If $a^2$ divides $b^2$, then $a$ divides $b$. Context: the lecturer wrote this up in my notes without proving it, but I can't seem to figure out why it's true. Would appreciate a solution.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By the fundamental theorem of arithemtic, you can write $a$ and $b$ as a product of primes, say\n$$\na=p_1^{\\alpha_1}\\cdots p_r^{\\alpha_r},\\qquad b=p_1^{\\beta_1}\\cdots p_r^{\\beta_r}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_i,\\beta_i\\geq 0$. Allow the exponents to possibly be $0$ if such a prime $p_i$ occurs in the factorization of one integer but not the other. So $a^2=p_1^{2\\alpha_1}\\cdots p_r^{2\\alpha_r}$ and $b^2=p_1^{2\\beta_1}\\cdots p_r^{2\\beta_r}$. Since $a^2\\mid b^2$, by unique factorization, necessarily $2\\alpha_i\\leq 2\\beta_i$ for each $i$. That implies $\\alpha_i\\leq\\beta_i$ for all $i$, and so $a\\mid b$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem: If \\( a^2 \\) divides \\( b^2 \\), then \\( a \\) divides \\( b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers. Hmm, the user wants a proof of this statement. First, I need to recall some number theory concepts. \n\nSo, the key here is probably related to prime factorizations. Since we're dealing with divisibility, breaking down into primes might help. Let me think. If \\( a^2 \\) divides \\( b^2 \\), then all the primes in \\( a^2 \\) must be present in \\( b^2 \\) with at least the same exponents. \n\nLet's write the prime factorization of \\( a \\) as \\( a = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dots p_k^{e_k} \\). Then \\( a^2 = p_1^{2e_1} p_2^{2e_2} \\dots p_k^{2e_k} \\). Similarly, \\( b \\) can be written as \\( b = p_1^{f_1} p_2^{f_2} \\dots p_k^{f_k} \\dots \\) (maybe with more primes), so \\( b^2 = p_1^{2f_1} p_2^{2f_2} \\dots \\). \n\nSince \\( a^2 \\) divides \\( b^2 \\), for each prime \\( p_i \\) in \\( a \\), we have \\( 2e_i \\leq 2f_i \\), which simplifies to \\( e_i \\leq f_i \\). Therefore, each exponent in \\( a \\)'s prime factorization is less than or equal to that in \\( b \\)'s. Hence, \\( a \\) divides \\( b \\).\n\nWait, is that all? Maybe I should check if there are any edge cases. Suppose \\( a \\) has a prime factor not in \\( b \\). Then \\( a^2 \\) would have that prime squared, but \\( b^2 \\) wouldn't have it, so \\( a^2 \\) couldn't divide \\( b^2 \\). Therefore, all primes in \\( a \\) must be in \\( b \\), and their exponents in \\( a \\) are at most those in \\( b \\). So yes, that shows \\( a \\) divides \\( b \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of the greatest common divisor. Let \\( d = \\gcd(a,b) \\), so \\( a = d \\cdot m \\) and \\( b = d \\cdot n \\), where \\( \\gcd(m,n) = 1 \\). Then \\( a^2 = d^2 m^2 \\), \\( b^2 = d^2 n^2 \\). If \\( a^2 \\) divides \\( b^2 \\), then \\( d^2 m^2 \\) divides \\( d^2 n^2 \\), which implies \\( m^2 \\) divides \\( n^2 \\). Since \\( \\gcd(m,n) = 1 \\), \\( m^2 \\) must be 1, hence \\( m = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( a = d \\cdot 1 = d \\), which divides \\( b = d \\cdot n \\). \n\nThat's another approach. Both methods seem valid. Maybe the first one is more straightforward with prime factorizations. \n\nSo the main idea is that the exponents in the prime factors of \\( a \\) must be less than or equal to those in \\( b \\) when \\( a^2 \\) divides \\( b^2 \\), hence \\( a \\) divides \\( b \\). \n\nI should present this step-by-step in the answer. Also, make sure to mention that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, which is given. No other assumptions needed since the problem states \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers. Wait, the original problem didn't specify any other conditions, so the assumptions are just that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers and \\( a^2 \\) divides \\( b^2 \\). The problem is to prove \\( a \\) divides \\( b \\).",
