    "Content": "If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, $f(x)≥0$ on $[a,b]$ and $$\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) =0$$ then prove that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$. I tried with Riemann's definite integral definition but couldn't proceed",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint : Suppose that $f$ were not identically zero, and choose $x_0 \\in (a, b)$ for which $f(x_0) > 0$. Then there exists an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $$|x - x_0| < \\epsilon \\implies f(x) > \\frac{1}{2} f(x_0)$$ Try considering a partition of the interval containing the interval $[x_0 - \\epsilon, x_0 + \\epsilon]$, and compute a lower sum.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, with each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then state the problem concisely.\n\nThe original problem from Math Stack Exchange is about proving that if a continuous, non-negative function on [a, b] has an integral equal to zero, then the function must be identically zero on that interval. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem and extract the assumptions. The function f is continuous on [a, b], which is one assumption. Then, f(x) is non-negative (≥0) on [a, b], another assumption. The integral of f from a to b is zero. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions section. \n\nWait, the original problem's title mentions the integral being zero and the function being continuous and non-negative. The user's example had two assumptions for n: being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, each property of f should be a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption 1: f is continuous on [a, b].\nAssumption 2: f(x) ≥ 0 for all x in [a, b].\nAssumption 3: The integral of f from a to b is zero.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that f(x) = 0 for all x in [a, b].\n\nI should check if there's any hidden assumption. The problem states all three conditions: continuity, non-negativity, and integral zero. Each is a separate condition on f. So the formatted problem should list each of these as separate assumptions. The example given by the user shows that even if the original problem mentions multiple properties in a single sentence, each is split into separate lines. For instance, in the example, the original problem mentions \"for every integer n\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. Similarly here, each property of f should be its own line. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nf is continuous on [a,b],\nf(x) ≥ 0 for all x in [a,b],\nthe integral of f from a to b is 0.\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ [a,b].",
