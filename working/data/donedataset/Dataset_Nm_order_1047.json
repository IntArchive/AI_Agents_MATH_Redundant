    "Content": "This question is about generic group theory problems. here are examples for what I’m referring to: Prove that any group of order $p^2$ , where $p$ is a prime, is\n  abelian. Let $G$ be a group of order $2n$ . Suppose that half of the elements\n  of $G$ are order $2$ , and the other half form a subgroup $H$ of order $n$ . Prove that $H$ is of odd order ( $n$ is odd) and that it's\n  abelian. \"Let $G$ be a group with $|G|=pq$ for some $p$ , $q$ primes such that $p>q,q∤p−1$ . Prove $G$ is cyclic.\" Most of the time I find myself attacking these kind of problems with no coherent strategy, just throwing all my ammunition (Cauchy theorem, Lagrange theorem, index 2 theorem, intersection unions and multiplication of (normal-) subgroups etc.). Best case scenario is I manage to prove the statement yet I don't quite get why the statement is true because the proof is so long and involves a lot of cases and assumptions by contradiction that i can't see the forest for the trees. A lot of the times there are more than one way to prove the statement which are not so similar. For an excellent example to what I’m referring to, look here . Since I feel that most of the time I’m just juggling variables I'd like to know what should i do to understand what's really going on? Another different thing that might ease my mind is an exhaustive list of the theorems that can be used to solve these kind of problems . That way i will at least know what are all the possible techniques that might work for these problems. ADDED: Although neat proofs for the specific problems i posted are welcome they are not the reason i asked this question. I solved these problems and others too yet my proofs were long and lacked an identifiable idea . What I'm looking for is a general principle that could guide me in constructing proofs for these problems.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I find that, for elementary group theory problems, one of the best places to start is by asking yourself if (how) groups actions could be used to express this. Then you have some very powerful (while still elementary) theorems that you can use. For your examples, I point you to User-33433's answer. For another example which was found in a homework problem in the abstract algebra class that I just finished: Show that any group (including infinite) that contains a proper subgroup of finite index also contains a proper normal subgroup of finite index. One way to prove it is to go through all of the motions of proving that the intersection of finite index subsets is, again, finite index, extending this by induction, looking at $N=\\bigcap_{g\\in G}gHg^{-1}$,  proving that this normal and is actually a finite intersection by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem when $G$ acts on the cosets of $H$ by conjugation, and finally using the result on finite intersections of finite index sets that you would have proved. The easier, and more powerful, way to show this result (and even more, as we'll see) is the following which comes from considering the action of $G$ on the cosets of $H$ by conjugation as the important feature, rather than just a means to show that the previous set $N$ is a finite intersection. Let $H\\leq G$ be of finite index $n$. Then, $G$ acts on the cosets of $H$ by conjugation, and this induces a map $\\varphi:G\\to\\text{Sym}\\left(G/H\\right)\\cong S_{n}$. The kernel of this map is normal, and $G/\\ker\\varphi$ isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_{n}$, so $|G:\\ker\\varphi|\\leq n!$, as required. This proves that, not only do we have a proper normal subgroup of finite index, but we have one of index $\\leq n!$. So, group actions are very powerful and allow you to go straight to the core of many elementary group theory problems, rather than having you flounder around for a bunch of other results just to scratch the surface.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example given shows that the original problem might have extra information that needs to be filtered out, and the assumptions and problem should be clearly separated.\n\nLooking at the provided example, the original problem mentions divisibility by 91, and the assumptions include that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user stated \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't specify that. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Or perhaps the example was modified to show how to structure? Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nThe current Math Stack Exchange question is about generic group theory problems. The user is asking for a way to structure these problems into the given format. The actual problem examples provided are three different group theory questions. The user wants to extract the assumptions and the problem statement for each of them.\n\nFirst example: Prove that any group of order p², where p is a prime, is abelian.\n\nAssumptions here would be: G is a group, |G| = p², p is a prime. Then the problem is to prove G is abelian.\n\nSecond example: Let G be a group of order 2n. Suppose that half of the elements of G are order 2, and the other half form a subgroup H of order n. Prove that H is of odd order (n is odd) and that it's abelian.\n\nAssumptions: G is a group, |G| = 2n, half of G's elements have order 2, the other half form a subgroup H of order n. The problem is to prove H has odd order (n odd) and H is abelian.\n\nThird example: Let G be a group with |G|=pq for some primes p, q such that p>q, q does not divide p−1. Prove G is cyclic.\n\nAssumptions: G is a group, |G|=pq, p and q are primes, p > q, q does not divide p−1. Problem: Prove G is cyclic.\n\nHowever, the user isn't asking for these specific problems to be solved but is asking for a general principle to approach such group theory problems. But the task here is to structure the problem as per the format given. Wait, the original question on Math Stack Exchange is a meta-question about strategies for solving group theory problems, not a specific math problem. However, within the question, the user provides three example problems. The user (the one giving me instructions) wants me to format these examples into the Assumption and Problem structure, similar to the example they provided.\n\nBut looking at the original problem in the example, they had to filter out some information. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had a mistake. Wait, maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. Anyway, proceeding.\n\nSo for each of the three group theory examples given in the question, I need to extract the assumptions and problem.\n\nFirst example:\n\nOriginal statement: Prove that any group of order p², where p is a prime, is abelian.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- G is a group.\n\n- The order of G is p².\n\n- p is a prime.\n\nProblem: Prove G is abelian.\n\nSecond example:\n\nOriginal statement: Let G be a group of order 2n. Suppose that half of the elements of G are order 2, and the other half form a subgroup H of order n. Prove that H is of odd order (n is odd) and that it's abelian.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- G is a group.\n\n- The order of G is 2n.\n\n- Half of the elements of G have order 2.\n\n- The other half of the elements form a subgroup H of G.\n\n- The order of H is n.\n\nProblem: Prove that H has odd order (n is odd) and H is abelian.\n\nThird example:\n\nOriginal statement: Let G be a group with |G|=pq for some p, q primes such that p>q, q∤p−1. Prove G is cyclic.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- G is a group.\n\n- The order of G is pq.\n\n- p and q are primes.\n\n- p > q.\n\n- q does not divide p−1.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is cyclic.\n\nSo each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. For example, in the first problem, each line is about G's properties: being a group, its order, p being prime. Similarly, in the third problem, each condition is separated.\n\nNow, the user's question on Math Stack Exchange is not a math problem per se but a request for strategies. However, the examples within that question are actual problems. The user (the one giving me instructions) wants me to structure those examples into the Assumption and Problem format, as per the example. The actual main question (about strategies) isn't a math problem to solve, but the examples within it are. So the task is to process those three examples given in the question.\n\nSo I need to present each of the three examples in the specified format. However, the user's example only formatted one problem. The instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\" which suggests per problem. So maybe each example in the question should be formatted separately. However, the user's original instruction says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps the entire post is considered a single problem, but the examples within it are multiple problems. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, looking back, the user says: \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" Then the example shows that they took the original problem, which had some extra text, and formatted it into Assumption and Problem. The original problem in the example was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem includes assumptions about n being integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. So maybe there's a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then there's no assumption that n is divisible by 7. Unless there's a typo, but perhaps the example is wrong. Anyway, perhaps the user intended that in the example, they considered that the problem actually requires n to be divisible by 7, but that's not clear. Maybe the original problem had a typo. Anyway, proceeding.\n\nIn the current problem, the Math Stack Exchange question is asking about strategies for group theory problems and gives three examples. The task is to structure those examples into the Assumption and Problem format. So each example is a separate problem to be formatted.\n\nTherefore, the answer should have three formatted problems, each corresponding to the examples given in the question.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the formatted problem has Assumption and Problem sections. So each of the three examples needs to be structured similarly.\n\nFirst formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- G is a group,\n\n- The order of G is p²,\n\n- p is a prime.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that G is abelian.\n\nSecond formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- G is a group,\n\n- The order of G is 2n,\n\n- Half of the elements of G have order 2,\n\n- The other half of the elements form a subgroup H of G,\n\n- The order of H is n.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that H has odd order and is abelian.\n\nThird formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- G is a group,\n\n- The order of G is pq,\n\n- p and q are primes,\n\n- p > q,\n\n- q does not divide p−1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that G is cyclic.\n\nEach of these is a separate problem, so the answer should present each in the specified format. However, the user's original example only had one problem. But since the question contains three examples, perhaps each should be formatted as separate entries.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem is handled individually. So the answer should have three separate formatted problems. However, the user's example only shows one. But given the context, perhaps the user expects all three examples to be formatted.\n\nHowever, the user's original question on Math Stack Exchange is not a problem to solve but a request for strategies. But the user (the person giving me instructions) wants me to extract the three problems mentioned in the question and format each of them. So the answer should be three formatted problems as per the examples.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should have three sections, each with Assumption and Problem, corresponding to the three examples in the original question.",
