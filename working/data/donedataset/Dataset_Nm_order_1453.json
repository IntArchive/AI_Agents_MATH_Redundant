    "AcceptedAnswer": "Alternatively, integration by parts works immediately. Let $$a_n=\\int_0^\\infty x^{2n}e^{-x^2}.$$  Consider $U=x^{2n-1}$ so that $du=(2n-1)x^{2n-2}$, and $dv=xe^{-x^{2}}$ so that $V=-\\frac{1}{2}e^{-x^{2}}$. Then\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty}x^{2n}e^{-x^{2}}dx=\\frac{1}{2}e^{-x^{2}}x^{2n-1}\\biggr|_{0}^{\\infty}-\\int_{0}^{\\infty}(2n-1)x^{2n-2}\\frac{-1}{2}e^{-x^{2}}dx$$ \n$$=\\frac{(2n-1)}{2}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}x^{2n-2}e^{-x^{2}}dx=\\frac{(2n-1)2n}{2^{2}n}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}x^{2n-2}e^{-x^{2}}dx$$ Hence $$a_n=\\frac{(2n)(2n-1)}{2^2n}a_{n-1}$$ and since $a_0=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$ we conclude $$a_n=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}x^{2n}e^{-x^{2}}dx=\\frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}n!}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$$ by induction.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let's look at the original question. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of x^(2n) times e^(-x²) dx equals (2n)!/(2^(2n) n!)) * sqrt(pi)/2, without using the gamma function.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem.\n\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity, so the limits are fixed. The integrand is x^(2n) e^(-x²). The variable of integration is x, and n is presumably a non-negative integer since it's a common context for such integrals, especially involving factorials. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state any restrictions on n. Wait, the problem just says \"without gamma function\"—maybe they want to use induction or another method.\n\nBut the assumptions should be based on the problem's given information. The problem statement is to prove the equality. So the assumptions would include that the integral is over [0, ∞), the integrand is x^{2n} e^{-x²}, and perhaps that n is a non-negative integer, even though not stated. But the original problem didn't specify any conditions on n, so maybe that's an implicit assumption. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the integral's form. Wait, the example given in the problem had assumptions like n is an integer and divisible by 7. So here, maybe n is a non-negative integer. That makes sense because factorial and (2n)! would require n to be an integer. Also, the original problem doesn't mention any restrictions, but in mathematical contexts, such integrals for general n might require n to be a non-negative integer unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The integral is evaluated from 0 to infinity.\n2. The integrand is x^{2n} multiplied by e^{-x²}.\n3. n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut wait, does the problem state that n is an integer? The original question just says \"without gamma function\". The user wrote \"Please show ∫₀^∞ x^{2n} e^{-x²} dx=...\". The variable n here is typically an integer in such formulas, especially since the answer involves factorial expressions. So it's safe to assume n is a non-negative integer. However, in the example provided earlier, the user included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. The example had the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's setup. Wait, the original example had \"for every integer n\" but then the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like maybe the user adjusted the assumptions beyond the problem's explicit statements. Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. Formatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Because if the original problem says for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't add that n is divisible by 7 unless the original problem had that condition. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Because the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example had a typo. Or perhaps the original problem was different. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, in the current problem, the user's example shows that assumptions are conditions that are part of the problem, even if they are stated in the problem. So for the current problem, the assumptions should include that n is a non-negative integer because the answer involves factorial terms, which are defined for non-negative integers. The problem statement might not specify this, but it's an implicit assumption necessary for the expression to make sense. So I'll list that as an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The integral is taken over the interval from 0 to ∞.\n2. The integrand is x^{2n} e^{-x²}.\n3. n is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe problem is to prove the equality as given. So structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to infinity,\nThe integrand is x^{2n} multiplied by e^{-x²},\nn is a non-negative integer.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty x^{2n} e^{-x^2}\\mathrm dx=\\frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}n!}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$$.\n\nI should check if there are any other assumptions. For example, maybe the problem assumes knowledge of Gaussian integrals, but those aren't part of the problem's explicit assumptions. The user just wants the proof without using the gamma function. However, the instructions say to list the assumptions of the problem, not the solution methods. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not the methods to solve it. The fact that the gamma function isn't to be used is part of the problem's constraints but not an assumption about the variables or functions involved. Therefore, \"without gamma function\" is a constraint on the solution method, not an assumption of the problem's conditions. Hence, it's part of the problem statement but not listed as an assumption. So in the formatted problem, the problem line should include \"without using the gamma function\".\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Please show ∫₀^∞ x^{2n} e^{-x²}dx=... without gamma function?\" So the problem is to prove the equality without using the gamma function. Therefore, the problem statement should include that constraint. However, in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem included the divisibility by 91, but the original problem had \"for every integer n\". The example's formatted problem didn't include \"for every integer n\" in the problem line, but listed it as an assumption. So in this case, the user's example suggests that constraints on variables (like n being an integer) are listed as assumptions, and the problem line is the main statement to prove.\n\nSo applying that here, the problem line should be: \"Prove that [integral] equals [expression] without using the gamma function.\" But in the example, the problem line didn't include the \"for every integer n\" part, but the assumption listed \"n is an integer\". So here, similarly, the problem line would be \"Prove that [integral equals expression] without using the gamma function.\" And the assumptions would include that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title includes \"without gamma function\", but the actual question in the body just says \"Prove: [integral equals expression] Thanks!\". So maybe the \"without gamma function\" is part of the problem's requirement. So to structure it correctly, the problem line should include the \"without gamma function\" as part of the problem statement.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to infinity,\nThe integrand is x^{2n} multiplied by e^{-x²},\nn is a non-negative integer.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty x^{2n} e^{-x^2}\\mathrm dx=\\frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}n!}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$$ without using the gamma function.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The \"without gamma function\" is part of the problem's requirement, so it's included in the problem statement. The assumptions are the conditions on the integral and n.",
