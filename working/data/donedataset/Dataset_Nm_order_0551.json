    "Content": "In the definition of a ring $R$, one has $a(b+c) = ab + ac$ and $(a+b)c = ac + bc$ for all $a,b,c\\in R$ My question is (just out of curiosity) if one really needs both of these. I can't think of an example of something that is not a ring that only satisfies one of the sides of the distributive law. So can one prove that if $a(b+c) = ab + ac$ for all $a,b,c$, then $(a+b)c = ac + bc$ for all $a,b,c$. Edit: I maybe should add that all rings in my definition have a unity $1$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an example that fails precisely in left distributivity. Consider $\\mathbb{R}[X]$ - the polynomials with coefficients from $\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual operation of pointwise addition (in fact, the ring of scalars is irrelevant here). The tricky part is how we define multiplication: let $p \\cdot q$ be the composition $p \\circ q$. This multiplication is associative, and even has an identity, which is the identity polynomial $p(x)=x$. Now, trivially $$(p_1 + p_2) \\circ q = p_1 \\circ q + p_2 \\circ q,$$ but in general $$p \\circ (q_1 + q_2) \\color{red} \\neq p \\circ q_1 + p \\circ q_2.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking if in the definition of a ring, both distributive laws (left and right distributivity) are necessary, or if one can be derived from the other. Specifically, they want to know if assuming only left distributivity (a(b + c) = ab + ac for all a, b, c) is enough to prove right distributivity ((a + b)c = ac + bc for all a, b, c), especially in rings that have a unity element. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of a ring. A ring is a set R equipped with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, such that (R, +) is an abelian group, multiplication is associative, and the distributive laws hold: left distributivity (a(b + c) = ab + ac) and right distributivity ((a + b)c = ac + bc). The question is whether these two distributive laws are independent axioms or if one implies the other when there's a unity present.\n\nThe user mentions that their definition of a ring includes a multiplicative identity (unity). So we have to consider if the presence of 1 affects the relationship between the two distributive laws. \n\nMy initial thought is that left and right distributivity are independent in general algebraic structures. However, maybe the existence of a unity allows one to derive one distributive law from the other. Let me check this.\n\nSuppose we have a ring R with unity 1, and suppose that left distributivity holds: a(b + c) = ab + ac for all a, b, c in R. We need to see if right distributivity must follow. Let's take arbitrary elements a, b, c in R and consider (a + b)c. We need to show this equals ac + bc.\n\nBut how can we relate this to left distributivity? If we can express (a + b)c in terms that use left distributivity, maybe by using the unity. For example, consider multiplying on the left by 1. Wait, that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that multiplication is associative? Wait, no, multiplication in a ring isn't necessarily associative unless it's specifically a non-associative ring, but standard rings are associative. Wait, no, in a general ring, multiplication is associative. Wait, actually, rings are defined with associative multiplication. So associativity is given. Hmm.\n\nWait, but how can associativity help here? Let me think. Let's try to write (a + b)c in terms of left distributivity. Since left distributivity is about multiplying from the left, maybe we can use the unity element. For instance, consider that (a + b)c = 1*(a + b)c. But since multiplication is associative, this is (1*(a + b))c. Wait, but 1*(a + b) is just (a + b), so that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe express (a + b)c as (a + b)(1*c). But then, using left distributivity on (a + b) multiplied by (1*c + 1*c?), no, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that in a ring with unity, we can use additive inverses and properties of the additive group. Let's consider the additive group being abelian, so addition is commutative. So (a + b) = (b + a), but how does that help?\n\nWait, maybe using the right distributive law in reverse. Suppose we assume only left distributivity. Let me take specific elements. Let’s pick arbitrary elements x, y, z in R. We need to show (x + y)z = xz + yz.\n\nIf I can write this as some left distributive expression. Let me think. Let’s denote d = x + y. Then dz = (x + y)z. But how to relate this to left distributivity? Left distributivity is when you have a multiplied by (b + c). Here, we have (a + b) multiplied by c. So the positions are different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the unity element. Let's think of z as 1*z. Then (x + y)z = (x + y)(1*z). But since multiplication is associative, this is [(x + y)*1]*z. But (x + y)*1 is x + y, so again, that doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe if we can express z as a sum involving 1. For example, z = 1*z. But again, not sure. Alternatively, consider that in a ring with unity, every element can be written as a product involving 1? Not necessarily. For example, in a ring with unity, not every element is a multiple of 1 unless it's a ring where 1 generates the entire ring under addition, which isn't necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that addition is commutative and try to flip the terms. For example, (a + b)c = c(a + b) if multiplication were commutative, but rings don't require multiplication to be commutative. So that might not hold.\n\nWait, but even if multiplication isn't commutative, maybe we can relate left and right distributivity through the unity. Let me try to compute (a + b)c. Let's consider that 1*(a + b)c. Using left distributivity, 1*(a + b)c = (1*a + 1*b)c = (a + b)c. Wait, that's just restating the same thing. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe write (a + b)c as c*(a + b) if we can switch the order, but again, unless multiplication is commutative, which it isn't necessarily. So that might not be valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use additive inverses. Let me think. The additive group is abelian, so we have inverses. Suppose we take (a + b)c - ac - bc. If we can show this is zero, then right distributivity holds. But how to show this using left distributivity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand some expression using left distributivity and compare. For example, consider (a + b)(c + d) for some d. Using left distributivity, (a + b)(c + d) = a(c + d) + b(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. On the other hand, if we expand it as (a + b)c + (a + b)d, which would be equal to ac + bc + ad + bd. If we equate these two expressions, we get that (a + b)c + (a + b)d = a(c + d) + b(c + d). But without right distributivity, we can't say that (a + b)c = ac + bc. So this approach might not help.\n\nWait, but maybe if we set d to be specific elements, like zero. Let's try d = 0. Then (a + b)(c + 0) = (a + b)c. Using left distributivity, this is a(c) + b(c). But also, (a + b)c + (a + b)0 = ac + bc + 0 = ac + bc. So comparing, (a + b)c = ac + bc. Wait, does this work?\n\nWait, let's see. If we take (a + b)(c + 0) = a(c + 0) + b(c + 0) = ac + a0 + bc + b0. But since a0 = 0 and b0 = 0 (because in a ring, multiplying by zero gives zero), this becomes ac + 0 + bc + 0 = ac + bc. On the other hand, (a + b)c + (a + b)0 = (a + b)c + 0 = (a + b)c. Therefore, equating the two expressions, we have (a + b)c = ac + bc. So does this mean that right distributivity follows from left distributivity?\n\nBut wait, this seems too good. If this is the case, then why do rings require both distributive laws? Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check this step-by-step.\n\nStart with (a + b)(c + 0) = a(c + 0) + b(c + 0) by left distributivity. Then, a(c + 0) = ac + a0 = ac + 0 = ac, similarly for b(c + 0) = bc. So left side is ac + bc. But the left side is also (a + b)(c + 0) = (a + b)c. Therefore, (a + b)c = ac + bc. So right distributivity holds.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So if left distributivity holds, then right distributivity can be derived? But that contradicts the standard definition of rings requiring both. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, wait. The step where I used left distributivity to expand (a + b)(c + 0) as a(c + 0) + b(c + 0) assumes that multiplication distributes over addition from the left, which is exactly left distributivity. So by applying left distributivity to the multiplication of (a + b) with (c + 0), we get that (a + b)(c + 0) = (a + b)c + (a + b)0. Wait, no, left distributivity is when you have a single element multiplied by a sum. Wait, no. Left distributivity is a(b + c) = ab + ac. Here, we have (a + b)(c + 0), which is a sum (a + b) multiplied by (c + 0). To apply left distributivity, we need to have a single element on the left. So perhaps I misapplied left distributivity here.\n\nWait, no. Left distributivity is when the left factor is a single element. So if we have (a + b) multiplied by (c + 0), we cannot apply left distributivity directly unless we treat (a + b) as a single element. But left distributivity is when the left-hand side is a single element. So actually, to apply left distributivity here, we would need to have something like d*(e + f) = d*e + d*f. In this case, d is (a + b), and e + f is (c + 0). Therefore, by left distributivity, (a + b)(c + 0) = (a + b)c + (a + b)0. But this is exactly using left distributivity where the left element is (a + b). However, left distributivity as given in the problem is for any a, b, c, so even if a is a sum like (a + b), it should still apply. So this expansion is valid.\n\nThen, as before, (a + b)(c + 0) = (a + b)c + (a + b)0. On the other hand, expanding via left distributivity (treating (a + b) as a single element) is allowed. But also, we can expand the right-hand side as a(c + 0) + b(c + 0) by applying left distributivity again. Wait, no. To get a(c + 0) + b(c + 0), we need to have (a + b) acting as the multiplier on (c + 0). But that would be left distributivity applied to (a + b) multiplied by (c + 0), giving (a + b)c + (a + b)0. Then, separately, we can consider (a + b)c as ac + bc if we have right distributivity, but we don't have that yet. Wait, this seems circular.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The user is assuming only left distributivity. Let's suppose we have a structure where addition is commutative and associative, multiplication is associative, and left distributivity holds. Then, when we compute (a + b)(c + 0), we can use left distributivity to say that (a + b)(c + 0) = (a + b)c + (a + b)0. However, we also know that multiplying by zero gives zero, so (a + b)0 = 0. Thus, (a + b)(c + 0) = (a + b)c + 0 = (a + b)c.\n\nOn the other hand, since addition is commutative and associative, and we have left distributivity, can we expand (a + b)(c + 0) in another way? Let's try to apply left distributivity by breaking down the left factor. Wait, left distributivity is about the left element distributing over a sum on the right. If we have a sum on the left, left distributivity doesn't directly apply unless we consider each term in the sum. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the left distributivity allows us to distribute each term in the left sum over the right sum. Wait, but that's essentially the right distributivity. For example, (a + b)c = ac + bc is right distributivity. But if we can derive this from left distributivity, then we're done.\n\nBut in our previous attempt, we tried to use left distributivity on (a + b)(c + 0) and equate it to a(c + 0) + b(c + 0). But is that valid? Wait, no. Left distributivity is when you have a single element on the left and a sum on the right. So to expand (a + b)(c + 0), since the left side is a sum (a + b), we can't apply left distributivity directly. Instead, we would need right distributivity to handle the sum on the left. Therefore, my initial mistake was assuming that left distributivity could be applied to a sum on the left, but actually, left distributivity only applies when the left side is a single element.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to realize that left distributivity handles distributing a single element over a sum on the right, while right distributivity handles distributing a sum on the left over a single element on the right. They are different, and one cannot derive one from the other without additional structure.\n\nBut the user mentioned that the ring has a unity. Does the presence of a unity help here? Let's consider using the unity to express elements in terms of multiplication by 1. For example, take any element a. Then a = a*1. Let's see if that helps.\n\nSuppose we want to prove (a + b)c = ac + bc. Let's write (a + b)c as (a + b)(c*1). If we can apply left distributivity here, treating c as a single element. Wait, but (a + b)(c*1) would be left distributivity only if we have a single element on the left. Wait, no. Again, left distributivity is a*(b + c) = ab + ac. Here, we have (a + b)*c*1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, write (a + b)c = (a + b)(c*1) = c*(a + b)*1. But this doesn't help unless multiplication is commutative.\n\nAnother approach: Let's use the unity to create an expression that can apply left distributivity. For example, consider 1*(a + b)c. Using left distributivity, this is 1*(a + b)c = (1*a + 1*b)c = (a + b)c. But this is just the same as before. Alternatively, expand 1*( (a + b)c ) using left distributivity. But that would require knowing how to distribute 1 over the product (a + b)c, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider the expression (a + b)(1*c). Since multiplication is associative, this is ((a + b)*1)*c = (a + b)*c. But again, this just restates the same thing.\n\nWait, maybe using additive inverses. Let's assume that the additive group is abelian, so we can write -(a + b) = (-a) + (-b). Suppose we compute (a + b)c + (-a)c + (-b)c. If we can show this is zero, then (a + b)c = ac + bc. But again, to show that (-a)c is the additive inverse of ac, we need right distributivity. Because in a ring, we have a*0 = 0 and 0*a = 0, and a*(-b) = -ab and (-a)*b = -ab. But does this require right distributivity?\n\nLet me recall the standard proofs. In a ring, to show that (-a)b = -ab, we can use distributivity: ab + (-a)b = (a + (-a))b = 0*b = 0. Therefore, (-a)b = -ab. But this uses right distributivity. Similarly, a*(-b) = -ab uses left distributivity. So if we only have left distributivity, we can prove a*(-b) = -ab, but not necessarily (-a)b = -ab. Because proving (-a)b = -ab requires right distributivity. Therefore, without right distributivity, we might not have (-a)b = -ab.\n\nTherefore, if we only have left distributivity, we can't be sure that (-a)b = -ab. Therefore, trying to use additive inverses to derive right distributivity may not work because we can't establish the necessary properties of multiplication by negatives.\n\nSo, coming back, if we can't derive right distributivity from left distributivity even with a unity, then the answer is that both distributive laws are necessary, and one cannot be derived from the other even in the presence of a unity. Therefore, the example the user is asking for—a structure that satisfies all ring axioms except one distributive law—exists, meaning that both distributive laws are independent axioms.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if one can prove that left distributivity implies right distributivity in the presence of a unity. According to the above reasoning, the answer is no. To confirm, we need a counterexample: a structure with unity where left distributivity holds but right distributivity fails.\n\nConsider constructing such an example. Let's take a set with two elements, 0 and 1, define addition modulo 2, and define multiplication in a way that left distributivity holds but right distributivity doesn't. For example, define multiplication such that a*b = a (projection onto the left). Then check:\n\nLeft distributivity: a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c. Since a*(b + c) = a, and a*b + a*c = a + a = 0 if a is 0, and 1 + 1 = 0 if a is 1. Wait, but if a=1, then 1*(b + c) = 1, but 1*b + 1*c = 1 + 1 = 0 ≠ 1. So left distributivity fails. So this isn't a good example.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider a near-ring. Near-rings are algebraic structures where only one distributive law holds. Typically, right near-rings satisfy (a + b)c = ac + bc but not left distributivity. Similarly, left near-rings satisfy left distributivity but not right. So such examples exist in the theory of near-rings. Therefore, if we take a left near-ring with unity, it would satisfy all ring axioms except right distributivity, thus serving as a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that even in the presence of a unity, left distributivity does not imply right distributivity, and thus both are necessary in the definition of a ring. Therefore, the user's initial thought that they can't think of an example is because such structures are called near-rings and aren't as commonly discussed as rings, but they do exist.",
