    "Content": "Prove that for any integers $m$ and $n$ greater than $1$, at least one of the numbers $\\sqrt[n]{m}$ or $\\sqrt[m]{n}$ is not greater than $\\sqrt[3]{3}$. My attempt goes something along the lines of stating that for $(n,m)\\in\\{(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3)\\}$ is obvious, and for $n,m\\geq4$, if $n=m$ then one needs to prove $\\log_ 3n<n/3$, and if $n\\ne m$, I have no idea. As for proof of $\\log_ 3n<n/3$, is it enough to state that the equality holds for $n=3$ and that after that, for $n>3$, the slope of $f(n)=\\log_3n$ is smaller than $1/3$ (yields from $f'(n)=(n\\ln3)^{-1}<3^{-1}$ because $\\ln3>1$), so the function $f(n)$ doesn't raise fast enough to catch up to $n/3$, so there will be no more intersections?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You want to show that\n$$\n\\min\\left({\\sqrt[m]{n}, \\sqrt[n]{m}}\\right) \\le \\sqrt[3]{3}.\n$$\nRaising both sides to the $(3mn)$-th power, we see that this is equivalent to\n$$\n\\min\\left(m^{3m}, n^{3n}\\right)\\le 3^{mn}.\n$$\nAssume with no loss of generality that $m \\le n$; then $\\min\\left(m^{3m},n^{3n}\\right)=m^{3m}$ and $3^{mn}\\ge 3^{m^2}$.  Because\n$\nm^3 \\le 3^m\n$\nfor all $m\\ge 1$ (*), we have\n$$\nm^{3m} =\\left[m^3\\right]^{m}\\le \\left[3^{m}\\right]^{m} = 3^{m^2} \\le 3^{mn}$$\nand we're done. (*) The proof that $m^3 \\le 3^m$ for all $m \\ge 1$ is by induction: it holds for $m=1,2,3$ by direct inspection, and in going from $m$ to $m+1$ for $m\\ge 3$, the right-hand side is multiplied by $3$, while the left-hand side is multiplied by\n$$\\frac{(m+1)^3}{m^3}=1+\\frac{3}{m}+\\frac{3}{m^2}+\\frac{1}{m^3} \\le 1+\\frac{3}{3}+\\frac{3}{3^2}+\\frac{1}{3^3}<3.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that for integers m and n greater than 1, at least one of the nth root of m or the mth root of n is not greater than the cube root of 3. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states m and n are integers greater than 1. So each should be a separate assumption. Also, the problem is about showing that at least one of the two roots is ≤ cube root of 3. \n\nWait, the example given in the format had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this problem, the assumptions are that m and n are integers greater than 1. So each of those should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- m is an integer greater than 1.\n- n is an integer greater than 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove that either the nth root of m or the mth root of n is ≤ cube root of 3. \n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original question mentions cases where n and m are 2 or 3, and then considers n,m ≥4. But in the problem statement, those are part of the user's attempt, not the problem itself. The actual problem statement is the first part: \"Prove that for any integers m and n greater than 1, at least one of the numbers √[n]{m} or √[m]{n} is not greater than √[3]{3}.\"\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the two assumptions about m and n each being integers greater than 1, and then the problem statement as given. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other conditions. The user's attempt discusses specific cases and using derivatives for the logarithm function, but that's part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions. The problem itself doesn't add any other conditions beyond m and n being integers >1.\n\nSo the final formatted part should be:\n\nAssumption:\nm is an integer greater than 1,\nn is an integer greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that at least one of $\\sqrt[n]{m}$ or $\\sqrt[m]{n}$ is not greater than $\\sqrt[3]{3}$.\n\nWait, in LaTeX, the roots should be written with \\sqrt[n]{m} and \\sqrt[m]{n}. Also, the cube root of 3 is \\sqrt[3]{3}. The original problem uses \"≤\" (less than or equal to), so \"not greater than\" is equivalent. \n\nYes, that should be correct. The assumptions are clear and each on separate lines. The problem statement is as given.",
