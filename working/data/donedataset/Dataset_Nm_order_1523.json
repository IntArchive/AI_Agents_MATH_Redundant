First of all, the symmetry of the relation with respect to the variables $x$ and $t$ implies that $t$ solved for as a function of $x$ will have the same functional form as $x$ solved for as a function of $t$: $$1+8x=\\frac{k}{1+8t}\\implies t=\\frac{k-(1+8x)}{8(1+8x)},~~x=\\frac{k-(1+8t)}{8(1+8t)}.$$ Transforming the integral $\\mathcal{I}$ via this substitution, we find: $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{I}\n&=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{-2/3}\\,(1-x)^{-2/3}\\,(1+8x)^{-1/3}\\,\\ln{(1+8x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\ln{(1+8x)}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}\\,(1-x)^{2}\\,(1+8x)}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\int_{\\frac{k-1}{8}}^{\\frac{k-9}{72}}\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{2^{12}(1+8t)^{5}}{k(9-k+72t)^{2}(k-1-8t)^{2}}}\\,\\ln{\\left(\\frac{k}{1+8t}\\right)}\\cdot\\frac{(-k)}{(1+8t)^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{k}{9}\\right)^{2/3}\\int_{\\frac{k-9}{72}}^{\\frac{k-1}{8}}\\frac{\\ln{\\left(\\frac{k}{1+8t}\\right)}}{\\left(\\frac{9-k}{72}+t\\right)^{2/3}\\left(\\frac{k-1}{8}-t\\right)^{2/3}\\left(1+8t\\right)^{1/3}}\\,\\mathrm{d}t,\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ which clearly suggests the choice $k=9$ as being the simplest, in which case: $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{I}\n&=\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\ln{\\left(\\frac{9}{1+8t}\\right)}}{t^{2/3}\\left(1-t\\right)^{2/3}\\left(1+8t\\right)^{1/3}}\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\ln{\\left(9\\right)}}{t^{2/3}\\left(1-t\\right)^{2/3}\\left(1+8t\\right)^{1/3}}\\,\\mathrm{d}t-\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\ln{\\left(1+8t\\right)}}{t^{2/3}\\left(1-t\\right)^{2/3}\\left(1+8t\\right)^{1/3}}\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\\\\n&=2\\ln{(3)}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{t^{2/3}\\left(1-t\\right)^{2/3}\\left(1+8t\\right)^{1/3}}-\\mathcal{I}\\\\\n\\implies 2\\mathcal{I}&=2\\ln{(3)}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{t^{2/3}\\left(1-t\\right)^{2/3}\\left(1+8t\\right)^{1/3}}\\\\\n\\implies \\mathcal{I}&=\\ln{(3)}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{t^{2/3}\\left(1-t\\right)^{2/3}\\left(1+8t\\right)^{1/3}}\\\\\n&=:\\ln{(3)}\\,\\mathcal{J},\n\\end{align}$$ where in the last line we've simply introduced the symbol $\\mathcal{J}$ to denote the last integral for convenience. It's approximate value is $\\mathcal{J}\\approx3.53328$. Thus, to prove that the conjectured value $(1)$ is indeed correct, it suffices to prove the following equivalent conjecture: $$\\mathcal{J}:=\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{x^{2/3}(1-x)^{2/3}(1+8x)^{1/3}}\\stackrel{?}{=}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}\\,\\pi}\\left[\\Gamma{\\left(\\small{\\frac13}\\right)}\\right]^3.\\tag{2}$$ Representation and manipulation of integral as a hypergeometric function: Euler's integral representation for the Gauss hypergeometric\nfunction states that, for\n$\\Re{\\left(c\\right)}>\\Re{\\left(b\\right)}>0\\land\n|\\arg{\\left(1-z\\right)}|<\\pi$, we have: $$\\int_{0}^{1}x^{b-1}(1-x)^{c-b-1}(1-zx)^{-a}\\mathrm{d}x=\\operatorname{B}{\\left(b,c-b\\right)}\\,{_2F_1}{\\left(a,b;c;z\\right)}.$$ In particular, if we choose $z=-8$, $a=\\frac13$, $c=\\frac23$, and\n$b=\\frac13$, then the conditions\n$\\Re{\\left(\\frac23\\right)}>\\Re{\\left(\\frac13\\right)}>0\\land\n|\\arg{\\left(1-(-8)\\right)}|=0<\\pi$ are satisfied, and the integral on\nthe left-hand-side of Euler's representation reduces to the integral\n$\\mathcal{J}$. That is,: $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{J}\n&=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{-\\frac23}(1-x)^{-\\frac23}(1+8x)^{-\\frac13}\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13\\right)}\\,{_2F_1}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13;\\frac23;-8\\right)}.\n\\end{align}$$ Using the quadratic transformation , $${_2F_1}{\\left(a,b;2b;z\\right)} =\n\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-z}}{2}\\right)^{-2a}\n{_2F_1}{\\left(a,a-b+\\frac12;b+\\frac12;\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-z}}{1+\\sqrt{1-z}}\\right)^2\\right)},$$ with particular values $a=b=\\frac13,z=-8$, we have the hypergeometric identity, $${_2F_1}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13;\\frac23;-8\\right)} = 2^{-\\frac23}\n{_2F_1}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac12;\\frac56;\\frac14\\right)}.$$ Then, applying Euler's transformation , $${_2F_1}{\\left(a,b;c;z\\right)}=(1-z)^{c-a-b}{_2F_1}{\\left(c-a,c-b;c;z\\right)},$$ we have, $${_2F_1}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac12;\\frac56;\\frac14\\right)}={_2F_1}{\\left(\\frac12,\\frac13;\\frac56;\\frac14\\right)}.$$ Now, Euler's integral representation for this hypergeometric function implies: $${_2F_1}{\\left(\\frac12,\\frac13;\\frac56;\\frac14\\right)}=\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac12\\right)}}\\int_{0}^{1}x^{-\\frac23}(1-x)^{-\\frac12}\\left(1-\\small{\\frac14}x\\right)^{-\\frac12}\\mathrm{d}x.$$ Hence, $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{J}\n&=\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13\\right)}\\,{_2F_1}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13;\\frac23;-8\\right)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13\\right)}}{2^{2/3}}\\,{_2F_1}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac12;\\frac56;\\frac14\\right)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13\\right)}}{2^{2/3}}\\,{_2F_1}{\\left(\\frac12,\\frac13;\\frac56;\\frac14\\right)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13\\right)}}{2^{2/3}\\,\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac12\\right)}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}x^{-\\frac23}(1-x)^{-\\frac12}\\left(1-\\small{\\frac14}x\\right)^{-\\frac12}\\mathrm{d}x.\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ The ratio of beta functions in the last line above simplifies considerably. The Legendre duplication formula for the gamma function states: $$\\Gamma{\\left(2z\\right)}=\\frac{2^{2z-1}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\Gamma{\\left(z\\right)}\\Gamma{\\left(z+\\frac12\\right)}.$$ Letting $z=\\frac13$ yields: $$\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac23\\right)}=\\frac{2^{-1/3}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac13\\right)}\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac56\\right)}.$$ Then, using the facts that $\\operatorname{B}{\\left(a,b\\right)}=\\frac{\\Gamma{\\left(a\\right)}\\,\\Gamma{\\left(b\\right)}}{\\Gamma{\\left(a+b\\right)}}$ and $\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac12\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\pi}$, we can simplify the ratio of beta functions above considerably: $$\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13\\right)}}{\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac12\\right)}}\n&=\\frac{\\left[\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac13\\right)}\\right]^2\\,\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac56\\right)}}{\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac23\\right)}\\,\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac12\\right)}\\,\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac13\\right)}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac13\\right)}\\,\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac56\\right)}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,\\Gamma{\\left(\\frac23\\right)}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,\\sqrt[3]{2}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt[3]{2}.\n\\end{align}$$ Thus, $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{J}\n&=\\frac{\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac13\\right)}}{2^{2/3}\\,\\operatorname{B}{\\left(\\frac13,\\frac12\\right)}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}x^{-\\frac23}(1-x)^{-\\frac12}\\left(1-\\small{\\frac14}x\\right)^{-\\frac12}\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{2^{2/3}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}x^{-\\frac23}(1-x)^{-\\frac12}\\left(1-\\small{\\frac14}x\\right)^{-\\frac12}\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^{-\\frac23}}{\\sqrt{\\left(1-x\\right)\\left(1-\\small{\\frac14}x\\right)}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x.\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ Reduction of integral to pseudo-elliptic integrals: Substituting $x=t^3$ into the integral representation for $\\mathcal{J}$, we reduce the problem to solving an integral whose integrand is the reciprocal square-root of a sixth-degree polynomial: $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{J}\n&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^{-\\frac23}}{\\sqrt{\\left(1-x\\right)\\left(1-\\small{\\frac14}x\\right)}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^{-\\frac23}}{\\sqrt{\\left(1-x\\right)\\left(4-x\\right)}}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\frac13\\,x^{-\\frac23}\\,\\mathrm{d}x}{\\sqrt{\\left(1-x\\right)\\left(4-x\\right)}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\sqrt{\\left(1-t^3\\right)\\left(4-t^3\\right)}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\sqrt{4-5t^3+t^6}}.\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ Then, substituting $t=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\,u$ gives us a similar integrand except with a sixth-degree polynomial with symmetric coefficients: $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{J}\n&=\\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\sqrt{4-5t^3+t^6}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\,\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}}\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}u}{\\sqrt{4-10u^3+4u^6}}\\\\\n&=3\\,\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\sqrt{1-\\small{\\frac52}u^3+u^6}}.\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ The form of the integral $\\mathcal{J}$ found in the last line above is significant because it may be transformed into a pair of pseudo-elliptic integrals , which can subsequently be evaluated in terms of elementary functions and elliptic integrals. For more information on these types of integrals, see my question here . Substituting $u=z-\\sqrt{z^2-1}$ transforms the integral $\\mathcal{J}$ into a sum of two pseudo-elliptic integrals: $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{J}\n&=3\\,\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\sqrt{1-\\small{\\frac52}u^3+u^6}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\int_{2^{-2/3}+2^{-4/3}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\sqrt{(z+1)(8z^3-6z-\\frac52)}}+\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\int_{2^{-2/3}+2^{-4/3}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\sqrt{(z-1)(8z^3-6z-\\frac52)}}\\\\\n&=3\\,\\int_{2^{-2/3}+2^{-4/3}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\sqrt{(z+1)(16z^3-12z-5)}}+3\\,\\int_{2^{-2/3}+2^{-4/3}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\sqrt{(z-1)(16z^3-12z-5)}}\\\\\n&=\\frac34\\,\\int_{2^{-2/3}+2^{-4/3}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\sqrt{(z+1)(z^3-\\small{\\frac34}z-\\small{\\frac{5}{16}})}}+\\frac34\\,\\int_{2^{-2/3}+2^{-4/3}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\sqrt{(z-1)(z^3-\\small{\\frac34}z-\\small{\\frac{5}{16}})}}\\\\\n&=:\\frac34\\,P_{+}+\\frac34\\,P_{-},\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ where in the last line we've introduced the auxiliary notation $P_{\\pm}$ to denote the pair of integrals, $$P_{\\pm}:=\\int_{2^{-2/3}+2^{-4/3}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\sqrt{(z\\pm1)(z^3-\\small{\\frac34}z-\\small{\\frac{5}{16}})}}.$$ Evaluation of pseudo-elliptic integrals: Again for convenience, we shall denote the lower integration limit in the integrals $P_{\\pm}$ defined above by $2^{-2/3}+2^{-4/3}=:\\alpha\\approx1.026811$. In particular, this eases the factorization of the cubic polynomial in the denominators above: $$\\begin{align}\n16x^3-12x-5\n&=16\\left(x-\\alpha\\right)\\left(x^2+\\alpha x+\\alpha^2-\\small{\\frac34}\\right)\\\\\n&=16\\left(x-\\alpha\\right)\\left[\\left(x+\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac34\\left(\\alpha^2-1\\right)\\right].\n\\end{align}$$ Then, $$\\begin{align}\nP_{\\pm}\n&=\\int_{2^{-2/3}+2^{-4/3}}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\sqrt{(x\\pm1)(x^3-\\small{\\frac34}x-\\small{\\frac{5}{16}})}}\\\\\n&=\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\sqrt{(x\\pm1)(x^3-\\small{\\frac34}x-\\small{\\frac{5}{16}})}}\\\\\n&=\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\sqrt{(x\\pm1)(x-\\alpha)(x^2+\\alpha x+\\alpha^2-\\small{\\frac34})}}\\\\\n&=\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\sqrt{(x\\pm1)\\left(x-\\alpha\\right)\\left[\\left(x+\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)^2+\\small{\\frac34}\\left(\\alpha^2-1\\right)\\right]}}.\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ EDIT: I'm beginning to fear this strategy of derivation may be ultimately fruitless. The good news is that there is a relatively compact way of expressing the two integrals above as incomplete elliptic integrals: Assume $\\alpha,\\beta,u,m,n\\in\\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\beta<\\alpha<u$. Then proposition 3.145 (1) of Gradshteyn's Table of Integrals, Series, and Products states:\n  $$\\begin{align}\n\\small{\\int_{\\alpha}^{u}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\sqrt{\\left(x-\\alpha\\right)\\left(x-\\beta\\right)\\left[\\left(x-m\\right)^2+n^2\\right]}}}\n&=\\small{\\frac{1}{pq}F{\\left(2\\arctan{\\sqrt{\\frac{q\\left(u-\\alpha\\right)}{p\\left(u-\\beta\\right)}}},\\frac12\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(p+q\\right)^2+\\left(\\alpha-\\beta\\right)^2}{pq}}\\right)},}\n\\end{align}$$\n  where $(m-\\alpha)^2+n^2=p^2$, and $(m-\\beta)^2+n^2=q^2$. The bad news is after plugging in all the appropriate values, the resulting arguments of the elliptic integrals are significantly more complex than I expected.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving a specific integral equals a given expression involving gamma functions and logarithms. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to 1. The integrand is a function involving ln(1+8x) divided by a product of terms raised to fractional powers: x^(2/3), (1-x)^(2/3), and (1+8x)^(1/3). The problem states that this integral is equal to (ln3)/(pi*sqrt3) times the cube of the gamma function at 1/3.\n\nLooking at the assumptions, each should address one property or condition applied to one object. The integral's limits are from 0 to 1, so that's an assumption on the integral's bounds. The integrand's structure includes specific exponents for x, (1-x), and (1+8x), each of these components should be listed as separate assumptions. Also, the presence of the logarithm term ln(1+8x) is another condition. \n\nAdditionally, the equivalence to the hypergeometric function derivative might be part of the problem statement, but since the user wants to filter unrelated info, perhaps the main problem is the integral equality. The update mentions a generalization, but that's probably extra context not needed for the core problem. \n\nSo the assumptions would include the integral's bounds, each term in the denominator with their exponents, and the numerator being ln(1+8x). The problem is to prove that this integral equals the given gamma function expression. Let me check the example again to ensure each assumption is one line per object. The example had two assumptions: n is integer and divisible by 7. But here, the integrand's components are separate terms. So each part of the integrand's denominator should be a separate assumption. Also, the numerator is a separate component. Wait, but the problem might not have multiple assumptions but rather a single integrand structure. However, the format requires each assumption to be one line. So perhaps breaking down the integrand into its components:\n\nAssumption 1: The integral is from 0 to 1.\n\nAssumption 2: The integrand is ln(1 + 8x) divided by [x^(2/3) * (1 - x)^(2/3) * (1 + 8x)^(1/3)].\n\nBut maybe each factor in the denominator is a separate assumption? Wait, the example didn't break down the terms in A(n); it just listed assumptions on n. Here, the integrand is a single expression, so perhaps the entire integrand's form is one assumption. However, the example shows that assumptions can be conditions on variables or specific properties. Since the integrand's structure is part of the problem's setup, maybe the key assumptions are the limits of integration and the form of the integrand. However, the user's example had two assumptions on n. In this case, maybe:\n\nAssumption 1: The integral is evaluated from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nAssumption 2: The integrand is [ln(1 + 8x)] / [x^(2/3) * (1 - x)^(2/3) * (1 + 8x)^(1/3)].\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single property on one object. Here, the integrand is a combination of multiple factors. However, the user's example combined all terms into the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the problem statement included the expression A(n), and the assumptions were on n. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be on the variables and conditions of the integral, but the integrand's form is part of the problem statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were on n (n is integer, n divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So here, perhaps the assumptions are on the integral's limits and the exponents in the integrand. But the integrand is part of the problem statement. Wait, maybe the problem statement includes the integral expression, and the assumptions are any underlying conditions needed for convergence, etc. However, since the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand has terms like x^(2/3) which might have issues at 0, but since the problem is given, maybe the assumptions are just that the integral is from 0 to 1 and the integrand is as given. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut that's one assumption. The integrand's structure is part of the problem. Wait, the example didn't list the components of A(n) as assumptions; instead, the assumptions were on n. So in this case, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral being from 0 to 1, but the problem is to evaluate the integral with that specific integrand. However, the original problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond what's given. Let me re-read the original problem.\n\nThe original problem is: Prove that the integral from 0 to 1 of [ln(1+8x) divided by x^(2/3) (1-x)^(2/3) (1+8x)^(1/3)] dx equals (ln3)/(pi sqrt3) Gamma^3(1/3). There's no additional conditions mentioned except the integral's limits. So perhaps the only assumption is the integral's bounds. The integrand's form is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: The integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $${\\large\\int}_0^1\\frac{\\ln(1+8x)}{x^{2/3}\\,(1-x)^{2/3}\\,(1+8x)^{1/3}}dx=\\frac{\\ln3}{\\pi\\sqrt3}\\Gamma^3\\!\\left(\\tfrac13\\right).$$\n\nBut in the example, the problem statement included the expression with the assumptions on n. Here, the integrand is part of the problem statement. So perhaps the assumptions here are the integral's limits and maybe the exponents in the denominator, but since the exponents are part of the integrand's definition, they are included in the problem statement. Therefore, the correct way is to have the assumption be the integral from 0 to 1, and the problem is to prove the equality with the integrand as given. So the assumption is just that the integral is from 0 to 1. But wait, maybe there's more. For example, the integrand's terms must be defined and the integral convergent. Since x^(2/3) and (1-x)^(2/3) are in the denominator, near x=0 and x=1, the integrand behaves like x^(-2/3) and (1-x)^(-2/3), which are integrable over [0,1]. So the integral converges, but perhaps that's an implicit assumption. The problem likely assumes the integral is well-defined. So perhaps the only explicit assumption is the integral's bounds. Thus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n\nProblem: Prove that $${\\large\\int}_0^1\\frac{\\ln(1+8x)}{x^{2/3}\\,(1-x)^{2/3}\\,(1+8x)^{1/3}}dx=\\frac{\\ln3}{\\pi\\sqrt3}\\Gamma^3\\!\\left(\\tfrac13\\right).$$\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions equivalence to a hypergeometric function derivative, but the user example didn't include alternative forms, perhaps the main problem is the integral equality, and the other parts are extra. So sticking to the integral expression as the problem. Therefore, the answer would follow the example's structure, with the assumption on the integral's limits and the problem stating the equality.",
