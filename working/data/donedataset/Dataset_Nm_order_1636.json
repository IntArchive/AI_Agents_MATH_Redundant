    "Content": "In general, I struggle working with quotients of polynomial rings, so I was hoping someone might be able to help with the following exercise: Show that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2x)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ , but the latter is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ . Mostly I want to understand what these quotients all \"look like.\" We did few examples in class and few homework problems with such quotients, and the ones we do work with are much simpler (typically involving $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ or $\\mathbb{R}$ instead of $\\mathbb{Q}$ ). Any help is appreciated, thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We describe the quotient rings in a concrete, computational way. Let us review the definition, say for $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2x)$ .  Two polynomials $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are  called equivalent modulo $x^2-2x$ if their difference is divisible by $x^2-2x$ .  Then $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2x)$ officially consists of the equivalence classes, with the \"natural\" addition and multiplication modulo $x^2-2x$ . For any polynomial $A(x)$ , there exist unique polynomials $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ such that $R(x)$ has degree $\\lt 2$ and $$A(x)=(x^2-2x)Q(x)+R(x).$$ It follows that $A(x)$ is equivalent to $R(x)$ .  It is easy to see that two polynomials of degree $\\lt 2$ are equivalent iff they are equal. Thus the equivalence classes can be identified with the polynomials of degree $\\lt 2$ .  Addition is the obvious one.  Multiplication is a bit trickier. Let us see how to compute the polynomial of degree $\\lt 2$ which is equivalent to $(ax+b)(cx+d)$ . Multiply in the natural way, to obtain $ac x^2+(ac+bd)x + bd$ .  Now recall that $x^2-2x$ is equivalent to $0$ , so replace $x^2$ by $2x$ (to be explicit: $x^2 - 2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 2x$ ).  We obtain $(2ac +ac+bd)x +bd$ .  Now we have an explicit formula for the product. An analogy :  The ring $\\mathbb{Z}/(12)$ is officially  made up of equivalence classes, where $a$ and $b$ are called equivalent if their difference is divisible by $12$ .  But it is very useful to think of $\\mathbb{Z}/(12)$ as made up of the objects $0,1,2, \\dots, 11$ , with new addition and multiplication. (For example, $5+9=2$ , $5\\times 9=9$ .) Similarly, the quotient rings we are looking at can be viewed either abstractly, or concretely as polynomials of degree $\\lt 2$ , with an unusual multiplication. Since we have a concrete picture of what is going on, we should be able to answer some questions. First we show that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ . Let's view $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ as the polynomials of degree $\\lt 2$ , with the natural multiplication except that $x^2$ is always replaced by $0$ . Then, in the quotient ring, $(x)(x)=0$ . (Strictly speaking, the equivalence class of $x$ , times itself, is equal to the equivalence class of $0$ .) So $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ has a non-zero element whose square is $0$ . We show that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ has no such element. Suppose to the contrary that in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ , the square of (the equivalence class of) $ax+b$ is $0$ , that is, $(ax+b)^2$ is equivalent to $0$ modulo $x^2-1$ . Do the squaring. First we get $a^2x^2+2abx+b^2$ .  Then, since $x^2-1$ is equivalent to $0$ , we replace $x^2$ by $1$ , and obtain $2abx+b^2+1$ .  Could this be the $0$ polynomial? No, because the constant term $b^2+1$ cannot be $0$ . So $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ differ in a structural property: The first has a non-zero object whose square is $0$ , and the second does not. But any isomorphism $\\phi$ from $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ must preserve such structural properties.  For completeness we do the details. Suppose that $w\\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ is non-zero and $\\phi(w^2)=0$ , then $\\phi(w)\\ne 0$ and $0=\\phi(w^2)=(\\phi(w))^2$ . So the square of $\\phi(w)$ is $0$ . This contradicts our earlier calculation, which showed that the square of a non-zero element of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ cannot be zero. Next we show that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2x)$ . Since $x^2-2x=(x-1)^2-1$ , the equivalence class of $x$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ should behave like the equivalence class of $x-1$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2x)$ . Since we are dealing with equivalence classes modulo two different polynomials, let us change to a more precise notation.  Denote the equivalence class of $P(x)$ modulo $x^2-1$ by $P(x)/(x^2-1)$ , and modulo $x^2-2x$ by $P(x)/(x^2-2x)$ .  (We should have used this more precise notation from the beginning, but avoided it for the sake of greater concreteness.  But in what follows, don't let the $/(??)$ parts worry you, and maybe even omit them.) So what should $(ax+b)/(x^2-1)$ be sent to by our isomorphism $\\phi$ ? The natural choice is $(a(x-1) +b)/(x^2-2x)$ . It is clear that  (equivalence classes modulo $x^2-1$ of) polynomials of degree $\\lt 2$ are sent bijectively by $\\phi$ to (equivalence classes modulo $x^2-2x$ of) polynomials of degree $\\lt 2$ .  We must also check that $\\phi$ preserves addition and multiplication. Checking the addition is very easy. Let's deal with the multiplication.  Look at $(ax+b)(cx+d)$ .  Modulo $x^2-1$ , this is (equivalent to) $(ad+bc)x + ac+bd$ . Note that $\\phi$ maps $(ax+b)/(x^2-1)$ to $(a(x-1)+b)/(x^2-2x)$ and maps $(cx+d)/(x^2-1)$ to $(c(x-1)+d)/(x^2-2x)$ . Also, $\\phi$ maps $((ad+bc)x + ac+bd)/(x^2-1)$ to $((ac+bd)(x-1)+ ac+bd)/(x^2-2x)$ . So we need to verify verify that $$(a(x-1)+b)(c(x-1)+d) \\quad\\text{is equivalent to}\\quad (ac+bd)(x-1)+ ac+bd$$ modulo $x^2-2x$ . Multiply out the left-hand side, using the fact that $(x-1)^2-1$ is equivalent to $0$ . We get $(ac+bd)(x-1)+ac+bd$ , exactly what is wanted. Comment :  Look for example at $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2x)$ .  The fact that $x^2-2x$ factors nicely means that we can express $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-1)$ as a direct product of simpler structures. This important structural information is easiest to approach through a more abstract approach.  However, a concrete view of things is always useful, both for the understanding and for computational  algebra.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and format a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified structure. Let me start by carefully reading the original question to extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original question is titled \"Understanding quotients of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$\". The user is asking about showing that two specific quotient rings are isomorphic and that another isn't. They also mention struggling with visualizing these quotients and wanting to understand their structure better.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions in the problem. The example provided in the user's instruction lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. Looking at the problem here, the main objects are the quotient rings $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$, $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$, and $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$. \n\nThe problem states three things:\n1. Show that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$.\n2. Show that the latter (which would be $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$) is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$.\n3. The user wants to understand what these quotients look like, mentioning they usually work with simpler fields like $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, or $\\mathbb{R}$ instead of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nNow, the assumptions here aren't explicitly stated in the problem, but they might be implicit. For quotient rings, the key assumptions are about the rings and the ideals they're quotienting by. Each quotient is by a principal ideal generated by a polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. So, each quotient ring is a polynomial ring over $\\mathbb{Q}$ modulo a specific quadratic polynomial. \n\nBut the problem doesn't state any additional conditions except the structure of these rings. Since the example given in the user's instruction included an assumption about divisibility, but here there's no such condition. Wait, the problem is purely about the structure of these quotient rings. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the quotient rings themselves. However, in the user's example, they included assumptions that weren't directly in the original problem. Wait, in their example, the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect. Hmm. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So in the example, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, but the user restructured it. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nLooking at the current problem, the user's question is to show that two quotient rings are isomorphic and another is not. The assumptions here would relate to the structures of these quotient rings. However, since the problem is about the general case (over $\\mathbb{Q}$), the key assumption is that we're working with the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and taking quotients by the given ideals. Since the problem doesn't specify any particular constraints beyond the polynomials defining the ideals, the assumptions would be that each quotient is taken with respect to the given polynomial. But since the user's example had each assumption line addressing one property applied to one object, perhaps here each quotient ring is an assumption. But the problem is to compare them. Wait, perhaps the assumptions here are that each quotient ring is a quotient of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ by the specified ideal. But since the problem is to show isomorphisms between some and not others, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The first quotient ring is $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$.\n\n- The second quotient ring is $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$.\n\n- The third quotient ring is $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$.\n\nBut the problem is to show the first two are isomorphic, and the second is not isomorphic to the third. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the three quotient rings, each as a separate assumption. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were about the variables (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about algebraic structures. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the rings involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the problem statement. The problem is to show these isomorphisms, so the assumptions are the definitions of the quotient rings. Thus, each quotient ring is an assumption. However, the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So each line is one assumption applied to one object. Therefore, for this problem, each quotient ring would be an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$ is a quotient ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$ is a quotient ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ is a quotient ring.\n\nBut that seems redundant because they are all quotient rings by definition. Alternatively, perhaps the polynomials used to generate the ideals are the key points. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ideal $(x^2 - 2x)$ is generated by $x^2 - 2x$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$,\nThe ideal $(x^2 - 1)$ is generated by $x^2 - 1$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$,\nThe ideal $(x^2)$ is generated by $x^2$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n\nBut again, that's inherent to the notation. The problem is to show the isomorphism between the first two and that the second isn't isomorphic to the third. Perhaps the key assumptions are the properties of the polynomials, like being reducible or irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFor example, $x^2 - 2x$ factors as x(x-2), so the ideal is not prime (since the polynomial is reducible), same with $x^2 -1$ which factors as (x-1)(x+1), while $x^2$ is (x)^2. But maybe these are relevant to the structure of the quotient rings. However, the user hasn't mentioned these as assumptions, but rather as part of the problem. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about showing isomorphisms and non-isomorphism, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the given quotient rings. Thus, the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are the existence of these quotient rings. But in the user's example, they listed the variables' properties as assumptions. Here, there are no variables, but structures. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$ is a ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$ is a ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ is a ring.\n\nBut that's trivial, as quotient rings are rings by definition. So perhaps the user's intended format is to list the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem is to show isomorphisms between the first two and not the third, the assumptions might be the specific forms of the quotient rings. However, the user's example extracted assumptions from the problem statement, even if they were not explicitly listed. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake unless the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to restructure the problem with necessary assumptions. \n\nBut in the current problem, there are no such hidden assumptions. The problem is straightforward: given three quotient rings, show two are isomorphic and one isn't. So perhaps the assumptions are just the definitions of the quotient rings. However, the user's example included multiple assumptions even when the problem didn't state them. Maybe in this case, since the problem is about quotient rings over $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, the assumption is that we're working over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is different from the examples the user mentioned (like $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_3$). So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial ring is over $\\mathbb{Q}$,\nThe ideal is generated by a quadratic polynomial.\n\nBut the problem states \"quotients of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$\", so the field is already $\\mathbb{Q}$. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the polynomials beyond being quadratic. However, the user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The original question mentions that they are working with $\\mathbb{Q}$ instead of simpler fields. So maybe the key assumption here is that the base field is $\\mathbb{Q}$, which affects the structure of the quotient rings. But in terms of the problem's assumptions for the format, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ is the field of coefficients,\nEach quotient ring is formed by modding out $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ by a principal ideal generated by a quadratic polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is about specific ideals: (x²-2x), (x²-1), and (x²). So maybe each of these polynomials is an assumption. Alternatively, the problem is to compare these three quotient rings, so the assumptions are their definitions. \n\nBut following the example, where the assumptions were about the variable (n being integer, n divisible by 7), even if the original problem didn't state that. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless the original example had a different problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because in their example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would restrict n. That seems incorrect. So perhaps the user's example is flawed, but I need to follow their instruction regardless.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$ is a quotient ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$ is a quotient ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ is a quotient ring.\n\nBut again, that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no specific assumptions beyond the given quotient rings. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions section is left blank, but the user's format requires it. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are about the properties of the quotient rings, like being commutative, having certain dimensions, etc. But those are inherent properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are that the user is working over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is different from the examples they did in class with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, etc. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe coefficient field is $\\mathbb{Q}$,\nEach quotient ring is of the form $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x))$ where $f(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nBut the problem already states that. Hmm. Given the user's example, which included assumptions that may not have been explicitly stated, perhaps here the assumptions are the specific polynomials used to generate the ideals. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ideal $(x^2 - 2x)$ is considered in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$,\nThe ideal $(x^2 - 1)$ is considered in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$,\nThe ideal $(x^2)$ is considered in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n\nBut again, that's repeating the problem statement. Given the user's example, perhaps the correct approach is to list the objects involved as assumptions. Since the problem is to compare these three quotient rings, the assumptions are the existence of these three quotient rings. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, since there are no variables, it's about the structures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed here, and the problem is self-contained. But the user's format requires an assumption section. In that case, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is a polynomial ring over $\\mathbb{Q}$,\nQuotient rings are formed by modding out by ideals generated by quadratic polynomials.\n\nBut the problem explicitly mentions these quotient rings, so perhaps the assumptions are redundant. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. Given the problem is to show isomorphism between the first two, which factor into linear terms over $\\mathbb{Q}$, whereas the third is a double root. So the key difference is that the first two are reducible, and the third is a square. But maybe the assumption is that the polynomials split into distinct linear factors. However, that's part of the problem's solution, not assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's given, and the user's example was an exception. Therefore, for this problem, the assumptions section can be:\n\nAssumption:\nNone beyond the problem statement.\n\nBut the user's example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them. So perhaps the correct approach is to list the quotient rings as the assumptions. Each quotient ring is an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$ is a quotient ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$ is a quotient ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ is a quotient ring.\n\nBut again, that's stating the obvious. Alternatively, the problem's assumptions are that these quotient rings are considered over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is different from the user's previous experience with finite fields. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe coefficient field for all polynomial rings is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBut the problem already states that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem has no specific assumptions beyond the given quotient rings, so perhaps the assumptions section is empty. But the user's format requires it. In their example, even if the original problem didn't state the assumptions, they added them. So perhaps in this case, since the problem is about quotient rings over $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, and the user mentioned that they usually work with simpler fields, the assumption is that we're working with $\\mathbb{Q}$ here. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial rings are over the field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBut that is already stated in the problem. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look again at the user's example. Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7, which restricts it. This seems incorrect. Unless there was a mistake in the example. Maybe the user intended a different example where the problem had a hidden assumption. But regardless, following the user's instructions, I need to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the objects are the quotient rings. The problem is to show isomorphism between the first two and not the third. The key properties are the polynomials defining the ideals. So perhaps the assumptions are the specific polynomials used. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ideal $(x^2 - 2x)$ is generated by $x^2 - 2x$,\nThe ideal $(x^2 - 1)$ is generated by $x^2 - 1$,\nThe ideal $(x^2)$ is generated by $x^2$.\n\nBut again, this is redundant as it's stated in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps there's an implicit assumption that these polynomials are being considered over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a field where they factor differently. But the problem already mentions $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nGiven the confusion here, perhaps the user's intended format for assumptions is to list each mathematical object involved and their conditions. Since the problem is about quotient rings, the assumptions are the definitions of those rings. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nConsider the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$,\nConsider the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$,\nConsider the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption line. That would fit the example where each assumption is about one object. The problem then is to show the isomorphisms as stated. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$ is a quotient ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$ is a quotient ring,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ is a quotient ring.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$, but the latter is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$.\n\nBut in the user's example, they rephrased the problem statement to include the assumptions. Wait, in their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a typo, but the user corrected it. \n\nIn any case, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to list all conditions and objects involved. In the current problem, the objects are the three quotient rings. Therefore, each quotient ring is listed as an assumption. Then the problem is as stated.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$ is a quotient ring of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$ is a quotient ring of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$,\n$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$ is a quotient ring of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\nProblem:\nShow that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 2x)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2 - 1)$, but the latter is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$.\n###",
