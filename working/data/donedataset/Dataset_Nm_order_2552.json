    "Content": "As a compromise to this question , can we claim that the following symmetric complex matrix \\begin{align*}\nS = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 + 2i & 1 + 3i & \\cdots & 1 + ni \\\\\n1 + 2i & 0 & 2 + 3i & \\cdots & 2 + ni \\\\\n1 + 3i & 2 + 3i & 0 & \\cdots & 3 + n i \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n1 + ni & 2 + ni & 3 + ni & \\cdots & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*} is non-singular? To clarify, the $(k, l)$ entry of $S$ is \\begin{align*}\ns_{kl} = \\begin{cases}\nk + il & l > k, \\\\\n0      & l = k, \\\\\ns_{lk} & k > l.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align*} Through some row/column reduction, I have shown that \\begin{align*}\n\\det(S) = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 1 + 2i & i & \\cdots & i & i \\\\\n1 + 2i & -2(1 + 2i) & 2 + 2i & & \\\\\ni & 2 + 2i & -2(2 + 3i) & \\ddots & \\\\\n\\vdots &   & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\ni      &   &        & (n - 2) + (n - 2)i & -2[(n - 2) + (n - 1)i] & (n - 1)  + (n - 1)i \\\\\ni      &   &        &                    & (n - 1) + (n - 1)i     & -2[(n - 1) + ni]\n\\end{vmatrix}. \\tag{$*$}\n\\end{align*} Then I got stuck here. Is there any clever way to get around this? Or demonstrating the invertibility through other angles (say, linear independence or eigenvalues)? Result updates: Following @user8675309's tip, we can show by Levy-Desplanques theorem that the lower $(n - 1) \\times (n - 1)$ submatrix of $(*)$ is non-singular, as it is row diagonally dominant. Thus $\\mathrm{rank}(S) \\geq n - 1$ . But the passage from $n - 1$ to $n$ seems quite difficult.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A proof If $n=1$ , $S=(0)$ is singular. If $n=2$ , $S=\\pmatrix{0&1{+}2i\\\\1{+}2i&0}$ is nonsingular. If $n=3$ , $\\det(S)=-50-10i\\not=0$ . Assume $n\\ge4$ . Modify $S$ as follows. Each modification will not change whether $S$ is singular or not. Each modification will keep $S$ symmetric. For each $k$ from $n-1$ down to $1$ inclusive subtract row $k$ from row $k{+}1$ and then subtract column $k$ from col $k{+}1$ . What is great is $S$ is now tridiagonal except on the first row and first column. $$\\pmatrix{\n0 & 1{+}2i & i & i&\\cdots & i & i \\\\\n1{+}2i & {-}2{-}4i & 2{+}2i & 0&\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\ni & 2{+}2i & {-}4{-}6i & 3{+}3i&\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\ni & 0 & 0 & 0&\\cdots & -2(n{-}2){-}2(n{-}1)i & (n{-}1){+}(n{-}1)i \\\\\ni & 0 & 0 & 0 &\\cdots & (n{-}1){+}(n{-}1)i & {-}2(n{-}1){-}2ni\\\\\n}$$ Subtract $\\frac{-1{+}i}2\\times$ the sum of all other columns from column $1$ .\nThen subtract $\\frac{-1{+}i}2\\times$ the sum of all other rows from row $1$ . $$\\pmatrix{\n1{+}ni & i & 0 & 0&\\cdots & 0 & -n \\\\\ni & {-}2{-}4i & 2{+}2i & 0&\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2{+}2i & {-}4{-}6i & 3{+}3i&\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0&\\cdots & -2(n{-}2){-}2(n{-}1)i & (n{-}1){+}(n{-}1)i \\\\\n{-}n & 0 & 0 & 0 &\\cdots & (n{-}1){+}(n{-}1)i & {-}2(n{-}1){-}2ni\\\\\n}$$ Now all entries of $S$ on row $1$ or column $1$ are $0$ except $5$ of them. Subtract $\\frac{i}{1{+}ni}\\times$ row $1$ from row $2$ .\nThen subtract $\\frac{i}{1{+}ni}\\times$ column $1$ from column $2$ . $$\\pmatrix{\n1{+}ni & 0 & 0 & 0&\\cdots & 0 & -n \\\\\n0 & {-}2{-}4i{+}\\frac1{1{+}ni} & 2{+}2i & 0&\\cdots & 0 &\\frac{ni}{1{+}ni}\\\\\n0 & 2{+}2i & {-}4{-}6i & 3{+}3i&\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0&\\cdots & {-}2(n{-}2){-}2(n{-}1)i & (n{-}1){+}(n{-}1)i\\\\\n{-}n & \\frac{ni}{1{+}ni}& 0 & 0 &\\cdots & (n{-}1){+}(n{-}1)i & {-}2(n{-}1){-}2ni\\\\\n}$$ $2$ entries among those $5$ entries are now $0$ too. Let us show that $S$ is diagonally-dominant, which must be nonsingular. Row $1$ : $\\ |{-}n|<|1+ni|$ . Row $2$ : $\\ |2+2i| +\\left|\\frac{ni}{1{+}ni}\\right|$ $<\\sqrt8 +1 <\\sqrt{20}-\\frac14$ $<|{-}2{-}4i| - \\left|\\frac1{1{+}ni}\\right|$ $\\le\\left|{-}2{-}4i+\\frac1{1{+}ni}\\right|.$ Row $r=3,4,\\cdots, n-1$ : $\\ $ the nonzero elements are $r+ri$ , ${-}2r-2(r+1)i$ and $(r+1)+(r+1)i$ , where $-2r-2(r+1)i$ is on the diagonal. $$\\begin{aligned}\n   &\\quad|r+ri| + |(r+1)+(r+1)i|=(2r+1)\\sqrt2 \\\\\n   &<\\sqrt{8r^2+8r+4}=|{-}2r-2(r+1)i| \n \\end{aligned}$$ Row $n$ : $$\\begin{aligned}\n&\\quad|{-}n|+ \\left|\\frac{ni}{1{+}ni}\\right|+|(n{-}1){+}(n{-}1)i| \\\\\n&< (n+1)+(n{-}1)\\sqrt2\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{3n^2-2n+3+2\\sqrt2(n^2-1)}\\\\\n&< \\sqrt{3n^2-2n+3+3(n^2-1)}\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{8n^2-8n+4-2(n-1)(n-2)}\\\\\n&< \\sqrt{8n^2-8n+4}\\\\\n&= |{-}2(n{-}1){-}2ni|\n\\end{aligned}$$ Hence the original $S$ is nonsingular too. How did I find my proof? The big hint is the problem is an exercise in an introductory textbook to linear algebra. However difficult it is, there should be an elementary solution that is not too fancy.  So I set out to diagonalize $S$ or as much as possible. If diagonalization was too difficult, diagonally-dominant matrices should be appealing. Step 1 was easy. After step 1, almost entries on row $1$ are equal. So any equal quantities are of interest, which is true in more much generality. On the other hand, I had been checking whether other rows are diagonally dominant or not.  Computing the sum of numbers at my hand is a secondary nature to me, even when I did not know it should be helpful beforehand. Viola, the sums of elements in the same row are equal for most rows. $$i+(2+2i)+(-4-6i)+(3+3i)=i+(3+3i)+(-6-8i)+(4+4i)=\\cdots$$ The ideas connected. These equal sums can be used to change the entries on row $1$ to $0$ . Thus step 2 came to light. Step 3 was harder. I couldn't see how one could make row $1$ , $2$ , $n$ diagonally dominant simultaneously. If I eliminated $S[1][2]$ , there would be some nonzero popping up elsewhere not on diagonal, which I thought was unlikely to be progress. I decided to try the simple step $3$ after I had succeeded in a messier approach found with some exhaustive search with my program in Python. To my delight, it worked obviously!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original problem carefully and identify all the assumptions.\n\nThe original question is about proving that a specific symmetric complex matrix S is non-singular. The matrix S is defined with entries s_kl where, for l > k, s_kl = k + i l, the diagonal entries are 0, and the matrix is symmetric (so s_kl = s_lk for k > l). The user also mentions some row/column reductions they performed, resulting in a determinant expression (*), and some attempts using the Levy-Desplanques theorem for diagonal dominance in a submatrix.\n\nNow, to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Let's parse the matrix S:\n\n1. S is a symmetric complex matrix.\n2. The diagonal entries of S are zero (s_kk = 0).\n3. For l > k, the (k, l) entry is s_kl = k + i l.\n4. The matrix is constructed such that the lower (n-1)x(n-1) submatrix of the transformed determinant (*) is row diagonally dominant (as per the user's update using Levy-Desplanques theorem).\n5. The problem states that S is of size n x n, but the exact value of n isn't specified beyond being an integer leading to the matrix dimensions.\n\nWait, the matrix size is n x n. The entries go up to 1 + ni in the first row, so n is the dimension. So another assumption is that S is an n x n matrix. But the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on n, like n ≥ 2 or something. But maybe the problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the matrix structure. The user's own steps mention that the lower (n-1)x(n-1) submatrix is diagonally dominant, but that's part of their attempt, not the original problem's assumptions. The original problem's assumptions are about the structure of S.\n\nSo original problem's assumptions:\n\n- S is a symmetric complex matrix.\n- The (k, l) entry of S is s_kl = k + i l for l > k.\n- The diagonal entries s_kk = 0.\n- The matrix S is of size n x n.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove S is non-singular. The user didn't specify any particular conditions on n, except that the matrix is built as described. So in the assumptions, we need to list all the properties given in the problem statement that define the matrix S.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again. The user writes: \"the (k, l) entry of S is s_kl = k + i l if l > k, 0 if l = k, and s_lk if k > l.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n1. S is an n x n matrix.\n2. S is symmetric (since s_kl = s_lk for k > l).\n3. For each pair (k, l) with l > k, s_kl = k + i l.\n4. All diagonal entries of S are zero.\n\nThese are the conditions given in the problem. The user's own steps, like the determinant expression and the diagonal dominance, are part of their attempt, not the original problem's assumptions. So the problem is to prove that this specific matrix S (as defined by those four conditions) is non-singular.\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions should list each of these properties. Let's make sure each is a single line, one property per line.\n\nAssumption:\n- $S$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix.\n- $S$ is symmetric.\n- For $l > k$, the $(k, l)$ entry of $S$ is $s_{kl} = k + il$.\n- The diagonal entries of $S$ are $0$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $S$ is non-singular.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Prove a symmetric complex matrix is non-singular,\" and the question restates that. So the problem is to show S is non-singular given those assumptions.\n\nNow, check if the example provided in the user's instruction matches this structure. In the example, the assumptions are about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo here, similarly, the assumptions are the properties of S, and the problem is to prove it's non-singular.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $S$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix.\n- $S$ is symmetric.\n- For $l > k$, the $(k, l)$ entry of $S$ is $s_{kl} = k + il$.\n- The diagonal entries of $S$ are $0$.\nProblem: Prove that $S$ is non-singular.\n\nI think that's accurate. The problem didn't specify any particular value of n, just that it's an n x n matrix. So all four assumptions are necessary to define the matrix S. The user's own steps and the determinant expression are part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions. Hence, they shouldn't be included in the assumptions section.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those four assumptions and then the problem statement.",
