    "Content": "Let $(X,x_0), (Y,y_0)$ be well-pointed spaces (inclusion of the basepoints is a cofibration). Show the following homotopy equivalence\n$$\n\\Sigma (X\\times Y) \\simeq \\Sigma X \\lor \\Sigma Y \\lor \\Sigma (X\\land Y),\n$$\nwhere $\\Sigma$ means a suspension (or reduced suspension if one prefers since it doesn't matter for well-pointed spaces) and $\\land$ is a smash product .

Edit: I know the homotopy equivalence can be deduced from general theorems on \"homotopy functors\" (I hope that's how they are called in English) from chapter 7.7 in Spanier. But I was told there is an explicit proof and that's the one I'm looking for.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't know how explicit we can go, but I'll give it a try. We have to go first through the homotopy-theoretical part. Since $\\{ * \\} \\subseteq X, \\{ * \\} \\subseteq Y$ are cofibrations, $X \\vee Y \\subseteq X \\times Y$ also is. Let $Z$ be a pointed space and consider the long exact sequence of homotopy for the pair $X \\vee Y \\subseteq X \\times Y$, ie. the sequence $\\ldots \\rightarrow [\\Sigma ^{2}(X \\vee Y), Z] \\rightarrow [\\Sigma(X \\wedge Y), Z] \\rightarrow [\\Sigma(X \\times Y), Z] \\rightarrow [\\Sigma(X \\vee Y), Z] \\rightarrow [X \\wedge Y, Z] \\rightarrow \\ldots$, where $[-,-]$ is the pointed set of homotopy classes of basepoint-preserving maps. Note that for any $n \\geq 0$, $\\Sigma^{n}(X \\vee Y)$ is homeomorphic to $\\Sigma^{n}X \\vee \\Sigma ^{n} Y$. I will not distinguish between the two. Let $k \\geq 1$ and define a map $\\psi ^{k}: \\Sigma^{k}(X \\times Y) \\rightarrow \\Sigma^{k}X \\vee \\Sigma^{k}Y$ $\\psi ^{k} = \\Sigma^{k}(i_{X} \\pi_{X}) + \\Sigma^{k}(i_{Y} \\pi_{Y})$, where $\\pi: X \\times Y \\rightarrow X, Y$ are the projections and $i: X, Y \\rightarrow X \\vee Y$ are the inclusions. Addition is performed via the suspension structure on $\\Sigma^{k}(X \\times Y)$, so this is why we require $k \\geq 1$. (Observe that even though I denote it by addition this is not necessarily commutative for $k=1$.) If $j: X \\vee Y \\hookrightarrow X \\times Y$ is the inclusion, then I claim that $\\psi ^{k}$ is the left inverse to $\\Sigma^{k}j$, ie. $\\psi ^{k} \\circ \\Sigma^{k}j = id_{\\Sigma^{k}(X \\vee Y)}$. This is important because $\\Sigma^{k}j$ are connecting maps in the long exact sequence of homotopy. Indeed, one computes $\\psi ^{k} \\circ (\\Sigma^{k}j) = (\\Sigma^{k}(i_{X} \\pi_{X}) + \\Sigma^{k}(i_{Y} \\pi_{Y})) \\circ \\Sigma^{k}j = \\Sigma^{k}(i_{X} \\pi_{X} j) + \\Sigma^{k}(i_{Y} \\pi _{Y} j)  = \\Sigma^{k}(id_{X} \\vee const) + \\Sigma^{k}(const \\vee id_{Y}) \\simeq (\\Sigma^{k}id_{X} + const) \\vee (const + \\Sigma^{k}id_{Y}) \\simeq \\Sigma^{k}id_{X} \\vee \\Sigma^{k}id_{Y} \\simeq id_{\\Sigma^{k}X \\vee \\Sigma^{k}Y}$. (One can also see this geometrically.) This immediately implies that for all $k \\geq 1$ and all $Z$ the $[\\Sigma^{k}(X \\times Y), Z] \\rightarrow [\\Sigma^{k}(X \\vee Y), Z]$ induced by $j$ is surjective and - by exactness of the long exact sequence - that for all $n \\geq 1$ the map $[\\Sigma^{n}(X \\smash Y), Z] \\rightarrow [\\Sigma^{n}(X \\times Y), Z]$ has zero kernel. In particular, for $k=1$ we have the short exact sequence of groups $0 \\rightarrow [\\Sigma(X \\wedge Y), Z] \\rightarrow [\\Sigma(X \\times Y), Z] \\rightarrow [\\Sigma(X) \\vee \\Sigma(Y), Z] \\rightarrow 0$ Moreover, the map induced by $\\psi^{1}$ splits it and shows that there is a natural isomorphism $\\phi: [\\Sigma(X \\wedge Y), Z] \\rtimes [\\Sigma(X) \\vee \\Sigma(Y), Z] \\rightarrow [\\Sigma(X \\times Y), Z]$, of groups, where the product is only semi-direct, because our groups are not necessarily abelian. This is enough for our purposes, since we also have natural bijections $[\\Sigma(X \\wedge Y), Z] \\rtimes [\\Sigma(X) \\vee \\Sigma(Y), Z] \\simeq [\\Sigma(X \\wedge Y), Z] \\times [\\Sigma(X) \\vee \\Sigma(Y), Z] \\simeq [\\Sigma(X \\wedge Y) \\vee \\Sigma(X) \\vee \\Sigma(Y), Z]$. (The second one follows from from the fact that $\\vee$ is the direct sum in the category of pointed spaces.) Yoneda lemma establishes that there is an isomorphism $\\theta: \\Sigma(X \\times Y) \\rightarrow _{\\simeq} \\Sigma(X \\smash Y) \\vee \\Sigma(X) \\vee \\Sigma(Y) $ in the homotopy category of pointed spaces, ie. a homotopy equivalence that we were after. It takes a little bookkeeping in the above Yoneda-lemma argumentation to see that such map is given by $\\theta = \\Sigma(p) + \\psi^{i} = \\Sigma(p) + \\Sigma^{1}(i_{X} \\pi_{X}) + \\Sigma^{1}(i_{Y} \\pi_{Y})$, where $p: X \\times Y \\rightarrow X \\wedge Y$ is the natural projection. (This is what we get if we start with $id \\in [\\Sigma(X \\wedge Y) \\vee \\Sigma(X) \\vee \\Sigma(Y), \\Sigma(X \\wedge Y) \\vee \\Sigma(X) \\vee \\Sigma(Y)]$ and trace it back by all the bijections above to $[\\Sigma(X \\times Y), \\Sigma(X \\wedge Y) \\vee \\Sigma(X) \\vee \\Sigma(Y)]$ - and this is the way to discover the isomorphisms \"hidden\" by Yoneda lemma.) I understand that my exposition is far from perfect, but if you would like me to go into more detail over some parts, please comment.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the task is to show that the suspension of the product space X×Y is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of the suspensions of X, Y, and their smash product. The given spaces are well-pointed, meaning the basepoint inclusions are cofibrations. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some definitions. The suspension ΣZ of a space Z is basically the quotient of Z×I (where I is the interval [0,1]) with both ends collapsed to a point. For reduced suspension, which is often used when dealing with pointed spaces, we take the smash product of Z with the circle S^1, so ΣZ = Z ∧ S^1. Since the spaces are well-pointed, reduced and unreduced suspensions should be homotopy equivalent here, so maybe that simplifies things.\n\nThe wedge sum ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) is the space obtained by taking the three suspensions and gluing them together at their basepoints. The smash product X∧Y is the quotient of X×Y where the product of the basepoints (x0,y0) is identified to a single point, so it's like collapsing a subspace.\n\nThe user mentioned that ΣX ∨ ΣY is a subspace of Σ(X×Y). Let me visualize that. If I take X×Y and suspend it, then Σ(X×Y) is (X×Y×I)/(X×Y×{0} ∪ X×Y×{1} ∪ {x0}×{y0}×I). Wait, no, reduced suspension would collapse the subspace {x0}×{y0}×I ∪ X×Y×{0,1} to a point. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since Σ(X×Y) is homotopy equivalent to the join of X×Y with S^0, but I might be mixing concepts. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe user wants an explicit proof rather than citing general theorems from Spanier. So, perhaps constructing a specific map between Σ(X×Y) and the wedge sum, and then showing it's a homotopy equivalence.\n\nLet me think about the structure of Σ(X×Y). It's (X×Y×S¹)/(X×Y×{s0} ∪ {x0}×{y0}×S¹), where s0 is the basepoint of S¹. Alternatively, since suspension can be seen as two cones glued along the base. So, C(X×Y) union C(X×Y), where C denotes the cone. Then, when we take the suspension, the two cones are attached along X×Y.\n\nBut how does this relate to the wedge of ΣX, ΣY, and Σ(X∧Y)? Maybe decompose X×Y into parts that correspond to X, Y, and their smash product. For example, the product X×Y can be thought of as the union of X×{y0} ∪ {x0}×Y ∪ (X∧Y), but that's not quite accurate because X∧Y is the quotient of X×Y by collapsing X∨Y. Wait, X∨Y is the subspace X×{y0} ∪ {x0}×Y. So, X×Y is X∨Y union the smash product X∧Y times some interval? Hmm, not exactly. Maybe using the fact that when you suspend a product, you can split it into the suspension of the wedge and the suspension of the smash product?\n\nAlternatively, consider the cofiber sequences. Since the spaces are well-pointed, the inclusions X∨Y → X×Y is a cofibration, and the quotient is X∧Y. So, there's a cofiber sequence X∨Y → X×Y → X∧Y. Suspension preserves cofiber sequences, so applying Σ to this sequence, we get Σ(X∨Y) → Σ(X×Y) → Σ(X∧Y). But Σ(X∨Y) is homotopy equivalent to ΣX ∨ ΣY. Then, the cofiber sequence would imply that Σ(X×Y) is the cofiber of ΣX ∨ ΣY → Σ(X×Y), but maybe that's not directly helpful. Wait, the original cofiber sequence is X∨Y → X×Y → X∧Y. Suspension is a functor, so applying it gives Σ(X∨Y) → Σ(X×Y) → Σ(X∧Y). Since cofiber sequences after suspension should still be cofiber sequences. Then, the cofiber of Σ(X∨Y) → Σ(X×Y) would be Σ(X∧Y). But how does that lead to the desired equivalence? Maybe using the fact that the cofiber sequence splits in some way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps splitting Σ(X×Y) into ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) by considering different parts of the suspension. Let's think about how points in Σ(X×Y) can be represented. A point in Σ(X×Y) is an equivalence class [(x,y,t)] where t is in [0,1], with the appropriate identifications. Maybe we can decompose this into regions where x is near x0, y is near y0, or neither. For example, when t is in [0,1/3], maybe focus on varying X, when t is in [1/3, 2/3], vary Y, and when t is in [2/3,1], vary both? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that Σ(X×Y) is homotopy equivalent to ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y). To construct such a homotopy equivalence, maybe first map Σ(X×Y) to the wedge by collapsing certain subspaces. For example, collapse the suspension of X∨Y inside Σ(X×Y) to the basepoint, which would leave Σ(X∧Y). But then Σ(X×Y)/Σ(X∨Y) is Σ(X∧Y), but that's the cofiber. However, the user wants the wedge sum, so maybe the total space is a combination of ΣX, ΣY, and Σ(X∧Y). Perhaps using the map that pinches the subspaces corresponding to X and Y, and leaves the smash product part.\n\nAlternatively, think about the case when X and Y are spheres. If X=S^m, Y=S^n, then Σ(X×Y) would be S^{m+n+1}, and ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) would be S^{m+1} ∨ S^{n+1} ∨ S^{m+n+1}, which in that case are homotopy equivalent. Wait, but for spheres, the product S^m × S^n has a suspension which is homotopy equivalent to S^{m+1} ∨ S^{n+1} ∨ S^{m+n+1}}. So maybe this is a general version of that.\n\nBut how to generalize that to arbitrary well-pointed spaces. Maybe using the same idea as in the case of spheres. For spheres, the decomposition comes from the fact that S^m × S^n can be decomposed into cells that correspond to the wedge and the smash product. Suspending adds another dimension, hence the higher spheres.\n\nAlternatively, consider the fact that the suspension of a product space can be decomposed using the join operation. The join X * Y is homotopy equivalent to Σ(X ∧ Y). But Σ(X × Y) is homotopy equivalent to ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ (X * Y). Wait, that might be the case. Since the join X*Y is Σ(X ∧ Y). So Σ(X × Y) ≃ ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X ∧ Y). That would align with the problem statement. So maybe the key is to show that the suspension of the product decomposes into the wedge of the individual suspensions and the suspension of the smash product.\n\nBut how to construct such a homotopy equivalence explicitly? Maybe by defining maps back and forth and showing they are homotopy inverses.\n\nAnother approach: Use the homotopy equivalence between Σ(X × Y) and ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X ∧ Y) by analyzing the attaching maps. Since X and Y are well-pointed, their basepoints are non-degenerate, which helps in constructing the homotopy equivalences.\n\nAlternatively, think of Σ(X×Y) as the union of two cones: C_+(X×Y) and C_-(X×Y), each homeomorphic to the cone over X×Y, glued along X×Y. Then, perhaps decompose each cone into parts that correspond to X, Y, and X∧Y. For example, in C_+(X×Y), we can have points [x,y,t] where t is in [0,1]. Maybe separate the cone into regions where x is near x0, y is near y0, or both. Then, collapsing the regions where x or y is at the basepoint would give ΣX, ΣY, and the remaining part would give Σ(X∧Y).\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the product X×Y can be written as the homotopy pushout of X ∨ Y → X × Y ← X ∧ Y, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the map from Σ(X×Y) to ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) that collapses certain subspaces. For instance, collapsing the suspension of X∨Y inside Σ(X×Y) would give a map to Σ(X∧Y), but then we also have the natural inclusions of ΣX and ΣY into Σ(X×Y). So maybe the combined map is ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) → Σ(X×Y), and then we need to show that this map is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, using the Freudenthal suspension theorem, but that applies to connectivity and might not be directly helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that for well-pointed spaces, the reduced suspension is homotopy equivalent to the unreduced suspension. So, we can work with reduced suspensions. Then, the reduced suspension Σ(X×Y) is (X×Y×I)/( (X×Y×{0,1}) ∪ ({x0}×Y×I) ∪ (X×{y0}×I) ). Wait, no, the reduced suspension would collapse the subspace {x0}×{y0}×I ∪ X×Y×{0,1}. Wait, actually, the reduced suspension is the smash product with S^1, so ΣZ = Z ∧ S^1. Then, Σ(X×Y) = (X×Y) ∧ S^1 = X ∧ Y ∧ S^1. But that's not quite right. Wait, no: the reduced suspension ΣZ is Z ∧ S^1. So Σ(X×Y) = (X×Y) ∧ S^1. On the other hand, ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) is (X ∧ S^1) ∨ (Y ∧ S^1) ∨ (X ∧ Y ∧ S^1). So, maybe the equivalence comes from distributing the smash product over the wedge? But smash product doesn't distribute over wedge in general, but here we have a combination of smash and wedge.\n\nAlternatively, there is a natural map from Σ(X×Y) to ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) by using the projections X×Y → X and X×Y → Y, which would induce maps on the suspensions. Then, also considering the quotient map X×Y → X∧Y, which would induce a map on the suspension. Combining these maps might give the desired equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that Σ(X×Y) can be viewed as the union of ΣX × Y and X × ΣY, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because Σ(X×Y) is not the same as ΣX × ΣY.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the suspension of a product is homotopy equivalent to the join of the suspensions. But I think the join of ΣX and ΣY would be different.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me look back at the problem. The user mentions that ΣX ∨ ΣY is a subspace of Σ(X×Y), but they want to see how Σ(X∧Y) comes into play. So, perhaps when you have Σ(X×Y), you can decompose it into ΣX, ΣY, and another part which is Σ(X∧Y). The idea might be similar to the decomposition of the suspension of a wedge versus the suspension of a product.\n\nAlternatively, consider the case where X and Y are both intervals. Then X×Y would be a square, and suspending that would give something like a 3-sphere, but the wedge of ΣX, ΣY, and Σ(X∧Y) would be three circles wedged together. Wait, no, maybe not. If X and Y are intervals with basepoints at 0, then X∧Y would be the square with the axes collapsed, which is a sphere. Suspending that would be a higher sphere. But perhaps in this simple case, the homotopy equivalence holds.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the suspension of a space Z is a homotopy pushout of the diagram * ← Z → *. Then, the suspension of X×Y would be the homotopy pushout of * ← X×Y → *. But how does that relate to the wedge of suspensions?\n\nMaybe using the property that the homotopy pushout of a product can be expressed as the wedge of homotopy pushouts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the James reduced product model for the suspension, but I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that for cofibrant spaces, the suspension functor preserves homotopy colimits. Since X and Y are well-pointed, their product is also cofibrant. Then, perhaps the suspension of the product can be expressed as the homotopy colimit of the suspensions of the components. But homotopy colimits might relate to wedge sums.\n\nAlternatively, consider the cross product in homology. If we can show that the homology groups of Σ(X×Y) and ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) are isomorphic, that might help, but the problem is about homotopy equivalence, which is stronger.\n\nAlternatively, use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. If we can decompose Σ(X×Y) into parts that correspond to ΣX, ΣY, and Σ(X∧Y), then Mayer-Vietoris might show the isomorphism, but again, homotopy equivalence is needed.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the spaces are CW complexes (since well-pointed spaces are cofibrant, and perhaps we can assume they are CW). Then, construct a cellular homotopy equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, think of Σ(X×Y) as a quotient space and define explicit maps to and from the wedge sum. For example, define a map f: Σ(X×Y) → ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) by sending certain regions to each wedge summand. For instance, points in Σ(X×Y) where either x or y is at the basepoint would map to ΣX or ΣY, and points where neither is at the basepoint would map to Σ(X∧Y). Then, check that this map is continuous and a homotopy equivalence.\n\nConversely, define a map g: ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) → Σ(X×Y) by including each wedge summand into Σ(X×Y). For example, map ΣX into Σ(X×Y) by fixing y=y0, map ΣY similarly, and map Σ(X∧Y) by considering the quotient X∧Y in X×Y. Then, show that the composition of f and g is homotopic to the identity, and vice versa.\n\nThis seems plausible. To make it explicit, you need to define these maps carefully. For instance, in Σ(X×Y), which is (X×Y×I)/(basepoint identifications), a point can be represented as (x,y,t). The map f could send:\n\n- If x = x0, then send to ΣY by mapping (x0,y,t) to (y,t) in ΣY.\n- If y = y0, then send to ΣX by mapping (x,y0,t) to (x,t) in ΣX.\n- Otherwise, send to Σ(X∧Y) by collapsing X∨Y and mapping the resulting (x,y,t) in X∧Y×I to Σ(X∧Y).\n\nBut I need to ensure continuity. When x approaches x0 or y approaches y0, the map should transition smoothly into the respective wedge components. This might require a partition of unity or a parameterization that blends these cases.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the quotient map X×Y → X∧Y induces a map on suspensions Σ(X×Y) → Σ(X∧Y). Combining this with the inclusions of ΣX and ΣY into Σ(X×Y), we get a map from ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) to Σ(X×Y). Then, show that this map is a homotopy equivalence by checking that it induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, using the long exact sequence or other tools.\n\nAlternatively, use the Puppe sequence. Since there's a cofiber sequence X∨Y → X×Y → X∧Y, suspending gives Σ(X∨Y) → Σ(X×Y) → Σ(X∧Y). The cofiber of Σ(X∨Y) → Σ(X×Y) is Σ(X∧Y). But also, Σ(X∨Y) is ΣX ∨ ΣY. So, the cofiber sequence becomes ΣX ∨ ΣY → Σ(X×Y) → Σ(X∧Y). In Puppe sequences, iterating cofiber sequences gives a long sequence, but I'm not sure if this directly leads to the desired equivalence.\n\nWait, if there's a cofiber sequence A → B → C, then B is homotopy equivalent to the cofiber of A → B, but in this case, the cofiber of ΣX ∨ ΣY → Σ(X×Y) is Σ(X∧Y). So, this would imply that Σ(X×Y) is the cofiber of ΣX ∨ ΣY → Σ(X×Y), which is trivial. Maybe I'm not using the Puppe sequence correctly here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the cofiber sequence X∨Y → X×Y → X∧Y induces a fibration after applying suspension, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Use the fact that the suspension of a product is homotopy equivalent to the join of the suspensions. The join ΣX * ΣY is homotopy equivalent to Σ(X ∧ Y) * S^1, but I don't know.\n\nWait, let's think about the homotopy equivalence explicitly. Suppose we define a map from Σ(X×Y) to ΣX ∨ ΣY ∨ Σ(X∧Y) by breaking the suspension parameter t into regions. For example, for t in [0,1/3], map to ΣX by projecting onto X and scaling t; for t in [1/3,2/3], map to Σ(X∧Y) by collapsing X∨Y and scaling t; for t in [2/3,1], map to ΣY by projecting onto Y and scaling t. However, this might not be continuous at the boundaries between regions. Alternatively, use a more continuous partition, overlapping the regions.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in Σ(X×Y), we can represent points as triples (x,y,t) where t is the suspension parameter. Define a map that, depending on the values of x, y, and t, sends the point to one of the wedge summands. For instance, if x is not the basepoint and y is not the basepoint, send to Σ(X∧Y). If x is the basepoint, send to ΣY, and if y is the basepoint, send to ΣX. However, this needs to handle overlaps and ensure continuity.\n\nThis approach might work if the subspaces where x or y is the basepoint are closed and the map is defined piecewise but continuous. Since the spaces are well-pointed, the inclusions of the basepoints are cofibrations, which means they have neighborhoods that retract, helping with the continuity of such maps.\n\nOnce the map is defined, we need to show it's a homotopy equivalence. This could be done by showing that it induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups. Alternatively, construct an explicit homotopy inverse.\n\nAnother angle: Use the fact that the smash product X∧Y is the quotient of X×Y by X∨Y. So, Σ(X×Y) is the suspension of the union of X∨Y and the smash product. Since suspension is a homotopy functor, it preserves quotients up to homotopy. Therefore, Σ(X×Y) is homotopy equivalent to the suspension of the wedge X∨Y union something related to the smash product. But how exactly?\n\nWait, there's a homotopy pushout diagram:\n\nX∨Y → X×Y\n\n↓      ↓\n\n*    → X∧Y\n\nSuspending this diagram gives:\n\nΣ(X∨Y) → Σ(X×Y)\n\n↓        ↓\n\nΣ*     → Σ(X∧Y)\n\nBut Σ* is just S^1. However, homotopy pushouts of suspensions are the suspensions of homotopy pushouts. So the suspension of the original pushout (which is X∧Y) becomes the pushout of the suspended spaces. Therefore, the homotopy pushout of Σ(X∨Y) → Σ(X×Y) ← Σ* would be Σ(X∧Y). But this might relate to the decomposition we're looking for.\n\nAlternatively, the homotopy pushout of ΣX ∨ ΣY → Σ(X×Y) ← S^1 might be Σ(X∧Y). But I'm not sure how this helps in showing the homotopy equivalence to the wedge sum.\n\nPerhaps instead of thinking in terms of pushouts, think of splitting Σ(X×Y) using retractions. Since X and Y are well-pointed, there are retractions of their basepoint neighborhoods. Maybe use these to retract parts of Σ(X×Y) onto ΣX, ΣY, and the remaining part onto Σ(X∧Y).\n\nAnother approach inspired by the example of spheres: In the case of spheres, the decomposition arises from the fact that the product of two spheres is a CW complex with cells corresponding to the wedge and the smash product. Suspending adds a cell, leading to the wedge of the suspensions. For general spaces, maybe use a similar cellular decomposition, assuming X and Y are CW complexes (which they can be since they're well-pointed and cofibrant). Then, the product X×Y has a CW structure with cells being products of cells from X and Y. Suspending this would add a cell in the suspension direction. Then, the suspension would have cells corresponding to ΣX, ΣY, and Σ(X∧Y), leading to the homotopy equivalence.\n\nBut this requires knowing that the suspension of the product CW complex decomposes into the wedge of the individual suspensions and the suspension of the smash product. This might be a standard result in homotopy theory, but the user wants an explicit proof.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the reduced suspension is left adjoint to the loop space functor in the homotopy category. But I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nWait, here's a possible explicit construction. The suspension Σ(X×Y) can be viewed as two cones over X×Y glued along X×Y. Let's denote them as C_+ and C_-. Now, each cone can be decomposed into parts:\n\n- In C_+, consider the subspaces where either x is at the basepoint x0, y is at y0, or neither. Similarly for C_-.\n\nThen, collapsing the subspaces where x is at x0 or y is at y0 in each cone would result in ΣX, ΣY, and Σ(X∧Y). For example, collapsing all points in C_+ where x=x0 gives a copy of ΣY, and collapsing points where y=y0 gives ΣX. The remaining part, where neither x nor y is at the basepoint, would form Σ(X∧Y). Similarly for C_-. But since we are gluing C_+ and C_- along X×Y, which is collapsed at the basepoints, the overall result might be the wedge sum of ΣX, ΣY, and Σ(X∧Y).\n\nTo make this precise, define a quotient map that collapses the appropriate subspaces in each cone to the corresponding suspensions. Then, show that this quotient map is a homotopy equivalence by constructing an inverse map that embeds each wedge summand into Σ(X×Y).\n\nAlternatively, think of Σ(X×Y) as the union of the two cones, each of which can be mapped to ΣX, ΣY, and Σ(X∧Y). The key would be to show that these maps can be combined into a map to the wedge sum and that this map is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nThis line of reasoning seems plausible, but it's quite involved. To make it explicit, one would need to carefully define the maps and verify their continuity and homotopy properties. Given that the user is looking for an explicit proof rather than citing general theorems, this approach might be the way to go.\n\nIn summary, the main idea is to decompose the suspension of the product into parts corresponding to the suspensions of X, Y, and their smash product by collapsing appropriate subspaces and showing that the resulting map is a homotopy equivalence.
