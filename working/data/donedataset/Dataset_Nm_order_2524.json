    "Content": "A Farey sequence of order $n$ is a list of the rational numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive whose denominator is less than or equal to $n$. For example $F_6= \\{0,1/6,1/5,1/4,1/3,2/5,1/2,3/5,2/3,3/4,4/5,5/6,1\\}$. The consecutive differences of $F_6$ are $S_6=\\{1/6, 1/30, 1/20, 1/12, 1/15, 1/10, 1/10, 1/15, 1/12, 1/20, 1/30, 1/6\\}$, and the sum of squares of the elements of $S_6$,  $\\displaystyle T_6=\\sum_{i\\in S_6}i^2 = \\frac{19}{180}$. It appears that the sum of squares $T_n$ shrinks a bit faster than $O(ln(n)/n^2)$ but I cannot see how to prove it.  I'd also be interested in considering higher powers than the square, and the differences between every other element, or every third, etc.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Actually, we can do it for higher powers as well.  Let $F_k (N)$ denote the sum of the $k^{th}$ powers of the differences in the Farey sequence.  Then it is easy to see that $$F_0(N)=\\sum_{n=1}^N \\phi(n)\\sim \\frac{3N^2}{\\pi^2}$$ and $$F_1(N)=1.$$  It seems you are looking for $F_2 (N)$, and, you are correct that the asymptotic is $\\frac{\\log N}{N^2}$.  More precisely we have:  $$F_{2}(N)=\\frac{12}{\\pi^{2}N^{2}}\\left(\\log N+\\frac{1}{2}+\\gamma-\\frac{\\zeta'(2)}{\\zeta(2)}\\right)+O\\left(\\frac{\\log^{2}N}{N^{3}}\\right).$$ For $k\\geq 3$, we the log disappears, and we have $$F_{k}(N)=\\frac{2\\zeta(k-1)}{\\zeta(k)N^{k}}+O\\left(\\frac{\\log N}{N^{k+1}}\\right).$$ \n(The error can be improved by a log when $k\\geq 4$) Hope that helps, References: R.R. Hall's Paper: A Note on Farey Sequences. Remark: I strongly suggest reading R.R. Hall's paper since it has the complete proofs, and covers other cases such as negative powers.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is about finding the sum of the squares of the differences of consecutive elements in a Farey sequence. The question provides an example with F_6, showing the consecutive differences S_6 and the sum of their squares T_6 = 19/180. The user mentions that T_n seems to shrink faster than O(ln(n)/n^2) but isn't sure how to prove it. They're also interested in higher powers and differences between every other element, etc.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. The example given by the user had assumptions that were conditions on the variables. Let me parse the original problem for assumptions.\n\nFirst, the Farey sequence of order n is defined as a list of rational numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive with denominators ≤ n. So that's one assumption: \"The Farey sequence of order n consists of all rational numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive with denominator at most n.\"\n\nNext, the problem discusses consecutive differences of the Farey sequence. So the differences are between consecutive elements in F_n. The sum of squares of these differences is T_n. The user is asking about the rate at which T_n shrinks, specifically conjecturing it's faster than O(ln(n)/n^2).\n\nHowever, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were properties of variables in the problem. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be the definitions and conditions given in the problem.\n\nLooking back, the Farey sequence F_n has specific properties: elements between 0 and 1, denominators ≤ n, and they are listed in order. The consecutive differences are the differences between each pair of adjacent elements in F_n. The problem is to consider the sum of the squares of these differences, T_n, and analyze its asymptotic behavior compared to ln(n)/n².\n\nSo, the assumptions would include:\n\n1. F_n is a Farey sequence of order n.\n2. F_n consists of all rational numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive with denominator at most n.\n3. The elements of F_n are ordered in increasing order.\n4. S_n is the set of consecutive differences of F_n.\n5. T_n is the sum of the squares of the elements in S_n.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions were more about conditions applied to the variables. Here, the problem is more about definitions. But perhaps the user's example was a specific case where assumptions were conditions (like n divisible by 7). In the current problem, maybe the assumptions are the definitions of Farey sequence, consecutive differences, and T_n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the standard definitions. The problem as stated is to analyze the asymptotic behavior of T_n, given that T_n is the sum of squares of consecutive differences in the Farey sequence.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an expression A(n) and an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the Farey sequence is defined, and the problem is about the sum of squares of consecutive differences. So maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- F_n is the Farey sequence of order n.\n- S_n is the set of consecutive differences of F_n.\n- T_n is the sum of the squares of the elements of S_n.\n\nBut the user might want each assumption to address only one property. Let's break them down line by line.\n\n1. F_n is a Farey sequence of order n.\n2. F_n contains all rational numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive with denominator at most n.\n3. The elements of F_n are arranged in increasing order.\n4. S_n is the sequence of consecutive differences between elements of F_n.\n5. T_n is defined as the sum of the squares of the elements of S_n.\n\nBut perhaps some of these can be combined or need to be separate. The problem is asking about the sum T_n and its asymptotic behavior. The original problem mentions that T_n seems to shrink faster than O(ln(n)/n²) but can't prove it, and also is interested in higher powers and differences between every other element, etc. However, the formatted problem should only include the main problem and its assumptions. The additional considerations (higher powers, every other element) might be extra parts of the question but not part of the core problem to structure here.\n\nSo the main problem is to determine the asymptotic behavior of T_n, specifically showing that it shrinks faster than O(ln(n)/n²). Therefore, the problem statement would be: \"Determine the asymptotic behavior of T_n and prove that it shrinks faster than O(ln(n)/n²).\"\n\nBut the user's example formatted the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, perhaps the problem is \"Prove that the sum of squares of the consecutive differences in the Farey sequence of order n shrinks faster than O(ln(n)/n²).\" However, the original question says \"It appears that the sum of squares T_n shrinks a bit faster than O(ln(n)/n²) but I cannot see how to prove it.\" So the problem is to prove that T_n is o(ln(n)/n²), or perhaps O(1/n²) or something similar.\n\nBut the exact problem as posed is: \"I'd be interested in considering higher powers than the square, and the differences between every other element, etc.\" But the main problem is about the sum of squares. So the formatted problem should focus on the sum of squares.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- F_n is the Farey sequence of order n.\n- The elements of F_n are arranged in increasing order.\n- S_n is the sequence of consecutive differences between elements of F_n.\n- T_n is the sum of the squares of the elements in S_n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that T_n shrinks faster than O(ln(n)/n²).\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"the sum of squares of the differences of consecutive elements of a Farey Sequence\". So maybe the assumptions can be more concise.\n\nAlternatively, per the example, the assumptions are specific conditions. Here, the problem is to structure the given question into assumptions and problem. The assumptions are the given conditions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example has a mistake. Wait, in the original example, the problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would not require n to be divisible by 7. Perhaps the example was incorrect, but following the user's example, perhaps they made a mistake. Therefore, maybe the user's example was wrong, but we have to follow their structure.\n\nWait, the user's example might be their own, possibly with an error. Let's see:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes n not divisible by 7. However, in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But perhaps the original problem had a typo, or maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated info. Alternatively, perhaps the user is showing that they want to split the problem into assumptions and problem, even if the original problem's assumptions are not all explicit.\n\nIn any case, following the user's instruction to structure the problem as per their example, we need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the Farey sequence problem:\n\nThe original problem defines F_n as the Farey sequence of order n, which is a list of rationals between 0 and 1 with denominator ≤n. Then S_n is the consecutive differences, and T_n is the sum of squares of S_n. The problem is to prove that T_n shrinks faster than O(ln(n)/n²).\n\nSo the assumptions would be the definitions:\n\n- F_n is the Farey sequence of order n.\n- F_n contains all rational numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive with denominator at most n.\n- The elements of F_n are ordered increasingly.\n- S_n is the set of consecutive differences between elements of F_n.\n- T_n is the sum of the squares of the elements of S_n.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property. Let's see:\n\nAssumption:\n- F_n is the Farey sequence of order n.\n- F_n consists of all rational numbers between 0 and 1 with denominator ≤ n.\n- The elements of F_n are arranged in increasing order.\n- S_n is the sequence of consecutive differences of elements in F_n.\n- T_n is the sum of the squares of the elements in S_n.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine the asymptotic behavior of T_n and prove that it shrinks faster than O(ln(n)/n²).\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem says \"It appears that the sum of squares T_n shrinks a bit faster than O(ln(n)/n²) but I cannot see how to prove it.\" So the problem is to prove that T_n is o(ln(n)/n²), i.e., T_n / (ln(n)/n²) → 0 as n → ∞.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement should be as the user phrased it: \"Prove that the sum of squares of the differences of consecutive elements of a Farey sequence shrinks faster than O(ln(n)/n²).\"\n\nHowever, in the example, the problem was restated concisely. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum of squares of the consecutive differences in the Farey sequence of order n, T_n, shrinks faster than O(ln(n)/n²).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nF_n is the Farey sequence of order n,\nF_n consists of all rational numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive with denominators at most n,\nThe elements of F_n are arranged in increasing order,\nS_n is the sequence of consecutive differences between elements of F_n,\nT_n is the sum of the squares of the elements of S_n.\nProblem:\nProve that T_n shrinks faster than \\( O\\left( \\frac{\\ln n}{n^2} \\right) \\).\n###\n\nBut to check against the user's example, their example had a problem where the original was to prove for every integer n, A(n) divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. So maybe the user's example had a mistake. But regardless, we should follow the user's instruction to list assumptions as per the problem's original conditions.\n\nIn the Farey sequence problem, the assumptions are the definitions of F_n, S_n, and T_n. So each line is a separate assumption about one object. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions as such.",
