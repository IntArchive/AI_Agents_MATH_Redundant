    "Content": "It is a theorem in basic representation theory that the degree of an irreducible representation on $G$ over $\\mathbb{C}$ divides the order of $G$.  The usual proof of this fact involves algebraic integers (see for example Fulton & Harris' Representation Theory , Serre's Linear representations of finite groups , or Simon's Representations of finite and compact groups ).  However I find this proof somewhat unsatisfying precisely because it uses algebraic integers, which don't show up much elsewhere in basic representation theory, and it is not at all evident why algebraic integers should be used.  I feel that there has to be another proof of this theorem that uses techniques of group theory and representation theory, but the only other proof I know is one by Kopp and Wiltshire-Gordon , but that proof seems to use even more complicated ideas if not machinery! What are some other proofs of this theorem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It seems to me that Etingof et al (pages 51-52) and Kopp and Wiltshire-Gordon give very similar proofs. I'll write them out in as elementary a way as I can, and also give a third proof of my own along similar lines. Notation: Let $G$ be our finite group, $V$ an irrep over the complex numbers, $\\rho_V$ the map $G \\to GL(V)$ and $\\chi_V$ the character of $V$. We write $\\mathrm{Id}_V$ for the identity map $V \\to V$. Let $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_c$ be representatives for the conjugacy classes of $G$, and let $C(g)$ be the conjugacy class of $g$. Lemma: For any $g \\in G$,\n$$\\sum_{h \\in C(g)} \\rho_V(h) = \\frac{|C(g)| \\chi_V(g)}{\\dim V} \\mathrm{Id}_V \\quad\\quad (\\ast)$$ Proof: For any $f$ in $G$, we have\n$$\\rho_V(f) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{h \\in C(g)} \\rho_V(h) \\right) = \\sum_{h \\in C(g)} \\rho_V(fh) =$$\n$$\\left( \\sum_{h \\in C(g)} \\rho_V(fhf^{-1}) \\right) \\cdot \\rho_V(f) = \\left( \\sum_{h \\in C(g)}  \\rho_V(h) \\right) \\cdot \\rho_V(f).$$ So the left hand side of $(\\ast)$ commutes with every $\\rho_V(f)$. By Schur's lemma, this means that the left hand side of $(\\ast)$ is $a \\mathrm{Id}_V$ for some scalar $a$. Taking traces, we compute that $|C(g)| \\chi_V(g) = a \\dim V$, so $a = |C(g)| \\chi_V(g)/\\dim V$ as required. $\\square$ Let's define \n$$P(g) = \\sum_{h \\in C(g)} h.$$\nThis is an element in $\\mathbb{Z}[G]$. Let \n$$P_V(g) = \\sum_{h \\in C(g)} \\rho_V(h).$$\nThis is how $P(g)$ acts on $V$. So the above Lemma shows that $P_V(g) = |C(g)| \\chi_V(g)/ \\dim V \\cdot \\mathrm{Id}_V$. Both the papers I cite want to sum up $P_V(g_i)$ in some way, use the identity $$\\sum_{i} |C(g_i)| \\chi_V(g_i) \\chi_V(g_i^{-1}) = |G| \\quad \\quad (\\ast \\ast)$$  and wind up with $\\dim V$ in the denominator of something which they can prove, by other means, is an integer. Note that you may recognize $(\\ast \\ast)$ better in the form $\\sum_{g \\in G} \\chi_V(g) \\overline{\\chi_V(g)} = |G|$; we get identity $(\\ast \\ast)$ by grouping together the terms in the same conjugacy class and using $\\chi_V(g^{-1}) = \\overline{\\chi_V(g)}$. Etingof et al's proof: Consider\n$$Q_V = \\sum_i P_V(g_i) \\chi_V(g_i^{-1}).$$\nOn the one hand, using the Lemma,\n$$Q_V = \\sum_i |C(g_i)| \\chi_V(g_i) \\chi_V(g_i^{-1}) \\frac{1}{\\dim V} \\mathrm{Id}_V = \\frac{|G|}{\\dim V} \\mathrm{Id}_V$$\nusing $(\\ast\\ast)$. On the other hand if you expand out $Q_V$ in $\\mathbb{C}[G]$, you'll see that the coefficient of every group element is an algebraic integer. So $|G|/\\dim V$ is an algebraic integer and, since it is rational, must be an integer. $\\square$. Kopp and Wiltshire-Gordon's proof: Set\n$$R = \\sum_{i} \\frac{|G|}{|C(g)|} P(g_i) P(g_i^{-1}).$$\nLet $R_V = \\rho_V(R)$. Using the Lemma, \n$$R_V = \\sum_i \\frac{|G|}{(\\dim V)^2} |C(g_i)| \\chi_V(g_i) \\chi_V(g_i^{-1}) \\mathrm{Id} = \\frac{|G|^2}{(\\dim V)^2} \\mathrm{Id}_V.$$ So, similarly,\n$$\\rho_V(R^k) = \\frac{|G|^{2k}}{(\\dim V)^{2k}} \\mathrm{Id}_V.$$ Let $U$ be the regular representation of $G$. So $\\chi_U = \\sum (\\dim V) \\chi_V$. We deduce that\n$$\\chi_U(R^k) = \\sum_V (\\dim V) \\frac{|G|^{2k}}{(\\dim V)^{2k}}  \\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathrm{Id}_V) = \\sum_V (\\dim V)^2 \\frac{|G|^{2k}}{(\\dim V)^{2k}}.$$ One the other hand, $R$ is clearly in $\\mathbb{Z}[G]$. (Recall that $|C(g)|$ divides $|G|$ because $|C(g)|$ has a transitive action of $G$ by conjugation.) So $R^k$ is in $\\mathbb{Z}[G]$. And the trace of any element of $\\mathbb{Z}[G]$ acting on the regular rep is an integer (in fact, it is $|G|$ times the coefficient of the identity). So $\\sum_V (\\dim V)^2 \\frac{|G|^{2k}}{(\\dim V)^{2k}}$ is an integer (in fact, one divisible by $|G|$) for all $k$. In Lemma 6.2, the authors show that this forces each $|G|/\\dim V$ to be an integer. $\\square$ Remark Other parts of the paper make use of the pleasant identity $R = \\sum_{g \\in g} \\sum_{h \\in G} ghg^{-1} h^{-1}$. But this doesn't seem to be important if our goal is solely to get this fact. Variant on the second proof If one considers the action of $R$ on $\\mathbb{Z} G$, it is clearly given by a matrix with integer entries. Let $f(\\lambda)$ be the characterisitc polynomial of that matrix, so $f$ is a monic polynomial with rational coefficients. We showed that $R$ acts on the subspace $V^{\\oplus \\dim V}$ of $\\mathbb{C} G$ by $(|G|/\\dim V)^2$. So $(|G|/\\dim V)^2$ is an eigenvalue of the above integer matrix. So $(|G|/\\dim V)^2$ is a root of $f$. By the rational root theorem, we deduce that $(\\dim V)^2$ divides $|G|^2$, so $\\dim V$ divides $|G|$. $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proofs that the degree of an irreducible representation divides the order of the group, and the user is looking for alternative proofs that don't use algebraic integers. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that it's a theorem in basic representation theory. The key elements here are:\n\n1. The group in question is finite since the theorem talks about the order of G.\n2. The representations are over the complex numbers, as specified.\n3. The representations are irreducible.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"the degree of an irrep divides the order of G\". So the assumptions should be about G being a finite group, the representation being irreducible, and over the complex field. The question is asking for different proofs of this theorem, but the user wants the problem structured into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption 1: G is a finite group. (Because the theorem is about the order of G.)\nAssumption 2: The representation is an irreducible representation over the complex numbers (since the theorem is stated over ℂ).\nAssumption 3: The degree of the representation is considered. (Though maybe this is part of the problem statement.)\n\nThe problem is to prove that the degree divides the order of G. The original question is seeking alternative proofs, but in the example provided, the problem is stated as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the problem here is just to \"Prove that the degree of an irreducible representation of G over ℂ divides the order of G,\" with the assumptions being G is a finite group and the representation is irreducible over ℂ.\n\nWait, the example had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition. Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- The representation is an irreducible representation of G.\n- The representation is over the field of complex numbers.\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumptions. The problem is to prove that the degree of such a representation divides the order of G.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nThe representation is an irreducible representation of G,\nThe representation is over the complex numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the degree of the representation divides the order of G.\n\nYes, that seems right. The user in the example didn't include all possible implicit assumptions but focused on the key ones. Here, the key assumptions are that G is finite, the rep is irreducible, and over ℂ. The problem is to prove divisibility of the degree into the group's order.",
