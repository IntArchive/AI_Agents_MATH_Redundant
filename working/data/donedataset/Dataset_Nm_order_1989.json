    "Content": "Let $A$ be an $n\\times n$ matrix ($n=2k$, $k \\in \\Bbb N^*$) such that. $$a_{ij} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\pm 1,  & \\text{if $i \\ne j$} \\\\\n0, & \\text{if $i=j$}\n\\end{cases}$$ Show that $\\det (A) \\ne 0$. P.S. $a_{ij}=\\pm 1$ means that it can be $+1$ or $-1$ not necessarily the same for all $a_{ij}$. My approach: I've started with the definition of $\\det A$ writing like a permutation sum but it became messy. I also tried Laplace's method but also didn't work. I also tried induction but once $\\pm 1$ is aleatory it became tough to deal with.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that $n$ is even. Consider your matrix $A$ as being a matrix with integer coefficient, and let $\\mathbb{F}_2$ be the field with two elements.  Then the projection $\\pi:\\mathbb{Z}\\to \\mathbb{F}_2$ induces a projection $\\pi$ on the rings of matrices; let $A_2$ be the image of $A$ by this projection.  Then $\\det(A_2) = \\pi(\\det(A))$. Now, let $B$ be the matrix defined in the same way as $A$, except that all non-zero entries are $1$ (instead of $\\pm 1$).  Then $\\pi(B)= A_2$.  Now $B$ is a circulant matrix , and we know that its determinant is $(n-1)\\cdot(-1)^n$.  Hence $\\det(A_2)=1$, so $\\det(A)$ cannot be zero (in fact, it cannot be an even number). Note that this also shows that if $n$ is odd, then $\\det(A)$ will always be an even number. Added: After seeing Omnomnomnom's answer, I realized that the matrix $A_2$ above is invertible, and is its own inverse, if $n$ is even.  So there's no need to use the circulant matrix $B$ in the proof. And if $n$ is odd: The result is false if $n$ is odd.  A counter-example for $n=3$ is given by the matrix\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$ If $n$ is any odd integer, then this counter-example generalizes: let $A$ have $1$'s everywhere, except on the diagonal, and also on the last row, where $1$ and $-1$ alternate.  Then $A$ has zero determinant, since the vector $(1,1,\\ldots,1,n-2)^t$ is in its kernel.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and extract the key assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe title mentions proving that the determinant of matrix A is non-zero under certain conditions. The matrix A is n x n where n is 2k, with k a positive integer. The entries of A are such that the diagonal elements are all zero, and the off-diagonal elements are either +1 or -1, not necessarily the same for all entries.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The matrix A is of size n x n. The problem states n = 2k where k is a positive integer. So the first assumption is that n is an even integer (since 2k implies even, and k is in natural numbers starting from 1). So, n is even and n ≥ 2.\n\n2. Each diagonal entry a_{i,i} is 0. So, for all i, a_{i,i} = 0.\n\n3. Each off-diagonal entry a_{i,j} (where i ≠ j) is either +1 or -1. Moreover, the problem mentions that these can vary; they don't have to be the same across the matrix. So, the entries are ±1 independently.\n\nThe problem is to show that the determinant of A is not zero. So, under these assumptions, prove det(A) ≠ 0.\n\nWait, the original question's title says \"Proving that det(A) ≠ 0\", and the problem statement in the question body repeats that. The user's approach mentions permutations, Laplace, and induction but found them messy. \n\nNow, checking for any other assumptions. The user mentions n=2k, k ∈ ℕ^*, which means n is an even positive integer (since k is a positive integer). So, n must be even. That's a key assumption here.\n\nSo, compiling the assumptions line by line:\n\n- A is an n×n matrix where n is an even integer (n = 2k, k ∈ ℕ^*).\n- For each diagonal element a_{i,i} (i = 1 to n), a_{i,i} = 0.\n- For each off-diagonal element a_{i,j} where i ≠ j, a_{i,j} is either +1 or -1 (independently of other entries).\n\nThe problem is to prove that under these conditions, the determinant of A is not zero.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. First assumption: n is an even integer (since n=2k with k ∈ ℕ^*). So, that's one condition on n.\n\n2. Second assumption: each diagonal element is 0. So, applied to matrix A's diagonal entries.\n\n3. Third assumption: each off-diagonal element is ±1. Again, applied to matrix A's off-diagonal entries.\n\nI think that's all. The problem statement is to show determinant non-zero. So formatted accordingly.",
