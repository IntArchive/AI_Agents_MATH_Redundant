    "Content": "This is the Problem 1-6 of John Lee's Introduction to smooth manifold: Let $M$ be a nonempty topological manifold of dimension $n\\geq1$. If $M$ has a smooth structure, show that it has uncountably many distinct ones.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "It took me a while to understand the great idea proposed by Anthony Carapetis since I think that other people may have the same doubt that I had, I decided to write a more detailed answer using his idea. First of all, remember the Proposition $1.17$ (this proposition is straightforward to prove) of John Lee's Introduction to smooth manifold: and note that $F_s: B(0,1) \\rightarrow B(0,1)$ is an homeomorphism that isn't a diffeomorphism $\\forall s>0$ and $s\\neq 1$ , and $F_s: B(0,1)\\setminus \\{0\\} \\rightarrow B(0,1)\\setminus \\{0\\}$ is a smooth diffeomorphism $\\forall s>0$ ( where $B(y,r) = \\{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^n;$ $|x-y|<r$ $\\}$ ). Let $\\mathcal{A} = (\\varphi_i,U_i)_{i \\in I}$ be a smooth atlas of $M$ . We will construct a smooth atlas $\\mathcal{B}$ such that $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B}$ is not a smooth atlas. Note that for every $x$ $\\in$ $M$ , there exists a chart $(\\varphi_x,U_x)$ $\\in$ $\\mathcal{A}$ , satisfying $x$ $\\in$ $U_x$ . Using that $\\varphi(U_x) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ is open, $\\exists$ $\\delta_x >0$ , such that, $B(\\varphi(x), \\delta_x) \\subset \\varphi (U_x)$ . So, we can define a smooth atlas $$\\mathcal{C} = \\left\\{(\\varphi_x, \\varphi^{-1}_x \\left( B(\\varphi(x),\\delta_x) \\right) )\\right\\}_{x \\in M},$$ which has the same smooth structure of $\\mathcal{A}$ . Moreover, note that for every $x\\in M$ , there is a function $\\xi_x : B(\\varphi(x), \\delta_x) \\rightarrow B(0,1)$ such that $\\xi_x $ is a smooth diffeomorphism between $B(\\varphi(x), \\delta_x)$ and $B(0,1)$ (in fact we cand define $\\xi_x(y) = \\frac{1}{\\delta_x}(y-\\varphi(x) )$ ). Consequently, we are able to define a new smooth atlas $$\\mathcal{D} = \\left\\{\\left(\\xi_x \\circ \\varphi_x, \\varphi_x^{-1}\\left(B(\\varphi(x), \\delta_x) \\right)\\right)\\right\\}_{x \\in M},$$ which has the same smooth structure of $\\mathcal{A}$ and $B(0,1) = \\xi_x \\circ \\varphi^{-1}_x(B(\\varphi(x),\\delta_x ))$ , $\\forall$ $x$ $\\in$ $M$ . Now, fixed $x_0$ $\\in$ $M$ , and using that $M$ is Hausdorff, for every $y$ $\\in$ $M$ ( $y$ $\\neq$ $x$ ), exists a neighborhood $V_y$ of $y$ , such that $x$ $\\notin$ $V_y$ . Therefore, $$\\mathcal{E} =  \\left\\{(\\xi_{x_0} \\circ \\varphi_{x_0}, \\varphi_x^{-1}(B(\\varphi(x_0), \\delta_{x_0}) )\\right\\} \\cup  \\left\\{(\\xi_y \\circ \\varphi_y, \\varphi_y^{-1}(B(\\varphi(y), \\delta_y) \\cap V_y )\\right\\}_{y \\in  M\\setminus \\{x_0\\}}$$ is a smooth atlas which has same smooth structure of $\\mathcal{A}$ . So, we can finally use Carapetis' idea. Define $$\\mathcal{B} = \\left\\{(F_s \\circ \\xi_{x_0} \\circ \\varphi_{x_0}, \\varphi_x^{-1}(B(\\varphi(x_0), \\delta_{x_0}) )\\right\\} \\cup \\left\\{ (\\xi_y \\circ \\varphi_y, \\varphi_y^{-1}(B(\\varphi(y), \\delta_y) \\cap V_y )\\right\\}_{y \\in M\\setminus \\{x_0\\}},$$ Now, we need to prove that $\\mathcal{B}$ is a smooth atlas, the only nontrivial property that needs to be checked is: if, $\\forall$ $y$ $\\in$ $M\\setminus \\{x_0\\}$ $$F_s \\circ \\xi_{x_0} \\circ \\varphi_{x_0} \\circ (\\xi_{y} \\circ \\varphi_y)^{-1}: \\xi_y \\circ \\varphi_y (Z_y) \\rightarrow F_s \\circ \\xi_{x_0}\\circ \\varphi_{x_0} (Z_y),  $$ ( where $Z_y = \\left( V_y \\cap  \\varphi_y^{-1}(B(\\varphi(y), \\delta_{y})) \\right) \\cap  \\varphi_{x_0}^{-1}(B(\\varphi(x_0), \\delta_{x_0}))$ ) is a smooth diffeomorphism. This follows directly from the fact that $\\xi_{x_0} \\circ \\varphi_{x_0} \\circ (\\xi_{y} \\circ \\varphi_y)^{-1}$ and $F_s\\vert_{ \\xi_{x_0} \\circ \\varphi_{x_0} \\circ (\\xi_{y} \\circ \\varphi_y)^{-1}(Z_y)}$ are diffeomorphisms, because $0$ $\\notin \\xi_{x_0} \\circ \\varphi_{x_0} \\circ (\\xi_{y} \\circ \\varphi_y)^{-1}(Z_y)$ , sinse $x_0$ $\\notin$ $U_y$ . Then $\\mathcal{B}$ is a smooth atlas, but $\\mathcal{B} \\cup \\mathcal{D}$ isn't a smooth atlas, because $$F_s = F_s \\circ \\xi_{x_0} \\circ \\varphi_{x_0} \\circ ( \\xi_{x_0} \\circ \\varphi_{x_0})^{-1} : B(0,1) \\rightarrow B(0,1) $$ is not a smooth diffeomorphism. Using Proposition 1.17, we conclude that the smooth structure determined by $\\mathcal{B}$ is different of the smooth structure determined by $\\mathcal{A}$ (because of the smooth structure determined by $\\mathcal{A}$ $=$ smooth structure determined by $\\mathcal{D}$ $\\neq$ smooth structure determined by $\\mathcal{B}$ ). Since this result holds for all $s>0$ , we can construct uncountable many differents smooth atlas $\\mathcal{B}$ , which all have different smooth structures among them, which completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from John Lee's book. The question is about showing that a nonempty topological manifold M of dimension n≥1, which already has a smooth structure, must have uncountably many distinct smooth structures. The hint provided involves using the function F_s(x) = |x|^{s-1}x, which is a homeomorphism of the unit ball B^n but only a diffeomorphism when s=1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the user's attempt. They mentioned creating an atlas A that's compact (probably meant to say compatible) with the original smooth structure, where each chart maps to B^n. Then they tried defining new charts by composing with F_s, but ran into an issue where the transition maps might not be smooth. The key problem seems to be ensuring that the transition maps are smooth diffeomorphisms when using these F_s transformations.\n\nThe original problem wants us to show uncountably many distinct smooth structures. Since s can vary over positive real numbers, and F_s is a homeomorphism for any s>0 but diffeo only at s=1, maybe varying s gives different smooth structures. But how exactly?\n\nLet me recall that two smooth structures are considered the same if there's a diffeomorphism between them. So, if we can construct smooth structures via F_s such that for different s, they aren't diffeomorphic, that would give distinct structures. Since s is a positive real parameter, and there are uncountably many s, this could work.\n\nThe user tried modifying charts by composing with F_s. The transition map becomes F_s ∘ φ∘ψ^{-1} ∘ F_s^{-1}. If the original transition map φ∘ψ^{-1} is a diffeomorphism, then composing with F_s and its inverse might break smoothness unless s=1. Wait, but if we apply F_s to both charts, maybe the transition maps would still be smooth? Hmm, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nSuppose we have two charts (U, ψ) and (V, φ) in the original atlas. The transition map is φ∘ψ^{-1}: ψ(U∩V) → φ(U∩V), which is a diffeomorphism. Now, if we define new charts (U, F_s∘ψ) and (V, F_s∘φ), then the new transition map is F_s∘φ∘ψ^{-1}∘F_s^{-1}. For this to be smooth, we need F_s to be compatible in some way. Since F_s is a diffeomorphism only when s=1, otherwise it's just a homeomorphism, the composition might introduce non-smoothness. \n\nWait, but if s is fixed for all charts, then perhaps the transition maps would still work? Let me test with an example. Suppose in the original charts, the transition map is a diffeomorphism f. Then the new transition map would be F_s ∘ f ∘ F_s^{-1}. If f is a diffeomorphism and F_s is a homeomorphism but not a diffeomorphism (for s≠1), then F_s ∘ f ∘ F_s^{-1} might not be smooth. Because even though F_s^{-1} is smooth (since F_s is a homeomorphism and F_s^{-1} would be F_{1/s}?), wait, no. Wait, F_s is defined as |x|^{s-1}x. Let's compute its inverse. Suppose y = F_s(x) = |x|^{s-1}x. Then, solving for x in terms of y: |y| = |x|^{s-1}|x| = |x|^s, so |x| = |y|^{1/s}. Then x = F_{1/s}(y) = |y|^{1/s -1} y. Therefore, F_s^{-1} = F_{1/s}. So, if we have F_s ∘ f ∘ F_{1/s}, but f is a diffeomorphism. However, F_s and F_{1/s} are not diffeomorphisms unless s=1. Therefore, composing a diffeomorphism with non-smooth maps might result in a non-smooth transition map. Hence, the user is correct that the transition maps may not be diffeomorphisms, so their approach might not directly yield a smooth atlas.\n\nSo, perhaps a different approach is needed. Maybe instead of modifying all charts, we modify a single chart and extend it in a way that the transition maps are compatible. For instance, take a point p in M, and a chart around p, modify that chart using F_s, and then see how this affects the smooth structure. If the modification is only in a small neighborhood, perhaps the rest of the manifold can be adjusted accordingly. But this requires more careful handling.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if we have one smooth structure, we can create a new smooth structure by conjugating the charts with F_s in some local coordinates. However, to ensure that this gives a distinct smooth structure for different s, we need to ensure that there's no diffeomorphism between the structures for different s. The fact that F_s is not a diffeomorphism unless s=1 suggests that these structures are different. But how to formalize this?\n\nAnother idea: Use the fact that the smooth structures are determined by the maximal atlas. By modifying the charts via F_s for different s, even though each individual chart modification might not preserve smoothness, perhaps by using a partition of unity or some local modification, we can generate uncountably many atlases that are not compatible with each other. Since s can take uncountably many values, and each s gives a different \"twist\" to the smooth structure, these atlases would represent distinct smooth structures.\n\nBut the problem is to show that there are uncountably many distinct ones. The key here is that the smooth structures are distinct, i.e., not diffeomorphic. To show that, maybe we can argue that the resulting manifolds for different s are not diffeomorphic because the differential structures are incompatible. However, proving that two smooth structures are not diffeomorphic is non-trivial.\n\nWait, but the problem might not require showing that they are pairwise non-diffeomorphic, just that there are uncountably many. Perhaps by using a parameter s in a way that each s gives a different maximal atlas, and since there are uncountably many s, the conclusion follows. However, the problem says \"distinct\" smooth structures, which usually means non-diffeomorphic. So we need to ensure that for different s, the resulting smooth structures are not diffeomorphic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers two smooth structures distinct if their atlases are not compatible. In that case, even if the manifolds are diffeomorphic, the smooth structures could be different. Wait, but in standard terminology, distinct smooth structures usually mean they are not diffeomorphic. Hmm, maybe in this context, the problem is using \"distinct\" in the sense of different maximal atlases, not necessarily non-diffeomorphic. The problem says \"distinct ones\", so perhaps just different, not necessarily non-diffeomorphic. But the standard definition is that two smooth structures are equivalent if there's a diffeomorphism between them. So \"distinct\" would mean not equivalent under diffeomorphism.\n\nBut maybe the problem is from Lee's book, and in the context of the problem, \"distinct\" might just mean different as sets of charts, but the question is likely asking for non-diffeomorphic structures. However, the problem might have a different approach. Let me recall the standard example. For example, on R^4, there are uncountably many exotic smooth structures. But in dimensions less than 4, smooth structures are unique. Wait, but the problem here is for any n≥1. Wait, that's not true. For R^n, except n=4, the smooth structure is unique. But the problem is about a general manifold M. If M is any manifold of dimension ≥1 with at least one smooth structure, then it has uncountably many. Wait, but for example, in dimension 1, all manifolds have a unique smooth structure. Wait, is that the case? In dimension 1, topological manifolds have a unique smooth structure up to diffeomorphism. So maybe the problem has a different approach, or perhaps the dimension is supposed to be ≥1 but the result is only non-trivial for higher dimensions? But the problem states n≥1.\n\nWait, but maybe in the problem, even though for n=1, the smooth structures are unique, the problem still states \"uncountably many\", but perhaps in dimension 1, the construction would actually not work, but the problem includes n≥1. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct because even in dimension 1, you can construct uncountably many smooth structures, but they are all diffeomorphic. So \"distinct\" might not mean non-diffeomorphic, but just different as atlases. However, standard terminology considers smooth structures up to diffeomorphism. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the existence of uncountably many maximal atlases, not up to diffeomorphism. But in that case, even in dimension 1, there are uncountably many smooth atlases, but they are all compatible, hence equivalent. So they would not be distinct smooth structures. So there must be something wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the problem says \"nonempty topological manifold\". If the manifold is empty, the statement is trivial, but nonempty. So for a nonempty M of dimension ≥1, if it has one smooth structure, then it has uncountably many. But for example, in dimension 1, the real line has a unique smooth structure. So how does this reconcile with the problem's claim? Unless the problem is considering \"distinct\" in a different sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, I need to check. In John Lee's book, the problem is stated as: Let M be a nonempty topological manifold of dimension n ≥ 1. If M has a smooth structure, show that it has uncountably many distinct ones. So Lee is asserting that even in dimension 1, if a manifold has a smooth structure, it has uncountably many. But that contradicts the fact that in dimension 1, all smooth structures are equivalent. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding or in the problem's assertion.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the smooth structures are not compatible, but in dimension 1, all smooth structures are compatible. So how can there be uncountably many? This is confusing. Maybe the answer lies in the construction using F_s, which even in dimension 1, by modifying the charts using F_s, you can create atlases that are not compatible, but in dimension 1, they are still diffeomorphic. So even though you have uncountably many atlases, they are all equivalent, hence not distinct in the diffeomorphism sense. But the problem says \"distinct ones\", which probably means distinct in the sense of non-diffeomorphic.\n\nTherefore, there must be something wrong here. Wait, perhaps in higher dimensions, the smooth structures created via F_s are non-diffeomorphic, while in dimension 1 they are diffeomorphic, but since the problem includes n≥1, it's still okay because for n≥2, you can have uncountably many, and for n=1, maybe you can argue they are still distinct as atlases, even if diffeomorphic. But that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the key is that even in dimension 1, you can construct uncountably many smooth structures by modifying the atlas in different ways, and even though they are diffeomorphic, they are considered distinct as smooth structures. But usually, smooth structures are considered up to diffeomorphism. So this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the standard approach to this problem. The standard solution involves using the hint: For each s > 0, define a homeomorphism F_s of B^n which is a diffeomorphism only at s=1. Then, by modifying one chart in the smooth atlas with F_s, you can create a new smooth structure. The idea is that if you take a coordinate neighborhood, change the chart using F_s, and then check that this modification can be extended to a smooth structure on the entire manifold. Since the modification is local and the rest of the manifold remains the same, you can generate different smooth structures.\n\nHowever, to ensure that these structures are distinct, you need to show that for different values of s, the resulting smooth structures are not diffeomorphic. This would require that there's no diffeomorphism of M that conjugates the two different smooth structures. The key is that the map F_s changes the differentiability at the origin, and if two smooth structures differ by such a modification, there can be no diffeomorphism between them because the diffeomorphism would have to smooth out the singularity introduced by F_s, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, even if they are diffeomorphic, the problem might just require showing that there are uncountably many smooth structures in the set-theoretic sense, not up to diffeomorphism. But that would be non-standard terminology. However, given the problem's phrasing, it's likely that \"distinct\" means as smooth structures, i.e., not diffeomorphic.\n\nGiven that, the approach is: Take the given smooth structure, pick a chart, modify it by F_s in some ball, and then use the fact that the resulting smooth structure is non-diffeomorphic for different s. Since s can be any positive real, there are uncountably many such s, hence uncountably many smooth structures.\n\nTo formalize this, here's an outline:\n\n1. Take a smooth chart (U, φ) of M, with φ(U) = B^n.\n2. Define a new chart (U, F_s ∘ φ).\n3. Check that this new chart is smoothly compatible with all other charts outside U, but the transition maps involving U will now involve F_s and F_s^{-1}.\n4. However, since F_s is not a diffeomorphism unless s=1, these transition maps will not be smooth, so the new atlas is not compatible with the original one.\n5. By extending this modified atlas to a maximal atlas, we get a new smooth structure.\n6. Varying s gives different smooth structures, and since s is uncountable, there are uncountably many.\n7. To show they are distinct, assume for contradiction that two structures for s and s' are diffeomorphic, then the diffeomorphism would have to \"smooth out\" the F_s and F_s' maps, which is impossible unless s=s'.\n\nTherefore, the key steps involve modifying a single chart with F_s, showing the resulting atlas is smooth, and then showing that different s lead to non-diffeomorphic structures.\n\nIn the user's attempt, they tried modifying all charts, which led to transition maps that might not be smooth. Instead, modifying just one chart and keeping the rest the same would only affect transition maps involving that chart. But in that case, the transition maps between the modified chart and other charts would involve F_s, which might not be smooth. Hence, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the smooth structure in a way that the changes are localized and compatible.\n\nWait, actually, if you modify a single chart (U, φ) by F_s, then for any other chart (V, ψ) that intersects U, the transition map ψ ∘ (F_s ∘ φ)^{-1} = ψ ∘ φ^{-1} ∘ F_s^{-1}. If ψ ∘ φ^{-1} is a diffeomorphism (from the original smooth structure), then the new transition map is composition of a diffeomorphism with F_s^{-1}. But F_s^{-1} is F_{1/s}, which is not smooth unless s=1. Hence, this transition map would not be smooth, meaning the new chart is not compatible with the original charts. Therefore, modifying just one chart breaks compatibility with the existing atlas.\n\nSo, the problem is how to create a new smooth atlas that is not compatible with the original one, but still smooth. The solution must involve a more careful modification, perhaps using a family of charts whose transition maps are adjusted via F_s in a compatible way.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that any smooth manifold has a coordinate ball, and within that ball, perform a modification using F_s that is supported only within that ball. Then, by using a bump function to transition between the modified chart and the original ones outside the ball, you can create a new smooth structure. However, this might not work because F_s introduces a non-smooth point at the origin.\n\nWait, but F_s is smooth except at the origin. If you modify the chart only in a small neighborhood around a point, and use a bump function to blend it with the original structure, maybe you can create a smooth structure that differs from the original one. However, F_s is not a diffeomorphism except at s=1, so the composite transition maps would still have a problem at the origin.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if you modify the smooth structure in a way that the differential structure at a point is altered, making it impossible to have a diffeomorphism. This is more of a conceptual approach.\n\nAnother angle: Use the concept of exotic spheres. In higher dimensions, there are exotic spheres, which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the standard sphere. However, this requires specific dimensions and constructions. But the problem is for any manifold of dimension ≥1, which suggests a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to use the fact that once you have one smooth structure, you can create others by \"twisting\" the charts using F_s, and these twists can be done in such a way that they are parameterized by s ∈ ℝ^+, leading to uncountably many smooth structures. Even if these structures are diffeomorphic, the problem might just count them as distinct if they are different atlases, but that contradicts standard terminology. Hence, there must be another approach.\n\nLet me refer back to the hint. The hint says F_s is a homeomorphism but not a diffeomorphism unless s=1. So perhaps by defining a new smooth structure where the charts are modified by F_s, which changes the smoothness, making the new atlas incompatible with the original one. Since s can be any positive real, there are uncountably many such atlases, hence uncountably many smooth structures.\n\nBut to make this precise, suppose we take an existing smooth atlas and modify each chart by F_s. If the original transition maps were diffeomorphisms, then the new transition maps would be F_s ∘ φ∘ψ^{-1} ∘ F_s^{-1}. But since F_s is not a diffeomorphism, this composition might not be smooth. Therefore, the modified atlas is not a smooth atlas unless s=1. Hence, this approach fails.\n\nAlternative plan: Instead of modifying all charts, modify a single chart and then show that this forces a new smooth structure. Suppose we have a chart (U, φ) around a point p, with φ(U) = B^n. Define a new chart (U, F_s ∘ φ). Now, this new chart must be compatible with all other charts not intersecting U, but incompatible with those that do. Therefore, to form a new smooth atlas, we need to keep all other charts the same and replace (U, φ) with (U, F_s ∘ φ). However, this single change would make the transition maps with overlapping charts fail to be smooth. Hence, this is not a valid smooth atlas.\n\nThus, the correct method must be more subtle. Perhaps the idea is to take two charts overlapping in a region, modify one of them with F_s, and adjust the other charts accordingly using partitions of unity. But this is vague.\n\nWait, I recall that in differential topology, a technique called \"connected sum\" can be used to modify a manifold, but that's more about changing the manifold itself rather than the smooth structure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following: Take a smooth manifold M and a point p ∈ M. Choose a chart around p, and modify the smooth structure near p using F_s. Because F_s is a homeomorphism, the topological structure remains the same, but the smooth structure is altered. If this alteration can be done in a way that it doesn't affect the smoothness elsewhere, then varying s would give different smooth structures. \n\nTo make this precise, take a coordinate ball around p, say B, and a chart φ: U → B^n where U is the coordinate neighborhood. Define a new smooth structure by replacing φ with F_s ∘ φ on U, and keeping the original smooth structure on M \\ {p}. However, to ensure smoothness on the overlap U \\ {p}, we need the transition maps between the modified chart and the original charts to be smooth. But near p, the map F_s introduces a non-smooth point unless s=1. Therefore, this approach also faces the issue of non-smoothness at p.\n\nAh, but maybe we can use a bump function to interpolate between the original and modified charts. Suppose we modify the chart not on the entire ball, but on a smaller ball inside U, and use a bump function to smoothly transition between F_s and the identity map on the annulus between the smaller ball and the boundary of U. This way, the transition maps would remain smooth because the modification is smoothed out via the bump function. However, F_s is not smooth at the origin, so even with a bump function, the origin remains a point of non-smoothness.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Perhaps another approach is needed. Let me recall the concept of a \"smoothing\" of a topological manifold and the number of smooth structures. For example, in dimensions up to 3, all manifolds have a unique smooth structure. In dimension 4, many manifolds have uncountably many. But the problem states for any n ≥1. \n\nWait, this must be incorrect unless the problem is using a different notion of smooth structure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to \"smooth structures\" in the sense of atlases, not up to diffeomorphism. In that case, even in dimension 1, there are uncountably many atlases, but they are all compatible. So again, they would not be distinct. Therefore, the problem must have a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that if you have at least one smooth structure, you can construct uncountably many by \"parameterizing\" the smooth structure using s in a way that each s gives a different maximal atlas. For example, by taking the given smooth structure and composing each chart with F_s, but as before, this breaks smoothness. However, if we adjust the definition of smooth functions using these new charts, the differentiability would vary with s. \n\nWait, here's an idea: For each s >0, define a new smooth structure where a function f is smooth in the new structure if f ∘ F_s^{-1} is smooth in the original structure. Since F_s is a homeomorphism, this defines a new smooth structure. For different s, these smooth structures are different because the notion of smoothness is altered by F_s. Since F_s and F_t are not diffeomorphisms for s ≠ t, these smooth structures are not compatible. Therefore, each s defines a distinct smooth structure, and since s can be any positive real, there are uncountably many.\n\nYes, this makes sense. For each s, we can define a new smooth structure by declaring the new smooth charts to be F_s composed with the original charts. Since F_s is a homeomorphism, the new charts are homeomorphisms. To check that they form a smooth atlas, consider two charts F_s ∘ φ and F_s ∘ ψ from the original atlas. The transition map is F_s ∘ φ ∘ ψ^{-1} ∘ F_s^{-1}. If the original transition map φ ∘ ψ^{-1} is smooth, then F_s ∘ φ ∘ ψ^{-1} ∘ F_s^{-1} is smooth if and only if F_s is a diffeomorphism, which is only true when s=1. Therefore, this approach only works for s=1, which gives the original smooth structure. For other s, the transition maps are not smooth, so this doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, this approach fails. \n\nAnother angle: Use the fact that the group of homeomorphisms of a manifold is uncountable, and each element of the group can induce a pullback smooth structure. However, if the homeomorphism is not a diffeomorphism, the pullback structure is different. Since there are uncountably many homeomorphisms (even modulo diffeomorphisms), this would give uncountably many smooth structures. But this requires proof that the induced structures are distinct.\n\nIn this problem, the hint suggests using F_s, which are homeomorphisms but not diffeomorphisms. So for each s, we can define a smooth structure by pulling back the original one via F_s. If we can show that these pullbacks are distinct for different s, then we're done.\n\nFormally, suppose we have a smooth structure A. For each s >0, define a new smooth structure A_s consisting of charts (U, F_s ∘ φ) for each chart (U, φ) in A. The transition maps for A_s would be F_s ∘ φ ∘ ψ^{-1} ∘ F_s^{-1}. For this to be smooth, F_s must be a diffeomorphism, which it's not unless s=1. Therefore, A_s is not a smooth atlas except when s=1. Hence, this approach doesn't work.\n\nThe user's attempt tried exactly this and realized the transition maps may not be diffeomorphisms.\n\nSo, what's the correct method? Maybe instead of modifying all charts, modify a single chart in a way that doesn't affect compatibility with other charts. For example, take a chart that covers the entire manifold (if possible), but manifolds generally don't have global charts. Alternatively, take two charts that cover overlapping regions and modify one of them such that the transition maps still work.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the smooth structure is determined locally, so if you can modify the smooth structure on an open subset, you can extend it to the whole manifold. Since the manifold is connected (if it is), this might not work, but if it's disconnected, you can modify each component. But the problem states the manifold is nonempty, not necessarily connected.\n\nWait, the problem allows M to be any nonempty manifold, possibly disconnected. So, take a single coordinate chart around some point, modify it there, and leave the rest of the manifold as is. But as before, the transition maps would fail.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to use the fact that the set of smooth structures forms a sheaf, and by modifying the smooth structure locally, you can create a new global smooth structure. However, this requires that the local modifications are compatible, which again runs into the transition map problem.\n\nI think I need to look up the standard solution to this problem. From what I recall, the standard approach is to use the hint provided: construct for each s >0 a homeomorphism F_s of the ball that is a diffeomorphism iff s=1. Then, take a smooth chart of M, modify it using F_s, and then show that this gives a new smooth structure. Since F_s is not a diffeomorphism for s≠1, the new smooth structure is different from the original one. By varying s, you get uncountably many smooth structures.\n\nHowever, the crucial step is showing that the modified chart actually generates a smooth structure. To do this, you need to ensure that all transition maps involving the modified chart are smooth. But if you modify only one chart, then the transition maps between the modified chart and other charts would involve F_s, which is not smooth. Therefore, the solution must involve modifying all charts in a compatible way.\n\nBut if you modify all charts using F_s, then the transition maps become F_s ∘ φ ∘ ψ^{-1} ∘ F_s^{-1}, which is smooth only if F_s is a diffeomorphism, which it's not. Therefore, this approach also fails.\n\nThe key insight must be that you can modify the smooth structure in a way that is local and does not affect the smoothness of the transition maps outside a small region. Here's a possible method:\n\n1. Choose a point p in M and a chart (U, φ) around p such that φ(p) = 0 and φ(U) = B^n.\n2. Modify the chart on a smaller ball B_ε(0) ⊂ B^n by replacing φ with F_s ∘ φ on B_ε(0), and keeping φ unchanged on U \\ B_ε(0).\n3. Use a bump function to smoothly interpolate between F_s ∘ φ and φ on the annulus B_ε(0) \\ B_{ε/2}(0).\n4. This local modification creates a new smooth structure that differs from the original one only inside B_ε(0).\n5. Since the modification is localized and the bump function ensures smooth transitions, the new atlas is compatible with itself and forms a new smooth structure.\n6. By varying s, we get different smooth structures, and since s is uncountable, there are uncountably many.\n\nHowever, the critical point is whether the modification using F_s and the bump function results in a smooth transition. The issue is that F_s is not smooth at the origin. Even with a bump function, the origin remains a point of non-smoothness. Therefore, this approach might not work.\n\nWait, but if we use the bump function to blend between F_s and the identity map outside B_ε(0), then inside B_{ε/2}(0), we have F_s, and outside B_ε(0), we have the identity. On the annulus, we have a smooth interpolation. However, F_s itself is not smooth at 0, so even with the interpolation, the map is not smooth at 0. Hence, the modified chart is not a smooth chart, so this doesn't work.\n\nThe problem seems to be that F_s introduces a non-smooth point at the origin, which cannot be smoothed out by a bump function. Therefore, the correct approach must avoid modifying the chart at the origin. But F_s is designed to be a homeomorphism that's not a diffeomorphism exactly because of its behavior at the origin.\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe the solution is to recognize that even though the transition maps are not smooth globally, the new atlas is still smooth because the non-smoothness occurs only at a single point, which is measure zero and thus does not affect the smoothness of the manifold. However, differential structures require smoothness everywhere, so a single point of non-smoothness would invalidate the entire atlas.\n\nPerhaps the answer lies in the concept of \"exotic smooth structures\" where a single manifold can have multiple smooth structures. The standard method to construct them involves changing the smooth structure using a so-called \"twisted\" chart that is not smoothly compatible with the original. However, this requires a more involved construction than just applying F_s.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll summarize the key steps based on standard solutions to this problem:\n\n1. Use the given smooth structure to define a chart around a point p with image B^n.\n2. For each s >0, modify this chart by composing with F_s.\n3. Show that this modified chart, when combined with the original charts away from p, forms a new smooth atlas. This requires that the transition maps between the modified chart and the original charts are smooth.\n4. However, as previously discussed, these transition maps involve F_s, which are not diffeomorphisms, leading to non-smoothness. Hence, this approach fails.\n\nThe resolution comes from realizing that you can use the fact that the smooth structure is determined by the smooth functions. By altering the smooth functions via F_s, you can define a new set of smooth functions that are smooth in the new structure but not in the original. Since F_s is a homeomorphism, it preserves the topology, but changes the differential structure.\n\nHere's a precise method:\n\n- Let M be a smooth manifold with atlas A.\n- For each s >0, define a new atlas A_s where each chart (U, φ) in A is replaced by (U, F_s ∘ φ).\n- Check that A_s is a smooth atlas: For two charts (U, F_s ∘ φ) and (V, F_s ∘ ψ) in A_s, the transition map is F_s ∘ ψ^{-1} ∘ F_s^{-1} ∘ F_s ∘ φ = F_s ∘ (ψ^{-1} ∘ φ) ∘ F_s^{-1}.\n- If the original transition map ψ^{-1} ∘ φ is a diffeomorphism, then the new transition map is F_s ∘ (diffeomorphism) ∘ F_s^{-1}.\n- This is smooth if and only if F_s is a diffeomorphism, which it's not unless s=1. Therefore, A_s is not a smooth atlas.\n\nThus, this approach fails.\n\nThe correct method must be different. Perhaps the solution is to notice that the smooth structure can be altered by a homeomorphism that is not a diffeomorphism, and such homeomorphisms can be parameterized by s >0. Each such homeomorphism would produce a different smooth structure, and since there are uncountably many s, the result follows.\n\nHowever, this requires that the pullback of the smooth structure by F_s is a different smooth structure. But to pull back via F_s, F_s must be a diffeomorphism, which it's not. Therefore, this is invalid.\n\nAfter extensive research, the correct approach is as follows (from John Lee's solution or standard references):\n\nTake a smooth manifold M. Choose a point p ∈ M and a smooth chart (U, φ) with φ(p) = 0 and φ(U) = B^n. Define a new smooth structure on M by declaring that the only chart around p is (U, F_s ∘ φ), and keeping all other charts the same. However, this doesn't work because the new chart must be compatible with overlapping charts. Instead, the actual solution uses the idea that the smooth structure can be altered in a way that the change is confined to a small neighborhood, and using the fact that the group of homeomorphisms is uncountable.\n\nThe key is to construct a family of smooth structures where each is defined by conjugating the original one with a homeomorphism that is not a diffeomorphism, and showing that these conjugates are distinct smooth structures. Since the homeomorphisms can be parameterized by s ∈ ℝ^+, and there are uncountably many s, this gives the result.\n\nHowever, to make this precise, consider that two smooth structures are the same if there exists a diffeomorphism between them. If we can show that for s ≠ t, there is no diffeomorphism that conjugates the F_s-modified structure to the F_t-modified structure, then they are distinct. The function F_s changes the differentiability properties at the origin, and a diffeomorphism would need to preserve these properties, which is impossible unless s=t.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. For each s >0, define a new smooth structure by modifying",
