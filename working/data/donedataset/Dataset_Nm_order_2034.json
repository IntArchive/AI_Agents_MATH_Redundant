    "AcceptedAnswer": "This holds always. QiL posted a local solution, and explained that one direction is trivial. For the other direction I would argue as follows using basic facts about the decomposition groups. Let $E/K$ be a normal closure of $L/K$, and write $G=Gal(E/K)$, $G_i=Gal(E/L_i)\\le G$ and $H=Gal(E/L)$. Let $\\mathfrak{P}$ be any prime ideal of $E$ above $\\mathfrak{p}$, and let \n$$D=D(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p})\n=\\{\\sigma\\in G\\mid \\sigma(\\mathfrak{P})=\\mathfrak{P}\\}\\le G$$ \nbe the decomposition group. It is known that if $M$ is any intermediate field, and $\\mathfrak{p}_M=\\mathfrak{P}\\cap M$, then\n$e(\\mathfrak{p}_M\\mid\\mathfrak{p})=f(\\mathfrak{p}_M\\mid\\mathfrak{p})=1$ if and only if\n$M$ is contained in the decomposition field $Inv(D)$, or equivalently $D\\le Gal(E/M)$. By our assumption this is true, whenever $M$ is one of the fields $L_i$. Therefore $D\\le G_i$\nfor all $i$. Thus also $D\\le H=\\cap_i G_i$. Applying the above result in the opposite direction tells us then that for the prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}'=\\mathfrak{P}\\cap L$ we have $e(\\mathfrak{p}'\\mid\\mathfrak{p})=f(\\mathfrak{p}'\\mid\\mathfrak{p})=1$. All the prime\nideals $\\mathfrak{p}'$ of $L$ above $\\mathfrak{p}$ are gotten in this way, so the claim follows. With basic facts about decomposition groups in place this is more or less a tautology, so I don't know, if this answer is useful :-(",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking whether the splitting of a prime in the compositum of several fields depends on each of those fields being Galois extensions. The original statement holds when all the extensions L_i/K are Galois, but the question is if this remains true without the Galois condition.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the original theorem. When L_i/K are Galois, the compositum L has the property that a prime 𝔭 splits in L if and only if it splits in every L_i. The proof likely uses the fact that Galois extensions have unique splitting behavior, and since the compositum of Galois extensions is also Galois, we can use properties like transitivity of splitting.\n\nNow, if the L_i are not Galois, several issues might arise. For one, the compositum might not be Galois over K, so the usual Galois-theoretic arguments don't apply. Also, in non-Galois extensions, the splitting of primes can be more complicated because the decomposition groups aren't as nicely behaved.\n\nLet me think of a counterexample. Suppose we have two non-Galois extensions L_1 and L_2 of K such that a prime 𝔭 splits in both L_1 and L_2, but in their compositum L, maybe 𝔭 doesn't split. Alternatively, maybe 𝔭 doesn't split in each L_i but does in L. The key is to find such a case.\n\nConsider K = Q. Let L_1 and L_2 be two cubic fields where a prime p splits in both, but their compositum has a larger degree, say 9, and perhaps p ramifies or remains inert in the compositum. Wait, but splitting in the compositum usually requires splitting in all components, but maybe if the fields are not linearly disjoint, their compositum's behavior could differ.\n\nAlternatively, take K = Q, L_1 = Q(2^(1/3)), L_2 = Q(ω2^(1/3)), where ω is a primitive cube root of unity. Then L = Q(2^(1/3), ω) is the splitting field, which is Galois over Q. Let’s take prime 2. In L_1, the prime 2 is totally ramified, so it doesn't split. In L_2, which is also a non-Galois extension, but wait L_2 is actually not a real field. Wait, but maybe this example isn't right. Alternatively, take primes that split in each L_i but not in the compositum.\n\nAlternatively, let K = Q, L_1 and L_2 two distinct quadratic extensions that are not Galois. Wait, but quadratic extensions are always Galois if the base field has characteristic ≠2. So maybe degree 3 extensions. Let me think of K = Q. Let L_1 and L_2 be two different non-Galois cubic extensions. Suppose a prime p splits into two primes in L_1 (so with residue degree 1 and 2?), but wait, in a cubic non-Galois extension, the splitting of primes can be more complex. For example, a prime could split into one prime of degree 1 and another of degree 2. If another cubic extension L_2 has similar splitting, but their compositum might have a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, consider a prime p that splits completely in both L_1 and L_2. If the compositum has degree higher than 1, maybe p doesn't split completely there. Wait, but if p splits completely in each L_i, then in the compositum, it should split into at least [L:K] ideals, but maybe the compositum's degree over K is the product of degrees if they are linearly disjoint. But if they are not linearly disjoint, the degree is less. But splitting completely in each L_i usually implies splitting completely in the compositum. Wait, maybe this is only true when the extensions are Galois. For non-Galois extensions, even if p splits completely in each L_i, it might not in the compositum.\n\nWait, here's a possible example: Let K = Q. Let L_1 be a cubic field where prime 7 splits into three primes of degree 1 (so splits completely). Let L_2 be another cubic field where 7 also splits completely. Suppose that L_1 and L_2 are linearly disjoint over Q, so their compositum L has degree 9. If 7 splits completely in both, then in L, it should split into 9 primes? But maybe if the compositum isn't Galois, the splitting could be different. Wait, but even non-Galois extensions can have primes splitting completely. Wait, but in the compositum, if each L_i is a degree 3 non-Galois extension, and L_1 and L_2 are linearly disjoint, then L = L_1L_2 has degree 9. If 7 splits completely in both L_1 and L_2, then in L, it should split into 3*3=9 primes. But maybe the compositum is not Galois, but the splitting still occurs. However, maybe there's a prime that splits in each L_i but not in the compositum. Alternatively, maybe the converse: a prime splits in the compositum but not in some L_i.\n\nAlternatively, take K = Q, let L_1 be Q(2^(1/3)) and L_2 be Q(3^(1/3)). Both are non-Galois cubic extensions. Let’s look at prime p=5. In L_1, since x^3 - 2 factors modulo 5 as (x - 3)(x^2 + 3x + 4), so it splits into a linear and quadratic factor. Similarly, in L_2, x^3 - 3 modulo 5 factors as (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4). So in both L_1 and L_2, p=5 splits into one prime of degree 1 and one of degree 2. Now, the compositum L = Q(2^(1/3), 3^(1/3)). The degree [L:Q] is 9, since L_1 and L_2 are linearly disjoint. Then, how does 5 split in L? If each L_i has a factor of degree 1 and 2, then in the compositum, the splitting would involve combinations. But maybe in L, the prime 5 splits into primes with residue degrees that multiply to 9. For example, each extension contributes a degree 1 and 2, so in the compositum, the possible residue degrees could be 1, 2, or combinations. But if the compositum is not Galois, the splitting might not be as straightforward. However, I'm not sure if this example actually leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is still true even without Galois extensions. The user is asking whether the equivalence holds. If it does, then how to prove it. If not, provide a counterexample.\n\nWait, in the original case with Galois extensions, the proof probably uses that if a prime splits in all L_i, then in their compositum (which is Galois), the decomposition group is trivial, hence the prime splits completely. Conversely, if it splits in the compositum, then it must split in each L_i. But without Galois, this might fail.\n\nAnother approach: Consider the ring of integers. If a prime 𝔭 splits in L, then its splitting implies certain factorization in each L_i. But maybe in non-Galois extensions, the splitting in the compositum could imply splitting in each component, but the converse might not hold. Alternatively, maybe splitting in each L_i implies splitting in compositum, but the converse isn't true. Wait, the original question is the equivalence: 𝔭 splits in L iff it splits in all L_i. So does this hold when L_i are not Galois?\n\nSuppose that L_i are not Galois. If 𝔭 splits in L, then its inertia and decomposition groups in L/K are trivial. But since each L_i is a subfield of L, the decomposition group for L_i/K would be a quotient of that for L/K. So if decomposition group for L/K is trivial, then for each L_i, the decomposition group must also be trivial, implying 𝔭 splits in each L_i. So maybe the forward direction holds even without Galois. Conversely, if 𝔭 splits in each L_i, then in each L_i, decomposition group is trivial. Since L is compositum, the decomposition group of L/K would inject into the product of decomposition groups of L_i/K, but since each is trivial, decomposition group of L/K is trivial, hence 𝔭 splits in L. But this argument might require that the extensions are Galois.\n\nWait, decomposition groups are defined for Galois extensions. If L/K is not Galois, then we need to pass to the Galois closure. So maybe the original proof relies on the Galois condition to talk about decomposition groups. So if the L_i are not Galois, then the compositum L may not be Galois, and decomposition groups aren't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, consider the splitting in terms of factorization. If a prime 𝔭 splits completely in each L_i, then in the compositum, it should split into as many primes as the product of the degrees, but only if the extensions are linearly disjoint. But if they are not, the splitting could be different. However, in general, if 𝔭 splits in each L_i, then in their compositum, it should split into at least some number of primes, but maybe not completely. However, the original statement is about splitting (not necessarily completely). Wait, the user says \"splits in L\", which in number theory usually means splits completely, but maybe in the context, \"splits\" means factors into primes with residue degree 1. Wait, need to clarify.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user says \"a prime 𝔭 of K splits in L if and only if it splits in all of L_i\". The term \"splits\" here might mean \"splits completely\", i.e., factors into primes of residue degree 1. Because in Galois extensions, a prime splitting completely in each L_i implies it splits completely in the compositum. Conversely, if it splits completely in the compositum, it must split completely in each L_i.\n\nBut if the extensions are not Galois, does this equivalence hold? Suppose L_i are not Galois. If a prime splits completely in each L_i, does it split completely in the compositum? Not necessarily. For example, take K=Q, L_1=Q(2^(1/3)), L_2=Q(ω2^(1/3)), where ω is a cube root of unity. Then L=Q(2^(1/3), ω) is the Galois closure. Now, take prime 5. Suppose in L_1, 5 splits into (1,2) as before, and similarly in L_2. But in L, which is Galois over Q, 5 might split into more primes. However, if a prime splits completely in L_1 and L_2, then in L, which is their compositum, it might split completely. But wait, if L_1 and L_2 are not Galois, and the compositum is Galois, then maybe splitting in compositum requires more. But this example might not directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, take K=Q, and let L_1 be a non-Galois cubic field where prime p=7 splits completely. Let L_2 be another non-Galois cubic field where p=7 also splits completely. Suppose L_1 and L_2 are linearly disjoint, so compositum L has degree 9. If p splits completely in both, then in L, p would split into 9 primes, each of degree 1. So in this case, it does split completely. But what if the compositum isn't Galois? Suppose L_1 and L_2 are the same field. Then the compositum is L_1, and p splits completely. So in this case, the statement holds.\n\nBut maybe there's a case where a prime splits in each L_i but not in the compositum. Let's see. Suppose K=Q, L_1=Q(a) where a is a root of x^4 - 2, which is not Galois. L_2=Q(b) where b is a root of x^4 - 3, also not Galois. Then compositum L=Q(a,b). Take prime p=5. Suppose in L_1, 5 splits into two primes of degree 2, and in L_2 similarly. Then in L, the compositum, what happens? The degree [L:Q] is 16 if they are linearly disjoint. If in each L_i, p splits into two degree 2 primes, then in L, p might split into 2*2=4 primes, each of degree 4? But then p doesn't split completely in L. However, in this case, the prime didn't split completely in the L_i, so the example doesn't address the original question.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we have a prime p that splits completely in each L_i (non-Galois), but in the compositum, it doesn't split completely. Is that possible? For example, take K=Q, L_1=Q(2^(1/3)), which has degree 3. Let p=7, and suppose p splits into three primes in L_1 (splits completely). Wait, but earlier example with x^3 - 2 modulo 7 factors as linear factors? Let me check: x^3 - 2 modulo 7. The cubes modulo 7 are 0,1, and 6. 2 is not a cube, since 1^3=1, 2^3=8≡1, 3^3=27≡6, 4^3=64≡1, 5^3=125≡6, 6^3=216≡6. So x^3 - 2 is irreducible modulo 7, so p=7 remains prime in L_1. So that's not a good example.\n\nWait, maybe take p=31. In Q(2^(1/3)), the splitting of 31: check if x^3 - 2 has roots modulo 31. Let's see: 2 modulo 31 is 2. Compute cubes: 0^3=0, 1=1, 2=8, 3=27, 4=64≡2, so 4^3 ≡ 2 mod 31. Thus x^3 -2 factors as (x -4)(x^2 +4x + 16) modulo 31. So in L_1=Q(2^(1/3)), p=31 splits into a product of a prime of degree 1 and a prime of degree 2. So it doesn't split completely. So maybe take a different prime that splits completely.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider a prime that splits completely in a non-Galois extension. Suppose we have a cubic extension where a prime splits completely. For example, the splitting field of x^3 - x -1, which has discriminant -23, so the primes that split completely are those where the polynomial factors into linear factors. For p=23, maybe it ramifies. Let me check. This might be too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, think abstractly: Suppose you have two non-Galois extensions L_1 and L_2 of K, and a prime 𝔭 that splits completely in both. If the compositum L is not Galois over K, but 𝔭 splits completely in each L_i, does it necessarily split completely in L? If the degrees are coprime and the extensions are linearly disjoint, then the residue degree in L would be the least common multiple of the residue degrees in each L_i. Wait, but if they split completely, residue degree is 1 in each, so in the compositum, residue degree is 1. Hence, 𝔭 would split completely in L. Conversely, if 𝔭 splits completely in L, then in each L_i, it must split completely, since residue degree in L_i divides that in L. So if residue degree in L is 1, then in each L_i, it must also be 1. Therefore, the equivalence might hold even without Galois extensions.\n\nWait, but this seems to contradict the initial thought that Galois is necessary. But the key point is about residue degrees. If a prime splits completely in L, then in each subfield, the residue degree must divide 1, so it's 1. Conversely, if in each L_i the residue degree is 1, then in the compositum, the residue degree is lcm(1,1,...,1)=1, hence splits completely. Similarly for inertial degrees. Therefore, the equivalence might hold regardless of the extensions being Galois or not.\n\nBut wait, residue degree and ramification index multiply in towers. So if L/K has a prime 𝔓 over 𝔭, then the residue degree f(𝔓|𝔭) is equal to the lcm of the residue degrees in each step if we go through intermediate fields. But if we have multiple fields, the compositum's residue degree over K would be the lcm of the residue degrees from each L_i. Therefore, if in each L_i, the residue degree is 1, then the lcm is 1, hence residue degree in L is 1. Similarly, the ramification index in L is the lcm of the ramification indices in each L_i. But splitting completely usually means that the residue degree and ramification index are both 1. So if in each L_i, 𝔭 is unramified and has residue degree 1 (i.e., splits completely), then in the compositum, it's unramified and residue degree 1, hence splits completely. Conversely, if 𝔭 splits completely in L, then in each L_i, the residue degree must divide 1, so is 1, and similarly for ramification. Hence, the equivalence holds even without assuming the extensions are Galois.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"splits in L\" – if \"splits\" just means factors into primes, not necessarily completely, then the situation is different. For example, a prime can split into multiple primes in each L_i and in the compositum. However, in the context of number fields, \"splits\" often means splits completely, but the user's original statement with Galois extensions uses the property that splitting (completely) in the compositum is equivalent to splitting in each component. So likely, the answer is that the equivalence holds even without Galois, because splitting completely in each L_i implies splitting completely in the compositum, and vice versa, based on residue degrees and ramification indices.\n\nTherefore, the user's assumption that the original proof uses Galois might be unnecessary, and the result holds in general. Hence, the answer is that the statement remains true even when the extensions are not Galois, and the proof follows by considering the residue degrees and ramification indices in the compositum.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if this is actually true. Let me recall some references. In Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory, when discussing the decomposition of primes in composita, he does mention that if a prime splits completely in each L_i, then it splits completely in the compositum, and vice versa, regardless of the extensions being Galois. The reason is that the residue degree and ramification index in the compositum are the least common multiples of those in the individual extensions. Hence, if in each L_i, the residue degree and ramification index are 1, then so they are in the compositum. Conversely, if in the compositum they are 1, then in each L_i, they must have been 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the statement does hold even when the L_i are not Galois extensions, and the proof follows by considering the properties of residue degrees and ramification indices in composita.",
