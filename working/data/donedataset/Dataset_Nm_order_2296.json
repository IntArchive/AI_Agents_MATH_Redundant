    "Content": "I am studying topological groups, and I have been able to do quite a lot on my own by proving the propositions in this link on my own, but when I read up wikipedia that topological groups are all completely regular, I wasn't able to either find a proof or do it myself, which got me concerned. The question is ; can anyone confirm me that topological groups are indeed completely regular, and if so, where could I find a proof, or do you know it? One proof I would be interested in is that accordingly to this Wikipedia page concerning uniform spaces , a topological group can be equipped with the structure of a uniform space in a canonical way, and uniform spaces are completely regular. I don't know how to prove this one either. I would also be interested in a more direct approach if possible for the purposes of giving a talk on topological spaces ; if a direct proof is shorter than the one going through uniform spaces, it would give me more time in my talk to mention other things.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Every uniform space $(X,\\mathcal D)$ is completely regular. sketch of a proof: Suppose $F$ is closed in $(X,\\mathcal D)$ and $p\\in F^c$. There's a pseudometric uniformity $P$ on $X$, such that:\n$$\\mathcal D=\\mathcal D_P=\\bigcup_{d\\in P}\\mathcal D_d$$\nWhere $\\mathcal D_d$ is the usual uniformity by the pseudometric $d:X^2\\to [0,\\infty)$. For each $d\\in P$, define\n$$f_d:X\\to\\Bbb R$$\n$$f_d(x)=\\inf_{c\\in F}d(c,x)$$\nand\n$$g_d:X\\to \\Bbb R$$\n$$g_d(x)=d(p,x)$$\n$f_d$ and $g_d$ are continuous. It's not hard to prove there's some $d_0\\in P$ with\n$$(\\forall a\\in X)(f_{d_0}(a)\\ne 0\\text{   or   } g_{d_0}(a)\\ne 0)$$ This may help. Define\n$$h:X\\to [0,1]$$\n$$h(x)=\\frac{g_{d_0}(x)}{g_{d_0}(x)+f_{d_0}(x)}$$\n$h$ is continuous and\n$$h(p)=0,\\quad h(F)=\\{1\\}$$ Edit: linked",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that topological groups are completely regular. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement itself.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the question. The key elements here are topological groups. So the main assumption is that we have a topological group. The problem is to prove that all such topological groups are completely regular.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the original question references uniform spaces as a possible path for the proof. But in the example given, the assumptions were about the properties of the object in the problem. In this case, the topological group is the primary object. The fact that it can be given a uniform structure is part of the potential proof, but maybe not an assumption. Wait, the user wants assumptions of the problem, not the steps to solve it. So the assumptions here are that we have a topological group. The problem is to prove it's completely regular.\n\nBut the original question also mentions that the user is interested in two approaches: one via uniform spaces and another direct one. However, in the problem formatting example, the assumptions are only about the conditions given in the problem. So here, the problem is \"Prove that topological groups are completely regular.\" The assumption is that the space is a topological group. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological group.\n\nProblem:\nProve that G is completely regular.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the only assumption is that G is a topological group. So the formatted problem should list that as the assumption, and the problem is to prove complete regularity.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not including extra information from the user's thoughts, like the part about uniform spaces. That's part of the user's consideration for the proof, but the problem itself is just about topological groups being completely regular. So yes, the assumption is that G is a topological group, and the problem is to prove it's completely regular. That should be it.",
