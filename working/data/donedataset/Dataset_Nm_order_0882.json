    "Content": "There is a famous proof of the sum of integers, supposedly put forward by Gauss. $$S_n=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}i=1+2+3+\\cdots+(n-2)+(n-1)+n$$ $$S_{2n}=(1+n)+(2+(n-1))+\\cdots+(n+1)$$ $$S=\\frac{n(1+n)}{2}$$ I was looking for a similar proof for when $S=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}i^2$ I've tried the same approach of adding the summation to itself in reverse, and I've found this: $$S_{2n}=(1^2+n^2)+(2^2+n^2+1^2-2n)+(3^2+n^2+2^2-4n)+\\cdots+(n^2+n^2+(n-1)^2-2(n-1)n$$ From which I noted I could extract the original sum; $$S_{2n}-S_n=(1^2+n^2)+(2^2+n^2-2n)+(3^2+n^2-4n)+\\cdots+(n^2+n^2-2(n-1)n-n^2$$ Then if I collect all the $n$ terms; $$S_{2n}-S_n=n\\cdot (n-1)^2 +(1^2)+(2^2-2n)+(3^2-4n)+\\cdots+(n^2-2(n-1)n$$ But then I realised I still had the original sum in there, and taking that out mean I no longer had a sum term to extract. Have I made a mistake here? How can I arrive at the answer of $\\dfrac{n (n + 1) (2 n + 1)}{6}$ using a method similar to the one I expound on above? I.e following Gauss' line of reasoning ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can use something similar, though it requires work at the end. If $S_n = 1^2 +2^2 + \\cdots + n^2$ then \n$$S_{2n}-2S_n = ((2n)^2 - 1^2) + ((2n-1)^2-2^2) +\\cdots +((n+1)^2-n^2)$$ $$=(2n+1)(2n-1 + 2n-3 + \\cdots +1) = (2n+1)n^2$$ using the Gaussian trick in the middle. Similarly $$S_{2n+1}-2S_n = (2n+1)(n+1)^2$$ So for example to work out $S_9$, you start $$S_0=0^2=0$$ $$S_1=1 + 2S_0 = 1$$ $$S_2=3+2S_1=5$$ $$S_4=25+2S_2=30$$ $$S_9 = 225+2S_4 = 285$$ but clearly there are easier ways.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants a structured problem based on the Math Stack Exchange question about finding a Gaussian-like proof for the sum of squares. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original question is asking for a method similar to Gauss's approach for the sum of integers but applied to the sum of squares. The user tried adding the summation in reverse but got stuck. The goal is to prove the formula for S = sum_{i=1}^n i^2 using a method like Gauss's.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are specific conditions. In this case, the problem isn't about divisibility but about the method of proof. The key assumptions here would relate to the approach being similar to Gauss's, which involves pairing terms or manipulating the sum in a clever way. However, the original problem doesn't state any explicit conditions on n, except that it's a positive integer. The user's attempt involved creating S_{2n} by adding the sum to itself in reverse, but that might not be the right path. \n\nSo, the assumptions here would be that the user is trying to use a method that mirrors Gauss's technique for the sum of integers. The problem is to prove the formula for the sum of squares using such a method. The assumptions might include that the user is working with the sum of squares from 1 to n, and using a similar approach of reversing and adding the sequence. However, the original problem doesn't mention any specific restrictions on n, so the assumptions should be minimal. Maybe just that n is a positive integer and that the approach follows Gauss's line of reasoning.\n\nWait, in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But here, in this sum of squares problem, there's no such divisibility condition. So perhaps the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. But since the example included even unnecessary assumptions (like in the original problem, the user had to filter out the part where n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem), but in the example provided, the user restructured the problem by adding that assumption. Wait, no, looking back, in the original problem example, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n...\" but in the formatted version, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That must be a mistake. So maybe the user made an error in their example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which contradicts the original problem's statement. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the actual task is to list the correct assumptions from the problem. But the user might have intended to filter out unrelated info. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted version, the assumption is n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the correct assumptions should be that n is an integer, and there's no divisibility by 7 unless the problem requires it. But in that example, maybe the problem was actually to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\". Hmm, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. So maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about proving the sum of squares formula using a method similar to Gauss's. The original problem doesn't have any specific conditions on n except that it's a positive integer. So the assumptions should be that n is a positive integer. However, the example from the user added an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example was a bad example. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So the example's formatted problem added an incorrect assumption. Therefore, perhaps the user's instruction is to filter out unrelated information, but in the example, they added an assumption that wasn't there. So maybe the user made a mistake, but I should follow the actual problem.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated info. The original question on Math Exchange is about finding a Gaussian-like proof for the sum of squares. The user attempted to reverse the sum and add it, but got stuck. The problem is to prove that the sum of squares from 1 to n is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 using a method similar to Gauss's.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBecause the sum is from 1 to n, so n must be a positive integer. There's no mention of any other conditions. The problem is to prove the formula using a method similar to Gauss's approach for the sum of integers.\n\nHence, formatted as:\n\nAssumption: \nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}i^2 = \\dfrac{n (n + 1) (2 n + 1)}{6}$$ using a method similar to Gauss's approach for the sum of integers.\n\nI think that's it. The key here is that the problem wants the proof method to be similar to Gauss's, which is the main point. The example given by the user had an incorrect assumption added, but in this case, the only assumption needed is that n is a positive integer.",
