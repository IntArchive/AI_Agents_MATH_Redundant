    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let us use the following : For a point $P$ inside $\\triangle{ABC}$, \n  $$\\vec{OP}=\\frac{[\\triangle{PBC}]\\cdot\\vec{OA}+[\\triangle{PCA}]\\cdot\\vec{OB}+[\\triangle{PAB}]\\cdot\\vec{OC}}{[\\triangle{ABC}]}\\tag 1$$\n  where $[\\triangle{PBC}]$ is the area of $\\triangle{PBC}$. Proof : $\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad$ Since\n  $$\\vec{OA'}=\\frac{A'C\\cdot \\vec{OB}+BA'\\cdot\\vec{OC}}{A'C+BA'}=\\frac{[\\triangle{PCA}]\\cdot\\vec{OB}+[\\triangle{PAB}]\\cdot\\vec{OC}}{[\\triangle{PCA}]+[\\triangle{PAB}]},$$\n  we have\n  $$\\begin{align}\\vec{OP}&=\\frac{PA'\\cdot\\vec{OA}+AP\\cdot\\vec{OA'}}{PA'+AP}\\\\&=\\frac{[\\triangle{PBC}]\\cdot\\vec{OA}+([\\triangle{PAB}]+[\\triangle{PCA}])\\cdot\\vec{OA'}}{[\\triangle{PBC}]+([\\triangle{PAB}]+[\\triangle{PCA}])}\\\\&=\\frac{[\\triangle{PBC}]\\cdot\\vec{OA}+[\\triangle{PCA}]\\cdot\\vec{OB}+[\\triangle{PAB}]\\cdot\\vec{OC}}{[\\triangle{PBC}]+[\\triangle{PCA}]+[\\triangle{PAB}]}\\\\&=\\frac{[\\triangle{PBC}]\\cdot\\vec{OA}+[\\triangle{PCA}]\\cdot\\vec{OB}+[\\triangle{PAB}]\\cdot\\vec{OC}}{[\\triangle{ABC}]}\\end{align}$$\n  (By the way, $(1)$ holds for any point $P$ if we define the area of a \"flipped\" triangle as negative.) For 1. Let $I$ be the incenter. Since $[\\triangle{IBC}]:[\\triangle{ICA}]:[\\triangle{IAB}]=a:b:c$, by the law of sines, we have $$\\begin{align}\\vec{PI}&=\\frac{a\\vec{PA}+b\\vec{PB}+c\\vec{PC}}{a+b+c}\\\\&=\\frac{R\\sin A\\vec{PA}+R\\sin B\\vec{PB}+R\\sin C\\vec{PC}}{R\\sin A+R\\sin B+R\\sin C}\\\\&=\\frac{\\sin A\\vec{PA}+\\sin B\\vec{PB}+\\sin C\\vec{PC}}{\\sin A+\\sin B+\\sin C}\\end{align}$$where $R$ is the circumradius of $\\triangle{ABC}$. So, setting $k=\\sin A+\\sin B+\\sin C$ gives\n$$\\vec{PI}=\\frac{\\sin A\\vec{PA}+\\sin B(\\vec{AB}-\\vec{AP})+\\sin C(\\vec{AC}-\\vec{AP})}{k}=\\frac{k\\vec{PA}+\\sin B\\vec{AB}+\\sin C\\vec{AC}}{k}$$\n$$\\Rightarrow \\vec{PA}=\\vec{PI}-\\frac{\\sin B}{k}\\vec{AB}-\\frac{\\sin C}{k}\\vec{AC}.$$ Similarly, we have\n$$\\vec{PB}=\\vec{PI}-\\frac{\\sin A}{k}\\vec{BA}-\\frac{\\sin C}{k}\\vec{BC},\\quad\\vec{PC}=\\vec{PI}-\\frac{\\sin B}{k}\\vec{CB}-\\frac{\\sin A}{k}\\vec{CA}.$$ So, $$\\small\\begin{align}&PA^2\\sin A+PB^2\\sin B+PC^2\\sin C\\\\&=\\left(\\vec{PI}-\\frac{\\sin B}{k}\\vec{AB}-\\frac{\\sin C}{k}\\vec{AC}\\right)^2\\sin A+\\left(\\vec{PI}-\\frac{\\sin A}{k}\\vec{BA}-\\frac{\\sin C}{k}\\vec{BC}\\right)^2\\sin B+\\left(\\vec{PI}-\\frac{\\sin B}{k}\\vec{CB}-\\frac{\\sin A}{k}\\vec{CA}\\right)^2\\sin C\\\\&=kPI^2+\\left(-2\\sin A\\sin B(\\vec{AB}+\\vec{BA})-2\\sin B\\sin C(\\vec{BC}+\\vec{CB})-2\\sin C\\sin A(\\vec{AC}+\\vec{CA})\\right)\\cdot\\frac{\\vec{PI}}{k}+s\\\\&=(\\sin A+\\sin B+\\sin C)PI^2+s\\end{align}$$\nwhere $s$ is a constant independent from $P$. So, $PA^2\\sin A+PB^2\\sin B+PC^2\\sin C$ is minimum if $P=I$. For 2. Let $H$ be the orthocenter. Since $[\\triangle{HCA}]:[\\triangle{HAB}]=A'C:BA'=\\frac{AA'}{\\tan C}:\\frac{AA'}{\\tan B}=\\tan B:\\tan C$ where $A'$ is on the side $BC$ such that $AA'$ is perpendicular to $BC$, we have\n$$[\\triangle{HBC}]:[\\triangle{HCA}]:[\\triangle{HAB}]=\\tan A:\\tan B:\\tan C.$$ So, $$\\vec{PH}=\\frac{\\tan A\\vec{PA}+\\tan B\\vec{PB}+\\tan C\\vec{PC}}{\\tan A+\\tan B+\\tan C}.$$ By the similar argument as the one in the first, we can have\n$$PA^2\\tan A+PB^2\\tan B+PC^2\\tan C=(\\tan A+\\tan B+\\tan C)PH^2+t$$\nwhere $t$ is a constant independent from $P$. Thus, $PA^2\\tan A+PB^2\\tan B+PC^2\\tan C$ is minimum if $P=H$. For 3. Let $G$ be the centroid. We have $$\\vec{PG}=\\frac{\\vec{PA}+\\vec{PB}+\\vec{PC}}{3}.$$ So, $$\\vec{PA}=\\vec{PG}-\\frac{\\vec{AB}+\\vec{AC}}{3},\\quad\\vec{PB}=\\vec{PG}-\\frac{\\vec{BA}+\\vec{BC}}{3},\\quad\\vec{PC}=\\vec{PG}-\\frac{\\vec{CB}+\\vec{CA}}{3}.$$ Hence, we have\n$$\\begin{align}&PA^2+PB^2+PC^2\\\\&=\\left(\\vec{PG}-\\frac{\\vec{AB}+\\vec{AC}}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(\\vec{PG}-\\frac{\\vec{BA}+\\vec{BC}}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(\\vec{PG}-\\frac{\\vec{CB}+\\vec{CA}}{3}\\right)^2\\\\&=3PG^2+u\\end{align}$$\nwhere $u$ is a constant independent from $P$. Thus, $PA^2+PB^2+PC^2$ is minimum if $P=G$. For 4. Let $O$ be the circumcenter. Since $$\\begin{align}[\\triangle{OBC}]:[\\triangle{OCA}]:[\\triangle{OAB}]&=\\frac{R^2\\sin(2A)}{2}:\\frac{R^2\\sin(2B)}{2}:\\frac{R^2\\sin(2C)}{2}\\\\&=\\sin(2A):\\sin(2B):\\sin(2C),\\end{align}$$\nwe have $$\\vec{PO}=\\frac{\\sin(2A)\\vec{PA}+\\sin(2B)\\vec{PB}+\\sin(2C)\\vec{PC}}{\\sin(2A)+\\sin(2B)+\\sin(2C)}.$$ By the similar argument as the one in the first, we have\n$$PA^2\\sin(2A)+PB^2\\sin(2B)+PC^2\\sin(2C)=(\\sin(2A)+\\sin(2B)+\\sin(2C))PO^2+v$$\nwhere $v$ is a constant independent from $P$. Thus, $PA^2\\sin(2A)+PB^2\\sin(2B)+PC^2\\sin(2C)$ is minimum if $P=O$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that certain expressions involving a point P in triangle ABC are minimized when P is a specific center (incenter, orthocenter, centroid, circumcenter). The user is asking how to approach this, possibly through differentiation or another method.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions triangle ABC with sides a, b, c opposite angles A, B, C. The point P is in the plane of ABC. Each of the four expressions (PA² sin A + ... etc.) is supposed to be minimized when P is a particular center. The question also asks about formulating the expression for differentiation or another approach.\n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So, the triangle ABC exists with sides a, b, c opposite angles A, B, C. P is a point in the plane. Then, each expression is associated with a specific center. But since the problem is to prove that each minimum occurs at a specific center, perhaps the assumptions are just the basic setup: triangle ABC exists, P is any point in the plane, and the expressions are defined as given. However, the original problem mentions \"if P is the incenter\", etc., which are the conclusions, not the assumptions. So the assumptions are the properties of the triangle and the point being any point in the plane.\n\nWait, looking back at the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, only the first part was kept as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- ABC is a triangle.\n\n- a, b, c are the lengths of sides BC, CA, AB respectively.\n\n- Angles A, B, C are opposite to sides a, b, c respectively.\n\n- P is a point in the plane of triangle ABC.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove that each of the four expressions is minimized when P is the respective center.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list these assumptions line by line and then state the problem as proving each of the four statements. However, the user's example only included one problem statement per format, but here there are four separate ones. But the original question seems to present all four as parts of the same problem. The user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format. So perhaps each of the four parts should be considered separate problems? But the original question is presented as a single problem with four parts. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the given problem here, the original problem states \"prove that PA² sin A + ... is minimum if P is the incenter\" and similar for the other centers. So the assumptions would include that ABC is a triangle, a,b,c are sides opposite angles A,B,C, and P is any point in the plane. The problem is to prove each of the four minimization statements. However, the example only had one problem per format. Since the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" into the format, maybe each part should be treated as a separate problem. But the user hasn't specified that. The original question includes four different minimization problems in one, so perhaps the formatted problem should list all four as the problem statement, each as a separate part. Alternatively, maybe the user wants each part as a separate problem. But given the example, which only had one problem, I think the correct approach is to list all four in the problem statement, as the original question is presented that way. So the formatted problem's \"Problem\" section would include all four parts. However, the example's problem was a single statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So the structure is to take the original problem, filter out unrelated info, list assumptions line by line, and then state the problem.\n\nIn this case, the original question includes four different expressions and their respective centers. So the assumptions are the basic setup of the triangle, sides, angles, and P being any point. The problem is to prove that each expression is minimized when P is the specified center. The user also asks about formulating for differentiation or another approach, but that's part of the question, not the problem statement. So when structuring, we need to present the problem as \"Prove that PA² sin A + ... is minimum if P is the incenter\", etc., all four statements.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- ABC is a triangle.\n\n- a, b, c are the lengths of sides BC, CA, AB respectively.\n\n- Angles A, B, C are opposite to sides a, b, c respectively.\n\n- P is a point in the plane of triangle ABC.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove all four statements. However, each assumption should be one line addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nABC is a triangle,\na, b, c are the lengths of sides BC, CA, AB respectively,\nangles A, B, C are opposite to sides a, b, c respectively,\nP is a point in the plane of triangle ABC.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. PA² sin A + PB² sin B + PC² sin C is minimum if P is the incenter,\n2. PA² tan A + PB² tan B + PC² tan C is minimum if P is the orthocenter,\n3. PA² + PB² + PC² is minimum if P is the centroid,\n4. PA² sin 2A + PB² sin 2B + PC² sin 2C is minimum if P is the circumcenter.\n\nBut the original problem statement mentions all four as separate parts. So the formatted problem should include all four in the problem section. The user's example included a single problem, but here it's four in one. Since the format requires \"the problem\", it's acceptable to list all four as parts of the problem statement. The question about differentiation is part of the user's query but not part of the problem statement. So the final formatted problem should have the four parts listed under the problem section.",
