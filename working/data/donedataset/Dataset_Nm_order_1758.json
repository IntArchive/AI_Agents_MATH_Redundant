    "Content": "I recently read the well known theorem that for a group $G$ and $H$ a normal subgroup of $G$, then $G$ is solvable if and only if $H$ and $G/H$ are solvable. In my book, only the fact that $G$ is solvable implies $H$ is solvable was proven. I was able to show that if $H$ and $G/H$ are solvable, then so is $G$, but I can't quite show that $G$ is solvable implies $G/H$ is solvable. My idea was this. Since $G$ is solvable, there exists a normal abelian tower\n$$\nG=G_0\\supset G_1\\supset\\cdots\\supset G_r=\\{e\\}.\n$$\nI let $K_i=G_i/(H\\cap G_i)$, in hopes of getting a sequence\n$$\nG/H\\supset K_1\\supset\\cdots\\supset K_r=\\{e\\}.\n$$\nMy hunch is that the above is also a normal abelian tower. However, I'm having trouble verifying that $K_{i+1}\\unlhd K_i$ and that $K_i/K_{i+1}$ is abelian. Writing $H_i=H\\cap G_i$, I take $gH_{i+1}\\in K_{i+1}$ for some $g\\in G_{i+1}$. If $g'H_i\\in K_i$, then I want to show $g'H_igH_{i+1}g'^{-1}H_i$ is still in $K_{i+1}$, but manipulating the cosets threw me off. I also tried to use either the second or third isomorphism theorems to show that $K_i/K_{i+1}$ is abelian, but I'm not clear on how to apply it exactly. I'd be grateful to see how this result comes through. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You're approach looks good to me.\nIt might help to rewrite $K_i = G_i/(H\\cap G_i)$ in the form $K_i = (G_i H)/H,$\nso that you have a sequence of groups $G_i H$ all containing $H$, whose quotients are giving the $K_i$.  Now to verify that $K_{i+1}$ is normal in $K_i$, you just\nhave to verify that $G_{i+1} H$ is normal in $G_i H$, which isn't too hard to do.\n(Essentially, the computations with cosets that were giving you trouble have all\nbeen wrapped up once and for all into the isomorphism $G_i/(H\\cap G_i) \\cong\n(G_i H)/H$, and the coset computations with $G_{i+1} H$ inside $G_i H$ will\nbe quite a bit easier.) To see that $K_i/K_{i+1}$ is abelian, you can again use isomorphism theorems,\nto rewrite it as $(G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H)\n\\cong G_i/(G_{i+1} H \\cap G_i).$   You should be able to see that the latter group\nis a quotient of $G_i/G_{i+1}$, and so, being a quotient of an abelian group,\nis abelian. As a general remark, when studying the image of a subgroup $G'$ under a quotient map $G \\to G/H$,\npassing back and forth between the descriptions $G'/G'\\cap H$ and $G'H/H$\nis a very standard method.  The former description helps you think about\nthe the image as a quotient of the given subgroup $G'$, while the latter\ndescription is useful for bringing into play the fact that \"the lattice of subgroups of\n$G/H$ corresponds to the lattice of subgroups of $G$ containing $H$\" --- it rewrites the\nimage as the quotient of a subgroup containing $H$, and so helps you understand the inclusion relations and so on between different images as $G'$ varies.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about proving that if a group G is solvable, then the quotient group G/H is also solvable, where H is a normal subgroup of G. They mentioned they were able to show the converse (if H and G/H are solvable, then G is solvable) but are stuck on this direction.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a solvable group is. A group is solvable if it has a normal series where each factor group is abelian. So, the definition involves having a chain of subgroups from G down to the trivial group, each normal in the previous one, with abelian quotients.\n\nThe user tried taking the existing normal abelian tower for G and constructing a tower for G/H by taking quotients involving H. Specifically, they set K_i = G_i / (H ∩ G_i). Their approach was to form a series G/H ⊃ K_1 ⊃ ... ⊃ K_r = {e} and check if this is a normal abelian tower.\n\nLet me try to see where the difficulty is. The user is having trouble verifying that each K_{i+1} is normal in K_i and that the quotient K_i/K_{i+1} is abelian. \n\nLet me break this down. Given the original series for G: G = G_0 ⊃ G_1 ⊃ ... ⊃ G_r = {e}, each G_{i+1} is normal in G_i, and G_i/G_{i+1} is abelian.\n\nNow, when we take K_i = G_i / (H ∩ G_i), perhaps it's better to think of this as (G_i H)/H, since by the second isomorphism theorem, G_i/(G_i ∩ H) ≅ (G_i H)/H. But since H is normal in G, G_i H is a subgroup of G. However, the user is trying to map this into G/H. Wait, maybe we should consider the image of the original series under the natural homomorphism π: G → G/H, which sends g to gH. The image of G_i under π would be π(G_i) = G_i H / H. \n\nSo, if we take the image of the original normal series under π, we get a series in G/H: π(G_0) = G/H ⊃ π(G_1) ⊃ ... ⊃ π(G_r) = π({e}) = H/H = {e}. Now, since each G_{i+1} is normal in G_i, then π(G_{i+1}) is normal in π(G_i}) because homomorphisms preserve normality when the homomorphism is surjective. Wait, π is surjective from G to G/H, so the image of a normal subgroup under π should be normal in the image. Hmm, but here we're looking at π restricted to G_i. Let me confirm: If N is normal in G_i, then π(N) is normal in π(G_i). Because for any element π(g_i) in π(G_i) and π(n) in π(N), we have π(g_i) π(n) π(g_i)^{-1} = π(g_i n g_i^{-1}). Since N is normal in G_i, g_i n g_i^{-1} ∈ N, so this is in π(N). Therefore, π(N) is normal in π(G_i). \n\nTherefore, the series π(G_i) in G/H would have each subsequent group normal in the previous. So, the series G/H = π(G_0) ⊃ π(G_1) ⊃ ... ⊃ {e} is a normal series. Now, we need to check if the quotients π(G_i)/π(G_{i+1}) are abelian.\n\nBut π(G_i)/π(G_{i+1}) is isomorphic to (G_i H / H) / (G_{i+1} H / H). By the third isomorphism theorem, this quotient is isomorphic to (G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H). Now, we need to see if this is abelian. \n\nAlternatively, consider the original quotient G_i/G_{i+1} which is abelian. There's a homomorphism from G_i/G_{i+1} to (G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H) given by mapping gG_{i+1} to g (G_{i+1} H). The kernel of this homomorphism would be the elements gG_{i+1} such that g ∈ G_{i+1} H. But since H is normal in G, G_{i+1} H is a subgroup. So, the kernel is (G_{i+1} H ∩ G_i)/G_{i+1}. But maybe this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, since G_i/G_{i+1} is abelian, any homomorphic image of it must also be abelian. The quotient (G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H) is a homomorphic image of G_i/G_{i+1}, because we can compose the natural projection G_i → G_i/G_{i+1} with the map sending G_i/G_{i+1} to (G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H). Therefore, since G_i/G_{i+1} is abelian, its image must be abelian. Hence, (G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H) is abelian, which implies that π(G_i)/π(G_{i+1}) is abelian. Therefore, the series in G/H is a normal series with abelian quotients, hence G/H is solvable.\n\nWait, but the user was trying to use K_i = G_i/(H ∩ G_i). Maybe another approach is to use the natural projection π: G → G/H and note that the image of the solvable series in G would project to a solvable series in G/H. Alternatively, since G is solvable, any quotient group G/H must also be solvable, as solvability is closed under quotients. But the user is trying to construct the series explicitly, so maybe the key is to use the projection of the original normal series.\n\nBut perhaps the user's approach had a different construction. Let me check again. They set K_i = G_i/(H ∩ G_i). Then they considered the series G/H ⊃ K_1 ⊃ ... ⊃ K_r. Wait, but G/H is not exactly the same as K_0. Let me see: If H is a normal subgroup of G, and G_i is a subgroup of G, then H ∩ G_i is a normal subgroup of G_i (since H is normal in G). Therefore, K_i = G_i/(H ∩ G_i) is a quotient group. But how does this fit into G/H?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the correspondence theorem. The subgroups of G/H correspond to subgroups of G containing H. But in the original series, the G_i may not necessarily contain H. So the image of G_i under the projection π: G → G/H is π(G_i) = G_i H / H. Now, since H is normal, G_i H is a subgroup of G. So, the image of each G_i is G_i H / H, which is a subgroup of G/H. Therefore, the series in G/H would be G/H = G_0 H / H ⊇ G_1 H / H ⊇ ... ⊇ G_r H / H = H/H = {e}. Now, each G_{i+1} H is contained in G_i H because G_{i+1} ⊆ G_i. But we need to verify that G_{i+1} H is normal in G_i H. Since G_{i+1} is normal in G_i, then for any g ∈ G_i and h ∈ H, we have g G_{i+1} h = g h (h^{-1} G_{i+1} h) = g h G_{i+1} since H is normal. Wait, but maybe this is not the right way. Let me think: Take any element of G_i H, which is of the form g h where g ∈ G_i and h ∈ H. Then, conjugating G_{i+1} H by g h: (g h)^{-1} G_{i+1} H (g h) = h^{-1} g^{-1} G_{i+1} H g h. Since G_{i+1} is normal in G_i, g^{-1} G_{i+1} g = G_{i+1}, so this becomes h^{-1} G_{i+1} H h. But H is normal in G, so h^{-1} H h = H, and G_{i+1} is a subgroup, so h^{-1} G_{i+1} h is contained in G_{i+1} H? Wait, no, because G_{i+1} might not be normal in H. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, since G_{i+1} is normal in G_i, then G_{i+1} H is normal in G_i H. Because for any g ∈ G_i and h ∈ H, then (g h) G_{i+1} H (g h)^{-1} = g h G_{i+1} H h^{-1} g^{-1} = g G_{i+1} H g^{-1} (since H is normal). Since G_{i+1} is normal in G_i, g G_{i+1} g^{-1} = G_{i+1}, so this becomes G_{i+1} H. Therefore, G_{i+1} H is normal in G_i H. Therefore, the series G_i H / H ⊇ G_{i+1} H / H is such that each term is normal in the previous. \n\nNow, the quotient (G_i H / H) / (G_{i+1} H / H) is isomorphic to (G_i H) / (G_{i+1} H) by the third isomorphism theorem. Now, we need to show this quotient is abelian. Let's see: (G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H) is a quotient of G_i/G_{i+1}, which is abelian. Because G_i/G_{i+1} is abelian, any quotient of it must also be abelian. More formally, there is a surjective homomorphism from G_i/G_{i+1} to (G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H) given by mapping gG_{i+1} to g (G_{i+1} H). The kernel is the set of cosets gG_{i+1} such that g ∈ G_{i+1} H. But since G_{i+1} H is a subgroup containing G_{i+1}, the kernel is (G_{i+1} H)/G_{i+1}. However, the image is (G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H), and since the original group G_i/G_{i+1} is abelian, the image must be abelian. Therefore, the quotient (G_i H)/(G_{i+1} H) is abelian, which implies that the series in G/H has abelian factors. Hence, G/H is solvable.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. Start with the normal abelian tower of G.\n2. Project each subgroup G_i via the natural homomorphism π: G → G/H to get π(G_i) = G_i H / H.\n3. Show that each π(G_{i+1}) is normal in π(G_i}).\n4. Show that the quotient π(G_i)/π(G_{i+1}) is abelian by relating it to G_i/G_{i+1}.\n\nTherefore, the user's approach using K_i = G_i/(H ∩ G_i) might be equivalent to this, but perhaps they need to connect K_i with the image of G_i in G/H. By the second isomorphism theorem, G_i/(H ∩ G_i) ≅ (G_i H)/H, which is exactly π(G_i). Hence, K_i is isomorphic to π(G_i). Therefore, the series they constructed in G/H is indeed a normal series with abelian quotients. So the problem reduces to verifying the normality and the abelian property through this isomorphism.\n\nIn summary, the user's approach is correct, but perhaps they need to use the isomorphism theorems to make the connection between the original series in G and the projected series in G/H. The key point is that the image of a normal series under a surjective homomorphism is a normal series in the image group, and the quotients are images of the original quotients, hence abelian if the originals are abelian.",
