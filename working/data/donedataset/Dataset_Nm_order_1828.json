    "Content": "Let $(a_n)_{n}\\in\\ell^2:=\\ell^2(\\mathbb{R})$ be a fixed sequence. Consider the subspace $$C=\\{(x_n)_{n}\\in\\ell^2 : |x_n|\\le a_n\\text{ for all }n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}.$$ According to the book [Dunford and Schwartz, Linear operators part I , page 453] $C$ is compact in the $\\ell^2$-norm, but there is no proof. How can I show that $C$ is indeed compact in $\\ell^2$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The set $C$ is the image of the compact set $X = [-1,1]^{\\mathbb N}$ (with the product topology) under the map $F: X \\to \\ell^2$, where $F(x)_j = x_j a_j$.  Since the image of a compact Hausdorff space under a continuous map is compact, we just need to show that $F$ is continuous.  Note that $\\Vert F(x) - F(y)\\Vert^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty (x_j - y_j)^2 a_j^2$.  Given $\\varepsilon > 0$, there is $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\sum_{j=N+1}^\\infty a_j^2 < \\varepsilon/8$.  If $x, y \\in X$ with \n$|x_j - y_j|^2 < \\varepsilon/(2\\|a\\|^2)$ for $1 \\le j \\le N$, we have $\\Vert F(x) - F(y)\\Vert ^2 < \\varepsilon$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the set C in ℓ² is compact. From what I remember, in metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to being sequentially compact, which means every sequence in C has a convergent subsequence whose limit is also in C. Alternatively, by the Heine-Borel theorem, in finite-dimensional spaces, closed and bounded sets are compact, but ℓ² is infinite-dimensional, so that theorem doesn't apply here. Instead, maybe I should think about the criteria for compactness in ℓ².\n\nThe set C is defined as all sequences (x_n) in ℓ² such that |x_n| ≤ a_n for each n, where (a_n) is a fixed sequence in ℓ². Wait, since (a_n) is in ℓ², the sum of |a_n|² converges. That might be important. So each term |x_n| is bounded by a_n, which itself is square-summable. \n\nI recall that in infinite-dimensional spaces, closed and totally bounded sets are compact. Total boundedness means that for any ε > 0, there exists a finite number of ε-balls covering the set. How can I show that C is totally bounded? Since each x_n is bounded by a_n, which is in ℓ², maybe we can approximate elements of C by sequences with finite support, truncating after some N terms. Then, for a given ε, choose N such that the tail sum of a_n² beyond N is less than ε². Then, the finite-dimensional part (up to N) is compact because it's a product of closed intervals, hence compact in finite dimensions. Then, the set C can be covered by a finite number of ε-balls around these truncated sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the diagonal argument. Take any sequence in C; since each coordinate is bounded by a_n, which goes to zero (since (a_n) is in ℓ²), then by Tychonoff's theorem, the product of the intervals [-a_n, a_n] is compact in the product topology. But ℓ² topology is stronger than the product topology, so compactness in product topology doesn't imply compactness in ℓ². However, maybe using the fact that (a_n) is in ℓ², we can show that any sequence in C has a subsequence that converges coordinate-wise (by diagonalizing), and then show that this convergence is also in ℓ² norm. \n\nWait, let's think about coordinate-wise convergence first. Suppose we have a sequence of elements x^{(k)} in C. Each x^{(k)} is a sequence (x^{(k)}_n) with |x^{(k)}_n| ≤ a_n. For each fixed n, the sequence x^{(k)}_n is bounded by a_n, so by Bolzano-Weierstrass, there's a convergent subsequence. But since we have infinitely many coordinates, we need to use a diagonal argument to extract a subsequence that converges coordinate-wise for all n. Let’s say we have such a subsequence x^{(k_j)}. Let’s denote the limit as x_n. Then, since |x^{(k_j)}_n| ≤ a_n for all n, the limit x_n must satisfy |x_n| ≤ a_n. So x is in C.\n\nBut now, does x^{(k_j)} converge to x in ℓ² norm? We need to show that the norm of x^{(k_j)} - x goes to zero. The norm squared is the sum over n of |x^{(k_j)}_n - x_n|². Since each term goes to zero, and |x^{(k_j)}_n - x_n|² ≤ (2a_n)², which is summable because a_n is in ℓ². By the dominated convergence theorem, the sum converges to zero. Therefore, x^{(k_j)} converges to x in ℓ². Hence, C is sequentially compact, thus compact.\n\nBut I need to make sure all the steps are valid. Let me verify the application of the dominated convergence theorem. We have |x^{(k_j)}_n - x_n|² ≤ 4a_n², which is summable. And for each n, |x^{(k_j)}_n - x_n|² → 0 as j→infty. So yes, the sum goes to zero by DCT. Therefore, C is compact.\n\nSo the key assumptions are that (a_n) is in ℓ², and C consists of all sequences bounded by a_n coordinate-wise. Therefore, the problem is to show that under these conditions, C is compact in ℓ².",
