    "Content": "Let $f(x) \\in C^2[0,1]$, with $f(0)=f(1)=0$, and $f(x)\\neq 0$ when $x \\in(0,1)$. Show that\n$$\\int_0^1 \\left| \\frac{f''(x)}{f(x)} \\right| dx \\geq 4.$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's another answer, which avoids reducing to the case in which $f$ is concave. It is plainly enough to prove that $$\n\\sup_{x \\in [0,1]}{|f(x)|} \\leq \\frac{1}{4}I,\\quad \\text{where} \\quad I := \\int_0^1|f''(x)|\\,dx. \\tag{1}\n$$ First of all, since $f(0) = f(1) = 0$ and $f$ is nonzero in $(0,1)$ , we know that the supremum on the left-hand side is attained at some $c \\in (0,1)$ , and moreover, that $f'(c) = 0$ . By using Taylor's theorem with remainder of integral form (which is really just repeated integration by parts) to expand $f$ around the point $c$ , we have $$\nf(x) = f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + \\int_c^x (x - t)f''(t)\\,dt\n = f(c) + \\int_c^x (x - t)f''(t)\\,dt,\n$$ for any $x \\in [0,1]$ . Successively taking $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ gives $$\nf(c) = -\\int_0^c tf''(t)\\,dt = -\\int_c^1 (1-t)f''(t)\\,dt,\n$$ because $f(0) = f(1) = 0$ . This means that $$\n|f(c)| \\leq c\\int_0^c |f''(t)|\\,dt \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |f(c)| \\leq (1-c) \\int_c^1 |f''(t)|\\,dt. \\tag{2}\n$$ Since $$\n\\int_0^c|f''(t)|\\,dt + \\int_c^1|f''(t)|\\,dt = I = (1-c)I + cI,\n$$ we must have either $\\int_0^c|f''(t)|\\,dt \\leq (1-c) I$ or $\\int_c^1|f''(t)|\\,dt \\leq c I$ . Either way $(2)$ shows that $$\n|f(c)| \\leq c(1-c)I = \\frac{1}{4}I - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - c\\right)^2I \\leq \\frac{1}{4}I,\n$$ and $(1)$ is therefore proved.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided involved breaking down the problem's assumptions and restating the problem concisely. So I need to do the same for the integral inequality problem from Math Stack Exchange.\n\nFirst, let me read the original problem again. The problem states: Let f(x) be in C²[0,1], meaning it's twice continuously differentiable on the interval [0,1]. The boundary conditions are f(0) = f(1) = 0. Also, f(x) is not zero for any x in (0,1). The task is to show that the integral of the absolute value of f''(x)/f(x) from 0 to 1 is at least 4.\n\nNow, I need to list all the assumptions, each on a separate line, addressing one property per line for one object. The object here is the function f(x). Let's break down the conditions given:\n\n1. The function f is in C²[0,1]. That means it's twice continuously differentiable on the interval [0,1]. So one assumption is f ∈ C²[0,1].\n\n2. The function satisfies f(0) = 0. That's a boundary condition at x=0.\n\n3. Similarly, f(1) = 0 is another boundary condition at x=1.\n\n4. The function is non-zero on the open interval (0,1). So f(x) ≠ 0 for all x in (0,1). That’s important because we’re dividing by f(x) in the integrand, so we need to ensure we're not dividing by zero anywhere in (0,1).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to the function f. So I should list them line by line.\n\nThe problem statement then is to show that the integral of |f''(x)/f(x)| dx from 0 to 1 is at least 4.\n\nI need to make sure that in the formatted problem, the problem is restated clearly. Let me check if there's any other implicit assumptions. For example, the function being non-zero in (0,1) ensures the integrand is defined everywhere in the open interval. Also, the continuity of f'' and f implies that the integrand is continuous on (0,1), but since we have absolute value, we need to make sure the integral makes sense. But since f is C² and non-zero, the integrand is continuous on (0,1). The integral's behavior at the endpoints (0 and 1) might need attention because f(0) and f(1) are zero, but since f is non-zero in between, and f is twice differentiable, the limit as x approaches 0 or 1 of |f''(x)/f(x)| might exist or blow up. However, the problem statement just gives the integral from 0 to 1, so the assumptions must ensure that the integral is convergent. But perhaps that's part of the problem's conditions as given.\n\nSo the key assumptions are the differentiability class, boundary conditions, and non-vanishing in the open interval. So I'll list them each as separate lines.\n\nLet me verify against the example. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each on its own line. Here, we have four assumptions? Wait, f ∈ C²[0,1], f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f(x)≠0 on (0,1). So four points. But in the example, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like an error. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might have been a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the user wanted to filter out some conditions. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example had a hidden assumption? Wait, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. Then the formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that would make the problem different. Maybe the example had a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem states all the conditions: f ∈ C²[0,1], f(0)=f(1)=0, f(x)≠0 on (0,1). So those are the explicit assumptions given. So each should be a separate line in the assumption section.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf ∈ C²[0,1],\nf(0) = 0,\nf(1) = 0,\nf(x) ≠ 0 for all x ∈ (0,1).\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_0^1 \\left| \\frac{f''(x)}{f(x)} \\right| dx \\geq 4.$$\n\nThat should be the structured problem as per the required format. I need to make sure that each assumption is on its own line and addresses one property. Also, check that all the conditions from the original problem are included and no extra assumptions are added. Since the original problem didn't mention anything else, like specific behaviors at endpoints beyond the boundary conditions, or additional constraints on f, those four assumptions are the ones to list.",
