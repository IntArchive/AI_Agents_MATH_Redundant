    "Content": "Well, the original task was to figure out what the following expression evaluates to for any $n$. $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}^{\\large n}$$ By trying out different values of $n$, I found the pattern:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}^{\\large n} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$$ But I have yet to figure out how to prove it algebraically. Suggestions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Use induction on $n$. (1) Prove the base case (trivial), perhaps even establish the case for $n = 2$ (two base cases here are not necessary, but as you found, it helps reveal the pattern.) (2) Then assume it holds for $n = k$. (3) Finally, show that from this assumption, it holds for $n = k+1$. You've established the base case(s). Now, (2) assume the inductive hypothesis (IH) $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}^k = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.$$ Then, $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^{k + 1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}^k \\quad \\overset{IH}{=} \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\quad\\cdots$$ I think you can take it from here!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the matrix [[1,1],[0,1]] raised to the nth power equals [[1,n],[0,1]]. They noticed the pattern by trying different n values but need an algebraic proof.\n\nFirst, I should recall how matrix exponentiation works. Since this is a 2x2 matrix, maybe induction would work. Let me test base cases. For n=1, it's obvious. Assume it's true for n=k, then show for n=k+1. Multiply the matrix by [[1,k],[0,1]] and see if it becomes [[1,k+1],[0,1]]. The multiplication would be:\n\n1*1 + 1*0 = 1 (top-left)\n1*k + 1*1 = k+1 (top-right)\n0*1 + 1*0 = 0 (bottom-left)\n0*k + 1*1 = 1 (bottom-right)\n\nYes, that works. So induction proves it. Alternatively, maybe using eigenvalues or diagonalization, but since the matrix is not diagonalizable (only eigenvalue 1, Jordan block), induction seems the simplest approach. The key assumption here is that n is a positive integer. The problem might also hold for n=0 if we consider the identity matrix, but the original question probably assumes n is a positive integer. So the assumptions should list that n is an integer, and maybe n is non-negative? But the original problem says \"for any n\", which could include n=0. However, in the induction step, we start from n=1. But to be precise, the user's example in the question didn't mention n=0. The problem as stated in the title just says \"for any n\", which could be any integer. Wait, but matrix powers are typically defined for positive integers. If n is negative, it would require the inverse, but the inverse of this matrix is [[1,-1],[0,1]], and raising it to the power -n would give [[1,-n],[0,1]], so the formula holds for all integers n if we interpret it correctly. But the original problem might just be for non-negative integers. So the assumption here is that n is an integer. The problem is to prove the formula. So in formatting, the assumptions would be that n is an integer. The problem is to show the equality. The example given in the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the key assumption is just that n is an integer. So the formatted problem should list \"n is an integer\" as the assumption. The problem is to show the matrix equality. The user probably doesn't have other hidden conditions. So the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}^n = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$$ for any integer n.\n\nWait, but the user's original problem didn't specify any restrictions on n, just \"for any n\". But in the context of matrices, exponentiation to integer powers requires invertibility for negative exponents. However, the matrix in question is invertible (determinant 1), so negative exponents are possible. However, the user's initial trials might have been with positive n. The problem statement in the title says \"for any n\", so probably all integers. But maybe the user is considering non-negative integers. However, since the problem is as stated, the assumption is just that n is an integer. If the user wants to include all integers, then the assumption is n is an integer. If the problem is only for positive integers, then that should be specified. However, the original problem's title says \"for any n\", so the assumption should be n is an integer. The problem is to prove the equality. So the formatted version is as above.",
