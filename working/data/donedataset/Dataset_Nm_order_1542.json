    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $x=(1+s)/2$, so that the expression becomes\n$$ \\frac{n}{2^{n+1}} \\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{(1+s)^n-(1-s)^n}{s} ds =\n\\frac{n}{2^{n}} \\int_{0}^1 \\frac{(1+s)^n-(1-s)^n}{s} ds. $$\n(The integrand is an even function.)\nFix some $c$ between 0 and 1, say $c=1-\\epsilon$.\nThen the integral from 0 to $c$ will be small in comparison to $2^n$,\nsince the integrand is bounded by a constant times $(1+c)^n$,\nso as far as the limit is concerned it is enough to look at the\nintegral from $c$ to 1,\nand in that integral we can neglect the term $(1-s)^n$ since it will\nalso contribute something much smaller than $2^n$.\nThe surviving contribution therefore comes from\n$$ \\int_c^1 \\frac{(1+s)^n}{s} ds, $$\nwhich lies between\n$$ \\int_c^1 \\frac{(1+s)^n}{1} ds $$\nand\n$$ \\int_c^1 \\frac{(1+s)^n}{c} ds, $$\nthat is,\n$$ \\frac{2^{n+1} - (1+c)^{n+1}}{n+1} < \\int_c^1 \\frac{(1+s)^n}{s} ds < \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{2^{n+1} - (1+c)^{n+1}}{n+1} .$$\nMultiplying by $n/2^n$ and letting $n\\to\\infty$ shows that the liminf\nis at least 2 and the limsup is at most $2/c$.\nBut since this holds for any $c$ between 0 and 1,\nit follows that liminf=limsup=2, hence the limit is 2.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The limit as n approaches infinity of n times the integral from 0 to 1 of [x^n - (1-x)^n]/(2x-1) dx equals 2. The question mentions that this has been shown using two steps involving a summation and its limit, but the user is asking for an alternative proof, preferably analytic.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to 1, and n is a positive integer approaching infinity. The integrand is [x^n - (1-x)^n]/(2x -1). The problem is about finding the limit of n times this integral.\n\nWait, the example in the original query had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem involves n approaching infinity, which is a limit condition. But are there specific assumptions on n here? The integral is defined for n as a positive integer, since the integral is evaluated for x in [0,1] and 2x-1 is in the denominator. However, at x=0.5, the denominator becomes zero. So maybe there's an assumption about the integral being improper, but the problem doesn't specify that. Wait, the original integral from 0 to 1 of [x^n - (1-x)^n]/(2x -1) dx. At x=1/2, the denominator is zero. But when n is an integer, x^n and (1-x)^n would both be (1/2)^n there. So the numerator becomes (1/2)^n - (1/2)^n = 0. So the integrand has a removable discontinuity at x=1/2. Therefore, the integral is proper. So maybe the assumption is that the integral is treated as a proper integral with the point at x=1/2 handled by continuity. Also, n is a positive integer approaching infinity. So assumptions here would include that n is a positive integer, and the integral is evaluated over [0,1] considering the removable discontinuity at x=1/2.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this problem, the main assumptions would be that n is a positive integer and perhaps the integrand is defined properly by continuity at x=1/2. But the problem as stated just presents the integral, so perhaps the key assumptions are n is a positive integer, and the integral is computed over [0,1] with the integrand as given. However, since the limit is as n approaches infinity, maybe we need to note that n is tending to infinity. But in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer. So perhaps here, the assumptions are that n is a positive integer and the integral is taken over the interval [0,1].\n\nWait, but the user wants each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0,1],\nThe integrand is defined at x=1/2 by continuity.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly mention the integral being improper or handling x=1/2. However, since the integral is given as is, perhaps the key assumption is that the integral is properly defined, which would require that the integrand's singularity at x=1/2 is removable. So that's a necessary condition for the integral to exist. Therefore, the assumption would be that the integrand is defined by its continuous extension at x=1/2.\n\nBut how does the original question state it? The user just presents the integral as written, and the problem is to compute the limit. So perhaps the assumptions are n is a positive integer, and the integrand is treated as continuous at x=1/2. Each of these is a separate line.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe integrand is defined by continuity at x=1/2,\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - (1-x)^n}{2x-1} \\mathrm dx = 2.$$\n\nBut wait, in the original example, the assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is for n approaching infinity, but the integral is defined for each n as a positive integer. So the key assumptions here are that n is a positive integer and the integrand is properly defined (i.e., continuous at x=1/2). However, the integrand's continuity at x=1/2 comes from the numerator being zero there, so perhaps that's inherent in the problem setup. Maybe the problem assumes that, so the user doesn't have to state it, but according to the instructions, we need to list all assumptions, each as a single line. Therefore, including that would make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated in the original question doesn't mention anything about the integrand's behavior at x=1/2, but when structuring, we need to include any necessary assumptions for the problem to be well-posed. So in this case, the integral must be proper, which requires the integrand to be continuous on [0,1], which is only possible if we define it by continuity at x=1/2. Hence, that's an assumption needed for the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe integrand is defined by continuity at x=1/2,\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - (1-x)^n}{2x-1} \\mathrm dx = 2.$$\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral being evaluated over [0,1] is already given in the problem, so that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the problem statement included the expression A(n), and the assumption listed was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So the integral's interval [0,1] is part of the problem, not an assumption, while the assumptions are about the variables involved.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\nn is a positive integer,\nThe integrand is defined by continuity at x=1/2.\n\nBecause the integral being over [0,1] is part of the problem's integral, not an assumption. The problem statement includes the integral from 0 to 1.\n\nSo the user's example had the problem statement include the expression, and the assumptions listed properties of n. So following that, the assumptions here would be that n is a positive integer and the integrand is defined by continuity at x=1/2. Each on a separate line.\n\nTherefore, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe integrand is defined by continuity at x=1/2.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - (1-x)^n}{2x-1} \\mathrm dx = 2.$$\n\nThis seems to fit the example's structure, where assumptions are properties of variables involved. The integral's domain is part of the problem statement.",
