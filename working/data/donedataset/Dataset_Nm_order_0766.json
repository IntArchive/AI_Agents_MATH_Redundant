    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $g=f+f'+\\cdots+f^{(n)}$ and let $h(x)=e^{-x}g(x)$. Note that $f^{(n+1)}=0$, so\n$$h'(x)=e^{-x}(g'(x)-g(x))=-e^{-x}f(x)\\le 0,$$ \ni.e. $h$ is decrearing on $\\mathbb R$.\nSince $g$ is a polynomial, $\\lim\\limits_{x\\to+\\infty}h(x)=0$. It follows that $h\\ge 0$, and hence $g\\ge 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem thoroughly.\n\nThe original title is: \"Prove that If $f$ is polynomial function of even degree $n$ with always $f\\geq0$ then $f+f'+f''+\\cdots+f^{(n)}\\geq 0$.\" The user also provided an example of how to format a similar problem. My task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that $f$ is a polynomial function of even degree $n$. Additionally, it mentions that $f$ is always non-negative ($f \\geq 0$). These are the primary conditions. Each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So, breaking it down:\n\n1. $f$ is a polynomial function.\n2. The degree of $f$ is $n$.\n3. $n$ is an even integer.\n4. $f(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$.\n\nThese are the individual assumptions. Each line addresses a single condition. The problem then is to prove that the sum $f + f' + f'' + \\cdots + f^{(n)}$ is non-negative.\n\nI need to check if there are any hidden assumptions. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the coefficients of the polynomial or the domain (like real numbers), but since it's a polynomial function and the condition $f \\geq 0$ is for all $x$, it's implied that we're dealing with real polynomials over the real numbers. However, the example provided in the user's query didn't include implicit assumptions unless stated. The original problem doesn't mention the domain, so maybe we shouldn't add that. The key is to only include explicitly stated conditions.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n- $f$ is a polynomial function.\n- The degree of $f$ is $n$.\n- $n$ is even.\n- $f(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$.\n\nThen, the problem statement is to prove that the sum of the function and its first $n$ derivatives is non-negative.\n\nWait, the problem says \"of even degree $n$\" which implies that $n$ is even. So maybe combining the degree and the parity into one assumption? But according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property. For example, in the sample, they separated \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So here, \"degree of $f$ is $n$\" is one assumption, and \"n is even\" is another. Even though in the problem statement it's written as \"even degree $n$\", breaking it into two separate conditions would align with the example's structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct split would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a polynomial function.\n- The degree of $f$ is $n$.\n- $n$ is an even integer.\n- $f(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $f + f' + f'' + \\cdots + f^{(n)} \\geq 0$.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other assumptions. The problem doesn't mention anything else. So this should be correct. The key is to list each condition on separate lines, each addressing a single property of one object. The object here is $f$, and its properties are being a polynomial, having degree $n$, $n$ being even, and $f$ being non-negative everywhere.",
