    "Content": "For the last couple of days I've been doing a lot of group theory problems, but I found the following particularly difficult, and quite interesting. My level is up to an introductionary course in group theory excluding Sylow Theory. I've made a big edit to include all the work done this far and exclude non-relevant parts. Let $G$ be a non-abelian group such that all normal subgroups are trivial (i.e. the only normal subgroups are $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ itself). Prove the following. a. $G\\cong\\mathrm{Inn}(G)$ b. If $\\psi\\in\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ and $\\forall\\varphi\\in\\mathrm{Inn}(G), \\ \\psi\\circ\\varphi=\\varphi\\circ\\psi$ , then $\\psi=\\mathrm{id}_G$ . c. If $N\\lhd\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ such that $N\\cap\\mathrm{Inn}(G)=\\{\\mathrm{id}_G\\}$ , then $N=\\{\\mathrm{id}_G\\}$ . d. $\\mathrm{Inn}(G)\\ char \\ \\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ e. $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathrm{Aut}(G))=\\mathrm{Inn}(\\mathrm{Aut}(G))\\cong\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ a. Since $Z(G)\\lhd G $ , either $Z(G)=\\{e\\}$ or $Z(G)=G$ . In the latter case $G$ is abelian, which is not the case, thus $Z(G)=\\{e\\}$ , and it follows that $\\mathrm{Inn}(G)\\cong G/Z(G)\\cong G$ . b. Elaborating on the comments by Max and Servaes, we see that the given identity yields $\\psi(g)\\psi(a)\\psi(g^{-1})=g\\psi(a)g^{-1}$ and from there $g^{-1}\\psi(g)\\psi(a)=\\psi(a)g^{-1}\\psi(g)$ . Since $\\psi\\in\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ , $\\psi$ is bijective (thus surjective), and thus $\\forall g\\in G \\ g^{-1}\\psi(g)\\in Z(G)=\\{e\\}$ , thus $g=\\psi(g)$ for all $g\\in G$ , so $\\psi=\\mathrm{id}_G$ c. Suppose $N\\lhd\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ such that $N\\cap\\mathrm{Inn}(G)=\\{\\mathrm{id}_G\\}$ . Since $\\mathrm{Inn}(G)\\lhd\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ and the intersection between both normal subgroups is trivial, $\\forall\\varphi\\in\\mathrm{Inn}(G)\\ \\forall \\psi\\in N, \\ \\ \\psi\\circ\\varphi=\\varphi\\circ\\psi$ , thus by applying part b conclude that $\\psi=\\mathrm{id_G}$ if $\\psi\\in N$ , thus $N=\\{\\mathrm{id}_G\\}$ indeed. d. Is worked out by Servaes. e. The last part that remains. Some conjectured that part e) might contain a typo, but I don't think so. I managed to proof the following: we know from part b) that if $\\psi\\in\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ commutes with all $\\chi\\in\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ , then certainly $\\psi$ commutes with all $\\varphi\\in\\mathrm{Inn}(G)\\subset\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ . So $Z(\\mathrm{Aut}(G))=\\{\\mathrm{id}_G\\}$ , and thus $\\mathrm{Inn}(\\mathrm{Aut}(G))\\cong\\mathrm{Aut}(G)/Z(\\mathrm{Aut}(G))\\cong\\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ . The only thing that remains to be proven is that $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathrm{Aut}(G))=\\mathrm{Inn}(\\mathrm{Aut}(G))$ , for a simple non-abelian group the automorphism group is complete. According to Wikipedia , this should be true, but I've no idea how to prove this, but I guess it might follow quite easily. I would appreciate it a lot if someone could write a proof for this very last part.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For part b: Such a map $h$ does not exist in general. For example, the group $A_5$ is simple with $\\operatorname{Aut}(A_5)=S_5$, but there is no surjective homomorphism $h:\\ S_5\\ \\longrightarrow\\ A_5$. The intended approach seems to be this: If $\\psi\\circ\\varphi=\\varphi\\circ\\psi$ for all $\\varphi\\in\\operatorname{Inn}(G)$, then for all $g,h\\in G$\n$$\\psi(ghg^{-1})=g\\psi(h)g^{-1},$$\nwhich can be rearranged to \n$$g^{-1}\\psi(g)\\ \\psi(h)=\\psi(h)\\ g^{-1}\\psi(g).$$\nBecause $\\psi$ is surjective this implies that $g^{-1}\\psi(g)\\in Z(G)$ for all $g\\in G$. You've already shown that $Z(G)=\\{e\\}$, and so it follows that $\\psi=\\operatorname{id}_G$. For part d: Let $\\chi\\in\\operatorname{Aut}(\\operatorname{Aut}(G))$ and let $N:=\\chi(G)$. Because $G$ is simple and $\\operatorname{Inn}(G)\\cong G$, we have either $N\\cap\\operatorname{Inn}(G)=\\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ or $N\\cap\\operatorname{Inn}(G)=\\{\\operatorname{id}_G\\}$. The latter would, by part c, imply that $N=\\{\\operatorname{id}_G\\}$ which is clearly impossible. Hence $N\\cap\\operatorname{Inn}(G)=\\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ and so $N=\\operatorname{Inn}(G)$. For part e: [This fails for $A_6$, so there must be a typo.] EDIT: I am unsure about this part.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Aut(Aut(G)) ≅ Aut(G) for G a non-abelian simple group\". The user is working through several parts of a problem involving automorphism groups of a non-abelian simple group. They've already solved parts a to d and are stuck on part e, which asks to prove that Aut(Aut(G)) is isomorphic to Aut(G), specifically showing that Aut(Aut(G)) equals Inn(Aut(G)) and hence is isomorphic to Aut(G).\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement for part e. The original problem mentions that G is a non-abelian group with all normal subgroups trivial, which means G is a non-abelian simple group. The user has already established some properties in parts a to d, like Inn(G) being isomorphic to G, the center of Aut(G) being trivial, and Inn(G) being a characteristic subgroup of Aut(G).\n\nFor part e, the key points are:\n- G is a non-abelian simple group.\n- The goal is to prove that Aut(Aut(G)) is isomorphic to Inn(Aut(G)), which in turn is isomorphic to Aut(G).\n\nThe user mentions that they know Inn(Aut(G)) is isomorphic to Aut(G)/Z(Aut(G)), and since Z(Aut(G)) is trivial (from part b and d), this simplifies to Inn(Aut(G)) ≅ Aut(G). The remaining part is showing that every automorphism of Aut(G) is inner, i.e., Aut(Aut(G)) = Inn(Aut(G)). \n\nAssumptions here would be:\n1. G is a non-abelian simple group.\n2. Inn(G) is a characteristic subgroup of Aut(G) (from part d).\n3. The center of Aut(G) is trivial (from part b).\n\nThe problem statement for part e is to prove that Aut(Aut(G)) is isomorphic to Aut(G), which boils down to showing that all automorphisms of Aut(G) are inner, hence Aut(Aut(G)) ≅ Inn(Aut(G)) ≅ Aut(G).\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\n- G is a non-abelian simple group.\n- Inn(G) is a characteristic subgroup of Aut(G).\n- The center of Aut(G) is trivial.\n\nProblem: Prove that Aut(Aut(G)) ≅ Aut(G).\n\nWait, but the original part e is stated as \"Aut(Aut(G))=Inn(Aut(G)) ≅ Aut(G)\". So maybe the problem is to show that Aut(Aut(G)) is equal to Inn(Aut(G)), which is isomorphic to Aut(G). But in the formatted example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". So here, the problem should be phrased as proving the isomorphism Aut(Aut(G)) ≅ Aut(G), under the given assumptions.\n\nBut let me check the example again. The example included the assumptions from the problem, even if some were derived. In the original problem, part e is part of a series where each part builds on the previous. The user has already proven parts a-d, so part e relies on those results. However, in the formatted example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's setup. Here, the user specifies G is a non-abelian simple group (trivial normal subgroups), so that's the primary assumption.\n\nBut in part e, the problem is specifically to prove Aut(Aut(G)) ≅ Aut(G). The assumptions needed are that G is a non-abelian simple group, and the previous parts (a-d) have established certain properties. However, since the format requires listing each assumption line by line, I need to include all necessary conditions that are given or proven in prior parts relevant to part e.\n\nLooking at the original problem's part e, the user mentions that from part b, Z(Aut(G)) is trivial, and from part d, Inn(G) is a characteristic subgroup of Aut(G). So these are conditions that are already established and necessary for proving part e. Therefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- G is a non-abelian simple group.\n- Inn(G) is a characteristic subgroup of Aut(G).\n- The center of Aut(G) is trivial.\n\nBut wait, the center being trivial comes from part b. The problem is that the original question is part e of a multi-part question. In the example given, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which was part of the problem's setup. Here, the main assumption is that G is a non-abelian simple group. The other conditions (Inn(G) being characteristic in Aut(G), Z(Aut(G)) being trivial) are results from previous parts. However, in the problem statement for part e, the user is to use those results. So should those results be listed as assumptions here?\n\nThe example provided by the user includes the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which is part of the problem's original conditions, not derived in previous parts. But in the case of the current problem, part e is a follow-up question where previous parts have established certain properties. However, the format requires listing all assumptions. If we consider the original problem's setup, G is non-abelian simple (so trivial normal subgroups), and that's the main assumption. The other parts (a-d) establish other properties, but if we're to format part e's problem, we need to include only the given assumptions, not the derived ones unless they are given as part of the problem's premises.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Let G be a non-abelian group such that all normal subgroups are trivial (i.e., the only normal subgroups are {e} and G itself). Prove the following...\" So part e is under this assumption. The other parts (a-d) are proven under that same assumption. So for part e, the main assumption is that G is a non-abelian simple group. The other properties (like Inn(G) ≅ G, etc.) are derived from that.\n\nHowever, when the user asks for part e, they might have to assume the previous parts' conclusions. But in the example given, the formatted problem included the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's original setup. So perhaps here, the assumption is just G is a non-abelian simple group, and the problem is to prove part e. But maybe to include that Inn(G) is characteristic in Aut(G) and Z(Aut(G)) is trivial, as those are necessary for the proof. However, since the user is supposed to extract the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question, which includes the original problem's parts and the user's progress, I need to see what exactly is part e's problem.\n\nLooking at the original problem's part e: \"e. Aut(Aut(G))=Inn(Aut(G))≅Aut(G)\". The user is asking to prove this. So the problem is part e, which is to show that the automorphism group of Aut(G) is equal to the inner automorphism group of Aut(G), which is isomorphic to Aut(G).\n\nThe necessary assumptions for part e are:\n\n- G is a non-abelian simple group (given in the problem statement).\n- Inn(G) is a characteristic subgroup of Aut(G) (proven in part d).\n- The center of Aut(G) is trivial (proven in part b).\n\nThese are the key assumptions needed to establish that Aut(G) is a complete group (trivial center and every automorphism is inner), hence Aut(Aut(G)) ≅ Inn(Aut(G)) ≅ Aut(G). \n\nSo the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then the problem statement.",
