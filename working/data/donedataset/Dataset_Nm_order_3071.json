    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the integral of sqrt(4 + x²) from 3 to 5 is between 8.9 and 9. They mentioned that directly computing the integral gives a complicated expression, which is hard to approximate. So, the idea is to find upper and lower bounds for the integrand function that are easier to integrate, right?\n\nFirst, I need to recall that sqrt(4 + x²) is a function that's increasing on the interval [3,5] because its derivative, x/sqrt(4 + x²), is positive for all x > 0. So, since the function is increasing, maybe I can use linear approximations or tangent lines to bound it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use concave or convex properties? Let me check the second derivative. The first derivative is x/sqrt(4 + x²), so the second derivative would be [sqrt(4 + x²) - x*(x/sqrt(4 + x²))]/(4 + x²) = [ (4 + x²) - x² ] / (4 + x²)^(3/2) ) = 4/(4 + x²)^(3/2), which is always positive. Therefore, the function is convex on the interval [3,5]. \n\nIf the function is convex, then the graph of the function lies above any of its tangent lines. So, maybe using tangent lines at specific points to get lower bounds, and secant lines to get upper bounds? Wait, for a convex function, the secant line between two points lies above the function. Wait, no. Let me recall: for a convex function, the chord between two points lies above the function. Wait, actually, for a convex function, the function lies below the chord. Wait, no. Wait, convexity means that for any two points, the line segment connecting them lies above the graph of the function. So, if the function is convex, then the average of the function at two points is greater than the function at the average point. Hmm, perhaps I should draw a picture mentally. If f is convex, then between x=a and x=b, the chord connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) lies above the graph of f. So, integrating the chord would give an upper bound for the integral of f. Similarly, for a convex function, maybe the tangent lines lie below the function. Wait, tangent lines at any point on a convex function lie below the function. So, if I can find tangent lines at certain points in [3,5], then integrating those would give lower bounds. But since the function is convex, the minimum slope of the tangent lines would be at the left endpoint, and maximum slope at the right endpoint? Wait, actually, for a convex function, the derivative is increasing. So, the tangent lines at points in [3,5] will have slopes increasing from left to right. Therefore, the tangent line at x=3 will have the smallest slope, and the tangent line at x=5 will have the steepest slope. But if the function is convex, then the tangent line at any point x=c in [3,5] lies below the function for all x in [3,5]. Wait, is that true? Let me recall: For a convex function, the tangent line at any point c lies below the function everywhere. So yes, if f is convex, then f(x) ≥ f(c) + f’(c)(x - c) for all x. Therefore, if I take tangent lines at different points, I can get lower bounds. For example, if I take the tangent line at x=3, that will lie below f(x) on [3,5], so integrating that tangent line would give a lower bound. Similarly, tangent line at x=5 would also lie below f(x), but maybe integrating that over [3,5] gives a better lower bound? Wait, but since the function is increasing and convex, the tangent line at x=3 might be a worse lower bound compared to another approach. Alternatively, maybe using linear functions that pass through points (3, f(3)) and (5, f(5)), but that's the chord, which for convex functions lies above the graph. So integrating the chord would give an upper bound, and integrating the tangent lines at endpoints might give lower bounds. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nFirst, compute f(3) and f(5). f(3) = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13) ≈ 3.6055, f(5) = sqrt(4 + 25) = sqrt(29) ≈ 5.3852.\n\nThe chord connecting (3, f(3)) and (5, f(5)) would be a straight line with slope (f(5) - f(3))/(5 - 3) = (sqrt(29) - sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (5.3852 - 3.6055)/2 ≈ 1.7797/2 ≈ 0.8898. The equation of the chord is y = f(3) + slope*(x - 3). So, integrating this chord from 3 to 5 would be the area of a trapezoid, which is (f(3) + f(5))/2 * (5 - 3) = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(29))/2 * 2 = sqrt(13) + sqrt(29) ≈ 3.6055 + 5.3852 ≈ 8.9907. Wait, that's very close to 9. Since the chord is an upper bound for the integral (because the function is convex), so integrating the chord gives an upper bound of approximately 8.99, which is just under 9. So that explains the upper bound of 9. But the problem states the integral is less than 9, so this seems to fit. However, the user says that they have to show the integral is between 8.9 and 9, so maybe the chord gives the upper bound of 9, and we need another way to get the lower bound.\n\nBut wait, the calculation above gives the trapezoidal estimate as approximately 8.99, which is very close to 9. But the problem states the upper bound is 9, so perhaps using the chord gives exactly sqrt(13) + sqrt(29), which is approximately 8.99, and since sqrt(13) ≈ 3.6055 and sqrt(29) ≈ 5.3852, adding them gives 8.9907, which is just under 9. So perhaps rounding up, they can say it's less than 9. But the problem states that it's less than 9, so maybe the exact value is less than 9.\n\nBut how to get the lower bound of 8.9? The user mentioned using Taylor series but is concerned about getting actual bounds. Alternatively, maybe using the tangent line at the midpoint or some other point to get a lower bound. Let me think. Since the function is convex, the tangent line at any point will lie below the function. So, integrating a tangent line over [3,5] will give a lower bound. Let's try the tangent line at x=4, the midpoint.\n\nFirst, compute f(4) = sqrt(4 + 16) = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.4721. The derivative f’(x) = x / sqrt(4 + x²). So f’(4) = 4 / sqrt(20) = 4 / (2*sqrt(5)) = 2/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.8944. The tangent line at x=4 is y = f(4) + f’(4)(x - 4) ≈ 4.4721 + 0.8944*(x - 4). Let's integrate this from 3 to 5. The integral of a linear function is straightforward. The equation is y = 0.8944x + (4.4721 - 0.8944*4). Let's compute the constant term: 4.4721 - 0.8944*4 ≈ 4.4721 - 3.5776 ≈ 0.8945. So the tangent line is y ≈ 0.8944x + 0.8945. Integrating from 3 to 5:\n\nIntegral ≈ [0.4472x² + 0.8945x] from 3 to 5.\n\nAt x=5: 0.4472*(25) + 0.8945*5 ≈ 11.18 + 4.4725 ≈ 15.6525\n\nAt x=3: 0.4472*(9) + 0.8945*3 ≈ 4.0248 + 2.6835 ≈ 6.7083\n\nSo the integral ≈ 15.6525 - 6.7083 ≈ 8.9442. Hmm, that's about 8.94, which is above 8.9. So integrating the tangent line at x=4 gives a lower bound of approximately 8.94, which is higher than 8.9. So perhaps this isn't sufficient. Wait, but maybe the tangent line at another point gives a lower lower bound. For example, the tangent line at x=3.\n\nCompute f’(3) = 3 / sqrt(13) ≈ 3 / 3.6055 ≈ 0.83205. The tangent line at x=3 is y = f(3) + f’(3)(x - 3) ≈ 3.6055 + 0.83205*(x - 3). Let's integrate this from 3 to 5:\n\nIntegral = [3.6055x + 0.83205*(x²/2 - 3x)] from 3 to 5.\n\nBut maybe easier to compute the definite integral. The linear function is y = 0.83205x + (3.6055 - 0.83205*3). Compute the constant term: 3.6055 - 2.49615 ≈ 1.10935. So the tangent line is y ≈ 0.83205x + 1.10935. Integrating from 3 to 5:\n\nIntegral ≈ [0.83205*(5²)/2 + 1.10935*5] - [0.83205*(3²)/2 + 1.10935*3]\n\nCompute at 5: 0.83205*(25/2) + 1.10935*5 ≈ 0.83205*12.5 + 5.54675 ≈ 10.4006 + 5.54675 ≈ 15.94735\n\nAt 3: 0.83205*(9/2) + 1.10935*3 ≈ 0.83205*4.5 + 3.32805 ≈ 3.7442 + 3.32805 ≈ 7.07225\n\nIntegral ≈ 15.94735 - 7.07225 ≈ 8.8751 ≈ 8.88. So integrating the tangent line at x=3 gives a lower bound of approximately 8.88, which is below 8.9. So this would not meet the required 8.9 lower bound. Therefore, maybe this approach isn't tight enough. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a piecewise linear approximation. For instance, divide the interval [3,5] into subintervals, compute tangent lines on each, and sum the integrals. But that might complicate things.\n\nWait, another idea: since the function is convex, maybe we can use the trapezoidal rule as an upper bound and the midpoint rule as a lower bound. Wait, the trapezoidal rule overestimates for convex functions, and the midpoint rule underestimates. Let me verify. For a convex function, the trapezoidal rule (which uses the average of the endpoints) gives an overestimate because the function lies below the chord. Wait, but earlier we saw that integrating the chord gives an upper bound. So the trapezoidal rule would give (f(a) + f(b))/2 * (b - a) which is the same as integrating the chord. So that's an upper bound. The midpoint rule uses the value at the midpoint times the interval. For convex functions, the midpoint rule underestimates the integral. Because the area of the rectangle with height f((a+b)/2) is less than the integral of the convex function. So if I compute the midpoint rule as a lower bound. Let's compute that.\n\nMidpoint rule: f(4)*(5 - 3) = sqrt(20)*2 ≈ 4.4721*2 ≈ 8.9442, which is the same as the tangent line at x=4 integral. Hmm, interesting. So midpoint rule gives 8.9442, which is a lower bound. But this is higher than 8.9. So maybe combining this with another method?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Taylor series expansion of sqrt(4 + x²) around a point. Let's pick x=4 again. Let me expand sqrt(4 + x²) around x=4. Let me set t = x - 4, so x = 4 + t, with t ranging from -1 to 1 (since x is from 3 to 5). Then, f(x) = sqrt(4 + (4 + t)²) = sqrt(4 + 16 + 8t + t²) = sqrt(20 + 8t + t²). Let me expand this using a Taylor series. Let’s denote g(t) = sqrt(20 + 8t + t²). The expansion around t=0 (i.e., x=4) would be:\n\ng(t) ≈ g(0) + g’(0)t + (1/2)g’’(0)t² + ...\n\nFirst, compute g(0) = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.4721\n\ng’(t) = [ (8 + 2t) ] / (2 sqrt(20 + 8t + t²)) = (8 + 2t)/(2 sqrt(20 + 8t + t²)) = (4 + t)/sqrt(20 + 8t + t²)\n\nSo g’(0) = 4 / sqrt(20) = 4 / (2*sqrt(5)) = 2/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.8944\n\ng’’(t) = [ sqrt(20 + 8t + t²)*1 - (4 + t)*( (8 + 2t)/(2 sqrt(20 + 8t + t²)) ) ] / (20 + 8t + t²)\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, use the chain rule. Let me compute the second derivative.\n\ng(t) = (20 + 8t + t²)^(1/2)\n\ng’(t) = (1/2)(20 + 8t + t²)^(-1/2)*(8 + 2t)\n\ng’’(t) = (-1/4)(20 + 8t + t²)^(-3/2)*(8 + 2t)^2 + (1/2)(20 + 8t + t²)^(-1/2)*(2)\n\nAt t=0:\n\ng’’(0) = (-1/4)(20)^(-3/2)*(64) + (1/2)(20)^(-1/2)*(2)\n\n= (-16)/ (20^(3/2)) + (1)/(20^(1/2))\n\n= (-16)/(20*sqrt(20)) + 1/sqrt(20)\n\n= [ -16 + 20 ] / (20*sqrt(20))\n\n= 4 / (20*sqrt(20)) = 1/(5*sqrt(20)) = 1/(10*sqrt(5)) ≈ 0.0447\n\nSo the Taylor expansion up to the second order is:\n\ng(t) ≈ sqrt(20) + (2/sqrt(5)) t + (1/(2*10*sqrt(5))) t² ≈ 4.4721 + 0.8944 t + 0.02236 t²\n\nNow, integrating from t=-1 to t=1 (since x from 3 to 5 is t from -1 to 1):\n\nIntegral ≈ ∫_{-1}^1 [4.4721 + 0.8944 t + 0.02236 t²] dt\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n∫4.4721 dt from -1 to 1 = 4.4721 * (2) = 8.9442\n\n∫0.8944 t dt = 0.8944 * [t²/2] from -1 to 1 = 0.8944 * (0.5 - 0.5) = 0\n\n∫0.02236 t² dt = 0.02236 * [t³/3] from -1 to 1 = 0.02236 * (1/3 - (-1)/3) = 0.02236 * (2/3) ≈ 0.0149\n\nTotal integral ≈ 8.9442 + 0 + 0.0149 ≈ 8.9591\n\nSo this is a better approximation, but since we truncated the Taylor series after the quadratic term, and the remainder term would involve higher-order derivatives. However, since we have a convex function (positive second derivative), the Taylor series up to the second order would be a lower bound if the remainder is positive. Wait, the remainder term for Taylor series in expansion around t=0 is (1/6)g'''(c) t^3 for some c between -1 and 1. However, since the third derivative might be negative or positive, it's not straightforward. This approach might not give a guaranteed bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use inequalities for sqrt(4 + x²). Let's consider that sqrt(4 + x²) can be compared to linear functions. For example, since sqrt(4 + x²) is convex, maybe we can use a combination of linear functions that bound it from below and above.\n\nWait, another approach: using the fact that sqrt(4 + x²) ≥ x for all x, but integrating x from 3 to 5 gives (25/2 - 9/2) = 8, which is much lower than 8.9, so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that sqrt(4 + x²) is equal to x*sqrt(1 + 4/x²). For x ≥ 3, 4/x² ≤ 4/9 ≈ 0.444. So maybe expand sqrt(1 + 4/x²) using a binomial approximation. Let's write:\n\nsqrt(4 + x²) = x*sqrt(1 + (4/x²)) = x*(1 + (2/x²) - (2/x⁴) + ... ) using the expansion sqrt(1 + y) ≈ 1 + y/2 - y²/8 + ... for y small. Here y = 4/x².\n\nSo, sqrt(4 + x²) ≈ x + 2/x - 2/(x³) + ...\n\nIntegrating term by term from 3 to 5:\n\n∫sqrt(4 + x²) dx ≈ ∫(x + 2/x - 2/x³) dx = [x²/2 + 2 ln x + 1/x²] from 3 to 5\n\nCompute at x=5: 25/2 + 2 ln5 + 1/25 ≈ 12.5 + 3.2189 + 0.04 ≈ 15.7589\n\nAt x=3: 9/2 + 2 ln3 + 1/9 ≈ 4.5 + 2.1972 + 0.1111 ≈ 6.8083\n\nIntegral ≈ 15.7589 - 6.8083 ≈ 8.9506\n\nThis gives approximately 8.95, which is above 8.9, but again, this is an approximation. However, since we truncated the series, we need to check whether the next term is positive or negative. The next term in the expansion would be + (3y³)/(16*2!) - ... Wait, the expansion of sqrt(1 + y) is 1 + y/2 - y²/8 + y³/16 - 5y⁴/128 + ... So, the next term after -2/x³ would be + (4/x²)^3 / 16 = (64/x^6)/16 = 4/x^6. Wait, integrating that would give a positive term, but the coefficient alternates signs. So the approximation is alternating. Since we have an alternating series with decreasing terms, the error is bounded by the first omitted term. However, this is getting complicated. The integral approximation using two terms gives around 8.95, but the actual integral is slightly higher because the next term is positive. So this might not give a strict lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps bound the function sqrt(4 + x²) between two linear functions. For example, find a line y = a x + b such that a x + b ≤ sqrt(4 + x²) ≤ c x + d over [3,5]. But how to choose a, b, c, d?\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that for x > 0, sqrt(4 + x²) ≤ x + 2/(2x), which comes from the inequality sqrt(a + b) ≤ sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)/2? Not sure. Wait, actually, the AM-GM inequality might help. Let me recall that sqrt(4 + x²) can be written as sqrt((x)^2 + (2)^2). The integral of sqrt(x² + a²) is known, but that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, another idea: use the fact that for x ≥ 3, sqrt(4 + x²) ≥ x + 2/(x + 1). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, find a lower bound function that is easier to integrate. For example, consider that sqrt(4 + x²) ≥ x + something.\n\nAlternatively, compare with a linear function that matches at two points. Suppose we choose a linear function that coincides with sqrt(4 + x²) at x=3 and x=4. Let's compute f(3)=sqrt(13)≈3.6055, f(4)=sqrt(20)=≈4.4721. The linear function passing through (3, 3.6055) and (4, 4.4721) has slope (4.4721 - 3.6055)/1 = 0.8666. The equation is y = 3.6055 + 0.8666(x - 3). So between x=3 and x=4, this line is below the convex function, and between x=4 and x=5, maybe extend this line and see?\n\nWait, but if we split the integral into two intervals, [3,4] and [4,5], then on each interval, we can use a linear lower bound. For [3,4], use the line from (3, f(3)) to (4, f(4)), and for [4,5], use the line from (4, f(4)) to (5, f(5)). But since the function is convex, those lines would be below the function on each interval, right? Wait, no. For a convex function, the chord lies above the function, so if we use the chord on each subinterval, that would be above the function, but if we use the tangent lines, that would be below. Wait, confusion again. Let me clarify: For a convex function, on any interval [a,b], the function lies below the chord connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). Therefore, integrating the chord gives an upper bound. If we divide the interval into smaller intervals and use chords on each subinterval, this is the trapezoidal rule, which overestimates the integral. To get a lower bound, we can use tangent lines or other methods. Alternatively, use the fact that on each subinterval, the minimum of the function occurs at the left endpoint (since the function is increasing), so maybe use rectangles. Wait, but the function is increasing, so the left endpoint has the minimum value on each subinterval.\n\nIf we use the left Riemann sum, that would give a lower bound. For example, divide [3,5] into n subintervals, each of width Δx, and sum f(x_i) * Δx for i from 0 to n-1. As n increases, the left Riemann sum approaches the integral from below. But with a larger n, it's more work, but maybe for n=2, let's try.\n\nDivide [3,5] into two intervals: [3,4] and [4,5]. Left Riemann sum: f(3)*1 + f(4)*1 ≈ 3.6055 + 4.4721 ≈ 8.0776, which is way below 8.9. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the right Riemann sum: f(4)*1 + f(5)*1 ≈ 4.4721 + 5.3852 ≈ 9.8573, which is above 9. But we need a lower bound. The left Riemann sum is too low, right Riemann sum is too high. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the midpoint Riemann sum with two intervals: f(3.5)*1 + f(4.5)*1. Compute f(3.5) = sqrt(4 + 12.25) = sqrt(16.25) ≈ 4.0311, f(4.5) = sqrt(4 + 20.25) = sqrt(24.25) ≈ 4.9244. Sum ≈ 4.0311 + 4.9244 ≈ 8.9555. This is closer, but still an approximation. But how to turn this into a bound?\n\nAlternatively, use the trapezoidal rule with more intervals. Let's try with four intervals. Each Δx = 0.5.\n\nx = 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0.\n\nTrapezoidal rule formula: (Δx/2)[f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 2f(x3) + f(x4)]\n\nCompute:\n\nf(3.0) ≈ 3.6055\n\nf(3.5) ≈ 4.0311\n\nf(4.0) ≈ 4.4721\n\nf(4.5) ≈ 4.9244\n\nf(5.0) ≈ 5.3852\n\nSum: 3.6055 + 2*(4.0311 + 4.4721 + 4.9244) + 5.3852\n\n= 3.6055 + 2*(13.4276) + 5.3852\n\n= 3.6055 + 26.8552 + 5.3852 ≈ 35.8459\n\nMultiply by Δx/2 = 0.5/2 = 0.25\n\nIntegral ≈ 35.8459 * 0.25 ≈ 8.9615. So trapezoidal rule with four intervals gives ≈8.9615, which is still below the upper bound of 9 but above 8.9. But since the trapezoidal rule overestimates, the actual integral is less than 8.9615. Wait, no: trapezoidal rule for convex functions overestimates, so the actual integral is less than the trapezoidal estimate. Wait, but in the original problem, they need to show that the integral is less than 9, and we saw that even with two intervals, the trapezoidal rule gives ≈8.99, which is less than 9. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, when we did the trapezoidal rule over the entire interval [3,5], we had (f(3) + f(5))/2 * 2 = f(3) + f(5) ≈ 3.6055 + 5.3852 ≈ 8.9907. Which is less than 9. So that is the upper bound. Therefore, the integral is less than 8.9907, which is less than 9. So, that gives us the upper bound of less than 9. But the problem states to show it's less than 9, which is true.\n\nFor the lower bound, we need something greater than 8.9. Earlier, using the midpoint rule with two intervals gave ≈8.9442, which is a lower bound (since for convex functions, midpoint rule underestimates the integral). Wait, no, wait. For convex functions, the midpoint rule actually gives an underestimate. Wait, let me verify. For a convex function, the midpoint rectangle is below the function because the function is above its tangent line at the midpoint. So the area of the rectangle with height f(midpoint) is less than the integral. Therefore, midpoint rule gives a lower bound. So, midpoint rule with two intervals (each of width 1) gives f(3.5)*1 + f(4.5)*1 ≈ 4.0311 + 4.9244 ≈ 8.9555, which is a lower bound. This is already above 8.9, so maybe this is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks to show that the integral is greater than 8.9. If we can show that the midpoint rule with two intervals gives 8.9555, which is greater than 8.9, then since the midpoint rule is a lower bound, the actual integral must be greater than 8.9555, which is greater than 8.9. Therefore, this would establish the lower bound.\n\nBut wait, the midpoint rule with two intervals gives 8.9555, which is a lower bound. So the actual integral is greater than 8.9555, which is greater than 8.9. Hence, the lower bound of 8.9 holds. But to make this rigorous, we need to confirm that the midpoint rule indeed gives a lower bound for the integral of a convex function. \n\nYes, for a convex function, the midpoint rule underestimates the integral. Because the rectangle's height is the function value at the midpoint, and due to convexity, the function lies above its tangent line at the midpoint, hence the area under the function is greater than the area of the rectangle. Therefore, the midpoint rule gives a lower bound.\n\nTherefore, using the midpoint rule with two intervals gives a lower bound of approximately 8.9555, which is greater than 8.9, thus proving that the integral is greater than 8.9. For the upper bound, the trapezoidal rule with the entire interval gives approximately 8.9907, which is less than 9. Therefore, the integral is between 8.9555 and 8.9907, which is within the required bounds of 8.9 and 9.\n\nTherefore, the strategy would be:\n\n- For the lower bound: Use the midpoint rule on two subintervals, which gives a lower bound of approximately 8.9555, which is greater than 8.9.\n\n- For the upper bound: Use the trapezoidal rule on the entire interval, which gives an upper bound of approximately 8.9907, which is less than 9.\n\nHence, 8.9555 < ∫₃⁵ sqrt(4 + x²) dx < 8.9907, which implies 8.9 < ∫₃⁵ sqrt(4 + x²) dx < 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is proven.\n\nBut to present this formally, we need to calculate the exact values symbolically.\n\nCompute the midpoint rule with two intervals:\n\nFirst interval [3,4], midpoint at 3.5: f(3.5) = sqrt(4 + (3.5)^2) = sqrt(4 + 12.25) = sqrt(16.25) = sqrt(65/4) = (√65)/2 ≈ 4.0311.\n\nSecond interval [4,5], midpoint at 4.5: f(4.5) = sqrt(4 + 20.25) = sqrt(24.25) = sqrt(97/4) = (√97)/2 ≈ 4.9244.\n\nThe midpoint approximation is (f(3.5) + f(4.5)) * 1 = (sqrt(65)/2 + sqrt(97)/2) * 1 = (sqrt(65) + sqrt(97))/2.\n\nCalculate this exactly:\n\nsqrt(65) ≈ 8.0623, sqrt(97) ≈ 9.8494, sum ≈ 17.9117, divided by 2 ≈ 8.9559. So approximately 8.956, which is greater than 8.9.\n\nSince the actual integral is greater than this midpoint sum, it is greater than 8.956, hence greater than 8.9.\n\nFor the upper bound, trapezoidal rule over [3,5] is (f(3) + f(5))/2 * 2 = f(3) + f(5) = sqrt(13) + sqrt(29).\n\nCompute this:\n\nsqrt(13) ≈ 3.6055, sqrt(29) ≈ 5.3852, sum ≈ 8.9907, which is less than 9.\n\nTherefore, the integral satisfies:\n\nMidpoint lower bound ≈8.956 < Integral < Trapezoidal upper bound ≈8.9907,\n\nwhich implies 8.9 < Integral < 9.\n\nTherefore, the inequality 8.9 < ∫₃⁵ sqrt(4 + x²) dx <9 is proven.",
