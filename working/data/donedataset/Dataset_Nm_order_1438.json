    "Content": "I'm reading the problems of Stein and Shakarchi's Complex Analysis, Chapter 2 Problem 1 asks to show that $$f(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}z^{2^n}$$ cannot be analytically continued past the unit disk. (Hint: Suppose $\\theta =\\frac{2\\pi p}{2^k}$ for $p,k$ positive integers, let $z=re^{i\\theta}$ and show $\\mid f(z)\\mid\\rightarrow\\infty$ as $r \\rightarrow1$ ). I understand from the hint they want me to \"pepper\" the unit circle with points where the power expansion explodes so that it is dense with poles. I do not understand why they choose such particular points, but I assume that in retrospect it will show that those are the ones that I can show divergence for the easiest and are dense in the unit circle, so plowing ahead: $$\\lim_{r \\rightarrow 1}\\left| \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty r^{2^n}e^{ i2\\pi p 2^{n-k}}\\right| = \\left| \\sum_{n=0}^k e^{ \\frac{i2\\pi p}{2^{k-n}}} + \\sum_{n=k+1}^\\infty e^{ i2\\pi p2^{n-k}} \\right|  $$ Where do I go from here? Is there some oversimplification of these sinusoids that I'm not seeing? Furthermore, once I manage to show this explodes, if I show that these numbers are dense on the unit circle I'm done, right? Any insight is much appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This may be already answered by the OP himself. Here is a short answer any way. First, recall that for any power series $f(z)=\\sum_{n\\geq0}a_nz^n$ with radius of convergence $1$ , a point $p\\in\\mathbb{S}^1$ is called regular (for $f$ ) if  there is an open ball $D(p;r)$ , $r>0$ ,  and an analytic function $g$ on $D(p;r)$ such that $f(z)=g(z)$ on $D(p;r)\\cap D(0;1)$ . Any point in $\\mathbb{S}^1$ which is not regular for $f$ is said to be singular. It is easy to see that the set of regular points of $f$ is open and so the set of singular points of $f$ is closed. Furthermore, it is well known that the set of singular points is non empty (This can proven by contradiction using the properties of the radius of convergence). The following result will be useful: Lemma: If $f(z)=\\sum_na_kz^k$ is a power series with radius of convergence $1$ and $a_k\\geq0$ , then $$\\lim_{r\\rightarrow1-}f(r)=\\sum_ka_k$$ Proof: Since $a_n\\geq0$ , for each $0<r<1$ and $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ $$f_n(r)=\\sum^n_{k=0}a_kr^k\\leq f(r)=\\sum^\\infty_{k=0}a_kr^k\\leq \\sum^\\infty_{k=0}a_k $$ Clearly $f$ is monotone nondecreasing over $(0,1)$ and so, $\\lim_{r\\rightarrow1-}f(r)=\\sup_{0<r<1}f(r)$ exists (as an extended real number). Putting things together, we obtain that $$\n\\lim_{r\\rightarrow1-}f_n(r)=\\sum^n_{k=0}a_n\\leq \\lim_{r\\rightarrow1-}f(r)\\leq\\sum_{k\\geq0}a_k\n$$ Letting $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ gives $\\sum_ka_k=\\lim_{r\\rightarrow1-}f(r)$ . For the OP, $f(z)=\\sum_{n\\geq0}z^{2^n}$ can be expressed as the power series $f(z)=\\sum_ka_kz^k$ where $a_k=1$ if $k=2^n$ form some $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+$ , and $0$ otherwise. Clearly it has radius of convergence $1$ . Thus, $\\lim_{r\\rightarrow1-}f(r)=\\infty$ by the Lemma above. On the other hand, for any $z\\in B(0;1)$ , $f(z^2)=f(z)-z$ from where we obtain (by induction) that $$ f(z^{2^n})=f(z)-\\sum^{n-1}_{j=0}z^{2^j}, \\qquad n\\in\\mathbb{N}$$ Along the line $rz_{k, m}=re^{2\\pi i k2^{-m}}$ , $0<r<1$ ,  we have $$\nf(r^{2^m})=f\\big(re^{2\\pi ik2^{-m}}\\big) - \\sum^{m-1}_{j=0}r^{2^j}e^{2\\pi ik 2^{j-m}}\n$$ The term $p_{m,k}=\\sum^{m-1}_{j=0}r^{2^j}e^{2\\pi ik 2^{j-m}}$ is  bounded by $m+1$ . By the Lemma above, $\\lim_{r\\rightarrow1-}f(r^{2^m})=\\infty$ , we conclude that $\\lim_{r\\rightarrow1-}|f(rz_{m,k})|=\\infty$ . As a consequence, all points in $\\mathcal{D}=\\{z_{k, m}:k\\in\\mathbb{Z},m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$ are singular points of $f$ . Since $\\mathcal{D}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{S}^1$ , it follows that all points in $\\mathbb{S}^1$ are singular for $f$ ; hence, $f$ cannot be analytically extended to any open domain $\\Omega$ that properly contains $D(0;1)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about showing that the function f(z) = sum_{n=0}^infty z^{2^n} can't be analytically continued past the unit disk. The user also mentions the hint provided in the problem, which involves choosing specific points theta = 2πp/(2^k) and showing the function blows up as r approaches 1.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem's setup and the conditions given.\n\n1. The function f(z) is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of z^{2^n}. So that's one assumption: f(z) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty z^{2^n}.\n\n2. The problem states that this function can't be analytically continued past the unit disk. But that's actually the problem statement, not an assumption. So maybe the assumptions are the conditions given to approach the problem, like the hint.\n\n3. The hint mentions taking theta = 2πp/(2^k) where p and k are positive integers. So theta is of that form. That's another assumption: theta = 2πp/(2^k} for positive integers p, k.\n\n4. Then they let z = r e^{i theta} and want to show |f(z)| approaches infinity as r approaches 1. So the approach assumes z is approaching the unit circle along the radius at angle theta. So that's another assumption: z = re^{iθ} with r approaching 1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is trying to follow the hint. So perhaps the assumptions include the conditions given in the hint. So the key conditions here are the specific choice of theta and the form of z as re^{i theta} approaching the unit circle.\n\nBut in the example provided earlier, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, the assumptions would be about the function f(z), the points theta, and the path z approaching the unit circle.\n\nSo let's list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- f(z) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ z^{2^n}\n- θ = (2πp)/(2^k) where p, k are positive integers\n- z = re^{iθ} with r approaching 1\n\nBut the problem statement is to show that f can't be analytically continued past the unit disk, using the hint. So the problem is as stated, but structured with these assumptions.\n\nWait, but maybe the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. The original problem says \"Show that f(z)... can't be analytically continued past the unit disk.\" The user then includes the hint, which gives specific theta values. The problem is structured to use those theta points to demonstrate the blow-up, which would prevent analytic continuation.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The function f(z) is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of z^{2^n}.\n2. θ is chosen as (2πp)/(2^k) for positive integers p and k.\n3. z approaches the unit circle along the radius at angle θ, i.e., z = re^{iθ} with r → 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to show that f cannot be analytically continued past the unit disk, using these assumptions.\n\nBut the example given in the initial instruction had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition on an object. Here, similarly:\n\nAssumption:\n- f(z) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ z^{2^n}\n- θ = (2πp)/(2^k) for some positive integers p and k\n- z = re^{iθ} where r approaches 1 from below\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that f can't be analytically continued past the unit disk. The method involves using those θ points. So the problem statement is the same, but the assumptions are the given conditions needed to approach the problem as per the hint.\n\nSo structured:\n\nAssumption:\n- Function f(z) is defined by the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ z^{2^n} within the unit disk.\n- Consider points θ of the form θ = (2πp)/2^k where p and k are positive integers.\n- z approaches the unit circle along the radius z = re^{iθ} as r → 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(z) cannot be analytically continued past the unit disk.\n\nBut in the original example, the problem was restated concisely. So here, the problem is to prove that f(z) cannot be analytically continued beyond the unit disk, given those assumptions.\n\nWait, but the original problem's assumptions might include more. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's original problem statement includes:\n\nTitle: Show that f(z)=sum_{n=0}^\\infty z^{2^n} can't be analytically continued past the unit disk.\n\nQuestion: ... using the hint, suppose theta = 2πp/(2^k) for p,k positive integers, let z=re^{i theta} and show |f(z)|→infty as r→1.\n\nSo the problem is the title, and the hint gives specific theta values. Therefore, the key assumptions would be:\n\n- The definition of f(z) as the given series.\n- The specific choice of θ as (2πp)/2^k for positive integers p, k.\n- Approaching the boundary along radial lines z = re^{iθ} as r→1.\n\nTherefore, each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- f(z) is defined by f(z) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ z^{2^n} for |z| < 1.\n- θ is of the form θ = (2πp)/2^k where p and k are positive integers.\n- z is approaching the unit circle along z = re^{iθ} as r → 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(z) cannot be analytically continued past the unit disk.\n\nBut the original example's assumption included multiple conditions each applied to one object. For example, in the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, the assumptions are:\n\n1. Function definition.\n2. Theta's form.\n3. Path of z approaching the boundary.\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\n$f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} z^{2^n}$ for $|z| < 1$,\n$\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi p}{2^k}$ where $p$ and $k$ are positive integers,\n$z = re^{i\\theta}$ with $r \\rightarrow 1^{-}$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $f(z)$ cannot be analytically continued past the unit disk.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
