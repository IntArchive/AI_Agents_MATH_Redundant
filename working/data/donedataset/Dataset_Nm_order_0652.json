    "Content": "I have found an interesting family of infinite products. The most interesting one of them being: $\\sqrt{2}-1=\\dfrac{1\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot23\\cdots}{3\\cdot5\\cdot11\\cdot13\\cdot19\\cdot21\\cdots}$ The numerators follow the pattern $+6,+2,+6,+2,\\cdots$ and the denominators follow $+2,+6,+2,+6,\\cdots$ The family of products was derived from assuming: $\\sin(x)-\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}=-\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot\\left(1-\\dfrac{4x}{\\pi}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{4x}{3\\pi}\\right)\\left(1+\\dfrac{4x}{5\\pi}\\right)\\left(1+\\dfrac{4x}{7\\pi}\\right)\n\\cdots$ And subsequently replacing $x$ as $\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$ The keyword here being \"assumed\", so I don't know if this product can be proven. The values do seem to be equal after a few iterations though. However, I would greatly appreciate any proofs or alternate derivations.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You wrote The family of products was derived from assuming: $\\sin(x)-\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}=-\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot\\left(1-\\dfrac{4x}{\\pi}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{4x}{3\\pi}\\right)\\left(1+\\dfrac{4x}{5\\pi}\\right)\\left(1+\\dfrac{4x}{7\\pi}\\right)\n\\cdots$ That assumption is indeed correct. Proof: Using the “sum to product” identity  for the sine  we have $$\nf(x) = \\sin(x) - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} = \\sin(x) - \\sin\\left(\\frac \\pi 4\\right) \n= -2 \\sin\\left(\\frac x2 - \\frac \\pi 8\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac x2 - \\frac {3\\pi}8 \\right) \\, .\n$$ Using the infinite product for the sine (see, e.g., here ), the first factor can be written as $$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac x2 - \\frac \\pi 8\\right)\n= \\left(\\frac x2 - \\frac \\pi 8\\right)\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(1-\\frac{x}{2\\pi n} + \\frac{1}{8n}\\right)\n \\left(1+\\frac{x}{2\\pi n} - \\frac{1}{8n}\\right) \\\\\n= (-\\frac \\pi 8) \\left(1 - \\frac {4x}{\\pi} \\right)\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(1\n + \\frac{1}{8n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{4x}{(8n+1)\\pi} \\right)\n \\left(1- \\frac{1}{8n}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{4x}{(8n-1)\\pi}\\right) \\\\\n= C_1 \\left(1 - \\frac {4x}{\\pi} \\right)\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \n \\left(1+\\frac{4x}{(8n-1)\\pi}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{4x}{(8n+1)\\pi} \\right)\n$$ with the constant $$\n C_1 = (-\\frac \\pi 8)\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \n\\left(1- \\left(\\frac{1}{8n}\\right)^2\\right) \\, .\n$$ In the same way we get for the second factor $$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac x2 - \\frac {3\\pi}8 \\right)  = C_2 \\left(1 - \\frac {4x}{3\\pi} \\right)\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \n\\left(1+\\frac{4x}{(8n-3)\\pi} \\right) \\left(1-\\frac{4x}{(8n+3)\\pi}\\right)\n$$ with some constant $C_2$ . Combining these results we have $$\n f(x) = C \\left(1 - \\frac {4x}{\\pi} \\right)\\left(1 - \\frac {4x}{3\\pi} \\right) \\\\\n\\times \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty\\left(1+\\frac{4x}{(8n-3)\\pi} \\right)\n\\left(1+\\frac{4x}{(8n-1)\\pi} \\right)\\left(1-\\frac{4x}{(8n+1)\\pi} \\right)\\left(1-\\frac{4x}{(8n+3)\\pi} \\right)\n$$ with some constant $C$ . Setting $x=0$ shows that $C= -1/\\sqrt 2$ , and that concludes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user found an infinite product that equals √2 -1. The product is a fraction where the numerator is 1·7·9·15·17·23... and the denominator is 3·5·11·13·19·21... They mention the numerators follow the pattern +6, +2, +6, +2, etc., and denominators follow +2, +6, +2, +6... So let's see: numerators start at 1, then add 6 to get 7, then add 2 to get 9, then add 6 to get 15, add 2 to get 17, add 6 to get 23, etc. Denominators start at 3, add 2 to get 5, add 6 to get 11, add 2 to get 13, add 6 to get 19, add 2 to get 21, etc. \n\nThe user derived this product by assuming a form for sin(x) - 1/√2 as a product involving terms like (1 - 4x/π), (1 - 4x/(3π)), (1 + 4x/(5π)), (1 + 4x/(7π)), etc., then substituting x = π/2. They admit they \"assumed\" this product, so they're not sure if it's valid and want a proof or alternative derivation.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem. \n\nThe main problem is to prove that the infinite product (1·7·9·15·17·23...)/(3·5·11·13·19·21...) equals √2 -1. The assumptions would include the structure of the product, the patterns in numerators and denominators. Also, the user's starting point was an assumed product form for sin(x) -1/√2 with specific factors. But since they want an alternate derivation, maybe the key assumptions are about the product structure and the sequence of numerators and denominators.\n\nWait, the user also replaced x with π/2 in their assumed product equation. So maybe the original assumption is about the product representation of sin(x) -1/√2. But since the problem is to prove the equality of the numerical infinite product to √2 -1, perhaps the main assumptions are the patterns in the numerators and denominators of the product. Alternatively, if the problem is to derive the product from the assumed sine equation, but the user is unsure if that assumption is valid, so perhaps they want a proof that the product equals √2 -1 regardless of the sine function approach.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumption lists the conditions given in the problem. So in the original problem here, the key given is the structure of the infinite product (with the patterns in numerator and denominator terms) and the equation that needs proof.\n\nSo the Assumptions would be:\n\n- The numerator terms follow the pattern starting at 1 and alternately adding 6 and 2.\n- The denominator terms follow the pattern starting at 3 and alternately adding 2 and 6.\n- The infinite product of numerators divided by denominators equals √2 -1.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which are given in the original problem. Here, the user presents the product as an equation they want to prove. The user derived this product by assuming a product form for sin(x) -1/√2 and substituting x=π/2, but they don't know if that's valid. The problem they want to be proved is the equation √2 -1 equals that infinite product.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that equality. The assumptions would be the structure of the infinite product (the numerator and denominator sequences). So each assumption would be one property. So:\n\nAssumption: The numerator sequence starts at 1 and alternates adding 6 and 2.\nAssumption: The denominator sequence starts at 3 and alternates adding 2 and 6.\nAssumption: The infinite product is the ratio of the product of the numerator terms to the product of the denominator terms.\n\nWait, but maybe more precise. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had A(n) defined with 5^n and 6^n terms, and the user included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn this case, the problem is about the infinite product. So the user's problem is: Prove that √2 -1 equals that infinite product with those numerator and denominator sequences. So the assumptions would be the definitions of the numerator and denominator sequences. So each assumption is a separate line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption: The numerator terms are generated starting at 1 and alternately adding 6 and 2.\nAssumption: The denominator terms are generated starting at 3 and alternately adding 2 and 6.\nProblem: Prove that the infinite product (1·7·9·15·17·23⋯)/(3·5·11·13·19·21⋯) equals √2 -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the specific terms. Wait, but in the problem statement, the numerator is 1,7,9,15,17,23,... and denominators are 3,5,11,13,19,21,... So perhaps the exact terms. But the user describes the patterns as +6, +2, etc. So maybe the key assumptions are the starting terms and the addition pattern.\n\nSo each assumption is one line per object. So for the numerator sequence: starting at 1, with increments alternating between +6 and +2. Similarly, denominator starts at 3, increments alternate between +2 and +6. So each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption: The numerator sequence starts at 1 and alternates adding 6 and 2.\nAssumption: The denominator sequence starts at 3 and alternates adding 2 and 6.\nProblem: Prove that √2 -1 equals the infinite product of (numerator terms)/(denominator terms).\n\nBut maybe more precise. Let's check the numerator sequence: 1, 7, 9, 15, 17, 23, 25, etc. Each step: +6, +2, +6, +2, etc. Similarly, denominators: 3,5 (+2), 11 (+6), 13 (+2), 19 (+6), 21 (+2), etc.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are about the sequences' starting points and their step patterns. So each of these is an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption: The numerator sequence starts at 1 and alternates between adding 6 and 2.\nAssumption: The denominator sequence starts at 3 and alternates between adding 2 and 6.\nProblem: Prove that the infinite product $$\\sqrt{2}-1 = \\frac{1 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 23 \\cdots}{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 21 \\cdots}$$ holds.\n\nI think that's correct. The problem is to prove the equality of the infinite product (as defined by those sequences) to √2 -1. The assumptions are the definitions of the sequences.",
