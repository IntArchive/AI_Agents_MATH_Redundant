    "Content": "I came across one problem in a finite field as follows: Let $F$ be a finite field. Show that if $a, b\\in F$ both are non-squares, then $ab$ is a square. I wanted to prove it by using the idea of Biquadratic field extension. But there is no biquadratic extension over finite fields. Please, any hints for proving above fact? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If the characteristic of $F$ is $2$, then $x\\mapsto x^2$ is an automorphism of $F$ and therefore every element is a square. So we can assume the characteristic is an odd prime. Consider the multiplicative group $F^*$ of nonzero elements; the map $x\\mapsto x^2$ is a group endomorphism of $F^*$ with kernel $\\{1,-1\\}$. Therefore the image $H$ of this map is a subgroup satisfying $|H|=|F^*|/2$; this amounts to saying that $H$, which is the set of all squares in $F^*$, has index $2$. Therefore $F^*/H$ is a two-element group and the statement follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is about finite fields: if two elements a and b are both non-squares in a finite field F, then their product ab should be a square. Hmm. I need to recall some properties of finite fields.\n\nFirst, I remember that the multiplicative group of a finite field is cyclic. That's a key point. So, if F is a finite field, then F* (the multiplicative group) is cyclic of order q-1, where q is the order of the field. Since it's cyclic, every element can be written as some power of a generator, say g. \n\nIn a cyclic group of order n, the squares are exactly the elements that can be written as g^(2k) for some integer k. So, if the order of the group is even, then the squares form a subgroup of index 2. Wait, but in finite fields, the multiplicative group has order q-1. Depending on whether q-1 is even or not, the number of squares would change. But since q is a prime power, if the characteristic is not 2, then q is odd, so q-1 is even, so there are (q-1)/2 squares and the same number of non-squares. If the characteristic is 2, then every element is a square because the Frobenius endomorphism x → x² is surjective in characteristic 2. Wait, but in that case, the original problem might be trivial because if the field has characteristic 2, then all elements are squares, so there are no non-squares. Therefore, maybe the field is of odd characteristic. The problem didn't specify, but maybe we can assume that the field has odd characteristic.\n\nWait, the problem just says a finite field. So perhaps we need to consider both cases. But if the field has characteristic 2, then every element is a square, so the statement would be vacuously true because there are no non-squares. So the problem is probably about finite fields of odd characteristic.\n\nSo assuming that the field has odd characteristic, then the multiplicative group F* has even order q-1. Then the squares form a subgroup of index 2. So the non-squares are the elements not in this subgroup. So if a and b are non-squares, then in terms of the generator g, we can write a = g^(2k+1), b = g^(2m+1). Then their product ab = g^(2k+1 + 2m+1) = g^(2(k + m + 1)). Which is a square. Therefore, the product of two non-squares is a square. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut the original question mentions using biquadratic extensions, but the user was stuck because there are no biquadratic extensions over finite fields. Maybe they were overcomplicating it. The multiplicative group approach seems much simpler.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the Legendre symbol in finite fields. In the multiplicative group, the quadratic character (whether something is a square) can be represented by a homomorphism χ: F* → {1, -1}, where χ(a) = 1 if a is a square, -1 otherwise. Then χ(ab) = χ(a)χ(b). If both a and b are non-squares, then χ(a) = χ(b) = -1, so χ(ab) = 1, meaning ab is a square. That's another way to see it.\n\nSo the key idea is that the quadratic residues form a subgroup of index 2 in the multiplicative group, and the product of two non-residues is a residue. This is similar to the result in number theory where the product of two quadratic non-residues modulo a prime is a quadratic residue.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved by using properties of the multiplicative group or the quadratic character homomorphism. The user might not have realized that the multiplicative group is cyclic, which makes the problem straightforward. The mention of biquadratic extensions might be a red herring here.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be that F is a finite field, and a, b are elements of F that are both non-squares. Then the problem is to show that ab is a square.",
