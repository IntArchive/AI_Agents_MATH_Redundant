    "Content": "Last month I was calculating $\\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\, dx$ when I stumbled on the surprising identity: $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n\\left(\\frac{1}{4n+1} +\\frac{1}{4n+3}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt8}$$ and I knew $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{8}$$ So if I could find a proof that $$\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n\\left(\\frac{1}{4n+1} +\\frac{1}{4n+3}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2}$$ then this could be a new proof that $\\zeta(2)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$. I've thought over this for almost a month and I'm no closer on showing this identity. Note: Article on the multiplication of conditionally convergent series: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2369519",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a_k = (-1)^k \\left(\\frac{1}{4k+1} + \\frac{1}{4k+3}\\right)$ and $b_k = \\frac{1}{(4k+1)^2} + \\frac{1}{(4k+3)^2}$. The goal is to show that: $$ \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i\\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty b_i $$\nThe key observation that I missed on my previous attempt is that: $$ \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i = \\sum_{i=-n-1}^n \\frac{(-1)^i}{4i+1} $$ This transformation allows me to then mimic the proof that was suggested in the comments by @user17762.\n\\begin{align*}  \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\\right)^2 - \\sum_{i=0}^n b_i \n&= \\left(\\sum_{i=-n-1}^n \\frac{(-1)^i}{4i+1}\\right)^2 - \\sum_{i=-n-1}^n \\frac{1}{(4i+1)^2}   \\\\\n&= \\sum_{\\substack{i,j=-n-1 \\\\ i \\neq j}}^n \\frac{(-1)^i}{4i+1}\\frac{(-1)^j}{4j+1} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{\\substack{i,j=-n-1 \\\\ i \\neq j}}^n \\frac{(-1)^{i+j}}{4j-4i}\\left(\\frac{1}{4i+1}-\\frac{1}{4j+1} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{\\substack{i,j=-n-1 \\\\ i \\neq j}}^n \\frac{(-1)^{i+j}}{2j-2i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4i+1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=-n-1}^n \\frac{(-1)^i}{4i+1} \\sum_{\\substack{j=-n-1 \\\\ i \\neq j}}^n \\frac{(-1)^j}{j-i} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=-n-1}^n \\frac{(-1)^i }{4i+1}c_{i,n} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i \\,c_{i,n}\n\\end{align*}\nWhere the last equality follows from $c_{i,n} = c_{-i-1, n}$. Since $c_{i,n}$ is a partial alternating harmonic sum, it is bounded by its largest entry in the sum: $\\left| c_{i,n} \\right| \\le \\frac{1}{n-i+1}$. We also know that $\\left|a_i\\right| \\le \\frac{2}{4i+1}$. Apply these two inequalities to get:\n\\begin{align*}\\left| \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\\right)^2 - \\sum_{i=0}^n b_i \\right| &\\le \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=0}^n \\frac{2}{4i+1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n-i+1} \\\\ &\\le \\sum_{i=0}^n \\frac{1}{4n+5}\\left( \\frac{4}{4i+1} + \\frac{1}{n-i+1} \\right) \\\\ &\\le \\frac{1}{4n+5}\\left( 5 + \\ln(4n+1) +\\ln(n+1)\\right) \\\\\n& \\to 0 ~\\text{ as }~ n \\to \\infty\n\\end{align*}\nThis concludes the proof.  In fact, with the same idea, you can prove this general family of identities: Fix an integer $m \\ge 3$, then: \\begin{align*} & \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{m-1} - \\frac{1}{m+1} - \\frac{1}{2m-1} + \\frac{1}{2m+1} + \\frac{1}{3m-1} - \\cdots \\right)^2  \\\\\n=& ~ \\left(\\sum_{i=-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^i}{im+1}\\right)^2 \\\\ \n=& ~ \\sum_{i=-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(im+1)^2} \\\\\n=& ~ 1 +  \\frac{1}{(m-1)^2} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} + \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} + \\frac{1}{(2m+1)^2} + \\frac{1}{(3m-1)^2} + \\cdots \\\\\n=& ~ \\left(\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{m}}{\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{m}}\\right)^2 \\end{align*}\nThe last equality follows from the comment by @Lucian.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange: The title is about showing that the square of a certain series equals another series. The user mentions calculating an integral involving 1/(1+x⁴) and discovered an identity involving an alternating series of terms 1/(4n+1) + 1/(4n+3), which sums to π/√8. They also note that the sum of 1/(2n+1)² is π²/8. The goal is to prove that the square of the first series equals the second series, which would lead to a new proof that ζ(2)=π²/6.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the problem is about series. The key assumptions here would relate to the conditions under which the series converge and any properties they have. However, the problem as stated doesn't list explicit assumptions beyond the series definitions. The user mentions that the series is conditionally convergent, referencing an article on multiplying conditionally convergent series. So, the assumptions might include that the series is conditionally convergent, which affects how they can be multiplied.\n\nWait, the problem statement in the example included only the necessary assumptions from the original problem. The original problem here is to square one series and show it equals another. The assumptions would include the definitions of the series. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nThe series to be squared is the alternating series: sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n (1/(4n+1) + 1/(4n+3)). The squared result is supposed to equal sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/(2n+1)^2. The problem is about proving this equality. So, the key assumption here is the definition of each series. Since the series being squared is an alternating series, another assumption could be about its convergence. However, the user's note mentions conditional convergence, so that's an important point. Also, the series on the right is the sum of reciprocals of squares of odd integers, which is absolutely convergent.\n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n\n1. The series S = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n (1/(4n+1) + 1/(4n+3)) is conditionally convergent.\n2. The series T = sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/(2n+1)^2 is absolutely convergent.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variables involved. Here, the problem is about the equality of two series after squaring one. The user wants the assumptions to list properties or conditions applied to one object each. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: The series S = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n (1/(4n+1) + 1/(4n+3)) converges conditionally.\n\nAssumption: The series T = sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/(2n+1)^2 converges absolutely.\n\nBut the problem statement is to show that S squared equals T. The example's assumptions were about the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, maybe the assumptions are about the convergence of the series, which is necessary for manipulating them (since multiplying conditionally convergent series can be tricky). So listing the convergence properties as separate assumptions makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is purely algebraic without considering convergence, but the user's note refers to conditional convergence, so the convergence is important here. Hence, including the convergence conditions as assumptions would be appropriate.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption: The series S = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n (1/(4n+1) + 1/(4n+3)) converges conditionally.\n\nAssumption: The series T = ∑_{n=0}^∞ 1/(2n+1)^2 converges absolutely.\n\nProblem: Show that S² = T.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is the statement to be proven, so the problem is exactly that. The assumptions are the convergence conditions needed for the operations (squaring the series) to be valid. The user also mentions that multiplying conditionally convergent series can be problematic, hence the note. So those convergence properties are critical assumptions here.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those two convergence assumptions and then state the problem of showing S squared equals T.",
