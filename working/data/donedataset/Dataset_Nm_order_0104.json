    "Content": "I've come across a paper that mentions the fact that matrices commute if and only if they share a common basis of eigenvectors. Where can I find a proof of this statement?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are $n\\times n$ matrices, with complex entries say, that commute. Then we decompose $\\mathbb C^n$ as a direct sum of eigenspaces of $A$, say\n$\\mathbb C^n = E_{\\lambda_1} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus E_{\\lambda_m}$, where $\\lambda_1,\\ldots, \\lambda_m$ are the eigenvalues of $A$, and $E_{\\lambda_i}$ is the eigenspace for $\\lambda_i$.\n(Here $m \\leq n$, but some eigenspaces could be of dimension bigger than one, so we need not have $m = n$.) Now one sees that since $B$ commutes with $A$, $B$ preserves each of the $E_{\\lambda_i}$:\nIf $A v = \\lambda_i v, $ then $A (B v) = (AB)v = (BA)v = B(Av) = B(\\lambda_i v) = \\lambda_i Bv.$ Now we consider $B$ restricted to each $E_{\\lambda_i}$ separately, and decompose\neach $E_{\\lambda_i}$ into a sum of eigenspaces for $B$.   Putting all these decompositions together, we get a decomposition of $\\mathbb C^n$ into a direct sum of spaces, each of which is a simultaneous eigenspace for $A$ and $B$. NB: I am cheating here, in that $A$ and $B$ may not be diagonalizable (and then the statement of your question is not literally true), but in this case, if you replace \"eigenspace\" by \"generalized eigenspace\", the above argument goes through just as well.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking about a statement they found in a paper: matrices commute if and only if they share a common basis of eigenvectors. They want a proof of this. Hmm, first I need to recall linear algebra concepts. \n\nFirst, I remember that if two matrices commute, meaning AB = BA, then there might be some relationship between their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. But is it true that commuting matrices necessarily share a common eigenbasis? Conversely, if two matrices share a common eigenbasis, they should commute because they can be simultaneously diagonalized. \n\nWait, but the statement says \"if and only if,\" so both directions need to hold. Let me think. If two matrices are diagonalizable and they commute, then they can be simultaneously diagonalized, which implies they share a common basis of eigenvectors. However, not all matrices are diagonalizable. So does the original statement assume that the matrices are diagonalizable? Because if they aren't, then even if they commute, they might not share a common eigenbasis. \n\nFor example, consider two commuting matrices that are not diagonalizable. They might still share some eigenvectors, but not a full basis. So maybe the original statement has an implicit assumption that the matrices are diagonalizable. Alternatively, maybe the paper was referring to normal matrices, which are diagonalizable over the complex numbers. \n\nThe user's original question doesn't mention any specific conditions, so perhaps the answer requires that the matrices are diagonalizable. Therefore, the assumption should include that both matrices are diagonalizable. Otherwise, the \"only if\" part might not hold. \n\nSo, structuring the problem based on this, the key assumptions would be that the matrices are diagonalizable and that they commute. The problem would then be to prove that they share a common eigenbasis if and only if they commute. But wait, the converse is straightforward: if they share a common eigenbasis, then they are simultaneously diagonalizable, hence their product in either order would be the same. \n\nBut to make the \"if and only if\" accurate, the matrices need to be diagonalizable. So the assumptions should include that both matrices are diagonalizable. Otherwise, the statement isn't generally true. Therefore, the formatted problem should include that assumption.\n\nSo the Assumptions would be:\n- Both matrices are diagonalizable.\n- Both matrices commute with each other.\n\nWait, but the original problem is stated as \"matrices commute if and only if they share a common basis of eigenvectors.\" The user's question doesn't mention diagonalizability. So perhaps the correct assumptions are that the matrices are diagonalizable. Because if they are not, even if they commute, they might not have a common eigenbasis. \n\nTherefore, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should include that the matrices are diagonalizable. Otherwise, the \"only if\" direction may not hold. So the user's problem as stated might be missing that key condition. Hence, when structuring the problem, the assumption should clarify that the matrices are diagonalizable. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should include assumptions about diagonalizability. So:\n\nAssumption:\nBoth matrices are square matrices of the same size,\nBoth matrices are diagonalizable,\nThe matrices commute with each other.\n\nWait, but the problem is an \"if and only if\" statement. So maybe the assumptions need to be split. For the \"if\" direction: if they share a common eigenbasis, then they commute. For the \"only if\" direction: if they commute and are diagonalizable, then they share a common eigenbasis. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct assumptions are that for the \"only if\" direction, the matrices need to be diagonalizable, while the \"if\" direction doesn't require that. But the original statement is a biconditional, so to have both directions hold, the matrices need to be diagonalizable. \n\nTherefore, the problem's correct assumptions would include that both matrices are diagonalizable. So the formatted problem's assumptions would list that each matrix is diagonalizable. Then the problem is to prove the equivalence under those conditions.",
