    "Content": "I aim to show that $\\int_{(0,1]} 1/x = \\infty$.  My original idea was to find a sequence of simple functions $\\{ \\phi_n \\}$ s.t $\\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\int \\phi_n = \\infty$.  Here is a failed attempt at finding such a sequence of $\\phi_n$: (1) Let $A_k = \\{x \\in (0,1] : 1/x \\ge k  \\}$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. (2) Let $\\phi_n = n \\cdot \\chi_{A_n}$ (3) $\\int \\phi_n = n \\cdot m(A_n) = n \\cdot 1/n = 1$ Any advice from here on this approach or another?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Write $I_k:=((k+1)^{-1},k^{—1})$. Then for each $n$, \n$s_n:=\\sum_{k=1}^nk\\chi_{I_k}$ is a simple non-negative function, and $0\\leq s_n\\leq f(x):=1/x$. We have \n$$\\int_{(0,1]}s_n \\, d\\lambda=\\sum_{k=1}^nk\\left(\\frac 1k-\\frac 1{k+1}\\right)=\\sum_{k=1}^nk\\frac{k+1-k}{k(k+1)}=\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac 1{k+1}.$$\nSo \n$$\\int_{(0,1]}s_{2n} \\, d\\lambda-\\int_{(0,1]}s_n \\, d\\lambda=\\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n}\\frac 1{k+1}\\geq\\frac n{2n+1}\\geq \\frac 13.$$\nAs the sequence $\\{\\int_{(0,1]}s_n \\, d\\lambda\\}$ is increasing, it has a limit. This one can't be finite by the last inequality, and the sequence is non-negative, so it converges to $+\\infty$. This proves that $$\\sup\\{\\int_{(0,1]}s \\, d\\lambda,0\\leq s\\leq f, s\\text{ simple}\\}$$ is infinite, that is, $f$ is not Lebesgue integrable.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the integral of 1/x over (0,1] is infinite, which means the function isn't Lebesgue integrable there. Their approach involved constructing a sequence of simple functions ϕ_n where the integral tends to infinity. Let me parse their steps.\n\nThey defined A_k as the set where 1/x ≥ k. Since x is in (0,1], 1/x ≥ k translates to x ≤ 1/k. So A_k is the interval (0, 1/k]. Then they set ϕ_n = n * χ_{A_n}, which would be n on (0, 1/n] and 0 elsewhere. The integral of ϕ_n is n times the measure of A_n, which is n*(1/n) = 1. So each integral is 1, and the limit is 1, not infinity. That's why it's failing.\n\nSo the problem here is that their choice of ϕ_n isn't working because it's not increasing sufficiently. To fix this, they might need a different sequence. For example, instead of taking ϕ_n = n on (0,1/n], maybe take a sequence that increases more slowly but covers more of the interval. Alternatively, use a different approach like comparing the integral to a divergent series. The key is that for Lebesgue integrability, if the integral of |f| is finite, then f is integrable. Here, we need to show the integral is infinite.\n\nAnother standard approach is to use the monotone convergence theorem. Since 1/x is positive, we can approximate it from below with simple functions. If the integrals of these simple functions go to infinity, then by the theorem, the integral of 1/x must be infinite. For example, partitioning the interval into (1/(n+1), 1/n] and summing the integrals over each partition. Each partition's integral is approximately 1, and summing over n gives a divergent series. But the user's current method isn't capturing that because their ϕ_n is only capturing the very left part each time with height n but small measure.\n\nSo to restructure the problem, the assumptions would include the function 1/x defined on (0,1], using Lebesgue measure, and considering the Lebesgue integral. The problem is to show that the integral is infinite, hence the function isn't Lebesgue integrable. The user's attempt used specific A_k and ϕ_n, but the key assumptions are about the function, the domain, and the type of integral considered.",
