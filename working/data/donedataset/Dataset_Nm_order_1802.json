    "Content": "Let $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ be the roots of $x^n+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^{n-k}a_{n-k}x^k=0$ , so $a_n=(-1)^nx_1\\dots x_n$ . The minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{x_1}+\\dots+\\sqrt{x_n}$ is $$P_nQ_n=f_n^2-a_n\\,g_n^2$$ where $$P_n=\\prod_{\\substack{\\mu_1,\\dots,\\mu_n\\in\\{\\pm1\\}\\\\\\mu_1\\dots\\mu_n=1}}(x-(\\mu_1\\sqrt{x_1}+\\dots+\\mu_n\\sqrt{x_n}))\\\\\nQ_n=\\prod_{\\substack{\\mu_1,\\dots,\\mu_n\\in\\{\\pm1\\}\\\\\\mu_1\\dots\\mu_n=-1}}(x-(\\mu_1\\sqrt{x_1}+\\dots+\\mu_n\\sqrt{x_n}))$$ and $$f_n=\\frac{P_n+Q_n}2\\\\\ng_n=\\frac{Q_n-P_n}{2\\sqrt{x_1\\dots x_n}}$$ Note that the leading term of $P_n,Q_n$ are $x^{2^{n-1}}$ , so the leading term of $f_n$ is $x^{2^{n-1}}$ . This answer proved the leading term of $g_n$ is $2^{n-1}(n-1)!x^{2^{n-1}-n}$ . Note that $P_n,Q_n$ are swapped under each automorphism $\\phi_i:\\sqrt{x_i}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{x_i}$ , so $f_n,g_n$ are unchanged under each automorphism $\\phi_i:\\sqrt{x_i}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{x_i}$ , so $f_n,g_n$ contain no square roots, so $f_n,g_n$ are symmetric polynomials in $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ , so they can be expressed as polynomials in elementary symmetric polynomials $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ . Consider the difference of $f_n$ with the minimal polynomial for $n-1$ : $$\\tag1\\label1\nf_n-(f_n|_{a_n=0})\n$$ For $n=2,3$ , $\\eqref{1}=0$ . My question is: How to prove the following? For $n\\ge4$ , $\\eqref{1}=O(x^{2^{n-1}-2n})$ and the leading coefficient is divisible by $64$ . For $n=4$ , $\\eqref{1}=64$ For $n=5$ , $\\eqref{1}=10240a_5x^6+\\ldots$ For $n=6$ , $\\eqref{1}=1712128a_6x^{20}+\\ldots$ For $n=7$ , $\\eqref{1}=345899008a_7x^{50}+\\ldots$ For $n=8$ , $\\eqref{1}=86249439232a_8x^{112}+\\ldots$ For $n=9$ , $\\eqref{1}=26408252342272a_9x^{238}+\\ldots$ This answer proved a special case $a_1=\\dots=a_{n-1}=0,a_n=-(-1)^n$ of this problem, so the $n$ roots of $x^n-1=0$ are $x_k = \\exp(k  \\frac{2 \\pi i}{n})$ , so we take $\\sqrt{x_k}= \\exp(k  \\frac{\\pi i}{n})$ and $f_n|_{a_n=0}=x^{2^{n-1}}$ . Some thoughts: \\eqref{1} is divisible by $a_n$ . Since $P_n$ and $Q_n$ are homogeneous of total degree $2^{n-1}$ in ( $n+1$ ) variables $x,\\sqrt{x_1},\\dots,\\sqrt{x_n}$ , then $f_n$ and $g_n$ are homogeneous of total degree $2^{n-1}$ in ( $n+1$ ) variables $x,\\sqrt{x_1},\\dots,\\sqrt{x_n}$ , then \\eqref{1} is homogeneous of total degree $2^{n-1}$ in ( $n+1$ ) variables $x,\\sqrt{x_1},\\dots,\\sqrt{x_n}$ . The total degree of $a_n=(\\sqrt{x_1})^2\\dots(\\sqrt{x_n})^2$ in ( $n+1$ ) variables $x,\\sqrt{x_1},\\dots,\\sqrt{x_n}$ is $2n$ . But \\eqref{1} is divisible by $a_n$ , so the total degree of $\\frac{\\eqref{1}}{a_n}$ in ( $n+1$ ) variables $x,\\sqrt{x_1},\\dots,\\sqrt{x_n}$ is $2^{n-1}-2n$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is how i understand the question and the framework. Let $n\\ge 2$ be a fixed natural number. We consider the polynomial ring $R$ over $\\Bbb Q$ generated by transcendental variables $y_1,y_2,\\dots,y_n$ ,\nits field of fractions $L$ , and the subfield $K$ of $L$ generated by $y_1^2,y_2^2,\\dots,y_n^2$ : $$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR &= \\Bbb Q[y_1,y_2,\\dots,y_n]\\ ,\\\\\nK &= \\Bbb Q(y_1^2,y_2^2,\\dots,y_n^2)\\ ,\\\\\nL &= \\Bbb Q(y_1,y_2,\\dots,y_n)\\ . \n\\end{aligned}\n$$ Let $L[X]$ be the polynomial ring over $L$ in the transcendental variable $X$ . The extension $L:K$ is algebraic, of degree $2^n$ , in a tower of quadratic extensions of degree two,\nand the Galois group $G$ is generated by the morphisms $(\\psi_j)_{1\\le j\\le n}$ . Here, $\\psi_j$ sends $y_j$ to $-y_j$ and invariates all other generators of $L$ . (Think of $y_j$ as $\\sqrt{x_j}$ in OP terminology.) We consider the index set $J=\\{+1,-1\\}^n$ of all $n$ -tuples $\\mu$ with entries in the set of signs $\\{+1,-1\\}$ . Each $\\mu\\in J$ has a product\nof the components, $\\Pi\\mu$ , and we define $$\n\\begin{aligned}\nJ(P) &= \\{\\ \\mu\\in J\\ :\\ \\Pi \\mu=+1\\ \\}\\ ,\\\\\nJ(Q) &= \\{\\ \\mu\\in J\\ :\\ \\Pi \\mu=-1\\ \\}\\ ,\\\\[2mm]\nP &= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(P)}(X-\\mu\\cdot y)\\ ,\\qquad\\text{ where }\n\\mu\\cdot y:=\\mu_1y_1+\\mu_2y_2+\\dots+\\mu_ny_n\\ ,\\\\\nQ &= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(Q)}(X-\\mu\\cdot y)\\ ,\\\\\nf &=\\frac 12(P+Q)\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ The sets $J(P), J(Q)$ have each the cardinality $$d:=2^n/2\\ ,$$ so $P,Q,f$ have degree $d$ . The given definition of $P,Q$ make them invariant under the Galois group $G$ .\nThe symmetric group $S=S(n)$ of substitutions / permutations of the generators also acts. So as mentioned, the coefficients of the $X$ -powers in $P,Q,f$ are invariated by $S$ , so they are polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials in the $y$ -variables. The standard notation for these elementary symmetric polynomials is $e_1,e_2,\\dots, e_n$ , so i will also use this notation. We write $E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_n$ for $e_1,e_2,\\dots,e_n$ computed in the squares $y_1^2,y_2^2,\\dots,y_n^2$ . By abuse of notation, we also allow $E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_n$ to be independent variables, potentially with no relation to the symmetric functions. So there are \"universal polynomials\" $U(P),U(Q), U(f)$ in the variables $X,E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_n$ with: $$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP &= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(P)}(X-\\mu\\cdot y)=U(P)(X;E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_n)\\ ,\\\\\nQ &= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(P)}(X-\\mu\\cdot y)=U(Q)(X;E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_n)\\ ,\\\\\nf &= \\frac 12(P+Q)=U(f)(X;E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_n)\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ In the question the following polynomial $F$ is considered, and recall that by abuse we use now $E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_n$ as independent variables with no connection to the initial $y$ -variables: $$\nF:=\nU(f)(X;E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_{n-1},E_n) -U(f)(X;E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_{n-1},0) \\ .\n$$ We have to prove: Claim: The $X$ -degree of $F$ is $d-2n$ , its $X$ -coefficient in this degree is $$cE_n\\ ,\\qquad c \\in \\Bbb Z\\ $$ and $c$ is a number divisible by $64$ . Proof of the claim: We first look which are the changes in $P,Q,f$ when we replace $X$ by $-X$ . There are two cases, $n$ even, and $n$ odd. In each case we use the substitution $\\nu=-\\mu$ , where the minus sign is propagated to each component.\nSo we have $\\Pi\\nu=(-1)^n\\Pi\\mu$ . In the even case $\\mu,\\nu$ belong to the same component $J(P)$ or $J(Q)$ , in the odd case they are in different components. So we compute: $$\n\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\n&n\\text{ even:} &\nP(-X) &\n= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(P)}(-X-\\mu\\cdot y)\n= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(P)}(X+\\mu\\cdot y)\n= \\prod_{\\nu\\in J(P)}(X-\\nu\\cdot y) =P(X)\\ ,\\\\\n&&\nQ(-X) &\n= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(Q)}(-X-\\mu\\cdot y)\n= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(Q)}(X+\\mu\\cdot y)\n= \\prod_{\\nu\\in J(Q)}(X-\\nu\\cdot y) =Q(X)\\ ,\\\\[2mm]\n&n\\text{ odd:} &\nP(-X) &\n= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(P)}(-X-\\mu\\cdot y)\n= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(P)}(X+\\mu\\cdot y)\n= \\prod_{\\nu\\in J(Q)}(X-\\nu\\cdot y) =Q(X)\\ ,\\\\\n&&\nQ(-X) &\n= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(Q)}(-X-\\mu\\cdot y)\n= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(Q)}(X+\\mu\\cdot y)\n= \\prod_{\\nu\\in J(P)}(X-\\nu\\cdot y) =P(X)\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ So in both cases $f=\\frac 12(P+Q)$ satisfies $f(X)=f(-X)$ , so it lives only\nin even $X$ -degrees. $F$ collects from $U(f)$ exactly the monomials that contain $E_n$ to the power at least one. For instance monomials like $E_n$ , $E_1E_2^2E_n^3$ , $E_1^{100}E_2E_3^{27}E_n^4$ may survive. Seen as polynomial in the $y$ -variables we use the weight $2j$ for $E_j$ . For $X$ we use the weight one. With this weight system, $U(P),U(Q),U(f), F$ have total weight $d=2^n/2$ .\nThe maximal $X$ -degree where $E_n$ is present is $d-2n$ , and the corresponding monomial is $$ c\\; E_nX^{d-2n}\\ .$$ This shows the wanted relation $F\\in O(X^{d-2n})$ . It remains to show the wanted divisibility property for $c$ , which is in fact the main problem. The key observation is that if we consider the $E$ -variables $E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_n$ with no relation to the $y$ -variables, then the term $cE_nX^{d-2n}$ is also present in the specialization with zero of the $E$ -variables, all but the last one: $$\nU(f)(X;0,0,\\dots,0,E_n)=X^d+c\\;E_n X^{d-2n}+\\text{(lower terms in degrees $<d-2n$) .}$$ When we also specialize $E_n=0$ and subtract we obtain $$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF(X;0,0,\\dots,0,E_n)\n&=U(f)(X;0,0,\\dots,0,E_n)-\nU(f)(X;0,0,\\dots,0,0)\n\\\\\n&=c\\;E_n X^{d-2n}+\\text{(lower terms in degrees $<d-2n$) .}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ So we need the term in $X$ -degree $d-2n$ from $U(f)(X;0,0,\\dots,0,E_n)$ . And it is enough to further specialize $E_n$ to a value like $\\pm 1$ to isolate $c$ . So we compute the simpler expression, which is an $X$ -polynomial: $$F(X;0,0,\\dots,0,\\pm 1)\\ .$$ For this we may specialize the initial values of $y_1,y_2,\\dots,y_n$ so that the squares $y_1^2,y_2^2,\\dots,y_n^2$ are the complete set of\nthe roots of unity of order $n$ . (This leads to the computation of $F(X;0,0,\\dots,0,\\pm 1)$ .) So we are exactly in the setting of the related question: MSE 5019227 More exactly, let $z_1,z_2,\\dots,z_n=-1$ in cyclic order be the first $n$ roots of the one of order $2n$ . Here $z_j=\\exp(2\\pi ij/(2n))$ . These are the notations used in my answer to MSE 5019227. We specialize these values in the present setting. When plugging in this system, we formally write $z$ for the system $z=(z_1,z_2,\\dots,z_n)$ , and $z^2$ for the system $(z_1^2,z_2^2,\\dots,z_n^2)$ .\nWith these notations observe that: $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 &= e_1(z^2) = E_1(z)\\ ,\\\\\n0 &= e_2(z^2) = E_2(z)\\ ,\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\n0 &= e_{n-1}(z^2)=E_{n-1}(z)\\ ,\\\\\n\\pm1 &= e_n(z^2) = E_n(z)\\ ,\\\\\nP(X,z) &= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(P)}(X-\\mu\\cdot z)\n\\\\\n&=U(P)(X;E_1(z),E_2(z),\\dots,E_{n-1}(z),E_n(z))\n\\\\\n&=U(P)(X;0,0,\\dots,0,\\pm 1)\n\\ ,\\\\\nQ(X,z) &= \\prod_{\\mu\\in J(Q)}(X-\\mu\\cdot z)\n\\\\\n&=U(Q)(X;E_1(z),E_2(z),\\dots,E_{n-1}(z),E_n(z))\n\\\\\n&=U(Q)(X;0,0,\\dots,0,\\pm 1)\n\\ ,\\\\\nf(X,z)\n&=\\frac 12(P(X,z)+Q(X,z))\n\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ In my answer to MSE 5019227 , the above polynomial was explained, it is a polynomial of the shape $$\nX^d + cX^{d-2n}+\\text{(lower terms)}\\ ,$$ and $c$ (from there, which is $\\pm c$ from here) satisfies a refined divisibility condition w.r.t. powers of $2$ . $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nLooking at the original question, there are several components. The user defines variables like x1 to xn as roots of a certain polynomial. They mention minimal polynomials Pn and Qn, which are products over combinations of ±1 for the square roots of the xi's. Then they define fn and gn in terms of Pn and Qn. The problem involves proving two things about the difference between fn and fn with a_n set to zero: that this difference is O(x^{2^{n-1} - 2n}) and that the leading coefficient is divisible by 64 for n ≥4. The user provides examples for n=4 to n=9.\n\nSo first, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. x1, x2, ..., xn are roots of the polynomial x^n + sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-k} a_{n-k} x^k = 0. So the polynomial has coefficients alternating signs, and a_n is (-1)^n times the product of the roots (from Vieta's formula).\n\n2. The minimal polynomial of sqrt(x1) + ... + sqrt(xn) is given as Pn * Qn = fn² - a_n * gn². Here, Pn and Qn are products over sign combinations with product 1 and -1 respectively.\n\n3. Pn and Qn have leading term x^{2^{n-1}}.\n\n4. The leading term of gn is 2^{n-1}(n-1)! x^{2^{n-1} - n} as proven in another answer.\n\n5. Pn and Qn are swapped under each automorphism phi_i that negates sqrt(xi), so fn and gn are invariant under these automorphisms, implying they are symmetric in the roots and thus can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials a1,...,an.\n\n6. The problem considers the difference between fn and fn with a_n set to zero (denoted as fn|_{a_n=0}), referred to as equation (1). For n=2,3, this difference is zero. The task is to prove for n ≥4, equation (1) is O(x^{2^{n-1} - 2n}) with leading coefficient divisible by 64.\n\nAdditional thoughts mention that equation (1) is divisible by a_n, and there's a homogeneity argument about degrees in variables x, sqrt(x1), ..., sqrt(xn).\n\nNow, structuring the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single line, each applying to one object. Let me list them:\n\n- The roots x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ satisfy the polynomial equation xⁿ + Σ_{k=0}^{n−1} (−1)^{n−k} a_{n−k} xᵏ = 0.\n- The coefficient aₙ is given by aₙ = (−1)ⁿ x₁x₂⋯xₙ.\n- The minimal polynomial of √x₁ + √x₂ + ... + √xₙ is PₙQₙ = fₙ² − aₙgₙ².\n- Pₙ is the product over all combinations of μ₁, ..., μₙ ∈ {±1} with μ₁⋯μₙ = 1 of (x − (μ₁√x₁ + ... + μₙ√xₙ)).\n- Qₙ is the product over all combinations of μ₁, ..., μₙ ∈ {±1} with μ₁⋯μₙ = −1 of (x − (μ₁√x₁ + ... + μₙ√xₙ)).\n- fₙ = (Pₙ + Qₙ)/2.\n- gₙ = (Qₙ − Pₙ)/(2√(x₁x₂⋯xₙ)).\n- Pₙ and Qₙ have leading term x^{2^{n−1}}.\n- The leading term of gₙ is 2^{n−1}(n−1)! x^{2^{n−1}−n}.\n- Pₙ and Qₙ are swapped under each automorphism ϕ_i: √x_i ↦ −√x_i.\n- fₙ and gₙ are invariant under each automorphism ϕ_i: √x_i ↦ −√x_i.\n- fₙ and gₙ are symmetric polynomials in x₁, ..., xₙ.\n- fₙ and gₙ can be expressed as polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials a₁, ..., aₙ.\n- For n = 2, 3, the difference fₙ − (fₙ|_{aₙ=0}) is zero.\n- The difference fₙ − (fₙ|_{aₙ=0}) is denoted as equation (1).\n- The problem is to prove for n ≥ 4, equation (1) is O(x^{2^{n−1}−2n}) and its leading coefficient is divisible by 64.\n\nWait, some of these are definitions rather than assumptions. The user wants assumptions of the problem. The problem is to prove the two properties about equation (1) for n ≥4. The assumptions would be the given conditions under which this problem is posed.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions would be the definitions given in the problem setup. But since the problem is about proving a property of equation (1), the assumptions are the properties and definitions provided that lead up to the problem statement.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions should be the given conditions, such as the definitions of Pn, Qn, fn, gn, their properties, and the prior results (like for n=2,3, equation (1) is zero). However, each assumption must address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's try to list them concisely:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are roots of the polynomial xⁿ + Σ_{k=0}^{n−1} (−1)^{n−k} a_{n−k} xᵏ = 0.\n- aₙ is defined as (−1)ⁿ x₁x₂⋯xₙ.\n- The minimal polynomial of √x₁ + √x₂ + ... + √xₙ is PₙQₙ = fₙ² − aₙgₙ², where Pₙ and Qₙ are products over sign combinations with product 1 and -1 respectively.\n- fₙ is defined as (Pₙ + Qₙ)/2.\n- gₙ is defined as (Qₙ − Pₙ)/(2√(x₁x₂⋯xₙ)).\n- Pₙ and Qₙ have leading term x^{2^{n−1}}.\n- The leading term of gₙ is 2^{n−1}(n−1)! x^{2^{n−1}−n}.\n- Pₙ and Qₙ are swapped under each automorphism negating a square root, making fₙ and gₙ invariant under such automorphisms.\n- fₙ and gₙ are symmetric polynomials in x₁, ..., xₙ, expressible in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials a₁, ..., aₙ.\n- For n = 2 and n = 3, the difference fₙ − (fₙ|_{aₙ=0}) equals zero.\n\nThe problem is then to prove for n ≥4, that this difference is O(x^{2^{n−1}−2n}) with leading coefficient divisible by 64.\n\nBut perhaps some of these can be combined or simplified. However, the example shows each assumption as a separate line. Let me try to list each assumption on a separate line, ensuring each is about one property.\n\nFinal list of assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ are roots of the polynomial $x^n + \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-k} a_{n-k} x^k = 0$,\n$a_n = (-1)^n x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n$,\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{x_1} + \\sqrt{x_2} + \\ldots + \\sqrt{x_n}$ is $P_n Q_n = f_n^2 - a_n g_n^2$,\n$P_n$ is the product over all $\\mu_1, \\ldots, \\mu_n \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$ with $\\mu_1 \\cdots \\mu_n = 1$ of $(x - (\\mu_1 \\sqrt{x_1} + \\ldots + \\mu_n \\sqrt{x_n}))$,\n$Q_n$ is the product over all $\\mu_1, \\ldots, \\mu_n \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$ with $\\mu_1 \\cdots \\mu_n = -1$ of $(x - (\\mu_1 \\sqrt{x_1} + \\ldots + \\mu_n \\sqrt{x_n}))$,\n$f_n = \\frac{P_n + Q_n}{2}$,\n$g_n = \\frac{Q_n - P_n}{2 \\sqrt{x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n}}$,\n$P_n$ and $Q_n$ have leading term $x^{2^{n-1}}$,\nThe leading term of $g_n$ is $2^{n-1} (n-1)! x^{2^{n-1} - n}$,\n$P_n$ and $Q_n$ are swapped under each automorphism $\\phi_i: \\sqrt{x_i} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{x_i}$,\n$f_n$ and $g_n$ are invariant under each automorphism $\\phi_i: \\sqrt{x_i} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{x_i}$,\n$f_n$ and $g_n$ are symmetric polynomials in $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$,\n$f_n$ and $g_n$ can be expressed as polynomials in elementary symmetric polynomials $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$,\nFor $n = 2, 3$, the difference $f_n - (f_n|_{a_n=0})$ equals zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for $n \\geq 4$, the difference $f_n - (f_n|_{a_n=0})$ is $O(x^{2^{n-1} - 2n})$ and its leading coefficient is divisible by 64.\n\nI think this covers all the necessary assumptions and states the problem as required. Each assumption is a single line addressing one property. The problem is clearly stated.",
