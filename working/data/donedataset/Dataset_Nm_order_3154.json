    "AcceptedAnswer": "By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, $\\mathrm{rank}(A)+\\mathrm{nullity}(A)=n$. The problem would be solved if you could show that $\\mathrm{rank}(B)\\leq\\mathrm{nullity}(A)$. Presumably, $AB=0$ will play a role in that, since the result is false otherwise (if $A$ and $B$ were both invertible, for example, then $AB\\neq 0$, and $\\mathrm{rank}(A)+\\mathrm{rank}(B) = 2n\\gt n$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that if two n×n matrices A and B multiply to zero (AB=0), then the sum of their ranks is at most n. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that A and B are both in ℝ^{n×n}, so they are square matrices of size n. The product AB equals zero. The conclusion is that rank(A) + rank(B) ≤ n. \n\nWait, in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, it was listed as an assumption. However, in the current problem, the user hasn't mentioned any additional assumptions beyond what's in the title and question. Let me check the original question again. The user's question says: \"If A,B ∈ ℝ^{n×n} and AB=0 then rank(A)+rank(B) ≤ n\". So the assumptions here are that A and B are n×n real matrices and their product is zero.\n\nSo, each assumption should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So first, A is an n×n real matrix. Second, B is an n×n real matrix. Third, their product AB equals the zero matrix. Then the problem is to prove that the sum of their ranks is at most n.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem there had \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe the example was modified? Hmm, perhaps the example was a case where the user made an error. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be incorrect. But perhaps the user provided a modified example. Anyway, perhaps the example is just to show the format, not correctness. So I should follow the current problem as given.\n\nSo, applying the format to the current problem. The assumptions are:\n\n1. A is an n×n real matrix.\n2. B is an n×n real matrix.\n3. The product AB is the zero matrix.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that rank(A) + rank(B) ≤ n.\n\nWait, but in the original problem's title, it's stated as \"AB=0 ⇒ Rank(A)+Rank(B) ≤ n\". So all the conditions are as mentioned. The example might have included an extra assumption because in that problem, maybe the user had a specific case where n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, there's no such extra condition. So the assumptions are exactly the three points above. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem from user: \"If A,B ∈ ℝ^{n×n} and AB=0 then rank(A)+rank(B) ≤ n\". So the conditions are that A and B are n×n real matrices, AB=0. So each condition per line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an element of ℝ^{n×n},\nB is an element of ℝ^{n×n},\nAB equals the zero matrix.\n\nProblem: Prove that rank(A) + rank(B) ≤ n.\n\nThat seems correct. I don't see any other hidden assumptions. The example given by the user included an assumption not present in the original problem (about n being divisible by 7), but perhaps that was a mistake. However, in the current problem, we just need to list the given assumptions. So I think that's the correct way to structure it.",
