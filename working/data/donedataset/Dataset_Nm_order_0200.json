    "Content": "Sylvester's determinant identity states that if $A$ and $B$ are matrices of sizes $m\\times n$ and $n\\times m$, then $$ \\det(I_m+AB) = \\det(I_n+BA)$$ where $I_m$ and $I_n$ denote the $m \\times m$ and $n \\times n$ identity matrices, respectively. Could you sketch a proof for me, or point to an accessible reference?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint $ $ Work universally , i.e. consider the matrix entries as indeterminates $\\:\\!\\rm a_{\\:\\!ij},b_{\\:\\!ij}.\\,$ Adjoin them to $\\,\\Bbb Z\\,$ to get the polynomial ring $\\rm R = \\mathbb Z[a_{\\:\\!ij},b_{\\:\\!ij}].\\, $ In this polynomial ring $\\rm R,$ compute the determinant of $\\rm\\, (1+A B) A = A (1+BA)\\,$ then cancel the nonzero polynomial $\\rm\\, det(A)\\, $ (valid by $\\rm R$ a domain). $ $ Extend to non-square matrices by padding appropriately with $0$ 's and $1$ 's to get square matrices. Note that the proof is purely algebraic - it does not require any topological notions (e.g. (Zariski) density ). Alternatively we may employ Schur decomposition as follows $$\\rm\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & \\rm A \\\\\n\\rm B & 1 \\end{array} \\right]\\, =\\, \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & \\rm 0 \\\\\n\\rm B & 1 \\end{array} \\right]\\ \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & \\rm 0 \\\\\n\\rm 0 & \\rm 1\\!-\\!BA \\end{array} \\right]\\ \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & \\rm A \\\\\n\\rm 0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right]\\qquad$$ $$\\rm\\phantom{\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & \\rm B \\\\\n\\rm A & 1 \\end{array} \\right]}\\, =\\, \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & \\rm A \\\\\n\\rm 0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right]\\ \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\rm 1\\!-\\!AB & \\rm 0 \\\\\n\\rm 0 & \\rm 1 \\end{array} \\right]\\ \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & \\rm 0 \\\\\n\\rm B & 1 \\end{array} \\right]\\qquad$$ See this answer for more on universality of polynomial identities, universal cancellation (before evaluation) and closely relation topics, and see also this sci.math thread on 9 Nov 2007.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and identify the key assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe title of the question is about proving Sylvester's determinant identity. The user provided the identity: det(I_m + AB) = det(I_n + BA), where A is m×n and B is n×m. The question asks for a proof sketch or a reference.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. However, in the problem here, Sylvester's determinant identity doesn't explicitly state any divisibility conditions. Instead, the conditions are about the dimensions of the matrices A and B.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. A is a matrix of size m×n.\n2. B is a matrix of size n×m.\n3. I_m is the m×m identity matrix.\n4. I_n is the n×n identity matrix.\n\nThese are the essential components given in the problem statement. Each assumption relates to a specific object (A, B, I_m, I_n) and their properties (dimensions). The problem then is to prove the determinant identity as stated.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line and applies to one object. The problem statement is straightforward: prove that det(I_m + AB) equals det(I_n + BA). \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7), but in this case, the original problem doesn't mention any such conditions beyond the matrix dimensions. So perhaps the only assumptions are the sizes of the matrices and the identity matrices. There's no mention of any other constraints like invertibility or specific values in the matrices. Therefore, the assumptions are purely about the dimensions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these four assumptions and then state the problem as proving the determinant identity. Let me check again the original question to ensure I didn't miss any assumptions. The user wrote: \"if A and B are matrices of sizes m×n and n×m, then...\" So the assumptions are exactly the matrix dimensions. The identity matrices are defined by their size, so I_m is m×m and I_n is n×n. Therefore, each of these should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer should have four assumptions, each on a separate line, and then the problem statement as given.",
