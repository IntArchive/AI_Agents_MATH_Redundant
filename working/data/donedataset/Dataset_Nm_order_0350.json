    "AcceptedAnswer": "From a friend who doesn't want to use math.se... Write the inequality as\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1+x} \\left(1+x\\right)^{1+\\frac{1}{x}}  + \\frac{x}{1+x} \\left(1+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1+x} \\leq 4.$$ Let $f(x) =(1+x)^{1+\\frac{1}{x}}$.  If $f$ is concave, then we are done since this means that $$4=f(1)=f((1- \\alpha)x + \\alpha y)) \\geq (1- \\alpha) f(x) + \\alpha f(y) = \\frac{1}{1+x} \\left(1+x\\right)^{1+\\frac{1}{x}}  + \\frac{x}{1+x} \\left(1+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1+x}$$ with $\\alpha = \\frac{x}{1+x}, 1-\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1+x},$ and $y = \\frac{1}{x}$.  So, we will show that $f$ is concave. Note that if $f(x) = e^{g(x)}$ and $g''(x) + g'(x)^2 \\leq 0$ for all $x$, then $f$ is concave. So, consider $g(x) = (1+\\frac{1}{x}) \\log (1+x).$  Then we have that\n$$g''(x) + g'(x)^2 \\leq 0 \\leftrightarrow \\log(1+x) \\leq \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x}}$$ Note that $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\log(1+x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x}}=0.$ By AM-GM, \n$$\\frac{1}{1+x} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\log(1+x) \\leq \\frac{x+2}{2(1+x)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x}} $$ So, $$\\log(1+x) = \\int_0^x \\log (1+x) ' dx \\leq \\int_0^x \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x}}\\right)' dx = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x}}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is to prove that the function f(x) = (1+x)^(1/x) + (1 + 1/x)^x is less than or equal to 4 for all x > 0. They also mention some properties: f(x) = f(1/x), the derivative f’(x) = -1/x² f’(1/x), and that it's sufficient to prove f’(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The main assumptions here are:\n\n1. The function f(x) is defined as (1+x)^(1/x) + (1 + 1/x)^x.\n2. The domain of x is all positive real numbers (x > 0).\n3. The function has the symmetry property f(x) = f(1/x).\n4. The derivative relationship f’(x) = - (1/x²) f’(1/x).\n5. The problem reduces to showing f’(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1, which would help in proving the inequality f(x) ≤ 4.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions are listed as individual conditions, each applying to one object. So I need to break down each condition line by line. Let me check:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a positive real number (x > 0).\n- The function f(x) is defined as (1+x)^{1/x} + (1 + 1/x)^x.\n- The function satisfies f(x) = f(1/x) for all x > 0.\n- The derivative of f(x) satisfies f’(x) = - (1/x²) f’(1/x).\n- The problem requires proving f(x) ≤ 4 for all x > 0.\n- It is sufficient to prove that f’(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1.\n\nWait, but the problem statement includes the inequality to prove and the approach. However, in the example provided, the problem line is just the main statement to prove, while the assumptions include the given conditions. So maybe the \"sufficient to prove f’(x) >0\" is part of the problem-solving approach, not an assumption. The original problem statement is to prove the inequality, and the user mentions some properties that they have derived. But in the format, the \"Assumption\" part should list all given conditions or properties that are taken as true for the problem. However, the problem might not explicitly state all these, but the user provides them as part of their attempt. \n\nWait, the original question on Math Stack Exchange is written by the user, so the problem is as stated: \"Prove that f(x)=... ≤4 for all x>0.\" Then the user adds that they have found f(x) = f(1/x), f’(x) = -1/x² f’(1/x), so they need only prove f’(x) >0 for 0<x<1. \n\nBut in the problem structure, the \"Assumption\" part should include the given conditions of the problem. The problem itself is to prove the inequality. However, the user provides some properties they have derived, which might be part of their solution approach, not the problem's assumptions. \n\nBut in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it wasn't mentioned. Wait, no. Wait the original example was: \n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", but that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in the example? Because the original problem is for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they have added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually be incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but if in the formatted problem, they have added \"n is divisible by 7\", that would limit the problem. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is wrong. \n\nBut regardless, following the user's instruction, I need to format the current problem. The current problem's original question is to prove the inequality, and the user mentions that f(x) = f(1/x), f’(x) = -1/x² f’(1/x), and that it's sufficient to prove f’(x) >0 for 0 < x <1. So in the problem statement, the user is presenting their approach, but the actual problem to be proven is the inequality. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include the properties given in the problem (if they are part of the problem's conditions) or if they are derived by the user. \n\nBut in the example, the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it. That suggests that perhaps the assistant in the example made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was edited. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption. For example, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the user's presentation, it was unclear. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nBut moving forward, according to the user's instruction, the task is to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So, in the given example, the user probably had an original problem where the divisibility by 91 was the main claim, but the assumption that n is divisible by 7 was part of the problem (maybe the original problem had that n is an integer divisible by 7, but the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but in reality, the problem may have specified n divisible by 7. That's possible. So perhaps there was a mistake in the original problem statement as presented. \n\nBut in any case, for the current problem, we need to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem. \n\nThe original problem is: Prove that (1+x)^{1/x} + (1 +1/x)^x ≤4 for all x >0. The user mentions that f(x) = f(1/x), f’(x) = -1/x² f’(1/x), so they only need to prove f’(x) >0 for 0 <x <1. \n\nNow, in structuring this, the assumptions would be the given conditions and properties that are part of the problem. The problem itself is to prove the inequality. The user's additional observations (symmetry and derivative relationship) are part of their solution approach, but are they part of the problem's assumptions? \n\nThe problem as posed is to prove the inequality. The fact that f(x) = f(1/x) and the derivative relationship may be properties that the user has derived, but they are not given in the problem statement. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be only the conditions given in the problem. \n\nHowever, the user's question includes those properties as part of their attempt. But in the example, the formatted problem included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which suggests that maybe the assistant added that as an assumption. But that seems incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the user wants the assistant to extract all the conditions from the original problem, not add new ones. So in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem in the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect unless the original problem had that condition. But maybe the original problem was different. \n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the original problem is to prove the inequality for all x>0. The user mentions that f(x)=f(1/x) and the derivative relationship, and that it's sufficient to prove f’(x) >0 for 0<x<1. \n\nNow, the question is: are these properties (f(x)=f(1/x), derivative relationship) part of the problem's given conditions, or are they part of the user's solution attempt? \n\nSince the user wrote: \"We have f(x)=f(1/x), f'(x)= -1/x² f'(1/x), so we only need to prove f'(x)＞0 for 0 < x <1.\" \n\nThis suggests that the user has derived these properties and is using them in their solution. Therefore, these are not assumptions given in the problem statement but rather part of their solution approach. Therefore, in structuring the problem, the assumptions should only include what is given in the problem statement, which is x>0 and the definition of f(x). The rest are part of the solution approach. \n\nHowever, in the example, the formatted problem included an assumption that was not in the original problem statement. This suggests that maybe the user wants to include any mathematical properties that are given in the problem statement, even if they are derived by the user. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to include all mathematical facts presented in the question as assumptions. \n\nIn the current problem, the original problem is to prove the inequality. The user's question includes the fact that f(x) = f(1/x), the derivative relationship, and the sufficiency to prove f’(x) >0 for 0<x<1. These are part of the user's solution approach, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be: \n\n- x is a positive real number (x > 0)\n- f(x) is defined as (1+x)^{1/x} + (1 + 1/x)^x\n\nThe problem is to prove that f(x) ≤4 for all x>0.\n\nHowever, the user might have intended to include the properties they mentioned as assumptions, but according to standard problem structuring, the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is what needs to be proven. The user's approach (using symmetry and derivative) is part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions. \n\nBut in the example provided by the user, they included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". This suggests that the example might be flawed, or perhaps there was a misinterpretation. \n\nGiven that, maybe the user wants all mentioned mathematical statements in the question to be listed as assumptions, even if they are part of the solution approach. In the current problem, the user says \"We have f(x)=f(1/x), f'(x)= -1/x² f'(1/x), so we only need to prove f'(x)＞0 for 0 < x <1.\" So these are presented as given facts. Therefore, if we follow the example's approach, perhaps we need to include these as assumptions. \n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a positive real number (x > 0)\n- f(x) is defined as (1+x)^{1/x} + (1 + 1/x)^x\n- f(x) = f(1/x) for all x >0\n- The derivative f’(x) = - (1/x²) f’(1/x)\n- It is sufficient to prove f’(x) >0 for 0 <x <1\n\nBut the problem to prove is still the inequality f(x) ≤4. However, in the example, the problem was restated with some assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem kept that as the problem, but added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Which seems contradictory. \n\nBut perhaps the example is incorrect. Given that confusion, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem by filtering unrelated information and listing assumptions. \n\nIn the current problem, the main problem is to prove f(x) ≤4 for x>0. The user mentions the symmetry and derivative properties, which are part of their reasoning. However, in the problem structure, the assumptions should be the given conditions. Since the problem is to prove the inequality, the only assumptions are x>0 and the definition of f(x). The other properties (symmetry, derivative relationship) are part of the solution approach, not the problem's assumptions. \n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Therefore, there's inconsistency. To resolve this, perhaps the user wants all mentioned mathematical statements in the question to be considered as assumptions. In the example, maybe the original problem had an implicit assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote it as \"for every integer n\", which was incorrect. \n\nBut given the ambiguity, I think the safest approach is to list the explicitly given conditions in the problem statement as assumptions. In the current problem, the problem statement is: Prove that f(x) = ... ≤4 for all x>0. The user then adds that they have found f(x)=f(1/x), etc. Therefore, the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a positive real number (x > 0)\n- f(x) is defined as (1+x)^{1/x} + (1 + 1/x)^x\n- f(x) = f(1/x) for all x >0\n- The derivative of f(x) satisfies f’(x) = - (1/x²) f’(1/x)\n- The problem requires proving f’(x) >0 for 0 <x <1 to establish the inequality\n\nBut the last point is part of the solution approach, not an assumption. So maybe it's better to exclude it. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the inequality, and the user is suggesting a method which involves proving f’(x) >0. So the actual problem remains the inequality. \n\nGiven the example provided by the user, where the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7 (which might be necessary for the divisibility by 91, as 91=7*13), perhaps the user wants to list all necessary conditions for the problem to hold. However, in that case, the original problem might have been misstated. \n\nGiven the confusion, I think the correct approach here is to structure the problem as follows:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a positive real number (x > 0)\n- f(x) is defined as (1+x)^{1/x} + (1 + 1/x)^x\n- f(x) = f(1/x) for all x >0\n- The derivative of f(x) satisfies f’(x) = - (1/x²) f’(1/x)\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) ≤4 for all x >0.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the inequality, and the assumptions include the properties given in the problem statement. However, the symmetry and derivative relationship are part of the user's solution approach, not part of the original problem's assumptions. Therefore, they shouldn't be included. \n\nWait, the original problem statement is only: Prove that f(x) = ... ≤4 for all x>0. The rest (f(x)=f(1/x), etc.) are part of the user's solution attempt. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be only:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a positive real number (x > 0)\n- f(x) is defined as (1+x)^{1/x} + (1 + 1/x)^x\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) ≤4 for all x >0.\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which complicates things. However, following the example's structure, perhaps the user wants to include any mathematical properties mentioned in the question as assumptions, even if they are part of the solution. \n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Since 91=13*7, perhaps the problem requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but in the example, only 7 is mentioned. This suggests the example might have been structured incorrectly. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to include all mathematical conditions necessary to solve the problem, even if they are derived. However, this is speculative. \n\nIn the current problem, the user mentions that f(x) = f(1/x) and the derivative relationship. If we follow the example's approach, these would be included as assumptions. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nx is a positive real number,\nf(x) is defined as $(1+x)^{1/x} + (1 + \\frac{1}{x})^x$,\nf(x) satisfies $f(x) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$ for all $x > 0$,\nthe derivative of f(x) satisfies $f'(x) = -\\frac{1}{x^2} f'\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $f(x) \\leq 4$ for all $x > 0$.\n\nBut the original problem only states to prove the inequality. The other properties are part of the user's solution. However, the user included them in their question, so perhaps they should be considered as given conditions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be presented as needing to use those properties to prove the inequality, making them part of the problem's assumptions. \n\nGiven the example's inconsistency, I think the best way is to include the explicitly mentioned mathematical properties as assumptions, even if they are part of the solution approach. Therefore, the answer would be as above.",
