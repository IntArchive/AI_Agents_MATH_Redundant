    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows breaking down the assumptions into individual points and restating the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is \"Proof of upper-tail inequality for standard normal distribution,\" and the question states that if X is a standard normal variable, then for x > 0, the probability that X exceeds x is less than or equal to exp(-x²/2) divided by (x sqrt(2 pi)).\n\nSo, the task is to list each assumption line by line. The problem mentions X follows a standard normal distribution, which is N(0,1). Then, there's the condition that x is greater than 0. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n1. X is a standard normal random variable (i.e., X ~ N(0,1)).\n2. x is a real number greater than 0.\n\nThe problem part is to show the inequality involving the tail probability. I need to ensure that the problem statement is concise and matches the original question. Also, check that all variables are covered in assumptions. Since the original problem didn't mention any other conditions, these two assumptions should suffice.\n\nWait, should I split the first assumption into two parts? Like, mean 0 and variance 1? But the example given in the user's example combines properties into one line for an object. Since X ~ N(0,1) is a single property about X, it's better to keep it as one line. Similarly, x > 0 is another line.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
