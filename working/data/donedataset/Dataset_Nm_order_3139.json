    "Content": "So what I'm looking for is a proof for when does the equality hold in Minkowski's inequality?\nI'm talking about this form of inequality: $$\\left( \\sum_{K=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k|^p\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} + \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |y_k|^p\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}$$ Not the one using integrals. I know when does the equality hold, I just can't figure out how to prove it. It holds when (X1, ..., Xn) = c*(Y1, ..., Yn), where c is a real constant (this is similar to Holder's inequality which I used to prove Minkowski's inequality). So can I just point out that it similarly holds in Minkowski's case, as I suppose it does? Thanks. EDIT: I proved that if (X1, ..., Xn) = c*(Y1, ..., Yn) , then the equality holds. Now, how to do in reverse - if equality holds, then (X1, ..., Xn) = c*(Y1, ..., Yn) ? Because these are equivalent.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The case where $p=1$ , the Minkowski's Inequality is nothing but a bunch of triangle inequalities of real numbers, \nthat is $$\\left( \\sum_{K=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\n\\le \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k|^p\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} + \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |y_k|^p\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}},\n$$ when $p=1$ , is $$\n \\sum_{K=1}^n |x_k + y_k|\n\\le  \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k| + \\sum_{k=1}^n |y_k|.\n$$ Equality holds when $x_ky_k\\ge0$ , for each k, that is $x_k$ and $y_k$ are either both non-negative or non-positive. So, that gives $x_k=c_ky_k$ , for some positive $c_k$ , for eack $k$ . For the case $p>1$ I assume you used \\begin{align*}\n\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^p \\right)\n& =\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^{p-1}|x_k + y_k| \\right) \\\\\n& \\le \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^{p-1}|x_k|+\\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^{p-1}|y_k|,\n\\end{align*} that is a triangle inequality, followed by Hölder's inequality: $$\n\\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^{p-1}|x_k|\n\\le \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n|x_k|^{p}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n|x_k+y_k|^{(p-1)q}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{q}},\n\\quad \\text{where } \\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1.\n$$ and similarly, $$\n\\sum_{K=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^{p-1}|y_k|\n\\le \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n|y_k|^{p}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n|x_k+y_k|^{(p-1)q}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{q}}.\n$$ and added the expressions to get the desired result. So, to have equality in Minkowski's inequality we must have equality in both applications of Hölder's inequality and the triangle inequality, i.e., $\\, \\exists \\, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2 \\ge 0$ s.t., \\begin{align*}\n|x_k|^p\n=\\lambda_1|x_k+y_k|^{(p-1)q}, \\qquad\n|y_k|^p\n=\\lambda_2|x_k+y_k|^{(p-1)q} \\tag{1}\n\\end{align*} and \\begin{align*}\n|x_k+y_k|\n=|x_k|+|y_k|, \\tag{2}\n\\end{align*} for $k = 1,2, \\cdots, n$ . WLOG we may assume $\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2 > 0$ . Therefore, from $(1)$ we have $|x_k|^p = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2}\\right)|y_k|^p$ . Again for equality to hold in $(2)$ $x_k$ and $y_k$ must have same sign. So, that gives us the equality condition to be $x_k = cy_k$ , for $k = 1,2, \\cdots, n$ with $c = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2}\\right)^{1/p}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. The original question is about when equality holds in Minkowski's inequality in the case of sums, not integrals. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The Minkowski inequality here is given in the form of finite sums. The user mentions that equality holds when one vector is a scalar multiple of the other, similar to Holder's inequality. The problem is to prove both directions: if the vectors are scalar multiples, then equality holds, and conversely, if equality holds, then the vectors must be scalar multiples.\n\nSo the assumptions here would relate to the conditions under which equality occurs. The problem statement is to prove the equality condition. But looking at the example provided, the assumptions listed were specific conditions on the variables. In this case, the key conditions are about the vectors being scalar multiples. However, since the user is asking for the proof of both directions, perhaps the assumptions need to be broken down.\n\nWait, but the example only lists assumptions given in the original problem. The original problem here states that the equality holds when (X1,...,Xn) = c*(Y1,...,Yn). The user wants to prove both directions. So the assumptions for each part might differ. However, the format seems to require listing all assumptions of the problem. The problem here is to show that equality in Minkowski's inequality holds if and only if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other. \n\nBut how to structure the assumptions? The problem itself is about the conditions for equality. The user mentions the form of Minkowski's inequality with sums, and specifies that the equality holds when vectors are proportional. The assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed: that we're dealing with real numbers, the p-norm, finite sums, etc.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's prompt includes assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Those are specific conditions given in the problem. But in this Minkowski case, the original problem doesn't state any specific conditions except the structure of the inequality and the vectors. So maybe the assumptions here are the general setup: vectors are real sequences, the p-norm is being used, etc.\n\nBut the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's given conditions. The original problem here doesn't have any explicit conditions beyond the inequality form. The user is asking about when equality occurs, which is part of the problem statement. So perhaps the assumptions are implicit in the problem's context: that we're working in real numbers, with finite sums, p >=1 (since Minkowski's inequality holds for p >=1). Wait, but the problem as stated doesn't mention p's range. However, Minkowski's inequality typically requires p ≥ 1. So maybe that's an assumption.\n\nBut the original problem's user didn't specify p's value. The user's question says \"I know when equality holds, just can't figure out how to prove it\". The answer needs to structure the problem by listing assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. p is a real number such that p ≥ 1.\n2. x_k and y_k are real numbers for each k from 1 to n.\n3. The sums involved are finite.\n\nBut the user's example listed specific conditions on n. However, in the current problem, the key conditions for equality are when one vector is a scalar multiple of the other. But those are part of the problem's conclusion, not the assumptions. Wait, the example's assumptions included \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" which was part of the problem's given conditions. In the current problem, the user's original question doesn't state any such specific conditions on the variables except the equality condition. So maybe the assumptions here are the general setup required for Minkowski's inequality to hold. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- For each k in {1, 2, ..., n}, x_k and y_k are real numbers.\n- The exponent p satisfies p ≥ 1.\n- The sums are taken over finite sequences of length n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that equality in Minkowski's inequality \n$$\n\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k|^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} + \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |y_k|^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\n$$\nholds if and only if there exists a real constant c such that (x_1, ..., x_n) = c(y_1, ..., y_n).\n\nWait, but the original question mentions that the user already proved one direction (if vectors are proportional, then equality holds) and needs to prove the converse. So perhaps the problem is to prove both directions. But the user's problem statement is \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but in this case, the problem is to establish the equality condition. The example given by the user included specific assumptions, but in this problem, the key thing is the equality condition. However, the user's original problem as stated doesn't have any explicit assumptions beyond the inequality's form. So perhaps the assumptions are the standard conditions for Minkowski's inequality to hold. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a real number with p ≥ 1,\n- For each k = 1, 2, ..., n, x_k and y_k are real numbers,\n- The sums are finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that equality holds in Minkowski's inequality if and only if there exists a real constant c ≥ 0 such that either (x_1, ..., x_n) = c(y_1, ..., y_n) or (y_1, ..., y_n) = c(x_1, ..., x_n).\n\nWait, but the original question states that the user knows equality holds when (X1,...,Xn) = c*(Y1,...,Yn). So maybe the problem is to show that this is the case. But the user is asking to prove both directions: if proportionality holds, then equality, and conversely. But in terms of structuring, perhaps the problem is to prove the equivalence. So the problem statement is to prove that equality occurs if and only if the vectors are proportional. The assumptions are the standard conditions under which Minkowski's inequality is stated. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a real number such that p > 1,\n- For each k = 1, 2, ..., n, x_k and y_k are real numbers,\n- The sums are finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that equality in Minkowski's inequality \n$$\n\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k + y_k|^p \\right)^{1/p} = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k|^p \\right)^{1/p} + \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n |y_k|^p \\right)^{1/p}\n$$\nholds if and only if there exists a non-negative real constant c such that either x_k = c y_k for all k or y_k = c x_k for all k.\n\nWait, but in Minkowski's inequality, the equality condition is that the vectors are non-negative multiples, not just any real constant. Because if they are scalar multiples with a negative constant, that might not work. For example, if y_k = -c x_k, then adding them could result in cancellation, which might not achieve equality. So perhaps the constant should be non-negative. The user in their original question mentions \"c is a real constant\", but in reality, for equality in Minkowski's inequality, the vectors need to be non-negatively proportional. So that's a detail to consider. However, the original question's user might have simplified it, stating just a real constant. But since the user is asking for help, it's better to be precise. However, the problem structure should reflect the original question's content. The user wrote \"c is a real constant (this is similar to Holder's inequality...)\", so in the problem statement, it's correct to state \"real constant\", even though technically it's a non-negative constant. But maybe the original problem's answer requires that. Hmm. But since the user's example didn't correct the original problem's statement, I should follow what the user provided. The original user's problem states \"c is a real constant\". So perhaps the problem statement should reflect that, even if in reality, the constant must be non-negative. But maybe the user is mistaken. However, as per the user's original question, they say \"when (X1,...,Xn) = c*(Y1,...,Yn), where c is a real constant\", so the problem statement should follow that.\n\nTherefore, structuring according to the user's example:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a real number with p ≥ 1,\n- x_k and y_k are real numbers for each k in {1, 2, ..., n},\n- The sums are finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that equality holds in Minkowski's inequality if and only if there exists a real constant c such that (x_1, ..., x_n) = c(y_1, ..., y_n).\n\nBut wait, in Minkowski's inequality, the equality condition also requires that the vectors are non-negatively proportional. So if the user's original problem says \"real constant\", maybe that's part of the problem's inaccuracy. But since we are to structure the problem as per the user's question, which mentions \"real constant\", then we should include that. However, to be precise, the actual condition requires the constant to be non-negative, but the user might not be aware of that. Alternatively, maybe in their problem's context, the vectors are non-negative, so the constant can be real. But the user doesn't specify. However, in the standard Minkowski inequality for real vectors, the equality condition is when one vector is a non-negative scalar multiple of the other. So perhaps the problem should state \"non-negative real constant\". But the user's original question says \"real constant\". \n\nGiven that, I think the answer should stick to what the user provided, unless there's a mistake. Since the user is seeking help, it's possible they have a mistake in stating the condition. But since we are to structure their problem as per their description, we should follow their wording. Hence, the assumption would include the standard Minkowski conditions (p ≥1, real numbers, finite sums), and the problem is to prove the equivalence with a real constant c. However, in the problem statement, perhaps the correct condition is non-negative c. But given the user's original question, perhaps it's better to present as they wrote. \n\nAlternatively, the user might be confused between Holder and Minkowski. In Holder's inequality, equality holds when the vectors are proportional up to a power, but in Minkowski's case, it's non-negative proportionality. \n\nBut since the user says \"I know when does the equality hold, I just can't figure out how to prove it. It holds when (X1, ..., Xn) = c*(Y1, ..., Yn), where c is a real constant (this is similar to Holder's inequality...)\". So they are asserting that the equality condition is proportionality by any real constant. Therefore, structuring the problem as per the user's understanding, even if it's slightly incorrect. \n\nHence, the structured problem would have assumptions on p and the vectors, and the problem is to prove the equivalence as the user states.",
