    "Content": "It was not until recently (why don't they teach it in secondary school?) that I've come across the Generalised Binomial Theorem , which from what I can tell is basically the same as the regular Binomial Theorem, except that the finite sum is replace by an infinite series: $$\n(x+y)^n=\\sum^{n}_{r=0}\\binom{n}{r}x^{n-r}y^r=\\sum^{\\infty}_{r=0}\\binom{n}{r}x^{n-r}y^r\n$$ Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any clear explanation of how to get from the regular theorem to the generalised one, the only proof I found being based on some obscure mathematics, while my math book entirely skips the explanation. Hence, my question is how do you prove the generalised theorem by deriving it from the regular theorem or otherwise?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is another approach: The formula\n$$(1+x)^\\alpha=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {\\alpha\\choose k}\\, x^k\\qquad(1)$$\nis true for $\\alpha\\in{\\mathbb N}$; so maybe its true for arbitrary $\\alpha$. To find out fix an $\\alpha\\in{\\mathbb R}$ and consider the function\n$$f(x):=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {\\alpha\\choose k}\\, x^k\\qquad(|x|<1)\\ .$$\nUsing termwise differentiation one obtains\n$$f'(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {\\alpha\\choose k}\\,k\\, x^{k-1}=\\sum_{k'=0}^\\infty {\\alpha\\choose k'+1}\\,(k'+1)\\, x^{k'}=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {\\alpha\\choose k}\\,(\\alpha -k)\\, x^k\\ .$$\nTherefore, using the third and the first  expression for $f'(x)$, we get\n$$(1+x)f'(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {\\alpha\\choose k}\\,(\\alpha -k)\\, x^k+\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {\\alpha\\choose k}\\,k\\, x^k=\\alpha f(x)\\ ,$$\nor\n$$(1+x)f'(x)-\\alpha f(x)\\equiv0\\ .$$\nIt follows that ${d\\over dx}\\bigl((1+x)^{-\\alpha} f(x)\\bigr)\\equiv0$, or $(1+x)^{-\\alpha} f(x)={\\rm const.}$, and as $f(0)=1$ one concludes that $f(x)\\equiv (1+x)^\\alpha$; whence $(1)$ is indeed true for $|x|<1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving the Generalized Binomial Theorem by deriving it from the regular Binomial Theorem or another method.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Looking at the original question:\n\nThe user mentions the Generalized Binomial Theorem, comparing it to the regular Binomial Theorem. The key points are that the regular theorem uses a finite sum, while the generalized version uses an infinite series. The user is asking for a proof that connects these two, possibly starting from the regular theorem.\n\nAssumptions here might include the conditions under which the Generalized Binomial Theorem holds. For example, the convergence criteria for the infinite series, which typically require |y/x| < 1. Also, the exponent in the Generalized Binomial Theorem isn't necessarily a non-negative integer; it can be any real or complex number. The original Binomial Theorem is for non-negative integer exponents. So, the assumptions would involve these conditions.\n\nLet me list possible assumptions:\n\n1. The exponent n is a real or complex number (since the regular theorem uses integers, the generalized extends this).\n2. The absolute value of y/x is less than 1 (to ensure convergence of the infinite series).\n3. The binomial coefficients are generalized using the formula involving factorials or the Gamma function for non-integer n.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the user's question doesn't explicitly mention these conditions. The user's question says: \"how do you prove the generalised theorem by deriving it from the regular theorem or otherwise?\" So maybe the assumptions are part of the problem's setup. However, the example given in the problem included an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the question is about moving from finite to infinite sum, so the key assumptions would relate to the conditions needed for the infinite series to hold, like convergence and the exponent not being a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the problem as phrased in the user's question is asking for the proof method, not stating specific numerical conditions. The example given had specific mathematical conditions. So perhaps the assumptions here are the conditions under which the Generalized Binomial Theorem is valid. The problem is to prove it, possibly under those conditions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- The exponent n is any real or complex number (not necessarily a non-negative integer).\n- The series converges, which typically requires |y/x| < 1.\n- The binomial coefficients are generalized using the formula with falling factorials or Gamma functions.\n\nBut the original question's problem statement doesn't specify these; the user is asking how to prove the theorem, possibly starting from the regular Binomial Theorem. The answer's format requires listing assumptions of the problem. However, the original problem as presented in the question might not explicitly state all assumptions. The user is seeking a derivation from the regular theorem or another method.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, the assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. However, in the actual problem statement, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that example seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps the user in the example made a mistake, but perhaps the actual problem had a hidden assumption or maybe there was a typo. Alternatively, maybe the example was altered. But perhaps in the actual problem, the original problem required n to be divisible by 7, but the way it was written might have been unclear. So, the assistant had to extract the correct assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question is about proving the Generalized Binomial Theorem from the regular one. The problem as stated in the question doesn't explicitly list the assumptions, but the Generalized Binomial Theorem does have certain conditions. So to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should be those necessary for the Generalized Binomial Theorem to hold.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The exponent n is a real or complex number.\n2. The absolute value of y/x is less than 1 (to ensure convergence).\n3. The binomial coefficients are defined using the generalized formula: \\(\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-r+1)}{r!}\\).\n\nThese are the standard conditions for the Generalized Binomial Theorem. Therefore, the problem would be to prove that under these assumptions, the equality \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{r=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{n}{r} x^{n - r} y^r\\) holds.\n\nBut the original question's problem statement in the user's post doesn't mention these assumptions explicitly. The user is asking how to derive the Generalized Binomial Theorem from the regular one. So perhaps the problem is to show that when n is not a non-negative integer, and under convergence conditions, the expansion holds as an infinite series. Therefore, the assumptions should include that n is not a non-negative integer (since otherwise it's the regular theorem), and the convergence condition.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would list the assumptions as:\n\n- \\(n\\) is a real or complex number (not necessarily a non-negative integer).\n- \\(|y| < |x|\\) (or \\(|y/x| < 1\\)) to ensure convergence of the infinite series.\n\nThe problem is to prove that \\((x + y)^n\\) can be expressed as the infinite series \\(\\sum_{r=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{n}{r} x^{n - r} y^r\\) under these assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking for deriving from the regular theorem, perhaps the assumption is that the regular Binomial Theorem is known, and we need to extend it. But the example given in the problem includes assumptions on the variables in the problem, so I think the correct approach is to list the mathematical conditions required for the Generalized Binomial Theorem.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\(n\\) is a real or complex number,\n- \\(| \\frac{y}{x} | < 1\\),\n- the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{r}\\) is generalized as \\(\\frac{n(n-1)\\cdots(n - r + 1)}{r!}\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$(x + y)^n = \\sum_{r=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{n}{r} x^{n - r} y^r$$ under the given assumptions.\n\nBut the user's original question doesn't state all these explicitly. The user's question is about how to prove the Generalized Binomial Theorem by deriving it from the regular theorem or otherwise, and mentions that the finite sum is replaced by an infinite series.\n\nSo perhaps the key assumptions are the conditions under which the infinite series converges and the exponent is not a non-negative integer. The problem is to show the equality under these conditions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\(n\\) is a real or complex number (not restricted to non-negative integers),\n- \\(|y| < |x|\\),\n- the binomial coefficients \\(\\binom{n}{r}\\) are defined for real/complex \\(n\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Generalised Binomial Theorem holds: $$(x+y)^n = \\sum_{r=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{n}{r} x^{n - r} y^r.$$\n\nEach assumption is listed line by line. The first line addresses the nature of \\(n\\), the second the convergence condition, and the third the definition of the binomial coefficients. Then the problem is to prove the equality.",
