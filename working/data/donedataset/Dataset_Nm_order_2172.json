    "Content": "While solving another problem (specifically Exercise 7.2 in Atiyah & Macdonald's Introduction to  Commutative Algebra ), I got stuck in the following step: If $R$ is an integral domain, how I can prove that $R[[x]]$ is an\n  integral domain? Here $R[[x]]$ is the set of all formal series in $x$ with coefficients in $R$. So typical element of $R[[x]]$ would have the form $a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\\cdots$ where $a_i\\in R$. So I need to prove that if\n$$\n(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\\cdots)(b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\\cdots)=0\n$$\nthen $a_i=0$ and $b_i=0$ for all $i\\ge 0$. Now, I am not particularly fond of opening up those brackets :( Is there any slick way of proving this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Choose $f,g \\in R[[x]]$ that are non-zero. With $f = a_0 + a_1x + \\ldots$ and $g = b_0 + b_1x + \\ldots$ let $a_i$ and $b_j$ be respectively the coefficients of the smallest non-zero terms in $f$ and $g$. Then $fg = a_ib_jx^{i+j} + \\text{(higher order terms)}$ and thus is non-zero. Done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that if R is an integral domain, then the ring of formal power series R[[x]] is also an integral domain. Hmm, integral domains are rings where there are no zero divisors, right? So, if two elements multiply to zero, one of them must be zero. \n\nThe question mentions that in R[[x]], a typical element is a formal power series like a0 + a1x + a2x² + ... and similarly for another series with coefficients bi. The product of two such series is given to be zero, and we need to show that all coefficients ai and bi must be zero. \n\nWait, the key here is probably looking at the coefficients of the product. When you multiply two power series, the coefficient of each xⁿ in the product is the sum of a_i*b_j where i + j = n. So, if the product is zero, all those coefficients must be zero. \n\nBut how do we proceed? Maybe induction? Let's see. Suppose f and g are non-zero elements in R[[x]]. Then, they must have some non-zero coefficients. Let's consider the smallest degree terms where they are non-zero. For example, let f have a_m x^m as the first non-zero term and g have b_n x^n as the first non-zero term. Then, the product f*g should have a leading term a_m*b_n x^{m+n}, right? \n\nSince R is an integral domain, the product a_m*b_n cannot be zero because both a_m and b_n are non-zero. Therefore, the product f*g has a non-zero term of degree m + n, so it can't be the zero power series. That seems to be the argument. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned not wanting to expand the product. Maybe they want a more abstract approach. Alternatively, using the property that in an integral domain, the product of non-zero elements is non-zero. \n\nBut R[[x]] is a ring where multiplication is defined by convolution of coefficients. The crucial point is that if R has no zero divisors, then the leading coefficients of non-zero power series multiply to a non-zero element in R, hence the product can't be zero. \n\nSo, to structure the problem according to the given format:\n\nAssumptions need to be listed one by one, each applied to a single object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain,\nR[[x]] is the ring of formal power series over R,\nThe product of two elements in R[[x]] is defined by the Cauchy product.\n\nProblem:\nProve that R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the problem is to show that if the product of two power series is zero, then each must be zero. So maybe the problem statement should be phrased as such.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". So translating that to this problem, the problem would be \"Prove that if the product of two formal power series in R[[x]] is zero, then each series is zero,\" given that R is an integral domain.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line should be the original problem's core. The original question says \"Prove that R[[x]] is an integral domain,\" given that R is an integral domain.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions listing that R is an integral domain, R[[x]] is the ring of formal power series, etc. But each assumption should be a single condition on one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain,\nThe elements of R[[x]] are formal power series with coefficients in R,\nMultiplication in R[[x]] is defined by the Cauchy product.\n\nProblem:\nProve that R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the key assumption is that R is an integral domain. The other points about R[[x]] being formal power series and multiplication defined as Cauchy product are more about definitions rather than assumptions. But according to the example, perhaps all necessary conditions should be listed as assumptions, even if they are definitions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is already assuming that R is an integral domain, and the task is to prove R[[x]] is. So the main assumption is R is an integral domain, and the others are part of the problem's setup.\n\nBut following the example given, the assumptions in the example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In the original problem here, the user mentions that R is an integral domain, and R[[x]] is the ring of formal power series. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain,\nR[[x]] is the ring of formal power series over R,\nMultiplication in R[[x]] is defined by the Cauchy product.\n\nProblem:\nProve that R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's original question is \"If R is an integral domain, then R[[x]] is an integral domain,\" so the assumption is R is an integral domain, and the problem is to prove R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line is the actual statement to prove. So perhaps the assumptions are R is an integral domain, and the problem is to prove R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nBut in the example, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the original problem here, the setup is that R is an integral domain, and the problem is to prove R[[x]] is an integral domain. So perhaps the only assumption is R is an integral domain, and the problem is to prove R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nAlternatively, the original problem might have more hidden assumptions. For instance, R[[x]] being defined as formal power series with coefficients in R. But maybe that's part of the problem's context rather than an assumption.\n\nHmm, the user's example included assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the user states \"If R is an integral domain, then R[[x]] is an integral domain\". So the key assumption is R is an integral domain. The rest is part of the problem's structure.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain.\n\nProblem:\nProve that R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nBut maybe to clarify, the assumption could include that R[[x]] is the ring of formal power series. However, according to the example, assumptions are properties or conditions applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain,\nR[[x]] is the ring of formal power series over R.\n\nBut perhaps \"R[[x]] is the ring of formal power series over R\" is part of the problem statement. Wait, the original problem says \"If R is an integral domain, then R[[x]] is an integral domain\", where R[[x]] is the ring of formal power series. So maybe the only assumption is R is an integral domain, and the problem is to prove R[[x]] is an integral domain. The fact that R[[x]] is the formal power series ring is part of the problem's context.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The original problem in that example had A(n) defined with 5^n and 6^n terms, so the assumptions were n being integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the only assumption is \"R is an integral domain\".\n\nBut the problem is to prove that R[[x]] is an integral domain. The definition of R[[x]] is part of the problem's setup, not an assumption. So maybe the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the ring of formal power series R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem's original title is part of the problem statement, then the problem is \"If R is an integral domain, then R[[x]] is an integral domain\", so the assumption is R is an integral domain, and the problem is to prove R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain.\n\nProblem:\nProve that R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nBut to make sure, in the example, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\" but in the formatted problem, the user included n is divisible by 7 as an assumption. Wait, that example might be a mistake. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem has assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps that example is incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Maybe the example is from a different problem where n is supposed to be divisible by 7. But in the original example given, maybe the user made a mistake. But regardless, following the user's instructions, the assumptions should list all conditions applied to the objects in the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the only assumption is R is an integral domain. The rest is part of the problem's statement. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is an integral domain.\n\nProblem:\nProve that R[[x]] is an integral domain.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps the assumption should also mention that R[[x]] is the ring of formal power series. However, since the problem mentions \"R[[x]] is the set of all formal series...\", maybe that is part of the problem's description rather than an assumption. So in the user's question, the problem is given R is an integral domain, prove R[[x]] is an integral domain. So the assumption is just R being an integral domain.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.",
