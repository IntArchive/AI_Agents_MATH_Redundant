    "Content": "If $H$ is a subgroup of the finite group $G$, then how do I show that $n_p(H) \\leq n_p(G)$? Here $n_p(X)$ is the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups in the finite group $X$. Here is my attempt: Suppose the order of $G$ is $n$, the order of $H$ is $m$, then $m$ divides $n$ by Lagrange's theorem. By Sylow's counting theorem $n_p(H) = 1 \\pmod p$ and $n_p(H)$ divides $m$, $n_p(G) =1 \\pmod p$, $n_p(G)$ divides $n$. How do I continue after this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I like this question, and wanted it to have a bit of a longer answer: Surprising This result should be a little surprising. After all the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $H$ can have smaller order, and even though $G$ may have only a few subgroups of order $p^n$, it might have a ton of order $p^{n-1}$. For example, in $G=A_4$, we have only $n_2(G)=1$ Sylow $2$-subgroup, but it has $3$ subgroups of order $2^1$, and so a subgroup $H$ has $n_2(H) \\leq 3$, but that leaves open the possibility of $n_2(H) \\in \\{2,3\\}$ both of which contradict the theorem. There is an analogue of $A_4$ called $G=\\operatorname{AGL}(1,p^2)$ with approximately the same behavior: $n_p(G)=1$ but $G$ has $p+1$ subgroups of order $p$. When one actually looks for a subgroup $H$, one runs into a problem: no single $H$ contains all those subgroups of order $p$ (or even two of them in the $A_4$ and AGL cases) unless it contains an entire Sylow $p$-subgroup (making those smaller $p$-subgroups irrelevant). Proof This idea leads to a simple proof (given by Derek Holt in the comments). We construction a 1-1 function $f$ from $\\operatorname{Syl}_p(H)$ to $\\operatorname{Syl}_p(G)$ where $\\operatorname{Syl}_p(X)$ is the set of Sylow $p$-subgroups of the finite group $X$. Given a Sylow $p$-subgroup $Q$ of $H$, Sylow's containment theorem says that $Q$ (a $p$-subgroup of $G$) is contained in some Sylow $p$-subgroup $f(Q)$ of $G$. If $f(Q_1) = f(Q_2)$, then $Q_1, Q_2 \\leq f(Q_1)$ and $Q_1, Q_2 \\leq H$, so $Q_1, Q_2 \\leq f(Q_1) \\cap H$. However, $f(Q_1) \\cap H$ is a $p$-subgroup of $H$, and a $p$-subgroup of $H$ can only contain at most a single Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$, so $Q_1 = Q_2$. Hence $f$ is a 1-1 function, and $n_p(H) \\leq n_p(G)$. Normal subgroups If $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then in fact $n_p(H)$ divides $n_p(G)$. Hall (1967) calculated $n_p(G) = n_p(H) \\cdot n_p(G/H) \\cdot n_p(T)$ where $T=N_{PH}(P \\cap H)$ for any Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$. (See also this answer of Mikko Korhonen .)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about showing that if H is a subgroup of a finite group G, then the number of Sylow p-subgroups in H is less than or equal to that in G. The user mentioned using Sylow's theorems and Lagrange's theorem but got stuck after that. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Sylow's theorems tell us about the existence and properties of Sylow p-subgroups. Specifically, the number of Sylow p-subgroups in a group, denoted n_p, satisfies two conditions: n_p ≡ 1 mod p and n_p divides the order of the group. But how does that help relate n_p(H) and n_p(G)?\n\nWait, the user already noted that n_p(H) ≡ 1 mod p and divides |H|, and similarly for G. But these conditions alone might not directly lead to the conclusion. Maybe we need a different approach. Let's recall that Sylow subgroups are maximal p-subgroups, and any Sylow p-subgroup of H must be contained in some Sylow p-subgroup of G. Is that right?\n\nYes, because if P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H, then P is a p-subgroup of G, and by Sylow's theorems, P is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup of G. But then, different Sylow p-subgroups of H could be contained in the same Sylow p-subgroup of G. So maybe we can map each Sylow p-subgroup of H to a Sylow p-subgroup of G and show this map is injective? If that's possible, then n_p(H) ≤ n_p(G).\n\nBut how to formalize that? Suppose H has two Sylow p-subgroups P1 and P2. If both are contained in the same Sylow p-subgroup Q of G, then P1 and P2 are both Sylow in H, so they are conjugate in H. But in G, Q being Sylow, they might not be conjugate in G unless Q is normal, which isn't necessarily the case. Wait, but the containment is in Q. If P1 and P2 are both Sylow in H and contained in Q, then they are conjugate in H, which is a subgroup of G. So their conjugacy is within H, but in Q, which is a Sylow of G, maybe they are also conjugate in Q? Not sure. Maybe this line of thought isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, consider the action of H on the set of Sylow p-subgroups of G by conjugation. The Sylow p-subgroups of H are exactly the stabilizers of some Sylow p-subgroups of G under this action? Hmm. Wait, let's think of H acting on Syl_p(G) by conjugation. Each Sylow p-subgroup of H is a subgroup of H, hence of G, and since Sylow p-subgroups are all conjugate in G, maybe H's Sylow subgroups are intersections of H with some Sylow p-subgroups of G. Wait, that's the second Sylow theorem: any two Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate. So if P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H, then P is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup Q of G. Then, since all Sylow p-subgroups of H are conjugate in H, their images under conjugation by elements of H would also be contained in Sylow p-subgroups of G. But since H is a subgroup, conjugation by h ∈ H would map Q to hQh^{-1}, which is another Sylow p-subgroup of G. So maybe each Sylow p-subgroup of H is contained in a unique Sylow p-subgroup of G? Or not necessarily unique, but if two Sylow p-subgroups of H are contained in the same Sylow p-subgroup of G, then they must be conjugate in H. Wait, but if P1 and P2 are both Sylow in H and contained in Q (a Sylow of G), then there exists h ∈ H such that P1 = hP2h^{-1}. But since Q is a subgroup of G, and H is a subgroup, conjugation by h would keep Q invariant only if h normalizes Q. But there's no guarantee that h normalizes Q unless Q is normal in G, which it isn't necessarily. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the number of Sylow p-subgroups in H is equal to the number of conjugates of a Sylow p-subgroup in H, right? Because n_p(H) is the number of Sylow p-subgroups in H, which are all conjugate. Similarly for G. So perhaps the conjugacy in H versus conjugacy in G. Since H is a subgroup, conjugating by elements of H is a subset of conjugating by elements of G. So the conjugacy classes in H are contained within those in G. Thus, if P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H, then its conjugates in H are fewer or equal to its conjugates in G. Hence, n_p(H) ≤ n_p(G).\n\nBut wait, that might not directly hold because a Sylow p-subgroup of H isn't necessarily a Sylow p-subgroup of G. For example, H could have a smaller Sylow p-subgroup. Wait, no. The order of a Sylow p-subgroup of H is the highest power of p dividing |H|, which is less than or equal to the highest power of p dividing |G|, since |H| divides |G|. So a Sylow p-subgroup of H is a p-subgroup of G, but not necessarily a Sylow p-subgroup of G. However, it is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup of G by Sylow's theorem. So each Sylow p-subgroup of H is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup of G. Therefore, we can consider the mapping from Syl_p(H) to Syl_p(G) by mapping each P in Syl_p(H) to some Q in Syl_p(G) such that P ≤ Q. If this mapping is injective, then n_p(H) ≤ n_p(G). But how do we ensure injectivity? Suppose two different Sylow p-subgroups P1 and P2 of H are contained in the same Sylow p-subgroup Q of G. Then P1 and P2 are both Sylow in H and contained in Q. But since they are Sylow in H, they have the same order, which is the maximal p-power dividing |H|. However, in Q, which is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, P1 and P2 are p-subgroups of Q. But Q might have a larger order. Wait, but if H ∩ Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of H, right? Because the order of H ∩ Q is the maximal p-power dividing |H|. Because Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, so |Q| is the maximal p-power dividing |G|, and |H ∩ Q| is the maximal p-power dividing |H|, since |H ∩ Q| divides both |H| and |Q|, hence divides gcd(|H|, |Q|). But since |Q| is the maximal p-power in |G|, and |H| divides |G|, then the maximal p-power dividing |H| is the same as gcd(|H|, |Q|). So H ∩ Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. Therefore, every Sylow p-subgroup of H is of the form H ∩ Q for some Sylow p-subgroup Q of G. Moreover, if Q and Q' are distinct Sylow p-subgroups of G, then H ∩ Q and H ∩ Q' might be different or the same. Wait, but if H ∩ Q and H ∩ Q' are both Sylow p-subgroups of H, then they must be conjugate in H. But if Q and Q' are not conjugate in G, but H ∩ Q and H ∩ Q' are conjugate in H, that could still happen. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept that the number of Sylow p-subgroups in H is equal to the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G that intersect H in a Sylow p-subgroup of H. So each Sylow p-subgroup of H is the intersection of H with some Sylow p-subgroup of G. But since each Sylow p-subgroup of H must lie inside some Sylow p-subgroup of G, and different Sylow p-subgroups of H could lie in different Sylow p-subgroups of G. But if two different Sylow p-subgroups of H lie in the same Sylow p-subgroup of G, then they must be conjugate in H, which would mean they are the same in H's Sylow count, but since they are different, this can't happen. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nSuppose P1 and P2 are two different Sylow p-subgroups of H. They are both contained in some Sylow p-subgroups of G, say Q1 and Q2. If Q1 and Q2 are the same, then both P1 and P2 are Sylow p-subgroups of H contained in Q1. But in Q1, which is a p-group, P1 and P2 are subgroups of Q1 with order equal to the Sylow p-subgroup of H. However, in Q1, all Sylow p-subgroups are Q1 itself, since Q1 is a p-group. Wait, but Q1 is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, so it's a p-group. In a p-group, the only Sylow p-subgroup is the group itself. Therefore, if P1 and P2 are Sylow p-subgroups of H contained in Q1, then they must be subgroups of Q1, but their order is the maximal p-power dividing |H|. However, Q1 has order equal to the maximal p-power dividing |G|. So unless |H| has the same maximal p-power as |G|, which is not necessarily the case, P1 and P2 could be proper subgroups of Q1. But in that case, they could be different Sylow p-subgroups of H inside Q1, but since they are both Sylow in H, they must be conjugate in H. But since they are both contained in Q1, which is a subgroup of G, their conjugacy in H would imply that there exists h ∈ H such that P1 = hP2h^{-1}. But since H is a subgroup of G, and Q1 is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, conjugation by h ∈ H would send P2 to P1 within Q1? Not necessarily, unless h normalizes Q1. But there's no guarantee of that. So this line of reasoning seems shaky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the action of H on the set of Sylow p-subgroups of G by conjugation. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of H is related to the orbits of this action. Each Sylow p-subgroup of H is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup of G, and conjugation by elements of H permutes the Sylow p-subgroups of G. The stabilizer of a Sylow p-subgroup Q of G under this action is the set of h ∈ H such that hQh^{-1} = Q, i.e., the intersection H ∩ N_G(Q). The orbit-stabilizer theorem tells us that the size of the orbit of Q is [H : H ∩ N_G(Q)]. But I'm not sure how this connects to n_p(H).\n\nWait, another approach: Let’s recall that n_p(H) is the number of Sylow p-subgroups in H. Each Sylow p-subgroup of H is a p-subgroup of G, hence contained in some Sylow p-subgroup of G (by Sylow's theorem). Therefore, there is a mapping from Syl_p(H) to Syl_p(G) by sending each P ∈ Syl_p(H) to some Q ∈ Syl_p(G) such that P ≤ Q. If we can show that this mapping is injective, then n_p(H) ≤ n_p(G). To show injectivity, assume that two Sylow p-subgroups P1 and P2 of H are both contained in the same Sylow p-subgroup Q of G. Then P1 and P2 are both Sylow p-subgroups of H and subgroups of Q. But since Q is a p-group, and P1 and P2 are maximal p-subgroups of H, they are also p-subgroups of Q. However, in Q, which is a p-group, all Sylow p-subgroups are Q itself. But that contradicts unless P1 and P2 are equal to Q, which would only happen if |H| has the same p-power as |G|. Otherwise, P1 and P2 are proper subgroups of Q. But since they are Sylow in H, they are conjugate in H. Therefore, if P1 and P2 are contained in Q and are Sylow in H, they must be conjugate by some element of H. But if they are different, this conjugation would imply they are in the same H-conjugacy class, but n_p(H) counts distinct conjugates. Wait, no. n_p(H) is the number of Sylow p-subgroups in H, which are all conjugate. Wait, no. Sylow's third theorem says that all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate. So if P1 and P2 are two Sylow p-subgroups of H, then there exists h ∈ H such that P1 = hP2h^{-1}. Therefore, if both P1 and P2 are contained in Q, then hP2h^{-1} = P1 is also contained in hQh^{-1}. But unless h normalizes Q, hQh^{-1} is another Sylow p-subgroup of G. But we assumed that both P1 and P2 are contained in Q, so h must map Q to itself. Therefore, h ∈ N_G(Q). But h ∈ H, so h ∈ H ∩ N_G(Q). Therefore, if P1 and P2 are both contained in Q and are Sylow in H, then they are conjugate by an element of H ∩ N_G(Q). Therefore, the number of Sylow p-subgroups of H contained in Q is equal to the number of conjugates of P2 in H by elements of H ∩ N_G(Q). But since H ∩ N_G(Q) is a subgroup of H, the number of such conjugates is [H : N_H(P2)], where N_H(P2) is the normalizer of P2 in H. But by Sylow's theorem, n_p(H) = [H : N_H(P2)], which is the same for all Sylow p-subgroups of H. However, if multiple Sylow p-subgroups of H are contained in the same Q, this would imply that the number of Sylow p-subgroups in H is less than or equal to the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G, since each Q can contribute at most [H : N_H(P)] Sylow subgroups of H, but this seems convoluted.\n\nMaybe another angle: Since H is a subgroup of G, any Sylow p-subgroup P of H is a p-subgroup of G. By Sylow's theorem, P is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup Q of G. Now, consider the set Syl_p(H). Each element of Syl_p(H) is contained in at least one element of Syl_p(G). If we can show that each Sylow p-subgroup of G can contain at most one Sylow p-subgroup of H, then the mapping from Syl_p(H) to Syl_p(G) is injective, and hence n_p(H) ≤ n_p(G). But is this true? Suppose Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of G that contains two different Sylow p-subgroups P1 and P2 of H. Then P1 and P2 are both Sylow in H, so they have the same order, which is the maximal p-power dividing |H|. But since Q is a p-group, and P1 and P2 are subgroups of Q, then P1 and P2 are both Sylow p-subgroups of H and subgroups of Q. However, in Q, which is a p-group, any two Sylow p-subgroups must be equal, because in a p-group, the only Sylow p-subgroup is the group itself. Wait, but that's only if the Sylow p-subgroup is of the same p-power. If the Sylow p-subgroup of H has order p^k where p^k divides |H|, then in Q, which has order p^m where p^m is the maximal p-power dividing |G|, if k < m, then P1 and P2 are just subgroups of Q of order p^k. But they could be different. For example, Q could be C_4, and H could have order 2, so Sylow 2-subgroups of H are of order 2, and Q has subgroups of order 2. So different subgroups of Q could be Sylow in H. Therefore, in this case, Q could contain multiple Sylow p-subgroups of H. Therefore, the mapping from Syl_p(H) to Syl_p(G) is not necessarily injective. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Maybe another way: use the formula that relates n_p(H) and n_p(G) through the normalizer. Let’s recall that if P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H, then P is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup Q of G. Then, the number of Sylow p-subgroups of H conjugate to P is [H : N_H(P)]. Similarly, the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G conjugate to Q is [G : N_G(Q)]. But I'm not sure how to connect these.\n\nAlternatively, consider that H acts on Syl_p(G) by conjugation. The orbit-stabilizer theorem gives that the size of each orbit divides |H|. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G is n_p(G), and H permutes them. The number of orbits is the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G fixed by H, but I don’t see the direct connection to n_p(H).\n\nWait, another thought: Let’s use the fact that the Sylow p-subgroups of H are exactly the intersections of H with the Sylow p-subgroups of G, but only when the Sylow p-subgroups of G intersect H in Sylow p-subgroups of H. However, this isn't always true. For example, if G has a Sylow p-subgroup Q, then H ∩ Q is a p-subgroup of H, but not necessarily a Sylow p-subgroup. The order of H ∩ Q is equal to |H|_p, the maximal p-power dividing |H|, only if Q contains a Sylow p-subgroup of H. But that depends on how H is embedded in G.\n\nWait, actually, if Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then H ∩ Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of H if and only if Q contains a Sylow p-subgroup of H. But by Sylow's theorem, every Sylow p-subgroup of H is contained in some Sylow p-subgroup of G. Therefore, the number of Sylow p-subgroups of H is equal to the number of Sylow p-subgroups Q of G such that H ∩ Q is a Sylow p-subgroup of H. Therefore, each Sylow p-subgroup of H corresponds to a unique Sylow p-subgroup of G (the one containing it), but different Sylow p-subgroups of H might correspond to the same Sylow p-subgroup of G. Wait, no. If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of H, then it's contained in some Q ∈ Syl_p(G). But Q might contain multiple Sylow p-subgroups of H. As in the earlier example where G has a Sylow p-subgroup Q of order 4, and H has order 2, then Q contains H as a subgroup, and H has one Sylow p-subgroup (itself), but if H had order 2 and was not contained in Q, but in another Sylow p-subgroup Q', then H ∩ Q might be trivial, but H ∩ Q' would be H itself. So in that case, the number of Sylow p-subgroups of H (which is 1) corresponds to the Sylow p-subgroup Q' of G that contains H. But if H is contained in multiple Sylow p-subgroups of G, which is impossible because Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate and H can only be contained in one if it's normal, but H isn't necessarily normal.\n\nThis seems to be going in circles. Maybe I should look up the standard proof. Oh wait, the user is asking for help, and I need to provide an answer. Let me recall that the standard approach to show n_p(H) ≤ n_p(G) is by using the fact that H acts on Syl_p(G) by conjugation, and then each Sylow p-subgroup of H is contained in exactly one Sylow p-subgroup of G. Therefore, the number of Sylow p-subgroups of H is less than or equal to the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. Alternatively, consider that each Sylow p-subgroup of H is a p-subgroup of G and hence lies in some Sylow p-subgroup of G. If two distinct Sylow p-subgroups of H lie in the same Sylow p-subgroup of G, then they are conjugate in H, which would mean they are not distinct. Therefore, the mapping from Syl_p(H) to Syl_p(G) is injective. Wait, this seems like the key point. Suppose P1 and P2 are two distinct Sylow p-subgroups of H contained in the same Sylow p-subgroup Q of G. Since P1 and P2 are both Sylow in H, they are conjugate in H. Let h ∈ H such that P1 = hP2h^{-1}. But since both are contained in Q, and Q is a subgroup of G, conjugation by h would map Q to hQh^{-1}. However, unless h normalizes Q, this would map Q to another Sylow p-subgroup. But we assumed both P1 and P2 are in Q, so conjugation by h must send P2 (inside Q) to P1 inside Q. Therefore, h must normalize Q. But h ∈ H, so h ∈ N_G(Q) ∩ H. Therefore, P1 and P2 are conjugate in N_G(Q) ∩ H. However, in a p-group Q, the number of Sylow p-subgroups of H contained in Q is equal to the number of conjugates of P2 under N_G(Q) ∩ H. But in Q, a p-group, the Sylow p-subgroups of H are just maximal p-subgroups of H, and they are all conjugate in N_G(Q) ∩ H. Therefore, if Q contains more than one Sylow p-subgroup of H, they must be conjugate in N_G(Q) ∩ H, hence the same. Therefore, each Q can contain at most one Sylow p-subgroup of H. Therefore, the mapping from Syl_p(H) to Syl_p(G) is injective, hence n_p(H) ≤ n_p(G). \n\nWait, that seems to work. So the key idea is that if two Sylow p-subgroups of H are contained in the same Sylow p-subgroup Q of G, then they must be conjugate in H, but since Q is a p-group and they are both subgroups of Q, their conjugacy implies they are the same subgroup, which contradicts their distinctness. Therefore, each Sylow p-subgroup of H is contained in a unique Sylow p-subgroup of G, hence the injection.",
