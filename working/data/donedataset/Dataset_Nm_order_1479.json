    "Content": "I am studying topology, on my own, using a text I found online. I am currently reviewing the “Metrics” section that reminds me of the real analysis course I took over 10 years ago. The text ask me to “show” the following: Suppose M is a metric space. Show that an open ball in M is an open subset, and a closed ball in M is a closed subset. I have what I think is a counterexample to the second part. First, let me state the definitions as they are written in the book I am using: For any $x \\in M$ and $r>0$, the (open) ball of radius r around x is the set $$ B_r(x)=\\{y \\in M: d(x,y)<r \\}, $$ and the closed ball of radius r around x is\n  $$ \\overline B_r(x)=\\{y \\in M: d(x,y) \\leq r \\}, $$ A subset $A \\subseteq M $ is said to be an open subset of M if it contains an open ball around each of its points. A subset $A \\subseteq M $ is said to be an closed subset of M if M\\A is open. I believe the following is a counterexample to this: Let $$M = [1,10].$$ Now $ \\overline B_1(5)=\\{y \\in M: d(5,y) \\leq 1 \\} $ is a closed ball. More simply put, $ \\overline B_1(5)=[4,6] $. Lets call the closed ball $A$. $$ A=\\overline B_1(5)=[4,6]$$\n  Clearly, $A \\subseteq M $, and $ M-A = [1,4)  \\cup  (6,10] $. However $M-A$ is not open because $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{10\\}$ cannot have open balls around them without going beyond M. Is there an error in the text, or an error in my thinking?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your intuition is good in that $[1,4)$ and $(6,10]$ are not open in $\\mathbb R$. However, they are open in $M=[1,10]$ - that is, openness is a property relative to the metric space. In fact, consider the definition of an open ball of radius $3$ around $1$ in $M$:\n$$B_3(1)=\\{y\\in M:|y-1|<3\\}$$\nthe condition $y\\in M$ means that $y$ must be in $[1,10]$ and the condition $|y-1|<3$ implies that $y$ cannot be $4$ or more - thus $B_3(1)=[1,4)$. Essentially, when we're working in a subspace of a metric space, we can \"chop off\" open sets like this. That is, we have that $(-2,4)$ was an open ball, and when we're in the metric space on $[1,10]$ we take their intersection to get $[1,4)$ being open in the subspace. We do not have to worry about the exclusion of points which are not in the space.",

In the metric space $M = [1,10]$, open sets are intersections of open sets in $\\mathbb{R}$ with $M$. For example:  \n- In $M$, an open ball around $1$ is $[1,1+r)$ for $r > 0$, which is valid in $M$.  \n- Similarly, an open ball around $10$ is $(10-r,10]$.  \n\nThe complement $M \\setminus \\overline{B}_1(5) = [1,4) \\cup (6,10]$ **is open in $M$** because:  \n- Every point $y \\in [1,4)$ has an open ball in $M$ contained in $[1,4)$ (e.g., for $y=3.5$, $B_{0.5}(3.5) = (3,4) \\subset [1,4)$).  \n- Every point $y \\in (6,10]$ has an open ball in $M$ contained in $(6,10]$.  \n\nThus, $\\overline{B}_1(5)$ is closed in $M$, and the original statement holds. The counterexample fails because it incorrectly assumes openness is defined relative to $\\mathbb{R}$ instead of $M$.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user is questioning whether a closed ball in a metric space is always a closed subset. They provided a counterexample where the metric space M is the interval [1,10], and the closed ball around 5 with radius 1 is [4,6]. They argue that the complement of this closed ball in M, which is [1,4) ∪ (6,10], isn't open because points 1 and 10 can't have open balls around them without going outside M. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A subset is closed if its complement is open. A set is open if every point in it has an open ball entirely contained within the set. In the example, M is [1,10], so it's a metric space under the standard Euclidean metric. The closed ball A is [4,6], so the complement M - A is [1,4) ∪ (6,10]. The user is correct that in the larger space of real numbers, [1,4) and (6,10] aren't open because 1 and 10 are limit points not included in the set. But wait, in the subspace topology of M, open sets are intersections of open sets in the real numbers with M. So, in M, an open ball around 1 would be [1,1 + r) for some r > 0. Similarly, around 10, it would be (10 - r,10]. So, in the subspace M, the complement [1,4) ∪ (6,10] should be open because each point in [1,4) can have an open ball in M that stays within [1,4), and similarly for (6,10]. For example, for point 1 in M, the open ball B_r(1) in M would be [1,1 + r). Since 1 is included in M, this interval is entirely within [1,4) as long as r < 3. Similarly, at 4 in the complement (which is actually not in the complement; wait, the complement is [1,4) and (6,10]. So, points in [1,4) can have open balls in M that are within [1,4). For example, take a point like 3.5. In M, an open ball around 3.5 with radius 0.5 would be (3,4), which is entirely within [1,4). Similarly, at point 1, an open ball of radius 0.5 would be [1,1.5), which is in [1,4). Therefore, the complement is indeed open in M. So the user's mistake might be thinking that {1} and {10} can't have open balls, but in the subspace M, those points can have open balls that are half-open intervals, which are valid in the subspace topology. Hence, the complement is open, so A is closed. Therefore, the user's counterexample is incorrect because they didn't account for the subspace topology. The original statement that closed balls are closed subsets holds true even in this case.",
