    "Content": "I have a Sobolev space related question. In the book 'Measure theory and fine properties of functions' by Lawrence Evans and Ronald Gariepy. I know the result that states that for $f: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ . $f$ is locally Lipschitz in $\\Omega$ if and only if $f \\in W^{1,\\infty}_{loc}(\\Omega)$ . I recently saw that it was stated in a book 'Nonlinear partial differential equations with applications' by Roubicek, that $W^{1,\\infty}(\\Omega) = C^{0,1}(\\Omega)$ . Can anyone confirm this stronger result and maybe recommend a book or text which provides a proof? Thanks a lot for any help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "\"Locally\" is ambiguous here $f$ is locally Lipschitz in $\\Omega$ if and only if $f \\in W^{1,\\infty}_{loc}(\\Omega)$ The validity of this claim depends on interpretation of \"locally Lipschitz\". Does it mean every point of $\\Omega$ has a neighborhood in which $f$ is Lipschitz, or there is $L$ such that every point of $\\Omega$ has a neighborhood in which $f$ is $L$ -Lipschitz (i.e., satisfies $|f(x)-f(y)|\\le L|x-y|$ ). With interpretation 1) the above would be false, because $f(x)=1/x$ is locally Lipschitz on the interval $(0,1)$ . The authors meant interpretation 2, but you should be aware that it may be less common. Saying \"locally $L$ -Lipschitz\" would be more precise. Counterexample and quasiconvexity $W^{1,\\infty}(\\Omega) = C^{0,1}(\\Omega)$ This is not always true. For example, let $\\Omega$ be the plane with the slit along negative $x$ -axis. Using polar coordinates $r,\\theta$ , with $-\\pi<\\theta<\\pi$ , define $u(r,\\theta) = r\\theta$ . You can check that this is a $W^{1,\\infty}$ function (it is locally $10$ -Lipschitz, say), but it is not in $C^{0,1}(\\Omega)$ because the values of $f$ just above the slit and just below it are far apart. The counterexample is taken from here , where you can also find a result in the positive direction; for sufficiently nice $\\Omega$ the equality holds. Also, see the answer and references in relation between $W^{1,\\infty}$ and $C^{0,1}$ . Vanishing on the boundary The definition of $W^{1,\\infty}_0(\\Omega)$ is a bit tricky since the usual approach (complete the space of smooth compactly supported functions with respect to the Sobolev norm) does not apply. Instead one can define $W_0^{1,\\infty}(\\Omega)$ as follows. Every element of $W^{1,\\infty}(\\Omega)$ has a continuous representative $u$ . If $u$ satisfies $\\lim_{x\\to a}u(x)= 0$ for  every $a\\in \\partial \\Omega$ , then we say that $u\\in  W_0^{1,\\infty}(\\Omega)$ . This is a closed subspace, because convergence in $W^{1,\\infty}$ norm implies uniform convergence. As an aside: one can give a unified definition of $W^{1,p}_0(\\Omega)$ that works for all $1\\le p\\le \\infty$ : a function is in $W^{1,p}_0(\\Omega)$ if its zero extension to $\\mathbb R^n$ is in $W^{1,p}(\\mathbb R^n)$ . For every domain, $W_0^{1,\\infty}(\\Omega)$ is the same as the set of Lipschitz functions on $\\Omega$ that tend to $0$ at the boundary. Indeed, we can extend  by zero to the rest of $\\mathbb R^n$ and use the fact that $\\mathbb R^n$ is convex.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem based on the user's example. First, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about the relation between Sobolev Space W^{1,∞} and the Lipschitz class. They mention two books: Evans and Gariepy state that locally Lipschitz functions are equivalent to W^{1,∞}_{loc}, while Roubicek claims W^{1,∞}(Ω) = C^{0,1}(Ω). The user wants confirmation of this stronger result and a reference for the proof.\n\nNow, I need to filter out the unnecessary information. The original question includes mentions of specific books and authors, which might not be essential for stating the problem. Also, the request for a book recommendation is part of the question but not the mathematical problem itself. The core mathematical problem is whether W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω), i.e., the space of Lipschitz continuous functions.\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the domain Ω is important. Typically, Sobolev spaces require some regularity on the domain. But in the user's example, the assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7 was listed. However, in this problem, the question is about the equivalence of two function spaces. The key assumptions would relate to the domain Ω (maybe being open or having Lipschitz boundary?) and the functions considered (like f: Ω → ℝ).\n\nWait, in Evans and Gariepy, it's for locally Lipschitz and W^{1,∞}_{loc}, whereas Roubicek states the global version. So perhaps the assumptions are on the domain Ω being such that the global Sobolev space coincides with the Lipschitz space. But the user's problem as stated by Roubicek is W^{1,∞}(Ω) = C^{0,1}(Ω). So the assumptions might be that Ω is a domain where this equality holds. However, typically, this holds when Ω is a Lipschitz domain or maybe convex. But since the user is asking to confirm this result, perhaps the key assumption is that Ω is a sufficiently nice domain (like open with Lipschitz boundary) and the functions are in W^{1,∞}(Ω) which implies they are Lipschitz continuous, and vice versa.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were on n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about equivalence of two function spaces, so perhaps the assumptions are on the domain Ω. However, the user's problem as stated by Roubicek is presented as an equality without qualifying the domain. So maybe the problem is under the assumption that Ω is a convex domain or a domain with Lipschitz boundary.\n\nBut the original question from the user doesn't specify any particular conditions on Ω, except that in Evans and Gariepy, it's local (W^{1,∞}_{loc}) and Roubicek states the global version. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, perhaps the key assumptions are about the properties of Ω that allow the global equivalence. However, since the user is asking for confirmation of the equality W^{1,∞}(Ω) = C^{0,1}(Ω), maybe the standard assumptions are that Ω is a convex domain or a domain with Lipschitz boundary. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we need to state the problem without domain assumptions, which may not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes Ω is an open subset of ℝ^n with Lipschitz boundary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is stated for general domains, and the user is confused about whether the equality holds globally. However, in Evans and Gariepy, the local result holds for any open set Ω, but the global result requires Ω to have certain properties. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem would be that Ω is an open subset of ℝ^n with Lipschitz boundary, or convex, but since the user didn't specify, maybe we should list the necessary assumptions for the equality to hold.\n\nBut looking at the example, the user's formatted problem included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's original conditions. However, in the current problem, the original question doesn't specify the domain's properties. So perhaps the answer should list the assumptions required for the equality W^{1,∞}(Ω) = C^{0,1}(Ω) to hold. But since the user is asking about the result as stated by Roubicek, maybe the problem is presented under the assumption that Ω is a domain where this equality is valid. However, since the user is seeking confirmation of the result, perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show the equivalence under the assumption that Ω is a convex domain or a domain with Lipschitz boundary, which are common conditions for such Sobolev space characterizations. But since the original question doesn't specify, the formatted problem should capture the problem as stated in the user's question, which is whether W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω) (the space of Lipschitz functions), and the assumptions would be the necessary conditions on Ω and the functions involved.\n\nBut the user's example included specific assumptions on the variable n. Here, the problem is about function spaces. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Ω is an open subset of ℝ^n.\n- Ω has a Lipschitz boundary (or is convex).\n- Functions in W^{1,∞}(Ω) have weak derivatives that are essentially bounded.\n- Functions in C^{0,1}(Ω) are Lipschitz continuous with the Lipschitz constant equal to the essential supremum of the gradient.\n\nBut the user's example lists assumptions per line, each addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is a convex domain in ℝ^n,\nf: Ω → ℝ is a function,\nf belongs to W^{1,∞}(Ω),\nf is Lipschitz continuous on Ω.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω). The original question mentions that Evans and Gariepy show the local version, and Roubicek states the global version. Therefore, the key assumption here might be that Ω is a convex domain or a domain with Lipschitz boundary, which allows the global equivalence.\n\nHowever, since the user's formatted example extracted explicit conditions from the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7), here the explicit conditions might be on the domain Ω. But since the original question doesn't specify, perhaps the problem is stated for a general domain Ω, and the assumptions required for the equality are part of the problem's answer.\n\nWait, but the user wants to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. The problem is to confirm that W^{1,∞}(Ω) = C^{0,1}(Ω), and the assumptions would be the conditions under which this holds. However, the original problem as posed by the user doesn't specify the domain's properties; they just saw it in a book. So perhaps the assumption is that Ω is a domain where this equality holds, but that's circular. Alternatively, maybe the problem is stated under the assumption that Ω is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary.\n\nBut without more information from the user, maybe the problem is as stated by Roubicek, so the assumptions are inherent. The formatted problem should reflect the problem as posed, which is the equality between W^{1,∞}(Ω) and C^{0,1}(Ω). So the assumptions might be that Ω is a sufficiently regular domain (like Lipschitz), but since the user didn't specify, perhaps the problem is presented without domain assumptions, and the answer would clarify the necessary conditions. However, in the example, the user included specific assumptions from the problem. So in this case, perhaps the problem is to prove the equality under the standard assumptions, which would be part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem mentions \"for f: Ω → ℝ\" and the books' results, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- Ω is an open subset of ℝ^n,\n- Ω has the Lipschitz property,\n- Functions are considered in the Sobolev space W^{1,∞}(Ω),\n- Functions are considered in the Lipschitz space C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line. Each line addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is an open subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ has a Lipschitz boundary,\nf: Ω → ℝ,\nf is an element of W^{1,∞}(Ω),\nf is an element of C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nBut the problem is to show the equality of the spaces, so perhaps the assumptions are about the domain's properties. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is an open convex subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ is bounded.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require additional assumptions beyond Ω being an open set, but in that case, the equality may not hold. So probably, the problem's assumptions include that Ω is a domain with Lipschitz boundary, which is a common condition for such equivalences.\n\nGiven that, the formatted problem would have assumptions on Ω, and the problem is to prove the equality of the spaces. But the user's example lists explicit assumptions from the problem. In the original problem, the user didn't specify any domain conditions, but the answer would require them. Since the user's task is to structure the problem as per the example, which in the case of the divisibility by 91 problem included assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the assumptions would relate to Ω and the function spaces.\n\nBut the original problem as stated by the user is: \"W^{1,∞}(Ω) = C^{0,1}(Ω)\". The question is to confirm this. Therefore, the problem is to show that these two spaces are equal, and the assumptions are the conditions under which this holds. However, since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the formatted problem lists the necessary assumptions for the equality to hold.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were explicit in the original problem (n is an integer, divisible by 7). Here, the original problem doesn't state the domain's properties, so perhaps the formatted problem assumes Ω is a suitable domain (like convex or Lipschitz) and lists that as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, since in Evans and Gariepy, the result is local (W^{1,∞}_{loc} equals locally Lipschitz), and Roubicek claims the global version, the key difference is the domain. So perhaps the assumption is that Ω is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary.\n\nBut since the user's formatted example included two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), each on one line. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is a bounded open subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ has a Lipschitz boundary,\nf: Ω → ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) = C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is an open subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ has a Lipschitz boundary,\nf is a function from Ω to ℝ,\nf belongs to W^{1,∞}(Ω),\nf belongs to C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nBut the problem is to show the equality of the spaces, which would involve showing each inclusion. However, the user's example didn't include function assumptions but rather the variables' properties. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were about n: being an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the assumptions would be about the domain Ω and possibly the functions. But since the problem is about the equality of two spaces, the assumptions are likely on the domain Ω.\n\nBut the user is asking to confirm that W^{1,∞}(Ω) = C^{0,1}(Ω), so the formatted problem would list assumptions required for this equality. Common conditions for such results are that Ω is a convex domain or a domain with Lipschitz boundary. So:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is a convex subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ is open.\n\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nAlternatively, if Lipschitz boundary is required:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is an open subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ has a Lipschitz boundary.\n\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nBut I need to check standard references. Evans and Gariepy's result is local, while the global version requires regularity on the domain. For instance, in convex domains, functions in W^{1,∞}(Ω) are Lipschitz. So the equality holds if Ω is convex. Similarly, domains with Lipschitz boundary also allow for extension operators, which might be necessary for the global result.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should include assumptions about Ω being convex or having a Lipschitz boundary. However, since the user's example didn't include the domain's properties but rather the variable's, perhaps here the problem's assumptions are inherent in the function spaces. But the user's example shows that assumptions can be about variables, so here the domain's properties are the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is a convex open subset of ℝ^n,\nf: Ω → ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nBut to be precise, the equality between W^{1,∞}(Ω) and C^{0,1}(Ω) holds when Ω is convex or more generally a domain with the extension property. Alternatively, when Ω is quasiconvex. However, for simplicity, assuming convexity is common.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is that for any open set Ω, W^{1,∞}(Ω) consists of functions that are locally Lipschitz, and if Ω is also quasiconvex, then locally Lipschitz implies Lipschitz. But I think the precise conditions may vary.\n\nGiven that the user mentioned Roubicek's book states the equality without specifying domain conditions, perhaps the problem is presented under the general assumption that Ω is a domain where such equality holds, but in reality, additional conditions are needed. However, without more context, the formatted problem would need to reflect the original question's content, which mentions the two books and their statements.\n\nIn the original problem, the user is confused because Evans and Gariepy have a local result, while Roubicek states a global one. Therefore, the problem is to confirm that under what conditions does W^{1,∞}(Ω) equal C^{0,1}(Ω). The assumptions would then be the conditions required for the global equality, such as Ω being convex or with Lipschitz boundary.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would list those domain assumptions and then pose the problem to prove the equality. However, since the user's example had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), here, the assumptions could be:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is an open subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ is convex,\nf: Ω → ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nAlternatively, if the domain needs to have a Lipschitz boundary:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is an open subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ has a Lipschitz boundary.\n\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nBut since the user's original question doesn't specify the domain's properties, it's possible that the answer requires such assumptions, but the problem as posed by the user may not include them. Hence, to follow the example, which extracted the assumptions from the original problem (even though in the divisibility problem, the user had to include an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't explicitly stated but necessary for the conclusion), here we might need to infer the necessary assumptions.\n\nBut in the original divisibility problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, that seems contradictory. Wait, checking the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. But perhaps the example is wrong? Wait, no, perhaps in the original problem, the user intended to have n divisible by 7, but the example seems to have a mistake. However, the user provided that example, so I have to follow it. Thus, perhaps the assistant in that case extracted assumptions that weren't explicitly stated but were necessary. But that seems like a error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the example corrected it. Anyway, following the user's example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in this current problem, even though the original question doesn't specify domain conditions, the formatted problem should include the necessary assumptions for the equality to hold, such as Ω being convex.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is a convex open subset of ℝ^n,\nf: Ω → ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nAlternatively, if we take Ω to have a Lipschitz boundary:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is an open subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ has a Lipschitz boundary.\n\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nBut since the user's original problem cites Roubicek's book stating the equality without qualifying the domain, perhaps the problem is presented under general assumptions, and the answer would clarify that additional domain regularity is needed. However, according to the user's example, assumptions are extracted from the problem. In the divisibility problem, even though the original said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. So perhaps in that example, there was a mistake, but following it, here we need to list assumptions that are necessary for the problem.\n\nBut since the original problem (from the user's question) is about confirming the equality W^{1,∞}(Ω) = C^{0,1}(Ω), the key assumptions are the properties of Ω that allow this equality. Therefore, the formatted problem should include those domain properties as assumptions.\n\nGiven that, and considering common mathematical knowledge that this equality holds for convex domains or domains with Lipschitz boundary, the formatted problem would include:\n\nAssumption:\nΩ is a convex open subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ is bounded.\n\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps boundedness is not required. The critical assumption is convexity. For example, in Leoni's \"A First Course in Sobolev Spaces\", it's mentioned that for convex domains, W^{1,p}(Ω) functions can be characterized by global properties. Specifically, for W^{1,∞}(Ω), functions are Lipschitz continuous on convex domains.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should assume Ω is convex and open.\n\nThus, the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nΩ is an open subset of ℝ^n,\nΩ is convex,\nf: Ω → ℝ.\nProblem:\nProve that W^{1,∞}(Ω) equals C^{0,1}(Ω).",
