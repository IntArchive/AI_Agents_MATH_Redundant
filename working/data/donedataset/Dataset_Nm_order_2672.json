    "Content": "We were given a challenge by our calculus professor and I've been stuck on it for a while now. Show that the set of subsequence limits of $A_n=\\sin(n)$ is $[-1, 1]$ (another way to phrase this would be: $\\forall r\\in [-1,1]$ there exists a subsequence of $A_n=\\sin(n)$ that converges to $r$). What would be a good way to start?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Following Qiaochu hint, I'll try to elaborate a bit. Note: This is a complete rewrite of the proof to fix a flaw pointed out by Qiaochu and make it overall clearer. First some notation. Let $S^1 = [0, 2\\pi)$ with 0 and $2\\pi$ identified. For two points $a, b \\in S^1$ we'll denote by $a \\oplus b = a + b \\mod 2\\pi$ (and likewise for $\\ominus$) and let $A_n = \\{n \\mod 2\\pi\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$. Also denote by $U_{\\varepsilon}(p)$ a punctured $\\varepsilon$-neighborhood of $p \\in S^1$. Our strategy will be to show that $\\{A_n\\}$ has at least one limit point in $S^1$. From this we will conclude that 0 is also a limit point and finally we will use this fact to show that every point in $S_1$ is a limit point of $A_n$ (this means that $\\{A_n\\}$ is dense in S^1). Having established this, we will use continuity of $\\sin$ to finally resolve the problem. Proof As a preparation we will note the relation $A_{n+m} = A_n \\oplus A_m \\quad (1)$. As a corollary of this we have that the sequence $\\{A_n\\}$ is injective (for if not, there would exist $n, m \\in \\mathbb{N}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\quad n>m$  such that $A_n = A_m$ and so $n - m = 2 k \\pi$, a contradiction with irrationality of $\\pi$). This implies simple but crucial fact that the image of the sequence contains infinitely many points. Now, to establish the density of ${A_n}$ in $S^1$ we will first show that there exists at least one limit point $p \\in S^1$. This is established by a standard argument: consider intervals $I = [0, \\pi]$ and $J = [\\pi, 2\\pi]$ and take the one which contains infinitely many points of $\\{A_n\\}$ (if both do, take the \"bottom\" one, i.e. $I$). Call this interval $I_0$. Now again divide it in two intervals of same length and let $I_1$ be the one with infinitely many points. Continue in this way to obtain an infinite sequance of intervals $I_0 \\supset I_1 \\supset \\cdots$. Then the set  $K = \\cap_{n=0}^{\\infty} I_n$ is non-empty (this should be covered in standard calculus course, I hope) and any point $p \\in K$ is surely a limit point (by construction of $\\{I_n\\}$). Thanks to the above we now know that for each $\\varepsilon > 0$ there exist infinitely many points in $U_\\varepsilon(p)$, i.e. infinitely many $n, m \\quad n > m$ such that $|A_n - A_m - 2k\\pi| < 2\\varepsilon$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. But from (1) we get that $|A_{n-m} - 2k\\pi| < 2\\varepsilon$. Because we identify 0 and $2\\pi$ in $S^1$ we can see that these differences are concentrated around 0. Therefore we have shown that 0 is also a limit point. Now we will show that every $p \\in S^1$ is a limit point. Suppose we are given $\\varepsilon > 0$. We just take any $A_k$ from $U_{\\varepsilon}(0)$ and note that for $l = \\lfloor {p \\over A_k} \\rfloor$ we have $A_{lk} \\in U_{\\varepsilon}(p)$. To conclude the answer we will show that any $r \\in [-1, 1]$ is indeed a limit point of $\\{\\sin(n)\\}$. Take $s = \\arcsin (r) \\mod 2\\pi$. Then by the above, we know that $s$ is a limit point of $\\{A_n\\}$ so there is a subsequence $\\{A_{n_k}\\} \\to s$ and observe by continuity of $\\sin$ that $\\{\\sin(A_{n_k})\\} = \\{\\sin(n_k)\\} \\to sin(s) = r$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is to show that the set of subsequence limits of A_n = sin(n) is the entire interval [-1, 1]. In other words, for every real number r between -1 and 1, there exists a subsequence of sin(n) that converges to r. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some relevant mathematical concepts. The problem involves subsequential limits of the sequence sin(n), where n is a positive integer. Subsequential limits are the limits of convergent subsequences of the original sequence. The set of all such limits is called the limit set. To show that this set is [-1, 1], I need to prove two things: \n\n1. Every subsequential limit lies within [-1, 1]. \n2. Every point in [-1, 1] is a subsequential limit.\n\nThe first part is straightforward because the sine function is bounded between -1 and 1. Therefore, every term of the sequence sin(n) is in [-1, 1], and any limit of a subsequence must also lie within this interval. So part 1 is done.\n\nThe challenging part is part 2: showing that every r in [-1, 1] is the limit of some subsequence of sin(n). To approach this, I need to think about the density of the sequence sin(n) in the interval [-1, 1]. If the sequence is dense in this interval, then every point in [-1, 1] is a limit of some subsequence. \n\nBut how do we show that sin(n) is dense in [-1, 1]? This relates to the distribution of the angles n radians on the unit circle. Since n is an integer, we're essentially looking at the points on the unit circle at angles 1, 2, 3, ... radians, measured from the positive x-axis. The key idea here is that the sequence of angles n radians modulo 2π is dense in the interval [0, 2π). If that's the case, then their sine values would be dense in [-1, 1].\n\nSo, the problem reduces to showing that the sequence {n mod 2π} is dense in [0, 2π). To establish density, we can use results from number theory, particularly related to equidistribution. A fundamental result is that if α is irrational, then the sequence {nα} (mod 1) is dense in [0, 1). Here, α is 1/(2π), which is irrational because π is transcendental, hence 1/(2π) is irrational. However, the density of {n/(2π)} mod 1 in [0,1) would imply that {n} mod 2π is dense in [0, 2π). \n\nWait, let me check that. If we have α irrational, then the fractional parts {nα} are dense in [0,1). In our case, if we take α = 1/(2π), which is irrational, then the fractional parts {n/(2π)} are dense in [0,1). Multiplying by 2π, this would mean that the sequence {n/(2π)} * 2π = {n} mod 2π is dense in [0, 2π). Therefore, the angles n mod 2π are dense in [0, 2π). \n\nTherefore, for any θ in [0, 2π), there exists a subsequence n_k such that n_k mod 2π approaches θ. Then, sin(n_k) = sin(θ) would approach sin(θ). Since θ can be any angle in [0, 2π), sin(θ) can take any value in [-1, 1]. Hence, for any r in [-1,1], we can find a θ such that sin(θ) = r, and then find a subsequence n_k such that n_k mod 2π approaches θ, making sin(n_k) approach sin(θ) = r. \n\nTherefore, the key step is the density of {n mod 2π} in [0, 2π), which follows from the equidistribution theorem because 1/(2π) is irrational. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects a more elementary approach without invoking equidistribution directly. Let's think about how to show density without the full force of equidistribution. \n\nOne way to approach density is to show that the sequence {n mod 2π} does not repeat periodically and gets arbitrarily close to any point in [0, 2π). Since 1/(2π) is irrational, the sequence n/(2π) mod 1 is dense in [0,1), which is the same as saying n mod 2π is dense in [0, 2π). This is a consequence of Kronecker's theorem, which states that if α is irrational, then the sequence {nα} is dense in [0,1). \n\nSo, given that 1/(2π) is irrational, Kronecker's theorem applies, and thus {n mod 2π} is dense. Therefore, sin(n) is dense in [-1,1], implying that every r in [-1,1] is a subsequential limit. \n\nBut perhaps we need to verify that 1/(2π) is indeed irrational. Since π is transcendental, it's irrational, and so 2π is also irrational. Therefore, 1/(2π) is irrational. \n\nAlternatively, if we take the angle increments as 1 radian, which is not a rational multiple of π. Since π is irrational, adding 1 radian each time doesn't cycle periodically, leading to the density. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the integers under addition modulo 2π form a dense subgroup of the real numbers modulo 2π if and only if the step size (1 radian) is incommensurate with 2π, which it is because 1 and 2π are not rationally related. \n\nTherefore, by the density argument, the sequence sin(n) will get arbitrarily close to any value in [-1,1], hence the set of subsequential limits is [-1,1]. \n\nTo structure this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The function considered is A_n = sin(n).\n- The problem requires considering all possible subsequential limits of A_n.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of subsequence limits of A_n = sin(n) is the interval [-1, 1].",
