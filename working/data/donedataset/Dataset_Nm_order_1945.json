    "Content": "I'm having trouble solving the following exercise in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology(1.3 #5): \"Let $X$ be the subspace of $R^2$ consisting of the four sides of the square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ together with the segments of the vertical lines $x=\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{4},\\ldots$ inside the square. Show that for every covering space $\\tilde{X}\\to X$ there is some neighbourhood of the left edge of $X$ that lifts homeomorphically to $\\tilde{X}$. Deduce that $X$ has no simply-connected cover.\" I tried piecing together open sets in $\\tilde{X}$ which were homeomorphic to open square shaped $\\epsilon$-neighbourhoods of points in the left edge of $X$, but I couldn't glue them together coherently. My second idea was to use the path lifting property to lift the left edge, but I couldn't extend it to a lift of an open neighbourhood of the left edge. Edit : Some more detail on my first attempt: Suppose I have two open squares $U_1$ and $U_2$ in $X$ (containing the left edge) with nonempty intersection, and that have preimages $\\coprod_i U_{1,i}$ and $\\coprod_j U_{2,j}$ with each piece of that mapping homeomorphically onto $U_1$ and $U_2$ respectively. Suppose I've chosen a specific $U_{1,i}$, and I want to choose a specific $U_{2,j}$ so that their union maps homeomorphically to $U_1$ union $U_2$. Such a choice can be specified by a point in the chosen $U_{1,i}$ that maps into $U_2$, but for each such point, there could be a different choice of $j$. My intution tells me that to make this choice, one needs to appeal to the bad local nature of the left edge of $X$, (so that you're certain to get some of the vertical lines inside of the desired open set) but I'm not sure how to proceed with that.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I believe that I found an answer to my problem. The earlier approach of playing with open covers didn't pan out because I couldn't extend local injectivity of $p$ on a bunch of open sets to injectivity on their union. But I found the following theorem, which solves the problem quite neatly. I found it in [1], along with a sketch proof. (But I'll prove it fully): Theorem: Let $E$ be any space and $F$ be a metric space. Let $K\\subset E$ be compact, $f:E\\to F$ be continuous, locally injective near every point $p\\in K$ , and (globally) injective on $K$ . Then $f$ is also injective on some open neighbourhood $N$ of $K$ . Proof: Let $g:E\\times E\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the function defined by $g(x,x')=d(f(x),f(x'))$ . Around each point of the form $(k,k)\\in K\\times K$ , there is an open product neighbourhood $V_k \\times V_k$ such that $(V_k\\times V_k)\\cap g^{-1}(0) \\subset \\{ (x,x)\\in E\\times E \\}$ (by local injectivity). Let $V=\\cup_k \\left(V_k\\times V_k\\right)$ . Then the compact set $K\\times K$ is contained in\nthe open set $g^{-1}(0)^c \\cup V$ . By the generalized tube lemma, there are open sets $W,W'$ of $E$ so that $K\\times K\\subset W\\times W'\\subset g^{-1}(0)^c \\cup V$ . Then let $N=W\\cap W'$ . $\\square$ Applying this theorem to $p:\\tilde{X} \\to X$ , with $K$ being a lift of the left edge of $X$ , gives an open neighbourhood of that lift which maps homeomorphically to an open\nneighbourhood of the left edge of $X$ . Then we use the bad local nature of $X$ to find a\nloop in $X$ which lifts to a loop in $\\tilde{X}$ which is not contractible. (Compactness is used again to find an open set which contains the entirety of a vertical line) [1] Wagner,M., \"Existence of schlicht integral manifolds for ordinary differential equations\", Archiv der Mathematik, Volume 61, Number 6, 529-542 (1993)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about Hatcher's Algebraic Topology exercise 1.3 #5. The goal is to show that for every covering space of the given space X, there's a neighborhood of the left edge that lifts homeomorphically, and then deduce that X has no simply-connected cover.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The space X is described as the subspace of R² consisting of the four sides of the square [0,1]×[0,1] along with the vertical segments x=1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc., inside the square. So, X is the boundary of the square plus those vertical lines. That's the main structure.\n\nThe problem has two parts: first, show that every covering space has a neighborhood of the left edge (which is the left side of the square, x=0 from y=0 to y=1) that lifts homeomorphically. Then, use this to conclude that there's no simply-connected covering space for X.\n\nThe user tried using open sets in the cover that are homeomorphic to epsilon neighborhoods around points on the left edge but couldn't glue them. Then they thought about path lifting but couldn't extend it. Their detailed attempt talks about overlapping open sets and choosing preimages consistently.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. X is the union of the four sides of [0,1]×[0,1] and the vertical segments x=1/n for n≥2 (since 1/2, 1/3, etc.) within the square.\n2. Covering space is a covering map p: ~X → X.\n3. The left edge of X is the segment {0}×[0,1].\n4. The problem requires showing some neighborhood around the left edge lifts homeomorphically to ~X.\n5. Deduce that X has no simply-connected covering space.\n\nWait, the problem statement from Hatcher says \"for every covering space... there is some neighbourhood of the left edge...\". So the key assumptions are the definition of X and the properties of covering spaces. The user's attempt adds details about their approach but those are part of their thought process, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list the components of X and the properties given. Let me structure that:\n\nAssumption:\n- $X$ is a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$,\n- $X$ consists of the four sides of the square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$,\n- $X$ includes the vertical segments $x = \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\ldots$ within the square,\n- $\\tilde{X}$ is a covering space of $X$ with covering map $p: \\tilde{X} \\to X$,\n- The left edge of $X$ is the segment $\\{0\\} \\times [0,1]$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that for every covering space $\\tilde{X} \\to X$, there exists a neighborhood of the left edge of $X$ that lifts homeomorphically to $\\tilde{X}$. Deduce that $X$ has no simply-connected covering space.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, addressing one object or condition. The components of X are split into separate lines. The covering space and the left edge are separate as well.",
