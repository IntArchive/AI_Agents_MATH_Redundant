    "Content": "Let $F$ be a field, $f(x)$ a non-constant polynomial, $E$ the splitting field of $f$ over $F$, $G=\\mathrm{Aut}_F\\;E$. How can I prove that $G$ acts transitively on the roots of $f$ if and only if $f$ is irreducible? (if we suppose that $f$ doesn't have linear factor and has degree at least 2, then we can take 2 different roots that are not in $F$, say $\\alpha,\\beta$, then the automorphism that switches these 2 roots and fixes the others and fixes also $F$, is in $G$, but I'm not using the irreducibility, so where is my mistake?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As noted, the claim is false if $f(x)$ is a perfect power of an irreducible polynomial. One direction always holds. To prove that if $f(x)$ is irreducible then the action is transitive, you can use the following result as a lemma: Theorem. Let $F$ and $L$ be fields, and let $\\sigma\\colon F\\to L$ be a field isomorphism. Let $g(x)\\in F[x]$ be a nonzero polynomial, let $\\sigma g(x)=h(x)\\in L[x]$ be the corresponding polynomial. If $K$ is a splitting field for $g(x)$ over $F$, and $M$ is a splitting field of $h(x)$ over $L$, then $\\sigma$ extends to an isomorphism $\\tau\\colon K\\to M$ such that $\\tau|_{F}=\\sigma$. With this theorem in hand, proceed as follows: let $u,v$ be two roots of $f(x)$ in $K$. Then there exists an isomorphism $\\sigma\\colon F(u)\\cong F(v)$ that is the identity on $F$ and maps $u$ to $v$ (since $F(u)\\cong F[x]/(f(x)) \\cong F(v)$). Now view $K$ as a splitting field for $f(x)$ over both $F(u)$ and $F(v)$ to obtain an extension of $\\sigma$ to all of $K$. This gives you an automorphism of $K$ that fixes $K$ and maps $u$ to $v$, proving that $\\mathrm{Aut}_F(K)$ acts transitive on the roots. Note however that it may be impossible to find an automorphism that has a particular cycle structure on the roots; for instance, your automorphism may just permute the roots cyclically, as in the case of a splitting field of an irreducible polynomial of degree $3$ with three real roots over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If $f(x)$ is not irreducible and not a power of an irreducible polynomial , let $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$ be two distinct irreducible factors of $f(x)$ in $F[x]$; if $u$ is a root of $g_1(x)$, then for every $\\sigma\\in\\mathrm{Aut}_F(K)$, we have $\\sigma(u)$ is a root of $g_1(x)$; hence it is never a root of $g_2(x)$, since $g_2(x)\\neq g_1(x)$ and distinct irreducibles have distinct roots in the splitting field; so there are roots of $f(x)$ (namely, those of $g_2(x)$) that are not in the $\\mathrm{Aut}_F(K)$-orbit of $u$, proving that the action is not transitive. The proof of the theorem above is by induction on $[K:F]$. If $[K:F]=1$, then $\\tau=\\sigma$ works. If $[K:F]\\gt 1$, let $h(x)$ be an irreducible factor of $g(x)$ of degree greater than $1$ (which must exist, otherwise $g$ splits in $F$), and let $\\sigma h$ be the corresponding factor of $\\sigma g$. Let $u\\in K$ be a root of $h$, let $v\\in M$ be a root of $\\sigma h$. Then $\\sigma$ extends to an isomorphism $\\rho\\colon F(u)\\cong L(v)$ that maps $u$ to $v$, since $F(u)\\cong F[x]/(h(x)) \\cong L[x]/(\\sigma h(x)) \\cong L(v)$. Then, inductively, $\\rho$ extends to an isomorphism $\\tau\\colon K\\to M$ that restricts to $\\rho$ on $F(u)$ and hence to $\\sigma$ on $F$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read through the original question on Math Stack Exchange and identify the key components: the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe title is \"When the group of automorphisms of an extension of fields acts transitively\". The user is asking about proving that the automorphism group G acts transitively on the roots of a polynomial f if and only if f is irreducible. They also mention some conditions: f doesn't have a linear factor, has degree at least 2, and they tried constructing an automorphism switching two roots without using irreducibility, which might be a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The problem states:\n\n- F is a field.\n- f(x) is a non-constant polynomial.\n- E is the splitting field of f over F.\n- G = Aut_F E (the group of automorphisms of E that fix F).\n- The goal is to prove G acts transitively on roots of f iff f is irreducible.\n\nBut the user also adds some conditions in their explanation: f doesn't have a linear factor (so it's not factorable into linear terms over F) and has degree at least 2. However, the original problem statement might not explicitly mention these. Wait, the original problem says \"if we suppose that f doesn't have linear factor and has degree at least 2...\" So those are additional assumptions made in their attempted proof. But the main problem is about the general case. So perhaps the assumptions for the problem as posed are:\n\n- F is a field.\n- f(x) is a non-constant polynomial over F.\n- E is the splitting field of f over F.\n- G is the group Aut_F E.\n- The problem is to prove G acts transitively on roots of f if and only if f is irreducible.\n\nBut wait, the user's confusion arises when they assume f has no linear factor and degree at least 2. However, in the main problem statement, the user is asking about the general case. So perhaps the assumptions for the problem are just the basic ones: F is a field, f is non-constant, E is splitting field, G is automorphism group. Then the problem is to show transitivity iff irreducible. But the user's mistake might be in not considering irreducibility, so maybe the actual problem requires f to be irreducible. However, the problem is phrased as an equivalence: transitively acts iff irreducible. So both directions.\n\nBut the user is confused because they tried to construct an automorphism switching two roots when f is reducible (since they assume f has no linear factors, which might mean it's reducible into higher-degree factors). So their example might not satisfy the conditions for the automorphism to exist, hence why irreducibility is needed.\n\nTherefore, the problem as posed is: Prove that G acts transitively on the roots of f if and only if f is irreducible. The assumptions given in the problem are:\n\n1. F is a field.\n2. f(x) is a non-constant polynomial over F.\n3. E is the splitting field of f over F.\n4. G is the automorphism group Aut_F(E).\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions in their attempted proof that they suppose f doesn't have a linear factor and has degree at least 2. Are those part of the problem's assumptions or just their own? The main problem seems to be general, so those might be specific conditions the user is considering, but the original problem doesn't state them. So perhaps the assumptions are only the four above, and the problem is the equivalence. However, in the example given by the user, they take two different roots not in F, implying that f has at least two roots outside F, which would be the case if f is irreducible (since if f is reducible, it might split into factors over F, but even reducible polynomials can have roots outside F). Wait, but if f is reducible, say f = g*h, then the roots of g and h are in E, but if g and h are irreducible over F, then their roots are in different orbits under G. Therefore, if f is reducible, G might not act transitively.\n\nSo, the main problem's assumptions are the four listed, and the problem is to show that transitivity of G on roots of f is equivalent to f being irreducible. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include:\n\n- F is a field.\n- f is a non-constant polynomial over F.\n- E is the splitting field of f over F.\n- G is the group of F-automorphisms of E.\n\nBut the user also mentions in their attempted proof that f has no linear factors and degree at least 2. However, the problem as posed doesn't specify these. The original question is more general: how to prove the equivalence. So those conditions (no linear factors, degree ≥2) might be part of the user's own attempt but are not part of the original problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would be as listed above, and the problem is the equivalence between transitivity and irreducibility.\n\nBut wait, the user's confusion comes from their specific case where f is reducible (no linear factors, degree ≥2) but they still can construct an automorphism, which contradicts the necessity of irreducibility. Therefore, the actual problem must have the conditions that f is irreducible if and only if G acts transitively on roots, under the general assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the main assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\nf(x) is a non-constant polynomial over F,\nE is the splitting field of f over F,\nG is the group of F-automorphisms of E.\n\nProblem:\nProve that G acts transitively on the roots of f if and only if f is irreducible.\n\nBut wait, the user's question mentions \"if we suppose that f doesn't have linear factor and has degree at least 2, then we can take 2 different roots that are not in F...\". So perhaps in their attempted proof, they are assuming f is reducible (since it has no linear factors but degree ≥2), and yet they can construct an automorphism switching two roots. But according to the theorem, if f is reducible, G should not act transitively. Therefore, their mistake is in assuming such an automorphism exists when f is reducible. So the actual assumptions for the problem are the basic ones, and the problem is the equivalence.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should include all the main assumptions from the original problem statement, which are the four listed above. The user's additional conditions (no linear factors, degree ≥2) are part of their own reasoning, not the original problem's assumptions.",
