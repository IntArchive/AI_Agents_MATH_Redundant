    "Content": "I looked around and found that integrals of the form $$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{m-1}}{a+x^n}, a,m,n \\in \\mathbb{R}, 0<m<n, 0<a$$ seem to occur very often: Just to give a few examples (the formula given below would solve them all right away): How can I compute the integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{dt}{1+t^4}$? Simpler way to compute a definite integral without resorting to partial fractions? Is this definite integral really independent of a parameter? How can it be shown? Integrating $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^2 + 2x + 2} \\mathrm{d} x$ Even more surprising was that there seems to be a (quite beautiful) closed form, namely: $$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{m-1}}{a+x^n}=\\frac{\\pi}{n}  \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{1-\\frac{m}{n}} \\csc \\left(m \\cdot \\frac{\\pi \n   }{n}\\right)$$ (This result is from Mathematica). I tried to derive this result by integrating (brute force) but you get hypergeometric functions which I don't like. Therefore I would like to know if there is a straight-forward way to get this by hand.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Well there is actually a formula which I found in Gamelin's complex analysis book. This is problem number $7$ Exercise VII.4 Page No. 208 . This works for the case $a=1$. So if you have $a=1$, then $$\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{a-1}}{1+x^{b}} \\ \\text{dx} = \\frac{\\pi}{b \\sin(\\pi{a}/b)}, \\quad 0 < a < b$$ Set $$I = \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{a-1}}{1+x^{b}} \\ \\text{dx}$$ and integrate $$f(z) = \\frac{z^{a-1}}{1+z^{b}} = \\frac{|z|^{a-1} \\cdot e^{i(a-1)\\text{arg}(z)}}{1+|z|^{b}e^{ib\\text{arg}(z)}}$$ Simple pole at $z_{1} = e^{\\pi{i}/b}$ and hence $$\\text{Res} \\Biggl[\\frac{z^{a-1}}{1+z^{b}}, e^{\\pi{i}/b}\\Biggr] = \\frac{z^{a-1}}{bz^{b-1}}\\Biggl|_{z =e^{\\pi i / b}} = -\\frac{1}{b}e^{\\pi i a/b}$$ Integrate along $\\gamma_{1}$, and let $R \\to \\infty$ and let $ \\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$. This gives, \n  \\begin{align*}\n \\int\\limits_{\\gamma_{1}} f(z) \\ dz & = \\int\\limits_{\\gamma_{1}}  \\frac{|z|^{a-1} \\cdot e^{i(a-1)\\text{arg}(z)}}{1+|z|^{b}e^{ib\\text{arg}(z)}} \\ dz \\\\\\ &= \\int\\limits_{\\epsilon}^{R} \\frac{x^{a-1}}{1+x^{b}} \\to \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{a-1}}{1+x^{b}} \\ dx =I\n\\end{align*} Integrate along $\\gamma_{2}$, and let $R \\to \\infty$. This gives $0 < a < b$ and $$\\Biggl|\\int\\limits_{\\gamma_{2}} f(z) dz \\Biggr| \\leq \\frac{R^{a-1}}{R^{b}-1} \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi R}{b} \\sim \\frac{2 \\pi}{b R^{b-a}} \\to 0$$ Integrate along $\\gamma_{3}$ and let $R \\to \\infty$ and $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$. This gives \n  \\begin{align*}\n\\int\\limits_{\\gamma_{3}} f(z) \\ dz &= \\int\\limits_{\\gamma_{3}}  \\frac{|z|^{a-1} \\cdot e^{i(a-1)\\text{arg}(z)}}{1+|z|^{b}e^{ib\\text{arg}(z)}} = \\Biggl[\\begin{array}{c} z=x e^{2\\pi i/b} \\\\\\ dz=e^{2\\pi i/b} \\ dx \\end{array}\\Biggr] \\\\\\ &= \\int\\limits_{R}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{x^{a-1}e^{2\\pi i(a-1)/b}}{1+x^{b}} \\cdot e^{2\\pi i b} \\ dx \\to \\int\\limits_{\\infty}^{0} \\frac{x^{a-1}e^{2\\pi i(a-1)/b}}{1+x^{b}} \\cdot e^{2\\pi i b} \\ dx \\\\\\ &= -e^{2\\pi ia/b}I\n\\end{align*} Integrate along $\\gamma_{4}$ and let $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$. This gives $0 < a <b$, $$\\Biggl|\\int\\limits_{\\gamma_{4}} f(z) \\ dz \\Biggr| \\leq \\frac{\\epsilon^{a-1}}{1-\\epsilon^{b}} \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi\\epsilon}{b} \\sim \\frac{2\\pi\\epsilon}{b} \\to 0$$ Using the $\\text{Residue Theorem}$ and letting $R \\to \\infty$ and $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$, we obtain that $$ I + 0 - e^{2\\pi a/b}I + 0 = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\Bigl(-\\frac{1}{b} e^{\\pi ia/b}\\Bigr)$$ This yields, $$(e^{-\\pi i a/b} - e^{\\pi i a./b})I= -\\frac{2\\pi i}{b}$$ and hence solving for $I$, we have $$I= \\frac{2\\pi i}{b \\cdot (e^{\\pi ia/b} - e^{-\\pi i a/b})}=\\frac{\\pi}{b \\sin(\\pi a/b)}$$ Actually I have taken this answer from, one of my posts: You can see that as well.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this integral problem. The user wants to prove the closed-form formula for the integral from 0 to infinity of x^(m-1)/(a + x^n) dx. The given answer is (π/n) * (1/a)^(1 - m/n) * csc(mπ/n). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the assumptions. The original problem mentions that a, m, n are real numbers, with 0 < m < n and 0 < a. So, the conditions are on the parameters a, m, n. Let me list those out. The integral is from 0 to infinity, so the limits are fixed. The integrand is a rational function with x raised to some exponents. \n\nThe user's example shows that each assumption should be on one line, addressing one property per object. So, for the integral, the variables a, m, n are real numbers. Then, 0 < m < n, which is another condition. Also, a is positive. These are separate conditions. \n\nThe problem statement should then be to evaluate the integral and show that it equals the given closed-form expression. The original problem is asking how to derive this result by hand without getting into hypergeometric functions. So the problem part would state to prove the integral formula.\n\nLet me check if there are any other assumptions. The integral is definite from 0 to infinity, which is part of the problem statement. The parameters are given as a, m, n in real numbers with the constraints 0 < m < n and a > 0. So each of these should be separate assumptions. \n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single condition on a single object. So here, similarly, each parameter's condition should be separate. So:\n\nAssumption:\na, m, n are real numbers,\n0 < m < n,\na > 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{m-1}}{a+x^n} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{1 - \\frac{m}{n}} \\csc\\left( \\frac{m\\pi}{n} \\right).$$\n\nI need to make sure that in the problem statement, all variables are covered under the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to infinity, which is part of the problem, not an assumption. The parameters a, m, n have their conditions listed. The original question mentions that 0 < m < n and a > 0, so those are the key constraints. \n\nYes, this should be the formatted problem as per the user's instructions. Let me verify against the example. The example listed each assumption line by line. Here, the three conditions are a, m, n are real numbers; 0 < m < n; a > 0. That should cover all the necessary assumptions. The problem is to prove the integral equals the given expression. \n\nI think that's correct. The user might have some typos or formatting issues, but according to their example, this should be the right structure. The key is to filter out the extra information, like the examples of integrals the user mentioned (the 1/(1+t^4) etc.), and focus on the core problem and its assumptions.",
