    "Content": "I would like a proof that\n$$ {{n}\\choose{k}} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = 2^m $$\nfor $n,k,m\\in \\mathbb{N}$, only if $k=1$ or $k=n-1$. It seems to me that this must be true since for other values of $k$ the numerator contains more factors that are not powers of 2 than the denominator. Furthermore, the numerator also contains larger factors than the denominator and thus can't all be cancelled. Nevertheless, I have been unable to form an elegant, watertight proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Betrand's Postulate implies that for $n \\ge 1$ there is always a prime $p$ with $n < p \\le 2n$. Sylvester strengthened this result to: If $n \\ge 2k$ then at least one of the numbers $n, n - 1, n - 2, \\cdots, n - k + 1$ has a prime divisor $p > k$. Hence if $n \\ge 2k$, which we can always assume since $\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n - k}$, then $$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!} $$ has a prime $p$ in the numerator with $p > k$. Hence $p \\mid \\binom{n}{k}$. Since we are assuming $k, n - k \\ge 2$ this shows that $\\binom{n}{k}$ is not a power of $2$. Reference M. Aigner Proofs from THE BOOK , Springer (2014), 5th ed.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!) is a power of 2 only when k is 1 or n-1. First, I need to understand the assumptions and the problem structure as per the required format.\n\nAssumptions: The problem states that n, k, m are natural numbers, and the binomial coefficient equals 2^m. So each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. k is a natural number.\n3. m is a natural number.\n4. The binomial coefficient C(n, k) equals 2^m.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that this can only happen if k is 1 or n-1. \n\nNow, checking the example provided earlier, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, each parameter (n, k, m) is a natural number, and the equality C(n,k)=2^m holds. So the assumptions should list each of these conditions separately.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user structured the assumption as two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in the current problem, the original question states \"for n, k, m in N\", which translates to each being natural numbers. So each of those should be separate assumptions. Additionally, the equation C(n,k)=2^m is another assumption.\n\nHowever, in the example, the divisibility by 7 was an extra condition. Here, the main condition is that the binomial coefficient is a power of 2. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- k is a natural number.\n- m is a natural number.\n- The binomial coefficient C(n, k) equals 2^m.\n\nBut the problem statement is to show that this can only hold if k=1 or k=n-1. Therefore, the problem part is: \"Prove that {{n}\\choose{k}} = 2^m implies k=1 or k=n-1 for n, k, m ∈ ℕ.\"\n\nWait, the original problem states \"only if k=1 or k=n-1\". So the problem is to prove that the only solutions to C(n, k)=2^m are when k is 1 or n-1. So the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nChecking the example again, the problem part restates the equation and the required divisibility. So here, the problem should be phrased as: \"Prove that {{n}\\choose{k}} = 2^m implies k=1 or k=n-1 for n, k, m ∈ ℕ.\"\n\nBut the original question's wording is \"only if\", so maybe the problem statement should be: \"Prove that if {{n}\\choose{k}} = 2^m for n, k, m ∈ ℕ, then k=1 or k=n-1.\"\n\nAlternatively, following the example structure, the problem part would state the equation and the conclusion to be proven. The example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the conclusion is that k must be 1 or n-1.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nk is a natural number,\nm is a natural number,\nThe binomial coefficient {{n}\\choose{k}} equals 2^m.\n\nProblem:\nProve that k must be 1 or n-1.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So each line should be a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn ∈ ℕ,\nk ∈ ℕ,\nm ∈ ℕ,\n{{n}\\choose{k}} = 2^m.\n\nProblem:\nProve that k = 1 or k = n - 1.\n\nYes, that fits the format. Each line under assumption is a single condition on one object. Then the problem is to show the conclusion.",
