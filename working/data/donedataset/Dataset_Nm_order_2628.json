    "Content": "Lebesgue Radon Nikodym Theorem Let $\\nu$ be a $\\sigma$ -finite signed measure on $(X,\\mathcal{A})$ and $\\mu$ a $\\sigma$ -finite positive measure on $(X,\\mathcal{A})$ There exist unique $\\sigma$ -finite signed measures $\\rho,\\lambda$ on $(X,\\mathcal{A})$ such that $$\\nu=\\rho+\\lambda\\qquad \\rho \\ll\\mu,\\qquad\\lambda \\perp \\mu.$$ There exists an extended $\\mu$ -integrable function $f$ such that $d\\rho=f\\,d\\mu$ i.e. $$\\nu=f\\,d\\mu+\\lambda$$ If we also have $\\nu=\\tilde{f}\\,d\\mu+\\lambda$ where $\\tilde{f}$ is an extended $\\mu$ -integrable function, then $$\\tilde{f}=f\\quad\\mu\\text{-a.e}$$ Proof. Case 1 Suppose first that $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are both finite, positive measures. On this first step I have no problems Case 2 Suppose that $\\mu$ , $\\nu$ are both $\\sigma$ -finite positive measure. We can write $$X=\\bigcup_l E_j\\quad\\text{and}\\quad X=\\bigcup_k F_k,$$ with $\\mu(E_j)<\\infty$ , $\\nu(F_k)<\\infty.$ Then $$X=\\bigcup_{j,k}(E_j\\cap F_k)=\\bigcup_l A_l$$ disjointly with $\\mu(A_l), \\nu(A_l)<\\infty.$ Define $$\\mu_k(E)=\\mu(E\\cap A_k)\\quad \\nu_k(E)=\\nu(E\\cap A_k),$$ so by case 1. we can write $\\nu_k=\\rho_k+\\lambda_k$ for some unique measures with $\\rho_k \\ll \\mu_k$ and $\\lambda_k\\perp \\mu_k.$ Note that $$\\mu_k(A_k^c)=\\mu(A_k^c\\cap A_k)=0,$$ so $A_k^c$ is a $\\mu_k-$ null set. Therefore $$f^{'}_k=f_k\\chi_{A_k}$$ equals $f_k$ $\\mu_k-$ a.e, so we can replace $f_k$ with $f^{'}_k$ without changing $\\lambda_k$ or $\\rho_k.$ In other words, we  can assume that $f_k(x)=0$ $\\forall x\\notin A_k.$ Since the $A_k$ are disjoint, we can therefore define $$f=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty f_k.$$ Since $f\\ge 0$ , $$d\\rho=f\\,d\\mu$$ defines a positive measure. Also, $$\\lambda=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\lambda_k$$ is a positive measure, since each $\\lambda_k\\ge 0$ Question I'm trying and trying again to show the following but I can't: $\\lambda, \\rho$ are $\\sigma$ -finite; $\\nu=\\rho+\\lambda$ ; $\\rho \\ll \\mu$ ; $\\lambda\\perp \\mu$ ; The uniqueness statements hold. Could you please give me some suggestions on the basis of what I have already shown?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ be two $\\sigma$ -finite measures. Then we can write $$\\bigsqcup_{j=1}^\\infty E_j=X=\\bigsqcup_{k=1}^\\infty F_k,$$ where $\\mu(E_j)<\\infty,\\nu(F_k)<\\infty$ , for all $k,j$ . Let's write $$X=\\bigsqcup_{k,j}E_j\\cap F_k=\\bigsqcup_{l=1} A_l.$$ Then, $\\mu(A_l)<\\infty,\\nu(A_l)<\\infty$ for all $l$ . Define two finite measure $\\mu_l:\\mathcal A\\ni E\\longmapsto \\mu(A_l\\cap E)$ and $\\nu_l:\\mathcal A\\ni E\\longmapsto \\nu(A_l\\cap E)$ for each $l\\geq 1$ . Now, we have $$\\nu_l=\\lambda_l+\\rho_l\\text{ for some measures }\\lambda_l,\\rho_l\\text{ with }\\lambda_l\\perp \\mu_l, \\rho_l\\ll\\mu_l\\text{ and }\\mathrm d\\rho_l=f_l\\ \\mathrm d\\mu_l$$ $$\\text{ for some }\\mu_l\\text{-integrable real valued non-negative function }f_l.$$ Since $\\mu_l(A_l^c)=\\nu_l(A_l^c)=0$ we have $\\displaystyle\\lambda_l(A_l^c)=\\mu_l(A_l^c)-\\int_{A_l^c}f_l\\ \\mathrm d\\mu_l=0$ . We can also assume $f_l=0$ on $A_l^c$ . $\\color{red}{\\text{Proof of (1):}}$ Now, let $\\displaystyle \\lambda=\\sum_l\\lambda_l$ and $\\displaystyle f=\\sum_lf_l$ . Note that $\\displaystyle\\lambda(A_i)=\\sum_l\\lambda_l(A_i)=\\lambda_i(A_i)<\\infty$ as $A_l$ are disjoint, i.e., $\\displaystyle A_i\\cap \\bigsqcup_{l\\not= i}A_l=\\emptyset$ and $\\lambda_l(A_l^c)=0$ . So, $\\displaystyle X= \\bigsqcup_{l=1} A_l$ is a decompostion of $X$ into finite $\\lambda$ -measure sets. Define $\\mathrm d\\rho:=f\\ \\mathrm d\\mu$ . Then $$\\begin{align}\\rho(A_i) &=\\int_{A_i} f\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\\\ &=\\int f1_{A_i}\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\\\ & =\\int\\left(\\sum_lf_l 1_{A_i}\\right)\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\\\ &=\\sum_l\\int f_l1_{A_i}\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\\\ &=\\int f_i1_{A_i}\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\end{align}$$ as $f_l(A_l^c)=0$ . Now, $\\displaystyle\\int f_i1_{A_i}\\ \\mathrm d\\mu=\\int f_i\\ \\mathrm d\\mu_i<\\infty$ , see definition of $\\mu_i$ . Note that interchange of summation and integral is possible here as all $f_l$ are non-negatives, so apply monotone convergence to partial sums. So, $\\displaystyle X= \\bigsqcup_{l=1} A_l$ is a decomposition of $X$ into finite $\\rho$ -measure sets. $\\square$ $\\color{red}{\\text{Proof of (2):}}$ Notice that $\\displaystyle\\nu=\\sum_l\\nu_l=\\sum_l\\lambda_l+\\sum_l\\rho_l=\\lambda+\\sum_l\\rho_l$ . Note that for any $B\\in \\mathcal A$ we have $\\displaystyle B=\\bigsqcup_l B\\cap A_l$ . So, $\\displaystyle\\rho(B)=\\sum_l\\rho(B\\cap A_l).$ But as in the previous paragraph we have $$\\begin{align}\\rho(A_i\\cap B) &=\\int_{A_i\\cap B} f\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\\\ &=\\int f1_{A_i\\cap B}\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\\\ &=\\int\\left(\\sum_lf_l 1_{A_i\\cap B}\\right)\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\\\ &=\\sum_l\\int f_l1_{A_i\\cap B}\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\\\ &=\\int f_i1_{A_i\\cap B}\\ \\mathrm d\\mu\\end{align}$$ as $f_l(A_l^c)=0$ . Now, $\\displaystyle\\int f_i1_{A_i\\cap B}\\ \\mathrm d\\mu=\\int_B f_i\\ \\mathrm d\\mu_i=\\rho_i(B)$ . So, $\\displaystyle\\rho(A_i\\cap B)=\\sum_l\\rho(B\\cap A_l)=\\rho_i(B).$ Hence, $\\displaystyle\\sum_l\\rho_l=\\rho$ . Therefore, $\\displaystyle\\nu=\\lambda+\\rho$ . $\\square$ $\\color{red}{\\text{Proof of (3):}}$ Note that $\\mu(B)=0$ implies $\\displaystyle\\mu_i(B)=\\mu(B\\cap A_i)=0$ for all $i$ , then $\\displaystyle\\rho_i(B)=\\int_Bf_i\\ \\mathrm d\\mu_i=0$ . Since $\\displaystyle\\rho(B)=\\sum_l\\rho_l(B)=0$ , we are done. $\\square$ $\\color{red}{\\text{Proof of (4):}}$ Since $\\mu_l\\perp\\lambda_l$ , write $X=W_l\\sqcup U_l$ with $U_l$ is null for $\\mu_l$ , $W_l$ is null for $\\lambda_l$ . Let, $\\widetilde W_l=W_l\\cap A_l,\\widetilde U_l=U_l\\cap A_l$ . Then let $$W=\\bigsqcup_l \\widetilde W_l, U=\\bigsqcup_l \\widetilde U_l,$$ see $A_l$ are disjoint. Now, $$W\\cap U=\\emptyset\\text{ and }W\\cup U=\\bigcup_l\\big(\\widetilde W_l\\cup \\widetilde U_l\\big)=\\bigcup_lA_l=X.$$ Next, $U$ is null for $\\mu$ and $W$ is null for $\\lambda$ as $\\displaystyle\\mu(U)=\\sum_l\\mu_l(U)=\\sum_l\\sum_j\\mu_l(\\widetilde U_j)=0$ . Similarly for other. $\\square$ $\\color{red}{\\text{Proof of (5):}}$ Now, if $f_l'$ also satisfies the above then, $f_l$ is $\\mu_l$ equal to $f_l'$ , i.e., $\\mu(Z_l\\cap A_l)=\\mu_l(Z_l)=0$ , where $Z_l=\\{f_l\\not =f_l'\\}$ . Note that we can assume, as previously said, $f_l(A_l^c)=0$ and $f_l'(A_l^c)=0$ , so that $Z_l\\subseteq A_l$ , so that $\\mu(Z_l)=\\mu(Z_l\\cap A_l)=0$ . Now let $$f'=\\sum_lf_l',$$ then $\\{f\\not=f'\\}=\\cup_l Z_l$ and so, $\\mu\\big(\\{f\\not=f'\\}\\big)=\\sum_l \\mu(Z_l)=0$ . $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking about the Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym theorem in the σ-finite case. They've already gone through the proof for finite measures and extended it to the σ-finite case by decomposing the space X into disjoint sets A_k where both μ and ν are finite. They defined measures μ_k and ν_k restricted to each A_k, applied the finite case to get ρ_k and λ_k, then combined these to form ρ and λ. Now, they're struggling to show that the combined measures ρ and λ are σ-finite, satisfy ν = ρ + λ, that ρ ≪ μ, λ ⊥ μ, and the uniqueness.\n\nFirst, let's recall the setup. X is decomposed into disjoint A_k with μ(A_k) and ν(A_k) finite. Each ν_k (which is ν restricted to A_k) is decomposed into ρ_k + λ_k where ρ_k ≪ μ_k (μ restricted to A_k) and λ_k ⊥ μ_k. Then ρ is the sum of all ρ_k and λ is the sum of all λ_k. The function f is the sum of the f_k (from dρ_k = f_k dμ_k), set to zero outside each A_k.\n\nFor σ-finiteness of ρ and λ: Each ρ_k is absolutely continuous w.r.t μ_k, which is finite on A_k. Since ρ_k is concentrated on A_k and μ is σ-finite, then each ρ_k is σ-finite (since μ_k is finite on A_k, and ρ_k = f_k dμ_k, so ρ_k(A_k) is finite). Similarly, λ_k is concentrated on some set B_k where μ_k(B_k) = 0 (since λ_k ⊥ μ_k). Since the A_k are disjoint, the B_k are also disjoint, and each λ_k is finite (as ν is σ-finite and λ_k ≤ ν_k which is finite on A_k). So summing over k gives σ-finite λ and ρ.\n\nFor ν = ρ + λ: Since on each A_k, ν_k = ρ_k + λ_k, summing over k gives ν = sum ν_k = sum (ρ_k + λ_k) = sum ρ_k + sum λ_k = ρ + λ.\n\nρ ≪ μ: Each ρ_k ≪ μ_k, which is μ restricted to A_k. Since μ_k is part of μ, and ρ is the sum, if μ(E) = 0, then μ(E ∩ A_k) = 0 for each k, so ρ_k(E) = 0, hence ρ(E) = sum ρ_k(E) = 0.\n\nλ ⊥ μ: For each λ_k, there exists a set B_k where λ_k is concentrated on B_k and μ_k(B_k) = 0. Let B = union B_k. Then λ is concentrated on B, and μ(B) = sum μ(B_k) since B_k are disjoint (as A_k are). But μ(B_k) = μ_k(B_k) = 0, so μ(B) = 0. Hence λ ⊥ μ.\n\nUniqueness: Suppose there's another decomposition ν = ρ' + λ'. Restricting to each A_k, ν_k = ρ'_k + λ'_k. By uniqueness in the finite case (Case 1), ρ'_k = ρ_k and λ'_k = λ_k. Summing over k gives ρ' = ρ and λ' = λ.\n\nSo, the key steps are leveraging the σ-finite decomposition into finite parts, applying the finite case results, and then combining them appropriately while ensuring σ-finiteness and the required absolute continuity and singularity.",
