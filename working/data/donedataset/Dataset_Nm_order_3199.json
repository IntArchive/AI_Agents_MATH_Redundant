    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure the problem from the given Math Stack Exchange question. Let me read through the original problem again carefully.\n\nThe user is trying to prove an integral involving the square of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, K(x). The integral is from 0 to 1 of [x*K(x)^2]/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, and they want to show it equals a specific hypergeometric function expression. The user attempted using hypergeometric series expansions and transformations but ended up with a result that numerically doesn't match. There's also an alternative solution mentioned using Fourier-Legendre expansion and Parseval's theorem.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem is to prove that the integral equals the given hypergeometric function. The assumptions would be any given conditions or properties used. Let me check:\n\nThe problem mentions integrating from 0 to 1, so the limits are part of the problem statement. The integrand is x*K(x)^2 / sqrt(1 - x²). The elliptic integral K(x) is defined here, and the user references some representations of K(x) as hypergeometric functions. But in the problem statement itself, are there any explicit assumptions given?\n\nLooking at the original problem statement: The user states the integral equals a specific hypergeometric function. The problem is to prove this equality. The assumptions here would be the definitions and properties of the elliptic integral K(x) and possibly the convergence of the integral and series involved. However, in the example provided earlier, the assumption included conditions on n. Here, the integral is definite from 0 to 1, and the function K(x) is the standard complete elliptic integral of the first kind, which is defined for 0 ≤ x < 1. But since x is approaching 1, we might need to consider behavior there, but the problem doesn't state any specific conditions beyond the integral itself.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this current problem, there are no such variables with conditions. The integral is definite, so the variables are integrated out. The main objects here are the elliptic integral K(x) and the hypergeometric function. The assumptions would be the standard definitions of K(x) and its hypergeometric representations, but since those are part of the problem's context, maybe there's no need to list them as assumptions unless specified. But the problem as posed is to prove the equality, so the main assumption is the integral as given. Wait, perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the integral itself: the limits of integration, the integrand's form, and the use of K(x) as the elliptic integral.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are conditions applied to the objects in the problem. Here, the integral is definite from 0 to 1, so perhaps that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The problem is to prove that this integral equals the hypergeometric expression. Therefore, the assumptions would be the properties of K(x) necessary for the proof, but since the user is referencing Brychkov's book, perhaps the key assumption is that K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with its standard definition.\n\nWait, but the example given had explicit assumptions on n. Here, the problem is about an integral, so maybe the only assumption is related to the variable of integration, x, being in [0,1], but that's part of the integral's limits. The example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the problem as presented, the assumptions should include that x is a real variable in the interval [0,1], and that K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which was actually part of the original problem's conditions (though in the example, the user had to filter that; the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back: in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem under assumptions had \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might have been an error. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem under assumptions listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; perhaps that was a mistake in the example? Wait, maybe the example was a different case. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not requiring divisibility by 7. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps the user made a mistake there. Because if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption is just that n is an integer, and the conclusion is divisibility by 91. But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem had a mistake in the assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a different problem where n was supposed to be divisible by 7, but the original problem stated \"for every integer n\".\n\nHmm, that's confusing. But regardless, following the user's example, perhaps the idea is to list all the conditions that the problem assumes. In the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, and K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over x in [0,1].\n- K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n- The integrand is x*K(x)^2 / sqrt(1 - x²).\n\nBut wait, the problem states the integral as given, so the integral's setup is part of the problem statement. The assumptions would be any underlying conditions required for the integral to hold, such as convergence, or properties of K(x). But the problem as posed is to prove the equality, so maybe the only assumption is the definition of K(x) as the complete elliptic integral. Alternatively, since the problem is presented as is, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's setup. But in the example, they listed the variable's properties. Here, the variable x is integrated out, so perhaps no assumptions on x except that it's a real variable between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but the example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption because the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Here, the integral is definite, so maybe the only assumption is that K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. Alternatively, maybe there's an assumption that the integral converges, but that's typically part of the problem statement. Since the user is asking to prove the equality, the main assumption is the integral as given. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n- The integral is evaluated over the interval [0,1].\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the variable x is integrated from 0 to 1, so maybe the assumption is that x is a real variable in [0,1], and K(x) is defined accordingly. But in the example, the assumption was on n being an integer. Maybe in this problem, there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's setup. Alternatively, since the problem involves hypergeometric functions, maybe there's an assumption about the convergence of the series involved, but that's more part of the proof.\n\nLooking at the user's attempt, they used hypergeometric representations of K(x), so maybe those are part of the problem's assumptions. However, the problem statement itself doesn't specify those; it's the user's attempt that brings them in. Therefore, the main problem is to prove the integral equals the given hypergeometric expression, with the assumption that K(x) is the standard elliptic integral. Hence, the formatted problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since the problem is about the integral, the assumptions are inherent in the integral's definition. However, following the example's structure, where the assumption listed the variable's properties, here the integral is over x from 0 to 1, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable in the interval [0, 1],\nK(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were listed as separate lines for each condition. So each assumption is a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over x from 0 to 1,\nK(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind,\nThe integrand is x*K(x)^2 divided by sqrt(1 - x²).\n\nWait, but the integrand is part of the problem statement. The example's formatted problem included the expression of A(n) in the problem section, not in the assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions are about the variables and objects involved, not the expression itself. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number in the interval [0, 1],\nK(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral from 0 to 1 of [x*K(x)^2 / sqrt(1 - x²)] dx equals the given hypergeometric function expression.\n\nYes, that seems right. The problem statement includes the integral expression, and the assumptions are the conditions on x and the definition of K(x). So the formatted problem should list those assumptions and then the problem itself.",
