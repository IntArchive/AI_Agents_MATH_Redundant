    "Content": "This is a well known lemma that consistently appears in textbooks, either as a statement without proof, or as an exercise (see for example pp. 146 of Hatcher) If $0 \\stackrel{id}{\\to} A \\stackrel{f}{\\to} B \\stackrel{g}{\\to} C\\stackrel{h}{\\to} 0$ is a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups, then $\\operatorname{rank} B = \\operatorname{rank} A + \\operatorname{rank} C$ . I've been trying to prove this unsuccessfully. What do we know? $f$ is injective, $g$ is surjective, $\\mathrm{Im} f = \\mathrm{ker} g$ , $\\mathrm{Im} g = \\mathrm{ker} h$ , $C\\simeq B/A$ So I start with a maximally linearly independent subset $\\{ a_\\alpha \\}$ of $A$ such that the sum (with only finite non-zero entries) $$\\sum n_\\alpha a_\\alpha=0$$ for $n_\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ , implies that $n_\\alpha=0$ . Where to go from here is a puzzle? Any hints would be appreciated",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Pick a maximal linearly independent subset $\\{c_{\\beta}\\}$ of $C$. Now push the $a_{\\alpha}$ to $B$ using $f$, and for each $c_{\\beta}$ pick $c'_{\\beta}\\in B$ such that $g(c'_{\\beta}) = c_{\\beta}$. Now suppose that you have a finite linear combination of the $a_{\\alpha}$ and the $c'_{\\beta}$ that is equal to $0$,\n$$n_{\\alpha_1}f(a_{\\alpha_1}) + \\cdots + n_{\\alpha_k}f(a_{\\alpha_k}) + m_{\\beta_1}c'_{\\beta_1} + \\cdots + m_{\\beta_{\\ell}}c'_{\\beta_{\\ell}} = 0.$$\nUse $g$ to get a conclusion about the $m_{\\beta_j}$; then use $f$ to get a conclusion about the $n_{\\alpha_i}$. This will give you that $\\mathrm{rank}(B)\\geq \\mathrm{rank}(A)+\\mathrm{rank}(C)$. Do you also need help with the converse inequality?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and filter out any unrelated information.\n\nThe title of the question is \"Short Exact Sequences & Rank Nullity.\" The main goal is to prove that for a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups 0 → A → B → C → 0, the rank of B is equal to the rank of A plus the rank of C. The user mentions that this is a known lemma, often given without proof or as an exercise, like in Hatcher's book on page 146.\n\nThe user then outlines some known facts: f is injective, g is surjective, the image of f is the kernel of g, the image of g is the kernel of h, and C is isomorphic to B/A. They also mention starting with a maximally linearly independent subset of A and getting stuck on where to proceed from there.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The \"Assumption\" section needs to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The \"Problem\" is the statement to prove.\n\nFirst, the problem is about a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups. So, the objects involved are A, B, C. The conditions are that they are part of the short exact sequence, each is finitely generated and abelian. The properties include the maps f being injective, g being surjective, the image of f equals the kernel of g, and so on. However, since the exactness conditions are part of the structure of a short exact sequence, those might be considered inherent to the problem's setup rather than separate assumptions.\n\nBut according to the example provided, assumptions are listed as separate points. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions would be that A, B, C are finitely generated abelian groups, and there's a short exact sequence connecting them. Each of these should be separate lines.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: A, B, C are finitely generated abelian groups.\n\nAssumption 2: The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\n\nBut since the exactness involves multiple parts (injectivity of f, surjectivity of g, image equals kernel), but the problem structure example seems to list each assumption on separate lines. However, in the example, the assumptions were about different properties of the same object (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, perhaps each part of the exact sequence is considered a separate assumption? Wait, the original example didn't split the properties of the exact sequence into multiple assumptions. The example had two separate assumptions about n. So in this case, the main assumptions are that A, B, C are finitely generated abelian groups and that the given sequence is a short exact sequence. However, the exactness (injectivity of f, surjectivity of g, image equals kernel) are all part of the definition of a short exact sequence. So maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence of abelian groups.\n\n- A, B, C are finitely generated.\n\nBut since the problem statement already says \"short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups,\" perhaps the two assumptions are:\n\nEach group in the sequence is finitely generated.\n\nEach group in the sequence is abelian.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's given as a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups. So maybe the assumptions are that A, B, C are finitely generated abelian groups, and that the sequence is exact. But since exactness is part of the problem's given data, maybe split into:\n\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n\n- A, B, C are finitely generated abelian groups.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. Here, \"A is a finitely generated abelian group,\" \"B is a finitely generated abelian group,\" \"C is a finitely generated abelian group,\" and \"The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\" But perhaps the problem is structured as the entire sequence being a short exact sequence, and each group being finitely generated and abelian. However, the original problem statement already states all groups are finitely generated abelian groups. So each of these could be separate assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were split into different lines even if they applied to the same object. For example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions even though both apply to n. Here, each group being finitely generated and abelian can be considered as separate properties, but \"finitely generated abelian group\" is a single property. Since the example didn't split \"finitely generated\" and \"abelian\" into separate lines, maybe here we can take each group as being a finitely generated abelian group as a single assumption per group. Wait, but the original problem states \"short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups,\" which implies that all A, B, C are such. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n- B is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n- C is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n\nBut in the example, the problem had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. So here, perhaps the three groups being finitely generated abelian is considered one assumption each? But that might be redundant, as they are all part of the same problem. Alternatively, the problem statement might have one assumption that A, B, C are finitely generated abelian groups, and another that the sequence is exact. But the example listed two separate assumptions for n. So maybe each group's property is an assumption. Alternatively, given that the problem is about a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- A, B, C are finitely generated abelian groups.\n\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\n\nBut the problem is to prove rank B = rank A + rank C. So these are the necessary assumptions.\n\nHence, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA, B, and C are finitely generated abelian groups,\n\nThe sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that rank B = rank A + rank C.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's exactness is given by the sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0, which includes injectivity of f, surjectivity of g, image f = ker g, image g = ker h (where h is the map from C to 0). But perhaps the assumption is that the sequence is a short exact sequence, which encapsulates all those properties. So the two main assumptions are that the groups are finitely generated abelian and that the sequence is short exact.\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the example's structure, where each assumption is about a single object. But in the example, both assumptions were about n. Here, the objects are A, B, C, and the sequence. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nB is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nC is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nThe sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n\nBut that might be more precise. Each of A, B, C being finitely generated abelian is a separate assumption. Then the exactness of the sequence is another assumption. However, the original problem statement says \"a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups,\" which would imply that A, B, C are all finitely generated abelian groups and the sequence is exact. So maybe splitting into four lines as above is correct. But in the example, two assumptions about the same object (n) were split. So perhaps here, each group's property is a separate assumption. But \"finitely generated abelian group\" is a single property. So perhaps each group being finitely generated abelian is an assumption. Then the sequence being exact is another assumption.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"If 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups...\" So the conditions are: the sequence is a short exact sequence, and each group is finitely generated abelian. Thus, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\n\n2. A is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n3. B is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n4. C is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were listed as separate lines even if they applied to the same object. So in this case, each group being finitely generated abelian is a separate assumption. However, the problem states \"short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups,\" which already implies that all three groups are finitely generated abelian. Therefore, maybe the assumptions can be condensed into two:\n\n- A, B, C are finitely generated abelian groups.\n\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption is one property or condition applied to one object. Here, \"A, B, C are finitely generated abelian groups\" is three separate properties (each group has the property), so maybe each should be a separate line. Alternatively, since they are all part of the same problem statement, maybe it's considered one assumption. However, the example had two separate assumptions about the same object. Therefore, to follow the example's style, perhaps list each group's property as separate assumptions, even though they are part of the same problem statement.\n\nBut the example's original problem was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which are two separate properties of n. So here, each group being finitely generated abelian is a property of each group. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nB is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nC is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nThe sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\n\nBut the problem in the example didn't split the divisibility by 7 into separate assumptions, but here, since each group has a property, they need to be listed separately. Alternatively, since the problem statement says \"of finitely generated abelian groups,\" maybe that's a single assumption. However, the user's example split two properties of n into separate lines, so here, the three groups each being finitely generated abelian would need to be three separate assumptions. But that seems cumbersome. Alternatively, the problem statement could be considered to have one assumption that the sequence is a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups, which encompasses all three groups being finitely generated and abelian. But according to the example, each assumption is one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence,\n\nA is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nB is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nC is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nBut maybe even more precise. Since in the problem statement, the sequence is of finitely generated abelian groups, which implies that A, B, C are such. So perhaps the two main assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\n\n- A, B, and C are finitely generated abelian groups.\n\nBut this combines all three groups into one assumption. However, the user's example split two properties of the same object into separate assumptions, so perhaps we need to split here as well. If the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" which are two separate properties, then here, each group being finitely generated and abelian is a single property per group. Since a finitely generated abelian group is a single property, each group has that property. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nA is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nB is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nC is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nThe sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example's structure. Each line addresses one property of one object.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have four assumptions and the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"If $0 \\stackrel{id}{\\to} A \\stackrel{f}{\\to} B \\stackrel{g}{\\to} C\\stackrel{h}{\\to} 0$ is a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian groups, then $\\operatorname{rank} B = \\operatorname{rank} A + \\operatorname{rank} C$.\"\n\nSo the user is to prove that rank B equals rank A + rank C under these conditions.\n\nThe assumptions needed are:\n\n1. A is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n2. B is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n3. C is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\n4. The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is a short exact sequence.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove the rank equation.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nB is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nC is a finitely generated abelian group,\n\nThe sequence $0 \\to A \\stackrel{f}{\\to} B \\stackrel{g}{\\to} C \\to 0$ is a short exact sequence.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $\\operatorname{rank} B = \\operatorname{rank} A + \\operatorname{rank} C$.\n\nI think this covers all the necessary points. The key is to list each assumption line by line, each being one property or condition of one object. The problem is then to prove the rank equality.",
