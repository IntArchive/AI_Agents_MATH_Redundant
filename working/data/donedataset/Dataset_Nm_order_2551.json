    "Content": "I am a T.A at an introductory linear algebra course this semester, and before getting into vector spaces, we give them some basic examples and properties of fields. Since this is a first semester course, everything is very elementary and we do not have too many tools. I'd be happy to give them some elementary proof that there is no field of size $6$ (or some other small, concrete number, like 10... I just do not really care about the general case). They already know that $\\mathbb Z _6$ is not a field, but I want to show that there is no other possible field of this size. By elementary, I mean something which can be taught to math students on the second week to their first semester (so no arguments using groups and such). I can start talking about characteristics of fields and then show that the size has to be some power of the characteristic, but I'd prefer not to get into all of this. I am simply wondering if anyone here knows of an elementary proof for some concrete size (like $6$ ). Thank in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $F$ be a field with six elements. Since $|F|=6$ , the sequence $0$ , $1$ , $1+1$ , $1+1+1$ , ..., $6\\times 1$ must have a repetition. If $n\\times 1=m\\times 1$ for $n>m$ , then by subtraction we obtain $(n-m)\\times 1=0$ . Thus the first repetition must actually be $n\\times 1=0$ in the list above for some $2\\leq n\\leq 6$ . If $n\\times 1=0$ , then $n\\times a=0$ for all $a\\in F$ , and similarly if $m\\times a=0$ for some $a\\neq 0$ then $m\\times 1=0$ by dividing by $a$ . This shows that for any $a$ , $a$ , $a+a$ , ..., $(n-1)\\times a$ are all distinct. (This idea is due to Eric Wofsey in the comments below). If $n>2$ then $a+a\\neq 0$ for any $a\\neq 0$ , as we have seen above. This shows that $a\\neq -a$ for all non-zero $a$ . Thus, pairing $a$ with $-a$ for all $a\\in F\\setminus\\{0\\}$ , we see that $|F\\setminus\\{0\\}|$ is even. This contradiction means that $n=2$ . Thus $n=2$ . Let $a\\in F\\setminus\\{0,1\\}$ , and notice that $0,1,a,a+1$ are all distinct. (If $a+1=0$ then $a=1$ , if $a+1=a$ then $1=0$ , if $a+1=1$ then $a=0$ .) Notice that adding $1$ moves the elements $\\{0,1,a,a+1\\}$ around. If $b\\in F\\setminus\\{0,1,a,a+1\\}$ then $F$ must be $$F=\\{0,1,a,a+1,b,b+1\\}.$$ Where is $a+b$ ? It cannot equal $0$ ( $a=b$ ), it cannot equal $1$ ( $a=b+1$ ), or $a$ ( $b=0$ ) or $b$ ( $a=0$ ), or $a+1$ ( $b=1$ ) or $b+1$ ( $a=1$ ). (All of these are by cancellation.) So $a+b\\not\\in F$ , a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking for an elementary proof that there's no field with 6 elements. They mention that their students already know Z_6 isn't a field because, for example, 2*3=0 mod 6, and those are zero divisors, so it's not a field. But the question is to show that even if you tried to define a different field structure on a set of 6 elements, it's impossible. The key here is that the user wants this to be very elementary, avoiding group theory or characteristic arguments if possible.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic field theory. A finite field must have order p^n where p is prime and n ≥1. Since 6 is not a prime power (it factors into 2*3), there can't be a field of order 6. But proving this without invoking the general theorem is the challenge.\n\nHow to approach this elementarily? Let's think about possible additive structures. If the field has 6 elements, its additive group must be abelian. If the characteristic is a prime p, then the additive group is a vector space over Z_p, so the size must be p^k. So, for the field to have 6 elements, 6 must be a power of a prime. But 6 is 2*3, neither of which is a power of the other. Therefore, such a field can't exist. Wait, but this uses the concept of characteristic and vector spaces, which the user mentioned they might prefer to avoid.\n\nAlternatively, suppose there's a field F with 6 elements. Let's consider the additive order of 1. The characteristic is the smallest positive integer m such that m*1=0. For a field, m must be prime. So possible characteristics are 2 or 3. If the characteristic is 2, then the additive group has order 6, which must be isomorphic to (Z_2)^k where 2^k=6, but 6 isn't a power of 2. Similarly, characteristic 3 would require 3^k=6, which isn't possible. Therefore, no such field exists. But this still involves characteristics and vector spaces, which might be more advanced than desired.\n\nAnother approach: Let's assume F is a field with 6 elements. Then, the multiplicative group F* has 5 elements, which is a prime, so F* must be cyclic of order 5. So every non-zero element satisfies x^5 = 1. Now, consider the additive structure. Since F has 6 elements, the additive order of 1 must be 2 or 3 (primes dividing 6). Suppose the characteristic is 2. Then, every element added to itself is 0. But in the multiplicative group, every element has order 5, so x^5=1. Let's take an element a ≠0,1. Then a^5=1. But also, since the characteristic is 2, (a+1)^2 = a^2 + 1. But in a field of characteristic 2, (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2. Wait, maybe using the additive and multiplicative structures to derive a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, consider the possible orders of elements. If the multiplicative group has order 5, then by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element divides 5. So all non-zero elements have order 5. But in the additive group, the order of each element under addition must divide 6. So for example, if the characteristic is 2, then every element has additive order 2. But then, take an element a ≠0,1. Then 2a = 0 (additive order 2), but also a^5=1. Let's compute (1 + 1) in the field. If char 2, then 1+1=0. Then, consider expanding (1 +1)^5 using the binomial theorem. But in characteristic 2, all coefficients except the first and last are multiples of 2, hence zero. So (1+1)^5 = 1^5 +1^5 = 1 +1 = 0. But 1+1=0, so 0^5=0, which checks out, but maybe this doesn't lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, think about the additive inverses. In a field of characteristic 2, every element is its own additive inverse. So a + a =0 for all a. But in multiplicative terms, each non-zero element is a generator of the multiplicative group. Maybe considering the sum of all elements in the multiplicative group. The sum of all non-zero elements is some element in the field. But this might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that in any field, the equation x^2 = x has only 0 and 1 as solutions. Since in a field, a polynomial of degree n can have at most n roots. So x^2 -x =0 has exactly two roots: 0 and1. Now, if we have a field with 6 elements, then in the multiplicative group of order 5, every element satisfies x^5=1. So x^5 -1=0. This polynomial can have at most 5 roots, which it does. But also, since the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 5, the elements are the 5th roots of unity. Now, consider the element 1+1. If the characteristic is 2, then 1+1=0. If the characteristic is 3, then 1+1+1=0. Let's test both cases.\n\nCase 1: Characteristic 2. Then 1+1=0. Let's take an element a ≠0,1. Then a^5=1. Also, since the additive group has order 6, and characteristic 2, we can write the elements as 0,1,a,a^2,a^3,a^4. Let's consider a + a. Since char 2, a + a =0. But a ≠0, so a = -a, which is okay. Now, let's compute (1 + a)^2. Expanding, we get 1 + 2a + a^2. But in char 2, this is 1 +0 +a^2 =1 + a^2. But since (1 +a) is an element of the field, (1 +a)^2 must also be in the field. However, since every non-zero element satisfies x^5=1, we have that (1 +a)^5=1. Let's compute (1 +a)^5 using the binomial theorem. In characteristic 2, the coefficients are mod 2, so binomial coefficients where odd terms remain. So (1 +a)^5 =1 + a + a^2 + a^3 + a^4 + a^5. But a^5=1, so this becomes 1 +a +a^2 +a^3 +a^4 +1 = (1+1) + a +a^2 +a^3 +a^4 =0 + a +a^2 +a^3 +a^4. But this must equal 1, so a +a^2 +a^3 +a^4=1. But in the multiplicative group, the sum of all elements is (1 +a +a^2 +a^3 +a^4)= sum of all non-zero elements. However, the sum of all elements in the additive group is 0 (since it's a vector space over Z_2, and the sum of all elements in a vector space is 0 if the dimension is at least 1). Wait, but here the additive group is order 6, which is not a vector space over Z_2 because 6 is not a power of 2. This might be a contradiction. Wait, if F is a field of characteristic 2, then its additive group is a vector space over Z_2, so its size must be 2^k. But 6 is not a power of 2, so this is impossible. Similarly for characteristic 3. Hence, no field of order 6 exists. But this uses the vector space argument, which the user might not want.\n\nAlternatively, suppose you don't know about vector spaces. Let's consider that in a field of characteristic p (prime), the additive order of every element is p. So if there's a field with 6 elements, then either every element has additive order 2 (char 2) or 3 (char 3). But in additive group of order 6, the possible structures are Z_6 or Z_2 × Z_3. But Z_6 is cyclic of order 6. However, in a field of characteristic 2, the additive group must be elementary abelian 2-group, i.e., every element has order 2, so the additive group is Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2... But 6 is not a power of 2, so that's impossible. Similarly, characteristic 3 would require additive group Z_3 × Z_3, but 6 is not a power of 3. Therefore, no such additive group exists. This seems like the most straightforward argument, but it does require knowing that the additive group is an elementary abelian p-group, which is a result from the theory of vector spaces over the prime field. Since the user wants to avoid characteristics and such, maybe this is too advanced.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in any finite field, the number of elements is a power of a prime. But that's exactly the theorem they want to avoid. So perhaps an ad hoc argument for 6.\n\nLet’s suppose F is a field with 6 elements. Then the multiplicative group F* has 5 elements, which is a cyclic group of order 5. Let’s pick a generator a of F*. So the elements are 0,1,a,a²,a³,a⁴. Now, consider the element 1 +1. If 1+1=0, then the characteristic is 2. If 1+1 ≠0, then maybe the characteristic is 3. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, suppose the characteristic is 2. Then 1+1=0. Now, consider the element a +1. Since a ≠1, this is another element in the field. Let's compute (a +1)^5. Since the multiplicative order of a is 5, a^5=1. Using the binomial theorem in characteristic 2: (a +1)^5 = a^5 +1^5 =1 +1=0. So (a +1)^5=0, which implies a +1=0 (since in a field, the only nilpotent element is 0). But then a= -1, which in characteristic 2 is 1. But a≠1, contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, if characteristic is 3. Then 1+1+1=0. Compute (a +1)^5. Again, expand using binomial theorem in characteristic 3. But binomial coefficients might be more complicated. Alternatively, since a^5=1, but in additive characteristic 3, 3=0. Let's see, (a +1)^5 in characteristic 3. The coefficients are 1,5,10,10,5,1. Mod 3, these become 1,2,1,1,2,1. So (a +1)^5= a^5 +2a^4 +a³ +a² +2a +1. But a^5=1, so substituting: 1 +2a^4 +a³ +a² +2a +1= 2 +2a^4 +a³ +a² +2a. But in characteristic 3, 2 ≡ -1, so this becomes (-1) + (-1)a^4 +a³ +a² + (-1)a. But since F has additive inverses, but multiplicative group is cyclic of order 5. Not sure if this leads to a contradiction directly.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in characteristic 3, the additive order of 1 is 3. So 3*1=0. But the multiplicative group has order 5, which is coprime to 3. Maybe use the fact that the additive group must have exponent 3 (since char 3), so every element added to itself three times is 0. But the additive group has order 6, which is 3*2. The additive group would then be isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_2. But in such a group, there are elements of order 3 and elements of order 2. However, in a field of characteristic 3, the additive group must be a vector space over Z_3, hence its size must be 3^k. But 6 is not a power of 3, so impossible. So again, this leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, both possible characteristics lead to contradictions. Hence, no field of order 6 exists.\n\nBut how to present this in an elementary way? The key steps are:\n\n1. Assume F is a field with 6 elements.\n2. The multiplicative group F* has 5 elements, which is cyclic.\n3. The additive group must have prime characteristic (2 or 3).\n4. If characteristic 2, the additive group must have size 2^k, but 6 isn't a power of 2.\n5. If characteristic 3, the additive group must have size 3^k, but 6 isn't a power of 3.\n6. Therefore, impossible.\n\nBut step 4 and 5 rely on knowing that the additive structure is a vector space over the prime field, which might be more advanced. Alternatively, using the binomial theorem in characteristic 2 to derive a contradiction as in the earlier step where (a+1)^5=0 implies a+1=0, leading to a=1 which is a contradiction.\n\nSo for an elementary proof, perhaps the binomial theorem approach in characteristic 2 is better. Let's try to structure that.\n\nAssume F is a field with 6 elements. Then F* is cyclic of order 5. Let 1 ≠ a ∈ F*. Then a^5 =1. Consider 1+1 in F. If the characteristic is 2, then 1+1=0. Compute (1 +a)^5. Expand using binomial theorem:\n\n(1 +a)^5 =1 +5a +10a² +10a³ +5a⁴ +a^5.\n\nIn characteristic 2, coefficients modulo 2:\n\n1 +1a +0a² +0a³ +1a⁴ +1 = (1+1) +a +a⁴ =0 +a +a⁴.\n\nBut since in characteristic 2, (1+a)^5 must be equal to (1+a)^5 as an element of the field. But since F* is multiplicative order 5, (1+a)^5 =1 (because every non-zero element raised to 5th power is 1). Therefore:\n\na +a⁴ =1.\n\nSimilarly, consider another element, say a². Then (1 +a²)^5 =1 +a² +a⁸ +a^6 +a¹⁰ +a^10. But exponents modulo 5 since a^5=1:\n\na⁸ =a³, a^6 =a, a¹⁰ =a⁰=1. So:\n\n(1 +a²)^5 =1 +a² +a³ +a +1 = (1+1) +a +a² +a³ =0 +a +a² +a³.\n\nBut this must equal 1, so a +a² +a³ =1.\n\nBut earlier we had a +a⁴ =1. Therefore:\n\na +a⁴ =a +a² +a³ ⇒ a⁴ =a² +a³.\n\nBut since a^4 =a^{-1} (as a^5=1), then a^{-1}=a² +a³.\n\nBut multiply both sides by a:\n\n1 = a³ +a⁴.\n\nBut a⁴ =a² +a³ from above, so substituting:\n\n1 = a³ + (a² +a³) =a² +2a³. In characteristic 2, 2a³=0, so 1 =a². Then a²=1. But since a is a generator of F*, its order is 5, so a²≠1. Contradiction. Hence, no such field exists.\n\nThis seems like a more elementary argument using just binomial expansion and properties of exponents in the multiplicative group. It's a bit involved, but doesn't require advanced concepts like vector spaces or characteristics beyond knowing that 1+1=0 in characteristic 2. However, the user allows talking about characteristics if necessary, so maybe this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, a simpler argument: in any field, the multiplicative group is cyclic. If F has 6 elements, then F* has 5 elements, cyclic of order 5. The sum of all elements of F* is -1 (from Vieta's formula, since the product of all non-zero elements is -1 in a field). But in F, the sum of all elements is 0 (since additive inverse pairs cancel out, but since the additive group has even order, unless the characteristic is 2). Wait, this might not hold. Alternatively, consider that in the additive group, the sum of all elements is equal to the sum of F* plus 0. But in characteristic 2, the sum of all elements of F* would be 1 (since adding all elements in a vector space over Z_2 of dimension k, the sum is 0 if k ≥1, but here the additive group isn't a vector space because 6 isn't a power of 2). This line might not be helpful.\n\nOverall, the most elementary proof seems to be assuming there exists a field of 6 elements, considering its characteristic must be 2 or 3, then showing in each case the additive group can't have size 6 because it must be a vector space over the prime field, hence size p^k, which 6 isn't. Even though it uses characteristics and vector spaces, it's a concise argument. Since the user allows mentioning characteristics but prefers not to go into too much detail, this might be acceptable.\n\nSo, structuring the problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- There exists a field with 6 elements.\n- The multiplicative group of such a field would have 5 elements (so it's cyclic).\n- The characteristic of the field must be a prime (either 2 or 3).\n- If the characteristic is 2, the additive group must be a vector space over Z_2, hence size 2^k, but 6 isn't a power of 2.\n- Similarly for characteristic 3.\n\nBut the user wants the formatted problem section to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition to one object. So the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumptions:\n- There exists a field with 6 elements.\n- The multiplicative group of a field with 6 elements has 5 elements.\n- The characteristic of a field must be a prime number.\n- The additive group of a field with characteristic p is a vector space over the prime subfield of order p.\n- The order of a vector space over a finite field of order p must be a power of p.\n\nBut the user's example only lists the assumptions given in the problem, not the ones derived during the proof. Wait, looking back at the example provided:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user might have mistyped or filtered. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the user (the one creating the example) might have made a mistake. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to filter the original problem's assumptions. Maybe in the original problem, there was a mistake, but in any case, the task is to structure the given problem into Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFor the current problem about the field with 6 elements, the original question states that the students know Z_6 is not a field but wants to show no other field of size 6 exists. The problem is to prove there's no field with 6 elements. The assumptions would be any given conditions in the problem. However, the problem as posed doesn't list any specific assumptions besides the general properties of fields. The user's example included assumptions that were perhaps part of the problem statement. Here, the problem is standalone: \"Prove that there is no field with 6 elements.\" So in this case, the assumptions would be the properties inherent to the problem. But since the problem is to show no such field exists, the only assumption is that if such a field exists, it must satisfy field axioms. However, the user's example included specific assumptions from the problem, like n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the current problem, there are no such explicit assumptions given. Wait, the original problem on Math Stack Exchange is asking for an elementary proof that there is no field with 6 elements. The user (TA) wants to show students that even though Z_6 isn't a field, there's no other possible field of size 6. So the problem as stated is: \"Prove that there is no field with 6 elements.\" The assumptions here would be the basic properties of fields that are needed, but since the problem is self-contained, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the definition of a field. However, in the example provided, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem changed it to assuming n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. However, in this case, the current problem is to show no field of size 6 exists, which doesn't have additional assumptions. Therefore, maybe the assumptions section is left empty or with the basic field axioms. However, the example shows that sometimes they list assumptions from the problem. But in the current case, the problem is direct: prove there's no field with 6 elements. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nProblem: Prove that there is no field with 6 elements.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\". So in this case, perhaps the assumption is that we are considering a field with 6 elements. But the problem is to show such a field doesn't exist, so the assumption would be the contrary. But I think the user's example might have been incorrectly formatted. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. Since the problem is to show no field with 6 elements exists, the only assumption is that we are working within the axioms of field theory. But since the example included specific assumptions, maybe in this case, the assumption is:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a field with 6 elements.\n\nProblem: Derive a contradiction, thereby proving no such field exists.\n\nBut the example's formatting was to list the problem's given conditions as assumptions. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem's statement was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to modify the problem. Therefore, in the current task, perhaps the correct approach is to list the implicit assumptions needed to state the problem. However, the problem as posed doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the general field axioms. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nProblem: Prove that there is no field with 6 elements.\n\nBut maybe the assistant should consider that the problem is to show no field with 6 elements exists, hence the assumption is that such a field exists, leading to a contradiction. But according to the example, assumptions are the given conditions. So if the problem is \"Prove there is no field with 6 elements,\" the formatted problem would have no assumptions listed, but the example shows that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Hence, for consistency, perhaps here the assumption is simply:\n\nAssumption:\n- Consider a field with 6 elements.\n\nProblem: Show that such a field cannot exist.\n\nBut the example had assumptions as given conditions. So perhaps here, the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nProblem: Prove that there exists no field with 6 elements.\n\nGiven the example, maybe the assumptions are left empty, but according to the example, even if the original problem doesn't state assumptions, they are derived. But the example seems to have a mistake. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to follow the user's instruction: \"filter the unrelated information and structure that problem as the following format.\" The original question is asking to show there's no field of size 6, and the assumptions would be the properties inherent to the problem. However, since the problem is standalone, there are no specific assumptions beyond the general field axioms. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nProblem: Prove that there is no field with 6 elements.\n###\n\nBut the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't have them. Alternatively, maybe the assumption here is that the field has 6 elements. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- A field has 6 elements.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a field cannot exist.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be line by line, addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a field $F$ with exactly 6 elements.\n\nProblem: Show that this leads to a contradiction, hence no such field exists.\n\nBut the user's example didn't include the conclusion in the problem statement. The example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So following that, here the problem should be \"Prove that there is no field with 6 elements.\" The assumptions would be any conditions given, but since the problem is general, there are none. However, the user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption from the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So applying that logic here, the assumption would be that we are considering a field, which is a fundamental assumption, but since all fields have certain properties, maybe it's redundant. Given the ambiguity, I think the correct formatted problem based on the example is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nProblem: Prove that there is no field with 6 elements.\n###\n\nBut checking the example again, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", changing the original problem. This suggests that maybe the user wants to extract specific conditions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. However, in the current problem, there are no such conditions; it's a general proof. Therefore, the formatted problem should simply state the problem without assumptions. But the example included assumptions, so perhaps the assistant should list the properties inherent to the problem. Since the problem is about a field with 6 elements, the assumption is that such a field exists. But the problem is to disprove it. Maybe the assumption section is for any given conditions in the problem statement, but since the problem is to show nonexistence, there are no assumptions other than the contrary. This is confusing. Given the example's approach, which added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps the current task is to structure the problem as given, without adding assumptions. Hence, if the original problem is \"Prove that there is no field with 6 elements,\" then the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nProblem: Prove that there is no field with 6 elements.\n\nBut the example had assumptions even when the original problem didn't. Perhaps the user wants to list the inherent assumptions, like the field axioms. But that's too vague. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the problem statement as is.",
