    "Content": "Here is a problem so beautiful that I had to share it. I found it in Paul Halmos's autobiography. Everyone knows that $\\mathbb{C}$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$, but what about the other way around? Problem: Prove or disprove: $\\mathbb{R}$ can be written as vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$ Of course, we would like for $\\mathbb{R}$ to retain its structure as an additive group.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you want the additive vector space structure to be that of $\\mathbb{R}$, and you want the scalar multiplication, when restricted to $\\mathbb{R}$, to agree with multiplication of real numbers, then you cannot. That is, suppose you take $\\mathbb{R}$ as an abelian group, and you want to specify a \"scalar multiplication\" on $\\mathbb{C}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that makes it into a vector space, and in such a way that if $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is viewed as an element of $\\mathbb{C}$, then $\\alpha\\cdot v = \\alpha v$, where the left hand side is the scalar product we are defining, and the right hand side is the usual multiplication of real numbers. If such a thing existed, then the vector space structure would be completely determined by the value of $i\\cdot 1$: because for every nonzero real number $\\alpha$ and every complex number $a+bi$, we would have\n$$(a+bi)\\cdot\\alpha = a\\cdot \\alpha +b\\cdot(i\\cdot \\alpha) = a\\alpha + b(i\\cdot(\\alpha\\cdot 1)) = a\\alpha + b\\alpha(i\\cdot 1).$$\nBut say $i\\cdot 1 = r$. Then $(r-i)\\cdot 1 = 0$, which is contradicts the properties of a vector space, since $r-i\\neq 0$ and $1\\neq \\mathbf{0}$. So there is no such vector space structure. But if you are willing to make the scalar multiplication when restricted to $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$ to have nothing to do with the usual multiplication of real numbers, then you can indeed do it by transport of structure, as indicated by Chris Eagle.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition line by line, focusing on one property per line applied to one object. Then the problem is restated concisely.\n\nThe original problem here is asking whether ℝ is a vector space over ℂ. The question mentions that ℝ should retain its additive group structure. So the key points here are:\n\n1. The main objects involved are ℝ and ℂ.\n2. The problem is about verifying if ℝ can be a vector space over ℂ.\n3. The condition is that ℝ's additive group structure is preserved.\n\nNow, the assumptions. In the example, assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would relate to the properties required for a vector space. A vector space over a field requires two things: the scalars come from the field (here, ℂ), the vectors are from an abelian group (here, ℝ under addition), and the scalar multiplication must satisfy certain axioms (distributivity, compatibility, etc.). However, the problem states that ℝ should retain its additive group structure, so that's one assumption. The other main point is the scalar multiplication: since we're considering ℝ as the vector space over ℂ, the scalars would be complex numbers. But scalar multiplication typically requires the field (ℂ) to act on the vector space (ℝ). However, there's a problem here because ℝ is not naturally a module over ℂ unless certain conditions are met, which might not be possible. But the question is to prove or disprove this.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- ℝ is an additive group (retains its structure)\n- The scalar multiplication is defined from ℂ × ℝ to ℝ\n- The vector space axioms are satisfied with these operations.\n\nBut the user's example only lists explicit assumptions given in the problem. The original problem states: \"Prove or disprove: ℝ can be written as vector space over ℂ. Of course, we would like for ℝ to retain its structure as an additive group.\"\n\nSo the explicit assumptions here are:\n\n1. ℝ is considered as an additive group (so the addition operation is the usual one).\n2. We are to consider scalar multiplication where the field is ℂ and the vectors are in ℝ.\n3. The vector space axioms must be satisfied under these operations.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were directly taken from the problem statement. The original problem says \"retain its structure as an additive group,\" so that's one assumption. The other is that we're trying to make ℝ a vector space over ℂ. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- ℝ retains its structure as an additive group.\n- The scalar field is ℂ.\n\nBut the problem is to prove or disprove whether this is possible. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be the given conditions. The problem statement itself is \"Prove or disprove: ℝ can be written as a vector space over ℂ\" with the condition that ℝ's additive structure is kept.\n\nSo following the example's structure:\n\nAssumption:\nℝ retains its structure as an additive group.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that ℝ can be written as a vector space over ℂ.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included the condition on n (being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumption is that ℝ is an additive group (which it already is), but the problem is about defining a vector space structure over ℂ. However, maybe the key assumption is that the additive group structure of ℝ is preserved. So in the problem, that's a given condition.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nℝ retains its additive group structure.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that ℝ can be written as a vector space over ℂ.\n\nThat seems to fit the example's structure. Each assumption is one line. The first line states that the additive group structure of ℝ is maintained. The problem is then to check if such a vector space structure exists over ℂ.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example had two assumptions for the problem, but here there's only one explicit assumption given in the problem statement. The rest is part of the problem's setup. So the answer should follow this.",
