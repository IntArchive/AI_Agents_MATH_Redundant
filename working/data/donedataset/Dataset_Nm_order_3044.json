    "AcceptedAnswer": "By the end of this post, we shall prove a more general result: Theorem: Let $a, b, c, d$ be real numbers such that $0<a<b \\leq c<d$. Then the equation $$a^x+d^x=b^x+c^x$$ has Exactly two solutions, $x=0$ and $x=t>0$ for some $t$, if $ad-bc<0$ Exactly two solutions, $x=0$ and $x=t<0$ for some $t$, if $ad-bc>0$ Exactly one solution, $x=0$, if $ad-bc=0$ We first prove the following lemma: Lemma $1$: Suppose that $f(x)$ is a function with the following properties: $f(x)$ is $k$ times differentiable For $i=0, 1, \\ldots, k-1$, we have $f^{(i)}(0) \\leq 0$  and $f^{(i)}(x)>0$ for all sufficiently large $x$. $f^{(k)}(x)$ has at most one positive real root. Then $f(x)$ has at most one positive real root. Proof: We prove by induction on $n$, $0 \\leq n \\leq k$, that $f^{(k-n)}(x)$ has at most one positive real root. When $n=0$, this follows from the given conditions. Suppose that the statement holds for $n=j \\leq k-1$, i.e. $f^{(k-j)}(x)$ has at most one positive real root. Assume on the contrary that $f^{(k-j-1)}(x)$ has at least two positive real roots. Suppose that $u, v$ are positive real roots of $f^{(k-j-1)}(x)$ with $0<u<v$. By Rolle's theorem applied to $f^{(k-j-1)}(u)=f^{(k-j-1)}(v)=0$, $f^{(k-j)}(s)=0$ for some $s \\in (u, v)$. We now consider three cases: Case $1$ : $f^{(k-j-1)}(s)=0$ By Rolle's theorem applied to $f^{(k-j-1)}(u)=f^{(k-j-1)}(s)$, we have $f^{(k-j)}(t)=0$ for some $t \\in (u, s)$. Clearly $t \\not =s$. Therefore $f^{(k-j)}(x)$ has at least two positive real roots $s, t$, contradicting the induction hypothesis. Case $2$: $f^{(k-j-1)}(s)>0$ Note that $f^{(k-j-1)}(x)$ is positive for sufficiently large $x$, so in particular, $f^{(k-j-1)}(w)>0$ for some $w>v$. Clearly there exists $\\delta>0$ s.t. $$0<\\delta<\\min(f^{(k-j-1)}(s),f^{(k-j-1)}(w))$$ Now by Intermediate Value Theorem applied to $[s, v]$ and $[v, w]$, there exists $u_1, v_1$ with $u<s<u_1<v<v_1<w$ and $$f^{(k-j-1)}(u_1)=f^{(k-j-1)}(v_1)=\\delta$$ By Rolle's theorem, we now get $f^{(k-j)}(t)=0$ for  some $t \\in (u_1, v_1)$. It is clear that $t \\not =s$. Therefore $f^{(k-j)}(x)$ has at least two positive real roots $s, t$, contradicting the induction hypothesis. Case $3$: $f^{(k-j-1)}(s)<0$ We have $f^{(k-j-1)}(0) \\leq 0$. Case 3a) $f^{(k-j-1)}(0)<0$ Clearly there exists $\\delta<0$ s.t. $$\\max(f^{(k-j-1)}(s),f^{(k-j-1)}(0))<\\delta<0$$ Now by Intermediate Value Theorem applied to $[0, u]$ and $[u, s]$, there exists $u_1, v_1$ with $0<u_1<u<v_1<s<v$ and $$f^{(k-j-1)}(u_1)=f^{(k-j-1)}(v_1)=\\delta$$ By Rolle's theorem, we now get $f^{(k-j)}(t)=0$ for  some $t \\in (u_1, v_1)$. It is clear that $t \\not =s$. Therefore $f^{(k-j)}(x)$ has at least two positive real roots $s, t$, contradicting the induction hypothesis. Case 3b) $f^{(k-j-1)}(0)=0$ By Rolle's theorem applied to $[0, u]$, we now get $f^{(k-j)}(t)=0$ for  some $t \\in (0, u)$. It is clear that $t \\not =s$. Therefore $f^{(k-j)}(x)$ has at least two positive real roots $s, t$, contradicting the induction hypothesis. Therefore we get a contradiction in all three cases, so $f^{(k-j-1)}(x)$ has at most one positive real root. We are thus done by induction, so $f^{(k-n)}(x)=0$ has at most one positive real root for $n=0, 1, \\ldots , k$. In particular, setting $n=k$ gives that $f(x)$ has at most one positive real root, as desired. Lemma $2$: Let $p, q, r$ be real numbers such that $1<p \\leq q<r$. Then the equation $$1+r^x=p^x+q^x$$ has No positive real solutions if $r \\geq pq$ Exactly one positive real solution if $r<pq$ Proof: If $r \\geq pq$, then for $x>0$ we have $$1+r^x-p^x-q^x \\geq 1+(pq)^x-p^x-q^x=(p^x-1)(q^x-1)>0$$ so indeed there are no positive real solutions. If $r<pq$, let $$f(x)=1+r^x-p^x-q^x$$ Note that for $n \\geq 1$ we have $$f^{(n)}(x)=(\\log r)^nr^x-(\\log p)^np^x-(\\log q)^nq^x$$ We have $$\\lim_{x \\to 0+}{\\frac{f(x)}{x}}=f'(0)=\\log r-\\log p-\\log q<0$$ Thus $\\exists u>0$ s.t. $f(u)<0$. On the other hand, clearly $f(x)$ is positive for sufficiently large $x$, so $\\exists v>u$ s.t. $f(v)>0$. Since $f(x)$ is continuous, we may conclude using the Intermediate Value Theorem that $f(x)$ has a positive real root. We now show that $f(x)$ has at most one positive real root. Consider $$g(y)=(\\log r)^y-(\\log p)^y-(\\log q)^y$$ It is clear that $g(y)$ is non-negative for sufficiently large $y$, so there exists $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ s.t. $g(k) \\geq 0$. Take the minimal such $k$, so $g(i)<0$ for $i=1, 2, \\ldots ,k-1$. We have $f^{(i)}(0)=g(i)<0$ for $i=1, 2, \\ldots , k-1$, and $f(0)=0$. For $i=0, 1,  \\ldots k-1$, we clearly have $f^{(i)}(x)>0$ for sufficiently large $x$. Now for $x>0$ we have \\begin{align}\nf^{(k)}(x)& =(\\log r)^kr^x-(\\log p)^kp^x-(\\log q)^kq^x \\\\\n& \\geq \\left((\\log p)^k+(\\log q)^k\\right)r^x-(\\log p)^kp^x-(\\log q)^kq^x \\\\\n&=(\\log p)^k(r^x-p^x)+(\\log q)^k(r^x-q^x) \\\\\n&>0\n\\end{align} Thus $f^{(k)}(x)$ has no positive real roots. By Lemma $1$, we conclude that $f(x)$ has at most one positive real root. Therefore when $r<pq$, we have exactly one positive real solution. This concludes the proof of the lemma. We now proceed to prove the main theorem: Theorem: Let $a, b, c, d$ be real numbers such that $0<a<b \\leq c<d$. Then the equation $$a^x+d^x=b^x+c^x$$ has Exactly two solutions, $x=0$ and $x=t>0$ for some $t$, if $ad-bc<0$ Exactly two solutions, $x=0$ and $x=t<0$ for some $t$, if $ad-bc>0$ Exactly one solution, $x=0$, if $ad-bc=0$ Proof: Clearly $x=0$ is always a solution. For $x>0$, we may rewrite the equation as $$1+\\left(\\frac{d}{a}\\right)^x=\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^x+\\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)^x$$ We may now take $p=\\frac{b}{a}, q=\\frac{c}{a}, r=\\frac{d}{a}$ and use Lemma $2$ to get that there are No positive real solutions (for $x$) if $\\frac{d}{a} \\geq \\frac{bc}{a^2}$, i.e. $ad \\geq bc$ Exactly one positive real solution (for $x$) if $\\frac{d}{a}<\\frac{bc}{a^2}$, i.e. $ad<bc$ For $x<0$, we may take $y=-x$ and rewrite the equation as $$\\left(\\frac{a}{d}\\right)^x+1=\\left(\\frac{b}{d}\\right)^x+\\left(\\frac{c}{d}\\right)^x$$ $$1+\\left(\\frac{d}{a}\\right)^y=\\left(\\frac{d}{b}\\right)^y+\\left(\\frac{d}{c}\\right)^y$$ We may now apply Lemma $2$ with $p=\\frac{d}{c}, q=\\frac{d}{b}, r=\\frac{d}{a}$ and $y$ as the variable to get No positive real solutions (for $y$) if $\\frac{d}{a} \\geq \\frac{d^2}{bc}$, i.e. $bc \\geq ad$ Exactly one positive real solution (for $y$) if $\\frac{d}{a}<\\frac{d^2}{bc}$, i.e. $bc<ad$ This translates to No negative real solutions (for $x$) if $bc \\geq ad$ Exactly one negative real solution (for $x$) if $bc<ad$ Combining, we get the statement of the theorem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this equation: 3^x + 28^x = 8^x + 27^x. The user says the solutions are x=0 and x=2, and wants to prove those are the only ones. Hmm. First, I should check if those are indeed solutions. Let's plug in x=0: 3^0 + 28^0 = 1 + 1 = 2, and 8^0 + 27^0 = 1 + 1 = 2. So that works. For x=2: 9 + 784 = 793, and 64 + 729 = 793. Yep, that's correct. Now, are there other solutions?\n\nMaybe negative x? Let's try x=-1. 3^-1 is 1/3, 28^-1 is 1/28, 8^-1 is 1/8, 27^-1 is 1/27. So 1/3 + 1/28 ≈ 0.333 + 0.0357 ≈ 0.3687, and 1/8 + 1/27 ≈ 0.125 + 0.037 ≈ 0.162. So left side is bigger. Maybe x=1: 3 + 28 = 31, 8 + 27 = 35. Right side is bigger here. So between x=0 and x=2, maybe there's another solution? Wait, at x=1, right side is bigger. At x=0, they are equal. At x=2, equal again. How does the function behave between these points?\n\nLet me define f(x) = 3^x + 28^x - 8^x - 27^x. We need to find where f(x) = 0. Let's analyze the behavior of f(x). For x approaching negative infinity: 28^x and 27^x go to zero, so f(x) ≈ 3^x - 8^x. Since 3 < 8, 3^x dominates when x is negative (because 3^-inf is larger than 8^-inf), so f(x) approaches positive infinity? Wait, no. Let me think: for x negative, 3^x = 1/3^|x|, and 8^x = 1/8^|x|. So 3^x > 8^x when x is negative, so f(x) ≈ 3^x -8^x + 28^x -27^x. But 28^x and 27^x are both very small, so f(x) ≈ positive term. So as x→-infty, f(x) approaches 0 but from positive side?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's compute for x very negative. Suppose x = -1000. Then 3^x is 1/(3^1000), 28^x is 1/(28^1000), etc. Since 28 is the largest base, 28^x is the smallest term. So 3^x and 8^x and 27^x. 3^x is bigger than 8^x, so f(x) ≈ 3^x -8^x -27^x. But 27^x is larger than 8^x when x is negative? Wait, no, 27 is bigger than 8, so 27^x when x is negative is 1/27^|x|, which is smaller than 8^x=1/8^|x|. Wait, no: if base is bigger, then base^x for negative x is smaller. So 27^x =1/27^|x| is smaller than 8^x=1/8^|x|. So for x→-infty, 3^x is 1/3^|x|, which is bigger than 8^x and 27^x. So f(x) ≈ 3^x + 28^x -8^x -27^x ≈ 3^x (since others are negligible). So f(x) approaches 0 from positive side as x→-infty.\n\nAt x=0, f(x)=0. At x=1, f(1)=3 +28 -8 -27= -4. So f(1)=-4. At x=2, f(2)=9 +784 -64 -729=0. Then, what about x>2? Let's check x=3: 27 + 28^3 vs 512 + 27^3. 28^3=21952, 27^3=19683. So left side: 27 +21952=21979. Right side:512 +19683=20195. So 21979 -20195=1784. So f(3)=1784>0. So f(3) is positive. So f(2)=0, f(3)=1784>0. What about x=4? 81 + 28^4 vs 8^4 +27^4. 28^4=28*28*28*28=614656, 27^4=531441, 8^4=4096. Left:81 +614656=614737. Right:4096 +531441=535537. So f(4)=614737 -535537=79200>0. So f(x) is increasing after x=2.\n\nSo between x=2 and higher x, f(x) is positive. Between x=1 and x=2, at x=1, f(x)=-4, at x=2, 0. So it goes from -4 to 0. So maybe there's a root at x=2. But the user claims x=2 and x=0 are the only solutions. Wait, but between x=0 and x=2, f(x) goes from 0 at x=0 to -4 at x=1, then back to 0 at x=2. So maybe there's another root between x=1 and x=2? Wait, but f(1)=-4 and f(2)=0. So it goes from -4 to 0, which would cross zero only once? Wait, but maybe not. Wait, but how does it behave? Let's check at x=1.5. Let's compute f(1.5):\n\n3^1.5 ≈ sqrt(3^3) = sqrt(27) ≈5.196,\n\n28^1.5 = sqrt(28^3) = sqrt(21952) ≈ 148.16,\n\n8^1.5 = sqrt(8^3)=sqrt(512)=22.627,\n\n27^1.5=sqrt(27^3)=sqrt(19683)=140.29.\n\nSo f(1.5)=5.196 +148.16 -22.627 -140.29 ≈ (5.196 +148.16) - (22.627 +140.29) ≈153.356 -162.917≈-9.561. So f(1.5)≈-9.56. At x=1.5, it's more negative. Then at x=2, it's 0. So from x=1.5 to x=2, it goes from -9.56 to 0. So it's increasing. So maybe only one root at x=2. Wait, but from x=1.5 to x=2, f increases from -9.56 to 0, so crosses zero once. But from x=1 to x=1.5, it goes from -4 to -9.56, so decreasing. At x=0, f=0. At x approaching negative infinity, f approaches 0 from positive. So between x=-infty and x=0, f(x) is positive? Wait, at x=0, f=0. For x negative, let's pick x=-1: f(-1)=1/3 +1/28 -1/8 -1/27≈0.333 +0.0357 -0.125 -0.037≈0.2067>0. So f(-1)≈0.2067>0. So f(x) is positive for x<0, decreases from x=-infty to x=0, where it hits zero. Then, for x>0, at x=0, f=0. At x=1, f=-4. Then at x=2, f=0. Then for x>2, f increases to positive infinity. So the graph crosses zero at x=0, x=2, and maybe another crossing between x=1 and x=2? Wait, but f(x) at x=1 is -4, at x=2 is 0. If the function is increasing from x=1 to x=2, then it only crosses zero once at x=2. Wait, but at x=1.5, it's -9.56, which is even lower. Wait, so from x=1 to x=1.5, f(x) decreases from -4 to -9.56, then increases from x=1.5 to x=2 back to 0. So there's a minimum somewhere between x=1 and x=2. Hence, the function crosses zero at x=0, then goes negative, reaches a minimum, then comes back to zero at x=2. So between x=0 and x=2, the function starts at zero, goes negative, then back to zero. So there's another crossing at x=2. Wait, but does it cross zero in between? If it starts at zero, goes negative, then returns to zero at x=2, but in between, it doesn't cross zero again, unless there's a oscillation. Wait, maybe the function is convex or concave. Let's compute the derivative to see the behavior.\n\nCompute f'(x)=ln(3)*3^x + ln(28)*28^x - ln(8)*8^x - ln(27)*27^x.\n\nAt x=0: f'(0)= ln(3)+ln(28)-ln(8)-ln(27)= ln(3*28/(8*27))= ln(84/216)= ln(7/18)≈ negative. So derivative at x=0 is negative, meaning function is decreasing at x=0. So after x=0, it decreases to x=1 (f=-4), then continues decreasing until a minimum point, then increases back to zero at x=2. So there's only one crossing at x=2. So between x=0 and x=2, the function starts at zero, goes down, then up to zero again. So there are two solutions: x=0 and x=2. But wait, x=0 is a solution, then the function dips below and comes back to zero at x=2. So no other crossings. So those are the only solutions.\n\nBut how to prove this rigorously? Maybe using the intermediate value theorem and monotonicity. Alternatively, perhaps using the convexity or concavity of the function. Or maybe considering the function f(x) = 28^x -27^x +3^x -8^x. Let's see if we can factor or compare terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 28 and 27 are close, as are 8 and 3. Maybe writing 28^x -27^x = 27^x*( (28/27)^x -1 ) and similarly 3^x -8^x=8^x*( (3/8)^x -1 ). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for x>2, 28^x grows faster than 27^x, and 3^x is negligible compared to 28^x, so f(x) is positive and increasing. For x<0, as discussed, f(x) is positive. Between x=0 and x=2, the function dips below zero and comes back. To show that there's only one crossing at x=2, need to show that f(x) has only one root in x>0, which is at x=2. Perhaps by showing that f(x) is convex or concave, and has at most two roots. But since we know x=0 and x=2 are roots, maybe that's all.\n\nAlternatively, divide both sides by 27^x:\n\n(3/27)^x + (28/27)^x = (8/27)^x +1.\n\nSimplify: (1/9)^x + (28/27)^x = (8/27)^x +1.\n\nLet’s set t = x, and see if we can analyze the function g(t) = (1/9)^t + (28/27)^t - (8/27)^t -1.\n\nWe need to show g(t)=0 has solutions at t=0 and t=2. For t>0, maybe analyze the derivative of g(t). Compute g’(t) = ln(1/9)(1/9)^t + ln(28/27)(28/27)^t - ln(8/27)(8/27)^t.\n\nNot sure if this helps. Alternatively, consider substituting t=2 as the only positive solution.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the equation might be symmetric in some way. Let me check x=2: 3^2 +28^2=9+784=793. 8^2+27^2=64+729=793. So it works. Is there a reason why x=2 works? Maybe because 3+27=30 and 8+28=36, but not sure. Alternatively, 28-27=1 and 8-3=5. Doesn't seem obvious.\n\nAnother approach: suppose x>2. We can write 28^x -27^x =8^x -3^x. Since 28>27, the left side is positive. The right side: 8^x -3^x is also positive for x>0. So equality occurs when the growth rates balance. For large x, 28^x dominates, so left side grows faster, so equality only at x=2.\n\nFor 0<x<2, we have 28^x -27^x <8^x -3^x. At x=0, both sides are 0. At x=2, equality. Between x=0 and x=2, the left side increases from 0 to 28^2 -27^2= (28-27)(28+27)=1*55=55. The right side increases from 0 to 8^2 -3^2=64-9=55. So both sides reach 55 at x=2. But how do they compare in between? Let’s take x=1: left side=28-27=1, right side=8-3=5. So 1<5. So at x=1, left side < right side. So the function f(x)= left - right is negative. At x=0, 0. At x=2, 0. So the function crosses zero at x=0 and x=2. Between x=0 and x=2, it's negative. Hence, only two solutions.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Maybe by considering the function h(x)=28^x -27^x -8^x +3^x. We need to show h(x)=0 only at x=0 and x=2.\n\nAlternatively, consider the difference as a function and analyze its derivatives. Compute h’(x)=ln(28)28^x -ln(27)27^x -ln(8)8^x +ln(3)3^x.\n\nAt x=0, h’(0)= ln(28) -ln(27) -ln(8)+ln(3)= ln(28/27) - ln(8/3)= ln((28/27)/(8/3))= ln((28/27)*(3/8))= ln(28*3 /27*8)= ln(84/216)= ln(7/18)≈ negative. So h(x) is decreasing at x=0.\n\nAt x=2, compute h’(2): ln(28)*28^2 -ln(27)*27^2 -ln(8)*8^2 +ln(3)*3^2. Let's approximate:\n\n28^2=784, 27^2=729, 8^2=64, 3^2=9.\n\nSo terms:\n\nln(28)*784 ≈ 3.332*784 ≈2617.7\n\nln(27)*729≈3.296*729≈2403.4\n\nln(8)*64≈2.079*64≈133.0\n\nln(3)*9≈1.0986*9≈9.888\n\nSo total h’(2)≈2617.7 -2403.4 -133.0 +9.888≈(2617.7 -2403.4)=214.3; then 214.3 -133.0=81.3 +9.888≈91.188>0. So h’(2) is positive. So the derivative at x=2 is positive. Therefore, h(x) has a minimum somewhere between x=0 and x=2, since the derivative goes from negative to positive. Hence, the function h(x) is convex in this interval, having a single minimum. Since h(0)=0 and h(2)=0, and it dips below zero in between, there are exactly two roots: x=0 and x=2. For x>2, since h’(2)>0 and h(x) increases to infinity, no other roots. For x<0, h(x) is positive, as we saw earlier. Thus, the only solutions are x=0 and x=2.\n\nTherefore, to prove this, one can analyze the function's behavior, show it's decreasing then increasing with only two zeros, using calculus and the intermediate value theorem. Alternatively, maybe there's an algebraic approach, but given the exponents, calculus seems necessary.",
