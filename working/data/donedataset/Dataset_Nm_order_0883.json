    "Content": "I know that $$\\int^\\infty_0\\frac x{e^x-1}dx=\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$ For substituting $u=2$ into $$\\zeta(u)\\Gamma(u)=\\int^\\infty_0\\frac{x^{u-1}}{e^x-1}dx$$ However, I suspect that there is an easier proof, maybe by the use of complex analysis. I haven't learnt the zeta function yet. All I know is the above formula and $\\zeta(2)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$. Can we can use the above integral to find out some of the $\\zeta$'s value?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "UPDATED You may indeed use contour integration as nicely exposed in Ablowitz and Fokas  \"Complex Variables\" p. $244$ . The idea is to evaluate $\\;\\displaystyle I(p):=PV \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac {e^{px}}{1-e^x}dx,\\quad(0<p<1)\\quad$ using the contour : The integrals at the right and left side vanish as $R\\to +\\infty$ and the four bottom and top horizontal lines will add the contribution : $$\\left(\\int_{-R}^{-\\epsilon_1}+\\int_{\\epsilon_1}^R\\right)\\frac{e^{px}}{1-e^x}dx+e^{2\\pi ip}\\left(\\int_{R}^{-\\epsilon_2}+\\int_{\\epsilon_2}^{-R}\\right)\\frac{e^{px}}{1-e^x}dx$$ that is (as $\\;R\\to +\\infty$ and $\\epsilon_i\\to 0$ ) : $$\\tag{1}\\left(1-e^{2\\pi ip}\\right)PV \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{e^{px}}{1-e^x}dx$$ while the semi-circular contours will give, as $\\epsilon_1 \\to 0^+$ and $\\epsilon_2 \\to 0^+$ : \\begin{align}\n\\tag{2}\\lim_{\\epsilon_1\\to 0}\\int_{C\\epsilon_1}\\frac{e^{pz}}{1-e^z}dz&=-i\\pi\\left(\\frac{e^{pz}}{-e^z}\\right)_{z=0}=i\\pi\\\\\n\\tag{3}\\lim_{\\epsilon_2\\to 0}\\int_{C\\epsilon_2}\\frac{e^{pz}}{1-e^z}dz&=-i\\pi\\left(\\frac{e^{pz}}{-e^z}\\right)_{z=2\\pi i}=i\\pi\\,e^{2\\pi i p}\\\\\n\\end{align} Since no singularity appears in its inside the whole contour will have an integral of value $0$ equal to the sum of $(1),\\;(2)$ and $(3)$ . This gives : $$I(p)=PV \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac {e^{px}}{1-e^x}dx=-i\\pi \\frac{1+\\,e^{2\\pi i p}}{1-\\,e^{2\\pi i p}}$$ or simply : $$\\tag{4} \\boxed{\\displaystyle I(p)=\\pi \\cot( \\pi p)}$$ Now $(4)$ multiplied by $p$ should give Euler's generating function for $\\zeta($ even $)$ : $$\\tag{5}\\displaystyle\\pi\\;p\\;\\cot(\\pi\\;p)=1-2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\zeta(2n)\\;p^{2n}$$ which allows to find $\\zeta(2n)$ just by using the expansion of $\\pi\\,x\\;\\cot(\\pi\\,x)$ : $$\\tag{6}\\pi\\,x\\;\\cot(\\pi\\,x)=1-2\\left(\\frac {\\pi^2}6x^2+\\frac{\\pi^4}{90}x^4+\\frac{\\pi^6}{945}x^6+\\cdots\\right)$$ Since we had an integral from $0$ to $+\\infty$ and not a Cauchy principal value from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ it will be convenient to  rewrite $I(p)$ as : \\begin{align}\n\\tag{7}I(p)-\\frac 1p&=\\pi \\cot( \\pi p)-\\frac 1p=-2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\zeta(2n)\\;p^{2n-1}\\\\ \n&=PV \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac {e^{px}}{1-e^x}dx-\\int_0^\\infty e^{-px}dx\\\\\n&=\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\int_{\\epsilon}^\\infty \\frac {e^{px}}{1-e^x}-e^{-px}dx+\\int_{-\\infty}^{-\\epsilon} \\frac {e^{py}}{1-e^y}dy\\\\\n(\\text{setting}\\;\\;y:=-x)\\;\\\\\n&=\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\int_{\\epsilon}^\\infty \\frac {e^{px}}{1-e^x}-e^{-px}+\\frac {e^{-px}e^x}{(1-e^{-x})e^x}dx\\\\\n&=\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\int_{\\epsilon}^\\infty \\frac {e^{px}}{1-e^x}+\\frac {e^{-px}e^x-e^{-px}(e^x-1)}{e^x-1}dx\\\\\n\\end{align} with the neat result : $$\\tag{8}\\boxed{\\displaystyle I(p)-\\frac 1p= \\int_0^\\infty \\frac {e^{px}-e^{-px}}{1-e^x}dx}$$ This integral may be used to obtain the coefficients of $p^{2n-1}$ in $(7)$ since : $$\\left(\\frac d{dp}\\right)^{2n-1} \\left(I(p)-\\frac 1p\\right)=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac {x^{2n-1}\\left(e^{px}+e^{-px}\\right)}{1-e^x}dx$$ with the limit as $p\\to 0$ given by : $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac {x^{2n-1}\\;2}{1-e^x}dx=-2\\,(2n-1)!\\,\\zeta(2n)$$ corresponding to the classical formula for $n$ positive integer : $$\\tag{9}\\zeta(2n)\\Gamma(2n)=\\int^\\infty_0\\frac{x^{2n-1}}{e^x-1}dx$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of x divided by (e^x minus 1) dx equals pi squared over 6. They mentioned knowing that zeta(u) times Gamma(u) equals the integral from 0 to infinity of x^(u-1)/(e^x -1) dx, and substituting u=2 gives the result. But they suspect there's an easier proof, possibly using complex analysis, and they don't know much about the zeta function beyond zeta(2) being pi²/6. So the task is to present the problem in the required format.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The original problem states the integral equals pi²/6. The user mentions substituting u=2 into the relation involving zeta, Gamma, and the integral. However, they want an alternative proof. So the assumptions here would include that the integral is from 0 to infinity, the integrand is x/(e^x -1), and the known result zeta(2) = pi²/6. Wait, but the user is asking for a proof that doesn't rely on deeper zeta function knowledge. So maybe the key assumptions are about the integral's form and the known value of zeta(2). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to use the given integral expression for zeta(u)Gamma(u) and the known value of zeta(2) to find the integral. But the user wants an alternative method. However, the problem statement as given is to prove the integral equals pi²/6. So the assumptions would be the integral's limits and integrand. Let me structure that.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is x/(e^x -1).\n- ζ(2) = π²/6 (since they know that and might need it for the proof).\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement is just to prove the integral equals pi²/6. The user's question includes that they know ζ(2) = π²/6 and the integral relation involving zeta and Gamma functions. However, in the problem as presented, maybe the key assumptions are just about the integral's structure. The user's knowledge of ζ(2) might be a hint but not an assumption of the problem itself. The problem is to prove the integral equals pi²/6. So perhaps the only assumptions are the integral's form and limits. The rest is part of the problem's context but not the problem's own assumptions.\n\nWait, looking back at the example given: the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, that was listed as an assumption. But in the original problem here, the user is asking to prove the integral equals pi²/6. The user's own knowledge includes ζ(2) = pi²/6 and the integral expression for zeta(u)Gamma(u). But the problem as stated is just to prove the integral, so the assumptions would be the integral's setup. However, the user mentions substituting u=2 into the zeta-Gamma integral relation. So maybe the problem's assumptions include that relation? Or is that part of the context?\n\nThe example given by the user had the original problem mentioning \"for every integer n\" but then the formatted problem included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check. The original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted version, the assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Because the original problem didn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. Therefore, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to include any conditions mentioned in the problem, even if they are general. So in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to infinity, integrand x/(e^x -1), and the problem is to prove it's equal to pi²/6. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is x/(e^x -1).\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ x/(e^x -1) dx = π²/6.\n\nBut the user also mentions knowing that ζ(2) = π²/6 and the integral expression for ζ(u)Γ(u). However, since the problem is to prove the integral equals π²/6, maybe the problem's assumptions don't include ζ(2) = π²/6, because that's part of what needs to be connected. Wait, but the user says they know ζ(2) = π²/6 and asks if they can use the integral to find ζ's value. So perhaps the problem is using the integral to find ζ(2), which is known to be π²/6. So maybe the problem is to show that the integral equals ζ(2), given that ζ(2) = π²/6. But the problem as stated is to prove the integral equals π²/6. The user is asking for a way to do this without deeper zeta function knowledge. Therefore, the assumptions would include the integral expression for ζ(u)Γ(u), but the problem is to prove the integral equals π²/6. However, in the problem statement, the user hasn't included the Γ function relation as part of the problem; they mentioned it in their question. So perhaps the problem is simply to prove the integral equals π²/6, with the assumptions being the integral's form. The rest is context. So, to follow the format, the assumptions are the integral's limits and integrand. The problem is to prove it equals π²/6.",
