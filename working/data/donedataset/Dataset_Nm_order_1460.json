    "Content": "Just for fun (inspired by sub-problem described and answered here ): Let's pick three points on a circle, say $A,B,C$. Move one point ($A$ for example) until the triangle becomes isosceles ($A'BC$) with all angles acute: Now we have triangle with sides $AB$ and $AC$ equal. Pick any of the two, say $AC$ and move $B$ until the triangle becomes isosceles again, with all angles acute: Now we have a triangle with sides $AB$ and $BC$ equal. Pick any of the two, say $BC$ and move $A$ until the triangle becomes isosceles again, with all angles acute: Repeate the same process infinite number of times. Can we prove that the end result is always an equilateral triangle? It looks so but I might be wrong. I have checked several initial configurations and always ended up with something looking like an equilateral triangle.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Think about what happens to the maximum difference between angles over time. For simplicity, let's start with an isoceles triangle with angles $x,y,y$. This triangle has \"maximum angle difference\" $\\vert y-x\\vert$. Then when we move one of the $y$-angled points, our new triangle will have angles $$y, {x+y\\over 2}, {x+y\\over 2}$$ since the angle of the point being moved doesn't change.The maximum difference of angles in this new triangle is $$\\left\\vert {y\\over 2}-{x\\over 2}\\right\\vert={1\\over 2}\\vert y-x\\vert.$$ So each time we perform this transformation, the maximum angle difference goes down by a factor of two. Whatever the initial value $\\vert y-x\\vert$ was, this means that the maximum angle difference goes to zero,$^*$ which in turn means that in the limit the angles are equal. $^*$This is because it's a geometric sequence with ratio in $(-1,1)$ (namely, ${1\\over 2}$) : if $r\\in(-1,1)$ then for any $a$ we have $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}ar^n=0.$$ Note that it would not have been enough to simply know that the maximum angle difference decreases, since not every decreasing sequence goes to zero!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is talking about a construction process on a circle where you repeatedly adjust points to form isosceles triangles with all angles acute, and after an infinite number of steps, they want to know if the result is always an equilateral triangle. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions starting with three points on a circle, A, B, C. Then moving point A until triangle A'BC is isosceles with all angles acute. Then picking another side, moving a different point, and repeating this process infinitely. \n\nSo the assumptions here are: \n\n1. The initial points A, B, C are on a circle. \n2. At each step, one vertex is moved along the circle to form an isosceles triangle. Wait, but the problem says \"Move one point (A for example) until the triangle becomes isosceles (A'BC) with all angles acute.\" So each time you move a point until the triangle becomes isosceles and all angles are acute. Then you pick another side and move another point similarly. \n\nSo each step involves selecting a vertex, moving it along the circle to create an isosceles triangle with all acute angles. The process is repeated infinitely. \n\nPossible assumptions:\n\n- The process is iterative, alternating which vertex is moved. But the problem says \"Pick any of the two, say AC and move B...\" So the choice of which vertex to move next isn't fixed; you can pick either of the two equal sides and then move the opposite vertex. But the problem states \"Pick any of the two, say BC and move A...\" So each step after creating an isosceles triangle, you pick one of the two equal sides and move the opposite vertex to make another isosceles triangle with all angles acute. \n\nSo perhaps the specific rule is that after each move, you have an isosceles triangle, then you choose one of the two equal sides and move the opposite vertex again. But the problem doesn't specify the exact order, just that you repeat the process. However, the user mentions that in the example, they start by moving A, then B, then A, etc. But in the problem statement, the exact sequence isn't fixed; the user can choose which vertex to move next each time as long as it's the opposite vertex of one of the two equal sides. \n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. Initial triangle is formed by three points on a circle.\n2. Each step involves moving one vertex along the circle to form an isosceles triangle with all angles acute.\n3. The vertex moved is the one opposite to one of the two equal sides of the current isosceles triangle.\n4. This process is repeated infinitely.\n\nThe problem is to determine if the limit of this infinite process is always an equilateral triangle, regardless of the initial configuration and the choices made at each step.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Can we prove that the end result is always an equilateral triangle? It looks so but I might be wrong...\" So the problem is whether, regardless of the initial configuration and the choices made at each step (i.e., which vertex to move next), the limit after infinitely many steps is an equilateral triangle.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- The construction starts with three points on a circle forming a triangle (not necessarily specified as isosceles or equilateral initially).\n- At each step, one vertex is moved along the circle to form an isosceles triangle with all acute angles.\n- The choice of which vertex to move at each step is arbitrary (as per \"Pick any of the two...\").\n- The process is repeated infinitely.\n\nSo now, to structure the assumptions line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial points $A$, $B$, $C$ lie on a circle.\n- At each step, one vertex is moved along the circle.\n- After each move, the triangle becomes isosceles with all angles acute.\n- The moved vertex is the one opposite to one of the two equal sides of the current triangle.\n- The process is repeated infinitely.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of this infinite process is an equilateral triangle.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"the end result is always an equilateral triangle\". So perhaps the problem is to show that, regardless of the choices made at each step (which vertex to move), the limit is equilateral.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- $A$, $B$, $C$ are initially three distinct points on a circle.\n- At each step, a vertex is moved along the circle to form an isosceles triangle with all acute angles.\n- The moved vertex is opposite to a chosen equal side of the current isosceles triangle.\n- The process is repeated indefinitely.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of this infinite construction is an equilateral triangle.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Let's break them down:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial configuration consists of three distinct points $A$, $B$, $C$ on a circle.\n- At each step, exactly one vertex is moved along the circle.\n- After moving a vertex, the resulting triangle is isosceles.\n- All angles of the resulting triangle after each move are acute.\n- The vertex moved is opposite to one of the two equal sides of the current triangle.\n- The process is repeated infinitely.\n\nBut the problem statement mentions \"the same process infinite number of times\", so maybe the process is that after creating an isosceles triangle, you pick one of the two equal sides, move the opposite vertex again, etc. So each step is defined by moving the opposite vertex of a chosen equal side to form a new isosceles triangle with acute angles.\n\nThus, structuring each assumption:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial triangle $ABC$ has vertices on a circle.\n- Each iteration involves selecting a vertex opposite to an equal side of the current isosceles triangle.\n- The selected vertex is moved along the circle until the triangle is isosceles with all angles acute.\n- The process is repeated infinitely.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of this infinite construction is an equilateral triangle.\n\nI think this captures the necessary assumptions. Each assumption is a single condition. The key points are starting on a circle, moving a vertex opposite to an equal side each time, resulting in an isosceles triangle with acute angles, and repeating infinitely.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user says \"Repeate the same process infinite number of times.\" So the process is moving a vertex to form an isosceles triangle with acute angles each time. The problem is whether this converges to an equilateral triangle.\n\nSo, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial points $A$, $B$, $C$ lie on a circle.\n- Each step moves one vertex along the circle to form an isosceles triangle.\n- Each resulting triangle after a move has all angles acute.\n- The moved vertex is opposite to one of the two equal sides of the previous triangle.\n- The process is repeated indefinitely.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of this infinite step construction is an equilateral triangle.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is a single condition. The first one is about initial points on a circle. The second is moving one vertex to form an isosceles triangle. Third, angles must be acute. Fourth, the vertex moved is opposite to an equal side. Fifth, infinite repetition.",
