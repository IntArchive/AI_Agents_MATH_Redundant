    "Content": "I came across this problem when I was at a book store inside of a book made to prepare Berkeley graduates to pass a mandatory exam. I wanted to buy the book, but, alas, I didn't have the money (forty bucks is a lot of money when you don't have a job). So I took my phone out and started taking as many pictures as I could. Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures of the solutions! Enough backstory. Time for math. The problem is as follows: Prove that $\\cos^p( \\theta) \\le \\cos(p \\theta)$ if $0\\le\\theta\\le\\frac\\pi2$ and $0\\le p\\le 1$ . I tried using the series expansion for cosine, but that seemed to be a dead end. Then I tried using Euler's theorem, but I got stuck. Then I got distracted and started to think about other cosine identities. For example, $$\\cos\\left(\\frac\\theta2\\right)=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\cos(\\theta)}{2}}.$$ Then what is $\\cos(\\frac\\theta3)$ equal to? I tried to figure it out then I realized that I needed to find the root of a cubic polynomial. Then I realized that I'm better at staying focused than finding the roots of cubic polynomials. Anyways, a proof would be nice here. I really appreciate any hints or answers. I apologize for my digressions!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that cos^p(θ) ≤ cos(pθ) for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 and 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. Hmm, first, I need to understand the conditions. The angle θ is between 0 and π/2, which means we're dealing with the first quadrant where cosine is positive and decreasing. The exponent p is between 0 and 1, so we're dealing with exponents that are fractions. \n\nI remember that when dealing with inequalities involving exponents, especially fractional ones, using logarithms might be helpful because they can turn exponents into multipliers, which might be easier to handle. Let me consider taking the natural logarithm of both sides. Since cos(θ) is non-negative in the given interval, the logarithm is defined. However, since we're dealing with an inequality, I need to be careful about the direction of the inequality when applying the logarithm. Since ln is a monotonically increasing function, the inequality direction remains the same if both sides are positive, which they are here because cos(pθ) is also positive when θ is between 0 and π/2 and p is between 0 and 1 (since pθ would be between 0 and π/2 as well). \n\nSo, applying ln to both sides, we get:\n\nln(cos^p(θ)) ≤ ln(cos(pθ))\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\np * ln(cosθ) ≤ ln(cos(pθ))\n\nNow, rearranging, we can write:\n\nln(cos(pθ)) - p * ln(cosθ) ≥ 0\n\nLet me define a function f(θ) = ln(cos(pθ)) - p * ln(cosθ). If I can show that f(θ) ≥ 0 for all θ in [0, π/2] and p in [0,1], then the original inequality holds.\n\nTo analyze f(θ), maybe taking derivatives would help. Let's compute the derivative of f(θ) with respect to θ.\n\nFirst, the derivative of ln(cos(pθ)) with respect to θ is (1/cos(pθ)) * (-p sin(pθ)) = -p tan(pθ).\n\nThe derivative of -p * ln(cosθ) is -p * (1/cosθ) * (-sinθ) = p tanθ.\n\nSo, f’(θ) = -p tan(pθ) + p tanθ = p [tanθ - tan(pθ)]\n\nNow, since p is between 0 and 1, and θ is between 0 and π/2, let's analyze tanθ - tan(pθ). For θ > 0, since tan is increasing on (0, π/2), and p ≤ 1, then pθ ≤ θ, so tan(pθ) ≤ tanθ. Therefore, tanθ - tan(pθ) ≥ 0. Hence, f’(θ) = p [tanθ - tan(pθ)] ≥ 0. This means that f(θ) is non-decreasing on [0, π/2].\n\nNow, let's check the value of f(θ) at θ = 0. \n\nAt θ = 0: cos(0) = 1, so ln(cos(0)) = ln(1) = 0. Similarly, cos(p*0) = cos(0) = 1, so ln(cos(p*0)) = 0. Therefore, f(0) = 0 - p*0 = 0.\n\nSince f(0) = 0 and f is non-decreasing, then f(θ) ≥ 0 for all θ in [0, π/2]. Therefore, the inequality holds. \n\nWait, but let me check another point, say θ = π/2. However, at θ = π/2, cos(θ) = 0, so ln(cosθ) would be undefined. But the original problem states θ is in [0, π/2], so maybe θ approaches π/2 but doesn't reach it. At θ = π/2, the left-hand side cos^p(θ) is 0^p = 0, and the right-hand side cos(pθ) would be cos(pπ/2). Since p is between 0 and 1, pπ/2 is between 0 and π/2, so cos(pπ/2) is positive. Therefore, 0 ≤ cos(pπ/2), which holds. But at θ approaching π/2 from below, cosθ approaches 0, so ln(cosθ) approaches -infty, but multiplied by p, which is between 0 and 1. However, we already established that f(θ) is non-decreasing and starts at 0. Wait, but as θ approaches π/2, cos(pθ) approaches cos(pπ/2) which is positive, so ln(cos(pθ)) approaches ln(cos(pπ/2)), which is a finite number. But p*ln(cosθ) approaches -infty since ln(cosθ) approaches -infty. Therefore, f(θ) = ln(cos(pθ)) - p*ln(cosθ) would approach +infty, which is positive. So even as θ approaches π/2, the inequality holds. But since the problem includes θ up to π/2, but at θ=π/2, the left-hand side is 0 and the right-hand side is cos(pπ/2) which is non-negative, so 0 ≤ cos(pπ/2) holds. So the inequality holds at θ=π/2 as well. \n\nTherefore, combining these observations: since f(θ) is non-decreasing starting at 0, and remains non-negative throughout, the original inequality cos^p(θ) ≤ cos(pθ) holds for all θ in [0, π/2] and p in [0,1].\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach using convexity or concavity. Since the function cosθ is concave on [0, π/2]. Because the second derivative of cosθ is -cosθ, which is negative in (0, π/2), so cosθ is concave there. For concave functions, we can apply Jensen's inequality. However, p is in [0,1], so maybe considering that cos(pθ) ≥ p cosθ + (1 - p) cos(0) = p cosθ + (1 - p)*1. But I'm not sure if this helps directly. Wait, but maybe using the concavity, we can say that for a concave function f, f(pθ + (1 - p)*0) ≥ p f(θ) + (1 - p) f(0). Since f here is cosθ, then cos(pθ) ≥ p cosθ + (1 - p) cos(0) = p cosθ + (1 - p). But this gives a different inequality. However, this doesn't directly relate to cos^p(θ). Maybe this path isn't as straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the inequality that for x in [0, 1] and p in [0,1], x^p ≥ px + (1 - p). But I don't think that applies here. Wait, actually, that's the Bernoulli inequality, which states that for x ≥ -1 and 0 ≤ p ≤1, (1 + x)^p ≤ 1 + px. But here we have cosθ in [0,1], so maybe take x = cosθ -1, which is in [-1, 0]. Then Bernoulli would say (1 + x)^p ≤ 1 + px, which is (cosθ)^p ≤ 1 + p(cosθ - 1) = p cosθ + (1 - p). But I don't know if this helps. The right-hand side here is p cosθ + (1 - p), which is different from cos(pθ). But perhaps comparing these two? Let's see, if we can show that p cosθ + (1 - p) ≤ cos(pθ), then combined with Bernoulli, we'd have cos^pθ ≤ cos(pθ). But is p cosθ + (1 - p) ≤ cos(pθ) true? Let's test for θ=0: both sides are 1. For θ=π/2, left side is p*0 + (1 - p) = 1 - p, right side is cos(pπ/2). For p=0, both sides are 1. For p=1, both sides are 0. For p=1/2, left side is (1/2)(0) + 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The right side is cos(π/4) = √2/2 ≈0.707, which is greater than 1/2. So 1 - p ≤ cos(pπ/2) for p ∈ [0,1]? At p=1/2: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 vs √2/2 ≈0.707. So yes, 1 - p ≤ cos(pπ/2). For p=0.1: 0.9 vs cos(0.05π) ≈ cos(π/20) ≈0.987, which is larger. So perhaps p cosθ + (1 - p) ≤ cos(pθ) holds? If that's the case, then combining with Bernoulli's inequality gives cos^pθ ≤ p cosθ + (1 - p) ≤ cos(pθ), hence the result. But I need to verify if p cosθ + (1 - p) ≤ cos(pθ). Let me define another function g(θ) = cos(pθ) - p cosθ - (1 - p). We need to show g(θ) ≥0 for θ ∈ [0, π/2], p ∈ [0,1].\n\nAt θ=0: g(0) = cos(0) - p*1 - (1 - p) = 1 - p -1 + p =0.\n\nAt θ=π/2: g(π/2) = cos(pπ/2) - p*0 - (1 - p) = cos(pπ/2) - (1 - p). As we saw earlier, for p=1/2, this is √2/2 - 1/2 ≈0.707 -0.5=0.207>0. For p=0.1, cos(0.05π)≈0.987 - 0.9=0.087>0. For p approaching 0, cos(pπ/2)≈1 - (pπ/2)^2/2, so 1 - (p^2 π^2)/8 - (1 - p) ≈ p - (p^2 π^2)/8. For small p, this is positive. For p approaching 1, cos(pπ/2) approaches 0, and 1 - p approaches 0. So let's check derivative. Let's take derivative of g(θ) with respect to θ: g’(θ) = -p sin(pθ) + p sinθ. So g’(θ) = p [sinθ - sin(pθ)]. Since θ ∈ [0, π/2] and p ∈ [0,1], sinθ is increasing, so since pθ ≤θ, sin(pθ) ≤ sinθ. Therefore, sinθ - sin(pθ) ≥0, so g’(θ) ≥0. Thus, g(θ) is non-decreasing. Since g(0)=0 and g is non-decreasing, then g(θ) ≥0 for all θ ∈ [0, π/2]. Therefore, p cosθ + (1 - p) ≤ cos(pθ). Therefore, combining with the earlier result from Bernoulli, we have cos^pθ ≤ p cosθ + (1 - p) ≤ cos(pθ), hence the original inequality holds. \n\nTherefore, there are two approaches: one using the function f(θ) = ln(cos(pθ)) - p ln(cosθ) and showing it's non-decreasing starting at 0, and another using Bernoulli's inequality combined with another inequality derived from concavity. Both lead to the desired result.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Take natural logarithm of both sides since everything is positive.\n2. Define a function f(θ) as the difference of the logs.\n3. Show that f(θ) is non-decreasing by checking its derivative.\n4. Check that f(0) =0, hence f(θ) ≥0 for all θ in [0, π/2].\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Apply Bernoulli's inequality to cosθ, considering it as 1 + (cosθ -1).\n2. Use concavity of cosine to establish another inequality.\n3. Combine them to get the result.\n\nEither way, the original inequality holds. The first method seems more straightforward.",
