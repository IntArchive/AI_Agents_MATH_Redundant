    "Content": "(Note: I'm only interested in real-valued matrices here, so I'm using \"transpose\" and \"symmetric\" instead of the more general \"transjugate\" and \"Hermitian\" in the hope that it will simplify the proof. But the theorem apparently holds for complex-valued matrices as well.) The Rayleigh quotient $R(M,v)$ of a symmetric matrix $M$ and a vector $v$ is defined as $\\frac{v^T M v}{v^T v}$, where $x^T$ is the matrix transpose of $x$. I've been told that the vector $v$ which gives the largest Rayleigh quotient is, in fact, the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $M$. And furthermore, the value of the quotient in this case is equal to that eigenvalue. However, I've been unable to find a full proof of this fact, or an explanation of why it should work this way. Why is there this connection between the Rayleigh quotient and the eigenvalues? Anything from an intuitive explanation to a formal proof would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, note that R does not depend on the length of v, so we might as well impose the constraint $\\mid v\\mid^2=1$. We maximize $R$ subject to this constraint by using a Lagrange multiplier: $v^tMv+\\lambda (\\mid v\\mid^2-1)$, and differentiating with respect to the components of v, we obtain the equation $Mv+\\lambda v=0$, so the extrema are precisely the eigenvectors of $M$. If $v$ is an eigenvector, then it follows immediately that the value of $R$ is the corresponding eigenvalue.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to know why the maximum Rayleigh quotient of a symmetric matrix M is equal to its largest eigenvalue, and why the maximizing vector v is the corresponding eigenvector. I need to structure this according to the given format, listing assumptions line by line and then the problem.\n\nFirst, let's parse the original question. The user mentions real-valued matrices, so the assumptions should include that M is a real symmetric matrix. They define the Rayleigh quotient as R(M, v) = (v^T M v)/(v^T v). They want to prove that the maximum value of this quotient over all non-zero vectors v is the largest eigenvalue of M, and that this maximum is achieved when v is the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. M is a real symmetric matrix. (Because the user specifies they're interested in real matrices, and they mention using transpose and symmetric.)\n2. The Rayleigh quotient is defined as (v^T M v)/(v^T v). (That's the definition given.)\n3. v is a non-zero vector. (Since the denominator is v^T v, which is zero only if v is the zero vector, which is excluded.)\n4. The problem is about finding the maximum value of this quotient. (The user is interested in why the maximum is the largest eigenvalue.)\n\nWait, the original problem also mentions that the theorem holds for complex matrices, but the user is focusing on real ones. So in the assumptions, we should stick to the real case as per the user's note. So the first assumption is M is a real symmetric matrix. The Rayleigh quotient uses transpose, so that's for real vectors. \n\nAnother assumption is that the vector v is non-zero, because otherwise the quotient is undefined. So that's another line.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that the maximum Rayleigh quotient is the largest eigenvalue and that the maximizing vector is the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nWait, the example given in the initial instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So here, each line should be a separate assumption. So let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a real symmetric matrix,\nv is a non-zero real vector,\nRayleigh quotient is defined as (v^T M v)/(v^T v),\nThe problem considers the maximum of the Rayleigh quotient over all non-zero vectors v.\n\nWait, but the last one might be part of the problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the problem part was the actual statement to prove. Here, the problem is to prove that the maximum Rayleigh quotient equals the largest eigenvalue and that the maximizing v is the eigenvector. So the assumptions should include the conditions on M and v. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumptions:\n- M is a real symmetric matrix.\n- v is a non-zero real vector.\n- The Rayleigh quotient R(M, v) is defined as (v^T M v)/(v^T v).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the maximum value of R(M, v) over all non-zero vectors v is equal to the largest eigenvalue of M, and that this maximum is attained when v is the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. But the formatted problem in the example adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which might not be part of the original problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems wrong. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which actually changes the problem. That might be an error in the example. But perhaps the user intended that in their example, the problem was to prove under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer. So maybe the example is incorrect, but I should follow their structure regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question states they are interested in real matrices, so the assumptions are M is real symmetric, v is a non-zero real vector. The problem is to prove the maximum Rayleigh quotient is the largest eigenvalue, achieved at the eigenvector.\n\nSo, structuring accordingly:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a real symmetric matrix,\nv is a non-zero real vector,\nThe Rayleigh quotient is defined as R(M, v) = (v^T M v)/(v^T v).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the maximum value of R(M, v) over all non-zero vectors v is equal to the largest eigenvalue of M, and that this maximum is attained when v is the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nWait, but perhaps \"over all non-zero vectors v\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. But in the example, \"n is an integer\" was an assumption, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So in the current problem, the assumptions are the conditions given, and the problem is the statement to prove. The user is asking to structure the problem by extracting the assumptions from the original question and then stating the problem.\n\nSo the original question mentions that M is symmetric, real, and the Rayleigh quotient is defined as such. The problem is to prove that the maximum quotient is the largest eigenvalue, achieved by its eigenvector. So the assumptions are the properties given (M is real symmetric, v non-zero, quotient defined as such), and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nI think that's correct. So the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nM is a real symmetric matrix,\nv is a non-zero real vector,\nThe Rayleigh quotient is defined as $R(M, v) = \\frac{v^T M v}{v^T v}$.\nProblem:\nProve that the maximum value of $R(M, v)$ over all non-zero vectors $v$ is equal to the largest eigenvalue of $M$, and that this maximum is attained when $v$ is the corresponding eigenvector.\n###",
