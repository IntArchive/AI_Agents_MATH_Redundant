    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to prove that a certain product involving complex numbers is real. The given conditions are that all the complex numbers z₁, z₂, ..., zₙ have absolute value 1, meaning they lie on the unit circle in the complex plane. The expression to consider is the product: (1 + z₂/z₁)(1 + z₃/z₂)...(1 + z₁/zₙ). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term in the product looks like. Each term is of the form 1 + z_{k+1}/z_k, where z_{k+1} and z_k are on the unit circle. Since |z_k| = 1, z_{k}/z_{k-1} would also have absolute value 1, right? Because dividing two complex numbers on the unit circle gives another on the unit circle. So each term 1 + (something on the unit circle). \n\nThe user mentioned trying induction and writing each subexpression as 1 + e^{i(theta differences)}. Let me think about that. If z_k = e^{iθ_k}, then z_{k+1}/z_k = e^{i(θ_{k+1} - θ_k)}. So each term becomes 1 + e^{iΔθ}, where Δθ is the difference in angles. Then the product of all these terms would be the product of such terms. But how does that help in showing the entire product is real?\n\nAnother approach could be to note that for a complex number to be real, it must equal its own conjugate. So maybe if we take the conjugate of the entire product, it should equal the original product. Let's try that. The conjugate of a product is the product of the conjugates. So the conjugate of the entire expression would be the product over each term's conjugate. Let's look at one term: 1 + z_{k+1}/z_k. Its conjugate is 1 + conjugate(z_{k+1}/z_k) = 1 + z_k/z_{k+1} because conjugate(z_{k+1}/z_k) = conjugate(z_{k+1})/conjugate(z_k) = (1/z_{k+1})/(1/z_k)) = z_k/z_{k+1}, since |z_k|=1 implies conjugate(z_k) = 1/z_k. \n\nSo the conjugate of the product would be the product of terms like 1 + z_k/z_{k+1}. But the original product is the product of terms 1 + z_{k+1}/z_k. If we can relate these two products, maybe they are equal, which would imply the original product is real. \n\nWait, let's index the terms. Suppose the original product is P = product from k=1 to n of [1 + z_{k+1}/z_k], where z_{n+1} is z₁. Then the conjugate of P is product from k=1 to n [1 + z_k/z_{k+1}]. Let's make a substitution in the conjugate product. Let j = k+1 mod n. Then when k=1, j=2; ... ; when k=n, j=1. So the conjugate product becomes product from j=1 to n [1 + z_{j-1}/z_j], where z₀ is zₙ. But this is the same as the original product but with indices shifted. So product from j=1 to n [1 + z_{j-1}/z_j] is the same as the original product except each term is 1 + z_{j-1}/z_j. But since the product is cyclic, shifting the indices doesn't change the value. So the conjugate of P is equal to P itself? Wait, not exactly. Let's see. If we reverse the order of multiplication, perhaps. Let me check with n=2. Suppose n=2. Then original product is (1 + z₂/z₁)(1 + z₁/z₂). The conjugate would be (1 + z₁/z₂)(1 + z₂/z₁), which is the same as the original product. So in that case, P is equal to its conjugate, so P is real. For n=3, original product is (1 + z₂/z₁)(1 + z₃/z₂)(1 + z₁/z₃). Conjugate would be (1 + z₁/z₂)(1 + z₂/z₃)(1 + z₃/z₁). Rearranging terms, it's (1 + z₁/z₂)(1 + z₂/z₃)(1 + z₃/z₁). Which is the same as the original product but cyclically permuted. Since multiplication is commutative? Wait, no, multiplication of complex numbers is commutative, but the order here is cyclic. Wait, the product is a product of terms in a certain order. If the terms are cyclically permuted, does the product remain the same? For example, (a)(b)(c) vs (b)(c)(a). Yes, because multiplication is commutative. Wait, no, multiplication is commutative, so the order doesn't matter. Therefore, the product is the same regardless of cyclic permutations. Therefore, the conjugate of P is equal to P, so P is real. \n\nBut wait, this seems too quick. Let me verify with n=3. Let z₁, z₂, z₃ be arbitrary on the unit circle. Compute P = (1 + z₂/z₁)(1 + z₃/z₂)(1 + z₁/z₃). Compute conjugate(P) = (1 + z₁/z₂)(1 + z₂/z₃)(1 + z₃/z₁). If we reverse the order, that's (1 + z₃/z₁)(1 + z₂/z₃)(1 + z₁/z₂), which is the same as the original product but in reverse order. Since multiplication is commutative, order doesn't matter, so it's equal to P. Therefore, conjugate(P) = P, hence P is real. \n\nSo in general, for any n, the conjugate of the product P is equal to the product of the terms in reverse cyclic order, which is the same as the original product due to commutativity, hence P is real. Therefore, the key idea is that taking the conjugate of the product gives the same product, hence the product must be real. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that each term 1 + z_{k+1}/z_k can be written as (z_k + z_{k+1})/z_k. Then the entire product becomes product_{k=1}^n (z_k + z_{k+1}) / product_{k=1}^n z_k. The numerator is product_{k=1}^n (z_k + z_{k+1}), and the denominator is product_{k=1}^n z_k. However, the denominator is product z_k = z₁ z₂ ... zₙ. The numerator is a product of sums, which is more complicated. But perhaps the denominator can be simplified. Let's see. Wait, if each term is (z_k + z_{k+1})/z_k, then multiplying all terms together gives product (z_k + z_{k+1}) / product z_k. But product z_k is z₁ z₂ ... zₙ. The numerator is (z₁ + z₂)(z₂ + z₃)...(zₙ + z₁). So the entire expression is [ (z₁ + z₂)(z₂ + z₃)...(zₙ + z₁) ] / (z₁ z₂ ... zₙ ). Let me see. Let's write this as product_{k=1}^n (z_k + z_{k+1}) / product_{k=1}^n z_k. This can be rewritten as product_{k=1}^n [ (z_k + z_{k+1}) / z_k ] = product_{k=1}^n (1 + z_{k+1}/z_k ), which is exactly the original expression. \n\nBut how does this help? Maybe if we consider the entire product and see if it's real. The numerator is a product of sums, and the denominator is a product of z_k's. If we take the conjugate of the entire expression, the numerator becomes product (conj(z_k) + conj(z_{k+1}) ) and the denominator becomes product conj(z_k). Since |z_k|=1, conj(z_k) = 1/z_k. Therefore, conj(numerator) = product (1/z_k + 1/z_{k+1}) = product [ (z_{k+1} + z_k ) / (z_k z_{k+1}) ) ] = product (z_k + z_{k+1}) / product (z_k z_{k+1}) ). The denominator conj(denominator) is product (1/z_k). So the entire conjugate expression would be [ product (z_k + z_{k+1}) / product (z_k z_{k+1}) ] / [ product 1/z_k ] = [ product (z_k + z_{k+1}) / product z_k z_{k+1} ] * [ product z_k ] = product (z_k + z_{k+1}) / product z_{k+1} = product (z_k + z_{k+1}) / (z₂ z₃ ... zₙ z₁ ) = product (z_k + z_{k+1}) / (z₁ z₂ ... zₙ ) which is the same as the original expression. Therefore, the conjugate of the expression is equal to itself, so it's real. \n\nSo that seems like a valid approach. Therefore, the key steps are recognizing that the expression's conjugate equals itself, hence it's real. Therefore, the problem can be solved by taking the conjugate of the product and showing it equals the original product. \n\nAnother way is to consider the expression as a product of terms each of which is 1 + e^{i(theta_{k+1} - theta_k)}. Then the product is the product of such terms. But maybe if we consider that the sum of all the angle differences around the circle would be zero mod 2π, since theta_{n+1} = theta₁, so the total difference would be theta₁ - theta_n + theta_n - theta_{n-1} + ... + theta₂ - theta₁ = 0. But I'm not sure how that helps directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using logarithms. Take the logarithm of the product, which is the sum of the logarithms. But that might complicate things since log of complex numbers is multi-valued. \n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that each term 1 + z_{k+1}/z_k can be written as 1 + w_k where |w_k|=1. Then, for a complex number 1 + w, when is it real? If w is real, but here w is on the unit circle, so unless w=1 or w=-1. But in general, 1 + w is not real. But the product might have a symmetry that makes it real. \n\nBut perhaps the key insight is that the conjugate of the product equals the product itself, hence it's real. As shown earlier through either substitution or algebraic manipulation. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are that each z_k has absolute value 1, and the problem is to prove the product is real. \n\nSo when structuring the problem according to the format, the assumptions would be each |z₁| = 1, |z₂| = 1, ..., |zₙ| = 1. But the problem states |z₁| = |z₂| = ... = |zₙ| = 1, so we can list each z_k having modulus 1. However, the user's example lists each assumption on one line, one object. So for the given problem, the assumptions are each z_k has modulus 1. So each line would state |z_k| = 1 for k from 1 to n. But since n is arbitrary, maybe we need to write it as |z_1| = |z_2| = ... = |z_n| = 1. However, in the example given, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the key assumptions are that each z_i is on the unit circle. So in the assumption section, it would be |z₁| = 1, |z₂| = 1, ..., |zₙ| = 1, but since that's redundant, maybe just state for each k from 1 to n, |z_k| = 1. But how to phrase it concisely. The original problem says \"Let |z₁| = ... = |zₙ| = 1\", so perhaps list each z_k's modulus as 1 in separate lines. But given that the example had two separate assumptions for the same n (integer and divisible by 7), here, each |z_k| =1 is a separate assumption. But since they are all the same, maybe just list \"For each k from 1 to n, |z_k| =1\". However, the user's example lists each assumption line by line. If we follow the example strictly, perhaps each z₁, z₂,...,zₙ have modulus 1 as separate assumptions. But that would be repetitive. Alternatively, since the problem states \"Let |z₁| = ... = |zₙ| =1\", we can write it as |z₁| = |z₂| = ... = |zₙ| =1, but according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So maybe each modulus condition is one line. But that's not feasible if n is large. Maybe the problem's assumption is that all z_k have modulus 1, and that's a single assumption. But the example's first assumption was \"n is an integer\", the second was \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, maybe the assumption is \"For each k from 1 to n, |z_k| =1\". But in Vietnamese, the user might structure it differently. \n\nWait, the original instructions say: \"All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So in the example, n is an integer (one property of n), n is divisible by 7 (another property of n). Here, each z_k has modulus 1. So if we take \"one object\" as each z_k, then for each k, |z_k| =1 is a separate assumption. But the original problem states it as \"Let |z₁| = ... = |zₙ| =1\", which is a collective assumption. However, according to the example, each assumption is on one line, so perhaps we need to list each z_k's modulus separately. But that would be n assumptions, which is impractical. Therefore, maybe the problem's assumption is that all the z_k have modulus 1, which can be stated as a single assumption: \"For each k from 1 to n, |z_k| =1\". But the example's assumptions were two separate conditions on the same object (n). So in this case, since each z_k is an object, but they all share the same property. The user's example didn't have multiple objects but multiple properties. So here, perhaps the assumption is written as a single line: \"For each k from 1 to n, |z_k| =1\". Alternatively, in the example, it's \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Similarly, here, if the problem is about multiple objects (z₁ to zₙ), each with the same property, but each being a separate object. But the example didn't have multiple objects. \n\nGiven that the user's example listed two properties of the same object (n), here, the problem has multiple objects (z₁,...,zₙ) each with the same property (modulus 1). So perhaps the assumption should be written as a single line: \"For each k from 1 to n, |z_k| =1\". But the example's format uses separate lines for each assumption, even if they apply to the same object. So maybe here, we can list each z_k's modulus as a separate assumption. However, this is impractical for large n, but since n is a variable, not a specific number, it's not possible. Therefore, the correct way is to state that all z_k have modulus 1 as a single assumption. But according to the example's format, each assumption should be on one line and applied to one object. The example had two assumptions about the same object. So in this problem, the objects are z₁, z₂, ..., zₙ, each with |z_k|=1. But since n is not fixed, we can't list each z_k separately. Therefore, the correct approach is to write the assumption as \"For each k from 1 to n, |z_k| =1\" as a single line. \n\nAlternatively, if we have to list each condition per object, but since the objects are z₁ to zₙ and n is arbitrary, the problem can't list them all. Hence, the assumption is a collective one. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption would be \"For each k from 1 to n, |z_k| =1\". \n\nSo the final formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each k from 1 to n, |z_k| =1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\n\\left(1+\\frac{z_2}{z_1}\\right)\n\\left(1+\\frac{z_3}{z_2}\\right)\n\\dots\n\\left(1+\\frac{z_n}{z_{n-1}}\\right)\n\\left(1+\\frac{z_1}{z_n}\\right)\n\\in\\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one object. However, in this case, the assumption applies to multiple objects (all z_k). To adhere strictly to the example's format, perhaps each z_k's modulus is listed separately, but since n is arbitrary, we can't do that. Hence, the only way is to write the collective assumption as a single line. The example's first assumption was \"n is an integer\", second \"n is divisible by 7\", both about the same object. Here, the assumption is about multiple objects, but they all share the same property. Therefore, the correct way is to state the assumption as \"For each k from 1 to n, |z_k| =1\" as one line.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nFor each k from 1 to n, |z_k| = 1.\nProblem: \nProve that $$\n\\left(1+\\frac{z_2}{z_1}\\right)\n\\left(1+\\frac{z_3}{z_2}\\right)\n\\dots\n\\left(1+\\frac{z_n}{z_{n-1}}\\right)\n\\left(1+\\frac{z_1}{z_n}\\right)\n\\in\\mathbb{R}\n$$",
