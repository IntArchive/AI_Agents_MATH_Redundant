    "Content": "I am given two spaces $X$ and $Y$, both Hausdorff. I have defined a uniformly continuous function on a dense set $D$ of $X$ that goes to $Y$. So once you have defined a function on a dense subset, if you would like to extend\nthis function to the whole set in a continuous manner, then there is at most one\nway to do this. For the extension to be sequentially continuous,\nall decisions are \"already made\" by determining the value of the function on the\ndense subset. The value of $f(x)$ simply must be $\\lim f(x_{n})$ where $x_{n}$ are in $D$ and converge to $x$. I proved well defined and unique. I am having trouble proving this is continuous, any help is appreciated. Thanks.. And this is embarrassing, but can someone tell me how to accept an answer. Sorry...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(I also assume that we work with metric spaces.) If you only need continuity of $g$ , then continuity (not uniform) of $f$ is enough*. Let a sequence $x_n \\in X$ converge to some point $x$ . We will show that $g(x_n)$ converges to $g(x)$ . I will write '(#)' in places, where we use the definition of $g$ for better readibility. For every $x_n$ ( $n$ is fixed) there exists a sequence $(w_n^m)_{m=1}^\\infty \\in D$ that converges to $x_n$ . Since $f(w_n^m) \\ \\to g(x_n)$ (#) and $w_n^m \\to x_n$ , we may choose such $m_n$ that $d_X(w_n^{m_n}, x_n)$ and $d_Y(f(w_n^{m_n}), g(x_n))$ are smaller then $\\frac{1}{n}$ . Now (from $d_X(w_n^{m_n}, x_n) < \\frac{1}{n}$ ) you have: $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} w_n^{m_n} = x $ , so (#): $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(w_n^{m_n}) = g(x) $ , but we have also $d_Y(f(w_n^{m_n}),g(x_n)) < \\frac{1}{n}$ , so: $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(x_n) = g(x) $ , which gives us the continuity of $g$ . *However you still need uniform continuity to show that $g$ is uniquely defined, so my approach is not better, it is just different.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is talking about extending a function from a dense subset to the whole space and proving continuity. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the original problem mentions two Hausdorff spaces X and Y. The user has a uniformly continuous function defined on a dense subset D of X that maps to Y. They want to extend this function continuously to the entire space X. They mention uniqueness and sequential continuity, and they've already shown that the extension is well-defined and unique. Now they're stuck on proving the extended function is continuous.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are: X and Y are Hausdorff spaces. D is a dense subset of X. The function on D is uniformly continuous. They need to prove the extension to X is continuous.\n\nWait, the problem says \"once you have defined a function on a dense subset, if you would like to extend this function to the whole set in a continuous manner, then there is at most one way to do this.\" So the user knows uniqueness, but their main issue is proving the extended function is continuous.\n\nThe key points to list as assumptions would be:\n\n1. X is a Hausdorff space.\n2. Y is a Hausdorff space.\n3. D is a dense subset of X.\n4. The function f: D → Y is uniformly continuous.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that the extension of f to X is continuous.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Let me check the example again. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, each space being Hausdorff, D being dense, f being uniformly continuous on D—each of these would be separate lines.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list those four assumptions. Then the problem is to prove that the extension is continuous.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says the user has already proven that the extension is well-defined and unique. So the task is specifically to prove continuity of the extended function. Therefore, the problem part should state that.\n\nLet me structure it:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a Hausdorff space,\nY is a Hausdorff space,\nD is a dense subset of X,\nf: D → Y is uniformly continuous.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the extension of f to X is continuous.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"extending a function by continuity from a dense subset\". The user is using uniform continuity on D, which might be relevant. Also, the spaces being Hausdorff is important because uniqueness of limits in Hausdorff spaces ensures the extension is well-defined. But since the user already handled uniqueness, the focus here is on continuity.\n\nSo the assumptions are correct. The problem is to prove continuity of the extension. That seems right.",
