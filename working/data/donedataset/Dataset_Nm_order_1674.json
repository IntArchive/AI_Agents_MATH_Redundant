    "Content": "I recently had a lecture in a Computer Science course involving the use of induction. The main discrepancy lies in that a few students and I think our proof should suffice, but our instructor argues that there are gaps in our logic. We really just want to get a full understanding of why there may be gaps in our logic. Problem: Prove that for $K\\geq8$ , the value $K$ can be made up of the sum of two different types of coins with value $3$ and $5$ . Our Proof: We show that this is true for $K=8,9,10$ . Let $m$ denote a $3$ coin and $n$ denote a $5$ coin. $K=8=3+5=m+n$ $K=9=3+3+3=3m$ $K=10=5+5=2n$ So we have established that this holds for $K=8,9,10$ . Let $N>10$ . Assume that our hypothesis hold for $8\\leq K\\leq N$ . We wish to show this implies it holds for $K=N+1$ . So, $K=N+1=(N-2)+3$ , and by our inductive hypothesis, $N-2$ can be made up of 3-coins and 5-coins, (since $N>10$ ), and clearly $3$ is simply one 3-coin., thus $K=N+1$ can be made up of 3-coins and 5-coins. We have established our base case ( $K=8,9,10$ ) and shown that assuming $K=N$ holds for $N\\geq10$ , this implies that $K=N+1$ holds, and thus by the principle of mathematical induction, any value $K\\geq8$ can be made up of 3-coins and 5-coins. Is our argument unsound? Our professor's disagreement was that in order to prove it in this way, we actually must prove for 3 different sequences, that is, 3 separate sequences in which our $K$ value is $8,11,14,...$ , and $9,12,15,...$ , and $10,13,16,...$ respectively. He states this is because induction must rely solely on the immediately prior term, i.e. $A_N$ implies $A_{N+1}$ implies $A_{N+2}$ ... but that our proof only relates $A_{N+1}$ to $A_{N-2}$ . Is this really how induction works? We think this is maybe because of how induction and sequences are defined in our course, but based on our prior math courses, we think this should suffice.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First we have this principle: take any (mathematically well-formed) property $P(n)$ , depending on $n$ if you can prove that $$P(0)$$ $$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\, P(n) \\implies P(n+1)$$ from this you may conclude $$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\, P(n)$$ From this induction principle you can derive many other induction principles: finite induction, backwards induction etc but we only need two of the following: You may start from any other natural number other than $0$ : $$P(k)$$ $$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N_{\\ge{k}}}\\, P(n) \\implies P(n+1)$$ $$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N_{\\ge{k}}}\\, P(n)$$ and a principle of strong induction: Suppose you prove $$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N_{\\ge{k}}}\\,\\Bigl(\\forall k \\in \\mathbb{N_{\\ge{k}}}\\, [k < n \\implies P(k)]\\Bigr) \\implies P(n)$$ then you may conclude $$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N_{\\ge{k}}} P(n)$$ In words, the first principle of mathematical induction works like this: \nYou prove the base case (it is absolutely necessary to do this!) and after that you prove that the property holds for some number $n$ by knowing only that it holds for the previous number $n-1$ !\nAnd if you work with the principle of strong induction not only that you don't need to prove the base case - you can also consider that the property holds for all of the previous numbers ! How cool is that?\nAnd this is exactly what you did in your proof by strong induction: Let's suppose that $P(n)$ means than $n$ can be rewritten as sum of $2$ 's and $3$ 's. So you take any number $n \\ge 8$ . You assume that forall $8 \\le k < n$ that property holds and then you prove that it also holds for $n$ . You do this by cases: if $n = 8$ then $P(n)$ if $n = 9$ then $P(n)$ if $n = 10$ then $P(n)$ if $n > 10$ then $8 \\le n - 3 < n$ and thus by assumption $P(n-3)$ from this follows $P(n)$ since it only has one more $3$ . So you see that $P(n)$ holds in all cases thus by principle of strong induction you may conclude $\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N_{\\ge{8}}}\\, P(n)$ Now let's see how you could proceed by using first (ordinary) induction: The idea is to use ordinary induction 3 times to prove that the property holds for 3 different sequences of natural numbers, that is for $8 + 3n$ , $9+3n$ , $10+3n$ $n \\ge 8$ from this you will be able to conclude that it in facts hold for any natural number greater than $8$ , since it'll definitely be in one of those sequences. I'll show how to do that for the first one, the other two are proved verbatim. We prove $$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mbox{ we have } P(8+3n)$$ $$n = 0, \\mbox{ we certainly have } P(8)$$ Now assume we have $P(8+3k)$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ then we need to prove that $P[8 + 3(k+1)]$ . But $8+3(k+1) = (8 + 3k) + 3$ and since $8 + 3k$ could be rewritten as a sum of $3$ 's and $2$ 's then $(8+3k)+3$ can be also rewritten this way since it is the same but has one more 3.\nThus, we have $P[8 + 3(k+1)]$ and thus by the ordinary induction you may conclude $$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\, P(8+3n)$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about whether the students' induction proof is valid for showing that any K ≥8 can be made with 3 and 5 coins. The students proved base cases 8,9,10 and then assumed it holds up to N (N>10) and then showed N+1 by subtracting 3 from N+1 to get N-2, which they say is covered by the hypothesis. The professor argues they need three separate sequences because induction typically relies on the immediate prior term, not stepping back three.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The problem is to prove that for K≥8, K can be expressed as a sum of 3 and 5 coins. The assumptions here would be the conditions given in the problem. Let's list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n- K is an integer greater than or equal to 8.\n- The coins available are of two types: 3 and 5.\n- Coins used in the sum must be of these two different types (but wait, the problem says \"two different types of coins with value 3 and 5\". Wait, the original problem says \"two different types of coins with value 3 and 5\". So the coins are of denominations 3 and 5, and the sum should use some combination of these. So the problem isn't that the coins themselves are different in each term, but that you can use any number of 3 and 5 coins. So the student's proof uses m 3-coins and n 5-coins. So the assumptions would be that K is at least 8, the coins are 3 and 5, and the sum should consist of some combination of these. But the problem as stated is: \"Prove that for K≥8, the value K can be made up of the sum of two different types of coins with value 3 and 5.\" So the key assumptions are:\n\nAssumption 1: K is an integer where K ≥8.\nAssumption 2: The coins available have values 3 and 5.\nAssumption 3: The sum uses any number of 3-coin and 5-coin (i.e., non-negative integers m and n such that 3m +5n = K).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is translating, perhaps the original problem didn't specify non-negative integers, but since it's about coins, that's implied. So in the example given by the user, the original problem's assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but here, in this problem, the key assumptions are K is integer ≥8, coins are 3 and 5, and the sum is possible. But since the problem is to prove that for K≥8, such a combination exists, the problem's assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: K is an integer, K is greater than or equal to 8, coins available are of denominations 3 and 5, the sum consists of non-negative integer combinations of these coins.\n\nBut wait, the user's example for the previous problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the problem's explicit assumptions are:\n\n- K is an integer.\n- K is greater than or equal to 8.\n- The coins used are of denominations 3 and 5.\n- The sum requires using these two types of coins (but the problem says \"two different types\", so maybe that's part of the problem's condition).\n\nWait, the problem is to prove that K can be made up of the sum of two different types of coins (3 and 5). So the coins are given as 3 and 5, and K must be expressed as their combination. So the problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- K is an integer with K ≥8.\n- The coins have values 3 and 5.\n- The sum uses any number of 3- and 5-coins (non-negative integers).\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user says \"the value K can be made up of the sum of two different types of coins with value 3 and 5\". So the problem's conditions are K ≥8, and the coins are 3 and 5. So each line in the assumption part should list one condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nK is an integer,\nK is greater than or equal to 8,\nThe coins available are of denominations 3 and 5,\nThe sum of coins uses non-negative integer quantities of each type.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's example didn't list all possible assumptions, just those given in the problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the user formatted assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem statement, the user's example shows that the problem had n being an integer, but the assumption in the formatted problem includes that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's hidden condition (since 91=13*7, so the problem likely required n divisible by 7, but the original problem's statement didn't mention that, perhaps a mistake). Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the problem actually had that condition. Wait, perhaps that was an error in the example. Wait, the user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem's assumption includes n is divisible by 7. That seems like the user made a mistake in the example, but perhaps that's part of the process? Wait, maybe the user is filtering out unrelated information and adding necessary assumptions. Hmm, this is confusing. But according to the instructions, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter the unrelated information, and structure the problem in the given format. So in the current problem, the original question's problem is: Prove that for K≥8, K can be made up of 3 and 5 coins. So the assumptions are:\n\n- K is an integer.\n- K ≥8.\n- Coins available are 3 and 5.\n\nBut perhaps the problem assumes that the coins can be used any number of times (which is standard in coin problems). So the key assumptions are K is integer ≥8, and coins of 3 and 5. The problem is to prove that such a combination exists. So when structuring, the assumptions should be each on a separate line, each addressing one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nK is an integer,\nK is greater than or equal to 8,\nTwo types of coins are available with denominations 3 and 5.\n\nProblem: Prove that K can be expressed as a sum of non-negative integer combinations of 3 and 5 coins.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was structured to include the divisibility condition in the problem statement, not the assumption. For instance, in the example, the problem is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", with assumption that n is integer and divisible by 7. So the assumptions are the conditions that must hold for the problem to be valid, while the problem is the actual statement to prove.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to prove that K can be made up of 3 and 5 coins for K≥8. The coins being 3 and 5 is part of the problem's setup, so it's an assumption. K being an integer ≥8 is also an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions should list:\n\n- K is an integer.\n- K is at least 8.\n- Coins have denominations 3 and 5.\n\nThe problem is to prove that K can be expressed as a sum of these coins.\n\nBut in the original problem statement provided by the user (the Math Stack Exchange question), the problem is stated as: \"Prove that for K≥8, the value K can be made up of the sum of two different types of coins with value 3 and 5.\"\n\nSo the problem's assumptions are K is integer ≥8, and coins are 3 and 5. The problem is to show that such a combination exists.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nK is an integer,\nK is greater than or equal to 8,\nThe available coins are of denominations 3 and 5.\n\nProblem: Prove that K can be expressed as a sum of non-negative integer combinations of 3 and 5 coins.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, does it specify that the coins can be used multiple times? Typically, coin problems assume that you can use any number of each coin. But the problem here is about induction steps. So the key is that K can be written as 3m +5n where m and n are non-negative integers. Therefore, the problem is to prove that for all integers K ≥8, there exist non-negative integers m and n such that 3m +5n = K.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nK is an integer,\nK ≥8,\nThe coins are 3 and 5 denominations.\n\nProblem: Prove that K can be written as 3m +5n for some non-negative integers m and n.\n\nTherefore, structuring the answer as per the user's format:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nK is an integer,\nK is greater than or equal to 8,\nAvailable coins are denominations 3 and 5.\nProblem: \nProve that K can be expressed as a sum of non-negative integer combinations of 3-coins and 5-coins.\n###",
