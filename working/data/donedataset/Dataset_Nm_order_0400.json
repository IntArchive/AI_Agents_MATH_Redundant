    "Content": "I came across these two results recently: $$ \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\left(1-\\dfrac{a}{x}\\right)\\left(\\dfrac{b}{x}-1\\right)} \\: dx = \\pi\\left(\\dfrac{a+b}{2} - \\sqrt{ab}\\right)$$ $$ \\int_a^c \\sqrt[3]{\\left| \\left(1-\\dfrac{a}{x}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{b}{x}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{c}{x}\\right)\\right|} \\: dx = \\dfrac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\dfrac{a+b+c}{3} - \\sqrt[3]{abc}\\right)$$ for $0<a\\leq b\\leq c$ . I haven't tried to solve the first one yet, but I have an idea of how to approach it, namely using the substitution $x=a\\cos^2\\theta+b\\sin^2\\theta$ . I have no idea how to approach the second one, however. I think that the most interesting thing about the results above is that it seems like there is a proof for the AM-GM inequality hidden within. Clearly both integrands are positive and so the AM-GM falls out for the 2 and 3 variable case. All that is required is to prove the results. My question is twofold: How would the second integral be computed? Is there an approach using elementary techniques? Can this be generalised to prove the AM-GM inequality for $n$ -variables?",

The underlying method of this answer does not differ from that of Svyatoslav's , save for doing the bookkeeping needed to provide for the $n$ -variable case. The method can be adapted to show that, for a positive random variable $X$ that takes on a finite set of values, $$\n  \\int_{\\mathrm{ess}\\,\\inf X}^{\\mathrm{ess}\\,\\sup X}\n\\frac{\\sin (\\pi \\P(X >x))}{\\pi x}\\e^{\\E \\ln \\abs{X-x}} \\d x\n  =\\E\\,X - \\e^{\\E\\ln X}\n\\text{;}$$ it's tempting to think that this last equality holds for arbitrary positive random variables with finite arithmetic and geometric mean, but I have no proof of that. Write $I$ for the closed interval $[a_0,a_{n-1}]$ . Take\nthe cut of $\\sqrt[n]{z}$ to be the negative real axis. Write $\\mathbb{C}^*$ for the Riemann sphere. Consider the meromorphic\ndifferential forms $\\alpha_{U_0}$ , $\\alpha_{U_1}$ , $\\alpha_{U_2}$ ,\non $U_0 =\n\\mathbb{C}\\backslash (-\\infty,a_{n-1}]$ , $U_1 = \\mathbb{C}\\backslash\n[a_0,\\infty)$ , and $U_2=\\mathbb{C}^*\\backslash [0,a_{n-1}]$ given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\alpha_{U_0} &=\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt[n]{z-a_i}\\right)\\frac{\\d z}{z} \\\\\n  \\alpha_{U_1} &=-\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt[n]{a_i-z}\\right)\\frac{\\d z}{z} \\\\\n  \\alpha_{U_2} &=-\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt[n]{1-a_iz^{-1}}\\right)\\frac{\\d (z^{-1})}{(z^{-1})^2}\\text{.}\n\\end{aligned}$$ These three forms agree pairwise on the intersections of their respective\ndomains. That's because—for the chosen cut convention— if $a > 0$ and either $\\Im z \\neq 0$ or $\\Re z > a$ , then $$\\sqrt[n]{z-a} = \\frac{\\sqrt[n]{1-az^{-1}}}{\\sqrt[n]{z^{-1}}}\\text{;}$$ if $a > 0$ and $\\Im z \\neq 0$ , then $$\\sqrt[n]{a-z} = \\e^{-\\i\\pi \\sgn \\Im z /n}\\sqrt[n]{z-a}\\text{.}$$ Consequently, there is a unique meromorphic differential form $\\alpha$ on $\\mathbb{C}^*\\backslash I = \\bigcup_{i=0}^2U_i$ such that $\\left.\n\\alpha\\right\\rvert_{U_i} = \\alpha_{U_i}$ for $i=0,1,2$ . This $\\alpha$ has a\nsimple pole at $0$ and a double pole at $\\infty$ . So let $C$ be a cycle separating $I$ from $\\{0,\\infty\\}$ and oriented in the\nnegative sense. What is $$\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\i}\\oint_C\\alpha\\text{?}$$ If $C$ is taken to be a rectangle with sides parallel to and infinitesimally\nclose to $I$ , then $$\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\i}\\oint_C \\alpha\n    = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\i}\\left(\\int_{I+\\i 0^+}\\alpha -\n    \\int_{I-\\i0^+}\\alpha\\right)\\text{,}$$ the contribution from the remaining sides vanishing. If $C$ is taken to encircle $\\{0,\\infty\\}$ in a positive sense, then $$\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\i}\\oint_C \\alpha\n    = \\Res_0 \\alpha + \\Res_{\\infty}\\alpha\\text{.}$$ For the former choice, note that, for real $x$ , $$\\sqrt[n]{x\\pm \\i 0^+} = \\sqrt[n]{\\abs{x}}\\e^{\\pm\\i\\pi [x < 0]/n}$$ where $[(-)]$ is Iverson bracket notation. Therefore $$\\int_{I\\pm\\i0^+}\\alpha = \\int_I\\e^{\\pm\\i\\pi\nN(x)/n}\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt[n]{\\abs{x-a_i}}\\right)\\frac{\\d x}{x}$$ where $N(x)$ is the number of the $a_i$ greater than $x$ . Then $$\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\i}\\oint_C\\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_I\\sin \\tfrac{\\pi N(x)}{n}\n\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt[n]{\\abs{x-a_i}}\\right)\\frac{\\d x}{x}$$ which, because $N(x)$ is constant away from the $a_i$ , simplifies to $$\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\i}\\oint_C\\alpha =\n  \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\sin \\tfrac{\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\int_{a_k}^{a_{k+1}}\n\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt[n]{\\abs{x-a_i}}\\right)\\frac{\\d x}{x}\\text{.}$$ As for the latter choice: from the Laurent expansions of $\\alpha$ at $0$ , $\\infty$ $$\\alpha_z = \\left(-\\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i} + \\mathcal{O}(z)\\right)\\frac{\\d z}{z}$$ $$\\alpha_z = \\left(-\\frac{1}{z^{-1}} + \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i + \\mathcal{O}(z^{-1}) \\right)\\frac{\\d (z^{-1})}{z^{-1}}$$ the required residues are found to be $$\\Res_0 \\alpha = - \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i}$$ $$\\Res_{\\infty} \\alpha = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i$$ whence $$\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\i}\\oint_C\\alpha =\n\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i - \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i}\\text{.}$$ These two choices of $C$ must result in the same value for $\\tfrac{1}{2\\pi\\i}\\int_C\\alpha$ , whence $$\\boxed{\n  \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\sin \\tfrac{\\pi (k+1)}{n}\\int_{a_k}^{a_{k+1}}\n\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt[n]{\\abs{x-a_i}}\\right)\\frac{\\d x}{x}\n  =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i - \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i}\n}\\text{.}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nLooking at the original question: There are two integrals presented. The first one is from a to b of sqrt[(1 - a/x)(b/x - 1)] dx equals pi[(a+b)/2 - sqrt(ab)]. The second integral is from a to c of the cube root of the absolute product of (1 - a/x)(1 - b/x)(1 - c/x) dx equals (2pi/sqrt(3))[(a + b + c)/3 - cube root of abc]. The conditions given are 0 < a ≤ b ≤ c. The user mentions that both integrands are positive, leading to AM-GM for 2 and 3 variables. The questions are about computing the second integral with elementary techniques, generalizing to prove AM-GM for n variables.\n\nNow, to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem mentions 0 < a ≤ b ≤ c, so that's three assumptions: a is positive, a ≤ b, and b ≤ c. Then, the integral expressions themselves are given, but perhaps the assumptions are the conditions on a, b, c. The problem part would be asking about computing the second integral, approach with elementary techniques, and generalizing to prove AM-GM.\n\nWait, the original problem includes two results and then asks two questions. But the format requires a single problem. The example given had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the user's problem is twofold, but according to the instructions, we need to structure the problem part as the main question. The user's main question is: How to compute the second integral using elementary techniques? And can this approach generalize to prove AM-GM for n variables? But the example only includes the problem statement, not the questions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that...\", so the formatted problem was the same. Here, the original question is two-fold, but perhaps the main problem is to prove the two integral results and connect them to AM-GM. However, the user is specifically asking: How to compute the second integral with elementary techniques? And can this approach generalize to AM-GM for n variables?\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be stated concisely. The original problem's main points are: The two integral results, which seem to relate to AM-GM. The user's questions are twofold: compute the second integral with elementary methods, and whether this generalizes for n-variable AM-GM.\n\nBut the example filtered the original problem's assumptions. So, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no: the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that's conflicting. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, looking back: in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's not matching. Wait, is the example correct? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n must be divisible by 7, that seems like a mistake. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as a reference. So, maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but I need to follow it.\n\nWait, maybe the example is a wrong example. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So that's changing the problem. But the user might have intended that, perhaps as an example of filtering unrelated info. Hmm. Maybe the original problem had a different assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user restructured it. But the example is unclear. Anyway, proceeding with the current problem.\n\nThe problem given by the user on Math SE is:\n\nTitle: Can we prove AM-GM Inequality using these integrals?\n\nQuestion: Two integral results are presented. The user hasn't tried the first one but has an approach. The second integral is more challenging. The integrands are positive, leading to AM-GM. The questions are: 1. How to compute the second integral with elementary techniques? 2. Can this approach generalize to prove AM-GM for n variables?\n\nSo, the problem is twofold. However, according to the format, the problem should be stated as a single problem. But in the example, the problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91, which was the main question. Here, the user is asking two questions. But perhaps the main problem is to prove the two integral equalities, which then imply AM-GM. Alternatively, the problem is to use the integrals to prove AM-GM. But the user is asking how to compute the second integral and whether this method generalizes.\n\nBut following the example, perhaps we need to extract the problem as the main task, filtering out the questions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem kept that. So here, the main problem might be to prove the integral results, which then relate to AM-GM. But the user's actual question is about computing the second integral and generalizing. So perhaps the formatted problem should be: \"How to compute the second integral using elementary techniques and can this approach generalize to prove the AM-GM inequality for n variables?\" But that's combining two questions. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the two integral results and show their relation to AM-GM.\n\nBut the user's problem is twofold. However, the format requires a single problem statement. Maybe the core problem is to prove the given integrals and use them to establish the AM-GM inequality. But the user is specifically asking about computing the second integral and generalization.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to establish the connection between the integrals and AM-GM. Given the example, where the problem was to prove divisibility, perhaps here the problem is to prove that the integrals equal the given expressions involving AM and GM, thereby establishing AM-GM.\n\nBut the user's original problem says \"My question is twofold: How would the second integral be computed? Is there an approach using elementary techniques? Can this be generalised to prove the AM-GM inequality for n-variables?\"\n\nSo the problem includes two parts: computing the second integral with elementary methods, and generalizing to prove AM-GM for n variables.\n\nBut the example's problem was a single statement. So maybe the formatted problem should encapsulate both parts. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem is \"Prove that the given integrals equal the expressions involving arithmetic and geometric means, and determine if this approach can generalize to prove the AM-GM inequality for n variables.\"\n\nBut the original integrals are already given as equal to those expressions. The user wants to compute them (prove the equalities) and see if it generalizes.\n\nBut the user's exact questions are:\n\n1. How to compute the second integral using elementary techniques?\n\n2. Can this approach be generalized to prove AM-GM for n variables?\n\nSo, the problem part should reflect these questions. But according to the format, the problem is a single statement. So perhaps combining both: \"How to compute the second integral using elementary techniques and can this method be generalized to prove the AM-GM inequality for n variables?\"\n\nBut the example's problem was a statement to prove something. Here, the problem is a question. Maybe the format allows for questions. The example's problem was \"Prove that...\", which is a statement, but the current problem is a question. The user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" with the example. The example's problem was a prove statement, so perhaps we need to rephrase the user's questions into a problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is \"Prove the second integral result and determine the possibility of generalizing the approach to prove the AM-GM inequality for n variables.\"\n\nBut I need to follow the user's example. In the example, the original problem was a prove statement, and the formatted problem was the same, with added assumptions. So here, the original problem is a question asking how to compute the second integral and whether it can generalize. But the formatted problem should present the problem as a statement, like \"Prove that the integral equals ... and determine if it generalizes to prove AM-GM for n variables.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is as stated by the user: \"How to compute the second integral using elementary techniques and can this be generalized to prove AM-GM for n variables?\"\n\nBut the example used a \"Prove that...\" statement. Maybe in this case, the problem is twofold, but we need to present it concisely.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- 0 < a ≤ b ≤ c\n\n- The first integral result is given.\n\n- The second integral result is given.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are properties or conditions applied to one object. The example listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So here, the conditions on a, b, c are 0 < a ≤ b ≤ c, which can be split into:\n\n- 0 < a\n\n- a ≤ b\n\n- b ≤ c\n\nAdditionally, the integrals are given for the 2-variable and 3-variable cases. But the problem is about proving those integrals and connecting to AM-GM. However, the user's question is about computing the second integral and generalization.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions are the conditions on a, b, c, and the given integral expressions.\n\nBut the example included the divisibility condition as an assumption even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example added an assumption not present in the original problem. That might be an error, but since the user provided that example, perhaps we have to follow suit.\n\nIn this case, the original problem states that for 0 < a ≤ b ≤ c, the integrals equal those expressions. So the assumptions are:\n\n- 0 < a\n\n- a ≤ b\n\n- b ≤ c\n\nThen the problem is to prove the integrals equal the given expressions and determine if the approach can prove AM-GM for n variables.\n\nBut the user's specific questions are about computing the second integral with elementary techniques and generalizing to n variables. So perhaps the problem is: \"Compute the second integral using elementary techniques and determine if this approach can generalize to prove the AM-GM inequality for n variables.\"\n\nBut how to phrase this concisely? Maybe:\n\nProblem: Compute the integral $$ \\int_a^c \\sqrt[3]{\\left| \\left(1-\\dfrac{a}{x}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{b}{x}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{c}{x}\\right)\\right|} \\: dx $$ using elementary techniques and determine if this method generalizes to prove the AM-GM inequality for $n$ variables.\n\nBut the integral is already given as equal to the expression, so the problem is to prove that equality. So the problem is to prove the second integral result and determine if the method generalizes.\n\nAlternatively, combining both integrals and AM-GM:\n\nProblem: Prove the given integrals equal the expressions involving arithmetic and geometric means and determine if this approach can be generalized to prove the AM-GM inequality for $n$ variables.\n\nBut the user's main focus is on the second integral and its generalization. The first integral is mentioned, but the user has an idea for it. The problem is mainly about the second integral and the generalization.\n\nSo, considering all that, the assumptions are the conditions on a, b, c, and the problem is about proving the second integral equality and generalizing the approach.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \n0 < a,\na ≤ b,\nb ≤ c,\nThe integral from a to c of the cube root of the absolute product equals (2π/√3)[(a + b + c)/3 - ∛(abc)].\nProblem: \nCompute the integral $$ \\int_a^c \\sqrt[3]{\\left| \\left(1-\\dfrac{a}{x}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{b}{x}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{c}{x}\\right)\\right|} \\: dx $$ using elementary techniques and determine if this method generalizes to prove the AM-GM inequality for $n$ variables.\n\nWait, but the assumption shouldn't include the result. The example's assumption was the conditions (n is integer, divisible by 7). The problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Similarly, here the assumptions should be the conditions given (0 < a ≤ b ≤ c) split into three lines. Then the problem is to prove the second integral result and generalize.\n\nBut the user's original question already states the two integral results as given. The problem is to verify them (compute them) and see if this approach can prove AM-GM for n variables. So the assumptions are the conditions on a, b, c. The problem is to compute the second integral and check generalization.\n\nBut the integral expression is part of the problem, not an assumption. So the assumptions are:\n\n- 0 < a\n\n- a ≤ b\n\n- b ≤ c\n\nProblem: Compute the integral [second integral] using elementary techniques and determine if this approach can be generalized to prove the AM-GM inequality for n variables.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the integral equals the given expression, which involves AM and GM, thereby proving AM-GM. But the integral result is given, so the problem is to prove that equality and see if it generalizes.\n\nBut the user is asking how to compute the second integral (i.e., prove the equality) and whether it generalizes. So the problem is two parts: prove the second integral equality, and determine generalization.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n0 < a,\na ≤ b,\nb ≤ c.\nProblem:\nProve that $$ \\int_a^c \\sqrt[3]{\\left| \\left(1-\\dfrac{a}{x}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{b}{x}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{c}{x}\\right)\\right|} \\: dx = \\dfrac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\dfrac{a+b+c}{3} - \\sqrt[3]{abc}\\right) $$ using elementary techniques and determine if this method generalizes to prove the AM-GM inequality for $n$ variables.\n\nBut the problem part is a bit long, but following the example, which included the expression, this seems acceptable.\n\nSo, final answer:",
