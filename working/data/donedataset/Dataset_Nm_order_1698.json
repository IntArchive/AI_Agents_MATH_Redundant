    "Content": "In a related question we discussed raising numbers to powers. I am interested if anybody knows any results for raising numbers to irrational powers. For instance, we can easily show that there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power such that the result is a rational number. Observe ${\\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2}}$. Since we do not know if ${\\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2}}$ is rational or not, there are two cases. ${\\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2}}$ is rational, and we are finished. ${\\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2}}$ is irrational, but if we raise it by ${\\sqrt 2}$ again, we can see that\n$$\\left ( \\sqrt 2 ^ \\sqrt 2 \\right ) ^ \\sqrt 2 = \\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2 \\cdot \\sqrt 2} = \\sqrt 2 ^ 2 = 2.$$ Either way, we have shown that there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power such that the result is rational.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Real Numbers to Irrational Powers,\" and the question talks about raising numbers to irrational powers. The example given is about showing there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power that results in a rational number. The user then asks if more can be said about this topic.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out unrelated information. The original problem mentions a related discussion about raising numbers to powers, but the core here is the specific example with sqrt(2) and the follow-up question. The example provided uses sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) and considers two cases, then raises it again to sqrt(2) to get 2. The main problem seems to be asking if more results exist about irrational numbers raised to irrational powers.\n\nNow, according to the format, I need to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Then state the problem.\n\nLooking at the example the user gave, they listed assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So each assumption is a separate condition on a single object.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions are about the numbers involved being irrational. The problem is to show existence of an irrational raised to an irrational power resulting in a rational, using the given example. But the actual question is whether more can be said about such cases. Wait, the problem statement in the example was a specific one, but here the original question is more general. However, the user's formatted version of the example included the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" so in this case, perhaps the problem here is to show the existence, as per the example given, or to answer if more can be said.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. The original question in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed the assumptions and restated the problem. Here, the original question on Math Exchange is asking if more can be said about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers. The example they gave is the classic sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) case. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking for structuring the problem, so maybe the problem here is \"Can more be said about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers?\" But how to phrase that as an assumption-based problem?\n\nWait, but the example in the problem had specific assumptions. Let me re-examine the original question. The user provided an example where they structured the problem by extracting the assumptions. The original problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the Math Exchange question is a bit more open-ended. The user starts by mentioning the classic example of sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) and uses a case analysis to show existence. Then asks if more can be said. So maybe the assumptions here are that we have irrational numbers a and b, and then the problem is to show that a^b can be rational. But in the example given, the problem is about existence. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to determine under what conditions an irrational raised to an irrational is rational, but the original question is more about what results exist beyond the known example.\n\nBut the example in the user's instruction had specific assumptions. Let me think. The original problem here is more of a discussion question. However, according to the user's format, perhaps the problem needs to be structured with the assumptions and then the problem. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nThe user's original problem in the example had assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the question on Math Exchange is asking if more can be said about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers. The example given is a classic proof of existence. But the problem is phrased as a general inquiry.\n\nBut the user wants me to structure this into assumptions and problem. The key here is to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem states that they are interested in results about irrational numbers raised to irrational powers. The example given is the case where either sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is rational or it's irrational, and then raising it again gives a rational. So the existence is proven via that example. The problem is asking if more can be said beyond that.\n\nIn terms of assumptions, perhaps the problem is to \"show that there exists irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational,\" but the example already shows that. However, the original question is whether more results exist. But how to frame that as a problem with assumptions? Alternatively, maybe the problem is to \"prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational,\" but the example does that. The original question is asking if more can be said, so perhaps the problem is to \"determine what other results exist regarding irrational numbers raised to irrational powers.\"\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is a specific statement to prove. Here, the problem is more of a general inquiry. However, maybe the user wants to structure the problem as presented, which includes the example. Let me check the original question again:\n\n\"Can more be said about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers?\"\n\nSo perhaps the problem is \"Can more be said about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers?\" But to structure this into assumptions and problem, maybe the assumptions are that a and b are irrational numbers, and the problem is to determine what can be said about a^b.\n\nWait, the example in the user's instruction had specific assumptions. Let me see. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, leading to the problem. Here, the original problem's example uses sqrt(2) which is irrational, and the problem is about existence. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption: a is an irrational number,\n\nAssumption: b is an irrational number,\n\nProblem: Prove that a^b can be rational.\n\nBut the original question already shows that, and is asking if more can be said. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to \"Show that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational,\" but the user's example already does that. The original question is asking for further results. However, since the format requires a problem statement, maybe the problem is as stated: \"Can more be said about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers?\"\n\nBut the example's problem was a specific statement to prove, while here it's a general question. Maybe the user wants to structure it as:\n\nAssumption: a is an irrational number,\n\nAssumption: b is an irrational number,\n\nProblem: Determine if a^b can be rational, and what further results exist.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is \"Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational,\" which is the classic example given. However, the original question mentions that they have shown existence and are asking if more can be said. So maybe the problem is to \"Investigate further results about irrational numbers raised to irrational powers.\"\n\nBut how to structure this into the given format. The example given in the user's instruction had a specific problem statement with specific assumptions. Here, the problem is more open-ended. However, perhaps the key here is that in the original question, the user is referring to the classic example, and the problem is to show that existence. Wait, the original question says: \"In a related question... I am interested if anybody knows any results... For instance, we can easily show that there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power such that the result is a rational number... Either way, we have shown that... Can more be said...\"\n\nSo the problem is not asking to prove the existence, since that's already shown. The question is \"Can more be said about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers?\" So maybe the problem is to \"Discuss further results regarding the rationality of irrational numbers raised to irrational powers.\"\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem should be a statement to prove. Here, the problem is a request for further discussion. However, maybe the user wants to structure the problem as the initial proof, which is the existence. Let me think. The user's example formatted the problem even though the original problem had an example with two cases. The formatted problem focused on proving A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n.\n\nIn this case, the original problem's example is a proof of existence. So perhaps the problem here is to \"Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational,\" with assumptions that a and b are irrational. But in the example, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be that a and b are irrational numbers, but in the proof, we don't necessarily need to assume they are both irrational. Wait, in the classic proof, we use the sqrt(2) case, and either it's rational, in which case a and b are both sqrt(2) (which is irrational), so case 1: a = sqrt(2), b = sqrt(2), and if a^b is irrational, then we take a = (sqrt(2)^sqrt(2)) and b = sqrt(2), both irrational, then a^b = 2. So the proof uses two cases but doesn't require a priori assumptions on a and b. So perhaps the assumptions here are that a and b are irrational numbers.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is more general. However, following the user's example, the formatted problem would list the assumptions and the problem. The example had two assumptions about n and then the problem. Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption: a is an irrational number,\n\nAssumption: b is an irrational number,\n\nProblem: Prove that a^b can be rational.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is not exactly this; it's more about whether more can be said beyond this existence result. However, perhaps the user wants to extract the core problem from the question. The example in the original question is a proof of existence, so maybe that is the problem to be structured.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is asking \"Can more be said about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers?\" the problem could be \"Investigate further results about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers,\" with assumptions being that a and b are irrational.\n\nBut I think the user's example focused on a specific problem to prove, so maybe in this case, the problem is the classic existence proof. Therefore, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption: a is an irrational number,\n\nAssumption: b is an irrational number,\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist a and b such that a^b is rational.\n\nBut in the classic proof, the assumption is not on a and b being arbitrary irrationals, but constructing specific ones. So perhaps the assumptions here are not needed, but according to the format, we need to list assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions, but in the example, the user listed the assumptions given in the problem. In the original example, the problem had the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the problem to prove existence might not have specific assumptions beyond a and b being irrational. But the existence is proven via the example, so maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: a is an irrational number,\n\nAssumption: b is an irrational number,\n\nProblem: Show that a^b can be rational.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is to \"show that there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power such that the result is a rational number,\" which is the classic example. Then, the question is whether more can be said. So perhaps the core problem here is the existence proof, and the question is extending beyond that. But since the user wants to structure the problem as per the example, maybe the formatted problem is the existence proof, with assumptions that a and b are irrational.\n\nHowever, in the classic proof, the only assumption is that sqrt(2) is irrational, which is a known fact, so perhaps not stated as an assumption. Alternatively, the problem is to show that there exist irrationals a and b with a^b rational, and the assumptions are that we can use sqrt(2) and the exponentiation rules.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me check the original problem again. The original question says:\n\n\"In a related question we discussed raising numbers to powers. I am interested if anybody knows any results for raising numbers to irrational powers. For instance, we can easily show that there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power such that the result is a rational number. Observe ${\\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2}}$. Since we do not know if ${\\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2}}$ is rational or not, there are two cases. ${\\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2}}$ is rational, and we are finished. ${\\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2}}$ is irrational, but if we raise it by ${\\sqrt 2}$ again, we can see that\n$$\\left ( \\sqrt 2 ^ \\sqrt 2 \\right ) ^ \\sqrt 2 = \\sqrt 2 ^ {\\sqrt 2 \\cdot \\sqrt 2} = \\sqrt 2 ^ 2 = 2.$$ Either way, we have shown that there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power such that the result is rational. Can more be said about raising irrational numbers to irrational powers?\"\n\nSo the problem here is twofold: the example demonstrates an existence proof, and the question is asking for more results. However, when structuring this into the user's format, the example's formatted problem was taking the core problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) with assumptions. Here, the core problem in the example given by the user is the existence proof. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: a and b are irrational numbers,\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist a and b such that a^b is rational.\n\nBut wait, in the classic proof, the existence is shown without assuming a and b are irrational; instead, you construct them. The assumptions in the problem are inherent in the proof. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions, but the example in the user's instruction included assumptions from the problem (n is integer and divisible by 7). Here, perhaps the problem is to prove the existence, and the assumptions are that sqrt(2) is irrational. But sqrt(2) being irrational is a known fact, so maybe it's not listed as an assumption. Alternatively, since the problem is to show existence, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the properties of irrational numbers.\n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. Let's see the user's example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user formatted it with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, does it specify that n is divisible by 7? Let me check.\n\nThe original example says: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" so why is the assumption n is divisible by 7? That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake here.\n\nWait, the user's example might have a typo. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7 unless the problem was misstated. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is incorrect. But perhaps I should focus on the current problem instead.\n\nGiven that, maybe the user's example is not perfectly formatted, but I should follow the structure. In the current problem, the original question includes an example that uses sqrt(2) and sqrt(2) again. The assumptions here would be that sqrt(2) is irrational, which is a known fact, but perhaps the problem is to prove the existence, so the assumptions are that a and b are irrational numbers. However, in the proof, we don't assume they're irrational, but rather, we use the fact that sqrt(2) is irrational. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: sqrt(2) is an irrational number,\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\n\nBut then, the problem's proof relies on sqrt(2) being irrational, which is a known property. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are that a and b are irrational, and the problem is to show their exponentiation can be rational. However, the proof doesn't assume a and b are irrational; it constructs them.\n\nI think the key here is that the example given in the problem (sqrt(2)^sqrt(2)) requires that sqrt(2) is irrational, so maybe that's an assumption. But in reality, sqrt(2) is known to be irrational, so perhaps it's not necessary to list it as an assumption unless the problem is to prove that sqrt(2) is irrational. But the problem here is not about proving sqrt(2) is irrational, but using it to show the existence of a^b being rational.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the formatted problem should list the key assumptions used in the proof. In this case, the only assumption needed is that sqrt(2) is irrational. However, the problem as stated in the original question is about whether more can be said, but the example is the classic proof. Since the user wants to structure the problem as per the example, which in this case is the existence proof, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: sqrt(2) is an irrational number,\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\n\nBut the proof uses the fact that sqrt(2) is irrational, so that's a necessary assumption. Alternatively, if we take a more general approach, the assumptions could be that there exists at least one irrational number (like sqrt(2)), and that exponentiation rules apply. But according to the user's example, each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So sqrt(2) being irrational is one assumption. If we need another assumption for the case where (sqrt(2)^sqrt(2)) is irrational, then we might need to list that as a separate assumption, but that's part of the proof's case analysis, not an assumption given in the problem.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the key elements:\n\nThe problem presented in the question is to show that there exists irrational a and b with a^b rational. The proof uses two cases based on whether sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is rational or not. The assumptions required are:\n\n1. sqrt(2) is irrational.\n\nBecause the proof starts by taking a = sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2), which are both irrational. Then, in one case, if a^b is rational, done. If not, then take a = (sqrt(2)^sqrt(2)) (which is now irrational) and b = sqrt(2), then a^b = 2.\n\nSo the key assumption is that sqrt(2) is irrational, and if sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) is irrational, then that number is used as a. Therefore, the assumptions needed are:\n\nAssumption: sqrt(2) is irrational.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\n\nBut in the user's example, the assumptions were about the variable n (integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumption is about sqrt(2)'s property. So following the example's structure, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: sqrt(2) is an irrational number,\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\n\nHowever, the original question on Math Exchange also asks if more can be said beyond this existence result. But the user's format requires structuring the problem as per the example, which in this case is the existence proof. Therefore, I think the correct formatted problem would include the assumption that sqrt(2) is irrational and the problem to prove the existence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more general, and the assumptions are that a and b are irrational numbers, and the problem is to determine if a^b can be rational. But the example given uses specific numbers.\n\nGiven that, I think the best approach is to list the assumption that sqrt(2) is irrational, and the problem is to prove the existence. Therefore, the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: sqrt(2) is an irrational number,\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions that \"we can easily show that there exists...\" so the problem is already presented as a known result, and the actual question is whether more can be said. However, the user wants to structure the problem according to the example, which for the existence proof would involve the assumption about sqrt(2) and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number,\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational.",
