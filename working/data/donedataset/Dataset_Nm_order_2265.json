    "Content": "I'm attending a course of Measure and Integration and have some homework to do.\nWe don't have a specific book to follow, neither for exercise. I'm asked to proof that every set $A\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$ with strictly positive outer measure contains a set nonmeasurable (Lebesgue). I thought about the Cantor set.\nThinking that A is homeomorphic to Cantor set and about sharing $[0,1]$ with a numerable family of copies disjointed of A.\nBut honestly I'm not sure how to do exactly, and I would like to get a precise answer 'cause I'll have to explain in a foreigner language so the better my notes are the easier it will be. I checked other questions on this website before asking without finding anything, just some references to this property as known; probably it's my fault, so if somebody knows where to find the answer please let me know. Update:\nMay be is not clear but A is strictly positive in the outer Lebesgue measure and I think that the subset has to be strictly included.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Theorem 2.22 on page 53 of Real and Complex Analysis Rudin states: If $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is a subset with the property that every subset is measurable then $A$ is a null set. If $A$ has positive outer measure it must be uncountable. Suppose $A$ is not measurable. Removing any point $a \\in A$ yields a non-measurable proper subset $B = A \\setminus \\{a\\}$, for otherwise $A = B \\cup \\{a\\}$ would be measurable as a union of two measurable sets. If $A$ is measurable and has positive outer measure, it has positive measure, so it has a subset $B$ which isn't measurable by the theorem. Of course $B$ must be a proper subset. Thus, in both possible cases a set of positive outer measure has a non-measurable proper subset, as you wanted. I don't know why your teachers insisted on the Cantor set, I don't think that helps a lot here. In the context of non-measurable sets, Cantor sets are used to show that not every Lebesgue measurable set is Borel measurable: The collection of Borel sets has cardinality continuum while there are $2^{\\# \\mathbb{R}}$ subsets of the Cantor set. Since the ternary Cantor set is a Lebesgue null set, all of its subsets are Lebesgue measurable, but only continuum many of them are Borel measurable, so most subsets of the Cantor set are Lebesgue but not Borel measurable. If you want to see some non-Borel subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$, see also: Constructing a subset not in $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ explicitly Lebesgue measurable set that is not a Borel measurable set The proof of the theorem in Rudin is the usual Vitali argument, using inner regularity of Lebesgue measure: take a set of representatives $E$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$-cosets so that $\\mathbb{R} = \\bigcup_{q \\in \\mathbb{Q}} (E + q)$ and hence\n$$A = \\bigcup_{q \\in \\mathbb{Q}} [\\underbrace{(E + q) \\cap A}_{=: A_q}].$$\nIt suffices to show that $\\mu(A_q) = 0$ because then $A$ is a null set as a countable union of null sets. Since $A_q \\subseteq A$, it follows from the hypothesis on $A$ that $A_q$ is measurable, so $\\mu(A_q) = \\sup\\{\\mu(K) : K \\subseteq A_q \\text{ is compact}\\}$ and it suffices to show that $\\mu(K) = 0$ for every compact $K \\subseteq A_q$. Note that for rational $s \\neq r$ the sets $K+r$ and $K+s$ are disjoint, and the set $F = \\bigcup_{r \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]} K + r$ is bounded, so $F$ has finite measure. By pairwise disjointness of the sets $K + r$\n$$\n\\mu(F) = \\sum_{r \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]} \\mu(K+r) = \\sum_{r \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]} \\mu(K)\n$$\nsince Lebesgue measure is translation invariant. It follows that $K$ must be a null set, and hence $K$ is a null set. Replacing $\\mathbb{Q}$ by $\\mathbb{Q}^n$ and $[0,1]$ by $[0,1]^n$, the same argument yields that the theorem isn't special to $\\mathbb{R}$, it also holds in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that every set A⊆ℝ with strictly positive outer measure contains a nonmeasurable subset. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that A is a subset of ℝ with positive outer measure. The user also mentions that the subset has to be strictly included, but I think that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. So the main assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a subset of ℝ (A⊆ℝ).\n2. A has strictly positive outer Lebesgue measure.\n\nThe problem is to prove that such a set A contains a nonmeasurable (Lebesgue) subset. The user mentioned something about the Cantor set and homeomorphism, but those might be their initial thoughts and not part of the problem's assumptions. The key here is to list only the given conditions, not the methods or attempts.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is a single line, addressing one property of one object. So \"A is a subset of ℝ\" and \"A has strictly positive outer Lebesgue measure\" are two separate assumptions. The problem statement is then to prove that A contains a nonmeasurable subset.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"contains a set nonmeasurable (Lebesgue)\". The user's update clarifies that A has strictly positive outer measure and the subset has to be strictly included. But in the problem statement, the strictly included part might be part of the conclusion, not the assumption. So the assumptions are just about A, not the subset. Therefore, the problem is to show that within such an A, there exists a nonmeasurable set (which is a subset of A). The \"strictly included\" part is probably emphasizing that the nonmeasurable set is a proper subset, but the problem doesn't specify that it's strict, unless the user's update adds that. Looking back at the original problem: \"contains a set nonmeasurable subset\". Wait, the user wrote \"contains a set nonmeasurable (Lebesgue)\" which I think is a typo and should be \"contains a nonmeasurable subset\". So the problem is to show that such an A has a nonmeasurable subset. The user's update says \"the subset has to be strictly included\", which might mean that the nonmeasurable subset is a proper subset of A. But is that part of the problem statement or just a clarification? The original problem says \"contains a set nonmeasurable...\", so the key is that the subset is nonmeasurable. The \"strictly included\" might be redundant because if A itself is nonmeasurable, then it trivially contains a nonmeasurable subset (itself), but the problem probably wants a proper subset. However, in standard terminology, if a set has positive measure, it's uncountable and thus has nonmeasurable subsets, but the proof usually involves some kind of partitioning. The exact problem is to show that any set with positive outer measure has a nonmeasurable subset. So the assumptions are just about A being a subset of ℝ with positive outer measure. The problem is to prove that there exists a nonmeasurable subset B⊆A. The \"strictly included\" part might not be necessary unless specified in the problem, but the original question mentions \"has to be strictly included\" in the update, so maybe that's part of the problem. Wait, the user wrote: \"Update: May be is not clear but A is strictly positive in the outer Lebesgue measure and I think that the subset has to be strictly included.\" So the user is clarifying that A has strictly positive outer measure and the subset must be strictly included. So the problem is to show that there exists a nonmeasurable subset B of A where B is a proper subset. However, in standard results, if a set has positive outer measure, then it contains a nonmeasurable subset. Whether it's proper or not depends on whether A itself is measurable. If A is nonmeasurable, then A itself is a subset, but if A is measurable with positive measure, then it must contain a nonmeasurable subset (which would be a proper subset). But the problem statement says \"contains a set nonmeasurable subset\", which is a bit awkward, but likely means \"contains a nonmeasurable subset\". So perhaps the user is concerned about whether the subset must be a proper subset. The original problem doesn't specify \"strictly included\" in the problem statement, but the user added that in the update. So perhaps the problem should include that the subset is strictly included. However, in the standard problem, it's sufficient to show existence of any nonmeasurable subset, regardless of being proper. But since the user mentions \"strictly included\", maybe that's part of the problem. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a subset of ℝ (A⊆ℝ).\n2. A has strictly positive outer Lebesgue measure.\n\nProblem: Prove that A contains a nonmeasurable subset (which is strictly included in A).\n\nBut strictly included might not be necessary. For example, if A itself is nonmeasurable, then A is a subset of itself, but not strictly included. However, if A is measurable with positive measure, then any nonmeasurable subset must be a proper subset. So perhaps the problem is to show that there exists a nonmeasurable subset B⊆A, and since A has positive outer measure, such a B exists. Therefore, the problem is as stated. The user's mention of \"strictly included\" might just be emphasizing that it's a proper subset, but the key is the existence. So the formatted problem should include the two assumptions and the problem as proving the existence of a nonmeasurable subset within A.",
