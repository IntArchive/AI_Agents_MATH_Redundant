    "Content": "If $A, B$ and $A + B$ are all $n × n$ invertible matrices. Prove that $A^{−1} + B^{−1}$ is invertible and the inverse is $A(A + B) ^{−1}B$. I am afraid I am really stuck on this one, and I haven't really tried much because I don't know what to try. Thanks for all the help guys, I understand now.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a concise proof:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nA^{-1} + B^{-1} &= B^{-1} + A^{-1} \\\\\n&= B^{-1}AA^{-1} + B^{-1}BA^{-1}\\\\\n&= B^{-1}(A + B)A^{-1} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\nSo $A^{-1} + B^{-1}$ is the product of invertible matrices and thus is invertible, with inverse equal to\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n(A^{-1} + B^{-1})^{-1} &= (B^{-1}(A + B)A^{-1})^{-1} \\\\\n&= A(A + B)^{-1}B \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that the inverse of \\( A^{-1} + B^{-1} \\) is \\( A(A + B)^{-1}B \\). The question mentions that \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( A + B \\) are all invertible \\( n \\times n \\) matrices. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were about \\( n \\) being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, I need to break down the conditions given in the problem similarly.\n\nThe problem states that \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( A + B \\) are invertible. Each of these should be separate assumptions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. \\( A \\) is an \\( n \\times n \\) invertible matrix.\n2. \\( B \\) is an \\( n \\times n \\) invertible matrix.\n3. \\( A + B \\) is an \\( n \\times n \\) invertible matrix.\n\nEach assumption is about one object (A, B, A+B) and one property (invertibility). That fits the format.\n\nThe problem part is to prove that \\( A^{-1} + B^{-1} \\) is invertible and that its inverse is \\( A(A + B)^{-1}B \\). So the problem statement should capture both parts: invertibility of \\( A^{-1} + B^{-1} \\) and finding its inverse.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any extra information. The original question mentions the user was stuck and thanks for help, but those are unrelated to the mathematical problem. So the filtered problem is just the core statement.\n\nPutting it all together, the assumptions are each matrix's invertibility, and the problem is to prove the invertibility of \\( A^{-1} + B^{-1} \\) and the specific form of its inverse.",
