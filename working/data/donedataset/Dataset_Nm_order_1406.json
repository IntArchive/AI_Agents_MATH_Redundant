    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's an answer, but I am sure there should be better ones. Assume $x \\in \\mathbb R$ to be a root of the given equation. Rearrange the equation as\n$$\n(x^{35}-100) (x^{17}+2+\\cos^2 x) = - 20205.\n$$\nLet $A := x^{35}-100$ and $B := x^{17}+2+\\cos^2 x$. Since $AB < 0$, exactly one of $A$ and $B$ is positive and the other is negative. If $B < 0$ and $A > 0$, then $x^{35} > 100 > 0$, which implies that $x > 0$. Then we can conclude that $B = x^{17}+2 + \\cos^2 x > 0$, which contradicts the assumption about the sign of $B$. So this case is impossible. We are left with the case $A < 0$ and $B > 0$. From $A < 0$, we get $x^{35} < 100$. Therefore $x^{17} < 10$. Hence, $B = x^{17}+2+\\cos^2 x \\leq x^{17}+3 < 13$. Similarly, from $B > 0$, we get $x^{17} > -2 - \\cos^2 x \\geq -3$. Therefore, $A = x^{35} - 100 > (-3)^{3}-100 = -127$. In other words, $|A| < 127$. Multiplying the upper bounds on $|A|$ and $B$, we get $$|A \\cdot B| = |A| \\cdot B < 127 \\cdot 13 = 1651 ,$$\nwhich contradicts the equation $AB = - 20205$ we started out with.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format the given problem into the specified structure. The example they provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem here is to show that the equation x^{35} + 20205/(2 + x^{17} + cos²x) = 100 has no real roots.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem and list all the assumptions. The equation involves several components: x is a real number, x^35, the denominator 2 + x^17 + cos²x, and the entire expression equals 100. Let me break down each part.\n\nAssumptions would include that x is a real number (since the problem states x ∈ ℝ). Then, looking at the denominator, 2 + x^{17} + cos²x. Since cos²x is always non-negative (because square of cosine), and x^{17} is an odd power, so for real x, x^{17} can be any real number, positive or negative. However, the denominator must not be zero, so 2 + x^{17} + cos²x ≠ 0. But wait, is that an assumption or part of the problem? The problem is to show there's no real root, so maybe the denominator is never zero for real x. Let me check that.\n\nThe denominator is 2 + x^{17} + cos²x. Since cos²x ≥ 0, and x^{17} is real. The smallest possible value of x^{17} is unbounded below, but 2 + x^{17} + cos²x. If x is negative and large in magnitude, x^{17} (since 17 is odd) would be negative. So 2 + x^{17} + cos²x could approach negative infinity as x → -∞. Wait, but the denominator must not be zero for the expression to be defined. So the problem might implicitly assume that the denominator is non-zero where the equation is considered. But the original problem says \"has no root x ∈ ℝ\", which would include both cases where the left-hand side is defined and equals 100, or undefined. However, the equation is considered only where the denominator is not zero. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to show that there's no real x for which the equation holds (i.e., where the denominator is non-zero and the sum equals 100). Therefore, the assumptions would include that x is real, and that 2 + x^{17} + cos²x ≠ 0 (since otherwise the expression is undefined). Wait, but the user's example didn't include assumptions about the denominator not being zero. Maybe because the problem states \"has no root\", so the user is to assume that x is in the domain where the expression is defined. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that even if the denominator could be zero, there's no solution. But in reality, the equation would not be defined when the denominator is zero, so those points are excluded. So the problem is to show that for all real x where the denominator is non-zero, the equation does not hold. Therefore, the assumptions would be that x is real, and 2 + x^{17} + cos²x ≠ 0. But maybe the denominator is always positive? Let's check.\n\nFor x real, cos²x ≥ 0. Then 2 + x^{17} + cos²x ≥ 2 + x^{17}. Now, x^{17} can be negative, but how low can 2 + x^{17} go? If x is a large negative number, x^{17} is negative and large in magnitude, so 2 + x^{17} can be negative. For example, if x = -2, then x^{17} = -2^17 = -131072, so 2 + (-131072) + cos²(-2) = approximately -131070 + cos²(-2). Since cos²(-2) is between 0 and 1, so denominator would be approximately -131070 + something less than 1, so still negative. Thus, the denominator can indeed be negative or positive. But the problem states that there's no real root, meaning even when the denominator is positive (so the expression is defined), the equation doesn't hold. Wait, but the original equation could have solutions where the denominator is positive. So the problem is to show that for no real x (where the denominator is non-zero) does the equation hold. Therefore, the assumptions should include that x is real, and the denominator is non-zero. But the denominator being non-zero is part of the domain of definition, not an assumption imposed on x. However, the example given by the user included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe in this problem, the assumptions are just that x is real, and then the problem is to show the equation has no solution. Wait, but in the example, they included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added that assumption. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would make the problem incorrect. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, maybe they wanted to structure it differently. But regardless, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are that x is real, and the denominator is non-zero. But maybe the denominator is always positive, so we don't need to assume it's non-zero. Let's check.\n\nWait, if x is real, then cos²x is ≥0. The term x^{17} can be any real number. So 2 + x^{17} + cos²x could be positive or negative. But the expression 20205 divided by a negative number would be negative. Then x^{35} is x^{35}, which for real x, since 35 is odd, x^{35} is positive when x is positive and negative when x is negative. So the left-hand side could be a combination of x^{35} and a negative or positive fraction. However, the problem is to show that their sum is never 100. \n\nBut perhaps we need to analyze the possible values of the left-hand side. Let's consider different cases for x.\n\nCase 1: x ≥ 0.\n\nIn this case, x^{35} ≥ 0, x^{17} ≥ 0, and cos²x ≥0. So denominator is 2 + x^{17} + cos²x ≥ 2 + 0 + 0 = 2. Therefore, denominator ≥2, so the fraction 20205/(denominator) ≤ 20205/2 = 10102.5. Therefore, the left-hand side is x^{35} + something ≤ 10102.5. But 100 is much smaller, so maybe for x ≥0, x^{35} + (20205/denominator) is either large or when x is small, perhaps x=0 gives 0 + 20205/(2 +0 +1) = 20205/3 ≈ 6735, which is way larger than 100. As x increases, x^{35} grows rapidly, so the sum would be even larger. Thus, for x ≥0, LHS ≥ 6735 >100. So no solutions here.\n\nCase 2: x <0.\n\nThen x^{35} is negative (since 35 is odd). The denominator 2 + x^{17} + cos²x. x^{17} is negative (since x is negative and 17 is odd). So denominator = 2 + (negative) + cos²x. Let's see: the denominator could be positive or negative.\n\nSubcase 2a: denominator >0. Then the fraction 20205/denominator is positive. So LHS is x^{35} (negative) + positive. Could this sum be 100? Let's see. The positive term is 20205/(2 + x^{17} + cos²x). Since x is negative, x^{17} is negative. Let's let y = -x where y >0. Then x^{17} = -y^{17}. So denominator = 2 - y^{17} + cos²x. Note that cos²x = cos²(-y) = cos²y. So denominator = 2 - y^{17} + cos²y. For the denominator to be positive, 2 - y^{17} + cos²y >0 ⇒ y^{17} < 2 + cos²y. Since cos²y ≤1, so y^{17} < 3. Thus, y < 3^{1/17} ≈ e^{(ln3)/17} ≈ 1.065. So y must be less than approximately 1.065. Therefore, x is in (-1.065, 0).\n\nIn this subcase, x is between -1.065 and 0. Then x^{35} is a very small negative number (since |x| <1.065, so x^{35} ≈0 when |x|<1). The denominator is 2 - y^{17} + cos²y. Let's approximate when y is near 0: y≈0, denominator≈2 -0 +1=3, so 20205/3≈6735. So LHS ≈0 +6735 ≈6735 >100. As y increases towards 1.065, y^{17} approaches 3, denominator approaches 2 -3 + cos²y ≈ -1 + cos²y. But cos²y ≤1, so denominator approaches ≤0. Wait, but we are in subcase where denominator >0, so y^{17} <2 + cos²y. Wait, when y approaches 1.065, y^{17} approaches 3, so denominator =2 -3 + cos²y ≈-1 + cos²y. But cos²y is at most 1, so denominator approaches up to 0. So near y=1.065, denominator approaches 0 from above, so 20205/denominator becomes very large positive. Thus, LHS = x^{35} + very large positive. x^{35} is negative but y is around 1.065, so x is around -1.065, x^{35} is approximately -1.065^{35}. Let's compute 1.065^35. Taking natural logs: 35*ln(1.065) ≈35*0.063 ≈2.205, so e^2.205 ≈9.07. So x^{35}≈-9.07. So denominator≈0+, fraction≈20205/0+ ≈+infty, so LHS≈+infty -9.07 ≈+infty. So still larger than 100. Wait, but when denominator approaches zero from above, the fraction becomes +infty, so LHS tends to +infty. Therefore, in this subcase, the LHS is either around 6735 (when y≈0) or approaching +infty as y approaches ~1.065. Thus, in subcase 2a (denominator >0), LHS is always greater than 100. So no solution here.\n\nSubcase 2b: denominator <0. Then the fraction 20205/denominator is negative. So LHS is x^{35} (negative) + negative. So LHS is negative. But the equation is supposed to equal 100, which is positive. Thus, no solution here.\n\nSubcase 2c: denominator=0. Then the expression is undefined. So excluded.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, LHS is either greater than 6735 (for x≥0), or for x<0, either LHS is positive and greater than 100 (subcase 2a) or negative (subcase 2b), so no solution.\n\nHence, the equation has no real roots. The key assumptions are that x is real and the denominator is non-zero (though in reality, the denominator can be zero, but those points are excluded as the equation is undefined there). However, the problem statement says \"has no root x∈ℝ\", which likely considers only x where the expression is defined. Therefore, the assumptions would be that x is real, and the denominator 2 + x^{17} + cos²x ≠0. But in the analysis, we found that when the denominator is positive (for x≥0 or x in (-1.065,0)), the LHS is greater than 100, and when denominator is negative, LHS is negative. Hence, even considering the domain where the expression is defined, there's no solution. So the problem's assumptions are that x is real, and the expression is defined (denominator ≠0). However, according to the example given, the user might structure the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nThe denominator $2 + x^{17} + \\cos^2 x$ is not zero.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement implicitly assumes that x is in the domain where the expression is defined, so the user might not list the denominator not being zero as an assumption. Alternatively, since the problem states \"has no root x∈ℝ\", perhaps the key assumption is just x is real, and the problem is to show that no such x exists where the equation holds (including considering the domain). However, in the example provided, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user wants to list all conditions that are necessary for the problem to hold, even if they are part of the problem statement. But in this case, the problem states \"x∈ℝ\", so the assumption is x is real. The denominator being non-zero is part of the problem's conditions. So perhaps the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nThe denominator $2 + x^{17} + \\cos^2 x$ is not zero.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$x^{35} + \\dfrac{20205}{2 + x^{17} + \\cos^2 x} = 100$$ has no root $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"has no root x∈ℝ\", which would mean x is real and the equation holds. The equation is only defined where the denominator is not zero. Therefore, the problem is to show that there's no real x in the domain of the expression (denominator ≠0) such that the equation holds. Hence, the assumptions would be:\n\nx is a real number,\n2 + x^{17} + cos²x ≠0.\n\nBut perhaps the second assumption is part of the problem's domain consideration and not an external assumption. The example provided by the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem was for every integer n. That seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended to structure assumptions as the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem says \"x∈ℝ\", that's the main assumption, and the problem is to show no solution exists in that set. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$x^{35} + \\dfrac{20205}{2 + x^{17} + \\cos^2 x} = 100$$ has no root $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem includes an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but following their structure, we should list all conditions. However, in the current problem, the only condition given is x∈ℝ. The denominator being non-zero is part of the equation's definition, so maybe it's not an assumption but part of the problem. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assumption should just be x is real, and the problem is as stated.",
