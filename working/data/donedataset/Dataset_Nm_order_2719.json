    "Content": "$\\newcommand{\\range}{\\text{image}}\\newcommand{\\ann}{\\text{Ann}}\\newcommand{\\set}[1]{\\{#1\\}}$ Problem: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a field $F$ and $f$ be a symmetric bilinear form on $V$.\n  Let $W$ be a subspace of $V$.\n  If $f$ is non-degenerate on $W$, then $V=W\\oplus W^\\perp$. Below I provide a proof of this. My problem is that my proof doesn't seem to make use of the fact that $f$ is symmetric.\nIs the above theorem also true if we strike out the word symmetric? If yes, then one may not read my proof and just leave a comment. If not then can one check where have I used the symmetry of $f$ in the argument? Definitions and Notations: Given a bilinear form $f$ on a (finite dimensional) vector space $V$, we define $R_f:V\\to V^*$ as $(R_fv)(u)=f(u, v)$ for all $u, v\\in V$.\nClearly $R_f$ is a linear map. For a subspace $W$ of $V$, we write $f|W$ to denotes the restriciton of $f$ to $W\\times W$. It can be seen that $f|W$ is a bilinear form on $W$.\nWe define $W^\\perp$ as $\\set{v\\in V: f(w, v)=0 \\ for \\ all \\ w\\in W}$.\nAlso, we write $\\ann W$ to denote the annihilator of $W$. We say that $f$ is non-degenerate on a subspace $W$ of $V$ is $R_{f|W}:W\\to W^*$ has rank $\\dim W$. The Purported Proof: It is clear that $f$ is non-degenerate on $W$ if and only if $W\\cap W^\\perp=\\set{0}$.\nSo it suffices to show that $\\dim W+\\dim W^{\\perp}=\\dim V$.\nTo this end, first we note the simple fact that given $v\\in V$ we have\n\\begin{equation*}\nv\\in W^\\perp\\ \\iff\\ R_fv\\in \\ann W\n\\tag{1}\n\\end{equation*} Let $\\pi:V^*\\to V^*/\\ann W$ be the canonical projection map and conider the liner map $\\pi\\circ R_f:V\\to V^*/\\ann W$. By the Rank-Nullity Theorem we have $$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\dim V &=& \\dim \\ker (\\pi\\circ R_f) + \\dim \\range(\\pi\\circ R_f)\\\\\n\\\\\n&\\leq& \\dim \\ker (\\pi\\circ R_f) + \\dim (V^*/\\ann W)\\\\\n\\\\\n&=& \\dim \\ker (\\pi\\circ R_f) + \\dim W\n\\end{array}\n$$ Note that from (1) we know that $\\ker (\\pi\\circ R_f)=W^\\perp$.\nTherefore $\\dim V\\leq \\dim W^\\perp+\\dim W$.\nBut since $W\\cap W^\\perp=\\set{0}$, we also have $\\dim V\\geq \\dim W+\\dim W^\\perp$.\nSo we must have $\\dim V=\\dim W+\\dim W^\\perp$ and we are done.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For symmetric or skew-symmetric forms $(u,v)=0 \\implies (v,u) = 0$. But you are right, the statement does not need any of them, just decide what $\\perp$  means. The nice thing is that if non-degeneracy holds for one map, it holds for the flip one ( since, if a matrix is nonsingular, then its transpose also is). Here is a quick proof to have in your toolbox ( from Milnor&Husemoller's book Symmetric bilinear forms). Take $v \\in V$. The map $W \\to F$, $u \\mapsto (u,v) $ is a linear functional so it must be the dot product with a unique $w$ from $W$. Hence we have $v = w + (v - w)= w + w'$.  Note that $w' \\in W^{\\perp}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether the theorem that if a symmetric bilinear form is non-degenerate on a subspace W, then V is the direct sum of W and its orthogonal complement W⊥, still holds without the symmetry condition. They provided a proof that doesn't explicitly use symmetry and are wondering if symmetry is actually necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that V is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field F, f is a symmetric bilinear form on V, and W is a subspace where f is non-degenerate. The conclusion is V = W ⊕ W⊥. The user's question is whether symmetry is required.\n\nThe original assumptions in the theorem are:\n- V is a finite-dimensional vector space over F.\n- f is a symmetric bilinear form on V.\n- W is a subspace of V.\n- f is non-degenerate on W.\n\nThe problem as stated in the title is to prove that V = W ⊕ W⊥ under these conditions. The user is challenging the necessity of the symmetry of f.\n\nSo, when structuring this, the Assumption section should list each condition separately. Each assumption line should address one property of one object. The problem part is the statement to prove, but the user's actual question is whether symmetry is needed. However, the format example given was to state the problem as in the theorem, not the meta-question. Wait, looking back at the example, the original problem was about divisibility, and the formatted problem kept the problem as \"Prove that...\". \n\nIn the current case, the original problem is the theorem statement. The user's question is a follow-up about whether symmetry is necessary. But according to the user's instructions, the task is to read the Math SE question, filter unrelated info, and structure the problem as per the format. The example included an original problem and the formatted problem. So here, the main problem presented in the title is the theorem. The user's actual problem is whether symmetry is required, but the format might require capturing the theorem's assumptions and problem statement.\n\nWait, the user's question on Math SE is: If a Bilinear Form is Non-Degenerate on a Subspace W, then V=W⊕W⊥. The user is asking whether the theorem holds without symmetry. But according to the format, we need to present the problem as per the original theorem, not the user's question about it. Wait, but the user is presenting the theorem and then questioning the use of symmetry. However, the format example includes assumptions and the problem. So in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem had the assumptions and the problem.\n\nIn this case, the main problem to structure is the theorem itself: Prove that V=W⊕W⊥ under the given conditions. The user's additional question is whether symmetry is necessary, but according to the instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the original theorem. The user's own doubt is about the use of symmetry in their proof. So perhaps the problem to structure is the original theorem statement, and the user is asking whether symmetry is required. But the format given in the example just structures the problem as presented, not the follow-up questions. So the problem part here is \"Prove that V=W⊕W⊥\", with the assumptions being the ones given in the theorem (V finite-dimensional, f symmetric bilinear, W subspace, f non-degenerate on W). The user's own doubt is whether the symmetry is necessary, but that's part of their question, not the problem statement itself. So according to the example, we need to present the problem as originally stated, with the given assumptions. The user's additional questions are part of their post but are not part of the structured problem. \n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list each assumption from the theorem: V is finite-dimensional over F, f is symmetric bilinear, W is a subspace, f is non-degenerate on W. Each of these as separate lines. The problem is to prove V=W⊕W⊥. The user's proof didn't use symmetry, so they are questioning if the theorem holds without symmetry. But according to the task, we need to structure the original problem, which includes the symmetry assumption. The user's actual question is a follow-up, but the structured problem should be the main theorem as presented.\n\nWait, but looking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user's formatted problem included that assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, the example shows that the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem lists an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, in the original problem, the user was supposed to structure the problem, perhaps correcting or clarifying assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem has assumptions \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Unless the user provided an example where they restructured the problem with additional assumptions? Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That contradicts the original problem. Unless the example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, maybe the example is showing how to filter unrelated information and clarify hidden assumptions. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the divisibility by 91 requires that n is divisible by 7, but the problem states \"for every integer n\". Then, the formatted problem corrects that by adding the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that seems like a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is fabricated, and in reality, the original problem had an error, and the formatted version corrects it by adding assumptions. That would imply that the assistant is supposed to identify the necessary assumptions from the problem, possibly correcting the original statement. But that complicates things. However, according to the user's example, perhaps the task is to list all assumptions needed for the problem, even if they are implicit. But in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the actual instruction is to extract explicit assumptions from the problem, not to add new ones. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the assistant is supposed to correct it. But given that, perhaps in the current problem, we have to list the assumptions as given in the theorem, not the user's additional questions.\n\nIn the current problem, the theorem is: Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over F, f a symmetric bilinear form on V, W a subspace. If f is non-degenerate on W, then V=W⊕W⊥. The user is questioning whether symmetry is necessary.\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem as per the example, we list the assumptions given in the theorem:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field F,\nf is a symmetric bilinear form on V,\nW is a subspace of V,\nf is non-degenerate on W.\n\nProblem:\nProve that V = W ⊕ W^⊥.\n\nBut the user is asking whether the theorem holds without the symmetry of f. However, according to the format, the task is to structure the original problem, not the user's question about it. Therefore, the problem part is the original theorem's statement, and the assumptions are those given in the theorem.\n\nBut in the example, the user restructured the problem, possibly adding assumptions. But if the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", then perhaps the assistant in the example corrected an error. But that would be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is not well-structured. Given that ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as given in the problem statement, without adding or removing any, unless they are implicit. In the current case, the theorem explicitly states that V is finite-dimensional, f is symmetric, W is a subspace, and f is non-degenerate on W. These are all explicit in the problem statement. Therefore, each should be a separate assumption line.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field F,\nf is a symmetric bilinear form on V,\nW is a subspace of V,\nf is non-degenerate on W.\n\nProblem:\nProve that V = W ⊕ W^⊥.\n\nHowever, the user's actual question is whether the symmetry is necessary. But according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the original post, filtering unrelated information. The user's proof and their doubt about symmetry are part of their post but not part of the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture the original theorem's assumptions and the problem to prove.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be as above.",
