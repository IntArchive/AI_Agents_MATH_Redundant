    "Content": "For $n\\ge4$ , let G be a simple n-vertex graph with at least $2n - 3$ edges. Prove that G has two cycles of equal length. (West's Introduction to Graph Theory Q 2.1.42) I am trying to prove the above claim. So far I have reasoned as follows: G must be connected because $2n-3\\ge n-1$ for $n\\ge4$ , and any simple n-vertex graph with at least $n-1$ edges must be connected. Let T be a spanning tree of G. T must have $n-1$ edges. Therefore T has at least $2n-3 - (n-1) = n-2$ fewer edges than G. That is, $|e(G) \\setminus e(T)| \\ge n-2$ . Each one of these 'extra' edges adds exactly cycle to G, so G has at least $n-1$ cycles, each with length 3 to n. Because there are at least n-2 cycles in G, it suffices to show that $n-2$ of these edges cannot all have distinct sizes. (I'm unsure about this line... is this a correct statement?) From here I've lost my way, but I think I am on the right track. For what it's worth, this question appears right after the section that introduces trees, spanning trees, and their properties etc. Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Jernej is correct, $|V(G)| = n$ and $|E(G)|=2n-3$ does not imply that $G$ is connected. Counter example: Consider $n = 6$ , then $2n-3=9$ . You can construct a graph consisting of a single isolated node and an almost completely connected component with 5 vertices. This is possible because $|E(K_5)| = 10 > 9$ . WLOG let $G$ have $k$ connected components $c_i$ , $i=1,\\dots,k$ . Let $c_j$ be such that $|V(c_j)| \\geq 4$ and $|E(c_j)| \\geq 2\\cdot|V(c_j)| - 3$ . Such a $c_j$ must exist because $G$ could not have $2n-3$ edges otherwise. Now consider $T$ , the spanning tree of $c_j$ . It consists of $|V(c_j)| - 1$ edges, so there are at least $|V(c_j)| - 2$ edges left. Each of these edges creates a cycle of length between 3 and $|V(c_j)|$ when joined with $T$ . Since there are $|V(c_j)| - 2$ edges and $|V(c_j)| - 2$ possible distinct cycle lengths this is not yet enough to apply the pigeon hole principle. However, observe that when there is a cycle of length $|V(c_j)|$ every additional edge will create at least two new cycles. Hence either there will be a repeated cycle length when choosing $|V(c_j)|-2$ lengths with $|V(c_j)|-2$ edges, or if not, then there must be a cycle of length $|V(c_j)|$ and so there will be $2(|V(c_j)|-3)+1$ cycles. $2(|V(c_j)|-3)+1$ > $|V(c_j)|-2$ for all $|V(c_j)| > 3$ so the pigeon hole principle can be applied in this case. $\\quad\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a simple graph with at least 4 vertices and 2n-3 edges must have two cycles of the same length. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that G is a simple graph. That's one assumption. Then, it mentions that G has at least 4 vertices, so n ≥ 4. Another assumption is that the number of edges is at least 2n - 3. Also, the problem is to show that G has two cycles with the same length. \n\nWait, the user's example had each assumption as a separate line addressing one property. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. So here, for the graph problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. G is a simple graph.\n2. G has n vertices where n ≥ 4.\n3. G has at least 2n - 3 edges.\n4. The problem is to prove G contains two cycles of equal length.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the example included the divisibility condition as an assumption. Here, the problem is to prove that under the given conditions (n ≥4, 2n-3 edges), the graph has two cycles of the same length. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. \n\nSo the Assumption section should list each condition applied to one object. Let me parse the original question again:\n\nOriginal question: Show that if G is a simple graph with at least 4 vertices and 2n-3 edges, it must have two cycles of the same length.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\n- G is a simple graph (assumption about G's type).\n- G has n vertices (so n is the number of vertices, which is an integer >=4).\n- G has at least 2n - 3 edges.\n- The problem is to prove that G has two cycles of equal length.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a simple graph,\nn is the number of vertices in G,\nn is at least 4,\nG has at least 2n - 3 edges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that G has two cycles of equal length.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions included both the general conditions (n is an integer) and specific ones (n divisible by 7). Here, the problem states for n >=4, G is a simple n-vertex graph with at least 2n-3 edges. So the user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. Similarly, here, we have \"n is the number of vertices in G\", \"n is at least 4\", \"G has at least 2n - 3 edges\", and \"G is a simple graph\".\n\nYes, each of these is a separate condition applied to either G or n. So that should be the structure. The problem part is the statement to prove.",
