    "AcceptedAnswer": "Graham published a proof of this for $N = 77$ in 1963 as \" A Theorem on Partitions ,\" Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society 3 (1963), pp. 435-441. His proof is constructive and fairly short, but it does require a long table of decompositions for relatively small values of $n$.  It would be interesting to see a non-constructive proof that doesn't require such a long list. Here's his proof. First, he gives decompositions for all $n$ from 78 to 167 and all odd $n$ from 169 to 333.  Then he says, \"Now notice that each of the transformations \n$$ (a) \\:\\:\\:\\:1 = \\frac{1}{d_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{d_k} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2d_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{2d_k}$$\nand\n$$ (b) \\:\\:\\:\\:1 = \\frac{1}{d_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{d_k} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{78} + \\frac{1}{91} + \\frac{1}{2d_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{2d_k}$$\nkeeps the denominators distinct as long as no $d_i$ is 1 or 39.  The new sums of the denominators are $2U+2$ and $2U+179$ respectively, where \n$$U = d_1 + d_2 + \\cdots + d_k.$$\nSince no 1 or 39 is used in the table, then by using (a) we can first extend the table to the even integers from $2 \\cdot 88 + 2 = 168$ through $2 \\cdot 166 + 2 = 334$ where none of the new denominators is 1 or 39.  Then by using (a) and (b) we can next extend the table from $2 \\cdot 78 + 179 = 335$ to $2 \\cdot 334 + 2 = 670$.  But none of the new denominators is 1 or 39 so we can again extend the table, and so on.  This proves the theorem.\"",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original problem and extract the necessary assumptions and the core problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is asking to prove that there exists a positive integer N such that for every n > N, there exist k positive integers x₁, x₂, ..., x_k satisfying three conditions: they are strictly increasing, their sum is n, and their reciprocals sum to 1. \n\nNow, looking at the example provided, the key is to list each assumption on a separate line, each applying to one object or condition. Let's break down the problem's conditions:\n\n1. The integers x₁, x₂, ..., x_k are positive. So each x_i > 0.\n2. They are strictly increasing, meaning x₁ < x₂ < ... < x_k.\n3. Their sum is n: x₁ + x₂ + ... + x_k = n.\n4. The sum of their reciprocals is 1: 1/x₁ + 1/x₂ + ... + 1/x_k = 1.\n5. The problem states \"for every positive integer n > N\", so n must be greater than some N, which we need to prove exists.\n6. k is dependent on n, so k can vary based on n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included a condition that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's statement. In the current problem, the original doesn't specify any such divisibility, but does specify that N exists such that for all n > N, the conditions hold. So the assumptions here are the conditions that the x_i's must satisfy, as well as the existence of N.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such an N exists. The assumptions are the conditions that need to be satisfied for each n > N. However, in the example, the assumption was part of the problem's given conditions, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to show that N exists, so the assumptions would be the properties that the x_i's must have for each n > N.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nEach x_i is a positive integer.\n\nThe sequence x₁, x₂, ..., x_k is strictly increasing.\n\nTheir sum equals n.\n\nThe sum of their reciprocals equals 1.\n\nk is a positive integer depending on n.\n\nN is a positive integer such that for all n > N, such a sequence exists.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is to prove that such an N exists. So the assumptions are the conditions on x_i and the existence of N. However, in the example given, the assumptions were listed as properties given in the problem. So in this case, the problem's conditions are the three points listed (strictly increasing, sum to n, reciprocals sum to 1), and the problem is to prove that such an N exists.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list each condition that the x_i must satisfy. Let me parse the original question again:\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\nHow would one prove that there exists a positive integer N such that, for every positive integer n > N, there exist k (depending on n) positive integers x₁,x₂,…,x_k such that:\n\n1) x₁ < x₂ < … < x_k;\n\n2) x₁ + x₂ + … + x_k = n;\n\n3) 1/x₁ + 1/x₂ + … + 1/x_k = 1.\n\nSo the assumptions for each n > N are:\n\n- Each x_i is a positive integer.\n\n- The sequence x₁, x₂, ..., x_k is strictly increasing.\n\n- The sum of the x_i's is n.\n\n- The sum of reciprocals is 1.\n\nAdditionally, the problem requires that N exists such that for all n > N, such a sequence exists. So the problem is to prove the existence of N with these properties.\n\nTherefore, when structuring the assumptions, each bullet point should correspond to a single condition applied to the objects (x_i's). The problem statement is the assertion that such N exists.\n\nSo, formatted as per the example:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach x_i is a positive integer,\n\nThe sequence x₁, x₂, …, x_k is strictly increasing,\n\nThe sum x₁ + x₂ + … + x_k equals n,\n\nThe sum of reciprocals 1/x₁ + 1/x₂ + … + 1/x_k equals 1,\n\nk is a positive integer dependent on n.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that there exists a positive integer N such that for every integer n > N, such x₁, x₂, …, x_k exist.\n\nWait, but the example had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Here, the assumptions are the conditions on x_i and the existence of N. Wait, no, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, with assumption that n is integer and n divisible by 7. But the problem in the example was rephrased with those assumptions.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is to prove the existence of N such that for all n > N, the conditions on x_i hold. The problem's assumptions are the conditions that x_i must satisfy for each n > N, but N itself is part of what's to be proven. Therefore, the problem statement is to show that there's an N where, for all n > N, you can find x_i satisfying those conditions. So the assumptions in the formatted problem should list the conditions that x_i must meet for each n > N, while the problem is to prove that such N exists.\n\nSo each assumption should be a condition on the x_i's. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach x_i is a positive integer,\n\nThe sequence x₁, x₂, …, x_k is strictly increasing,\n\nThe sum x₁ + x₂ + … + x_k equals n,\n\nThe sum of reciprocals 1/x₁ + 1/x₂ + … + 1/x_k equals 1,\n\nk is a positive integer dependent on n.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that there exists a positive integer N such that for every integer n > N, there exist x₁, x₂, …, x_k satisfying the above assumptions.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they structured the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumptions being that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove existence of N, with the conditions that for n > N, the x_i's exist with those properties. So perhaps the problem statement in the format should be as given, with assumptions being the conditions on x_i and the problem being to prove existence of N.\n\nBut I need to check if the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's given conditions. In the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the original problem's assumption was that n is an integer (probably for all n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption, which may have been part of the original problem's context or a correction). Wait, the original example's problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is integer, n divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But that seems incorrect unless the original problem had a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had n divisible by 7, but in the example given, the user restructured it. Hmm.\n\nBut regardless, the key is that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem that the objects must satisfy. In the current problem, the problem is to show that for sufficiently large n (n > N), there exist numbers x_i with those four conditions. Therefore, the assumptions are the four conditions (positive integers, strictly increasing, sum to n, reciprocals sum to 1), and the problem is to show that such N exists.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included the conditions on n (integer and divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. Here, the problem's main assertion is the existence of N, so the problem statement should be exactly that, with the assumptions being the conditions on x_i's.\n\nWait, but the problem's statement is: \"Prove that there exists a positive integer N such that for every n > N, there exist x₁,…,x_k satisfying 1),2),3).\" So the assumptions are the conditions 1),2),3), which are the x_i's properties. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the properties that x_i must have, and the problem is to prove the existence of N.\n\nBut the example in the user's prompt lists the assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps in this case, the assumptions would include that n is a positive integer greater than N, and the conditions on x_i's. However, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n (with no restriction), the divisibility, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like an error unless the original problem had that condition. Wait, the original problem in the example was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem required n divisible by both 7 and 13, but the example's formatted problem only includes divisible by 7. That seems inconsistent. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the current problem as per the example.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states that for every n > N, there exist x_i satisfying 1),2),3). So the assumptions would be the conditions 1),2),3), and the problem is to prove that such N exists. However, the example includes assumptions about the variable (n being integer, etc.), so maybe here the assumptions should also include that n is a positive integer greater than N, but the problem is to find N such that for all n > N, the conditions are met.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So in this case, the problem's conditions are:\n\nFor each n > N:\n\n- x₁ < x₂ < ... < x_k\n\n- x₁ + ... + x_k = n\n\n- 1/x₁ + ... + 1/x_k = 1\n\nAdditionally, the x_i are positive integers, and k depends on n.\n\nThus, each of these should be an assumption. However, the problem is to prove the existence of N. So structuring the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach x_i is a positive integer,\n\nThe sequence x₁, x₂, ..., x_k is strictly increasing,\n\nThe sum x₁ + x₂ + ... + x_k equals n,\n\nThe sum of reciprocals 1/x₁ + 1/x₂ + ... + 1/x_k equals 1,\n\nk is a positive integer dependent on n.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that there exists a positive integer N such that for every integer n > N, there exist x₁, x₂, ..., x_k satisfying the above assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was rephrased to have the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumptions being n is integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is similar: prove that such N exists, given that for each n > N, there are x_i with those properties. Therefore, the problem statement in the format would be \"Prove that there exists a positive integer N such that for every integer n > N, there exist x₁, ..., x_k satisfying the assumptions.\"\n\nBut to match the example's brevity, perhaps the problem statement can be phrased concisely, incorporating the conditions. For instance, in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumptions listed. Similarly, here, the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that there exists a positive integer N such that for every integer n > N, there exist positive integers x₁ < x₂ < ... < x_k with x₁ + ... + x_k = n and 1/x₁ + ... + 1/x_k = 1.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each as a separate condition. So breaking down the problem's conditions into individual assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach x_i is a positive integer,\n\nThe sequence x₁, x₂, ..., x_k is strictly increasing,\n\nThe sum of the sequence equals n,\n\nThe sum of the reciprocals of the sequence equals 1,\n\nk is a positive integer depending on n.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that there exists a positive integer N such that for every integer n > N, such a sequence exists.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each bullet point addresses one property or condition applied to the objects (x_i's or the sequence). The problem is the main assertion to prove.",
