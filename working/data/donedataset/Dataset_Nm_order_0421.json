    "Content": "Math people: In the fourth edition of Strang's \"Linear Algebra and its Applications\", page 230, he poses the following problem (I have changed his wording): show that if $A \\in \\mathbf{R}^{n \\times n}$ with $\\det(A) >0$, then there exists a continuous function $f:[0,1] \\to \\mathbf{R}^{n \\times n}$ with $f(0) = I$, $f(1) = A$, and $\\det(f(t)) > 0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.  He says \"the problem is not so easy, and solutions are welcomed by the author\" (direct quote from the book).  Since the author welcomes solutions, I am not 100% sure even he has solved it.  Does anyone know if this is true or false, and may I have a solution or a hint?  I assigned this problem to a graduate student in a linear algebra class, because I wanted to give him a challenge.  Neither one of us has solved it.  I have a lot of other things to do, but I'd like to give him a hint. STEFAN (Stack Exchange FAN)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To continuosly transform $A$ to $I$, you can perform \"continuous row and column operations\" as these don't change the determinant: Ensure that $a_{n,n}\\ne0$, by continuously adding some other row to row $n$ if necessary (the existence of such a row is guaranteed by $\\det A\\ne 0$). Continouusly subtract a multiple of the $n$th row from all other rows until $a_{in}=0$ for all $i< n$. Also substract the $n$th column continuously from all other columns to ensure $a_{ni}=0$ for $i<n$ Now recurse, i.e. perform steps 1 and 2 with the top left $(n-1)\\times (n-1)$ submatrix etc. In the end you have a diagonal matrix with unchanged determinant By now you have a diagonal matrix with the original positive determinant, hence negative entries come in pairs. Such negative pairs can be continuously made postive as follows by row and column operations: $$\\begin{pmatrix}-a&0\\\\0 &-b\\end{pmatrix}\\to \\begin{pmatrix}-a&0\\\\-a &-b\\end{pmatrix}\\to \\begin{pmatrix}0&b\\\\-a &-b\\end{pmatrix}\\to\\begin{pmatrix}0&b\\\\-a &0\\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n\\to\\begin{pmatrix}b&b\\\\-a &0\\end{pmatrix}\n\\to\\begin{pmatrix}b&0\\\\-a &a\\end{pmatrix}\n\\to\\begin{pmatrix}b&0\\\\0 &a\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we have a diagonal matrix with positive entries, and these can be continuously changed to $1$, thus producing $I$. Note that only this last step changed the determinant at all. I specifically wanted to avoid rotating vectors with transcendental functions. Instead, the resulting curve above is piecewise linear and if we start with rational $A$ we can have rational matrices at every rational time $t$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about proving that the set of n-by-n real matrices with positive determinant is connected. The specific problem posed by Strang in the book is to show that for a matrix A with det(A) > 0, there exists a continuous function f from [0,1] to R^{n x n} such that f(0) is the identity matrix, f(1) = A, and the determinant of f(t) is positive for all t in [0,1]. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions several conditions. Let's break them down one by one. \n\n1. The matrix A is in R^{n x n}, which means it's a real n by n matrix. So the first assumption is that A is an element of R^{n x n}.\n\n2. The determinant of A is positive: det(A) > 0. That's another assumption applied to A.\n\n3. The function f is defined on the interval [0,1], mapping to R^{n x n}, so the domain and codomain are specified. But I think the key conditions here are the continuity of f, the starting point f(0) = I (identity matrix), the endpoint f(1) = A, and the determinant condition det(f(t)) > 0 for all t in [0,1]. \n\nWait, the problem is to show the existence of such a function f. So the assumptions would be the given conditions that must hold for the problem. Let me list each assumption on separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo the objects here are: the matrix A, the function f, the interval [0,1], and the determinant condition.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- A is a real n×n matrix (A ∈ R^{n×n}).\n- The determinant of A is positive (det(A) > 0).\n- There exists a function f: [0,1] → R^{n×n} (this is part of what we need to prove; maybe not an assumption? Wait, the problem is to show that such a function exists. So the assumptions are the given conditions, which are A is in R^{n x n} with det(A) >0. The rest are what needs to be proven: existence of f with those properties. Hmm, so maybe the assumptions are only about A. The problem is to construct f given those assumptions.\n\nWait, the example given in the format had the assumptions as the given conditions. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example, the problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that was an error? Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem states: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem has assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user provided that example as a reference for the format, not necessarily correctness.\n\nBut in the current problem, the task is to list the assumptions of the problem. The problem's assumptions here are:\n\n- A is an n×n real matrix.\n- det(A) > 0.\n\nThe rest (existence of f with those properties) is what needs to be proven.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list these two points. Each on a separate line.\n\nThe problem statement then is to prove the existence of such a continuous function f connecting I to A with the determinant condition.\n\nSo, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a real n×n matrix,\ndet(A) > 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] → R^{n×n} such that f(0) = I, f(1) = A, and det(f(t)) > 0 for all t ∈ [0,1].\n\nLet me check if I missed anything. The original question also mentions that Strang changed the wording, but the core problem is as above. The user is asking if it's true or false and for a solution or hint. But according to the instructions, I just need to structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. The example had in the assumptions \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". But perhaps that was an error. However, in the current problem, the original problem's assumptions are just that A is a real matrix with positive determinant. There's no additional constraints. So my structured problem should have those two assumptions.\n\nI think that's correct. The function f's continuity, the endpoints, and the determinant condition are part of what needs to be proven, not assumptions. So they belong in the problem statement.",
