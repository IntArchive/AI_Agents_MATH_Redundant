    "Content": "Suppose you have smooth functions $f,g : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. I am wondering whether the following conjecture is true: Conjecture : The Jacobian determinant $\\left|\\frac{\\partial(f,g)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|$ is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function $h:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f \\equiv h\\circ g$. This direction $(\\Leftarrow)$ is easy using the chain rule. I'm wondering whether the converse direction $(\\Rightarrow)$ holds as well. I'm not sure how to proceed, but I note that one immediate consequence of the Jacobian being zero everywhere is that the gradients of $f$ and $g$ are parallel everywhere: $$\\nabla f = \\alpha(u,v) \\nabla g.$$ It seems to follow that the level curves of $f$ and $g$ are parallel as well. So, intuitively, to make f and g coincide, maybe it is possible to simply scale $f$ by an amount that depends on the value of $g$ at the point (i.e. the value of the level curve passing through the point). This would mean that there exists a function $h$ such that f = h ∘ g? Update:  I would like to update the conjecture to exclude trivial reasons for the determinant vanishing, e.g. because exactly one of $f$ or $g$ is constant. Later, it may also be advantageous to exclude cases such as $f_v = g_v = 0$. Conjecture (Revised) : Let $f,g:\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be smooth functions, and furthermore suppose that the gradients of $f$ and $g$ exist everywhere. The Jacobian determinant $\\left|\\frac{\\partial(f,g)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|$ is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function $h:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f \\equiv h\\circ g$. Here is what I've tried so far. Because the partial derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are nonzero everywhere, their gradient is well-defined everywhere and hence at each point the space of vectors $\\vec{n}$ such that the partial derivative of $f$ and $g$ in the direction $\\vec{n}$ vanishes is one-dimensional. Because the Jacobian determinant vanishes everywhere, the gradients of $f$ and $g$ are parallel, and hence $f$ and $g$ are locally constant in the same direction at each point. This suggests that the level  curves of $f$ and $g$ coincide everywhere; that is, for each point $\\vec{p}\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, $$f^{-1}(f(\\{\\vec{p}\\})) = g^{-1}(g(\\{\\vec{p}\\}))$$ Hence if you give me the value of $q = g(\\vec{p})$, I should be able to find the value $r = f(\\vec{p})$ without knowing $\\vec{p}$ itself---the level sets coincide. The existence of a function $h: q \\mapsto r$ would establish the proof. More formally, let $L_f$ be the collection of level sets of $f$, i.e. $L_f \\equiv \\{ f^{-1}(f(p)) : p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\}$, and let $L_g$ be the level sets of $g$. Evidently, there are maps $C_f : L_f \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and $C_g : L_g \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ sending each level set to its corresponding value in $\\mathbb{R}$. What's special is that if we claim the level sets are equal, then there is an isomorphism $s : L_f \\leftrightarrow L_g$. In that case, our desired function is $$h \\equiv C_f \\circ s^{-1}\\circ C_g^{-1}$$ This is a correct definition because we have: \\begin{align*}\np\\in \\mathbb{R}^2 &\\quad \\text{a point in }\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\\ng(p) &\\quad \\text{its image under $g$}\\\\\nC_g^{-1}(g(p)) &\\quad \\text{the level set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ corresponding to $g(p)$}\\\\\ns^{-1}C_g^{-1}(g(p)) &\\quad \\text{that same level set viewed as a level set of $f$}\\\\\nC_f s^{-1}C_g^{-1}(g(p)) &\\quad \\text{the value corresponding to that $f$ level set}\\\\\n= f(p) & \\quad\\text{as demonstrated here}\\\\\n= (h)(g(p)) &\\quad\\text{definition of $h$}\\\\\n\\end{align*} My only remaining question is whether we can confirm that the level sets are all in fact equal with our given assumptions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We are talking here about a theorem covered in many Advanced Calculus texts. But I have not found a proof on the web. Wikipedia treats \"functional dependence\" in a purely semantic way.

Consider the auxiliary function\n$$F(x,y,t):=g(x,y)-t\\ .$$\nAs $F(0,0,0)=0$ and $F_y(0,0,0)=g_{.2}(0,0)\\ne0$ the implicit function theorem allows to solve $F(x,y,t)=0$ in a neighborhood of $(0,0,0)$ for the variable $y$: There is a $C^1$-function $\\psi$, defined in a neighborhood of $(0,0)$, such that $g(x,y)=t$ is equivalent with $y=\\psi(x,t)$. It follows that $g\\bigl(x,\\psi(x,t)\\bigr)\\equiv t$, so that\n$$g_{.1}\\bigl(x,\\psi(x,t)\\bigr)+g_{.2}\\bigl(x,\\psi(x,t)\\bigr)\\psi_x(x,t)\\equiv0\\ ,$$\nor\n$$\\psi_x(x,t)=-{g_{.1}\\bigl(x,\\psi(x,t)\\bigr)\\over g_{.2}\\bigl(x,\\psi(x,t)\\bigr)}\\ .\\tag{2}$$\nNow define\n$$\\tilde h(x,t):=f\\bigl(x,\\psi(x,t)\\bigr)\\ .\\tag{3}$$\nI claim that the dependence of $\\tilde h$ on $x$ is only apparent.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a math professor and structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe question is about whether the Jacobian determinant of two functions f and g being identically zero implies that f is a composition of some function h with g. The original conjecture is that this holds, but the user revised it to exclude trivial cases where one function is constant. They also mentioned trying to use the fact that gradients are parallel and level curves coincide.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentions that f and g are smooth functions from R² to R. The Jacobian determinant is zero everywhere. The revised conjecture excludes cases where one function is constant or gradients are zero. Wait, the user updated the conjecture to state that both f and g have gradients existing everywhere, which probably means neither gradient is identically zero. Also, the problem is about proving the equivalence: Jacobian zero everywhere if and only if f = h ∘ g for some h.\n\nSo the assumptions should include that f and g are smooth, their gradients exist everywhere (so they are non-constant?), and the Jacobian determinant is zero everywhere. But wait, the problem is to show the equivalence, so the \"if and only if\" would mean that both directions are considered. However, in the problem statement, the user is focusing on the converse direction (⇒), since the (⇐) is already handled.\n\nBut in the problem format, we need to list all assumptions. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nOriginal problem: The conjecture is that the Jacobian determinant of (f,g) is zero everywhere iff there exists h such that f = h ∘ g. The user revised the conjecture to exclude cases where one function is constant or gradients are zero. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f and g are smooth functions from R² to R.\n2. The Jacobian determinant of (f,g) is zero everywhere.\n3. The gradients of f and g exist everywhere (implying they are not zero everywhere? Or just that they have gradients? Wait, the user says \"the gradients of f and g exist everywhere and are non-zero\" perhaps? Wait, the revised conjecture says \"suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere.\" So maybe the gradients exist, but not necessarily non-zero. However, the user wants to exclude cases where one is constant, which would have zero gradient. So maybe the assumption is that neither f nor g is constant, but how is that formalized?\n\nWait, in the revised conjecture, the user says \"suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere.\" But gradients existing is part of smoothness. Since f and g are smooth, their gradients do exist. Maybe the key point is that the gradients are not identically zero? Because if a function is constant, its gradient is zero everywhere. So perhaps the assumption is that neither f nor g is constant. But how is that phrased? The user says \"exclude trivial reasons for the determinant vanishing, e.g., because exactly one of f or g is constant.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that f and g are smooth, their Jacobian determinant is zero everywhere, and neither f nor g is constant (to exclude trivial cases). Alternatively, the problem statement in the revised conjecture says \"Let f,g: R²→R be smooth functions, and furthermore suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere.\" Wait, smooth functions automatically have gradients existing everywhere, so that part is redundant. Maybe the key is to exclude cases where gradients are zero. But the user later mentions \"the partial derivatives of f and g are nonzero everywhere,\" but that might be part of their attempted solution, not the problem's assumption.\n\nWait, the original problem's revised conjecture is: \"Let f,g: R²→R be smooth functions, and furthermore suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere. The Jacobian determinant [...] is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function h: R→R such that f ≡ h∘g.\"\n\nBut smoothness already implies gradients exist everywhere, so that part is redundant. The user's update was to exclude cases where one function is constant. So maybe the assumption is that neither f nor g is constant. But how to phrase that? The problem is, the conjecture is stated as an equivalence, so the assumptions are for both directions. The user's revised conjecture includes the conditions on f and g being smooth, gradients existing (which is redundant due to smoothness), and Jacobian determinant zero. However, the \"if and only if\" requires that both directions hold under these conditions.\n\nBut to structure the problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the conjecture. The problem is to prove the equivalence. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f and g are smooth functions from R² to R.\n2. The Jacobian determinant of (f, g) is zero everywhere.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under these conditions, there exists h: R → R such that f = h ∘ g. However, the converse is already known (the (⇐) direction). The user is asking about the (⇒) direction, but in the problem statement, the user is considering the full equivalence. But the example given in the format had an assumption like n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So for this problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the conjecture.\n\nBut the revised conjecture says \"Let f,g: R²→R be smooth functions, and furthermore suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere. The Jacobian determinant [...] is zero everywhere if and only if there exists h: R→R such that f ≡ h∘g.\"\n\nWait, but \"the gradients of f and g exist everywhere\" is redundant because they are smooth. So maybe the key is to note that the conjecture excludes the cases where one function is constant. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- f and g are smooth functions from R² to R.\n- Neither f nor g is constant.\n- The Jacobian determinant of (f, g) is zero everywhere.\n\nBut the user's revised conjecture does not explicitly state \"neither is constant,\" but instead says to exclude trivial reasons for the determinant vanishing. However, in mathematical terms, the conjecture is stated as an equivalence, so the correct way is to have the problem as: Given smooth f, g: R²→R, with Jacobian determinant zero everywhere, then f = h ∘ g if and only if (the determinant is zero). Wait, but the problem is to prove that the Jacobian is zero everywhere iff f = h ∘ g.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumption included n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the problem's assumptions would be the conditions given in the conjecture. Let me check the user's revised conjecture:\n\n\"Let f,g: R²→R be smooth functions, and furthermore suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere. The Jacobian determinant [...] is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function h: R→R such that f ≡ h∘g.\"\n\nBut since smoothness implies gradients exist everywhere, so the \"furthermore suppose\" is redundant. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. f and g are smooth functions from R² to R.\n2. The Jacobian determinant of (f, g) is zero everywhere.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, the user is focused on the converse direction. The example given in the original instruction had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is the actual question.\n\nSo the problem is the conjecture: The Jacobian determinant is zero everywhere iff f = h ∘ g for some h. The user revised it to exclude trivial cases like one function being constant. So in structuring this, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f and g are smooth functions from R² to R.\n2. The Jacobian determinant of f and g is zero everywhere on R².\n3. Neither f nor g is constant. (This is inferred from the revised conjecture excluding trivial cases where one is constant. However, the original conjecture did not state this, but the user revised it to exclude those cases. But in the problem statement as revised, it's not explicitly mentioned. The problem says \"suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere,\" which is redundant, but perhaps the key is that the functions are non-constant. However, how to express that? If a function is constant, its gradient is zero. So maybe the assumption is that the gradients are not identically zero. So perhaps:\n\n- The gradient of f is not identically zero.\n- The gradient of g is not identically zero.\n\nBut the user mentions in their update: \"exclude trivial reasons for the determinant vanishing, e.g., because exactly one of f or g is constant.\" So to exclude that case, we need to assume that neither f nor g is constant. Therefore, the assumptions should include that f and g are non-constant. But how to phrase that as separate assumptions. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n1. f is a smooth function from R² to R.\n2. g is a smooth function from R² to R.\n3. The Jacobian determinant of (f, g) is zero everywhere on R².\n4. f is not constant.\n5. g is not constant.\n\nBut perhaps the user's revised conjecture does not explicitly assume 4 and 5, but rather the conjecture is stated under those conditions. However, in the problem statement, the user wants to exclude those trivial cases. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should include that f and g are not constant. Otherwise, if one is constant, the Jacobian is zero, but f = h ∘ g would require h to be constant, which is a trivial case. But the user wants to exclude such trivial cases, so the problem is under the assumption that neither f nor g is constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original conjecture does not exclude those cases, but the user revised it. The revised conjecture states: \"Let f,g: R²→R be smooth functions, and furthermore suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere. The Jacobian determinant [...] is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function h: R→R such that f ≡ h∘g.\" So the problem is as stated, but the user later says they want to exclude cases where one function is constant. However, the problem as revised does not include that in the assumptions, but the user mentions it in the update.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. To stay true to the user's problem statement, I need to look at their exact revised conjecture:\n\n\"Conjecture (Revised) : Let $f,g:\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be smooth functions, and furthermore suppose that the gradients of $f$ and $g$ exist everywhere. The Jacobian determinant $\\left|\\frac{\\partial(f,g)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|$ is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function $h:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f \\equiv h\\circ g$.\"\n\nBut since smoothness already gives gradients existing everywhere, that part is redundant. So the key assumptions are:\n\n- f and g are smooth.\n- The Jacobian determinant is zero everywhere.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, in the example given by the user, the assumption included two points: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition. Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a smooth function from R² to R.\n2. g is a smooth function from R² to R.\n3. The Jacobian determinant of f and g is identically zero on R².\n\nThen the problem is to prove that there exists a function h: R → R such that f = h ∘ g.\n\nBut the user revised the conjecture to exclude trivial cases where one function is constant. However, in the problem statement, they don't explicitly add that as an assumption. They mention it in the update but not in the formal conjecture. Therefore, to adhere strictly to the user's problem statement, the assumptions should be as per the revised conjecture: smooth functions with gradients existing everywhere (which is redundant), and Jacobian zero. However, since smoothness implies gradients exist, maybe the key is to include that the gradients are not zero everywhere (i.e., functions are not constant). But the user's revised conjecture does not explicitly state that. Hence, perhaps the assumptions are as follows:\n\n1. f is a smooth function from R² to R.\n2. g is a smooth function from R² to R.\n3. The Jacobian determinant of f and g is zero everywhere on R².\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a function h: R → R such that f ≡ h ∘ g.\n\nBut the user wants to exclude cases where one function is constant. However, if one function is constant, then the Jacobian determinant is zero, but f = h ∘ g would require h to be a constant function, which is possible. But perhaps in the problem, even with one function constant, the conjecture holds trivially. But the user considers this a trivial case and wants to exclude it. Therefore, to structure the problem as intended, the assumptions should include that neither f nor g is constant. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. f is a smooth non-constant function from R² to R.\n2. g is a smooth non-constant function from R² to R.\n3. The Jacobian determinant of f and g is identically zero on R².\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a function h: R → R such that f ≡ h ∘ g.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user revised the conjecture to exclude cases where one function is constant, but they didn't explicitly add it as an assumption. Instead, they mentioned it in the update. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to include the non-constancy in the assumptions, each as a separate line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's problem, after revision, does not require that assumption, but the answer would need to consider that if either function is constant, then h exists trivially. But the user wants to focus on the non-trivial case. However, since the problem is an equivalence, the trivial cases are covered as well. But the user's attempted solution assumes that the gradients are non-zero everywhere, which would imply that neither function is constant.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to follow the example given. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a separate line. Here, the key points from the problem are:\n\n- Functions f and g are smooth (so C^∞) from R² to R.\n- Jacobian determinant of (f,g) is zero everywhere.\n- The problem is to prove that f = h ∘ g for some h: R → R.\n\nThe user revised the conjecture to exclude trivial cases, but in the problem statement, they haven't added new assumptions beyond smoothness and Jacobian zero. The non-constancy is mentioned in the update but not in the formal conjecture. Therefore, to adhere to the problem as stated in the revised conjecture, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a smooth function from R² to R.\n2. g is a smooth function from R² to R.\n3. The Jacobian determinant of (f, g) is zero everywhere on R².\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a function h: R → R such that f ≡ h ∘ g.\n\nHowever, the user's attempted solution mentions that the gradients are non-zero everywhere, but this is part of their reasoning, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions are only the three listed above. The non-constancy is not an explicit assumption but is inferred from the gradients being non-zero. But since the problem is an equivalence, including cases where one function is constant is allowed. The user wants to know if the conjecture holds even when excluding those cases, but in the problem statement, it's part of the conjecture.\n\nGiven the user's revised conjecture, which says \"Let f,g: R²→R be smooth functions, and furthermore suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere. The Jacobian determinant [...] is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function h: R→R such that f ≡ h∘g.\" Since gradients existing everywhere is redundant (smoothness implies that), the key assumptions are f and g are smooth, Jacobian zero everywhere. The problem is the equivalence.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove the equivalence (Jacobian zero iff f = h ∘ g). However, the user's main question is about the converse direction (⇒), since the (⇐) is easy. So perhaps the problem is to prove that if the Jacobian is zero everywhere, then f = h ∘ g for some h.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f and g are smooth functions from R² to R.\n2. The Jacobian determinant of (f, g) is zero everywhere on R².\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a function h: R → R such that f ≡ h ∘ g.\n\nBut the user's revised conjecture includes the \"if and only if,\" but the main question is about the converse. However, the problem as structured should reflect the conjecture as stated. So perhaps the problem is to prove the equivalence. But the example given in the instruction had a one-direction problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) under certain assumptions.\n\nGiven the user's original question: \"Jacobian of (f,g) is identically zero if and only if f = h ∘ g?\" So the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, the user mentions that the (⇐) direction is easy, and they're asking about the (⇒) direction. But in structuring the problem, according to the example, we need to list all assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nGiven that, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a smooth function from R² to R.\n2. g is a smooth function from R² to R.\n3. The Jacobian determinant of (f, g) is zero everywhere on R².\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a function h: R → R such that f ≡ h ∘ g.\n\nBut the user's revised conjecture includes excluding cases where one function is constant. However, the problem as stated in the conjecture does not explicitly exclude them. So perhaps the answer should include those assumptions. However, if one function is constant, say f is constant, then f = h ∘ g would require h to be a constant function, which is possible. So the conjecture still holds, but trivially. The user wants to exclude such cases, but the conjecture as stated does not. Therefore, to adhere to the problem as stated in the revised conjecture, the assumptions are as above.\n\nHowever, in the user's attempted solution, they mention that the gradients are non-zero everywhere, which would imply that neither function is constant. But this is part of their reasoning, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the problem's assumptions do not include non-constancy.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have assumptions as:\n\nassumption:\n$f$ is a smooth function from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\n$g$ is a smooth function from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\nthe Jacobian determinant $\\left|\\frac{\\partial(f,g)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|$ is zero everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nproblem:\nProve that there exists a function $h:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f \\equiv h \\circ g$.\n\nBut the user's revised conjecture also mentions \"suppose that the gradients of f and g exist everywhere,\" but that's redundant due to smoothness. So, no need to include that. However, if the user wants to exclude cases where gradients are zero, but the problem statement doesn't say that. Hence, the answer should follow the user's stated problem, not their additional comments.\n\nAnother check: In the example, the assumption included two conditions on n: being integer and divisible by 7. Each on a separate line. So here, each assumption line should address one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a smooth function from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\ng is a smooth function from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\nthe Jacobian determinant of f and g is zero everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a function $h: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f = h \\circ g$.\n\nBut the user's revised conjecture includes the \"if and only if,\" so the problem is to prove both directions. However, the user mentions that the converse (⇐) is easy, so perhaps the main problem is the (⇒) direction. But the original conjecture is an equivalence, so the problem statement should reflect that. However, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the given assumptions. Here, the problem is to prove the equivalence. But in the user's problem, they are specifically asking about the converse direction. But according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the given example, which was a one-direction proof (prove A(n) is divisible by 91). So perhaps the problem is to prove one direction, the (⇒).\n\nBut the user's question title is asking if the Jacobian is zero everywhere if and only if f = h ∘ g. The problem is to prove this equivalence. So perhaps the problem statement is to prove the equivalence, but the assumptions are as above.\n\nBut the example given in the instruction had a one-direction problem. However, the user's problem is an equivalence. So in the formatted problem, the problem line should state the equivalence. Let me check the example again:\n\nExample's formatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nHere, the problem is to prove a statement under certain assumptions. Similarly, in the current case, the problem is to prove an equivalence under certain assumptions. But the example's problem was a single direction (prove divisibility). For an equivalence, perhaps the problem statement would be \"Prove that the Jacobian determinant is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function h such that f = h ∘ g.\" But the user's revised conjecture is an equivalence. However, in their attempted solution, they are focusing on the (⇒) direction.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as in the example. The example lists the assumptions and states the problem. So here, the problem would be to prove the equivalence, with the assumptions listed. However, in the example, the assumptions were specific to one direction. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, this seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem restricts to n divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the example had a mistake, or the assumptions were added to make the problem more specific. However, according to the user's instruction, the task is to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So in the example, the original problem was general (for every integer n), but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, unless the original problem had that assumption. But the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumptions seem incorrect. Perhaps the example is illustrative, not an actual correct formatting. Therefore, I need to follow the instruction, not the example's content.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user's question is titled: \"Jacobian of (f,g) is identically zero if and only if f = h ∘ g?\" and the body discusses the conjecture. The formatted problem should capture the core question without the extra discussion. The key elements are:\n\n- f and g are smooth R² → R.\n- Jacobian determinant zero everywhere.\n- Prove the equivalence: Jacobian zero iff f = h ∘ g.\n\nBut the user's main focus is on the (⇒) direction. However, the problem as stated in the title is the equivalence. So to structure it:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. f is a smooth function from R² to R.\n2. g is a smooth function from R² to R.\n3. The Jacobian determinant of f and g is zero everywhere.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Jacobian determinant of f and g is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function h: R → R such that f = h ∘ g.\n\nHowever, the example given by the user in the instruction had the problem direction under specific assumptions. But here, the problem is an equivalence. But according to the instruction's example, the problem was structured as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the problem line here should be \"Prove that the Jacobian determinant [...] is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function h [...]\".\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a one-direction proof under added assumptions. However, in this case, the user's original problem is an equivalence. Hence, the formatted problem should reflect that.\n\nBut given that the user's example might have been incorrect, it's better to follow the user's instruction strictly: \"structure that problem as the following format\" with assumptions and problem. The problem should be as stated, and assumptions are the conditions given.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nassumption:\n$f$ is a smooth function from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\n$g$ is a smooth function from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\nthe Jacobian determinant $\\left|\\frac{\\partial(f,g)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|$ is zero everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nproblem:\nProve that there exists a function $h:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f \\equiv h \\circ g$ if and only if the Jacobian determinant of $f$ and $g$ is zero everywhere.\n\nBut the user's original question's title is asking if the Jacobian is zero iff f = h ∘ g. So the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, in the example, the problem was to prove a one-direction statement under assumptions. The instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\" which includes assumptions and problem.\n\nBut the user's problem is an equivalence, so the problem line should state the equivalence. However, the example had a one-direction problem. Maybe in this case, the problem is to prove the converse direction (⇒), as the user mentions the (⇐) is easy. But the title asks about the equivalence. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem is to prove the converse direction, i.e., that if the Jacobian is zero everywhere, then f = h ∘ g. But the user's revised conjecture includes the equivalence. However, the main body of the question is about the (⇒) direction.\n\nTo resolve this, looking at the user's question:\n\nTitle: Jacobian of (f,g) is identically zero if and only if f = h ∘ g?\n\nQuestion: [...] I am wondering whether the following conjecture is true: [...] The Jacobian determinant [...] is zero everywhere if and only if there exists a function h [...] such that f ≡ h∘g. [...] I'm wondering whether the converse direction (⇒) holds as well.\n\nSo the user is proposing the equivalence but is unsure about the converse. Therefore, the problem is to determine if the converse holds, i.e., prove that if the Jacobian is zero everywhere, then f = h ∘ g. But in the problem's conjecture, it's stated as an equivalence, so the formatted problem should reflect the full equivalence.\n\nBut considering the example, which took a general problem and added assumptions, perhaps here the assumptions are the conditions for the (⇒) direction. The user is asking about the converse, so the formatted problem should be to prove the (⇒) direction under the given assumptions.\n\nGiven that, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a smooth function from R² to R.\n2. g is a smooth function from R² to R.\n3. The Jacobian determinant of (f, g) is zero everywhere.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a function h: R → R such that f = h ∘ g.\n\nThis aligns with the user's main question, which is about the converse direction (⇒). The (⇐) is already known. Therefore, the formatted problem should focus on proving the (⇒) direction under the listed assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, the user revised the conjecture to exclude trivial cases, but they don't explicitly state that in the assumptions. However, in their attempted solution, they mention that the gradients are non-zero everywhere. To make the problem non-trivial, perhaps the assumptions should include that neither f nor g is constant. But since the user's revised conjecture does not explicitly state that, it's safer to include only the assumptions given in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nassumption: \n$f$ is a smooth function from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\n$g$ is a smooth function from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\nthe Jacobian determinant $\\left|\\frac{\\partial(f,g)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|$ is zero everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nproblem:\nProve that there exists a function $h:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f = h \\circ g$.",
