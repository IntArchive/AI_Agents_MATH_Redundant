    "Content": "I am aware that there are a couple of well-known proofs of this theorem, but I'm specifically grappling with the proof given in Fraleigh's A First Course in Abstract Algebra (Theorem 9.15 in the textbook). Let $s$ be a permutation in the symmetric group of degree $n$, and let $t$ be a transposition $(i,j)$ in the same group. If $n$ is $1$ or infinite, we are done. Otherwise, ....[details of the proof omitted.] (We use the right-to-left convention to multiply permutations.) Okay, we have shown that the number of orbits of $s$ and $ts$ differ by 1. This part, I understand. But I don't understand how to infer the theorem from here. I would be very grateful if someone can help me clear my blind spot. Thank you so much! Added by Dylan. Here is Fraleigh's explanation (please don't sue me): We have shown that the number of orbits of $\\tau \\sigma$ differs from the number of orbits of $\\sigma$ by $1$. The identity permutation $\\iota$ has $n$ orbits, because each element is the only member of its orbit. Now the number of orbits of a given permutation $\\sigma \\in S_n$ differs from $n$ by either an even or odd number, but not both. Thus it is impossible to write \n  $$\n\\sigma = \\tau_1 \\tau_2 \\cdots \\tau_m \\iota\n$$\n  where the $\\tau_k$ are transpositions, in two ways, once with $m$ even and once with $m$ odd.  $\\qquad \\diamond$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\newcommand{\\orb}{\\operatorname{orbits}} \\orb(s)$ be the number of orbits in $s$. I will assume you have already showed that $\\orb(ts)$ differs from $\\orb(s)$ by $1$ for any transposition $t$. In particular, we have $$\\orb(ts) \\equiv \\orb(s) + 1 \\pmod 2 .$$ By a simple induction (on $k$), this implies that $$\\orb(t_1 t_2 \\cdots t_k s) \\equiv \\orb(s) + k \\pmod 2$$\nfor any sequence of $k$ transpositions $t_1, \\ldots, t_k$. Finally, setting $s$ to be the identity permutation, we have\n$$\n\\orb(t_1 t_2 \\cdots t_k) \\equiv n + k \\pmod 2. \\tag{$\\dagger$}\n$$ Now if a permutation $\\sigma$ is expressed as a product of transpositions as $\\sigma= t_1 t_2 \\cdots t_k$, then $(\\dagger)$ says that $k \\equiv \\orb(\\sigma) + n \\pmod 2$. In other words, in any representation of $\\sigma$ as a product of transpositions, the parity of the number of transpositions used is an invariant, equal to $(\\orb(\\sigma) + n) \\bmod 2$. This invariant of the permutation is what will shortly (in your book!) be called its signature.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about a proof from Fraleigh's algebra textbook regarding permutations. The theorem states that no permutation can be expressed both as a product of an even number of transpositions and as a product of an odd number of transpositions. The user is confused about how the number of orbits differing by 1 leads to the conclusion of the theorem.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem is then restated concisely.\n\nLooking at the original question, the key elements are:\n\n- The permutation is in the symmetric group of degree n.\n- Transpositions are used (i,j).\n- The number of orbits of s and ts differ by 1.\n- The identity permutation has n orbits.\n- The difference in the number of orbits from n must be even or odd, not both.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. s is a permutation in the symmetric group of degree n.\n2. t is a transposition (i,j) in the symmetric group.\n3. The number of orbits of s and ts differ by 1.\n4. The identity permutation ι has n orbits.\n5. The number of orbits of a permutation σ differs from n by an even or odd number, but not both.\n\nBut wait, some of these are part of the proof explanation given by Fraleigh. The problem statement itself is the theorem that no permutation can be expressed both as an even and odd number of transpositions. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the theorem. However, the theorem is a general statement about permutations in S_n. The proof uses the orbit difference, but the problem is to prove the theorem itself.\n\nSo, the original problem is to prove that no permutation can be written as both an even and odd product of transpositions. The assumptions from the proof setup include:\n\n- Permutations are in the symmetric group S_n.\n- Transpositions are elements of S_n.\n- The identity permutation has n orbits.\n- Multiplying by a transposition changes the number of orbits by 1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is referencing the proof's step where orbits differ by 1. However, the actual problem to structure is the theorem itself. The theorem's assumptions would be that permutations are in S_n (symmetric group of degree n), and transpositions are elements of S_n. The problem is to prove that no permutation can be expressed both as a product of even and odd number of transpositions.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is general for any permutation in S_n. The key assumptions for the theorem would be:\n\n- s is a permutation in the symmetric group S_n.\n- A transposition is a permutation that swaps two elements.\n- The identity permutation has n orbits (each element is its own orbit).\n- The parity (even or odd) of the number of transpositions is linked to the number of orbits via the difference from n.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is stated as the theorem, and the assumptions are the properties used in the theorem. The theorem's proof in Fraleigh's uses the orbit count, so the problem is to prove the theorem using the fact that multiplying by a transposition changes the orbit count by 1, and the identity has n orbits, which differ by even or odd.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Let σ be a permutation in the symmetric group S_n.\n- The identity permutation ι in S_n has n orbits (each element is its own orbit).\n- Multiplying a permutation by a transposition changes the number of orbits by ±1.\n- The number of orbits of any permutation in S_n differs from n by an even or odd number, but not both.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that no permutation can be expressed both as a product of an even number of transpositions and as a product of an odd number of transpositions.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is the theorem itself. The user is asking about how to infer the theorem from the orbit difference. The problem is the theorem statement. The assumptions would be the given conditions in the theorem, which are:\n\n- Permutation σ is in S_n.\n- Transpositions are elements of S_n.\n- The identity permutation has n orbits.\n- Multiplying by a transposition changes the number of orbits by 1.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions for the problem are:\n\n- For any permutation σ in S_n, the number of orbits of σ and τσ differ by 1, where τ is a transposition.\n- The identity permutation ι has exactly n orbits.\n- The difference in the number of orbits from n determines the parity of the number of transpositions.\n\nBut according to the user's question, they already accept that multiplying by a transposition changes the number of orbits by 1, but don't see how to conclude the theorem. So the problem is to use that fact to prove that permutations can't be expressed with both even and odd numbers of transpositions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include the fact that multiplying by a transposition changes orbit count by 1, and the identity has n orbits. The problem is to prove the theorem that no permutation can be written as both even and odd products.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nEach transposition in the symmetric group $S_n$ changes the number of orbits of a permutation by $\\pm 1$.\nAssumption:\nThe identity permutation in $S_n$ has $n$ orbits.\nProblem:\nProve that no permutation in $S_n$ can be expressed both as a product of an even number of transpositions and as a product of an odd number of transpositions.\n\nWait, but the first assumption is actually part of what was proven in the book. The user is stuck on how to go from the orbit difference to the theorem. But the problem as presented in the user's question is the theorem statement. So the assumptions are:\n\n- Permutations are in $S_n$.\n- The identity permutation has $n$ orbits.\n- Multiplying a permutation by a transposition changes the number of orbits by 1.\n- The number of orbits of a permutation differs from $n$ by either an even or odd number, but not both.\n\nBut the last point is actually part of the conclusion. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the theorem given the fact about orbits. So the problem's assumptions would be the premises given in the theorem.\n\nBut the theorem is a fundamental result in group theory, and the problem is to prove it using the orbit argument. Therefore, the problem is structured with the given conditions (assumptions) that:\n\n1. For any permutation σ in S_n and transposition τ, the number of orbits of τσ differs from that of σ by 1.\n2. The identity permutation ι in S_n has n orbits.\n\nProblem: Prove that no permutation can be expressed both as a product of an even number of transpositions and a product of an odd number of transpositions.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The key assumptions provided are the orbit difference when multiplying by a transposition and the identity's orbit count. Then, the problem is to prove the parity result.\n\nSo each assumption is one property:\n\nAssumption:\nFor any permutation $\\sigma \\in S_n$ and transposition $\\tau$, the number of orbits of $\\tau\\sigma$ differs from the number of orbits of $\\sigma$ by $1$.\n\nAssumption:\nThe identity permutation $\\iota \\in S_n$ has $n$ orbits.\n\nProblem:\nProve that no permutation in $S_n$ can be expressed both as a product of an even number of transpositions and as a product of an odd number of transpositions.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the required format. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object (σ and τ for the first, ι for the second).",
