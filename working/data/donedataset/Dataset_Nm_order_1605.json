    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem about proving that e is irrational following the given format. Let me read through the original question again.\n\nThe user wants to prove that e is irrational. They mention the definition of e as the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!, and they assume e is rational, leading to the equation where that sum equals a/b for some positive integers a and b. Then they multiply both sides by b to get an equation involving an infinite series. The user is asking where to go from there.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see.\n\nThe problem states that e is rational, so that's one assumption. The definition of e as the sum is given, but is that an assumption or part of the problem statement? The example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumption is that e is rational, leading to e = a/b for positive integers a and b. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. e is equal to the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!.\n2. e is rational, so there exist positive integers a and b such that e = a/b.\n\nWait, the example included each assumption as a separate line. The first assumption here is the definition of e, which is part of the problem's setup. But in the example, the user included the divisibility condition as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. But perhaps the user made an error in the example. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumption is that e is rational, which is part of the proof by contradiction. The problem is to prove that e is irrational, so the assumption for contradiction is that e is rational. The other part is the definition of e as the infinite sum. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\ne is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!,\ne is a rational number (i.e., there exist positive integers a and b such that e = a/b).\n\nProblem: Prove that e is irrational.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe the user intended to filter out some conditions. But perhaps in this case, we need to list the assumptions given in the problem setup. The user provided the problem statement as \"Prove that e is irrational\", and in the question, they mention the definition of e and the assumption that e is rational. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. e is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!.\n2. e is rational, so there exist positive integers a and b such that e = a/b.\n\nBut in the example, the user included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Maybe in that example, they were focusing on a specific case. Hmm. Maybe the key is that any conditions needed for the problem to be posed. For the e problem, the main assumption for the proof by contradiction is that e is rational. The definition of e as the sum is part of the problem's premise. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\ne is equal to the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!,\nThere exist positive integers a and b such that e = a/b.\n\nProblem: Prove that e is irrational.\n\nBut I need to check if each assumption is applied to one object. The first assumption applies to e, the second also applies to e. But the example had two assumptions about n. So perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as starting from the assumption that e is rational (i.e., e = a/b for some a, b positive integers), and using the definition of e as the sum. So the assumptions are:\n\n- e = sum_{n=0}^infty 1/n!,\n- e is rational, i.e., e = a/b for some positive integers a and b.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\ne is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!,\ne is a rational number (i.e., there exist positive integers a and b such that e = a/b).\n\nProblem: Prove that e is irrational.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that e is irrational, so the actual problem statement is \"Prove that e is irrational\", and the assumptions are the given conditions. But in the example, the problem was rephrased as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n. So perhaps the example was incorrect, but I need to follow the user's format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are all the given conditions in the problem. The original problem says \"Prove that e is irrational. Recall that e = sum..., and assume e is rational...\". So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. e is defined as the sum_{n=0}^infty 1/n!,\n2. e is rational (for contradiction),\n3. a and b are positive integers such that e = a/b.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\ne is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!,\ne is a rational number,\nThere exist positive integers a and b such that e = a/b.\n\nBut perhaps the third is redundant with the second. Since if e is rational, then such a and b exist. So maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- The definition of e,\n- The assumption (for contradiction) that e is rational.\n\nBut the user's example included two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So each is a separate condition on n.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- e is defined as sum_{n=0}^infty 1/n!,\n- e is rational (i.e., there exists integers a, b > 0 such that e = a/b).\n\nBut to split them into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\ne is equal to the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!,\ne is a rational number,\nThere exist positive integers a and b such that e = a/b.\n\nBut the third is a consequence of the second. However, in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So perhaps the user wants to list even implied conditions. For example, in the e problem, the fact that a and b are positive integers is part of the assumption. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\ne is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!,\ne is rational,\na and b are positive integers such that e = a/b.\n\nBut each assumption should be applied to one object. So:\n\n1. e is defined as sum_{n=0}^infty 1/n!,\n2. e is rational,\n3. a is a positive integer,\n4. b is a positive integer,\n5. e = a/b.\n\nBut that might be splitting it too much. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe mathematical constant e is defined as the infinite series sum_{n=0}^infty 1/n!,\ne is a rational number, i.e., there exist positive integers a and b where e = a/b.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\ne is equal to the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!,\ne is a rational number,\nThere exist positive integers a and b such that e = a/b.\n\nBut the last two could be combined. Alternatively, the problem is to prove e is irrational, so the assumptions are the given premises. The problem as presented in the question starts by recalling the definition of e, then assuming for contradiction that e is rational, hence e = a/b. So the key assumptions are the definition of e and the assumption that it's rational. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\ne is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/n!,\ne is a rational number.\n\nProblem: Prove that e is irrational.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was rephrased to include the specific expression. Here, the problem is to prove e is irrational, and the assumptions are the definition of e and the assumption of rationality (for contradiction). But the user's example included specific conditions on n, which may be part of the problem's hypothesis. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n1. e is defined by the given series,\n2. e is rational (for contradiction).\n\nThus, the formatted problem should list these assumptions.",
