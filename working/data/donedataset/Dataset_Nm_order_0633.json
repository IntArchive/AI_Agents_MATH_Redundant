    "Content": "The polynomial $$f(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n           (x^2-y^2)(y(4x^2-1)+2) \\\\ 2xy(y(4x^2-1)+2) \\\\ x^3-3xy^2\n\\end{bmatrix} $$ maps the circle $\\left\\{ (x, y) \\mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\right\\}$ to a trefoil knot , and I suspect that this is the lowest degree polynomial that can map the circle to a nontrivial knot- i.e. that there are no degree $4$ polynomials that can map the circle to a knot. However after significant thought I have no idea how to approach proving this. With the stick number, which feels analogous, it is possible to reduce the problem of $n=4$ or $5$ to finitely many cases, but that doesn't seem possible here. I would like either a proof or a method of approaching a proof for this. I would also appreciate a way of proving that this is the lowest degree polynomial that produces a trefoil knot, which I am equally stumped by. It seems natural that degree $5$ would be minimal as the trefoil knot is the simplest knot and is the $(3,2)$ torus knot, but I have no deeper reasoning besides that it feels like with lower degree polynomials you can't fit enough bends in. The way I produced this polynomial was starting with a this parameterisation of the trefoil knot and expanding for example $\\sin 3\\theta = 4 \\sin \\theta \\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin \\theta$ so the formula is all in terms of $\\cos \\theta$ and $\\sin \\theta$ , which for the circle are just $x$ and $y$ . Edit: apparently there is a degree $3$ polynomial that works, so now the objective is to prove no degree $2$ polynomials work- hopefully that's more tractable.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will prove that there is no degree $2$ embedding of a nontrivial knot. Assume the contrary. By applying the substitution $x = \\cos t, y = \\sin t$ , we get a periodic parametrization $g \\colon [0, 2\\pi) \\to \\mathbb R^3$ , which can be expressed in the form $$\ng(t) := \\vec{v_1}\\cos 2t + \\vec{v_2} \\sin 2t + \\vec{v_3} \\cos t + \\vec{v_4} \\sin t + \\vec{v_5}.\n$$ Up to an affine transformation, we can assume $$\ng(t) := \\vec{a}\\cos 2t + \\vec{b} \\sin 2t + \\hat{x}\\cos t + \\hat{y}\\sin t.\n$$ Let $W:=\\operatorname{span}(\\hat{x}, \\hat{y})$ and $Z:=\\operatorname{span}(\\vec{a}, \\vec{b})$ . If $Z \\subseteq W$ , then the knot is a (non-self-intersecting) plane curve, i.e. the unknot. Hence, we can assume $Z \\not\\subseteq W$ . Let $L := Z \\cap W$ . Up to rotating the knot around $\\hat z$ and shifting the parameter $t$ , we may further assume that $L = \\operatorname{span}(\\hat y)$ . Take $\\vec v \\in Z\\setminus L$ and  consider a projection $p\\colon \\mathbb R^3 \\twoheadrightarrow \\mathbb R^2$ which fixes $W$ and sends $\\vec v$ to zero. Then the composition $p\\circ g$ has the form $$\np(g(t)) = \\hat{x} \\cos t + \\hat{y}\\,(\\sin t + \\lambda \\cos(2t + \\phi))).\n$$ Let us find the self-intersections of this curve on $[0, 2\\pi)$ . If $p(g(t)) = p(g(t'))$ for $t < t'$ , since $\\cos t$ is $2$ -to- $1$ , we have $0 < t < \\pi$ and $t' = 2\\pi-t$ . But then \\begin{align}\n\\sin t + \\lambda \\cos(2t + \\phi) &= \n\\sin (2\\pi-t) + \\lambda \\cos(2(2\\pi-t) + \\phi) \\\\\n&= -\\sin t + \\lambda \\cos(2t - \\phi) \\\\\n\\end{align} that is, $2\\sin t = \\lambda \\cos(2t - \\phi) - \\lambda \\cos(2t + \\phi) = 4\\lambda \\sin \\phi \\sin t\\cos t$ . But this equality can hold at most once, i.e. when $\\cos t = 1/(2\\lambda\\sin\\phi)$ . Hence, generically in $\\vec{v}$ , we get a diagram with one crossing, which cannot represent a nontrivial knot. EDIT: There is also a degenerate case when $\\dim Z = 1$ and $\\dim L = 0$ . However, if we take a projection onto $W$ with kernel $Z$ , we get a circle, which cannot be the diagram of a nontrivial knot. EDIT: If $\\vec{v_3}$ and $\\vec{v_4}$ are linearly dependent (thanks @Joshua), and $\\operatorname{span}(\\vec{v_1}, \\vec{v_2}, \\vec{v_3}, \\vec{v_4}) = \\mathbb R^3$ , we can assume up to affine transformations and parameter shifts $$\ng(t) = \\hat x \\cos 2t + \\hat y \\sin 2t + \\hat z \\sin t.\n$$ Projecting onto $\\operatorname{span}(\\hat y, \\hat z)$ , we get a curve $(\\sin 2t, \\sin t)$ . It is not hard to see that this is a smooth curve with only one self-intersection at $(0,0)$ , which gives a diagram with only one crossing.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about determining the lowest degree polynomial that can turn a circle into a nontrivial knot, specifically focusing on whether a degree 2 polynomial can do that. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentions a polynomial f(x,y) of degree 5 that maps the circle to a trefoil knot. They suspect that degree 5 is minimal but later mention an edit stating a degree 3 polynomial exists, shifting the focus to proving no degree 2 polynomial works. \n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n1. The polynomial f(x,y) has components defined as given in the problem. But since the problem is about the lowest degree, maybe the key assumption is about the degree of the polynomial. However, the specific polynomial is an example, not an assumption. The main assumption is the problem's context: mapping a circle into a nontrivial knot using a polynomial. \n\nWait, the problem now is to prove that there's no degree 2 polynomial that can map the circle into a nontrivial knot. The user wants to structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about the properties of n (integer, divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions would be about the polynomial's degree and the circle. \n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n- The polynomial has degree 2.\n- The polynomial maps the circle {(x, y) | x² + y² = 1} into a knot. But the problem is to show that such a polynomial of degree 2 cannot produce a nontrivial knot. Wait, the problem is to prove that there are no degree 2 polynomials that can map the circle to a nontrivial knot. So the assumption would be considering a polynomial of degree 2 that maps the circle into a knot. Wait, but the problem is to show that such a polynomial cannot exist (i.e., the knot must be trivial). Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial is of degree 2.\n- The polynomial maps the circle {(x, y) | x² + y² = 1} into a knot.\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a knot is necessarily trivial, hence no degree 2 polynomial can produce a nontrivial knot. So the problem statement would be: Prove that there is no degree 2 polynomial mapping the circle to a nontrivial knot.\n\nWait, the user's edit says the original thought was degree 5, but now someone found a degree 3, so the problem is to prove no degree 2 exists. So the problem as per the user's latest edit is: \"Prove that there are no degree 2 polynomials that can map the circle to a nontrivial knot.\"\n\nSo the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed. So each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Let me list them.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The polynomial is of degree 2.\n- The domain of the polynomial is the circle {(x, y) | x² + y² = 1}.\n- The image of the circle under the polynomial is a knot (a closed, non-self-intersecting loop embedded in three-dimensional space).\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a knot must be trivial. Therefore, the problem statement is to prove that any such polynomial of degree 2 cannot produce a nontrivial knot.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n (integer and divisible by 7). Here, the key assumption is that the polynomial is degree 2 and maps the circle into a knot. The problem is to prove that the resulting knot is trivial.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial has degree 2.\n- The polynomial maps the circle {(x, y) | x² + y² = 1} into a knot.\n\nProblem: Prove that the image of the circle under such a polynomial is a trivial knot.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that there is no degree 2 polynomial mapping the circle to a nontrivial knot.\" Depending on how the user wants to present it. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question says: \"It seems natural that degree 5 would be minimal... Edit: apparently there is a degree 3 polynomial that works, so now the objective is to prove no degree 2 polynomials work- hopefully that's more tractable.\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that no degree 2 polynomial can map the circle to a nontrivial knot. So the problem statement is: Prove that there does not exist a degree 2 polynomial that maps the circle to a nontrivial knot.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial is of degree 2.\n- The domain is the circle {(x, y) | x² + y² = 1}.\n- The image under the polynomial is a knot.\n\nBut perhaps more precise: The problem is to show that if such a polynomial exists of degree 2 mapping the circle to a knot, then the knot must be trivial. Alternatively, to show that such a polynomial cannot produce a nontrivial knot. The original question is asking for a proof that there are no degree 2 polynomials that can map the circle to a nontrivial knot. So the problem is to show the non-existence.\n\nSo the assumptions would be that we consider polynomials of degree 2, mapping the circle into a knot. The problem is to show that any such image is a trivial knot, hence no nontrivial knot can be achieved with degree 2.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions should only list the conditions given. Since the problem is to prove that no degree 2 polynomial can produce a nontrivial knot, the assumptions would be the properties that the polynomial must satisfy, which are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial is of degree 2.\n- The polynomial maps the circle {(x, y) | x² + y² = 1} into a knot.\n\nProblem: Prove that the image of the circle under such a polynomial is a trivial knot (i.e., there does not exist a degree 2 polynomial that maps the circle to a nontrivial knot).\n\nBut to match the example given, where the assumptions list the conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7), here the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial has degree 2.\n- The domain of the polynomial is the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n- The image of the polynomial is a knot.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such a knot must be trivial, hence no nontrivial exists. But perhaps the problem statement is phrased as \"Prove that there does not exist a degree 2 polynomial mapping the circle to a nontrivial knot.\"\n\nBut in the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the problem statement here would be similar.\n\nSo the user's example had assumptions listed as properties of the variables involved. In this case, the polynomial's degree and the domain (circle). The problem is the actual statement to prove.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial is of degree 2.\n- The polynomial maps the circle $\\{(x, y) \\mid x^2 + y^2 = 1\\}$ into a knot.\n\nProblem: Prove that there does not exist such a polynomial that maps the circle to a nontrivial knot.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to show that any such polynomial must result in a trivial knot, then the problem would be \"Prove that the image of the circle under any degree 2 polynomial is a trivial knot.\"\n\nBut the original question states: \"the objective is to prove no degree 2 polynomials work\", i.e., there are no degree 2 polynomials that map the circle to a nontrivial knot. So the problem statement is to prove non-existence.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial is of degree 2.\n- The domain of the polynomial is the circle $\\{(x, y) \\mid x^2 + y^2 = 1\\}$.\n- The image of the circle under the polynomial is a knot.\n\nProblem: Prove that there does not exist a degree 2 polynomial that maps the circle to a nontrivial knot.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was split into separate lines for each property. So each assumption is a single line, one property per line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial has degree 2.\n- The polynomial maps the circle $\\{(x, y) \\mid x^2 + y^2 = 1\\}$ to a knot.\n\nProblem: Prove that there does not exist such a polynomial resulting in a nontrivial knot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as \"Prove that any degree 2 polynomial mapping the circle to a knot must produce a trivial knot.\"\n\nI think the key is to split assumptions into individual conditions. The problem is the statement to prove, which is the non-existence of a degree 2 polynomial that yields a nontrivial knot.\n\nSo final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n- The polynomial has degree 2.\n- The polynomial maps the circle $\\{(x, y) \\mid x^2 + y^2 = 1\\}$ to a knot.\n\nProblem: Prove that there does not exist a degree 2 polynomial that maps the circle to a nontrivial knot.",
