    "Content": "A question was raised in our class about the non-existence of product in a category. The two examples that came up in the discussion was the category of smooth manifolds with boundary and the category of fields. But I cannot formally prove why categorical product does not exist in these categories. I can see that category of finite fields cannot have infinite products due to cardinality reasons, but I would like to know why category of fields cannot even have finite products. Is there any other simple example of a category without (finite) products? Any help regarding this appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For fields the most basic problem is fields of different characteristic.  If $K$ and $L$ are fields, then the product $K\\times L$ (if it existed) would have to be a field that can map into both $K$ and $L$, which means in particular it has the same characteristic as both $K$ and $L$, which is impossible if $K$ and $L$ have different characteristic. Even if you restrict to fields of a fixed characteristic, however, you still don't have products.  For instance, in the category of fields of some fixed characteristic, let $K$ be any field with a non-identity endomorphism $e:K\\to K$.  Then I claim there is no product $K\\times K$.  For suppose there were; call it $P$, and let $p:P\\to K$ and $q:P\\to K$ be the two projections.  Considering $L=K$ and the identity maps $f=g=1:L\\to K$, by the universal property of the product there must exist $h:L\\to P$ such that $ph=f$ and $qh=g$.  Since $f$ and $g$ are the identity and every map of fields is injective, this means that $h$ must be an isomorphism and $p=q$ is its inverse.  But now consider $g'=e:L\\to K$; there is then an $h':L\\to K$ such that $ph'=f$ and $qh'=g'$.  Since $p=q$, this means $f=g'$, which is a contradiction since we assumed $e\\neq 1$. The case of smooth manifolds with boundary is fairly subtle (indeed, the category of smooth manifolds has some limits you might not expect it to have).  Let me sketch a proof that there is no product $[0,1)\\times[0,1)$ in the category of smooth manifolds with boundary.  Suppose you had such a product $P$. By considering maps from the $1$-point manifold to $P$, you can identify the underlying set of $P$ with the cartesian product $[0,1)\\times[0,1)$.  By considering smooth maps from $\\mathbb{R}$, you can show that $P$ is connected.  By considering smooth maps from $\\mathbb{R}^2$, you can show that $P$ is $2$-dimensional and that $\\{0\\}\\times [0,1)\\cup[0,1)\\times\\{0\\}$ must be its boundary (here we use that a point is in the interior of a $2$-manifold iff there is an injective smooth map from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to the manifold whose image contains the point but no such map from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for any $n>2$).  Again using smooth maps from $\\mathbb{R}$, you can show that this boundary must be connected, and that (via the classification of $1$-manifolds) in fact it must be diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.  Such a diffeomorphism $\\mathbb{R}\\to P$ onto the boundary then gives a smooth injection $i:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$ whose image is $\\{0\\}\\times [0,1)\\cup[0,1)\\times\\{0\\}$, and $i$ has the property that every smooth map $j:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^2$ whose image is contained in $\\{0\\}\\times [0,1)\\cup[0,1)\\times\\{0\\}$ factors smoothly through $i$.  You can show that no such $i$ exists by examining what it does near the corner: assuming without loss of generality that $i(0)=(0,0)$, then all the derivatives of $i$ must vanish at $0$.  But then $j(x)=i(\\sqrt[3]{x})$ is smooth and does not factor through $i$, which is a contradiction. For other examples of categories without products, it is very easy to get examples if you look at small categories you think of as an individual algebraic structure, rather than categories like \"the category of all structures of a certain kind\".  For instance, you can form a category with any set of objects and no non-identity morphisms, and this doesn't have products of distinct objects.  Or you can take a monoid and consider it as a category with one object, and it will rarely have a product of two copies of the object.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Examples of categories without products,\" and the user is asking about why certain categories like smooth manifolds with boundary and fields don't have categorical products. They mention trying to prove the non-existence formally and also ask for other simple examples.\n\nNow, according to the example given, the Assumptions section should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The Problem section is the actual problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem in the example, the assumptions were about the integer n and its divisibility by 7. For the current question, I need to identify the assumptions. The user mentions two categories: smooth manifolds with boundary and fields. They also mention the category of finite fields having cardinality issues but wanting to know why fields can't have finite products. Additionally, they ask for other simple examples.\n\nBut wait, the task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem. The main problem here is to show that the category of fields doesn't have finite products and perhaps provide another example. However, the original question also asks for other examples, but the user's formatted example in the prompt seems to focus on the specific problem. Maybe the assumptions here are the categories under consideration. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is about categories, so the assumptions would be the properties of the categories in question.\n\nWait, but the question is asking why these categories don't have products. So the assumptions would be the definitions or properties of those categories. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\n- The category of smooth manifolds with boundary.\n- The category of fields.\n- The category of finite fields.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe category of smooth manifolds with boundary is considered.\nThe category of fields is considered.\nFinite products are considered in the category of fields.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that these categories do not have (finite) products. However, the original question also asks for other examples. But according to the example, the problem should be the main question to answer. The user's example extracted the core problem (proving divisibility) and listed assumptions (n is integer, divisible by 7). Here, the core problem is to prove that the category of fields does not have finite products and to provide other examples. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had extra text but was condensed into the problem statement. The assumptions were the conditions on n. Here, the problem is to \"prove that the categorical product does not exist in these categories\" and \"Is there any other simple example of a category without (finite) products?\"\n\nBut the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". So the problem would be the main question. The assumptions are the given conditions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The category of smooth manifolds with boundary is considered.\n- The category of fields is considered.\n- Finite products are considered in the category of fields.\n\nProblem: Prove that the categorical product does not exist in the category of fields and provide another example of a category without finite products.\n\nBut wait, the original question also mentions the category of smooth manifolds with boundary, but the user's main focus seems to be on fields. Maybe the assumptions are the categories in question, and the problem is to show they don't have products. However, the example in the prompt included specific mathematical conditions. Here, the assumptions are more about the categories being discussed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to show why the categorical product does not exist in the category of fields, and the assumptions are that we're working within those categories. But the example given in the user's prompt had assumptions that were conditions on n (the variable in the problem). Here, the \"objects\" are the categories themselves. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the properties that define the categories. For example, the category of fields has all morphisms as field homomorphisms. But that might be part of the problem statement. The user's example had the problem as the mathematical statement to prove, and the assumptions as the conditions on the variables. Here, the problem is more about category theory. Let me try to structure it:\n\nAssumption:\n- The category of fields is considered.\n- Morphisms in the category of fields are field homomorphisms.\n- Finite products are considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the category of fields does not have finite products and provide another example of a category without products.\n\nBut the original question also mentions smooth manifolds with boundary. Maybe the problem is to show that both categories (smooth manifolds with boundary and fields) do not have products, and provide another example. However, the user's example focused on a specific problem (divisibility) with specific assumptions. The key here is to extract the core problem and list the assumptions. The user's question has two parts: 1) Why don't these categories have products? 2) Any other examples?\n\nBut the format requires a single problem. Maybe split into two problems? But the example has one problem. Perhaps the main problem is to prove that the category of fields does not have finite products, with the assumption being that we're working in the category of fields. Then the other example is an additional part. But according to the user's instruction, the answer should follow the format with Assumption and Problem. Let me look at the original question again:\n\n\"Examples of a categories without products. A question was raised in our class about the non-existence of product in a category. The two examples that came up in the discussion was the category of smooth manifolds with boundary and the category of fields. But I cannot formally prove why categorical product does not exist in these categories. I can see that category of finite fields cannot have infinite products due to cardinality reasons, but I would like to know why category of fields cannot even have finite products. Is there any other simple example of a category without (finite) products? Any help regarding this appreciated.\"\n\nSo the main problems are:\n\n1. Prove that the categorical product does not exist in the category of smooth manifolds with boundary and the category of fields.\n\n2. Provide another example of a category without finite products.\n\nBut the user's example had a single problem. To fit into the format, perhaps structure the problem as the two parts. However, the example given in the prompt had the problem as a single statement. Maybe the assumptions are the two categories, and the problem is to prove they don't have products and provide another example.\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions as the conditions on n, and the problem as the statement to prove. Here, the assumptions would be the categories under consideration. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The category of smooth manifolds with boundary is considered.\n- The category of fields is considered.\n- Finite products are considered in the category of fields.\n\nProblem: Prove that the categorical product does not exist in these categories and provide another example of a category without finite products.\n\nBut the original question also separates the finite fields case due to cardinality, but the user is asking about the category of fields (not necessarily finite) not having even finite products. So maybe the assumptions should specify that we're looking at the category of fields (all fields, not just finite) and considering finite products. The category of smooth manifolds with boundary is another assumption. Then the problem is to prove that these categories don't have products and to give another example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps split into two separate problems, but the format seems to allow one problem. Alternatively, the problem is to \"Prove that the category of fields does not have finite products and provide another example of a category without products,\" with the assumptions being the categories in question. But I think the key here is that the user is asking two things: why fields don't have finite products, and another example. The category of smooth manifolds with boundary is another example they mentioned but also can't prove. So maybe the problem is to show why the category of fields doesn't have finite products and provide another example (like smooth manifolds with boundary), but the original question is asking for help in proving both examples and finding another. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. But according to the example, the problem should be concise. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\n- The category of fields is considered.\n- The category of smooth manifolds with boundary is considered.\n- Finite products are considered in the category of fields.\n\nProblem: Prove that the categorical product does not exist in the category of fields and the category of smooth manifolds with boundary, and provide another example of a category without finite products.\n\nBut maybe the problem is to answer the original question, which is to provide examples (including the two mentioned) and prove why they don't have products. However, the original question already states the examples, so the problem is to formally prove why they don't have products and provide another example. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The categorical product is considered in the category of fields.\n- The categorical product is considered in the category of smooth manifolds with boundary.\n\nProblem: Prove that the categorical product does not exist in the category of fields and the category of smooth manifolds with boundary, and provide another example of a category without finite products.\n\nBut the assumptions should be specific properties. Alternatively, each assumption is a category. The problem is to show they don't have products and find another example. But maybe the problem is split into two parts: proving for fields and providing another example, but the user wants it in one problem statement. Alternatively, focusing on the main part the user is stuck on: why fields don't have finite products. The other example (smooth manifolds) is also part of the problem, but the user is also asking for another example. This is a bit complex. Let me look at the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, divisible by 7) and the problem as proving divisibility. Here, the original problem is about examples of categories without products, specifically fields and smooth manifolds with boundary, and asking for a proof and another example.\n\nGiven the user's instruction to filter unrelated information, maybe the key problem is about the category of fields not having finite products, and the other example. The smooth manifolds with boundary might be another example, but the user can't prove either. However, perhaps the main focus is on fields, as the user mentions finite fields and cardinality but wants to know about general fields.\n\nSo, structuring the problem as focusing on the category of fields:\n\nAssumption:\n- The category of fields is considered.\n- Finite products are considered in the category of fields.\n\nProblem: Prove that the category of fields does not have finite products and provide another example of a category without products.\n\nBut the original question also mentions smooth manifolds with boundary. Maybe include that in the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The category of smooth manifolds with boundary is considered.\n- The category of fields is considered.\n- Finite products are considered in the category of fields.\n\nProblem: Prove that the categorical product does not exist in these categories and provide another example of a category without finite products.\n\nThis seems to capture the original question's intent. The assumptions list the categories under consideration and the type of products (finite), and the problem is to prove non-existence and provide another example.\n\nYes, I think that's the way to go. The user mentions two categories and wants to prove they don't have products, plus another example. So the assumptions list those two categories and the consideration of finite products for fields. The problem is to prove for these two and provide another example.",
