    "Content": "I am trying to understand the proof of Lemma 1.35 (Smooth Manifold Chart Lemma) of John. M. Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds , 2nd Edition. The Lemma is an existence-and-uniqueness-lemma. I understand the existence part of it but not the uniqueness part. Here I state the Lemma and the proof of the existence part (the proof is essentially just a detailed version of the proof given in Lee's book.) LEMMA. Let $M$ be a set and $\\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha\\in J}$ be a collection of subsets of $M$ , along with maps $\\varphi_\\alpha:U_\\alpha\\to\\mathbf R^n$ , such that the following properties are satisfied: (i) $\\forall \\alpha\\in J$ : $\\varphi_\\alpha$ is an injective map and $\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha)$ is open in $\\mathbf R^n$ . (ii) $\\forall \\alpha,\\beta\\in J$ : the sets $\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta)$ and $\\varphi_\\beta(U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta)$ are open in $\\mathbf R^n$ . (iii) $\\forall\\alpha,\\beta\\in J$ : $U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta\\neq \\emptyset\n\t\t\t\\quad\n\t\t\t\\Rightarrow\n\t\t\t\\quad \\varphi_\\beta\\circ\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}:\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta)\\to \\varphi_\\beta(U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta)$ is smooth. (iv) Countably many of the sets $U_\\alpha$ cover $M$ . (v) $\n\\left.\n\\begin{array}{c}\np,q\\in M\\\\\np\\neq q\n\\end{array}\n\\right\\}\n\\quad\n\\Rightarrow\n\\quad\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\exists \\alpha\\in J\\text{ such that } p,q\\in U_\\alpha,\\quad\\text{ or}\\\\\n\\exists \\alpha,\\beta\\in J\\text{ such that } p\\in U_\\alpha, q\\in U_\\beta \\text{ and } U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta=\\emptyset\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n$ Then $M$ has a unique manifold structure such that each pair $(U_\\alpha,\\varphi_\\alpha)$ is a smooth chart. PROOF. Let $\\mathcal B=\\{\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}(V):\\alpha\\in J, V\\text{ open in } \\mathbf R^n\\}$ . Claim 1: $\\mathcal B$ forms a basis for $M$ . Proof: We use $(i)$ --- $(iv)$ in this proof. \nFrom $(iv)$ we see that the elements of $\\mathcal B$ cover $M$ .\nNow let $\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}(V)$ and $\\varphi_\\beta^{-1}(W)$ be two elements of $\\mathcal B$ , where $V$ and $W$ are open in $\\mathbf R^n$ .\nTo show that $\\mathcal B$ forms a basis, it is enough to show that $ \\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}(V)\\cap\\varphi_\\beta^{-1}(W)$ itself lies in $\\mathcal B$ .\nNote that \\begin{equation*}\n\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}(V)\\cap \\varphi_\\beta^{-1}(W)=\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}\\Big(V\\cap(\\varphi_\\beta\\circ\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1})^{-1}(W)\\Big)\n\\tag{1}\n\\end{equation*} But by (iii), $\\varphi_\\beta\\circ\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}$ is continuous, and therefore $(\\varphi_\\beta\\circ\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1})^{-1}(W)$ is open in $\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta)$ .\nBy (ii), $\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta)$ is open in $\\mathbf R^n$ and therefore $(\\varphi_\\beta\\circ\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1})^{-1}(W)$ is open in $\\mathbf R^n$ .\nUsing this in $(1)$ , we immediately see that $\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}(V)\\cap\\varphi_\\beta^{-1}(W)$ is in $\\mathcal B$ .\nThis settles the claim. Let $\\tau$ be the topology generated on $M$ by $\\mathcal B$ .\nBy definition of $\\mathcal B$ , each function $\\varphi_\\alpha$ is a homeomorphism onto its image.\nThus $(M,\\tau)$ is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$ . Claim 2: $(M,\\tau)$ is Hausdorff. Proof: This uses $(v)$ . Let $p,q\\in M$ with $p\\neq q$ . If $\\exists \\alpha,\\beta\\in J$ such that $p\\in U_\\alpha, q\\in U_\\beta$ and $U_\\alpha\\cap U_\\beta=\\emptyset$ , then we have nothing to prove. The other possibility if that $\\exists \\alpha\\in J$ such that $p,q\\in U_\\alpha$ .\n            Now since $\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha)$ is open in $\\mathbf R^n$ , there exist disjoint open sets $V$ and $W$ open in $\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha)$ containing $p$ and $q$ respectively. The neighborhoods $\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}(V)$ and $\\varphi_\\alpha^{-1}(W)$ separate $p$ and $q$ in $M$ . Thus the claim is settled. Claim 3: $(M,\\tau)$ is second countable. Proof: Note that since $\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha)$ is second countable, and since $\\varphi_\\alpha:U_\\alpha\\to\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha)$ is a homeomorphism, we must have $U_\\alpha$ is second countable. The proof is now immediate from $(iv)$ and Lemma given at the bottom. The above working shows that $(M,\\tau)$ is a topological $n$ -manifold. Now from $(iii)$ it is clear that $\\{(U_\\alpha,\\varphi_\\alpha)\\}_{\\alpha\\in J}$ is a smooth atlas on $M$ , giving $M$ a smooth structure. Now we need to establish that this is the only smooth structure on $M$ such that each $\\varphi_\\alpha:U_\\alpha\\to\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha)$ is a smooth chart on $M$ and here I am stuck.\nIn fact what Lee writes is that \"It is clear that this topology and smooth structure are the unique ones satisfying the conclusions (conditions?) of the lemma.\"\nCan somebody please explain this to me. LEMMA. Let $X$ be a topological space and $\\{U_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbf N}$ be a countable open cover of $X$ such that each $U_i$ is second countable in the subspace topology. Then $X$ is second countable.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "About the topology: Every $(U_\\alpha,\\varphi_\\alpha)$ needs to be a chart, meaning that $\\varphi_\\alpha$ is a homeomorphism on its image, so for every subset $V\\subset U_\\alpha$, $V$ is open if and only if $\\varphi_\\alpha(V)\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$ is open. Since the $U_\\alpha$s cover $M$, it means that the collection of open subsets of elements in $\\{\\varphi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha)\\}$ induces a basis of a topology on $M$, thus the topology is indeed unique. Regarding the smooth structure: The thing is that given an atlas $\\{U_\\alpha,\\varphi_\\alpha\\}$, it always determines a unique smooth structure. To see this, note that if $(V,\\psi),(V',\\psi')$ both \"agree\" with the given atlas (i.e. all obtained transition maps are smooth), it follows from the chain rule that these two charts also agree with each other. Hence there is no choice when extending an atlas to a smooth structure - one just adds every chart that agrees with the given atlas. Once again, since the $U_\\alpha$'s cover $M$, the given collection is an atlas and it thus induces a unique smooth structure.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and extract the assumptions and problem from the provided Math Stack Exchange question.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The user is asking about the uniqueness part of the Smooth Manifold Chart Lemma in John M. Lee's book. They understand the existence part but are stuck on the uniqueness. The lemma states several conditions (i) to (v), and the proof outlines the existence of the manifold structure but the user is confused about why it's unique.\n\nThe task is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about the integer n and its divisibility by 7. So I need to parse the lemma's conditions (i) to (v) and break them down into individual assumptions.\n\nLet me go through each condition in the lemma:\n\n(i) For each α in J, φ_α is injective and φ_α(U_α) is open in R^n. This can be split into two assumptions: one about injectivity and another about the image being open.\n\nWait, the example had each assumption as a single line. So perhaps each part of the lemma's conditions (i)-(v) should be individual assumptions. Let's check:\n\nOriginal lemma's conditions:\n\n(i) φ_α is injective and φ_α(U_α) is open in R^n. This is two separate properties but stated as one condition. The example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two lines. So here, maybe split (i) into two assumptions: injectivity and openness of the image.\n\nSimilarly, (ii) For α, β in J, the sets φ_α(U_α ∩ U_β) and φ_β(U_α ∩ U_β) are open in R^n. This is about two sets being open, but it's a single condition. But each applies to different images, so maybe split into two assumptions: one for φ_α(U_α ∩ U_β) being open and another for φ_β(U_α ∩ U_β) being open. However, the example combined multiple properties if they relate to the same object. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", both about n. Here, (ii) is about two different images. Maybe it's better to have one assumption stating that for all α, β, both φ_α and φ_β images of the intersection are open. But the user's example split even when same object. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each condition (i)-(v) as listed in the lemma becomes one assumption each. But looking at the example, the user took the original problem's assumptions and split them into individual lines. The original problem in the example had \"for every integer n\", which became \"n is an integer\", and the problem statement had \"is divisible by 91\", but the example's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Wait, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem in the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that would restrict n to multiples of 7, which contradicts the original problem. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction, which is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem, the lemma has five conditions (i)-(v). Let's parse each:\n\n(i) For all α in J, φ_α is injective and φ_α(U_α) is open in R^n. So two separate properties here: injectivity of each φ_α, and openness of each φ_α(U_α). These can be two separate assumptions.\n\n(ii) For all α, β in J, φ_α(U_α ∩ U_β) and φ_β(U_α ∩ U_β) are open in R^n. This can be two assumptions: for any α, β, φ_α's image of the intersection is open, and similarly for φ_β. Alternatively, since it's a joint condition, maybe list it as one assumption.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they split even when same object. For example, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\" which became \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So splitting even if they are about the same object. Therefore, here, condition (ii) would be two separate assumptions: one about φ_α(U_α ∩ U_β) being open and another about φ_β(U_α ∩ U_β) being open. But wait, in the original lemma, (ii) is written as both sets are open. So perhaps it's better to list them as two separate assumptions.\n\n(iii) For any α, β in J, if U_α ∩ U_β is non-empty, then the transition map φ_β ∘ φ_α^{-1} is smooth. This is a single condition, so one assumption.\n\n(iv) Countably many U_α cover M. One assumption.\n\n(v) The Hausdorff condition: for any two distinct points p, q in M, either there exists α such that both p and q are in U_α, or there exist α, β with p in U_α, q in U_β, and U_α ∩ U_β is empty. This is a single condition, so one assumption.\n\nSo total assumptions would be:\n\nFrom (i): two assumptions (injective and image open).\n\nFrom (ii): two assumptions (images under φ_α and φ_β of intersections are open).\n\nFrom (iii): one assumption (transition maps smooth).\n\nFrom (iv): one assumption (countable cover).\n\nFrom (v): one assumption (Hausdorff condition).\n\nSo total 7 assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user split two properties even though they were part of the same condition. So I think following that approach, each individual property is a separate line.\n\nSo let me list them:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. For each α in J, φ_α is injective.\n\n2. For each α in J, φ_α(U_α) is open in R^n.\n\n3. For all α, β in J, φ_α(U_α ∩ U_β) is open in R^n.\n\n4. For all α, β in J, φ_β(U_α ∩ U_β) is open in R^n.\n\n5. For all α, β in J with U_α ∩ U_β ≠ ∅, the transition map φ_β ∘ φ_α^{-1} is smooth.\n\n6. There exists a countable collection of U_α that covers M.\n\n7. For any distinct points p, q in M, either there exists α in J such that p, q are in U_α, or there exist α, β in J with p in U_α, q in U_β, and U_α ∩ U_β = ∅.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that M has a unique manifold structure such that each (U_α, φ_α) is a smooth chart.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user is specifically confused about the uniqueness part. The existence is already proved. So perhaps the problem is about proving uniqueness, given those assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: each listed as above.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is a unique smooth manifold structure on M such that each pair (U_α, φ_α) is a smooth chart.\n\nBut the original lemma says \"has a unique manifold structure such that each pair...\", so the problem is to prove the uniqueness part of this lemma.\n\nHence, structuring the problem accordingly.",
