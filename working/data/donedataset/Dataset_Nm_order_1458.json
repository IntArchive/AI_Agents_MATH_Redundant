    "Content": "The formulation I'm looking at goes: If $\\lbrace x_n\\rbrace$, $\\lbrace y_n\\rbrace$ and $\\lbrace z_n \\rbrace$ are sequences such that $x_n \\le y_n \\le z_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb N$, and $x_n \\to l$ and $z_n \\to l$ for some $l \\in \\mathbb R$, then $y_n \\to l$ also.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving the Squeeze Theorem for sequences. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. So first, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that we have three sequences: {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n}. The conditions given are that x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n for all n in natural numbers. Also, both x_n and z_n converge to the same limit l. The goal is to prove that y_n also converges to l.\n\nNow, breaking down the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The first sequence is {x_n}, and the condition is that for all n in N, x_n ≤ y_n. Wait, but the original condition is x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n. So maybe split this into two parts: x_n ≤ y_n for all n, and y_n ≤ z_n for all n. However, the user's example had each assumption on a separate line, even if they apply to different objects. Wait, in the example, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Both apply to n. Here, we have multiple conditions on different sequences.\n\nBut the problem mentions three sequences. Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote:\n\n\"If {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n} are sequences such that x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n for all n in N, and x_n → l and z_n → l for some l in R, then y_n → l also.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} are sequences.\n- For all n in N, x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n.\n- x_n converges to l.\n- z_n converges to l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\n- {x_n} is a sequence.\n- {y_n} is a sequence.\n- {z_n} is a sequence.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, y_n ≤ z_n.\n- The limit of {x_n} as n approaches infinity is l.\n- The limit of {z_n} as n approaches infinity is l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But here, the problem mentions sequences and their properties. Let's see how the example was structured. The example had the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. So perhaps in this case:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} are sequences.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n.\n- The sequence {x_n} converges to l.\n- The sequence {z_n} converges to l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nBut the user's example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, maybe split the convergence into two separate assumptions for x_n and z_n. Also, the first line says \"are sequences\", which is a single assumption about all three. However, in the example, the user had each assumption on a separate line, even if they apply to different objects. Wait, in the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate lines, both applying to n. So here, maybe each individual condition, even if they apply to different objects, should be separate.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- {x_n} is a sequence.\n- {y_n} is a sequence.\n- {z_n} is a sequence.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, y_n ≤ z_n.\n- {x_n} converges to l.\n- {z_n} converges to l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nBut this seems too granular. The original problem statement groups the three sequences together, so perhaps:\n\n- {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n} are sequences.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n.\n- {x_n} converges to l ∈ ℝ.\n- {z_n} converges to l ∈ ℝ.\n\nBut the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are separate. So perhaps we need to split the convergence into two assumptions and the sequences into three. However, the user's example combined multiple conditions in the problem statement but split the assumptions. Wait, the example in the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so the assumption in the formatted problem was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption listed n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. Maybe that's an error in the example. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but we should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but we need to follow the format as per their instruction. So according to the example, each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property applied to one object. So even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists assumptions, which could include conditions that were in the original problem's hypothesis. Wait, no. In the example, the original problem's hypothesis was \"for every integer n\", which becomes an assumption that n is an integer, but the problem also requires that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect, but we have to proceed with the user's format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. But that's unclear. Maybe the user intended to include all the hypotheses as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's given conditions.\n\nIn the current problem about the Squeeze Theorem, the given conditions are:\n\n1. Three sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n}.\n2. For all n, x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n.\n3. x_n → l and z_n → l.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each of these conditions. Each condition as a separate line. But how to split them?\n\n- {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} are sequences.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, y_n ≤ z_n.\n- The limit of {x_n} is l.\n- The limit of {z_n} is l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nThat's six assumptions. Alternatively, combining the inequalities:\n\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"x_n ≤ y_n\" is one condition applied to x_n and y_n, and \"y_n ≤ z_n\" is another condition applied to y_n and z_n. Therefore, they should be separate.\n\nSimilarly, the convergence of x_n to l and z_n to l are separate assumptions. Also, l being a real number is another assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- {x_n} is a sequence.\n- {y_n} is a sequence.\n- {z_n} is a sequence.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, y_n ≤ z_n.\n- {x_n} converges to l.\n- {z_n} converges to l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nBut perhaps the first three can be combined into one assumption: {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n} are sequences. Because in the example, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\". So here, the problem states that {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} are sequences, so that can be a single assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n} are sequences.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n.\n- {x_n} converges to l.\n- {z_n} converges to l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"x_n → l and z_n → l for some l ∈ ℝ\". So l being real is part of the convergence statements. In mathematical terms, convergence to a real number implies that the limit is real. So maybe stating that {x_n} converges to l and {z_n} converges to l, and l is in ℝ. But in some contexts, sequences can converge to ±∞, but in this theorem, the limit must be a real number. Therefore, the assumption that l is real is important.\n\nThus, the assumptions:\n\n- {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n} are sequences.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n.\n- The sequence {x_n} converges to l ∈ ℝ.\n- The sequence {z_n} converges to l ∈ ℝ.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So if \"l ∈ ℝ\" is part of the convergence statement, then maybe split them:\n\n- {x_n} converges to l.\n- {z_n} converges to l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nBut in standard theorem statements, when we say a sequence converges to l, it's implied that l is a real number (unless specified otherwise). However, in the problem, the user mentioned \"l ∈ ℝ\", so it's explicit. Therefore, to be precise, we should include that l is real.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n} are sequences of real numbers.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n.\n- The sequence {x_n} converges to l ∈ ℝ.\n- The sequence {z_n} converges to l ∈ ℝ.\n\nAlternatively, if we take \"sequences of real numbers\" as part of the assumption, then:\n\n- {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n} are real sequences.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n ≤ z_n.\n- The limit of {x_n} as n approaches infinity is l.\n- The limit of {z_n} as n approaches infinity is l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nBut perhaps combining the convergence and the realness:\n\n- {x_n} converges to a real number l.\n- {z_n} converges to the same real number l.\n\nBut the example separates properties. So perhaps:\n\n- {x_n} is a sequence.\n- {y_n} is a sequence.\n- {z_n} is a sequence.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, y_n ≤ z_n.\n- {x_n} converges to l.\n- {z_n} converges to l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nThis seems very granular but aligns with the example where each assumption is a single line, one property per object. Even though the original problem groups them, the example suggests splitting them.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each assumption separately, even if they are related. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- {x_n} is a sequence.\n- {y_n} is a sequence.\n- {z_n} is a sequence.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n.\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, y_n ≤ z_n.\n- The limit of {x_n} is l.\n- The limit of {z_n} is l.\n- l is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that {y_n} converges to l.\n\nBut in the original problem, the conclusion is that y_n → l. So the problem statement is to prove that y_n converges to l given those assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove that the limit of y_n is l, which is the same as y_n converges to l.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n{x_n} is a sequence,\n{y_n} is a sequence,\n{z_n} is a sequence,\nFor all n ∈ ℕ, x_n ≤ y_n,\nFor all n ∈ ℕ, y_n ≤ z_n,\nThe sequence {x_n} converges to l,\nThe sequence {z_n} converges to l,\nl is a real number.\nProblem:\nProve that {y_n} converges to l.",
