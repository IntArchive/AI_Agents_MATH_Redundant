    "Content": "It is easy to show $\\log$ isn't a polynomial (no continuous extension to $\\mathbb{R}$). More challenging is showing it isn't rational. Suppose it were a rational function. Then write, the fraction in lowest terms $$\\log x =\\frac{G(x)}{Q(x)} \\Longleftrightarrow\\frac{G(x)}{\\log x} = Q(x)$$ Clearly, as $x \\to 0$, $Q(x) \\to 0$. However, $Q(x)$ then has $x$ as factor so that $$\\frac{G(x)}{x\\log x} = Q_2(x)$$ It is well known that $x \\log x \\to 0$ as $x \\to 0$, so for $Q_2(x)$ to have a finite limit as $x \\to 0$, which it must since it is a polynomial, $G(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to 0$ so that $x$ is a factor of $G(x)$. This contradicts the assumption that $\\frac{G}{Q}$ was in lowest terms. If there is something wrong with this, please comment, but my main question is What are some other ways to prove that $\\log x$ isn't a rational function?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One reason is that a rational function is defined over all $\\mathbb R$ except for a finite number of points, but $\\log$ is not. Let's prove that $\\log$ is not even a rational function restricted to $(0,+\\infty)$. If $\\log = \\dfrac GQ$, then $\\dfrac 1x = \\log' = \\dfrac{G'Q-GQ'}{Q^2}$. This implies that $G$ and $Q$ have the same degree and therefore $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\dfrac{G(x)}{Q(x)}$ is finite. But $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\log(x) = \\infty$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original question and the example provided.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that the logarithm function isn't a rational function. The user has provided an example where they listed assumptions and the problem statement. My task is to extract the assumptions and the problem from the given question, following the same structure.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were about the properties of the variables involved. In the current problem, the user starts by mentioning that it's easy to show log isn't a polynomial but more challenging to show it's not rational. They then outline a method assuming log is a rational function, leading to a contradiction about the lowest terms of the fraction. The main question is asking for other methods to prove this.\n\nSo, the key here is to filter out the assumptions made in the problem. The original problem's approach assumes log is a rational function, leading to specific conditions on G(x) and Q(x). The contradiction arises from G and Q sharing a common factor, which violates the lowest terms assumption. Therefore, the assumptions for this problem would include:\n\n1. log x is a rational function.\n2. The rational function is expressed as G(x)/Q(x) in lowest terms.\n3. The behavior as x approaches 0 (Q(x) tends to 0, implying x is a factor).\n4. The implication that G(x) must also have x as a factor, leading to contradiction.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the original problem again.\n\nThe problem states: Suppose log x were a rational function. Then write it as G(x)/Q(x) in lowest terms. Then as x→0, Q(x)→0, so x is a factor of Q(x). Then G(x)/(x log x) = Q2(x). Since x log x→0, G(x) must also →0, implying x is a factor of G(x), contradicting the lowest terms.\n\nSo the assumptions made in the problem are:\n\n- log x is a rational function (i.e., can be written as G(x)/Q(x) where G and Q are polynomials).\n- G(x)/Q(x) is in lowest terms (no common factors).\n- The behavior as x approaches 0 implies Q(x) has x as a factor.\n- Similarly, G(x) must have x as a factor, contradicting the lowest terms.\n\nBut for the structured format, we need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\nAssumption 1: log x is a rational function. (This is the main assumption for contradiction.)\nAssumption 2: The rational function is written as G(x)/Q(x) where G and Q are polynomials with no common factors. (Lowest terms.)\nAssumption 3: As x approaches 0, Q(x) approaches 0. (Because log x approaches -infinity, but the fraction must be defined? Wait, maybe need to think again.)\n\nWait, the user's argument is that if log x = G(x)/Q(x), then rearranged gives Q(x) = G(x)/log x. As x approaches 0, log x approaches -infinity, so Q(x) approaches 0 because G(x) would be finite if x approaches 0 (assuming G is a polynomial, which is finite everywhere). Therefore, Q(x) must tend to 0, implying x is a factor of Q(x).\n\nBut polynomials are continuous, so if Q(x) tends to 0 as x→0, then Q(0)=0, hence x divides Q(x). Therefore, Q(x) = x Q2(x). Then substituting back, we get G(x)/log x = x Q2(x), so G(x) = x log x Q2(x). As x→0, x log x →0, so G(x) must →0, implying x divides G(x), which contradicts the lowest terms.\n\nThus, the assumptions in the problem's argument are:\n\n1. log x is a rational function (i.e., expressible as a ratio of two polynomials).\n2. The expression G(x)/Q(x) is in lowest terms (no common polynomial factors).\n3. Q(x) tends to 0 as x approaches 0.\n4. Therefore, x is a factor of Q(x).\n5. Then G(x) must also tend to 0 as x approaches 0 (since Q2(x) is a polynomial and x log x tends to 0).\n6. Hence, x is a factor of G(x), contradicting the lowest terms.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were more about the conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are steps in the argument. However, the user wants the problem structured by listing assumptions and the problem statement. The example included assumptions that were given conditions. In this case, the original problem presents a method with its own assumptions leading to a contradiction, but the main question is asking for other methods. So, perhaps the problem as posed is \"What are some other ways to prove that log x isn't a rational function?\" with the assumptions being that log x is a rational function, etc.\n\nWait, the user's main question is: \"What are some other ways to prove that log x isn't a rational function?\" So the problem is to find alternative proofs. But the original problem's own approach is one method, and the user is asking for others. The structured problem should capture the main question, and the assumptions would be the conditions necessary for that problem. However, the example given in the problem had specific mathematical conditions (n is integer, divisible by 7). Here, perhaps the assumptions are more about the properties of log x and rational functions.\n\nBut how to structure this? The problem is to show log isn't a rational function. The original method makes certain assumptions (log is rational, expressed as G/Q in lowest terms, etc.), leading to contradiction. But the main question is asking for other methods, so the problem is \"Prove that log x is not a rational function,\" and the assumptions would be the properties used in the problem's context.\n\nWait, the example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" with assumptions that n is integer and divisible by 7. In the current case, the problem is \"Prove that log x is not a rational function,\" and the assumptions would be...? The original problem's own approach has assumptions (like log is rational, leading to contradiction), but the main question is the general one: show log isn't rational. So perhaps the problem is simply \"Prove that log x is not a rational function,\" and the assumptions would be the basic properties of log and rational functions.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the definitions. For example, a rational function is a ratio of two polynomials. The logarithm function is defined for x > 0, etc. But the example given in the user's prompt included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" which are specific conditions. \n\nIn the current problem, the main mathematical statement to prove is \"log x is not a rational function,\" so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials.\n- The logarithm function is defined for x > 0.\n- Polynomials are defined for all real numbers (but log isn't, but that's more for showing it's not a polynomial).\n- The problem may assume we're working over the real numbers.\n\nBut the example didn't list all those; it listed specific conditions on the variable. Maybe in this case, since the problem is more general, there are no specific numerical assumptions, but rather definitions. However, according to the example, the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, for the problem \"Prove that log x is not a rational function,\" the assumptions would be:\n\n- A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials.\n- The logarithm function is defined for x > 0.\n- Polynomials are entire functions (defined for all real numbers except possibly finite points for rational functions, but rational functions are ratios of polynomials, which are defined everywhere except where the denominator is zero).\n\nWait, but maybe in the context of the problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. log x is a real-valued function defined for x > 0.\n2. A rational function is a quotient of two polynomials G(x) and Q(x), where Q(x) is not the zero polynomial.\n3. The rational function G(x)/Q(x) is in lowest terms (no common factors).\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a representation is impossible. However, in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, perhaps the assumptions are more about the properties of the functions involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as posed in the original question is asking for other methods beyond the one outlined, so the problem statement is \"What are some other ways to prove that log x is not a rational function?\" But according to the example, the problem should be structured as \"Prove that...\" So perhaps the problem is \"Prove that log x is not a rational function,\" and the assumptions would be the necessary definitions.\n\nBut the example had specific numerical conditions. Since the user's example extracted assumptions from the problem statement, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are those made in the attempted proof, which lead to the contradiction. However, the main question is asking for other methods, so the problem is \"Prove that log x is not a rational function,\" with the assumptions being the properties used in the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions here are the conditions under which the problem is posed. For instance, working in the real numbers, log is defined for x > 0, rational functions are ratios of polynomials, etc. But the example didn't include such general assumptions, rather specific ones related to the variable.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me look again at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\"\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, or perhaps it's intentional. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, but the example is structured as such. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, but the formatted problem corrected it by adding the divisibility by 7.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is a different problem. Let me check the example again:\n\nExample:\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a mistake and the correct assumption is that n is divisible by 7. However, since this is an example provided by the user, we have to follow their structure even if there's a mistake.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So the user is showing that they can add assumptions beyond what's in the original problem, perhaps to correct or specify.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original question is asking for other methods to prove log isn't rational. The problem as posed is \"What are some other ways to prove that log x isn't a rational function?\" But according to the format, the problem should be stated as \"Prove that...\" So perhaps we need to rephrase the question into a problem statement.\n\nThe user's main question is asking for alternative proofs, but the format requires a problem statement like \"Prove that log x is not a rational function.\" Then the assumptions would be the conditions under which this proof is to be shown. Since the original problem outlines a method using behavior as x approaches 0, another method might use different properties, like growth rates, poles, etc.\n\nHowever, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, which includes listing assumptions and the problem. In the example, assumptions were specific conditions on n. Here, perhaps the assumptions are the properties of log and rational functions necessary for the proof.\n\nBut since the original problem is a general proof, maybe there are no specific numeric assumptions, but rather definitions. However, the example included specific numeric conditions. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- log x is a real-valued function defined for x > 0.\n- A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials.\n- Polynomials are defined for all real numbers except possibly at the zeros of the denominator.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were more about the variables in the problem. Maybe in this case, since the problem is more about function properties, the assumptions are:\n\n- log x is a rational function. (This is the assumption for contradiction.)\n- A rational function can be expressed as G(x)/Q(x) where G and Q are polynomials with no common factors.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were about the problem's variables, not the proof's assumptions. The original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to highlight specific conditions. So maybe in the current problem, the assumptions are those used in the proof attempt described in the question, which are:\n\n1. log x is a rational function.\n2. The rational function is written in lowest terms as G(x)/Q(x).\n3. As x approaches 0, Q(x) approaches 0.\n4. x is a factor of Q(x).\n5. x log x approaches 0 as x approaches 0.\n6. G(x) must also approach 0 as x approaches 0, implying x is a factor of G(x).\n\nBut these are steps in the proof leading to contradiction. However, according to the example, assumptions should be listed as separate conditions. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the assumptions for the problem (as posed in the original question's own method) are:\n\n- log x is a rational function (expressed as G(x)/Q(x) in lowest terms).\n- The behavior as x approaches 0 implies Q(x) has x as a factor.\n- Similarly, G(x) must then have x as a factor, contradicting lowest terms.\n\nBut the problem is to find other methods, so the formatted problem would be \"Prove that log x is not a rational function,\" with assumptions being the definitions and conditions necessary.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's main question is asking for other methods, maybe the problem is \"Provide alternative proofs that log x is not a rational function,\" with assumptions being that log is a function defined for x > 0, and rational functions are ratios of polynomials.\n\nBut given the example, which took the original problem and reformatted it by possibly adding assumptions, perhaps the correct approach here is to extract the key assumptions from the original problem's context. The original problem mentions that log x isn't a polynomial and then supposes it's a rational function in lowest terms. The key assumptions in their argument are:\n\n1. log x is a rational function.\n2. This rational function is expressed as G(x)/Q(x) in lowest terms (no common factors).\n3. The behavior as x approaches 0 (Q(x) tends to 0, implying x divides Q(x)).\n4. The subsequent implication that G(x) must also have x as a factor, contradicting the lowest terms.\n\nBut these are steps in their proof, not assumptions of the problem. The actual assumptions for the problem \"Prove log x isn't a rational function\" would be the definitions:\n\n- A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials.\n- log x is defined for x > 0.\n- Polynomials are defined everywhere except at the denominator's zeros.\n\nHowever, the example provided by the user included specific numerical conditions on the variable, not definitions. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to list the assumptions that are necessary for the problem, which in this case are:\n\n- log x is a function from positive real numbers to real numbers.\n- A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials.\n- A rational function's domain is all real numbers except the zeros of the denominator.\n\nBut the example didn't include such general assumptions. The example's assumptions were specific to the variable. So maybe in this case, since there are no variables with conditions, the problem is just to prove log isn't rational, with the only assumption being that we are considering real-valued functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no specific assumptions beyond the definitions, and the formatted problem would have an empty assumptions section. But the example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to follow the structure of the example, which took the original problem's conditions and listed them as assumptions. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. This suggests that the user may have intended to highlight specific conditions even if they are part of the problem's universal quantifier.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's own approach assumes log is a rational function expressed in lowest terms, leading to a contradiction. The main question is asking for other methods. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nlog x is a rational function,\nThe rational function is expressed as G(x)/Q(x) in lowest terms,\nQ(x) approaches 0 as x approaches 0,\nx is a factor of Q(x),\nG(x) approaches 0 as x approaches 0,\nx is a factor of G(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that log x is not a rational function.\n\nBut this seems too detailed, and the example only had two assumptions. The original example's problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with assumptions n is integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n1. log x is a rational function (for contradiction).\n2. The rational function is in lowest terms G(x)/Q(x).\n3. Q(x) has x as a factor.\n4. G(x) must also have x as a factor.\n\nBut the problem is to prove log x isn't rational, so perhaps the assumptions are those that lead to the contradiction. However, in the example, the assumptions were conditions on n, not steps in the proof. Hence, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternative approach: The original problem is asking for other methods to prove log isn't rational. The formatted problem should capture this as the problem statement, and the assumptions are the conditions necessary. However, the example transformed the original problem into a more specific one (adding n divisible by 7), but perhaps in this case, we just need to restate the problem as \"Prove that log x is not a rational function,\" with assumptions being the basic properties.\n\nBut the example included assumptions that were not all present in the original problem's statement. The original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7.\" This suggests that the user may have intended to correct or specify the problem's conditions.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem's own method uses the behavior as x approaches 0. Other methods might use different approaches, like behavior at infinity, differentiability, or poles. The problem is to provide such alternative proofs.\n\nGiven the example, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nlog x is a rational function,\nThe rational function is expressed as a ratio of two polynomials in lowest terms.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log x is not a rational function.\n\nBut the original example included more specific assumptions. Alternatively, since the user's own method uses the behavior at x approaching 0, another method might use behavior at infinity. Therefore, the assumptions could include properties related to that, but it's unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to follow the example's structure, which listed the key conditions from the problem. In the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. This suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but we have to follow it as is.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the key assumptions from the original problem's context are:\n\n1. log x is a rational function.\n2. The rational function is written as G(x)/Q(x) in lowest terms.\n3. As x approaches 0, Q(x) approaches 0.\n4. Therefore, x is a factor of Q(x).\n5. x log x approaches 0 as x approaches 0.\n6. Hence, G(x) must approach 0, implying x is a factor of G(x).\n\nBut listing all these as assumptions would be too detailed. The example had two assumptions. Perhaps the main assumptions are:\n\n- log x is a rational function.\n- The rational function is in lowest terms G(x)/Q(x).\n\nAnd the problem is to derive a contradiction from these assumptions, thereby proving log x isn't rational. But the original question is asking for other methods, so the problem statement should be \"Prove that log x is not a rational function using methods different from the one outlined.\"\n\nHowever, the example's problem statement was a direct imperative (\"Prove that...\"), so perhaps the formatted problem here is \"Prove that log x is not a rational function,\" with assumptions being the key conditions used in the problem's context.\n\nGiven the confusion and following the example's lead, I'll proceed to structure the problem as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nlog x is a rational function,\nThe rational function is expressed as G(x)/Q(x) in lowest terms,\nQ(x) approaches 0 as x approaches 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log x is not a rational function.\n\nBut this might not be accurate, as the assumptions are part of the proof method, not the problem's conditions. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove log isn't rational, the assumptions are the properties that define a rational function and log x.\n\nBut given the example's approach, I think the user expects the assumptions to be the key conditions used in the problem. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA rational function is a ratio of two polynomials,\nlog x is defined for x > 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log x is not a rational function.\n\nHowever, the example included specific numerical conditions, so maybe this is not the case. Alternatively, given that the original problem's own method leads to a contradiction by assuming log is a rational function in lowest terms, the formatted problem's assumptions would be those made in that method.\n\nBut the user's main question is asking for other methods, so the problem is to prove log isn't rational, and the assumptions are the general conditions necessary, like:\n\n- A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials.\n- log x is a transcendental function.\n\nBut transcendental is a conclusion, not an assumption.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following structured problem based on the original question's context:\n\nAssumption:\nlog x can be expressed as a rational function G(x)/Q(x),\nG(x) and Q(x) are polynomials with no common factors,\nThe behavior of log x as x approaches 0 is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that log x is not a rational function.\n\nBut to align with the example's style, which listed assumptions about the variable, here the assumptions might be:\n\n- log x is a rational function.\n- The rational function is in lowest terms.\n\nThen the problem is to show a contradiction, thereby proving log x isn't rational.\n\nHowever, the example's assumptions were about the variable n. Since this problem is about functions, the assumptions are about the function's properties. Therefore, I'll format it as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nlog x is a rational function,\nThe rational function is expressed as G(x)/Q(x) in lowest terms.\nProblem:\nProve that log x is not a rational function.",
