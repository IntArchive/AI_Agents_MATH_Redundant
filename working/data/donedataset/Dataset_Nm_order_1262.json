    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove or disprove that there are infinitely many primes of the form ⌊√3 * n⌋. Hmm, primes in arithmetic progressions or special sequences are tricky. Let me recall Dirichlet's theorem, which says there are infinitely many primes in an arithmetic progression a + nd, if a and d are coprime. But this isn't exactly an arithmetic progression because the sequence here is ⌊√3 * n⌋, which is a Beatty sequence maybe?\n\nWait, Beatty sequences are sequences of the form ⌊αn⌋ where α is irrational. And there's a theorem that says if α and β are irrationals such that 1/α + 1/β = 1, then the Beatty sequences α and β partition the natural numbers. But I don't know if that's directly useful here. The question is about primes in such a sequence.\n\nFirst, let me parse the original problem. The user tried to expand ⌊√3 * n⌋ using a theorem about floor functions. They split into cases based on the fractional part of √3. Wait, the theorem they cited is for ⌊nx⌋, which they applied here with x = √3. But they substituted the fractional part {x} as √3 -1, since √3 ≈1.732..., so the integer part is 1, hence fractional part is √3 -1 ≈0.732... So in their case, they consider the fractional part {√3} = √3 -1. Then, they wrote ⌊√3 *n⌋ as different cases depending on where {√3} falls in the intervals [k/n, (k+1)/n). But since {√3} is a fixed irrational number (~0.732), for each n, they check which interval {√3} is in. However, since {√3} is fixed, as n increases, the interval [k/n, (k+1)/n) shifts. Wait, maybe the user is trying to express ⌊√3 *n⌋ as n multiplied by the integer part of √3 (which is 1) plus some k, depending on how the fractional part interacts with k/n. But their expansion seems a bit off. Let me check:\n\nThe theorem they mention is for ⌊n x⌋ where x is a real number. If x is written as floor(x) + {x}, then n x = n floor(x) + n {x}. So, ⌊n x⌋ = n floor(x) + ⌊n {x}⌋. Then, depending on the value of {x}, which is the fractional part, the floor of n times {x} can be broken into cases. For example, if {x} is between 0 and 1/n, then ⌊n{x}⌋ =0, so ⌊n x⌋=n floor(x). If {x} is between 1/n and 2/n, then ⌊n{x}⌋=1, so ⌊n x⌋=n floor(x)+1, etc. So in this case, since x=√3≈1.732, floor(x)=1, {x}=√3-1≈0.732. Then, for each n, {x}=√3-1≈0.732. Then n{ x }≈0.732n. Then ⌊n{ x }⌋= floor(0.732n). So the expression becomes ⌊√3 n⌋=n*1 + floor(0.732n). So the user's cases are based on where 0.732n falls. For example, if 0.732n is between k and k+1, then floor(0.732n)=k. So the value is n +k. But the user wrote intervals for {x}=√3 -1 compared to k/n. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe user's theorem states that ⌊n x⌋ is equal to different cases based on the fractional part of x. But in their expansion, they set x=√3, so {x}=√3 -1. Then, they split into cases based on where {x} is in [k/n, (k+1)/n). But {x}=√3 -1≈0.732 is fixed. So for each n, they check which interval [k/n, (k+1)/n) contains 0.732. For example, for n=1, [0,1) which it does. For n=2, [0, 0.5), [0.5,1). 0.732 is in [0.5,1), so k=1. Then ⌊√3 *2⌋=2*1 +1=3. But √3*2≈3.464, so floor is 3, correct. For n=3, the intervals are [0,1/3), [1/3,2/3), [2/3,1). 0.732 is in [2/3,1), so k=2. Then ⌊√3*3⌋=3*1 +2=5. √3*3≈5.196, floor is 5. Correct. So the user's expansion is correct. So for each n, depending on which interval {√3} falls into, k is determined, so that ⌊√3 n⌋=n +k. Then k is floor(n{√3})=floor(0.732n). Hence, the sequence is n + floor(0.732n). But how does this help in proving infinitude of primes in this sequence?\n\nWait, the user is asking how to proceed from their analysis. So they've expressed ⌊√3 n⌋ as n + k, where k is floor(n*(√3 -1)). Since √3 -1 is irrational (because √3 is irrational), the sequence ⌊√3 n⌋ is a Beatty sequence with irrational α=√3. Beatty sequences are known to have infinitely many primes if certain conditions hold. However, the question of whether a general Beatty sequence contains infinitely many primes is still open, I think. Unless there's a specific density or other property that can be used.\n\nWait, there is a theorem by Vinogradov in 1947 which states that if α is irrational and satisfies some approximation condition, then the Beatty sequence ⌊α n⌋ contains infinitely many primes. But I don't recall the exact conditions. Alternatively, more recent work by Banks and Shparlinski (2006) showed that under the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures, Beatty sequences contain primes infinitely often. But I'm not sure if that's unconditional.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for specific α like √3, one can use some properties. Since √3 is a quadratic irrational, maybe there's a way to relate the sequence to some arithmetic progression or to use diophantine approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence ⌊√3 n⌋ can be shown to include infinitely many numbers of a certain form, which are known to have primes infinitely often. For example, if the Beatty sequence contains an arithmetic progression, then Dirichlet's theorem applies. But since √3 is irrational, the sequence ⌊√3 n⌋ is not an arithmetic progression. However, maybe it contains infinitely many terms from an arithmetic progression.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the differences between consecutive terms of the sequence ⌊√3 n⌋ are either ⌊√3(n+1)⌋ - ⌊√3 n⌋ which is either ⌊√3(n+1) - √3 n⌋ or ⌊√3(n+1) - √3 n⌋ +1. Since √3(n+1) - √3 n = √3, which is approximately 1.732. So the difference between consecutive terms is either 1 or 2. Specifically, the difference alternates between 1 and 2. For example, n=1: floor(1.732)=1; n=2: floor(3.464)=3 (difference 2); n=3: floor(5.196)=5 (difference 2); n=4: floor(6.928)=6 (difference 1); n=5: floor(8.660)=8 (difference 2); etc. So the differences are irregular but often 1 or 2.\n\nBut how does that help? The primes are scattered, and even though the gaps between terms of the sequence are small, it's unclear if they can cover primes infinitely often.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the sequence has positive density. Since √3 is about 1.732, the terms are roughly n*1.732, so the density is about 1/√3 ≈0.577. So the density is higher than the primes, which have density 0. So maybe one can use some form of the prime number theorem for Beatty sequences? I recall that there is a version where under certain conditions, the number of primes in a Beatty sequence (⌊α n + β⌋) is asymptotic to (1/α) * (1/log N), similar to the prime number theorem. But this would require α to be irrational and maybe satisfy some diophantine condition. If that's the case, then as N tends to infinity, the number of primes in the sequence up to N would tend to infinity, implying infinitely many primes. However, I think such results are conditional or require specific conditions on α.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that √3 is badly approximable? Since it's a quadratic irrational, its continued fraction is periodic, so it's badly approximable, which might help in applying some analytic number theory methods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a way to map this sequence to another set where primes are known to be infinite. But I can't think of a direct mapping.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is posed by the user and they mention a theorem about floor functions, maybe they are expecting an elementary approach. But I don't see an obvious elementary method here. The user split the expression into cases, but how does that help in proving infinitude of primes? Even if we know the form of ⌊√3 n⌋ for each n, unless we can relate it to a polynomial or arithmetic progression, it's unclear.\n\nWait, the user's expansion shows that for each n, ⌊√3 n⌋ can take values from n up to 2n-1, depending on the fractional part. So the sequence includes numbers from n to 2n-1, but as n increases, these ranges overlap. For example, when n=1, the term is 1; n=2, 3; n=3, 5; n=4, 6; n=5,8; n=6,10; etc. The terms grow approximately linearly. But how do we know primes are infinite here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the sequence contains all sufficiently large numbers from some point. But since √3 is irrational, the sequence ⌊√3 n⌋ will not cover all integers, but it's dense in the natural numbers with density 1/√3. So the sequence has positive density, and primes have density 0, but primes are infinite. However, positive density doesn't necessarily imply the subset contains infinitely many primes. For example, the even numbers have density 1/2 but contain only one prime. But in this case, the sequence is not avoiding primes; it's just a question of whether the primes in the sequence are infinite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the primes of the form ⌊n^θ⌋ for some θ>1. There's a result by Iwaniec which states that for θ < 12/11, there are infinitely many primes in the sequence ⌊n^θ⌋. But θ here is 1, since √3 n is linear, so θ=1. Hmm, not sure if that applies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Green-Tao theorem, but that requires the sequence to contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, which ⌊√3 n⌋ might not have.\n\nAlternatively, think about the distribution modulo small primes. If the sequence ⌊√3 n⌋ can be shown to hit every residue class modulo some prime, but I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for large n, ⌊√3 n⌋ is approximately √3 n, and by the prime number theorem, the number of primes less than X is ~X/log X. So the number of terms in the sequence up to X is roughly X/√3, and if the primes in the sequence are roughly (X/√3)/log X, which tends to infinity. But this is heuristic and not a proof. Because primes could be distributed unevenly in the sequence.\n\nHowever, to prove it rigorously, we would need a result akin to Dirichlet's theorem but for Beatty sequences. I think such a result is not known in general, but for specific cases. If √3 is such that the Beatty sequence satisfies some equidistribution or linear bias, maybe it's possible. But I don't recall a specific theorem for √3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence ⌊√3 n⌋ contains infinitely many primes because it is equidistributed modulo any integer, and thus hits every residue class, including those that are coprime to certain moduli. But even so, that doesn't directly imply infinitely many primes.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be open. The user mentions it's a problem they made themselves, so it's possible that it's an open question. But maybe there is a known result.\n\nWait, I found a paper by Banks and Shparlinski titled \"Prime Numbers in Beatty Sequences\" which states that under the GRH (Generalized Riemann Hypothesis), the Beatty sequence ⌊α n + β⌋ contains infinitely many primes provided that α is irrational and satisfies some diophantine condition. Since √3 is a quadratic irrational, it's diophantine (i.e., badly approximable), so under GRH, there are infinitely many primes. But unconditionally, it might still be open.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that it's not known unconditionally, but under GRH it's true. Or if the user is expecting an elementary disproof, but I don't see a way to disprove it either. Since the sequence has positive density and primes are infinite, it's plausible that there are infinitely many primes in the sequence, but proving it is another matter.\n\nBut the user is asking how to proceed from their analysis. They split ⌊√3 n⌋ into cases based on the fractional part. Maybe they want to show that in each case, the expression can take prime values infinitely often. But since the cases depend on n, and for each n, the value is n + k, where k≈0.732n, the term is approximately 1.732n. So the primes in question are roughly of size 1.732n. But how does varying n and k help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that for some n, ⌊√3 n⌋=m, and m must be prime. For each prime m, can we find an n such that m=⌊√3 n⌋? If we can show that infinitely many primes m satisfy m/√3 ≤n <(m+1)/√3 for some integer n, then there are infinitely many primes in the sequence. But this is equivalent to saying that for infinitely many primes m, the interval [m/√3, (m+1)/√3) contains an integer n. Which would mean that the length of the interval must be at least 1 sometimes. The length of the interval is (m+1)/√3 - m/√3 =1/√3≈0.577. Since this is less than 1, it's not guaranteed that every interval contains an integer. However, by the Dirichlet approximation theorem, for infinitely many m, the fractional part of m/√3 is less than ε for any ε>0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem reduces to showing that there are infinitely many primes m such that m ≡k mod d for some k and d, but I don't see the connection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a sieve method. Show that the set S = {⌊√3 n⌋ | n∈N} has positive density and satisfies sieve axioms, so that the number of primes in S up to X tends to infinity. But sieve methods usually give lower bounds, and proving there are infinitely many requires more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence ⌊√3 n⌋ contains all primes congruent to certain residues modulo some number. For example, if √3 is a primitive root modulo some number, but I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, think of n as approximately m/√3. So for primes m≈√3 n, can we show that there are infinitely many primes m such that m is close to √3 n for some integer n. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the Beatty sequence ⌊√3 n⌋ is the same as the set of numbers m where m/√3 ≤n < (m+1)/√3. So for each prime m, check if there exists an integer n in that interval. The interval has length ~1/√3≈0.577. So for primes m, the interval [m/√3, (m+1)/√3) might or might not contain an integer n. If we can show that for infinitely many primes m, this interval contains an integer n, then those primes m are in the sequence. So the problem reduces to showing that there are infinitely many primes m where m/√3 has fractional part less than 1/√3≈0.577. That is, m=⌊√3 n⌋ implies that n is in [m/√3, (m+1)/√3). So n must be an integer in that interval. The interval has length ~0.577, so for each m, there is about a 0.577 chance (if uniform) that there's an integer n there. But primes are not random. However, if the fractional parts of m/√3 are distributed uniformly, then for a density ~0.577 of primes m, there would be an integer n. If primes are equidistributed modulo 1 with respect to √3, then there would be infinitely many such m. But proving equidistribution is non-trivial.\n\nThere's a theorem by Vinogradov which states that the fractional parts of α p are equidistributed modulo 1 for irrational α, where p runs over primes. If α is irrational, then the sequence α p mod 1 is equidistributed. So if we take α=1/√3, then the fractional parts of p/√3 would be equidistributed. Therefore, the fractional part {p/√3} is equidistributed in [0,1). Therefore, the measure of m where {p/√3} ∈ [0,1/√3) is 1/√3≈0.577. So there should be infinitely many primes p where {p/√3} ∈ [0,1/√3), which implies that there exists an integer n such that p=⌊√3 n⌋. Therefore, under equidistribution, there should be infinitely many primes in the sequence. But does this theorem exist?\n\nYes, Vinogradov's theorem on equidistribution of primes in irrational rotations. More precisely, if α is irrational, then the sequence {α p} is equidistributed modulo 1, where p runs over primes. This is a result from analytic number theory. Therefore, using this, we can say that the fractional parts {p/√3} are equidistributed, hence the proportion of primes p with {p/√3} ∈ [0,1/√3) is 1/√3, which is positive. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes in the sequence ⌊√3 n⌋.\n\nHowever, I need to check if this theorem is indeed applicable here. The equidistribution of {α p} for irrational α is a non-trivial result. It is related to the work of Vinogradov and Davenport. For example, in \"Multiplicative Number Theory\" by Davenport, there is a chapter on the distribution of primes modulo 1. The key idea is that if α is irrational, then the exponential sums over primes, sum_{p ≤x} e^{2π i α p}, decay as x tends to infinity, which implies equidistribution.\n\nAssuming this result holds, then the fractional parts {p/√3} are equidistributed, so there are infinitely many primes p where {p/√3} ∈ [0,1/√3). For each such prime p, there exists an integer n such that n = ⌊p/√3⌋, since p/√3 is in [n, n+1/√3), which implies that p ≥√3 n and p <√3(n+1/√3)=√3 n +1. Therefore, ⌊√3 n⌋=floor(√3 n) ≤p <floor(√3 n)+1. Wait, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Suppose p is a prime such that {p/√3} ∈ [0,1/√3). Then p/√3 = k + δ, where k is integer and 0 ≤δ <1/√3. Then p=√3(k + δ)=√3 k + √3 δ. Therefore, ⌊√3 k⌋=floor(√3 k). But p=√3 k +√3 δ. Since √3 δ <√3*(1/√3)=1, so p=√3 k + something less than 1. Therefore, floor(√3 k)=floor(p -√3 δ)=p -1, since p is integer and p -1 <√3 k <p. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if p=⌊√3 n⌋, then n=⌊p/√3⌋. So for a prime p, if there exists an integer n such that p=⌊√3 n⌋, then n=⌊p/√3⌋. So for such primes p, we have that √3 n ≤p <√3(n+1). Therefore, n ≤p/√3 <n+1, so p/√3 is in [n, n+1), and hence {p/√3}=p/√3 -n. So {p/√3}=p/√3 -floor(p/√3). But if p=⌊√3 n⌋, then n=floor(p/√3). Wait, this seems circular.\n\nWait, let's take a prime p and see under what conditions it can be written as p=⌊√3 n⌋ for some integer n. This requires that √3 n ≤p <√3(n+1). Solving for n: n ≤p/√3 <n+1 ⇒ n=⌊p/√3⌋. So for each prime p, check if p=⌊√3 n⌋ where n=⌊p/√3⌋. Which is equivalent to checking that p is the floor of √3 times the floor of p/√3. That is, p=⌊√3 * ⌊p/√3⌋⌋. This holds if and only if √3 * ⌊p/√3⌋ ≤p <√3(⌊p/√3⌋ +1). Which is always true, by the definition of floor function. Wait, that can't be. For example, take p=2. Then floor(2/√3)=1, √3*1≈1.732≤2<√3*2≈3.464, so yes. But ⌊√3*1⌋=1≠2. So no, it's not equivalent.\n\nSo my mistake here. Let me correct. For a prime p, if there exists an integer n such that p=⌊√3 n⌋, then n must satisfy √3 n ≤p <√3(n+1). Therefore, n ≤p/√3 <n+1 ⇒ n=⌊p/√3⌋. So the condition is that p=⌊√3 * ⌊p/√3⌋⌋. For example, take p=3. Then floor(3/√3)=floor(√3)=1. Then ⌊√3*1⌋=1≠3. So p=3 cannot be written as ⌊√3 n⌋. Similarly, p=5. floor(5/√3)=floor(2.886)=2. Then ⌊√3*2⌋=3≠5. Wait, no. Wait, floor(√3*2)=floor(3.464)=3. So 3≠5. So p=5 is not in the sequence. But earlier terms like p=5 is in the sequence when n=3: floor(√3*3)=floor(5.196)=5. So p=5 is in the sequence. So for p=5, n=3. Then floor(5/√3)=floor(2.886)=2. So p=5=⌊√3*3⌋, but floor(5/√3)=2. So there's a discrepancy. So the earlier logic is flawed.\n\nWait, no. If p=5=⌊√3*3⌋, then according to the inequality, n must satisfy √3*3 ≤5 <√3*4. Let's check: √3*3≈5.196, so 5.196 ≤5 <6.928? No, 5.196 ≤5 is false. So this suggests that my previous approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's clarify with actual calculation. If p=5=⌊√3*3⌋, then √3*3≈5.196, so floor is 5. So p=5. Then according to the inequality, we have √3*3 ≤5 <√3*4. But √3*3≈5.196>5, which is not true. Therefore, the inequality is not satisfied. So my previous reasoning was flawed.\n\nThis indicates that the equivalence I tried to set up is incorrect. So, the correct way is: If p=⌊√3 n⌋, then n must satisfy p ≤√3 n <p+1. Therefore, n ≥p/√3, and n <(p+1)/√3. Since n must be an integer, the interval [p/√3, (p+1)/√3) must contain at least one integer. So for a given prime p, there exists an integer n such that p=⌊√3 n⌋ if and only if there exists an integer n in [p/√3, (p+1)/√3). The length of this interval is (p+1)/√3 - p/√3 =1/√3≈0.577. Therefore, for each prime p, there is a chance of ~0.577 that there exists an integer n in this interval, i.e., that p=⌊√3 n⌋ for some n. However, this is only a heuristic.\n\nTo rigorously show that there are infinitely many primes p for which [p/√3, (p+1)/√3) contains an integer, we need to show that there are infinitely many primes p such that there exists an integer n with n ∈ [p/√3, (p+1)/√3). This is equivalent to saying that p ∈ [√3(n-1), √3 n) for some n. Wait, no. Because n ∈ [p/√3, (p+1)/√3) ⇒ p ∈ [√3 n -√3, √3 n). Wait, this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for a given integer n, the numbers ⌊√3 n⌋ are in the interval [√3 n -1, √3 n). So primes of the form ⌊√3 n⌋ must lie in [√3 n -1, √3 n). The question is whether there are infinitely many n such that this interval contains a prime. The interval has length ~1, and the average gap between primes near √3 n is O(log(√3 n)) by the prime number theorem. So the probability that a random interval of length 1 contains a prime is roughly 1/log(√3 n). Summing over n, this diverges (since ∑1/log n diverges), so by the probabilistic heuristic, one expects infinitely many primes in such intervals. But this is not a proof.\n\nHowever, using the theorem that the fractional parts {p/√3} are equidistributed for primes p, as per Vinogradov's result, we can say that the proportion of primes p where {p/√3} ∈ [0,1/√3) is approximately 1/√3. Therefore, there should be infinitely many primes p where {p/√3} ∈ [0,1/√3). For such primes, we have p=√3 n - δ, where δ ∈ [0,1). Therefore, n= (p +δ)/√3. Since δ <1, n is approximately p/√3. But we need n to be an integer. However, the equidistribution tells us that {p/√3} is uniformly distributed, so for infinitely many primes p, {p/√3} falls in [0,1/√3). For those primes, there exists an integer n=⌊p/√3⌋ +1 such that ⌊√3 n⌋=p. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf {p/√3} ∈ [0,1/√3), then p/√3 = k + ε, where k=⌊p/√3⌋ and 0 ≤ε <1/√3. Then n=k+1 gives √3 n=√3(k+1)=√3 k +√3. Then p=√3 k +√3 ε. So ⌊√3 n⌋=⌊√3(k+1)⌋=⌊√3 k +√3⌋. But p=√3 k +√3 ε. Since ε <1/√3, then √3 ε <1. So p=√3 k + something less than 1. Therefore, ⌊√3(k+1)⌋=⌊√3 k +√3⌋. But this is not directly related to p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if {p/√3}=ε <1/√3, then p=√3 k +ε√3. Then n=k. Because then √3 n=√3 k ≤p <√3(k+1). But p=√3 k +ε√3, so √3 k ≤√3 k +ε√3 <√3(k+1) ⇒ 0 ≤ε <1. Which is true since ε= {p/√3} ∈ [0,1). But we need ε√3 <1, which is exactly ε <1/√3. Therefore, if {p/√3} <1/√3, then p=√3 k +ε√3 <√3 k +1, hence ⌊√3 k⌋ ≤p <√3 k +1. But ⌊√3 k⌋=floor(√3 k)=floor(p -ε√3). Since ε√3 <1, p -ε√3 >p -1. Therefore, floor(p -ε√3)=p -1 or p. If ε√3 <1, then p -ε√3 >p -1. So floor(p -ε√3) could be p-1 if p -ε√3 ≥p-1, i.e., ε√3 ≤1, which is always true. So floor(p -ε√3)=p -1, since p -ε√3 is in (p-1, p). Therefore, floor(√3 k)=p -1. But we wanted p=⌊√3 n⌋. So maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nPerhaps I need to accept that this problem is non-trivial and the answer relies on advanced number theory results. Given that the user is asking how to proceed from their analysis, and given that they mentioned a theorem about floor functions, maybe the intended approach is different.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's expansion, they expressed ⌊√3 n⌋ as either n, n+1, ..., up to 2n-1 depending on the fractional part of √3. Wait, let's check that. If n=1: floor(√3*1)=1. For n=2: floor(√3*2)=3. For n=3:5, n=4:6, n=5:8, n=6:10, n=7:12, n=8:13, etc. So the sequence is 1,3,5,6,8,10,12,13,... Each term is roughly √3 n. The user's expansion using the theorem gives that ⌊√3 n⌋=n +k, where k=0,1,...,n-1. But in reality, for each n, k=floor(n(√3 -1)). Since √3 -1≈0.732, k≈0.732n. For example, n=3: 0.732*3≈2.196⇒k=2⇒floor(√3*3)=3+2=5. Correct. Similarly, n=4:0.732*4≈2.928⇒k=2⇒floor(√3*4)=4+2=6. Correct. So in general, ⌊√3 n⌋=n + floor((√3 -1)n). Since √3 -1≈0.732 is irrational, floor((√3 -1)n) is approximately 0.732n.\n\nBut how does this help in proving infinitude of primes? The expression is n + floor((√3 -1)n)=floor(√3 n). The sequence is essentially the Beatty sequence as before.\n\nPerhaps the user's expansion was intended to express the sequence in terms of n and k, allowing to parametrize the sequence. If we let k=floor((√3 -1)n), then the sequence is n +k. Since (√3 -1)n =k +δ, where 0≤δ<1. Therefore, n +k =n +floor((√3 -1)n)=floor(n + (√3 -1)n)=floor(√3 n), which is consistent. But maybe express the sequence in terms of k:\n\nGiven k, then n +k=floor(√3 n). But solving for n is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, since √3 is irrational, the sequence {floor(√3 n)} is not a linear sequence and avoids nontrivial arithmetic progressions, making it hard to apply Dirichlet's theorem.\n\nIn conclusion, the problem seems to require advanced number theory results related to equidistribution of primes in Beatty sequences. The answer is likely that it's true under the assumption of the GRH or another conjecture, but proving it unconditionally is beyond current methods. However, based on equidistribution theorems for primes, one can argue heuristically that there are infinitely many primes in the sequence, but a rigorous proof would require citing deep results.\n\nSince the user asks to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem statement, and the original question doesn't mention any specific conditions (like n being in a certain congruence class), the assumptions are minimal. The user's own expansion refers to the theorem about floor functions, but they don't add extra conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the necessary assumptions inherent in the problem. The original problem states \"there are infinitely many primes of the form ⌊√3 n⌋\". The only assumption is that n is a positive integer, but since the user's expansion splits into cases based on n, but there's no restriction on n. However, in the example provided by the user, they had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the original problem doesn't state any restrictions on n, so the assumption is simply that n is a positive integer. However, looking at the example, the user included assumptions even if they are part of the problem's inherent setup. So following the example, even if the assumption is just \"n is an integer\", it should be listed.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that there are infinitely many primes of the form ⌊√3 ⋅ n⌋.\n\nBut the user's own expansion included a theorem and tried to split into cases. However, in their example, they included the divisibility condition which was part of the problem's assumption. In the current problem, the original question doesn't have any explicit conditions except that n is an integer. So the assumptions are only that n is an integer (positive, presumably, since we're talking about primes). However, sometimes in such problems, n is taken over all integers, but primes are positive, so n would be positive.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should list the assumption that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove/disprove infinitude of primes in the sequence.",
