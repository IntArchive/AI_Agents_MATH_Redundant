    "Content": "The ABC conjecture states that there are a finite number of integer triples (a,b,c) such that $\\frac {\\log \\left( c \\right)}{\\log \\left( \\text{rad} \\left( abc \\right) \\right)}>1+\\varepsilon $, where $a+b=c$ and $\\varepsilon > 0$. I am however more interested in a weaker version of the ABC conjecture where the following inequality holds true: $\\frac {\\log \\left( c \\right)}{\\log \\left( a \\: \\text{rad} \\left( bc \\right) \\right)}>1+\\varepsilon $.  This weaker conjecture has a number of applications in music theory - specifically concerning temperament theory. It is easy to see that this conjecture is implied by the ABC conjecture.  However, I was wondering if there is a way to prove it without relying on ABC.  Any clue where to start?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your conjecture is still open. Fix an integer $k$; your conjecture implies that there are finitely many solutions to the equation\n$$y^m = x^n + k$$\nfor exponents $n$, $m$ greater than one. For $k = 1$, this is Catalan's conjecture, which is now a theorem, but for $k > 1$ the finiteness of the number of solutions is still unknown; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijdeman%27s_theorem .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the original problem again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe question is about a weaker version of the ABC conjecture. The original ABC conjecture involves triples (a, b, c) where a + b = c. The standard conjecture states that for ε > 0, there are only finitely many triples such that log(c)/log(rad(abc)) > 1 + ε. \n\nThe weaker version proposed here changes the denominator to log(a * rad(bc)). The user is asking if this weaker version can be proven without relying on the ABC conjecture, and if there's a starting point for such a proof.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem statement:\n\n1. The problem involves integer triples (a, b, c) where a + b = c. That's an assumption about the relationship between a, b, c.\n2. The ABC conjecture's original form has ε > 0 and considers log(c)/log(rad(abc)) > 1 + ε. But here, the user is changing the denominator to log(a * rad(bc)). So the weaker conjecture has the inequality log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε. This is a condition on the triple (a, b, c) and ε.\n3. The user mentions that this weaker version is implied by the ABC conjecture, but they want to know if it can be proven without ABC. So perhaps an assumption here is that the proof shouldn't rely on the ABC conjecture, but the problem is to prove the weaker version.\n\nWait, but the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not the things the user wants. So the assumptions would be the hypotheses of the conjecture. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is about proving the weaker conjecture. The conjecture's assumptions are:\n\n- a, b, c are integers with a + b = c.\n- ε > 0.\n- The inequality log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε holds.\n\nWait, but in the ABC conjecture, it's that there are finitely many triples satisfying that inequality. So the problem here is to show that there are only finitely many triples (a, b, c) with a + b = c such that log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε for some ε > 0. Wait, no. The original ABC conjecture is that for any ε > 0, there are only finitely many triples with log(c)/log(rad(abc)) > 1 + ε. The weaker version here is similar but uses a * rad(bc) in the denominator instead of rad(abc). So the problem is to prove that, for any ε > 0, there are only finitely many triples (a, b, c) with a + b = c and gcd(a, b) = 1 (maybe?), such that log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε. Wait, but the standard ABC conjecture doesn't require gcd(a, b) = 1, but usually, in these conjectures, you assume that a, b, c are coprime, otherwise you can scale them. However, the user hasn't specified coprimality here. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe original question states: \"The ABC conjecture states that there are a finite number of integer triples (a,b,c) such that log(c)/log(rad(abc)) > 1 + ε, where a + b = c and ε > 0.\" Then the weaker version replaces rad(abc) with a * rad(bc). So the problem is to prove that there are finitely many triples (a, b, c) with a + b = c such that log(c)/(log(a * rad(bc))) > 1 + ε for a given ε > 0. But the user is asking if this can be proven without ABC.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c are integers.\n- a + b = c.\n- ε is a positive real number (ε > 0).\n- The inequality log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε holds.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that for every ε > 0, there are only finitely many triples (a, b, c) with a + b = c such that log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε. So the problem is the conjecture statement, and the assumptions would be the conditions on a, b, c, and ε.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a condition that applies to the problem. So for this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. a, b, c are integers.\n2. a + b = c.\n3. ε > 0.\n4. The inequality log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε holds.\n\nBut perhaps I need to break down each assumption into separate lines. However, the problem statement is about proving that under these conditions, there are only finitely many such triples. Wait, no. The problem is the conjecture itself. So the problem is to prove that for any ε > 0, there are only finitely many triples (a, b, c) with a + b = c such that log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c are integers.\n- a + b = c.\n- ε is a positive real number.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that there are finitely many such triples satisfying log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε.\n\nBut the example given in the original question's formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. But in this case, the problem is about a conjecture where the assumptions are a, b, c being integers, a + b = c, and ε > 0. Then the problem is to prove that only finitely many triples satisfy the inequality. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are integers,\na + b = c,\nε is a positive real number,\nthe inequality log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε holds.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that there are finitely many such triples for any ε > 0. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nFor every ε > 0,\na, b, c are integers with a + b = c,\nand the problem is to prove that there are finitely many triples where log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε.\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps each assumption should be a condition on the variables. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are positive integers,\na + b = c,\nε is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are only finitely many triples (a, b, c) such that \n$$\n\\frac{\\log(c)}{\\log(a \\cdot \\text{rad}(bc))} > 1 + \\varepsilon.\n$$\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user says \"the weaker conjecture where the following inequality holds true: log(c)/log(a rad(bc)) >1+ε\". So the conjecture is that there are only finitely many triples satisfying that inequality. Therefore, the problem is to prove that conjecture, and the assumptions are the conditions on a, b, c, and ε.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- a, b, c are integers,\n- a + b = c,\n- ε > 0,\n- log(c)/log(a rad(bc)) > 1 + ε.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, there are only finitely many such triples. Wait, but the conjecture is that for any ε >0, there are only finitely many triples (a,b,c) with a+b=c and log(c)/log(a rad(bc)) >1+ε. So the problem is to prove this statement. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- For every ε > 0,\n- a, b, c are integers with a + b = c,\n- The inequality log(c)/log(a rad(bc)) >1+ε holds.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under these conditions, there are only finitely many triples. Hmm, but the user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in that example, the assumptions were the conditions on n. Similarly here, the conditions on a, b, c, ε would be the assumptions. However, the problem is to prove that for any ε>0, there are finitely many triples (a,b,c) with a+b=c and log(c)/log(a rad(bc))>1+ε. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are integers,\na + b = c,\nε > 0,\nlog(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are only finitely many such triples (a, b, c).\n\nBut perhaps the ε is part of the problem's statement. Wait, the ABC conjecture is for any ε>0, there are finitely many triples satisfying that inequality. So the problem here is the same structure but with the modified denominator. So the problem would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that for every ε > 0, there are only finitely many integer triples (a, b, c) with a + b = c such that \n$$\n\\frac{\\log(c)}{\\log(a \\cdot \\text{rad}(bc))} > 1 + \\varepsilon.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c are integers,\n- a + b = c,\n- ε > 0,\n- The inequality holds.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption for the divisibility problem included that n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is to show that for any ε>0, the number of triples satisfying the inequality is finite. So the assumptions would be the general conditions on the variables and ε. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, the user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. That example might be a mistake. But according to the user's instruction, they provided that example. So maybe the user's example is wrong, but I have to follow their format. Wait, perhaps in the example, the original problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the user misrepresented it. Alternatively, perhaps there was a misunderstanding. But regardless, I need to follow the user's example as given.\n\nIn their example, the original problem is for every integer n, prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps there was a mistake in the example, but the user wants the assumptions to list all conditions, even if they are part of the problem's universal quantification. Wait, that's confusing. If the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption is just that n is an integer. The conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which would mean that the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's changing the original problem. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, but I need to proceed.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to list all the hypotheses and conditions in the problem as assumptions. For the current problem, the ABC conjecture's weaker version has the following conditions:\n\n1. a, b, c are integers.\n2. a + b = c.\n3. ε > 0.\n4. The inequality log(c)/log(a * rad(bc)) > 1 + ε holds.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that there are only finitely many triples (a, b, c) satisfying these conditions. So in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are integers,\na + b = c,\nε is a positive real number,\nthe inequality $\\frac{\\log(c)}{\\log(a \\cdot \\text{rad}(bc))} > 1 + \\varepsilon$ holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are only finitely many such triples (a, b, c).\n\nBut the original ABC conjecture is stated as \"for every ε >0, there are finitely many triples...\", so maybe the problem should capture that universality. However, the user's example seems to list the assumptions as the conditions on the variables in the problem, not the universal quantifiers. In the example, the original problem is for all integers n, but the formatted problem lists n is an integer and n divisible by 7, which seems to restrict it. So perhaps the user's format requires that any conditions on the variables (like n being an integer) are listed as assumptions, and the problem is the statement to prove under those assumptions. \n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. This changes the original problem's statement from \"for every integer n\" to \"for integer n divisible by 7\". That seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended to modify the problem. Given that, maybe the task is to filter out the unnecessary information and structure the problem with its actual assumptions. But in the current problem, the user is proposing a conjecture (a weaker ABC) and asking if it can be proven without ABC. So the problem is to prove that conjecture, which states that for any ε>0, there are finitely many triples (a,b,c) with a+b=c such that log(c)/log(a rad(bc)) >1+ε.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c are integers.\n- a + b = c.\n- ε > 0.\n- The inequality log(c)/log(a rad(bc)) >1+ε holds.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, there are only finitely many such triples.\n\nWait, but in the ABC conjecture, the \"for every ε>0\" part is a universal quantifier, not an assumption on ε. So maybe the problem statement should be: Prove that for every ε>0, there are only finitely many integer triples (a, b, c) with a + b = c such that log(c)/log(a rad(bc)) >1+ε.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c are integers,\n- a + b = c,\n- ε is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are only finitely many triples (a, b, c) satisfying \n$$\n\\frac{\\log(c)}{\\log(a \\cdot \\text{rad}(bc))} > 1 + \\varepsilon.\n$$\n\nBecause the \"for every ε>0\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption on a particular ε. But the user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the original problem was \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the format, the assumptions are the conditions that each instance must satisfy, and the problem is the conclusion. So in the example, even though the problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumptions list \"n is an integer\", and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 under that assumption.\n\nTherefore, applying that logic here, the problem would be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are integers,\na + b = c,\nε is a positive real number,\nthe inequality $\\frac{\\log(c)}{\\log(a \\cdot \\text{rad}(bc))} > 1 + \\varepsilon$ holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are only finitely many such triples (a, b, c).\n\nBut wait, in the original ABC conjecture, the statement is for any ε>0, there are finitely many triples. So the problem here is to prove that for any ε>0, the number of triples satisfying the inequality is finite. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nFor every ε > 0,\na, b, c are integers,\na + b = c,\nthe inequality $\\frac{\\log(c)}{\\log(a \\cdot \\text{rad}(bc))} > 1 + \\varepsilon$ holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are only finitely many triples (a, b, c).\n\nBut the \"for every ε>0\" is part of the problem's quantifier, not an assumption on ε. However, following the user's example, which converted \"for every integer n\" into an assumption that \"n is an integer\", perhaps here \"ε is a positive real number\" is an assumption. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c are integers,\n- a + b = c,\n- ε is a positive real number,\n- the inequality holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are only finitely many such triples.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The user's example might have a mistake, but I need to adhere to their format. Given that, I'll proceed with the assumptions as the conditions on a, b, c, and ε, and the problem as proving the finiteness.",
