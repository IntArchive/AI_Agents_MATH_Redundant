    "Content": "Problem Suppose $R$ is a normed linear space, then show that: If $M$ is closed subspace of $R$ and $N$ a finite dimensional subspace of $R$, then the set $$M+N=\\{ z : z = x + y , x \\in M , y \\in N  \\}$$\nis a closed subspace of $R$. What I've done I know being finite dimensional makes $N$ closed. Also I can disjointize $M$ and $N$ so that I have a direct sum instead of sum. But I don't know if the direct sum of closed subspaces are closed. I try taking a convergent sequence but i cant control the limit point. I even tried induction but cant show the 1-dimensional case. Could you please help me?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Look at the quotient space $X/M$. Because $M$ is known to be closed, then $Y=X/M$ is a normed space under the quotient norm. Let $\\phi : X\\rightarrow X/M$ be the quotient map. Then $\\phi$ is continuous because $\\|\\phi(x)\\|_{X/M}\\le \\|x\\|_{X}$. Furthermore, $\\phi(M+N)$ is finite-dimensional and, hence, closed in $X/M$. Therefore $M+N=\\phi^{-1}(\\phi(M+N))$ is closed.",

Thus, $N$ is closed.\n   - The quotient space $R/M$ is a normed space under the norm $\\|z + M\\|_{R/M} = \\inf_{x \\in M} \\|z - x\\|$.\n\n2. **Quotient Map Approach:**\n   - Let $\\pi: R \\to R/M$ be the natural quotient map, defined by $\\pi(z) = z + M$. This map is linear and continuous.\n   - Since $N$ is finite-dimensional, its image $\\pi(N)$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $R/M$ and thus closed in $R/M$ (as all finite-dimensional subspaces of normed spaces are closed).\n\n3. **Preimage of $\\pi(N)$:**\n   - The preimage $\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(N))$ is exactly $M + N$, because:\n     \\[\n     z \\in \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(N)) \\iff \\pi(z) \\in \\pi(N) \\iff \\exists y \\in N,\\, \\pi(z) = \\pi(y) \\iff z - y \\in M \\iff z \\in M + N.\n     \\]\n   - Since $\\pi(N)$ is closed in $R/M$ and $\\pi$ is continuous, the preimage $\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(N)) = M + N$ is closed in $R$.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, $M + N$ is closed in $R$.\n\n**Alternative Approach (Sequential Argument):**\n- Let $\\{z_n\\}$ be a sequence in $M + N$ converging to $z \\in R$. Write $z_n = x_n + y_n$ where $x_n \\in M$, $y_n \\in N$.\n- Since $N$ is finite-dimensional, the sequence $\\{y_n\\}$ has a convergent subsequence $\\{y_{n_k}\\}$ (by Bolzano-Weierstrass in finite dimensions). Let $y_{n_k} \\to y \\in N$.\n- Then $x_{n_k} = z_{n_k} - y_{n_k} \\to z - y$. Since $M$ is closed, $z - y \\in M$. Hence, $z = (z - y) + y \\in M + N$, proving $M + N$ is closed.\n\nBoth methods confirm that $M + N$ is closed in $R$.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the problem is to show that if M is a closed subspace of a normed linear space R and N is a finite-dimensional subspace of R, then the sum M + N is a closed subspace. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some relevant concepts. A subspace being closed means that every convergent sequence within the subspace has its limit also in the subspace. Since N is finite-dimensional, I know that in normed spaces, finite-dimensional subspaces are closed. That's a useful point. So both M and N are closed subspaces. But the sum of two closed subspaces isn't always closed. There must be something special about one of them being finite-dimensional.\n\nThe user mentioned they tried taking a convergent sequence in M + N and couldn't control the limit. Let me think about that approach. Suppose we have a sequence z_n = x_n + y_n where x_n is in M and y_n is in N, and suppose z_n converges to some z in R. We need to show that z can be written as x + y with x in M and y in N.\n\nSince N is finite-dimensional, maybe we can use some compactness argument? In finite-dimensional spaces, closed bounded sets are compact. But we're in a normed space, which might not be complete. Wait, R is just a normed linear space, not necessarily a Banach space. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that any finite-dimensional subspace is complemented in a normed space? Wait, no, that's true in Banach spaces via the Hahn-Banach theorem, but even then, not necessarily. Wait, actually, in normed spaces, if you have a finite-dimensional subspace, you can find a complementary subspace. Is that true? Let me recall. If N is finite-dimensional, then there exists a closed subspace such that the space is the direct sum of N and that subspace. Wait, maybe that's only in Banach spaces. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use induction on the dimension of N. The user mentioned trying induction but couldn't handle the 1-dimensional case. Let's try the 1-dimensional case first. Suppose N is 1-dimensional, spanned by a single vector v. So any element of N is of the form αv where α is a scalar.\n\nTake a sequence z_n = x_n + α_n v in M + N converging to z. We need to show z is in M + N. If we can show that α_n converges to some α and x_n converges to some x in M, then z = x + αv, which is in M + N. But how to show that?\n\nIf we can bound the coefficients α_n, then maybe we can extract a convergent subsequence. Since v is fixed, maybe we can use the norm to relate α_n to the norm of z_n. Let me consider the quotient space R/M. Since M is closed, R/M is a normed space. The projection π: R → R/M sends z_n to π(z_n) = α_n π(v). Since z_n converges, π(z_n) converges in R/M. Since R/M is a normed space and π(v) is a fixed non-zero element (if v is not in M), then α_n must converge. Wait, but if v is in M, then N is contained in M, so M + N = M, which is closed. So maybe we can assume that N is not entirely contained in M. Or, even if it is, then the sum is just M, which is closed.\n\nBut if v is not in M, then π(v) ≠ 0 in R/M. Then π(z_n) = α_n π(v) converges in R/M. Let me denote the limit as π(z) = α π(v). Since π is continuous, we have π(z_n) → π(z). Therefore, α_n must converge to some α because π(v) is a fixed non-zero element. Therefore, α_n converges to α, which means that x_n = z_n - α_n v converges to z - α v. Since M is closed, z - α v must be in M, so z = (z - α v) + α v is in M + N.\n\nOh, that seems to work for the 1-dimensional case. Then by induction, maybe we can extend this to higher dimensions. Suppose N is k-dimensional, and assume the result holds for (k-1)-dimensional subspaces. Let N be spanned by vectors v_1, ..., v_k. Then we can write N as N' + span{v_k}, where N' is (k-1)-dimensional. Then M + N = (M + N') + span{v_k}. By the induction hypothesis, M + N' is closed, and then adding a 1-dimensional subspace would preserve closedness by the 1-dimensional case. Hence, by induction, M + N is closed.\n\nBut wait, does this induction step work? Let's check. Suppose M + N' is closed. Then adding span{v_k} to it, which is a 1-dimensional subspace, should be closed by the same argument as before. So if we have two closed subspaces, one of which is finite-dimensional, their sum is closed. But wait, in the induction step, we need to have that if A is closed and B is finite-dimensional, then A + B is closed. So if we have already that M + N' is closed (by induction), then adding span{v_k} (finite-dimensional) should be closed. That seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the fact that any linear operator from a finite-dimensional space to a quotient space is continuous. Since N is finite-dimensional, we can consider the quotient map π: R → R/M. The image of N under π is a finite-dimensional subspace of R/M. Since finite-dimensional subspaces are closed, the image π(N) is closed. Then, since π is continuous, the preimage of π(N) under π is closed. But the preimage of π(N) is M + N. Therefore, M + N is closed.\n\nWait, that might be a more straightforward approach. Let me elaborate. The quotient space R/M is a normed space because M is closed. The quotient map π: R → R/M is continuous and linear. Then π(N) is a finite-dimensional subspace of R/M. Since finite-dimensional subspaces are closed in any normed space, π(N) is closed. Therefore, the preimage π^{-1}(π(N)) is closed in R. But π^{-1}(π(N)) is exactly M + N. Hence, M + N is closed.\n\nThat seems like a clean proof. So the key idea is using the quotient space and the fact that the image of N under the quotient map is finite-dimensional, hence closed, and the preimage of a closed set under a continuous map is closed. Therefore, M + N is closed.\n\nBut let me check if all the steps are valid. The quotient map is continuous, yes. The image of N under π is π(N), which is a subspace of R/M. Since N is finite-dimensional, π(N) is finite-dimensional, hence closed. Then the preimage of π(N) under π is M + N, because any element in M + N is mapped to π(N), and vice versa. Therefore, since π is continuous and π(N) is closed, the preimage is closed. That seems correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is that M + N is closed. Therefore, the problem is solved by considering the quotient space and properties of finite-dimensional subspaces being closed.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using sequences. Suppose z_n = x_n + y_n converges to z. We want to show z is in M + N. If we can show that y_n is bounded, then since N is finite-dimensional, we can extract a convergent subsequence y_{n_k} → y in N (because closed and bounded sets in finite-dimensional spaces are compact). Then x_{n_k} = z_{n_k} - y_{n_k} converges to z - y. Since M is closed, z - y is in M, so z = (z - y) + y is in M + N.\n\nBut wait, why is y_n bounded? If we can show that ||y_n|| is bounded, then we can apply compactness. Suppose not, then maybe ||y_n|| → infinity. But since z_n = x_n + y_n converges, perhaps we can derive a contradiction. Let me formalize this.\n\nAssume ||y_n|| → infinity. Then consider the normalized sequence y_n / ||y_n||. Since N is finite-dimensional, the unit sphere is compact, so there's a subsequence y_{n_k}/||y_{n_k}|| converging to some y in N with ||y|| = 1. Then:\n\n(z_{n_k} - x_{n_k}) / ||y_{n_k}|| = y_{n_k}/||y_{n_k}|| → y.\n\nBut z_{n_k} converges to z, so (z_{n_k} - x_{n_k}) / ||y_{n_k}|| = y_{n_k}/||y_{n_k}||. Let me rearrange:\n\nx_{n_k} = z_{n_k} - y_{n_k}.\n\nDividing by ||y_{n_k}||:\n\nx_{n_k}/||y_{n_k}|| = z_{n_k}/||y_{n_k}|| - y_{n_k}/||y_{n_k}||.\n\nAs k→infty, z_{n_k}/||y_{n_k}|| → 0 since z_{n_k} converges to z and ||y_{n_k}|| → infinity. So the left side x_{n_k}/||y_{n_k}|| converges to -y. But x_{n_k} is in M, which is closed. Therefore, -y must be in M. But y is in N and has norm 1. Since M and N are subspaces, if -y is in M and y is in N, then y is in M ∩ N. But if M and N are in direct sum, then their intersection is {0}, which contradicts ||y||=1. However, the problem didn't assume M and N are disjoint. Wait, the user mentioned they tried to disjointize them, but maybe that's not necessary.\n\nSo if y is in M ∩ N, then y is in M and in N. So in this case, y is in M, so the limit y is in M. But ||y||=1, so y ≠ 0. But how does that lead to a contradiction?\n\nAlternatively, since y is in M and in N, and N is finite-dimensional, but M is closed, maybe there's a contradiction. But unless M and N have a non-trivial intersection, which is possible. So this approach might not work unless we can ensure that M ∩ N = {0}. But the problem doesn't assume that. So maybe this method isn't the right way.\n\nAlternatively, the quotient space approach seems more straightforward. It doesn't require M and N to be disjoint. The key is that the image of N in the quotient is closed, so the preimage is closed. Therefore, M + N is closed.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the problem can be solved either by induction on the dimension of N, handling the 1-dimensional case via the quotient space, or directly using the quotient space argument. The quotient space method seems more elegant and doesn't require induction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to use the quotient map and properties of finite-dimensional subspaces being closed.",
