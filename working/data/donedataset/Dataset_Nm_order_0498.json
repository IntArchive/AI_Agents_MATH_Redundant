    "Content": "I am looking for a non-trivial function $f(x)\\in L_2(0,\\infty)$ independent of the parameter $n$ (a natural number) satisfying the following integral equation: $$\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{1+e^{nx}}dx=0$$ or prove that $f(x)=0$ is the only solution. The similar question is here but there are no parameters in the integral and the answer is based upon hit and trial method. I want to know what would be the nice approach to tackle this problem.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "The only such function is $f\\equiv 0$ . The proof is fairly standard but if you've never seen such machinery before, it may take some time and effort to comprehend, so feel free to ask questions if something is unclear. Lemma:  If $f$ satisfies the condition, then $F(z)=\\int_{0}^\\infty \\frac{f(x)}{1+e^{zx}}dx=0$ for all real $z>0$ . Proof: $F$ is analytic in the right half-plane $\\Re z>0$ and, moreover, grows at most polynomially in $\\Re z>1$ , say. Thus $z^{-N}F(z)$ is a bounded analytic function in $\\Re z>1$ . By hypothesis, $F$ has zeroes at all integer points, and $F$ must vanish identically (the Blaschke condition is violated). This proves the lemma. By the lemma, if $f$ satisfies the condition, then $\\int f(x)K_t(x)dx=0$ for all $t$ , where $K_t(x)=\\frac 1{1+e^{tx}}$ .  So the main result will follow from the density of the family $K_t$ in $L^2(0,+\\infty)$ .  This the same as the density of the family $k_t$ in $L^2((0,+\\infty),\\frac{dx}{x})$ where $k_t(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt{tx}}{1+e^{tx}}$ . Up to a logarithmic change of variable, this is also the same as the problem about completeness of shifts in $L^2(\\mathbb R)$ . The answer is given by the Wiener criterion: the family is dense if the Fourier transform of the generating function vanishes only on a set of measure $0$ . So the family is dense if the transform $$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sqrt x}{1+e^x}x^{-is}\\,\\frac{dx}x\\ne 0\n$$ for almost all $s\\in\\mathbb R$ . But the left hand side is analytic in $s$ for $|\\Im s|<\\frac 12$ , and not identically zero, so the real zeroes of the transform are at most a discrete set, and the transforms are non-zero for almost all $s$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So, the question is to find a non-trivial function f(x) in L²(0, ∞) that's independent of the natural number n, such that the integral of f(x)/(1 + e^{nx}) dx from 0 to ∞ is zero for all n. Or to prove that only f(x)=0 works.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the assumptions. The function f is in L², which means it's square-integrable over (0, ∞). It must be independent of n, so the same f works for all natural numbers n. The integral condition has to hold for every n in natural numbers. The example given by Stieltjes is interesting, where a specific function satisfies similar integral conditions with x^n instead. That example uses substitution and integration by parts, so maybe similar techniques apply here.\n\nBut here, instead of x^n, we have 1/(1 + e^{nx}). The denominator here is similar to Fermi-Dirac distribution functions, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. The key is that the integral must vanish for all n. So, maybe the approach is to consider a set of functions that can span the space, and show that f must be orthogonal to all of them, implying f=0. But the example shows that sometimes non-trivial functions can satisfy such conditions, so maybe the answer isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, the user mentions that in the similar question without parameters, the answer was hit and trial, but here with parameter n, maybe a different approach is needed. Let me think about the integral transform aspect. The integral equation can be seen as the inner product of f(x) with 1/(1 + e^{nx}) being zero for all n. If these functions 1/(1 + e^{nx}) form a complete set in L²(0, ∞), then the only function orthogonal to all of them is zero. But is that the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can make a substitution to relate this to Fourier transforms or Mellin transforms. Let me try substituting t = e^x. Let x = ln t, so dx = dt/t. Then the integral becomes ∫_{1}^{\\∞} f(ln t)/(1 + t^n) * (1/t) dt. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let u = nx, so x = u/n, dx = du/n. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ f(u/n)/(1 + e^u) * (du/n). So, 1/n ∫₀^∞ f(u/n)/(1 + e^u) du = 0 for all n. Maybe taking the limit as n approaches infinity? As n grows, u/n becomes small, so f(u/n) ≈ f(0) + f’(0)u/n + ... But if this holds for all n, maybe this imposes conditions on the moments of f(u/n). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding 1/(1 + e^{nx}) as a series. For example, 1/(1 + e^{nx}) = e^{-nx}/(1 + e^{-nx}) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k e^{-(k+1)nx}, which converges for x > 0. Then the integral becomes Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k ∫₀^∞ f(x) e^{-(k+1)nx} dx = 0. So, the integral is the Laplace transform of f at s = (k+1)n. So, Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k L[f]((k+1)n) = 0 for all n ∈ ℕ.\n\nBut this has to hold for all n. If the Laplace transform of f is zero at all points (k+1)n for all k ≥ 0 and n ∈ ℕ, then maybe L[f] must be zero almost everywhere? Because the set {(k+1)n | k, n ∈ ℕ} is dense in (0, ∞). If the Laplace transform is analytic and zero on a set with accumulation points, then it's identically zero. But f ∈ L², so its Laplace transform is analytic in the right half-plane. So if the Laplace transform is zero on a sequence with an accumulation point, then L[f] ≡ 0, implying f ≡ 0. Hence, f must be zero. But wait, the example given by Stieltjes is a function that has all moments zero, but is non-zero. However, in that case, the moments are ∫ x^n f(x) dx = 0 for all n, which is similar to the Hamburger moment problem. If a function has all moments zero, under certain conditions, it must be zero. But in the Stieltjes example, the function isn't zero, but it's constructed in such a way that all the moments vanish. Wait, but that example might not be in L². Let me check: f(x) = exp(-x^{1/4}) sin(x^{1/4}). Let's compute the L² norm: ∫₀^∞ |exp(-x^{1/4}) sin(x^{1/4})|² dx. Substitute t = x^{1/4}, x = t^4, dx = 4t³ dt. Then integral becomes ∫₀^∞ e^{-2t} sin²(t) * 4 t³ dt. This converges because e^{-2t} decays exponentially. So yes, it's in L². So, how come this function has all moments zero? Because when you compute ∫ x^n f(x) dx, you get zero for all n ≥ 0. But in our problem, the integral is ∫ f(x)/(1 + e^{nx}) dx = 0 for all n. So, similar but different. In the example, the integral with x^n is zero for all n, which is a system of equations that a non-trivial function can satisfy. In our case, it's integrals against 1/(1 + e^{nx}) for all n. Perhaps the difference is that the functions 1/(1 + e^{nx}) form a complete set, so the only function orthogonal to all of them is zero. Alternatively, maybe we can relate the two problems. Let's think: if we can expand 1/(1 + e^{nx}) in terms of exponentials or other functions that relate to x^n. Wait, in the Stieltjes example, the function f is orthogonal to all monomials x^n. In our problem, it's orthogonal to 1/(1 + e^{nx}). Maybe we can use the fact that 1/(1 + e^{nx}) can be approximated by linear combinations of exponentials, which might relate to moments. Alternatively, if we can expand in terms of a basis where the function's orthogonality would force it to be zero. Another approach: consider that for each n, 1/(1 + e^{nx}) is a function in L²(0, ∞). If the set {1/(1 + e^{nx}) | n ∈ ℕ} is dense in L², then f must be zero. But is this set dense? Alternatively, consider that as n increases, 1/(1 + e^{nx}) tends to the indicator function of (0, ∞) scaled somehow. Wait, as n→infty, e^{nx} dominates for x > 0, so 1/(1 + e^{nx}) ≈ 0 for x > 0. Wait, no: for fixed x, as n increases, e^{nx} blows up, so 1/(1 + e^{nx}) tends to 0. For x=0, it's 1/2. So in the limit as n→infty, the function tends to 0 for x>0 and 1/2 at x=0. Not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, for n approaching zero, but n is a natural number, so n ≥ 1. Hmm. Let me think about n=1: 1/(1 + e^x), n=2: 1/(1 + e^{2x}), etc. These functions decay exponentially at infinity, and at x=0, they are 1/2, 1/(1 + 1)=1/2, etc. Maybe using the density of such functions in L². If they form a complete set, then f must be zero. Alternatively, use the fact that the Laplace transforms of these functions are related, and the integral condition imposes that combinations of Laplace transforms are zero. But I'm not sure. Let's consider taking the Mellin transform. The Mellin transform of 1/(1 + e^{nx}) might relate to the zeta function or something similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider the substitution t = e^x, then x = ln t, dx = dt/t. Then the integral becomes ∫_{1}^\\infty f(ln t)/(1 + t^n) * (1/t) dt. Maybe writing t^n as (t)^n, and considering the integral over t from 1 to ∞. Not sure. Alternatively, think of the integral as ∫₀^∞ f(x) g_n(x) dx = 0 for all n, where g_n(x) = 1/(1 + e^{nx}). If the span of {g_n} is dense in L², then f=0. To check if the set {g_n} is dense, we can use the fact that if the only function orthogonal to all g_n is zero. Suppose there exists a non-zero f ∈ L² orthogonal to all g_n. Then, for all n, ∫₀^∞ f(x)/(1 + e^{nx}) dx = 0. Maybe we can relate this to the Fourier transform or another transform. For example, consider that 1/(1 + e^{nx}) = (1 - e^{-nx})^{-1} - 1, but not sure. Alternatively, expand in a series: 1/(1 + e^{nx}) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k e^{-(k+1)nx}, as I did before. Then, ∫₀^∞ f(x) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k e^{-(k+1)nx} dx = 0. So, Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k L[f]((k+1)n) = 0 for all n. If this holds for all n, then perhaps the Laplace transform of f at points (k+1)n is such that the alternating sum is zero. But how to proceed from here? Suppose we denote s = (k+1)n. If for each n, the sum over k of (-1)^k L[f](s) = 0 where s = n, 2n, 3n, etc. This seems complicated. Alternatively, fix n and vary k. Wait, no, for each n, we have a sum over k. It might be challenging. Another approach: suppose we take n=1: Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k L[f](k+1) = 0. For n=2: Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k L[f](2(k+1)) = 0. And so on. If these equations hold for all n, maybe we can use some uniqueness property. Suppose that L[f] is zero at all integers s=1,2,3,... Then by the identity theorem for analytic functions, if L[f] is analytic and zero at integers, and if the integers have an accumulation point in the domain of analyticity, then L[f] is identically zero. But the Laplace transform of an L² function is analytic in the right half-plane. The integers are on the real line starting at 1, which is a sequence going to infinity. However, they don't have an accumulation point in the complex plane, so the identity theorem doesn't apply directly. So that approach might not work. But if the alternating sum of L[f] at multiples of n is zero for all n, perhaps this forces L[f] to be zero. Alternatively, consider that for each n, the equation is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k L[f]((k+1)n) = 0. Let m = (k+1), so Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m-1} L[f](m n) = 0. So, Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m-1} L[f](m n) = 0 for all n ∈ ℕ. If this is true for all n, then perhaps L[f] must be zero. For example, suppose we set n=1: Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m-1} L[f](m) = 0. For n=2: Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m-1} L[f](2m) = 0. And so on. If we can solve these equations recursively, maybe we find that all L[f](m) = 0. For instance, take n=1: Let’s denote a_m = L[f](m). Then the equation is a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + ... = 0. For n=2: a_2 - a_4 + a_6 - a_8 + ... = 0. For n=3: a_3 - a_6 + a_9 - a_12 + ... = 0. And so on. If we can show that all a_m must be zero. Let's see. Let’s assume these series converge absolutely. From n=1: a_1 = a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - a_5 + ... From n=2: a_2 = a_4 - a_6 + a_8 - ... From n=3: a_3 = a_6 - a_9 + a_12 - ... And so on. If we substitute the expression for a_2 into the first equation: a_1 = (a_4 - a_6 + a_8 - ...) - a_3 + a_4 - a_5 + ... Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe if we proceed by induction. Suppose that for all m > N, a_m = 0. Then for n=1, the sum becomes up to m=N. But without knowing the decay of a_m, it's hard. Alternatively, if we suppose that a_m decays rapidly enough, the infinite sums converge, and then the system of equations implies all a_m =0. For example, if a_m =0 for all m, then the equations are satisfied. But to show that this is the only solution, suppose there exists a non-zero a_m. Let’s say a_1 ≠0. Then from n=1, a_1 = a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - ... But from n=2, a_2 = a_4 - a_6 + ... If we substitute a_2 from n=2 into the first equation: a_1 = (a_4 - a_6 + ...) - a_3 + a_4 - a_5 + ... Combining terms: a_1 = -a_3 + 2a_4 - a_5 - a_6 + ... Similarly, proceeding recursively, but this might not lead to a contradiction unless we have more information. Alternatively, if we take n approaching infinity. For large n, the terms a_{m n} are evaluations of the Laplace transform at large arguments. For a function in L², the Laplace transform at s→infty tends to zero, because L[f](s) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-s x} f(x) dx. As s increases, the integral is dominated by x near zero. If f is in L², then by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, L[f](s) tends to zero as s→infty. But how does this help? If we take n large, then m n is large for m ≥1, so each term a_{m n} is small. So for large n, the sum Σ (-1)^{m-1} a_{m n} ≈0. But this is automatically satisfied if a_{m n} →0 as n→infty, which they do. So no contradiction here. Another angle: use the density of the functions 1/(1 + e^{nx}) in L². If these functions span a dense subspace, then f must be zero. To check density, one approach is to use the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, but that applies to continuous functions on compact intervals. Alternatively, consider that the set {1/(1 + e^{nx})} is total in L²(0, ∞) if the only function orthogonal to all of them is zero. Suppose f is orthogonal to all 1/(1 + e^{nx}). Can we approximate characteristic functions with linear combinations of 1/(1 + e^{nx})? For example, for any interval [a,b], can we find a linear combination that approximates the characteristic function χ_[a,b]? If yes, then f must be orthogonal to all such χ_[a,b], implying f=0. But proving this approximation is non-trivial. Alternatively, consider that the functions 1/(1 + e^{nx}) are related to the Fermi-Dirac distribution and form a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, think of the integral as a inner product in L²: ⟨f, g_n⟩ =0 for all n, where g_n(x)=1/(1 + e^{nx}). If the span of {g_n} is dense, then f=0. To check density, one can use the fact that if a function h is orthogonal to all g_n, then h=0. Suppose there exists h≠0 such that ⟨h, g_n⟩=0 for all n. Then ∫₀^∞ h(x)/(1 + e^{nx}) dx=0 for all n. If we can show that h must be zero, then the set {g_n} is dense. But this is exactly the original problem. Hence, circular reasoning. Maybe we need to use the example given. The Stieltjes example shows that for certain integral conditions (all moments zero), a non-trivial function exists. However, in our case, the integral conditions are different. Maybe the difference is that the functions 1/(1 + e^{nx}} are not powers of x, but decay exponentially. The set of such functions might be more restrictive, leading to only f=0. Alternatively, use the uniqueness of analytic continuation. If we can show that the integral condition implies that the Mellin transform of f is zero, which would imply f=0. Let’s explore that. The Mellin transform of f is M[f](s) = ∫₀^∞ x^{s-1} f(x) dx. Our integral is ∫₀^∞ f(x)/(1 + e^{nx}) dx. Let’s relate this to the Mellin transform. Maybe substitute t = nx, so x = t/n, dx = dt/n. Then integral becomes ∫₀^∞ f(t/n)/(1 + e^t) * dt/n. So, 1/n ∫₀^∞ f(t/n)/(1 + e^t) dt =0 for all n. If we let n→infty, then t/n→0, so f(t/n)≈f(0) + f’(0) t/n + ... Assuming f is smooth at 0, then the integral becomes approximately [f(0) + ... ]/n ∫₀^∞ 1/(1 + e^t) dt. The integral ∫₀^∞ 1/(1 + e^t) dt = ln 2. So, approximately f(0) ln 2 /n =0 for all n, implying f(0)=0. Similarly, expanding to higher orders might give f^(k)(0)=0 for all k. If f is analytic and all derivatives at zero vanish, then f≡0. But f is only assumed to be in L², so it might not be smooth or have derivatives at zero. This approach might not be valid. Alternatively, for each n, consider the integral as the Laplace transform evaluated at n, but with a weight. Wait, no, the integral is ∫ f(x)/(1 + e^{nx}) dx. If we write 1/(1 + e^{nx}) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-t(1 + e^{nx})} dt, but not sure. Alternatively, use the integral representation 1/(1 + e^{nx}) = 1/2 - (1/2) tanh(nx/2). Then the integral becomes 1/2 ∫ f(x) dx - 1/2 ∫ f(x) tanh(nx/2) dx =0. So, ∫ f(x) dx = ∫ f(x) tanh(nx/2) dx for all n. But as n→infty, tanh(nx/2) tends to 1 for x>0 and 0 for x=0. So, in the limit, ∫ f(x) dx = ∫ f(x) dx, which is trivial. For n→0, but n is a natural number, so this might not help. Alternatively, take derivative with respect to n. Differentiate the integral equation with respect to n. But the integral is over x, and n is a discrete parameter. Maybe considering n as a continuous variable? But the problem states n is a natural number. Maybe not. Alternatively, consider that for all n, the integral equals zero. If we can invert the integral transform, we might find f=0. For example, suppose we have ∫₀^∞ f(x) k(n,x) dx =0 for all n, where k(n,x)=1/(1 + e^{nx}). If the kernel k(n,x) is such that the integral transform is injective, then f=0. To check if the transform is injective, we need to verify that the only f giving zero is f=0. This depends on the properties of the kernel. In some cases, such as the Laplace or Fourier transform, injectivity holds. Here, the kernel is 1/(1 + e^{nx}). I'm not sure about its injectivity. Alternatively, consider that the set {1/(1 + e^{nx})} for n ∈ ℕ is a determining set for L². If so, then f=0. Alternatively, use the fact that if f is orthogonal to all functions of the form 1/(1 + e^{nx}), then it's orthogonal to their linear combinations and limits, which might form a dense subset. However, without a theorem to back this up, it's hard to proceed. Another approach: use the fact that the functions 1/(1 + e^{nx}) can be expressed as a difference of exponentials. For example, 1/(1 + e^{nx}) = e^{-nx}/(1 + e^{-nx}) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k e^{-(k+1)nx} as mentioned earlier. Then the integral equation becomes Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k ∫₀^∞ f(x) e^{-(k+1)nx} dx =0 for all n. Let’s denote L[f]((k+1)n) = ∫₀^∞ f(x) e^{-(k+1)nx} dx. So, Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k L[f]((k+1)n) =0 for all n ∈ ℕ. Now, if we can vary n, then for each n, this equation involves the Laplace transform of f at points (k+1)n. Suppose we fix m = n and let k vary, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, for each m ∈ ℕ, let n = m. Then, the equation becomes Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k L[f]((k+1)m) =0. This must hold for each m. If we can show that this implies L[f](m) =0 for all m, then since the Laplace transform is analytic, and it vanishes at integers m, which are discrete points, but analytic continuation would require L[f] to be zero everywhere, hence f=0. However, the problem is that the sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k L[f]((k+1)m) =0 involves multiple points for each m. For example, for m=1, we have L[f](1) - L[f](2) + L[f](3) - ... =0. For m=2, L[f](2) - L[f](4) + L[f](6) - ...=0. For m=3, L[f](3) - L[f](6) + L[f](9) - ...=0. This forms a system of equations. Let’s denote a_p = L[f](p) for p ∈ ℕ. Then, for m=1: a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + ... =0. For m=2: a_2 - a_4 + a_6 - a_8 + ...=0. For m=3: a_3 - a_6 + a_9 - a_12 + ...=0. Etc. Let’s see if we can solve this system. Suppose we subtract the m=2 equation from the m=1 equation. From m=1: a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + a_5 - ...=0. From m=2: a_2 - a_4 + a_6 - ...=0. Subtract m=2 from m=1: a_1 + a_3 - a_2 + a_5 - a_6 + ...=0. But this doesn't directly help. Alternatively, express a_1 from m=1: a_1 = a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - a_5 + ... From m=2: a_2 = a_4 - a_6 + a_8 - ... Substitute a_2 into the expression for a_1: a_1 = (a_4 - a_6 + a_8 - ...) - a_3 + a_4 - a_5 + ... = -a_3 + 2a_4 - a_5 - a_6 + a_8 + ... Similarly, from m=3: a_3 = a_6 - a_9 + a_12 - ... Substitute into a_1: a_1 = -(a_6 - a_9 + ...) + 2a_4 - a_5 - a_6 + a_8 + ... This becomes complicated, but if we assume that the function f has compact support, then a_p = L[f](p) would decay exponentially for large p. However, even then, it's not clear how to show all a_p=0. Alternatively, if we assume that a_p=0 for all p, then the equations are satisfied. But to show uniqueness, we need to prove no non-trivial solutions exist. Suppose there exists a non-zero a_p. Let’s suppose a_1 ≠0. Then from m=1: a_1 = a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - ... If a_1 is non-zero, there must be some cancellation in the series. But how can we be sure this isn't possible? It's similar to an infinite system of equations with infinitely many variables. Such systems can have non-trivial solutions under certain conditions. However, if the system is such that each equation involves disjoint variables except for overlaps, it might force all variables to zero. For example, consider m=1 equation involves a_1, a_2, a_3, etc. The m=2 equation involves a_2, a_4, a_6, etc. The m=3 equation involves a_3, a_6, a_9, etc. Notice that each a_p appears in exactly one equation corresponding to m=p's divisors. For instance, a_6 appears in m=1, m=2, and m=3 equations. This complex interdependency might make the system have only the trivial solution. Alternatively, if we use induction: suppose for all p < N, a_p=0, then show a_N=0. For example, take N=1. If p=1 is the first non-zero term. From m=1: a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - ... =0. If all a_p=0 for p≥2, then a_1=0. Contradiction. So a_1 must be zero. Then consider p=2. From m=2: a_2 - a_4 + a_6 - ...=0. If all a_p=0 for p≥3, then a_2=0. Similarly, by induction, all a_p=0. Therefore, the only solution is a_p=0 for all p, implying L[f] is zero at all positive integers. Since the Laplace transform is analytic and zero at a sequence of points approaching infinity, which is not an accumulation point in the domain of analyticity (right half-plane), this doesn't directly imply L[f]=0. However, if we have more information, like L[f] is zero on a sequence with an accumulation point in the domain, then by identity theorem, L[f]=0. But the positive integers don't have an accumulation point in the complex plane. Thus, we can't apply the identity theorem here. Therefore, even if a_p=0 for all p ∈ ℕ, L[f] could be non-zero elsewhere, but since f ∈ L², the Laplace transform is analytic in the right half-plane. However, if we consider that the equations Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k L[f]((k+1)n) =0 hold for all n ∈ ℕ, then for any s= n, 2n, 3n, etc., but this might not cover enough points. Wait, but for any s which is a multiple of any natural number, i.e., all s ∈ ℕ. So the Laplace transform is zero at all s ∈ ℕ. Even though the natural numbers don't have an accumulation point in the complex plane, there's a theorem by Lerch (Lerch's theorem) which states that if two functions have the same Laplace transform at a sequence of points approaching infinity, then they are equal almost everywhere. But in our case, we have L[f](s)=0 for all s ∈ ℕ. If two functions have L[f1}(s)=L[f2}(s) for s ∈ ℕ, then f1=f2 almost everywhere. But since we have L[f}(s)=0 for all s ∈ ℕ, then f must be zero almost everywhere. Wait, is that true? Lerch's theorem says that if L[f](s_n) = L[g}(s_n) for a sequence s_n → ∞, then f=g a.e. So, in our case, if we take s_n =n, which tends to infinity, and L[f}(n)=0 for all n, then by Lerch's theorem, f=0 a.e. Therefore, this would imply f=0 is the only solution. Hence, the only function satisfying the integral equations is f=0. Therefore, the answer is that f(x)=0 is the only solution. The Stieltjes example is different because the integral conditions there are for all n≥0, ∫ x^n f(x) dx=0, which is a different set of conditions. In that case, the functions x^n do not form a determining set for L²(0, ∞) because of the existence of non-trivial functions with all moments zero. However, in our problem, the integral conditions correspond to the Laplace transform at integers being zero, which by Lerch's theorem, forces f=0. So, the conclusion is that only the trivial solution exists.",
