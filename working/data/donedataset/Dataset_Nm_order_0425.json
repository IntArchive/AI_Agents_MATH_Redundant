Hence their sum is the probability of the disjoint union of these events, which is exactly the event that at least one experiment from $1$ to $n$ succeeded. The complementary event corresponds to $n$ failures, hence its probability is the product from $1$ to $n$ of the probabilities of failures $1-p_k$, that is, $$\\prod_{k=1}^n(1-p_k)=\\prod_{k=1}^n\\frac{a_k}{x+a_k}.$$ This proves the claim.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title mentions a proof involving a sum that equals 1/x and relates to ζ(3) and Apéry's proof. The user's question talks about proving an \"amazing\" claim that for all a_1, a_2, ..., the sum from k=1 to infinity of (a_1a_2…a_{k-1}) / [(x+a_1)...(x+a_k)] equals 1/x. Then they mention that this leads to a formula for ζ(3) and note that when a_n=1, the sum works out to 1/x, which is true.\n\nThe example provided in the original problem had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, I need to extract the key assumptions from the problem. The problem states \"for all a_1, a_2, ...\" but the user is questioning if this holds for any \"context-reasonable\" a_n. The example given uses a_n=1, which works, but maybe the assumption is that the sequence a_n is such that the series converges, or perhaps more specific conditions implied by the context of Apéry's proof. However, the problem as stated in the article seems to claim it holds for any a_n, but the user is skeptical and wants to know if it's possible under some reasonable conditions.\n\nWait, the user is asking whether the relation holds for any \"context-reasonable\" a_1, etc., given that the paper gives no info on a_n. The example with a_n=1 works. So maybe the assumption is that the product a_1a_2...a_{k-1} and the denominators (x+a_1)...(x+a_k) are such that the series converges and the equality holds. But the problem as presented in the paper seems to state it's true for all a_1, a_2, ..., which might not be accurate unless there are hidden conditions. So to structure the problem, the assumption would probably be that the equality holds for a specific sequence a_n that's part of Apéry's proof context, but the user is pointing out that the paper doesn't specify. However, the problem as stated in the article is to prove the sum equals 1/x for all a_1, a_2, ..., so maybe the assumption is that the equality holds for any sequence a_n (which might not be true unless there are constraints). Alternatively, the problem might require certain conditions on a_n for the sum to converge and equal 1/x.\n\nBut the example given by the user sets a_n=1, which works. Maybe the key is that the product telescopes or something. Let me think: if a_n is arbitrary, does the sum really always equal 1/x? Let me check with another example. Suppose a_n = n. Then the term for k=1 is (1)/(x+1), for k=2 is (1*2)/[(x+1)(x+2)], etc. Does this sum to 1/x? Probably not. So there must be specific conditions on a_n. The problem as posed in the paper might have a specific sequence a_n in mind, perhaps related to Apéry's work, but the user is pointing out that the paper doesn't specify. Therefore, the actual assumption here is that the equality holds under certain conditions on a_n, which the problem might not state. However, the problem as presented in the paper claims it's true for all a_1,a_2,..., so maybe the formatted problem should take that at face value but note that the user is questioning the missing conditions. But according to the example given in the original formatting, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the original problem's assumption is that the equality holds for all a_1, a_2, ... but the user's example shows a specific case where it works. So perhaps the formatted problem's assumption is that the equality holds for any sequence a_n (though this might not be correct without constraints). Alternatively, the problem might have an implicit assumption, such as x being positive or not equal to any of the -a_i. Wait, looking at the example in the original problem, the user structured the problem by including the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assistant included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, the original problem's example: the user wrote that the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the assistant made a mistake, adding an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user is providing that as an example, so when applying to the current problem, I should follow the user's example structure, even if the example has an error. So in the user's example, the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps the assistant in that example added an extra assumption, maybe a mistake. But regardless, I need to structure the current problem as per the user's example. So for the current problem, the original question states that the paper claims for all a_1,a_2,..., the sum equals 1/x. The user is wondering if this is possible under \"context-reasonable\" a_n. So the formatted problem's assumption would be that the equality holds for all sequences a_1, a_2, ..., but perhaps there's an implicit assumption. Alternatively, the problem as stated in the paper might require certain conditions on a_n, which the user is pointing out. However, the problem as presented in the paper is to prove the equality for all a_1, a_2, ..., so the formatted problem's assumption would be that a_n is any sequence. But the user's example shows that when a_n=1, it works, but perhaps for other sequences, it might not. However, the paper's claim is that it's true for all a_n, which is \"amazing\". The user is confused because the paper doesn't specify a_n. So the formatted problem should capture the problem as stated in the paper, which is to prove the sum equals 1/x for any a_1,a_2,..., so the assumption is that the equality holds for all sequences a_1, a_2, ..., but the problem is to prove that. However, the example given by the user when formatting had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". This suggests that perhaps the assistant in that example mistakenly added an assumption. So perhaps in the current problem, the formatted assumption should list that the series converges, or that x is not a negative of any a_k. Alternatively, maybe the problem's key assumption is that a_1, a_2, ... are positive real numbers, but the original problem doesn't specify. Since the example given by the user in their own problem included assumptions that weren't in the original problem, perhaps I need to infer based on the problem's context. Alternatively, maybe the problem is as stated, with no additional assumptions beyond those given in the problem statement, which is that the equality holds for all a_1,a_2,... So in the formatted problem, the assumption would be that a_1, a_2, ... are any sequences, and the problem is to prove the sum equals 1/x. However, given that the user is pointing out that the paper gives no information on a_n, maybe the key assumption is that the equality holds for any sequence a_n (which might not be true unless certain conditions are met). Alternatively, the problem might have an implicit assumption based on the context of Apéry's proof, but the user isn't sure. So perhaps the formatted problem should list the assumption as \"for any sequence a_1, a_2, ...\" and the problem is to prove the sum equals 1/x. Alternatively, the problem might require that x is a positive real number, but the original problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Looking back at the user's example, they took the original problem's statement which said \"for every integer n\" and in the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps the correct approach is to list all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement as assumptions. The original problem here states \"for all a_1, a_2, ...\", so the assumption would be \"a_1, a_2, ... are any sequences\". But since sequences are infinite, maybe \"a_n is a sequence of real numbers\" or similar. However, the example given by the user when formatting included an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Wait, that example might have been incorrect. Let me check: Original problem says \"for every integer n\", but formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake, but the user provided that as their example. Therefore, maybe the user expects that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", we should list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and possibly add other assumptions if necessary. However, in this case, the current problem states \"for all a_1, a_2, ...\", so the assumptions would be that a_1, a_2, ... are any sequences (maybe of real numbers), and x is such that the denominators are non-zero. But the user's example didn't include assumptions about x. Wait, in the user's example, when a_n=1, the sum becomes a geometric series sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(x+1)^k = 1/x, which converges if |1/(x+1)| < 1, i.e., x > 0 or x < -2. But the equality 1/x holds for x ≠ 0, -1. So maybe there's an implicit assumption that x is such that the series converges. However, in the problem statement, it's claimed that the sum equals 1/x for all a_1,a_2,..., but this can't be true unless specific conditions on a_n and x are met. The user's example works for a_n=1 and x ≠ -1, 0. So perhaps the formatted problem should include assumptions on x and a_n. However, since the original problem as stated in the paper (according to the user) claims it's true for all a_1,a_2,..., the assumptions would be that x is a complex number not equal to any -a_k, and a_n are non-zero or something. But since the user is asking if it's possible under \"context-reasonable\" a_n, maybe the key assumption is that the series converges. So perhaps the formatted problem's assumption would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_1a_2\\cdots a_{k-1}}{(x+a_1)\\cdots(x+a_k)}$ converges,\n$x$ is not equal to $-a_k$ for any $k$,\n$a_1, a_2, \\dots$ are sequences of non-zero real numbers.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't specify these, so maybe the user wants to structure the problem as per the paper's claim, which is that it holds for all a_1,a_2,..., so the assumption is that the equality holds for any sequence a_1,a_2,... and x where the series is defined. But since the user's example included an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps the assistant in that case made an error, but the user expects similar structuring. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is correct, and the original problem had a hidden assumption. Given that confusion, I'll proceed by listing the assumptions as per the problem's statement. The problem states \"for all a_1,a_2,...\", so the assumption is that a_n is any sequence. However, since the problem involves infinite series, convergence is necessary, so that would be an implicit assumption. But the example given by the user didn't include convergence as an assumption, even though when a_n=1, the series converges if |1/(x+1)| < 1. So perhaps the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\n$a_1, a_2, \\dots$ are sequences of real numbers,\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_1a_2\\cdots a_{k-1}}{(x+a_1)\\cdots(x+a_k)}$ converges,\n$x$ is a real number such that $x + a_k \\neq 0$ for all $k \\geq 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_1a_2\\cdots a_{k-1}}{(x+a_1)\\cdots(x+a_k)}=\\frac{1}{x}.$$\n\nBut the original problem as stated in the paper (according to the user) claims it's true for all a_1,a_2,..., so perhaps the assumptions are as given, but the user is pointing out that the paper doesn't specify, so maybe the problem is to prove the equality under the conditions that make it hold, which might require specific assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove it for any a_n without additional constraints, but that seems unlikely. Given the example with a_n=1 works, but other examples might not. Therefore, the actual assumption might be that the product telescopes in a way that the sum collapses to 1/x regardless of a_n. Let me consider the sum:\n\nFor k=1: (a_1a_0...)/( (x+a_1)... ). Wait, the numerator is a_1a_2...a_{k-1}, so for k=1, it's a_1a_2...a_0, which is an empty product (since k-1=0), so the numerator is 1. So the first term is 1/(x+a_1). Then for k=2, it's (a_1)/( (x+a_1)(x+a_2) ). For k=3, (a_1a_2)/( (x+a_1)(x+a_2)(x+a_3) ), etc. So the general term is [product_{i=1}^{k-1} a_i] / [product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i)].\n\nThis can be rewritten as 1/x [1 - product_{i=1}^k x/(x+a_i)], but I'm not sure. Alternatively, telescoping the terms. Let's test with a_n=1. Then each term is 1/(x+1)^k, so the sum is 1/(x+1) + 1/(x+1)^2 + ... = 1/x, as given. So that's a geometric series. But for general a_n, maybe the sum telescopes. Let's suppose that each term can be written as 1/(x+a_1)...(x+a_{k-1}) ) - 1/(x+a_1)...(x+a_k)). For example, if we take the term for k:\n\nLet me see: suppose that [product_{i=1}^{k-1} a_i] / [product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i)] = 1/(x) [1/(x+a_1)...(x+a_{k-1}) - 1/(x+a_1)...(x+a_k))] * a_{k} ? Not sure. Alternatively, telescoping sum where each term cancels out. For example, if the term for k is T_k = C_{k} - C_{k+1}, then the sum telescopes to C_1 - lim_{k→∞} C_{k+1}. If we can write the general term as T_k = D_k - D_{k+1}, then the sum would be D_1 - lim_{k→∞} D_k. For the example when a_n=1, T_k = 1/(x+1)^k, which is D_k = 1/x * 1/(x+1)^{k-1}. So sum_{k=1}^\\infty T_k = 1/x sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(x+1)^{k-1} = 1/x * 1/(1 - 1/(x+1)) ) = 1/x * (x+1)/x ) = (x+1)/x^2. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, when a_n=1, the sum is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(x+1)^k = 1/(x+1) / (1 - 1/(x+1)) ) = 1/(x+1) * (x+1)/x ) = 1/x. Right, so that works. So perhaps for general a_n, the sum telescopes similarly. Let me try to express T_k as a difference. Let’s assume that:\n\nT_k = [product_{i=1}^{k-1} a_i] / [product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i)] = 1/x [1/(product_{i=1}^{k-1} (x+a_i)) - 1/(product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i)) ) ]\n\nIf that's the case, then multiplying both sides by x:\n\nx*T_k = [1/(product_{i=1}^{k-1} (x+a_i)) - 1/(product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i)) ]\n\nThen sum over k from 1 to ∞:\n\nx*sum_{k=1}^\\infty T_k = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [1/(product_{i=1}^{k-1} (x+a_i)) - 1/(product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i)) ]\n\nThis telescopes to:\n\n[1/(product_{i=1}^0 (x+a_i)) - lim_{k→∞} 1/(product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i)) ]\n\nSince product_{i=1}^0 is 1, and assuming that the limit term goes to 0, then x*sum T_k = 1 - 0 =1, so sum T_k=1/x.\n\nTherefore, the key assumption is that the product product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i) grows without bound as k→infty, so that 1/(product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i)) approaches 0. Therefore, the assumptions needed would be:\n\n- For each k ≥1, x + a_k ≠0 (to avoid division by zero),\n- The infinite product product_{i=1}^\\infty (x+a_i) diverges to infinity (so that 1/(product_{i=1}^k (x+a_i)) →0 as k→∞).\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all integers k ≥1, x + a_k ≠ 0,\nThe infinite product $\\prod_{i=1}^\\infty (x + a_i)$ diverges to infinity,\n$a_1, a_2, \\dots$ are sequences of real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_{k-1}}{(x + a_1)(x + a_2) \\cdots (x + a_k)} = \\frac{1}{x}.$$\n\nBut the original problem as stated in the paper (according to the user) claims it's true for all a_1,a_2,..., so these assumptions might be part of the context. However, the user's example with a_n=1 requires that x +1 ≠0 and the product diverges (since (x+1)^k diverges if |x+1|>1, but in their example, it's a geometric series converging when |1/(x+1)| <1, i.e., x>0. Wait, there's a contradiction here. If the product (x+1)^k grows without bound when |x+1|>1, then 1/(x+1)^k →0, but the series sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(x+1)^k converges to 1/x only when |1/(x+1)| <1, which is |x+1|>1. But according to the telescoping argument, if the product diverges, then the sum equals 1/x. However, in the example when a_n=1, the sum equals 1/x even when the product (x+1)^k diverges, which happens when |x+1|>1. But if |x+1|<1, the product (x+1)^k converges to 0, so 1/(product) diverges. But in that case, the series sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(x+1)^k would diverge. So the equality holds when the product diverges (so that the limit term goes to 0), which requires that |x + a_i| >1 for all i or something? Not necessarily. The key is that the infinite product diverges to infinity, so that 1 over product approaches 0. For a_n=1, the product is (x+1)^k, which diverges to infinity if |x+1|>1. But if |x+1|<1, the product approaches 0, so 1/product diverges. But in that case, the series sum would diverge, and the equality 1/x wouldn't hold. Therefore, the equality is valid under the assumption that the infinite product diverges, ensuring the telescoping sum converges to 1/x. So the necessary assumptions are that x + a_k ≠0 for all k, and the product diverges. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should include these.",
