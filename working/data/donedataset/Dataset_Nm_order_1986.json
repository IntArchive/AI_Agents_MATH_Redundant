    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you have already proved the relevant result about the limit of a sum, or difference, it is OK. But the result about uniqueness of limits that you are trying to prove comes typically quite early, immediately after the definition. So we give a fairly detailed proof. Suppose to the contrary that $L\\ne M$. Let $\\epsilon=\\frac{|L-M|}{10}$. There is an $N_1$ such that if $n\\gt N_1$ then $|a_n-L|\\lt \\epsilon$. There is an $N_2$ such that if $n\\gt N_2$ then $|a_n-M|\\lt \\epsilon$. Let $N=\\max(N_1,N_2)$. If $n\\gt N$ then $|a_n-L|\\lt \\epsilon$ and $|a_n-M|\\lt \\epsilon$. But then by the Triangle inequality $|L-M|\\le |a_n-L|+|M-a_n|\\lt \\frac{2}{10}|L-M|$. This is impossible. Hence the assumption $L\\ne M$ is false and  $L=M$. Remark: The basic intuition is pretty simple. After a while $a_n$ is very close to $L$. After a while it is very close to $M$. That's not possible. The $\\epsilon$ stuff made  this geometric intuition arithmetical.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that a convergent sequence has a unique limit. The user is asking if their method is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that {a_n} is a convergent sequence. The user then assumes two limits, L and M, and shows that L - M = 0, hence L = M. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In this case, the main assumption is that the sequence {a_n} is convergent. However, in the user's approach, they also assume that the limit is both L and M. So, maybe the assumptions here are that the sequence converges to L and to M. But since convergence to a limit implies uniqueness, perhaps the key is that the user is assuming convergence to two different limits. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's about proving uniqueness, so maybe the assumptions need to be laid out as the convergence to two limits, and then the problem is to show those limits are equal.\n\nWait, in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the problem, it was restructured to list those as assumptions. Similarly, here, the problem is about proving that if a sequence converges to L and M, then L = M. So the assumptions would be that the sequence converges to L and converges to M. The problem is to show that L must equal M.\n\nBut in the user's question, they present their method as: Assume lim a_n = L and lim a_n = M, then L - M = lim a_n - lim a_n = L - L = 0, so L = M. The user is asking if this method is wrong. So perhaps the actual problem here is to determine whether this proof is valid.\n\nBut according to the original task, the goal is to structure the problem as per the given format. The example took the original problem, filtered out unrelated information, and listed assumptions and the problem. Here, the original problem is \"Proving that a convergent sequence has a unique limit\" and the user presents their method. So the key problem is the user's question: Is the method correct? But the way the example was structured, the problem became \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with certain assumptions. Here, perhaps the problem is to determine if the method is correct, but maybe the original problem is to prove the uniqueness of the limit. The user's approach is presented as a proof, and the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nBut perhaps the structured problem needs to be as per the original intent. The original problem is the standard one: prove a convergent sequence has a unique limit. The user's method is their approach. However, when structuring the problem, perhaps we need to present the problem as \"Prove that a convergent sequence has a unique limit\" and list assumptions. The assumptions would be that {a_n} is a convergent sequence, and that it has limits L and M. So the problem is to show L = M.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be that {a_n} converges to L and converges to M. But wait, in reality, the convergence to L and M is not an assumption but part of the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is structured as: Given that {a_n} is a convergent sequence, prove that its limit is unique. So the assumption is that the sequence converges. Then the problem is to prove uniqueness.\n\nAlternatively, since in the user's proof, they start by assuming two limits, the assumptions would be that the sequence converges to L and converges to M. The problem is then to show L = M.\n\nSo following the example, the assumptions should be each on separate lines. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n{a_n} is a convergent sequence,\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = L,\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that L = M.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user is asking if their method is wrong. But when structuring the problem as per the example, the user's question is transformed into the problem. However, the example took the original problem's content and structured it. So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that a convergent sequence has a unique limit,\" with the assumptions being that the sequence is convergent. However, the user's approach assumes two limits and subtracts them, leading to L = M. But according to standard proofs, this approach might be too simplistic because it assumes the linearity of limits without justification, especially when dealing with two different limits. So maybe the problem as posed by the user is incomplete because they didn't properly justify that the difference of the limits is the limit of the differences, which requires that both limits exist, but since they are the same sequence, this might be conflating things.\n\nBut perhaps the structured problem should be as per the original problem's intent, which is to prove uniqueness of the limit, with the assumption that the sequence converges. But the user's approach is part of the question, not part of the problem. Therefore, the actual problem to structure is \"Prove that a convergent sequence has a unique limit,\" with the assumption that {a_n} is a convergent sequence. Then the problem is to show that the limit is unique.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about their method. However, the task is to structure the problem, not the question about the method's correctness. Therefore, the problem is \"Prove that a convergent sequence has a unique limit,\" and the assumptions are that {a_n} is a convergent sequence. However, in the user's presented problem, they have written the proof attempt, which assumes two limits and subtracts them. But when structuring the problem, we need to present the problem itself, not the user's solution attempt. So the original problem is to prove that a convergent sequence has a unique limit, and the assumptions are that the sequence converges. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n{a_n} is a convergent sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that {a_n} has a unique limit.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were more specific, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the main assumption is that the sequence converges. But in the user's proof attempt, they are assuming two limits. So perhaps to structure the problem as the user's question, which is whether their method is wrong. Wait, but the task says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The user's question is \"Is the following method wrong?\" with their proof attempt. But the format requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". So perhaps the problem here is to verify the correctness of the method, with the assumptions being that the sequence converges to L and M. Then the problem is to determine if L = M based on that method. Alternatively, the problem is as presented in the title: \"Proving that a convergent sequence has a unique limit,\" and the user's method is their attempt. But the structured problem should be the original problem, not the user's question about their method. The example given took the original problem and structured it, ignoring the user's particular solution. So perhaps here, the original problem is to prove that a convergent sequence has a unique limit, and the assumptions are that {a_n} is convergent. Therefore, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\n{a_n} is a convergent sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that {a_n} has a unique limit.\n\nBut the user's attempt involves assuming two limits and subtracting, which might not be the standard approach. The standard proof usually uses the epsilon definition to show that the difference between L and M is less than any epsilon, hence zero. But the user's approach seems to use the linearity of limits, which is valid if both L and M are limits of the same sequence. However, the step where they write lim a_n - lim a_n = L - L = 0 might be circular, because they are assuming both limits are equal by treating them as the same limit. Wait, no. They say lim a_n = L and lim a_n = M, then subtract them to get L - M = 0. But technically, the limits are properties of the sequence; if the sequence converges, the limit is unique, so assuming it converges to both L and M is part of the proof by contradiction or directly. The user's method is taking the difference of the limits as the limit of the differences, but since the sequence terms are the same, the difference would be zero. However, this might be an oversimplification. The correct approach is to consider that if the limit is L, then for any epsilon, the terms are within epsilon of L, and similarly for M, leading to |L - M| < 2 epsilon, hence L = M. The user's method may be seen as correct if we accept that algebraic operations on limits hold even when dealing with hypothetical different limits. But usually, limit laws are applied when you have two sequences converging to L and M respectively, then their difference converges to L - M. But in this case, it's the same sequence, so subtracting the two limits is not standard. Therefore, the user's approach might be flawed because they are treating L and M as two separate limits of the same sequence and applying limit laws incorrectly. Therefore, the problem is to determine if this method is valid. However, the task is to structure the problem, not the user's question about their method. So I need to focus on the original problem presented in the title: \"Proving that a convergent sequence has a unique limit.\" Therefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n{a_n} is a convergent sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that {a_n} has a unique limit.\n\nBut the user's question includes their attempted proof. However, the example provided in the original query structured the problem by extracting the mathematical content from the user's question, filtering out unrelated information. In the example, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions and restated the problem. Similarly, here, the user's problem is about proving uniqueness of the limit, and their attempt is part of the question. But the formatted problem should just be the problem itself. So the assumptions are that {a_n} converges, and the problem is to prove uniqueness. Alternatively, if considering the user's approach, perhaps the assumptions include that the sequence converges to both L and M, and the problem is to show L = M. So:\n\nAssumption:\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = L,\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that L = M.\n\nBut this might be more aligned with the user's approach. However, in standard terms, the problem is to show that if a sequence converges to L and M, then L = M. Therefore, the assumptions would be the two limits, and the problem is to show they're equal. In that case, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = L,\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that L = M.\n\nBut the user's question is whether their method is wrong, and the method is exactly this approach. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which in the example took the problem statement and listed assumptions and problem. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n{a_n} is a convergent sequence,\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = L,\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that L = M.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Each assumption is one line, one property applied to one object. So here, the assumptions are that {a_n} converges, and that it has two limits L and M. Wait, but usually, the convergence to a limit is unique by definition. However, the problem is to prove that, so the actual assumptions would be that {a_n} converges to L and converges to M. The problem is to show L = M.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first assumption is that {a_n} is a convergent sequence, which inherently has at least one limit. Then, assuming it has two limits L and M, prove they're equal. But the problem is to show uniqueness given convergence. Therefore, the correct structuring would be:\n\nAssumption:\n{a_n} is a convergent sequence,\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = L,\nlim_{n→∞} a_n = M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that L = M.\n\nEach assumption is on a separate line. The first line states the sequence is convergent. The next two lines state that it converges to L and M, which are two limits. The problem is to show they are equal. This matches the structure of the example, where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So this seems correct.",
