    "Content": "Assume strictly monotone increasing function;\n   such that $f:N^{+}\\to N^{+}$ , $h$ for all $n\\in N^{+}$ , $$f(f(f(n)))=f(f(n))\\cdot f(n)\\cdot n^{2015}$$ Prove or disprove: $f(n)=n^{13}$ Put $n=1,f(1)=m$ $$f(f(m))=mf(m)$$ Put $n=m$ , $$f(f(f(m)))=f(f(m))f(m)m^{2015}\\Longrightarrow f(mf(m))=m^{2016}(f(m))^2$$ What about following?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let us denote by $f^{[k]}(n)$ the $k$th iterate of $f$. I cannot prove the claim, but I can prove that for all integers $n>1$ we have\n$$\n\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\log f^{[k+1]}(n)}{\\log f^{[k]}(n)}=13.\n$$\nThis is some kind of asymptotic evidence in favor of $f(n)=n^{13}$ being the only solution - alas, anything but conclusive. This is seen as follows. We first prove that for all $k\\ge3$ we have\n$$\nf^{[k]}(n)=f^{[2]}(n)^{A_k} f(n)^{B_k} n^{C_k}\\qquad(*)\n$$\nfor the sequence of vectors of positive integer determined by the recurrence relations\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{r}\nA_2\\\\B_2\\\\C_2\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{r}\n1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{array}\\right),\\qquad\n\\left(\\begin{array}{r}\nA_{k+1}\\\\B_{k+1}\\\\C_{k+1}\\end{array}\\right)=M\\left(\\begin{array}{r}\nA_k\\\\B_k\\\\C_k\\end{array}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the $3\\times3$ matrix\n$$\nM=\\left(\\begin{array}{crr}\n1&1&0\\\\1&0&1\\\\2015&0&0\\end{array}\\right).\n$$\nThe proof follows from the given functional equation of $f$ by induction on $k$. The case $k=3$ is exactly the functional equation. The inductive step follows from the induction hypothesis by substituting $f(n)$ in place of $n$ and again applying the given functional equation. The eigenvalues of $M$ are $\\lambda_1=13$ and $\\lambda_{2,3}=-6+i\\sqrt{119}$.\nThe key is that of these $\\lambda_1$ has the largest absolute value. Furthermore, if we write the vector \n$$\n(A_2,B_2,C_2)^T=x_1e_1+x_2e_2+x_3e_3\n$$\nin terms of unit eigenvectors $e_1,e_2,e_3$ belonging to the respective eigenvalues, we see that $x_1\\neq0$. For any $k\\ge3$ we then have\n$$\n(A_k,B_k,C_k)^T=\\lambda_1^{k-2}x_1e_1+\\lambda_2^{k-2}x_2e_2+\\lambda_3^{k-2}x_3e_3.\n$$\nFor very large values of $k$ the first component dominates, and consequently\n$$\n\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac{A_{k+1}}{A_k}=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac{B_{k+1}}{B_k}=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac{C_{k+1}}{C_k}=13.\n$$\nIt takes a while to see these limits if you calculate them. For some numerical support I fired up my Mathematica. The entrywise ratios of $M^{129}$ and $M^{128}$ are all in the interval $(12.9,13.2)$. The claim follows from this by taking logarithms from $(*)$. I don't know if this helps. It does seem to me that we should concentrate on large values of $n$ and asymptotics first. If only we could prove that $f$ must be a homomorphism of multiplicative monoids. Then it being strictly increasing would force it to a power function, and we know the exponent. If we know that $f$ is a power function the exponent can be determined without resorting to the above asymptotic gymnastics.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. Let's start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Is it true that this function $f(n)=n^{13}$?\" Then the question states:\n\n- Assume strictly monotone increasing function; such that $f: \\mathbb{N}^{+} \\to \\mathbb{N}^{+}$, for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}^{+}$, \n  $$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) \\cdot f(n) \\cdot n^{2015}$$\n  Prove or disprove: $f(n) = n^{13}$.\n\nThe user then provides some steps they've tried, like putting $n=1$ and $n=m$, leading to some equations. But for structuring the problem, we need to focus only on the problem statement and its assumptions, filtering out the attempted solutions.\n\nFirst, identify all assumptions. The problem states:\n\n1. $f$ is a strictly monotone increasing function. That's one assumption about the property of $f$.\n2. The domain and codomain of $f$ are $\\mathbb{N}^{+}$ (positive integers). So, $f: \\mathbb{N}^{+} \\to \\mathbb{N}^{+}$.\n3. For all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}^{+}$, the functional equation holds: $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) \\cdot f(n) \\cdot n^{2015}$.\n\nThe problem is to prove or disprove that $f(n) = n^{13}$.\n\nNow, check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention divisibility by 7 or anything like the example. The user in their attempt considered putting $n=1$ and $n=m$, but those are part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- $f$ is strictly monotone increasing.\n- $f$ maps positive integers to positive integers.\n- For every positive integer $n$, the given functional equation holds.\n\nThe problem is to prove or disprove that $f(n) = n^{13}$.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's check:\n\n1. $f$ is a strictly monotone increasing function. (This is a single property of $f$)\n2. $f$ is defined from $\\mathbb{N}^{+}$ to $\\mathbb{N}^{+}$. (Domain and codomain)\n3. For all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}^{+}$, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) \\cdot f(n) \\cdot n^{2015}$. (Functional equation)\n\nThese are three separate assumptions. Now, structure the problem accordingly.",
