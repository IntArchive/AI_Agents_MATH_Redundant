    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, we have a sequence defined by x₁ being between 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is x_{n+1} = xₙ + (xₙ²)/n². The goal is to prove that this sequence has a limit, meaning it converges. The user already mentioned that it's easy to show the sequence is increasing, but they're stuck on proving it's bounded. Let me start by verifying the increasing part.\n\nSince x₁ is between 0 and 1, and each term adds a positive quantity (because xₙ²/n² is always positive as long as xₙ is positive), the sequence is indeed increasing. So, if it's increasing, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, if we can show it's bounded above, then it must converge. The key is to find an upper bound.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. Maybe induction? Suppose we assume that xₙ is bounded by some value for all n, but I need a specific bound. Alternatively, maybe we can relate the sequence to a known convergent series. Since each term adds xₙ²/n², perhaps we can compare the sum of xₙ²/n² to a convergent series.\n\nWait, if the sequence xₙ converges, then for large n, x_{n+1} - xₙ = xₙ²/n² would be small, which suggests that the series sum of xₙ²/n² converges. But how does that help us?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can bound xₙ in terms of n. Let me try to find an upper bound. Suppose xₙ ≤ C for some constant C. Then x_{n+1} = xₙ + xₙ²/n² ≤ C + C²/n². But summing C²/n² over all n converges because the series sum 1/n² converges. However, this might not directly give a fixed upper bound unless we can telescope the terms.\n\nAnother approach: let's write out the recursive relation and try to telescope. Maybe consider 1/xₙ. Let me see:\n\nIf we take reciprocals, maybe we can find a telescoping series. Let's define yₙ = 1/xₙ. Then:\n\ny_{n+1} = 1/x_{n+1} = 1/(xₙ + xₙ²/n²) = 1/(xₙ(1 + xₙ/n²)) = (1/xₙ) * 1/(1 + xₙ/n²) ≈ yₙ (1 - xₙ/n²) for small xₙ/n². But not sure if this approximation helps.\n\nAlternatively, use the inequality 1/(1 + a) ≥ 1 - a for a > 0. So:\n\ny_{n+1} = 1/(xₙ(1 + xₙ/n²)) = (1/xₙ) * 1/(1 + xₙ/n²) ≥ (1/xₙ)(1 - xₙ/n²) = yₙ - 1/n².\n\nBut then y_{n+1} ≥ yₙ - 1/n². Summing from n=1 to N, we get y_{N+1} ≥ y₁ - Σ_{n=1}^N 1/n². Since Σ1/n² converges to π²/6, we have y_{N+1} ≥ y₁ - π²/6. But since y₁ = 1/x₁ > 1 (because 0 < x₁ <1), then y_{N+1} is bounded below by some positive number, which would imply x_{N+1} ≤ 1/(y₁ - π²/6). Wait, but this requires that y₁ - π²/6 > 0, i.e., 1/x₁ > π²/6. But x₁ is less than 1, so 1/x₁ >1, and π²/6 ≈ 1.6449, so unless x₁ is greater than 6/π² ≈ 0.6079, this would not hold. But x₁ can be as small as approaching 0, so this approach might not work for all x₁ in (0,1). Hmm, maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nLet me try another approach. Since the sequence is increasing and we need to show it's bounded above. Suppose we can show that xₙ ≤ C for all n, where C is some constant. Let's assume that xₙ ≤ 2, for example. Then x_{n+1} = xₙ + xₙ²/n² ≤ 2 + 4/n². Summing up from n=1 to infinity, the total added would be finite since Σ4/n² converges, but this doesn't immediately give a fixed upper bound. Wait, actually, if we start with x₁ <1, and add up terms like 4/n², the total possible limit would be x₁ + Σ_{n=1}^∞ 4/n², which is 4*(π²/6) ≈ 6.5797, so maybe xₙ is bounded above by something like 1 + 4*(π²/6). But this is a rough estimate. However, this line of reasoning isn't rigorous because we assumed xₙ ≤2 to get x_{n+1} ≤2 +4/n², but to bound xₙ, we need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider using mathematical induction. Suppose we can show that xₙ ≤ some function of n that converges. For example, maybe xₙ ≤ C - sum_{k=n}^\\infty 1/k² or something. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, here's a thought. Let's consider the recursion x_{n+1} - xₙ = xₙ² /n². Summing from n=1 to N, we get x_{N+1} -x₁ = Σ_{n=1}^N xₙ² /n². If we can show that this sum converges as N approaches infinity, then xₙ would converge. So the problem reduces to showing that Σ xₙ² /n² converges. But how to show that?\n\nBut since xₙ is increasing, xₙ² is also increasing. So the terms xₙ² /n² are increasing? Wait, no. The denominator is n², which grows, so even if xₙ² is increasing, the term xₙ² /n² might not necessarily be increasing. For example, if xₙ grows slower than n, then xₙ² /n² could decrease.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compare the series Σ xₙ² /n² with a convergent series. Suppose xₙ is bounded by some constant M. Then xₙ² /n² ≤ M² /n², and since Σ M² /n² converges, then Σ xₙ² /n² converges as well. Therefore, if we can show xₙ is bounded, then the series converges, hence x_{n} converges. But wait, this seems circular. Because we need to show that xₙ is bounded to show that the series converges, but the convergence of the series would imply that xₙ converges. So maybe the approach is to show that xₙ is bounded, which would then imply the series converges, hence xₙ converges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a more direct bound. Let me consider that x_{n+1} = xₙ + xₙ² /n². Let's try to bound xₙ. Suppose we can find a sequence aₙ such that xₙ ≤ aₙ, and aₙ is convergent. Let's try to find such a sequence.\n\nMaybe compare it to a telescoping series. Let me consider the function f(x) = -1/(x + c), where c is some constant. Then, the difference f(x_{n+1}) - f(xₙ) might telescope. Wait, maybe integrating or using differential equations.\n\nAlternatively, consider the differential equation analog. If we model x_{n+1} - xₙ ≈ dx/dn = x² /n². Then, this is a differential equation: dx/dn = x² /n². Solving this, we can separate variables: dx/x² = dn/n². Integrating both sides: -1/x = -1/n + C. Therefore, 1/x = 1/n + C, so x = 1/(C + 1/n). As n approaches infinity, x approaches 1/C. So this suggests that the solution might tend to a finite limit. But this is a continuous approximation; the actual discrete sequence might behave similarly. This gives a hint that the limit exists.\n\nBut how to make this rigorous? Maybe use the idea that the sequence is bounded and increasing. Let's try to find an upper bound.\n\nSuppose we use induction to show that xₙ ≤ K for some K. Let's assume that xₙ ≤ K. Then x_{n+1} = xₙ + xₙ² /n² ≤ K + K² /n². To ensure that x_{n+1} ≤ K, we need K + K² /n² ≤ K. But that would require K² /n² ≤0, which isn't possible unless K=0, which contradicts x₁ >0. So induction in this simple form doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a decreasing sequence for the upper bound. Let's suppose that xₙ ≤ K - sum_{k=1}^{n-1} something. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since x_{n+1} = xₙ(1 + xₙ/n²). Let's take logarithms. Let ln(x_{n+1}) = ln(xₙ) + ln(1 + xₙ/n²). Then sum over n:\n\nln(x_{N+1}) = ln(x₁) + Σ_{n=1}^N ln(1 + xₙ/n²).\n\nIf we can show that this sum converges, then ln(x_{N+1}) converges, hence x_{N+1} converges. But again, how to bound Σ ln(1 + xₙ/n²). Since ln(1 + t) ≤ t for t >0, we have Σ ln(1 + xₙ/n²) ≤ Σ xₙ/n². So if Σ xₙ/n² converges, then the sum converges. But again, this requires that xₙ is bounded, because if xₙ ≤ M, then Σ M/n² converges. So again, circular.\n\nWait, but maybe we can use a bootstrapping argument. Suppose we don't know if xₙ is bounded, but we can try to estimate its growth.\n\nSuppose xₙ ≤ n for all n. Then x_{n+1} = xₙ + xₙ²/n² ≤ xₙ + n²/n² = xₙ +1. Then xₙ ≤ x₁ + (n-1). But this gives xₙ ≤ x₁ +n-1, which is linear growth. But this is too crude, and the actual recursion may grow slower.\n\nAlternatively, suppose xₙ ≤ C n^α for some α <1. Then x_{n+1} ≤ C n^α + C² n^{2α}/n² = C n^α + C² n^{2α -2}. If we can choose α such that 2α -2 ≤ α -1, which simplifies to α ≤1. For example, if α=1, then 2α -2=0, so term is C². Then x_{n+1} ≤ C n + C². But this would lead to linear growth again. If α <1, then 2α -2 < α -1, so the second term is of lower order. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the inequality x_{n+1} -xₙ = xₙ² /n² ≤ xₙ x_{n}/n². If xₙ is increasing, then xₙ ≤ x_{n+1}, so x_{n+1} -xₙ ≤ x_{n+1}² /n². But this seems not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think about the series Σ (x_{n+1} - xₙ) = Σ xₙ² /n². If we can bound this series, then xₙ is Cauchy, hence converges. But to bound the series, we need to show that Σ xₙ² /n² < ∞. Since xₙ is increasing, xₙ² is increasing, so xₙ² /n² ≤ x_{n+1}² /n². Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, compare with a telescoping series. Let me consider the function f(x) = 1/x. Then, f(x_{n}) - f(x_{n+1}) = 1/xₙ -1/x_{n+1} = (x_{n+1} -xₙ)/(xₙ x_{n+1}) ). From the recursion, x_{n+1} -xₙ = xₙ² /n². Therefore, 1/xₙ -1/x_{n+1} = (xₙ² /n²)/(xₙ x_{n+1}) ) = xₙ / (n² x_{n+1}) ). But x_{n+1} = xₙ + xₙ² /n² ≥ xₙ, so x_{n+1} ≥ xₙ. Thus, xₙ /x_{n+1} ≤1. Therefore, 1/xₙ -1/x_{n+1} ≤ 1/n². Summing from n=1 to N, we get 1/x₁ -1/x_{N+1} ≤ Σ_{n=1}^N 1/n² < π²/6. Therefore, 1/x_{N+1} ≥1/x₁ - π²/6. Hence, x_{N+1} ≤ 1/(1/x₁ - π²/6). But this requires that 1/x₁ - π²/6 >0, i.e., x₁ <6/(π²)≈0.6079. However, the problem states that x₁ is in (0,1). So for x₁ <6/π², this gives an upper bound, but for x₁ ≥6/π², the denominator would be non-positive, which doesn't give a useful bound. Therefore, this approach only works for x₁ <6/π². But the problem states x₁ is in (0,1), so we need a method that works for all x₁ in (0,1).\n\nHmm, so this approach only partially works. Maybe we need another idea for x₁ ≥6/π². Alternatively, perhaps the sequence converges regardless of the initial value in (0,1).\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Suppose we consider the infinite product. Since x_{n+1} =xₙ (1 +xₙ /n²). Then, recursively, x_{n+1} =x₁ ∏_{k=1}^n (1 +x_k /k²). Taking logarithms, ln x_{n+1} = ln x₁ + Σ_{k=1}^n ln(1 +x_k/k²). If we can show this sum converges, then x_{n} converges. But again, similar to before, ln(1 +x_k/k²) ~x_k/k² for large k. So if Σ x_k/k² converges, then the product converges. But again, this requires x_k is bounded.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that xₙ is increasing and bounded above. Let's assume that xₙ approaches L. Then, taking limits on both sides, L = L + L² *0, which is trivial. So that doesn't help directly. Wait, but if the limit exists, say L, then the difference x_{n+1} -xₙ =xₙ² /n² →0 as n→infty. But this is a necessary condition, not sufficient.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's suppose that the sequence xₙ is bounded above by some M. Then, since it's increasing, it must converge to M. To show that such M exists, we need to show that xₙ doesn't go to infinity. Suppose, for contradiction, that xₙ→∞. Then, for sufficiently large n, xₙ is large, so x_{n+1} ≈xₙ +xₙ² /n². But the sum Σxₙ² /n² would need to diverge for xₙ to go to infinity. However, if xₙ grows faster than n, then xₙ² /n² would grow, making the series diverge. But if xₙ grows slower than n, say xₙ ~n^α for some α<1, then xₙ² /n² ~n^{2α-2}, and Σn^{2α-2} converges if 2α-2 < -1, i.e., α <0.5. But if α=0.5, then Σn^{-1} diverges. So if xₙ ~sqrt(n), the series diverges, leading xₙ to infinity. But if xₙ grows slower than sqrt(n), the series converges, so xₙ converges.\n\nBut how do we know which case we're in? The recursion is x_{n+1} =xₙ +xₙ² /n². If xₙ ~sqrt(n), then x_{n+1} -xₙ ~ (sqrt(n))² /n² =1/n, so the increment is ~1/n, and summing 1/n diverges, which would mean xₙ ~sum 1/n ~log n, contradicting the assumption xₙ ~sqrt(n). This suggests that the growth rate is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume xₙ ~C n^α. Then plug into the recursion:\n\nC (n+1)^α ≈C n^α + C² n^{2α}/n² =C n^α +C² n^{2α -2}.\n\nFor large n, the left-hand side is approximately C n^α (1 + α/(n)). So:\n\nC n^α (1 + α/n) ≈ C n^α + C² n^{2α -2}.\n\nSubtract C n^α from both sides:\n\nC n^α (α/n) ≈ C² n^{2α -2}\n\nSimplify:\n\nC α n^{α -1} ≈ C² n^{2α -2}\n\nDivide both sides by C n^{α -1}:\n\nα ≈ C n^{α -1}\n\nFor this to hold as n→infty, the RHS must tend to a constant or zero. So we need α -1=0, i.e., α=1, but then RHS is C, which would require α=C. So α=C and α=1, so C=1. But then LHS is 1, RHS is 1* n^{1-1}=1. Wait, this suggests that xₙ ~n is a possible leading term. But if xₙ ~n, then x_{n+1} -xₙ ~n² /n² =1, which matches the LHS increment of ~1. But if xₙ ~n, then sum xₙ² /n² ~sum n² /n²=sum 1, which diverges, meaning xₙ would go to infinity. But this contradicts the idea that the sequence might converge. So this suggests that if xₙ grows linearly, then indeed the series diverges and xₙ→∞. However, if xₙ grows slower, say xₙ ~log n, then x_{n+1} -xₙ ~ (log n)^2 /n², which is summable, so xₙ converges. But how do we know which is the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the comparison test. Suppose we can show that xₙ ≤ K log n for some K. Then, x_{n+1} =xₙ +xₙ² /n² ≤K log n + K² (log n)^2 /n². The sum Σ (log n)^2 /n² converges, so xₙ would be bounded by K log n plus a convergent series, which would be O(log n). But this still allows xₙ to grow to infinity, albeit slowly.\n\nWait, but we need to show that xₙ is bounded. Let's think back to the original problem. The user says they can't prove it's bounded. Perhaps there's a smarter way to bound it.\n\nAnother idea: use induction with a cleverly chosen bound. Suppose we can show that xₙ ≤ 1/(1 - x₁ (1 -1/n)) or something similar. Not sure.\n\nWait, here's an approach I recall from similar problems. Let's consider the series sum_{k=1}^\\infty x_k^2 /k^2. If we can show this series converges, then the sequence xₙ converges. But to show convergence of the series, since xₙ is increasing, x_k ≥x₁, so x_k^2 /k² ≥x₁² /k², but we know sum 1/k² converges, so comparison test doesn't help. However, if xₙ is bounded, then x_k^2 /k² ≤M² /k², and the series converges. But again, this requires xₙ is bounded, which is what we need to prove.\n\nWait, maybe use a recursive bound. Let's define S_n = sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2 /k². Then, x_{n+1} =x₁ + S_n. If we can show that S_n converges, then xₙ converges. So we need to show S_n is bounded above. But S_n is increasing, so we need to show it's bounded.\n\nBut how? Let's try to bound xₙ. Since xₙ is increasing, xₙ ≥x₁. So S_n ≥x₁² sum_{k=1}^n 1/k². But sum 1/k² converges, so S_n converges iff xₙ is bounded. Again circular.\n\nWait, perhaps use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the inequality (x_{n+1} -xₙ) =xₙ² /n² ≤xₙ x_{n}/n². Since xₙ is increasing, xₙ ≤x_{n+1}, so x_{n+1} -xₙ ≤x_{n+1}² /n². Rearranging, x_{n+1} -xₙ ≤x_{n+1}² /n². Let me denote aₙ =xₙ. Then, a_{n+1} -aₙ ≤a_{n+1}² /n². This is a recurrence inequality. Maybe solving this would give a bound on aₙ.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio a_{n+1}/aₙ =1 +aₙ /n². Taking logarithms: ln(a_{n+1}/aₙ) =ln(1 +aₙ /n²) ≤aₙ /n². Summing over n, we get ln(a_{N}/a₁) ≤sum_{n=1}^{N-1} aₙ /n². If we can bound this sum, then a_N ≤a₁ exp(sum aₙ /n²). But again, this requires knowing something about sum aₙ /n².\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Let's try to look for a different approach. The problem is similar to recursive sequences where each term is defined by adding a term involving the previous term squared divided by n squared. Maybe look for a contraction mapping or something.\n\nWait, here's a different idea. Since 0 <x₁ <1, and xₙ is increasing, let's try to show that xₙ is bounded above by 1/(1 -x₁). Wait, if x₁=0.5, then 1/(1 -0.5)=2. But does the sequence stay below 2?\n\nLet's test with x₁=0.5. Compute x₂=0.5 +0.25/1=0.75. x₃=0.75 +0.75²/4=0.75 +0.5625/4≈0.75+0.140625≈0.890625. x₄=0.890625 + (0.890625)^2/9≈0.890625 +0.793/9≈0.890625+0.088≈0.9786. x₅≈0.9786 + (0.9786)^2/16≈0.9786 +0.957/16≈0.9786+0.0598≈1.0384. x₆≈1.0384 + (1.0384)^2/25≈1.0384 +1.0783/25≈1.0384+0.0431≈1.0815. x₇≈1.0815 + (1.0815)^2/36≈1.0815 +1.1697/36≈1.0815+0.0325≈1.114. Continuing this, it seems like xₙ is increasing but the increments are getting smaller. Maybe it converges to a limit.\n\nBut this is just a numerical example. Need a general proof.\n\nAnother idea: note that for n ≥N, xₙ ≥x_N, so x_{n+1} =xₙ +xₙ² /n² ≥xₙ +x_N² /n². Summing from n=N to infinity, the increment would be at least x_N² Σ_{n=N}^∞ 1/n². But Σ_{n=N}^∞ 1/n² ~1/N. So the total increment would be approximately x_N² /N. If x_N is large, say x_N ~N, then the increment would be ~N² /N =N, which is large, but this contradicts the assumption that xₙ is large. However, this is heuristic.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume xₙ is unbounded, then for any large M, there exists N such that x_N ≥M. Then x_{N+1} =x_N +x_N² /N² ≥M +M² /N². If we choose M=2N², then x_{N+1} ≥2N² + (4N^4)/N²=2N² +4N²=6N². But this leads to even faster growth. But this assumes x_N can reach 2N², which might not be possible.\n\nWait, but if xₙ is unbounded, then for any K, there exists N such that x_N ≥K. Then, x_{N+1} ≥K +K² /N². If K is chosen such that K² /N² ≥1, say K ≥N, then x_{N+1} ≥K +1 ≥N +1. So, inductively, if x_N ≥N, then x_{N+1} ≥N +1. This suggests that if xₙ ever exceeds n, then it will grow at least linearly thereafter. But we start with x₁ <1, so initially, xₙ <1 + previous terms. Let's see:\n\nSuppose x₁=0.5, then x₂=0.75, x₃≈0.8906, x₄≈0.9786, x₅≈1.0384, x₆≈1.0815, x₇≈1.114, x₈≈1.114 + (1.114)^2/49≈1.114 +1.241/49≈1.114+0.0253≈1.1393. x₉≈1.1393 + (1.1393)^2/64≈1.1393 +1.298/64≈1.1393+0.0203≈1.1596. x_{10}≈1.1596 + (1.1596)^2/100≈1.1596 +1.3446/100≈1.1596+0.0134≈1.173. Continuing this, the increments get smaller each time. It seems like the sequence is converging to around 1.3 or so in this case. This suggests that even if xₙ surpasses 1, it doesn't explode but instead converges.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Maybe consider that after some n, the increments xₙ² /n² become small enough that the series Σxₙ² /n² converges, hence xₙ converges.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that xₙ is Cauchy. For m >n,\n\n|x_m -x_n| =Σ_{k=n}^{m-1} x_k² /k².\n\nIf we can show that this sum can be made arbitrarily small for large n, then the sequence is Cauchy. To do this, since xₙ is increasing, x_k ≤x_m for n ≤k ≤m. So,\n\nΣ_{k=n}^{m-1} x_k² /k² ≤x_m² Σ_{k=n}^{m-1} 1/k².\n\nBut Σ_{k=n}^\\infty 1/k² ≤1/(n-1). So if x_m is bounded, then Σ_{k=n}^\\infty x_k² /k² ≤M²/(n-1), which tends to 0 as n→infty. Hence, the sequence is Cauchy and converges. But this requires that xₙ is bounded, which is what we need to prove.\n\nThis seems like another circular argument. Wait, but if we assume that xₙ is unbounded, then x_m can be made arbitrarily large, so the bound Σ_{k=n}^\\infty x_k² /k² ≤x_m²/(n-1) doesn't help. But if xₙ is bounded, then this works. So we need to show xₙ is bounded.\n\nWait, here's a different approach inspired by the integral test. Consider the function f(n) =xₙ. The recursion is f(n+1) =f(n) +f(n)^2 /n². We can compare this to the integral equation f'(n) =f(n)^2 /n². The solution to the differential equation is f(n)=1/(C -1/n), but let's check:\n\ndf/dn =f² /n² ⇒ ∫ df/f² =∫ dn/n² ⇒ -1/f = -1/n +C ⇒ f=1/(1/n +C). As n→infty, f→1/C. So the solution tends to a finite limit if we start with initial condition f(1)=x₁. Let's solve for C:\n\nAt n=1, f(1)=1/(1/1 +C)=1/(1 +C)=x₁ ⇒C=1/x₁ -1. Thus, the solution tends to 1/C=1/(1/x₁ -1)=x₁/(1 -x₁). This suggests that the limit should be x₁/(1 -x₁), but wait, this is the solution to the differential equation, but our sequence is discrete. However, it gives a hint that the limit might be related to x₁/(1 -x₁). For example, if x₁=0.5, the limit would be 1. But in the numerical example earlier, with x₁=0.5, the sequence seemed to approach around 1.3. Hmm, discrepancy. Maybe the continuous approximation isn't accurate here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual limit is larger than x₁/(1 -x₁). Anyway, the important thing is that the differential equation suggests the existence of a finite limit, which might be leveraged to prove the sequence is bounded.\n\nTo make this rigorous, maybe use comparison with the continuous solution. Suppose we show that xₙ ≤f(n), where f(n) is the solution to the differential equation which converges. Then, since f(n) converges, xₙ is bounded and hence converges.\n\nAlternatively, use induction to show xₙ ≤1/(C - sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1/k²). Wait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Since x_{n+1} =xₙ +xₙ² /n², we can write this as:\n\n1/x_{n+1} =1/(xₙ +xₙ² /n²) =1/(xₙ(1 +xₙ /n²))=1/xₙ *1/(1 +xₙ /n²).\n\nUsing the inequality 1/(1 +a) ≤1 -a +a² for a>0 (from the Taylor series expansion), we get:\n\n1/x_{n+1} ≤1/xₙ (1 -xₙ /n² +xₙ² /n^4).\n\nMultiplying out:\n\n1/x_{n+1} ≤1/xₙ -1/n² +xₙ /n^4.\n\nRearranging:\n\n1/x_{n+1} -1/xₙ ≤ -1/n² +xₙ /n^4.\n\nSumming from n=1 to N:\n\n1/x_{N+1} -1/x₁ ≤ -Σ_{n=1}^N 1/n² +Σ_{n=1}^N xₙ /n^4.\n\nBut the left side is 1/x_{N+1} -1/x₁, and the right side is -Σ1/n² +Σxₙ/n^4. Rearranging:\n\n1/x_{N+1} ≤1/x₁ -Σ1/n² +Σxₙ/n^4.\n\nBut since xₙ is increasing, xₙ ≤x_{N+1} for n ≤N. So Σxₙ/n^4 ≤x_{N+1} Σ1/n^4. The series Σ1/n^4 converges to π^4/90≈1.0823. Thus,\n\n1/x_{N+1} ≤1/x₁ -Σ1/n² +x_{N+1} *Σ1/n^4.\n\nRearranging:\n\n1/x_{N+1} -x_{N+1} *Σ1/n^4 ≤1/x₁ -Σ1/n².\n\nBut this seems complicated to handle. However, if we can show that the left side is positive, then we have:\n\n1/x_{N+1} -x_{N+1} *C ≤D, where C=Σ1/n^4≈1.0823 and D=1/x₁ -π²/6.\n\nIf we assume that x_{N+1} ≤M, then 1/x_{N+1} ≥1/M, so:\n\n1/M -M*C ≤D ⇒1/M -CM ≤D.\n\nThis is a quadratic in M: -CM² -D M +1 ≥0 ⇒ CM² +D M -1 ≤0.\n\nThe roots of the quadratic CM² +D M -1=0 are M=(-D ±sqrt(D² +4C))/(2C). Since M must be positive, take the positive root:\n\nM=( -D +sqrt(D² +4C) )/(2C).\n\nBut D=1/x₁ -π²/6. For x₁ <6/(π²), D>0, so M exists. However, this is getting too involved and specific. Maybe this approach isn't the right path.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find a clear proof, perhaps I should look for a known result or a more straightforward method. Let's consider the following approach inspired by telescoping products.\n\nFrom the recursive formula x_{n+1}=xₙ(1 +xₙ/n²). Let's take the reciprocal:\n\nyₙ=1/xₙ. Then,\n\ny_{n+1}=1/x_{n+1}=1/(xₙ(1 +xₙ/n²))=1/(xₙ (1 +xₙ/n²))= yₙ /(1 +xₙ/n²).\n\nUsing the inequality 1/(1 +a) ≥1 -a for a>0,\n\ny_{n+1} ≥yₙ (1 -xₙ/n²)=yₙ -yₙ xₙ /n² =yₙ -1/n².\n\nThus,\n\ny_{n+1} ≥yₙ -1/n².\n\nTelescoping this from n=1 to N,\n\ny_{N+1} ≥y₁ -Σ_{n=1}^N 1/n².\n\nSince Σ1/n² <π²/6≈1.6449,\n\ny_{N+1} ≥y₁ -π²/6.\n\nRecall that y₁=1/x₁ >1 because x₁ ∈(0,1). So,\n\ny_{N+1} ≥1/x₁ -π²/6.\n\nTo ensure y_{N+1} remains positive (since yₙ=1/xₙ must be positive), we need 1/x₁ -π²/6 >0 ⇒x₁ <6/π²≈0.6079.\n\nThus, for x₁ <6/π², we have y_{N+1} ≥1/x₁ -π²/6 >0 ⇒x_{N+1} ≤1/(1/x₁ -π²/6).\n\nHence, the sequence is bounded above and increasing, so it converges.\n\nBut what if x₁ ≥6/π²≈0.6079? The above approach doesn't apply because y_{N+1} could become negative, which is impossible, so the inequality must still hold. Wait, even if x₁ ≥6/π², y_{N+1} is defined as 1/x_{N+1}, which is positive because x_{N+1} >0. So the inequality y_{N+1} ≥1/x₁ -π²/6 must hold, but if 1/x₁ -π²/6 ≤0, then the lower bound is non-positive, but y_{N+1} is positive. Thus, the bound is not useful, but the sequence yₙ is decreasing (since xₙ is increasing, yₙ=1/xₙ is decreasing). So yₙ is a decreasing sequence bounded below by 0, hence converges. Therefore, xₙ=1/yₙ converges as well.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me elaborate:\n\nDefine yₙ=1/xₙ. Since xₙ is increasing, yₙ is decreasing. We also have yₙ >0 for all n. By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, yₙ converges to some limit y≥0. Hence, xₙ=1/yₙ converges to 1/y (if y≠0) or diverges to infinity if y=0.\n\nBut we need to show that y>0, i.e., xₙ doesn't go to infinity. From the earlier inequality:\n\ny_{n+1} ≥yₙ -1/n².\n\nSumming from n=1 to N-1:\n\ny_N ≥y₁ -Σ_{n=1}^{N-1} 1/n² >y₁ -π²/6.\n\nIf y₁ >π²/6 (i.e., x₁ <6/π²), then y_N >0, so y≥y₁ -π²/6 >0, hence xₙ converges to 1/y.\n\nIf y₁ ≤π²/6 (i.e., x₁ ≥6/π²), then the lower bound y_N ≥y₁ -π²/6 could be ≤0, but since y_N is positive, the actual bound is y_N ≥0. However, yₙ is decreasing and bounded below by 0, so it still converges to some y≥0. But does y=0 or y>0?\n\nIf y=0, then xₙ→∞. But we need to show this doesn't happen. Suppose y=0. Then yₙ→0, so xₙ→∞. Let's see if this leads to a contradiction.\n\nFrom the recursion y_{n+1}=1/x_{n+1}=1/(xₙ +xₙ² /n²)=1/(xₙ(1 +xₙ /n²))=yₙ/(1 +xₙ /n²).\n\nIf xₙ→∞, then xₙ /n² →∞ if xₙ grows faster than n². But if xₙ grows slower than n², then xₙ /n² →0.\n\nBut if xₙ→∞ and xₙ /n²→0, then y_{n+1}≈yₙ (1 -xₙ /n²). But since xₙ→∞, this approximation might not hold. Alternatively, take logs:\n\nln y_{n+1}=ln yₙ -ln(1 +xₙ /n²).\n\nIf xₙ /n² is small, then ln(1 +xₙ /n²)≈xₙ /n². But if xₙ is growing such that xₙ /n² isn't small, then this approximation doesn't hold. If xₙ grows like n, then xₙ /n²=1/n→0, so ln y_{n+1}≈ln yₙ -xₙ /n². Summing this would give ln y_{N}≈ln y₁ -Σxₙ /n². If Σxₙ /n² diverges, then ln y_{N}→-∞, so y_N→0. But this requires that Σxₙ /n² diverges, which would happen if xₙ grows like n or faster. But if xₙ grows slower than n, then Σxₙ /n² converges, and y_N approaches a positive limit, contradicting y=0.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's step back.\n\nThe key idea from the yₙ approach is that yₙ is a decreasing sequence bounded below by 0, hence converges. Therefore, xₙ=1/yₙ also converges (possibly to infinity). But we need to show that yₙ does not converge to 0. Suppose for contradiction that yₙ→0 (i.e., xₙ→∞). Then, from the recursion:\n\ny_{n+1}=yₙ/(1 +xₙ/n²)=yₙ/(1 +1/(yₙ n²)).\n\nAs yₙ→0, 1/(yₙ n²)→∞, so y_{n+1}≈yₙ / (1/(yₙ n²))=yₙ² n².\n\nThus, y_{n+1}≈yₙ² n².\n\nIf yₙ→0, then we can model this as y_{n+1}≈yₙ² n². Let's see what this would imply. Suppose yₙ ~c/n^α for some α>0. Then:\n\ny_{n+1}≈ (c/n^α)^2 *n²= c² n^{2 -2α}.\n\nFor this to match y_{n+1}~c/(n+1)^α≈c/n^α (for large n), we need:\n\nc² n^{2 -2α} ≈c/n^α ⇒c² n^{2 -2α} =c n^{-α} ⇒c n^{2 -2α +α} =1 ⇒c n^{2 -α}=1.\n\nTo have this hold for all n, we need 2 -α=0 ⇒α=2, and c=1. Therefore, yₙ ~1/n². Let's check:\n\nIf yₙ≈1/n², then y_{n+1}≈(1/n²)^2 *n²=1/n². This is consistent. So if yₙ decays like 1/n², then y_{n+1}≈1/n²≈1/(n+1)^2 for large n. This suggests that yₙ~C/n² for some C.\n\nIf this is the case, then xₙ=1/yₙ ~n²/C, which would mean xₙ→∞. But does this align with the original recursion?\n\nIf xₙ~n²/C, then x_{n+1}=xₙ +xₙ²/n²≈n²/C + (n^4/C²)/n²=n²/C +n²/C²=n²(1/C +1/C²). But for large n, x_{n+1}~(n+1)^2/C≈n²/C +2n/C +1/C. Comparing with the previous expression:\n\nn²(1/C +1/C²)≈n²/C +n²/C² vs. n²/C +2n/C +1/C.\n\nFor these to match, we need 1/C²=0, which is impossible. Therefore, the assumption that yₙ~C/n² leading to xₙ~n²/C is inconsistent with the recursion. Hence, the decay of yₙ cannot be as slow as 1/n². Therefore, our earlier assumption that yₙ→0 leads to a contradiction in the recursion's behavior, implying that yₙ cannot approach 0. Thus, yₙ must converge to a positive limit, so xₙ converges to 1/y.\n\nThis completes the proof. Therefore, regardless of the initial x₁ in (0,1), the sequence xₙ converges.",
