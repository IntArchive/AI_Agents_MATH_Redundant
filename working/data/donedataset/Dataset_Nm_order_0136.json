    "Content": "Here's a riddle that I've been struggling with for a while: Let $A$ be a list of $n$ integers between 1 and $k$. Let $B$ be a list of $k$ integers between 1 and $n$. Prove that there's a non-empty subset of $A$ and a (non-empty) subset of $B$ having the same sum. Example: Say $n=3,\\ k=5$, and $A=\\{3,4,5\\},\\ B=\\{1,1,2,3,3\\}$. Then we can find $\\{1,3,3\\}\\subset B$ and $\\{3,4\\}\\subset A$ with the same sum (I know there're are simpler solutions in this example, it's just for demonstration). I tried to attack it from different directions: induction, pigeon-hole, combinatorics, but I couldn't make it work. Suggestions? Addition As this was so highly voted, I thought I should tell how I came about this riddle - it's an interesting story: I heard it from a friend of mine about 10 years ago when I just finished high school and he just graduated in math. I remeber him telling me the riddle and his solution, and I thought \"math is so cool, some day I'll also have a degree in math and will be able to solve riddles like this\". I don't know why I suddenly remembered this conversation, and why I remember only the problem and not the solution. but it turns out that now I have a degree, but I still can't.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Nice problem! I almost hate to post a solution. If you like puzzles and haven't put in any time on this one yet, I encourage you not to read further. Imagine writing the numbers in $A$ on a stack of cards, one number per card. We write the numbers of $B$ on a separate stack, again one per card. We then recursively define a sequence $s_j$ as follows: Initial value: $s_0=0$ . If $s_j \\leq 0$ , look at the top card of the $A$ stack; let the number written on it be $a$ . Set $s_{j+1} = s_j+a$ , and remove that card from the stack. If $s_j > 0$ , look at the top card of the $B$ stack; let the number written on it be $b$ . Set $s_{j+1} = s_j-b$ , and remove that card from the stack. Continue until you attempt to draw a card from an empty stack. Example: Taking $A = ( 3,4,5 )$ and $B = (1,1,2,3,3)$ as in the OP, we have $$\\begin{array}{|rrrrr|}\n\\hline\ns & A \\ \\mbox{deck} & B \\ \\mbox{deck} & A \\ \\mbox{cards used} & B \\ \\mbox{cards used} \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 345 & 11233 & & \\\\\n\\hline\n3 & 45 & 11233 & 3 & \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & 45 & 1233 & & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 45 & 233 & & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n-1 & 45 & 33 & & 2 \\\\\n\\hline\n3 & 5 & 33 & 4 & \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 5 & 3 & & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n5 & & 3 & 5 & \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & & & & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}$$ At this point we stop, because the next step would be to draw from the $B$ deck, but the $B$ deck is empty. (In this example, the $A$ deck is also empty, but that is a coincidence; they don't have to both run out.) Lemma 1: The numbers $s_j$ are always between $-n+1$ and $k$ . Proof by induction on $j$ . The base case is true. If $s_j$ is between $-n+1$ and $0$ , then $s_{j+1}$ is between $-n+k+1$ and $k$ ; if $s_j$ is between $1$ and $k$ then $s_{j+1}$ is between $-n+1$ and $-n+k$ . Since the intervals $[-n+1, 0]$ and $[1, k]$ cover every integer in $[-n+1, k]$ , this shows that, if $s_j \\in [-n+1, k]$ then $s_{j+1} \\in [-n+1,k]$ . $\\square$ . Lemma 2: The sequence $s_j$ repeats a value. (In the example, the values $0$ , $2$ and $3$ are repeated.) Let's suppose that the game ends when we try to draw from the $B$ stack; the other case is similar. So we must make $k+1$ attempts to draw from the $B$ -stack (including the attempt that fails). At the time that we make each attempt, $s_j$ is positive. So we have $k+1$ positive values of $s_j$ . By Lemma 1, each of these values lies in $[1,k]$ . So some value must appear more than once. $\\square$ Proof of the result Let $s_i=s_j$ . Then the set of $A$ cards which are dealt between $s_i$ and $s_j$ must have the same value as the set of $B$ cards. For example, if we use the repeated $3$ 's in the example sequence, then we see that $-1-1-2+4=0$ or, in other words, $4=1+1+2$ . $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user provided a riddle from Math Stack Exchange. The original problem is about subsets of two lists, A and B, with specific constraints. The goal is to prove that there's a non-empty subset of A and a non-empty subset of B with the same sum.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the key assumptions. Let's read through the problem again. The question states:\n\n- Let A be a list of n integers between 1 and k.\n- Let B be a list of k integers between 1 and n.\n- We need to prove that there exists a non-empty subset of A and a non-empty subset of B with the same sum.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are about the structure of A and B. Each element in A is between 1 and k, inclusive. Similarly, each element in B is between 1 and n, inclusive. Also, both subsets must be non-empty.\n\nWait, the example given is when n=3, k=5, A={3,4,5}, B={1,1,2,3,3}. Then subsets {3,4} from A and {1,3,3} from B both sum to 7. The problem is general, not restricted to specific n and k, so the assumptions should be general.\n\nNow, structuring the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\n1. A is a list of n integers.\n2. Each integer in A is between 1 and k, inclusive.\n3. B is a list of k integers.\n4. Each integer in B is between 1 and n, inclusive.\n5. The subsets of A and B in consideration are non-empty.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"non-empty subset of A and a (non-empty) subset of B\". So the non-emptiness is a condition of the subsets, not of the original lists. However, in the assumptions, maybe we need to state that the subsets must be non-empty. Alternatively, since the problem statement itself mentions \"non-empty\", maybe the assumptions focus on the original lists' properties.\n\nLet me check the example provided by the user. In the example, the original problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91. The assumptions listed were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a misformatting there. But perhaps the user intended to show an example where assumptions were extracted, even if they were not explicitly stated. Hmm, maybe the example is not correct. But regardless, in our current problem, the user wants us to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The original problem says \"Let A be a list of n integers between 1 and k\". So each element in A is between 1 and k. Similarly, B is a list of k integers between 1 and n. The problem is to prove there exist non-empty subsets of each with the same sum.\n\nSo assumptions would be:\n\n1. A is a list of n integers.\n2. Each integer in A is between 1 and k, inclusive.\n3. B is a list of k integers.\n4. Each integer in B is between 1 and n, inclusive.\n5. The subsets considered must be non-empty.\n\nBut the fifth point is part of the problem statement's conclusion, not an assumption. Wait, the problem is to prove that there exists such subsets. So the problem is under the conditions that A and B are as described, and the conclusion is that non-empty subsets exist. Therefore, the assumptions are the first four points. The fifth is part of the problem's requirement.\n\nWait, the problem states \"non-empty subset of A and a (non-empty) subset of B\". So the non-emptiness is part of what needs to be proven. So the assumptions are the four points about the lists A and B. The problem is to show that under these conditions, such subsets exist.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a list of n integers.\n- Each integer in A is between 1 and k.\n- B is a list of k integers.\n- Each integer in B is between 1 and n.\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists a non-empty subset of A and a non-empty subset of B with the same sum.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, they included the divisibility condition even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect, or maybe the user made a mistake there. But in our current problem, the user's example shows that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem might list specific assumptions. However, in this case, the original problem doesn't have any hidden assumptions; it's all stated. So the four points I listed are the assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"Let A be a list of n integers between 1 and k. Let B be a list of k integers between 1 and n.\" So these are the given conditions. So the assumptions are exactly those.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list each of these as separate assumptions. Each line addresses one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a list of n integers,\nEach integer in A is between 1 and k (inclusive),\nB is a list of k integers,\nEach integer in B is between 1 and n (inclusive).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a non-empty subset of A and a non-empty subset of B with the same sum.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The problem doesn't mention any additional constraints like n and k being positive integers, but since A has n integers and B has k integers, n and k must be positive integers. However, since the problem is likely in the context of discrete math, we can assume n and k are positive integers. But the original problem doesn't state that explicitly. The example given uses n=3 and k=5, which are positive integers. So perhaps we should include that n and k are positive integers. But the original problem says \"between 1 and k\", which implies k is at least 1, so n and k are positive integers. So maybe that's an implicit assumption. However, since the user's example didn't include such assumptions, perhaps we should stick to the explicitly mentioned conditions.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the lists have n and k elements, then n and k are positive integers. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nk is a positive integer,\nA is a list of n integers,\nEach integer in A is between 1 and k (inclusive),\nB is a list of k integers,\nEach integer in B is between 1 and n (inclusive).\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user didn't explicitly state \"n and k are positive integers\", but given that the lists have n and k elements, that's implied. However, to be thorough, it's better to include those as assumptions. But maybe the user's example didn't include such implicit assumptions. For instance, in the example given, the problem was to prove for every integer n, and the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might have been a mistake, but perhaps the original problem had a different statement. Anyway, in our current problem, to be precise, the problem states \"Let A be a list of n integers between 1 and k\", which implies n is a positive integer (since you can't have a list of 0 integers in this context). Similarly, k must be a positive integer because elements are between 1 and k. So these are safe assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include n and k being positive integers. So each of these is a separate line:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nk is a positive integer,\nA is a list of n integers,\nEach integer in A is between 1 and k (inclusive),\nB is a list of k integers,\nEach integer in B is between 1 and n (inclusive).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a non-empty subset of A and a non-empty subset of B with the same sum.\n\nThis seems comprehensive. Each line addresses one property. The first two lines establish n and k as positive integers. Then A and B are defined with their respective sizes and element ranges.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example again. The example's original problem was about divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13. The user's formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was a mistake. However, in our current problem, the assumptions are explicitly given in the problem statement, so we should include all the given conditions as separate assumptions.",
