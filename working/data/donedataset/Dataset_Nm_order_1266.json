    "Content": "In one of his letters to G. H. Hardy, Ramanujan gave the following sum $$\\dfrac{1}{1^{7}\\cosh\\left(\\dfrac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} - \\dfrac{1}{3^{7}\\cosh\\left(\\dfrac{3\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} + \\dfrac{1}{5^{7}\\cosh\\left(\\dfrac{5\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} - \\cdots = \\frac{\\pi^{7}}{23040}\\tag{1}$$ or using $\\sum $ notation $$\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{(-1)^{n}}{(2n + 1)^{7}\\cosh\\left(\\dfrac{(2n + 1)\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^{7}}{23040}$$ Since $\\cosh y = (e^{y} + e^{-y})/2$ we can see that the sum is equal to $$S = 2\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{(-1)^{n}\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{(2n + 1)\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)}{(2n + 1)^{7}\\left\\{1 + \\exp\\left(-(2n + 1)\\pi\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right\\}}$$ Putting $$q = \\exp\\left(-\\pi\\sqrt{3}\\right)$$ we get the sum as $$S = 2\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n}q^{n + 1/2}}{(2n + 1)^{7}(1 + q^{2n + 1})}$$ We can then use $$\\dfrac{q^{n + 1/2}}{1 + q^{2n + 1}} = \\frac{q^{n + 1/2} - q^{3(n + 1/2)}}{1 - q^{4n + 2}}$$ and hope to use the Ramanujan functions $P, Q, R$ given by $$P(q) = 1 - 24\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{nq^{2n}}{1 - q^{2n}}\\\\\nQ(q) = 1 + 240\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{3}q^{2n}}{1 - q^{2n}}\\\\\nR(q) = 1 - 504\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{5}q^{2n}}{1 - q^{2n}}$$ to calculate the sum $S$ in terms of $P, Q, R$. However the stumbling block is the term $(2n + 1)^{7}$ appearing in the denominator. Therefore I am not sure if the functions $P, Q, R$ can be used in the evaluation of sum $S$. Please let me know if there are any other approaches to calculate the sum $S$. Update : While going through Ramanujan's Notebooks Vol 3 (by Bruce C. Berndt) I found the proof for the above sum. But he uses a highly non-obvious formula (also discovered by Ramanujan) $$\\frac{u^{6n}}{\\cos u\\cos(\\omega u)\\cos(\\omega^{2}u)} = 12\\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{(-1)^{k}\\left\\{\\left(k + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi\\right\\}^{6n + 5}}{\\left[\\left\\{\\left(k + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi\\right\\}^{6} - u^{6}\\right]\\cosh\\left\\{\\left(k + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi\\sqrt{3}\\right\\}}\\tag{2}$$ where $\\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity. Berndt goes on to say that Ramanujan probably obtained this formula $(2)$ via partial fractions and says that it can be obtained by a routine procedure with somewhat lengthy calculation. The method of partial fractions is used to express a rational function (for the purpose of integrating them) in the form of a sum of finite terms which can be integrated via standard formulas. I am nor sure how that could be extended to any general function (which is not rational) and thereby produce a series. Berndt says \"the sum $(1)$ can be obtained by putting $n = 0$ in $(2)$ and then equating coefficients of $u^{6}$ on both sides\". This part requires some reasonable amount of calculation, but it is not so difficult. I want to understand the technique of partial fractions as applied to general functions (may be with some requirement of continuity and differentiability) and its proper justification so that I can provide a proof of formula $(2)$ for myself and thereby have a complete proof of the Ramanujan's sum $(1)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem and extract the assumptions and the main problem statement. \n\nThe original question is about summing a specific series that Ramanujan provided. The series is an alternating sum involving terms with (2n+1)^7 and hyperbolic cosine functions. The user also mentions using Ramanujan's functions P, Q, R but encounters a problem with the (2n+1)^7 term. Then, they refer to a formula from Berndt's book involving partial fractions and wants to apply it to prove the sum.\n\nMy task is to filter out unrelated information and list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are concise and each on a separate line. The problem is restated without extra details.\n\nIn the given question, the key elements are:\n- The series is from n=0 to infinity.\n- The terms alternate sign (-1)^n.\n- Each term has 1 divided by (2n+1)^7 times cosh((2n+1)π√3/2).\n- The sum equals π^7/23040.\n- The user tried using q = exp(-π√3) and transformed the series but hit a stumbling block with (2n+1)^7.\n- Mention of Ramanujan's formula (2) involving cos terms and partial fractions.\n\nAssumptions need to be the conditions given in the problem. The problem statement is to prove the sum equals π^7/23040. However, the user also wants to understand the technique of partial fractions applied here, but the main problem to structure is the original sum.\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the original problem doesn't state any conditions on n because it's a sum from n=0 to infinity. However, the problem might have implicit assumptions, such as the convergence of the series, but the user hasn't mentioned any. The series is given as is. So perhaps the assumptions are about the structure of the series.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumptions are the given expressions. But the example included specific conditions on n. Here, since the problem is to compute the sum, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the structure of the series. Wait, but the example had a problem where an assumption was added (n divisible by 7), but in the original problem, that was part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's listed as an assumption. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in the example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, but then the formatted problem also lists \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is wrong. Hmm. But I need to follow the user's example structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem includes all the necessary assumptions for the problem to hold. So in the original problem, to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but actually, the problem might require that n is an integer, but not necessarily divisible by 7. Wait, but 91 is 7*13. Maybe the problem holds for all integers n, but in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was mistyped. Anyway, that's the example given. So perhaps the user expects to extract assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is dealing with a series sum. The problem is to prove that the sum equals π^7/23040. The assumptions would be the components of the series: alternating signs, terms involve (2n+1)^7 and hyperbolic cosine. But each assumption line should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the original problem.\n\nThe series is sum_{n=0}^infty (-1)^n / [(2n+1)^7 cosh((2n+1)π√3/2)] = π^7/23040.\n\nSo the assumptions could be:\n\n- The series is from n = 0 to infinity.\n- Each term alternates in sign: (-1)^n.\n- Denominator of each term is (2n + 1)^7 multiplied by hyperbolic cosine of (2n + 1)π√3/2.\n\nBut each assumption line should be one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series is over n starting from 0 to infinity,\nEach term in the series is multiplied by (-1)^n,\nEach term has a denominator of (2n + 1)^7,\nEach term's denominator includes cosh((2n + 1)π√3/2).\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed as separate lines. So each bullet point is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe summation index n ranges from 0 to infinity,\nThe series is alternating with factor (-1)^n,\nEach term has a denominator of (2n + 1)^7,\nEach term's denominator includes cosh((2n + 1)π√3/2).\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum equals π^7/23040.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is exactly as stated, and the assumptions are inherent in the problem's structure.\n\nWait, the example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in reality, the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7; it was for every integer n. So perhaps the example was incorrect. But the user might have intended to include the conditions necessary for the problem. If the problem is to prove divisibility by 91, and 91=7*13, maybe the problem requires n to be an integer and 7 divides n, but that's not clear. Anyway, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are just the components of the series.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is presented as given, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series definition, so the assumptions are the components of the series. Therefore, each part of the series' structure is an assumption.\n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series is ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / [(2n + 1)^7 cosh((2n + 1)π√3/2)],\nProblem:\nProve that the sum equals π^7 / 23040.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be line by line, each addressing one property. So breaking down the series into its components:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series is an infinite sum starting from n = 0,\nEach term of the series includes a factor of (-1)^n,\nEach term has a denominator component of (2n + 1)^7,\nEach term's denominator includes cosh((2n + 1)π√3/2).\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum equals π^7 / 23040.\n\nI think this is the correct way. Each bullet is a separate assumption about the structure of the series. Then the problem is to prove the sum equals the given value.\n\nThe user also mentions several approaches and references, but the core problem is to prove the sum equals π^7 / 23040. The rest is context and attempts, which should be filtered out.\n\nSo, final structured problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series is summed from n = 0 to infinity,\nEach term includes the factor (-1)^n,\nEach term's denominator contains (2n + 1)^7,\nEach term's denominator contains cosh((2n + 1)π√3 / 2).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{(-1)^{n}}{(2n + 1)^{7}\\cosh\\left(\\dfrac{(2n + 1)\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^{7}}{23040}.$$",
