    "Content": "My attempts: I cannot apply the Eisenstein's criteria here, because there is no prime number that divides the constant term i.e. $1$ Taking a translation of the form $x \\rightarrow x+a$ does not solve this issue either. Next, I tried the mod tests: $\\operatorname{mod}2$ doesn't work since $x^4-x^2+1=(x^2+x+1)(x^2-x+1)$, similarly in $\\operatorname{mod}3$ $x^4-x^2+1=(x^2+1)^2$. Now I can go on and maybe eventually find a $\\operatorname{mod}p$ that works, but that is very time consuming, specially in examinations. So, I'll use the rational root test. The possibilities for roots are $\\pm 1$ and it is easy to see that neither is a root. The only possibility left then are quadratic factors, say, $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)=x^4-x^2+1$ This gives me a set of equations $bd=1, a+c=0, b+d+ac=-1$. So either $b=d=1$, in which case $a=\\pm \\sqrt3 \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, or $b=d=-1$, which gives $a=\\pm i \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$. So such factorization is not possible and hence the given polynomial is irreducible. Is this solution correct? Also, is there an easier way to solve this? Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are no rational roots, so no linear factors. If $p(x)$ is a factor of $x^4-x^2+1$ then $p(-x)$ is, too. If $x^4-x^2+1 = (x^2+a)(x^2+b)$ then $x^2-x+1=(x+a)(x+b)$. Show that $x^2-x+1$ is irreducible. On the other hand, you'd have to have $x^4-x^2+1=(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+b)$ where $b^2=1$ and $a\\neq 0$. This means that $x^4+(2b-a^2)x^2+b^2 = x^4-x^2+1$. So you need $2b-a^2=-1$. If $b=-1,$ then this means $a^2=-1$, and if $b=1$ then $a^2=3$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given example. Let's read through the original question again carefully. The user is asking to show that the polynomial x⁴ - x² + 1 is irreducible over the rationals. They tried Eisenstein's criterion, translations, and modular tests mod 2 and 3, which didn't work. Then they used the rational root test and checked for quadratic factors, leading them to conclude irreducibility. They want confirmation if their solution is correct and if there's an easier way.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about the polynomial x⁴ - x² + 1. The key assumptions here are the polynomial itself and the field over which it's considered, which is ℚ. The problem doesn't mention any specific conditions on the coefficients or variable substitutions beyond trying Eisenstein, translations, etc., but those are part of their attempts, not the problem's assumptions. The core assumption is that we're working over the rational numbers. So the main assumption is the polynomial is defined over ℚ. Then the problem is to prove its irreducibility over ℚ.\n\nWait, in the example given, they included assumptions about the variable (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). Here, the polynomial is given, and the field is specified. So the assumption would be that the polynomial is x⁴ - x² + 1 and it's considered over ℚ. But the problem is to show irreducibility over ℚ. So perhaps the assumption is just the polynomial, but maybe also that the coefficients are in ℚ. Wait, the polynomial already has integer coefficients, so it's naturally in ℚ[x]. So perhaps the only assumption needed is the polynomial itself and the field. But in the example, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user in the example had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Let me check.\n\nWait, the original example problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions list n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem according to the format. So in the given example, the user restructured the problem by possibly adding an incorrect assumption? Or maybe the original problem had a mistake. Hmm. But regardless, for the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem into assumptions and problem statement.\n\nThe current problem is to show that x⁴ - x² + 1 is irreducible over ℚ. The assumptions would be:\n\n1. The polynomial is x⁴ - x² + 1.\n2. The polynomial is considered over the field ℚ.\n\nBut maybe since the problem is to show irreducibility over ℚ, the main assumption is that the polynomial is in ℚ[x], but since it's given with integer coefficients, that's inherent. Alternatively, the problem is just \"Show that x⁴ - x² + 1 is irreducible over ℚ\", so the only assumption is the polynomial and the field. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The polynomial is x⁴ - x² + 1,\nAssumption: The polynomial is considered over the field ℚ.\n\nProblem: Show that x⁴ - x² + 1 is irreducible over ℚ.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the example is not a good model. But the user might have intended that the assumptions are to list the problem's conditions. So maybe in the current problem, the assumptions are just the given polynomial and the field. So I'll proceed accordingly.",
