    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side using trigonometry instead of linear inequalities. Hmm, normally I remember this as the triangle inequality theorem, usually proven geometrically or with vectors. But using trigonometry... How can that be approached?\n\nFirst, I need to recall trigonometric identities or laws related to triangles. The Law of Cosines comes to mind. It relates the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. The formula is c² = a² + b² - 2ab cosγ, where γ is the angle opposite side c. Maybe this can be used here.\n\nLet's consider a triangle with sides a, b, and c. We need to show, for example, that a + b > c. Using the Law of Cosines, c² = a² + b² - 2ab cosγ. If I can relate this to (a + b)², which is a² + 2ab + b². Comparing the two, c² = (a + b)² - 2ab(1 + cosγ). Since γ is an angle in a triangle, it must be between 0 and 180 degrees, so cosγ is between -1 and 1. But specifically, since it's a valid triangle angle, γ can't be 0 or 180, so cosγ is actually between -1 and 1, not inclusive. Therefore, 1 + cosγ would be between 0 and 2. So 2ab(1 + cosγ) is positive, which means c² < (a + b)². Taking square roots (since sides are positive), this would imply c < a + b. That seems to work!\n\nBut wait, does this cover all cases? The Law of Cosines applies to any triangle, so this should hold for any angle. So by applying this to each angle, we can get all three inequalities: a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. That makes sense. The key step is recognizing that the cosine term is less than 1, making the subtracted term positive, hence c² is less than (a + b)². Therefore, their square roots preserve the inequality.\n\nAnother trigonometric approach might involve using the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that a/sinα = b/sinβ = c/sinγ = 2R, where R is the circumradius. Maybe we can express the sides in terms of the angles and R. For example, a = 2R sinα, b = 2R sinβ, c = 2R sinγ. Then, to show a + b > c, substitute: 2R sinα + 2R sinβ > 2R sinγ. Dividing both sides by 2R gives sinα + sinβ > sinγ. Since in a triangle, angles α + β + γ = π, so γ = π - α - β. Then sinγ = sin(π - α - β) = sin(α + β). So the inequality becomes sinα + sinβ > sin(α + β). Let's test this with angles. Suppose α = β = 60°, then α + β = 120°, sin60 + sin60 = √3 ≈ 1.732, sin120 = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 1.732 > 0.866 holds. Another example: α = 30°, β = 45°, then α + β = 75°, sin30 + sin45 = 0.5 + √2/2 ≈ 0.5 + 0.707 = 1.207, sin75 ≈ 0.966. So 1.207 > 0.966 still holds. But is this always true? Let's consider the general case. Let’s use trigonometric identities: sinα + sinβ = 2 sin[(α+β)/2] cos[(α-β)/2]. And sin(α + β) = sinγ. So the inequality becomes 2 sin[(α+β)/2] cos[(α-β)/2] > sin(α + β). Let’s let θ = α + β, so θ = π - γ. Then the inequality is 2 sin(θ/2) cos[(α - β)/2] > sinθ. Using the double angle identity, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So substituting, we have 2 sin(θ/2) cos[(α - β)/2] > 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Divide both sides by 2 sin(θ/2) (which is positive since θ is between 0 and π, so sin(θ/2) > 0). The inequality simplifies to cos[(α - β)/2] > cos(θ/2). Since θ = π - γ, and γ > 0, θ < π. Also, (α - β)/2 can range between (-θ/2, θ/2) depending on α and β. But since cos is decreasing on [0, π], we need to compare the arguments. If we can show that |(α - β)/2| < θ/2, then cos[(α - β)/2] > cos(θ/2). Indeed, since α and β are positive and sum to θ, the maximum difference between α and β is less than θ. For example, if α = θ - ε and β = ε, then |α - β| = θ - 2ε < θ. Hence, |(α - β)/2| < θ/2. Therefore, since cosine is decreasing, cos of the smaller angle is larger. Therefore, cos[(α - β)/2] > cos(θ/2). Therefore, the inequality holds. Therefore, sinα + sinβ > sinγ, which translates back to a + b > c. Thus, this approach also works.\n\nSo there are at least two trigonometric methods: one using the Law of Cosines and another using the Law of Sines. Both require leveraging trigonometric identities and properties of angles in a triangle. The key insight is that the trigonometric functions of the angles, due to their relationships in a triangle, lead to the necessary inequalities between the sides.\n\nAnother possible approach might use the area formula involving sine, but I think the Law of Cosines and Law of Sines methods are more straightforward. It's important to ensure that all steps are valid, especially when dealing with inequalities and trigonometric functions. Also, considering the range of angles in a triangle (between 0 and π) is crucial because cosine and sine have specific behaviors in this interval that make the inequalities hold.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be approached trigonometrically by either method, and the assumptions are simply those inherent to a triangle: three sides with positive lengths satisfying the triangle angle sum property, and each angle being between 0 and π radians.",
