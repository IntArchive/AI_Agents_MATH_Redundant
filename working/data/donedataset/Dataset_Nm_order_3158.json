    "Content": "I am an undergraduate student in Bachelors in Mathematics undergoing a  course in Algebraic Number Theory.  I am stuck on the following problem: Let $n\\in \\mathbb N$ . Let $d_1<d_2<\\dotso<d_w$ be the set of proper positive divisors of $n$ . Is it true that if $n\\notin\\{p^2,pq\\}$ , then for $i\\neq j$ we must have \\begin{align}\n\\sum _{\\substack\n{k=1\\\\d_k\\mid d_i\\; \\text{or}\\; d_i\\mid d_k\\\\ k\\neq i}}^w \\phi(d_k)\\neq \\sum _{\\substack\n{k=1\\\\d_k\\mid d_j \\; \\text{or}\\; d_j\\mid d_k\\\\ k\\neq j}}^w \\phi(d_k)?\n\\end{align} My try : I tried it with some examples and for all of them I found the above proposition true. But the problem is I can't prove this in general. Example : Take $n=12$ . Its divisors are $2,3,4,6$ . Let us take $d_1=2$ and $d_2=3$ . Hence $i=1,j=2$ . Also $d_1=2$ divides $4,6$ .\nMoreover $d_2=3$ divides only $6$ . Thus \\begin{align}\n\\sum _{\\substack\n{k=1\\\\d_k\\mid d_i \\; \\text{or}\\; d_i\\mid d_k\\\\ k\\neq i}}^w \\phi(d_k)=\\phi(4)+\\phi(6)=4.\n\\end{align} Again \\begin{align}\n\\sum _{\\substack\n{k=1\\\\d_k\\mid d_i \\; \\text{or}\\; d_i\\mid d_k\\\\ k\\neq i}}^w \\phi(d_k)=\\phi(6)=2,\n\\end{align} hence they are not equal for $i=1,j=2$ . If we do similar examples, I find the proposition true. Can someone please help me how to prove this in general.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No, this is not true. Take $n=18$ . The (proper, not including $1$ or $18$ ) divisors are $\\{2,3,6,9\\}$ . The only such divisor which $2$ divides or which divides $2$ (besides itself) is $6$ , while the only such divisor for $9$ is $3$ . So, the sum is $\\phi(6)=\\phi(3)=2$ for either $2$ or $9$ . In general, for an odd prime $p$ , the divisors $2$ and $p^2$ of $2p^2$ exhibit the same property. There are more \"exotic\" examples as well, including the first odd counterexample, $297$ . Here, the divisors $9$ and $11$ lead to equal sums. The general pattern here is that $297=p^3q$ with $p^2+2=q$ , and it is not known that there are infinitely many pairs of primes with this pattern.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about number theory. The user is asking whether a certain proposition holds. The proposition involves the divisors of a natural number n and sums of Euler's totient function under specific conditions. \n\nLet me break it down. The problem states: Let n be a natural number. Let d₁ < d₂ < ... < d_w be the proper positive divisors of n. The claim is that if n is not in the set {p², pq} where p and q are primes, then for any distinct i and j, the sums of φ(d_k) where d_k divides d_i or is divided by d_i (excluding k=i) are not equal for i and j.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. The problem states n is a natural number, n is not of the form p² or pq (where p and q are primes), and the divisors are proper and ordered. \n\nWait, the problem says \"proper positive divisors\", so that's an assumption. Also, the condition that n is not in {p², pq} is another assumption. Also, i and j are distinct. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking whether for i ≠ j, the sums are not equal. So maybe the assumption is that i ≠ j, but in the problem statement, the user is to prove that under the given conditions (n not p² or pq), for i ≠ j, the sums are unequal. Hmm.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\n- d₁, d₂, ..., d_w are the proper positive divisors of n, ordered increasingly.\n\n- n is not equal to p² or pq for primes p, q.\n\n- i and j are distinct indices (i ≠ j).\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the conclusion is about for all i ≠ j, the sums are not equal. So the problem is: Given n not in {p², pq}, then for all i ≠ j, the sums are unequal. So the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem holds.\n\nSo to structure:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\n- The proper positive divisors of n are d₁ < d₂ < ... < d_w.\n\n- n is not of the form p² or pq, where p and q are primes.\n\n- i and j are distinct indices (i ≠ j).\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum ∑_{k=1, d_k divides d_i or d_i divides d_k, k≠i}^w φ(d_k) is not equal to the sum ∑_{k=1, d_k divides d_j or d_j divides d_k, k≠j}^w φ(d_k).\n\nWait, but the original problem statement is asking whether the proposition holds, i.e., whether under the conditions given, the sums are unequal. So the problem is to determine if the proposition is true, but in the example given by the user, they structured it as \"Prove that...\". However, in the original question, the user is asking if it's true and for help proving it. So maybe the problem statement here is to prove the proposition given the assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have the assumptions as n being a natural number with proper divisors ordered, n not p² or pq, and i ≠ j, and the problem is to prove the inequality of the sums.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem changed it to assume that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. That might be an error. But according to the user's example, they filtered the original problem's assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem's example was different. Let me check.\n\nIn the example given by the user, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because 91 is 7×13, so maybe the problem actually required n to be divisible by both 7 and 13? Or perhaps the user's example has an error. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the formatted version corrected it. However, given that, perhaps in this current problem, I need to list all the assumptions from the original problem.\n\nWait, in the current problem, the original question says: Let n be in N. Let d₁ < d₂ < ... < d_w be the set of proper positive divisors of n. Is it true that if n is not in {p², pq}, then for i ≠ j, the sums are unequal?\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\n- The proper positive divisors of n are d₁ < d₂ < ... < d_w.\n\n- n is not of the form p² or pq, where p and q are primes.\n\n- i and j are distinct indices (i ≠ j).\n\nProblem: Prove that the two sums as defined are not equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as asking whether the proposition holds, but the formatted version should present it as a problem to prove, given the assumptions. So the answer should structure the problem with the assumptions listed, and the problem being to prove the inequality of sums.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\n- The set of proper positive divisors of n is ordered as d₁ < d₂ < … < d_w.\n\n- n is not in {p², pq} where p and q are primes.\n\n- i and j are distinct indices.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∑_{k=1, d_k ∣ d_i or d_i ∣ d_k, k≠i}^w φ(d_k) ≠ ∑_{k=1, d_k ∣ d_j or d_j ∣ d_k, k≠j}^w φ(d_k).\n\nBut need to check if each assumption is a single property applied to one object. For example, \"n is a natural number\" is one assumption. \"The set of proper positive divisors of n is ordered as d₁ < d₂ < … < d_w\" is another. \"n is not in {p², pq} where p and q are primes\" is another. \"i and j are distinct indices\" is another. Each of these is a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be as follows.",
