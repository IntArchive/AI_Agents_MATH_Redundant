    "AcceptedAnswer": "Rudin's \"Real and Complex Analysis\" gives this a thorough examination, but this is a brief overview. Let $\\mu$ be an absolutely continuous, complex Borel measure on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $f$ be the Radon-Nikodym (RN) derivative of $\\mu$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure $\\sigma$. Then the symmetric derivative of $\\mu$ (written $\\mu '=f~a.e.$) with respect to $\\sigma$ holds, and we can write $\\mu$ as the integral of the symmetric derivative over Borel sets in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, ie, \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mu (B)=\\int_B \\mu'd\\sigma .\n\\end{equation*} Let $\\{ B_i(x)\\}$ be a sequence of Borel sets in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ converging to $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $f$ integrable over $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Then at every Lebesgue point (or by definition, $a.e.$ with respect to $\\sigma$), $~f$ can be written in the form \n\\begin{equation*}\nf(x)=\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\sigma(B_i(x))}\\int_{B_i(x)}fd\\sigma .\n\\end{equation*}\nNote that a Lebesgue point can be thought of as a point where $f$ does not oscillate much, so the shrinking of $\\{B_i(x)\\}$ will be \"nice\" or \"well-behaved\". Combining this together implies that if $f$ is integrable on $\\mathbb{R}$ and \n\\begin{equation*}\nF(x)=\\int^{x}_{-\\infty}fd\\sigma,~x\\in\\mathbb{R}, \n\\end{equation*}\nthen $F'(x)=f(x)$ at every Lebesgue point of $f$, and consequently $a.e.$ with respect to $\\sigma$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want me to act as a bilingual mathematics professor, specifically handling questions from Math Stack Exchange. The task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem into their specified format, which includes listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem was about proving that a certain expression A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted version listed assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example has a mistake? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. But maybe the user intended that the problem was miswritten, and the assumptions are part of the problem's actual conditions? Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect, but I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nNow, the current problem to format is from Math Stack Exchange: Title is \"Proof that absolute continuity implies differentiability a.e.\" and the question is asking for a book or resource that provides a proof of that implication.\n\nSo, I need to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. The assumptions here would be the conditions required for the implication. The problem is to prove that absolute continuity implies differentiability almost everywhere. But the original question is a reference request, not a problem to solve. However, the user wants me to structure it as per the format, which in the example turned a problem into assumptions and the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove something for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error unless the original problem was mistyped. But perhaps the example is illustrative of how to extract assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current case, the question is about a proof that absolute continuity implies differentiability a.e. So the assumptions would be the conditions of the function. Let me think. Absolute continuity is a property of a function on an interval, usually [a,b]. The function being absolutely continuous is the assumption. The problem is to show that such a function is differentiable almost everywhere.\n\nSo the assumption here is that the function is absolutely continuous on an interval, say [a,b]. But since the problem is general, maybe we don't need to specify the interval unless it's part of the problem. Let me check the original question again. The user's original question was: \"Can somebody recommend a book/resource that provides a proof that absolute continuity of a function implies its almost-everywhere differentiability?\"\n\nSo the problem here is the implication: if a function is absolutely continuous, then it is differentiable a.e. Therefore, the assumption is that the function is absolutely continuous. The problem is to prove that it's differentiable almost everywhere.\n\nBut in the user's example, they included multiple assumptions. However, here, there might be only one assumption. Let me check. The absolute continuity is a single condition on the function. Therefore, the assumption would be: \"f is an absolutely continuous function on [a,b].\" Then the problem is to prove that f is differentiable almost everywhere on [a,b].\n\nBut since the original question didn't specify the interval, maybe we can state it more generally. However, absolute continuity is typically defined on an interval. So the assumption should include that f is absolutely continuous on an interval [a,b]. So the assumption would be: \"f is a function defined on the interval [a,b]\", \"f is absolutely continuous on [a,b]\". Wait, but \"defined on [a,b]\" and \"absolutely continuous on [a,b]\" could be two separate assumptions, each addressing one property. So per the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on the interval [a,b],\n- f is absolutely continuous on [a,b].\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is differentiable almost everywhere on [a,b].\n\nBut the original question is a reference request, not a problem to prove. However, the user's example took the original problem (which was to prove something) and structured it into assumptions and problem. Here, the user's question is asking for a resource, but perhaps the underlying problem is the theorem statement. So the task is to structure the theorem as per the format.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the problem would be \"Prove that absolute continuity of a function implies its almost-everywhere differentiability.\" And the assumptions would be the function is absolutely continuous. However, the exact assumptions depend on the precise statement of the theorem. The standard theorem is that if a function is absolutely continuous on [a,b], then it is differentiable almost everywhere on [a,b]. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a function defined on the interval [a,b],\n- f is absolutely continuous on [a,b].\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is differentiable almost everywhere on [a,b].\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list those two assumptions (each on its own line) and then the problem statement.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single condition. The first is about the domain of f, the second is the property of absolute continuity. So yes, they are separate.",
