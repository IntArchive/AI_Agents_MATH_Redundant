Now consider $$a^{-1}\\cdot(a \\cdot b) =a^{-1}\\cdot(a\\cdot c)$$ By associativity, we have $$(a^{-1}\\cdot a)\\cdot b = (a^{-1}\\cdot a)\\cdot c$$ By the definition of inverse, we have $$e\\cdot b = e\\cdot c$$ where $e$ is the identity element (s.t. $e\\cdot x = x\\cdot e = x$ for all $x \\in G$).

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, focusing on one property per line and one object each. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the problem in the Math Stack Exchange question: The user is asking how to prove that in a group G, if a∘b = a∘c, then b = c. That's the cancellation law in groups. The original question mentions starting with b = b∘e (which is using the identity element) and then trying associativity but not getting further.\n\nSo, the task here is to extract the assumptions from the problem. The key points here are that G is a group, and the operation ∘ is the group operation. In a group, the axioms include closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses. The problem specifically uses the cancellation law, which relies on the existence of inverses.\n\nAssumptions would be:\n1. G is a group under the operation ∘.\n2. a, b, c are elements of G.\n3. The group operation ∘ is associative.\n4. There exists an identity element e in G such that for any element g in G, g∘e = e∘g = g.\n5. Every element in G has an inverse; for each a in G, there exists an element a^{-1} in G such that a∘a^{-1} = a^{-1}∘a = e.\n6. The equation a∘b = a∘c holds in G.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. But the problem statement might not mention all these explicitly. The original problem states \"for a group G\", so that's the main assumption. The elements a, b, c are part of the problem statement. The problem is to prove that b = c given a∘b = a∘c.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction had the original problem mentioning that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was listed as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So perhaps the example includes both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific condition (divisible by 7). However, in the current problem, the group axioms are inherent to the structure of a group. So the main assumption is that G is a group, and the elements a, b, c are in G, and the equation a∘b = a∘c holds. The rest (associativity, identity, inverses) are properties of the group, but maybe need to be listed as separate assumptions?\n\nWait, the user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So for the group problem, maybe we need to list all the group properties as separate assumptions. Let me check the problem again. The user's question is: \"Prove for a group G, that if a∘b =a∘c then b=c.\" So the problem states that G is a group. Therefore, the assumptions are that G is a group, a, b, c are elements of G, and a∘b = a∘c. The group properties (associativity, identity, inverses) are inherent to the group structure. But according to the example, even if the original problem mentions \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe in this case, we need to list all the necessary properties that are part of the group definition as separate assumptions. Because in the example, the original problem just states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the problem here, the cancellation law is a general group property, so the group structure is the main assumption. But to follow the example, perhaps we need to break down the group properties into individual assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to list only the explicit assumptions given in the problem, not the implicit ones from the definition of a group. The problem states \"for a group G\", so the main assumption is that G is a group, and a, b, c are elements of G, and that a∘b = a∘c. The rest (associativity, identity, inverses) are part of the group definition but not explicitly mentioned. However, the example given by the user included both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). Therefore, perhaps in this case, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. a, b, c are elements of G.\n3. The equation a∘b = a∘c holds in G.\n\nBut the problem is to prove b = c given that. However, the example broke down the problem's assumptions even if they were part of the definition. For instance, in the original problem, the example had \"A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n)\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the user just said \"for every integer n\", so why did the formatted assumption include \"n is divisible by 7\"? Wait, looking back, maybe the example was modified. Wait, the original example had the problem being to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n, so why the assumption n divisible by 7? That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the original problem was for n divisible by 7? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumption, it lists n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. So maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user wanted to highlight that even though the problem states \"for every integer n\", the key assumption is n divisible by 7. But that doesn't align. Wait, 91 is 7*13. If the original problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption says n divisible by 7, that would be incorrect. So perhaps the example is flawed. But regardless, following the user's instructions, they want to structure the problem with assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem: How to prove $b=c$ if $ab=ac$ (cancellation law in groups)?\n\nThe problem is in a group G, if a∘b = a∘c, then b = c.\n\nThe assumptions here are:\n\n1. G is a group under the operation ∘.\n2. a, b, c are elements of G.\n3. The equation a∘b = a∘c holds in G.\n\nBut since a group has certain properties, perhaps we need to break down the group axioms as separate assumptions. For example:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. The operation ∘ is associative in G.\n3. There exists an identity element e in G.\n4. Every element in G has an inverse in G.\n5. a, b, c are elements of G.\n6. The equation a∘b = a∘c holds.\n\nBut the original problem states \"for a group G\", so perhaps the first assumption is G is a group, and the rest are properties inherent to groups. But according to the example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe we need to list all the group properties as separate assumptions. However, in the example, the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the key is that each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. So for the cancellation law, the necessary assumptions would be:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. a is an element of G.\n3. b is an element of G.\n4. c is an element of G.\n5. The equation a∘b = a∘c holds in G.\n\nBut then the group axioms (associativity, identity, inverses) are part of G being a group. However, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7, which might not be in the original problem's statement. But if the example is correct, perhaps the assumptions should list all necessary conditions, even those implied by the definitions. Alternatively, perhaps the example's original problem had a typo, and the actual correct assumptions should be that n is an integer, but the user included an extra condition.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps for the current problem, since it's about groups, the key assumptions are that G is a group, a, b, c are in G, and a∘b = a∘c. The rest (like existence of inverse) are part of the group structure. But according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and another condition. So perhaps the user wants to break down all the conditions, even if they are part of definitions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, and the intended formatting is to list all explicit assumptions from the problem statement, not the implicit ones from definitions. In the original problem here, the user wrote: \"for a group G\", so the main assumption is that G is a group, and that a∘b = a∘c. The elements a, b, c are part of the problem's context.\n\nSo, following the example's approach, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumptions list \"n is an integer\" and any specific conditions. But in the group problem, the problem states \"for a group G\", so the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\na, b, c are elements of G,\na∘b = a∘c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that b = c.\n\nBut in the example, they broke down even the divisibility condition, which might not have been explicitly stated. Hmm, the example seems to have a discrepancy. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be just \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps the original problem was miswritten, or the example is incorrect. But assuming the example is correct as per the user's instruction, perhaps they intended that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", but the divisibility by 91 only holds when n is divisible by 7, so the actual assumption is n divisible by 7. But that would mean the original problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the example is a mistake. But since I have to follow the user's example, even if it's flawed, I need to proceed.\n\nGiven that, for the current group problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- a, b, c are elements of G.\n- a∘b = a∘c.\n\nThus, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\na, b, c are elements of G,\na∘b = a∘c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that b = c.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they list specific conditions. But here, since the problem is in the context of group theory, and the group axioms include the necessary properties (like existence of inverse), perhaps we don't need to list them as separate assumptions. The problem is to prove the cancellation law, which uses the inverse of a. But the existence of inverses is part of the group definition. Therefore, the main assumptions are that G is a group, a, b, c are in G, and a∘b = a∘c.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\na, b, c are elements of G,\na∘b = a∘c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that b = c.\n\nBut the example in the user's instruction seems to include even the divisibility condition that may not be in the original problem. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow their structure. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the formatted assumptions include necessary conditions for the proof. For instance, in the example, maybe the problem actually requires n to be divisible by 7, but it was misstated as \"for every integer n\". However, given the information provided, I have to proceed with the given example structure.\n\nIn the current group problem, the key is that in a group, the cancellation law holds. The proof involves multiplying both sides by the inverse of a. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group (which includes closure, associativity, identity, inverses).\n- a, b, c are elements of G.\n- a∘b = a∘c.\n\nBut since the group structure includes the existence of inverses, associativity, etc., we don't need to list them separately unless specified. However, following the example, where even the basic condition (n is an integer) is listed as an assumption, maybe we need to break down the group's properties.\n\nBut that would be excessive. For example, the group axioms are:\n\n1. Closure: For all a, b in G, a∘b is in G.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, (a∘b)∘c = a∘(b∘c).\n3. Identity element: There exists e in G such that for all a in G, a∘e = e∘a = a.\n4. Inverses: For each a in G, there exists an element a⁻¹ in G such that a∘a⁻¹ = a⁻¹∘a = e.\n\nIf we list all these as assumptions, it would be redundant because the problem states that G is a group. Therefore, the correct approach is to list the main assumption that G is a group, and the other contextual elements (a, b, c being elements of G and the equation a∘b = a∘c). The group axioms are part of G being a group and don't need to be listed individually unless the problem explicitly requires them. However, in the user's example, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem's general statement. This suggests that perhaps the user wants to include specific conditions necessary for the proof, even if they are not explicitly stated in the problem.\n\nBut in the cancellation law problem, the proof requires using the inverse of a, which exists because G is a group. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- a, b, c are elements of G.\n- a∘b = a∘c.\n\nThese are the necessary assumptions. The rest are part of the group structure. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\na, b, c are elements of G,\na∘b = a∘c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that b = c.\n\nThis aligns with the example's structure where the main assumptions are listed, even if they are part of the problem's general statement. The example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", so similarly here, listing \"G is a group\" and \"a, b, c are elements of G\" as assumptions.",
