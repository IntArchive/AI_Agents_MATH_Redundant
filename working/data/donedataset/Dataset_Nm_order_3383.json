    "Content": "Hello all mathematicians!! Again, I am struggling with solving the exercises in Lebesgue Integral for preparing the quiz. At this moment, I and my friend are handling this problem, but both of us agreed this problem is a bit tricky.\nThe problem is following. Let ($X,\\mathcal{A},\\mu$) be a measure space and suppose $\\mu$ is $\\sigma$-finite. Suppose $f$ is integrable. Prove that given $\\epsilon$ there exist $\\delta$ such that $$\n\\int_A |f(x)|\\mu(dx) \\;\\;<\\;\\;\\epsilon\n$$ whenever $\\mu(A) < \\delta$. Could anybody give some good idea for us? Think you very much for your suggestion in advance.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. \n\nFirst, the original problem from Math Stack Exchange: The user needs to prove that for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that the integral of |f(x)| over A is less than ε whenever μ(A) < δ. The measure space is σ-finite, and f is integrable.\n\nLooking at the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So I need to extract all the given conditions. \n\nThe problem mentions a measure space (X, 𝒜, μ) which is σ-finite. Then f is integrable. The goal is to show the ε-δ condition for the integral over sets of measure less than δ.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions:\n1. (X, 𝒜, μ) is a measure space.\n2. μ is σ-finite.\n3. f is integrable (so ∫|f| dμ is finite).\n4. The problem states \"given ε\", so the assumption is ε > 0.\n5. The conclusion requires finding δ > 0 such that for any A with μ(A) < δ, the integral is less than ε.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions include only the given conditions, not the conclusion. So in the original problem, the user's assumptions are the measure space being σ-finite and f being integrable. The problem is to prove the ε-δ statement. The σ-finiteness is part of the measure space's property. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- (X, 𝒜, μ) is a measure space.\n- μ is σ-finite.\n- f is integrable (i.e., ∫_X |f| dμ < ∞).\n- ε is a positive real number.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"given ε\", so ε is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The problem is to find δ depending on ε. So maybe the assumptions are just the first three: measure space is σ-finite, f is integrable. Then the problem is to show for every ε >0, there exists δ>0 such that if μ(A) < δ, then the integral over A is < ε.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included n being an integer and n divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. So in that case, the assumptions were the conditions given on the variables. Here, the given conditions are the measure space is σ-finite, f is integrable. The σ-finiteness is part of the measure space. So the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n(X, 𝒜, μ) is a measure space,\nμ is σ-finite,\nf is integrable.\n\nProblem: Prove that for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all A ∈ 𝒜, if μ(A) < δ, then ∫_A |f(x)| μ(dx) < ε.\n\nBut the original problem statement in the user's example didn't include ε in the assumptions. So following the example, the assumptions are the given conditions on the objects (measure space, μ being σ-finite, f integrable). The problem is the statement to prove, which includes the ε-δ condition.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n(X, 𝒜, μ) is a measure space,\nμ is σ-finite,\nf is integrable.\n\nProblem: Prove that for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that ∫_A |f(x)| μ(dx) < ε whenever μ(A) < δ.\n\nThat seems right. The σ-finiteness is an important condition here because the problem might use decomposition into finite measure sets. Also, integrability of f is crucial for absolute continuity of the integral, which is what this problem is about. The example given in the user's initial prompt had assumptions split into separate lines, each about one object. Here, three separate assumptions: measure space, σ-finite, f integrable. The problem is to prove the ε-δ condition. So I think that's the correct structure.",
