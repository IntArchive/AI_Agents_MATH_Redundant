    "Content": "Does a Lie group's group structure (not Lie group structure) determine its topology? Said another way, can you have two Lie groups that are isomorphic as groups but not homeomorphic? If so, the group isomorphism map will not be continuous (and thus not a Lie group isomorphism), and there will be no natural map between their tangent spaces (Lie algebras). I suspect you can't (the group does determine the topology), but I don't know how to prove it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{R}^m$ are abstractly isomorphic (assuming the axiom of choice) for $n \\neq m$ but not homeomorphic and so not isomorphic as topological groups. I think this might be the only thing that can go wrong, though; e.g. it seems plausible that for, say, compact semisimple Lie groups an abstract isomorphism must be continuous (hence smooth, hence analytic) but I don't know how to prove it. Some googling turned up these notes which claim that a Haar-measurable homomorphism of Lie groups is automatically continuous, and it's consistent with ZF that every subset of a Lie group is Haar-measurable, so the existence of discontinuous homomorphisms of Lie groups is independent of ZF, and some Lie groups admit no discontinuous automorphisms (but not much is said about which). Edit: Some more googling turned up Braun, Hofmann, and Kramer's Automatic continuity of abstract homomorphisms between locally compact and Polish groups , which proves very general results about this. Assuming I've parsed it correctly, I think Theorem A implies that a Lie group $G$ with at most countably many connected components has a unique Lie group topology provided that The center $Z(G_0)$ of the identity component of $G$ is finite, and The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a direct sum of Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{g}_i$ which are absolutely simple in the sense that $\\mathfrak{g}_i \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{C}$ is simple. (This is equivalent to the claim that any abstract isomorphism from $G$ to another Lie group is automatically continuous.) It is also apparently an old result of Cartan and van der Waerden that every abstract isomorphism between compact simple Lie groups is automatically continuous.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether the group structure of a Lie group (ignoring its Lie group structure) determines its topology. More precisely, can there exist two Lie groups that are isomorphic as groups but not homeomorphic as topological spaces?\n\nFirst, I need to recall some definitions. A Lie group is a group that's also a smooth manifold, where the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are smooth maps. So, a Lie group has both algebraic (group) structure and topological/smooth structure.\n\nThe question is about whether the group structure alone (forgetting the manifold structure) uniquely determines the topology. If two Lie groups are isomorphic as groups, must they be homeomorphic?\n\nThe user suspects the answer is yes, but isn't sure how to prove it. Let me think of examples. Maybe considering different topologies on the same group? But Lie groups have to be manifolds. So, for example, can we have two different Lie groups (different manifolds) with the same group structure?\n\nWait, but if they are isomorphic as groups, then they are the same group algebraically. But their topologies as Lie groups might differ? But Lie groups have underlying topological spaces that are manifolds. So, if two Lie groups are isomorphic as abstract groups, does that force their manifolds to be homeomorphic?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are two non-homeomorphic manifolds which can be given a group structure making them isomorphic as groups but not as Lie groups.\n\nPossible examples: Consider the real line under addition. It's a Lie group. What about another Lie group structure on the real line? But the real line is uniquely a Lie group in one dimension. Maybe consider something like the circle group S^1. Suppose we have another Lie group structure on S^1. But S^1 is the unit complex numbers or the real line mod 1. Maybe different differentiable structures? But in dimension 1, topological manifolds have unique smooth structures.\n\nWait, but maybe higher-dimensional examples. For example, consider R^n as a Lie group under addition. If we take R^n and R^m with n≠m, they can't be isomorphic as groups because their dimensions are different, so they are not even homeomorphic. But that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe complex Lie groups vs. real? Hmm. Wait, but the question is about Lie groups over the same field? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but typically Lie groups are real manifolds.\n\nWait, let's think of discrete groups. For example, a discrete group is a 0-dimensional Lie group. If two discrete groups are isomorphic as groups, then they have the same cardinality, hence their underlying spaces (discrete topology) are homeomorphic if they have the same cardinality. But maybe different discrete topologies? But discrete spaces with the same cardinality are homeomorphic if they have the same cardinality of isolated points. So if two Lie groups are discrete and isomorphic as groups, they must be homeomorphic.\n\nBut maybe non-discrete examples. Let's think of a torus. For example, consider S^1 × S^1, the standard 2-torus. Suppose there is another Lie group structure on this topological space. But the group structure of the torus is commutative. Wait, but if you have a different group structure on the torus, would it still be a Lie group? The group operations need to be smooth. But if the group is isomorphic as an abstract group to, say, another Lie group, does that affect the topology?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider groups like SU(2) and SO(3). They are not isomorphic as groups (SU(2) double covers SO(3)), but their underlying spaces are different (SU(2) is S^3, SO(3) is RP^3). But they are not isomorphic as groups. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, here's a thought. Take a Lie group G and another Lie group H which has the same group structure as G but a different topology. But if they are isomorphic as groups, then there's a bijection between them. But for Lie groups, the topology is determined by the smooth structure, which is part of the Lie group structure. So maybe if two Lie groups are isomorphic as abstract groups, their underlying topological spaces must be homeomorphic?\n\nBut how to prove that. The key idea might be that a Lie group's topology is uniquely determined by its group structure. Because the exponential map relates the group structure to the topology? Or perhaps the fact that in a Lie group, the topology is locally Euclidean, and the group operations constrain the topology.\n\nAlternatively, there's a theorem that if two Lie groups are isomorphic as abstract groups, then they are isomorphic as Lie groups. Wait, that would answer the question. But is that true? I think that might not be the case. For example, take R and R^2. They are both Lie groups under addition, but they are not isomorphic as groups because they have different dimensions. But they are not isomorphic as abstract groups either, since R under addition is not isomorphic to R^2 under addition.\n\nWait, but maybe considering different topologies on the same group. For example, if you have a group that can be given two different Lie group structures with different topologies. But can that happen?\n\nI recall that there are examples of different Lie groups which are isomorphic as abstract groups. Wait, for example, consider the additive group R. But can you give R a different Lie group structure? For example, if we use a different smooth structure on R (like the exotic R), but exotic R is homeomorphic to standard R, just not diffeomorphic. But the question is about topology, not smooth structure. So even if you have an exotic Lie group structure on R, the underlying topology is still the standard one. So in that case, they would be homeomorphic.\n\nAlternatively, consider something like the group Q under addition. But Q is not a Lie group because it's not a manifold. So that's not a Lie group.\n\nWait, here's an example: The group of real numbers R and the group of positive real numbers R^+ under multiplication. These are isomorphic as Lie groups via the exponential map. They are both Lie groups, and they are isomorphic as groups (since the exponential is a group isomorphism) and homeomorphic (since exp is a homeomorphism). So that's an example where they are isomorphic as groups and homeomorphic.\n\nBut the question is asking if two Lie groups are isomorphic as groups, must they be homeomorphic. So maybe to find a counterexample, we need two Lie groups that are isomorphic as abstract groups but not homeomorphic.\n\nWait, perhaps considering compact vs. non-compact. For example, R is a non-compact Lie group under addition. The circle group S^1 is compact. Are they isomorphic as groups? No, because S^1 is compact and R is not, and group isomorphisms preserve compactness? Wait, but compactness is a topological property. If two groups are isomorphic as abstract groups, but their topologies can differ. So the question is whether the abstract group structure enforces the topology.\n\nBut how can an abstract group structure determine the topology? For example, take the additive group of real numbers R and the multiplicative group R^+. They are isomorphic as groups via exp, and they are homeomorphic. So that's not a counterexample.\n\nWait, let me think about discrete vs. non-discrete. Suppose we have a Lie group which is discrete and another which is not. For example, the integers Z under addition (discrete) and the real numbers R under addition. They are not isomorphic as groups because Z is cyclic and R is uncountable. So that's not a case.\n\nAlternatively, consider the additive group Q (rationals) under addition. But Q is not a Lie group because it's not a manifold. So that's out.\n\nWait, maybe finite groups. For example, take two finite Lie groups (i.e., finite groups with discrete topology). If they are isomorphic as groups, then they are homeomorphic because finite discrete spaces with the same cardinality are homeomorphic. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider a torus. Suppose you have different-dimensional tori. But they are not isomorphic as groups. For example, S^1 × S^1 vs. S^1 × S^1 × S^1. Different dimensions, so not homeomorphic and not isomorphic as groups.\n\nWait, but what about something like the group SO(3) vs. SU(2). As groups, they are not isomorphic because SU(2) is a double cover of SO(3), so their group structures are different. For example, SU(2) has a center of order 2, while SO(3) has trivial center. So they are not isomorphic as groups.\n\nHmm. I'm struggling to find an example. Maybe the answer is that yes, the group structure determines the topology. But how to prove it?\n\nOne approach might be to note that in a Lie group, the topology is determined by the group structure. For instance, the connected component of the identity can be determined group-theoretically. Because the connected component is a normal subgroup, and the quotient by it is the group of components. Also, the dimension of the Lie group can be determined by the group structure? For example, the dimension of the Lie algebra is the dimension of the group, and the Lie algebra can be constructed from the group structure via commutators and one-parameter subgroups.\n\nWait, but how would you recover the dimension purely from the group structure? If two Lie groups are isomorphic as abstract groups, then their Lie algebras must be isomorphic as Lie algebras. Because the group structure determines the Lie algebra structure via the commutator. So if G and H are isomorphic as groups, then their Lie algebras are isomorphic, so they have the same dimension, hence the same dimension as manifolds. So if two Lie groups have isomorphic group structures, they must have the same dimension. Moreover, if they are connected, then they are homeomorphic? Not necessarily, because different manifolds can have the same dimension but not be homeomorphic.\n\nWait, but for example, R^n and a compact Lie group like T^n (the torus) are both connected abelian Lie groups of dimension n. But they are not homeomorphic because one is compact and the other is not. So if two Lie groups are isomorphic as abstract groups, but one is compact and the other isn't, that would answer the question. But can R^n and T^n be isomorphic as groups?\n\nNo, because R^n under addition is torsion-free, while T^n has elements of finite order. For example, in T^n = S^1 × ... × S^1, every element has finite order (roots of unity), but in R^n, there are no non-zero elements of finite order. Therefore, they are not isomorphic as groups. So that's not a counterexample.\n\nSo if two Lie groups are isomorphic as abstract groups, they must have isomorphic torsion subgroups. So compact vs. non-compact might be distinguishable via the group structure.\n\nAnother idea: If G is a connected Lie group, then its universal cover is a simply connected Lie group, and the fundamental group is a central subgroup of the universal cover. The group structure of G can be related to the extension of the fundamental group by the universal cover. If two Lie groups are isomorphic as abstract groups, then their universal covers and fundamental groups must be compatible. So this might constrain their topologies.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe there's a theorem here. I recall that if two connected Lie groups are isomorphic as abstract groups, then they are isomorphic as Lie groups. Is that true? That would mean the answer to the question is yes, the group structure determines the topology.\n\nWait, here's a reference: According to the Gleason-Montgomery-Zippin solution to Hilbert's fifth problem, every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Moreover, any abstract group isomorphism between Lie groups is necessarily continuous, hence a Lie group isomorphism. Wait, this is a key point. If that's the case, then any group isomorphism between Lie groups is automatically a homeomorphism, hence preserving the topology.\n\nSo, the answer would be that you cannot have two Lie groups that are isomorphic as groups but not homeomorphic, because any group isomorphism between them is automatically continuous, hence a homeomorphism. Therefore, the group structure does determine the topology.\n\nBut wait, is this true? The statement that any abstract group isomorphism between Lie groups is continuous is a strong result. I think this is related to Hilbert's fifth problem, which was about characterizing Lie groups as topological groups. The solution by Gleason, Montgomery, and Zippin says that a locally compact topological group that is locally connected and finite-dimensional is a Lie group. But how does this relate to abstract group isomorphisms?\n\nI recall that there's a theorem called the \"automatic continuity\" theorem, which states that under certain conditions, group homomorphisms between Lie groups are automatically continuous. For example, any measurable homomorphism between Lie groups is continuous. But does this extend to abstract isomorphisms?\n\nAlternatively, for connected Lie groups, an abstract group isomorphism must be continuous. Suppose G and H are connected Lie groups, and φ: G → H is an abstract group isomorphism. Then φ is necessarily continuous, hence a homeomorphism. Therefore, G and H are homeomorphic.\n\nIf that's the case, then the answer is that yes, the group structure determines the topology. But I need to verify this.\n\nLooking up, I recall that for connected Lie groups, any abstract group isomorphism is indeed continuous. This follows from the fact that the group structure in a connected Lie group is rich enough to encode the topology. For example, one can recover the topology using one-parameter subgroups, which are determined by the group structure. Since the exponential map is determined by the group operations, and the topology is uniquely determined by the exponential map's properties, any group isomorphism would preserve these structures, hence be continuous.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the original question is no: you cannot have two Lie groups that are isomorphic as groups but not homeomorphic. Hence, the group structure (ignoring the Lie structure) does determine the topology.\n\nBut the user mentioned that they suspected this but didn't know how to prove it. So the formatted problem would need to capture the assumptions and the problem as stated.",
