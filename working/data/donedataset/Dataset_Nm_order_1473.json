    "Content": "Greets This is a problem I wanted to solve for a long time, and finally did some days ago. So I want to ask people here at MSE to show as many different answers to this problem as possible. I will offer a Bounty in two days, depending on the interest in the problem, and eventually increase it as it gets more voted. Of course, I will show my answer to this question to know whether it is correct. Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\newcommand{\\cl}{\\operatorname{cl}}$ Theorem. Let $\\langle X,\\tau,\\le\\rangle$ be a LOTS; then $X$ is $T_5$ . Proof. Let $H$ and $K$ be separated subsets of $X$ . For each $x\\in H$ there is a convex $V_x\\in\\tau$ such that $x\\in V_x\\subseteq X\\setminus K$ , and for each $x\\in K$ there is a convex $V_x\\in\\tau$ such that $x\\in V_x\\subseteq X\\setminus H$ . Let $V_H=\\bigcup_{x\\in H}V_x$ and $V_K=\\bigcup_{x\\in K}V_x$ ; clearly $H\\subseteq V_H$ , $K\\subseteq V_K$ , and $V_H\\cap V_K\\subseteq X\\setminus(H\\cup K)$ . Let $V=V_H\\cap V_K$ . If $V=\\varnothing$ , we’re done, so suppose that $V\\ne\\varnothing$ . Define a relation $\\sim$ on $V$ by $p\\sim q$ iff $\\left[\\min\\{p,q\\},\\max\\{p,q\\}\\right]\\subseteq V$ ; it’s easily verified that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are the order-components of $V$ . Let $T\\subseteq V$ contain exactly one point of each $\\sim$ -class. Suppose that $x\\in H$ , and $p,q\\in V_x\\cap T$ with $p<q$ ; I’ll show that $p<x<q$ . Suppose that $x<p$ . Since $p\\in T\\subseteq V$ , there is a $y\\in K$ such that $p\\in V_y$ ; $[x,q]\\subseteq V_x\\subseteq X\\setminus K$ , so $y\\notin[x,q]$ . If $y<x$ , then $x\\in[y,p]\\subseteq V_y\\cap H=\\varnothing$ , so $x<p<q<y$ . But then $[p,q]\\subseteq V_x\\cap V_y\\subseteq V$ , so $p\\sim q$ , contradicting the choice of $p$ and $q$ and showing that $p<x$ . A similar argument shows that $x<q$ . Similarly, if $x\\in K$ and $p,q\\in V_x\\cap T$ with $p<q$ , then $p<x<q$ . Note that it follows immediately that $|V_x\\cap T|\\le 2$ for all $x\\in H\\cup K$ . Now fix $p\\in T$ . Let $H_p=\\{x\\in H:p\\in V_x\\}$ and $K_p=\\{x\\in K:p\\in V_x\\}$ ; $H_p\\ne\\varnothing\\ne K_p$ , since $p\\in V$ . Suppose that $x<p$ for some $x\\in H_p$ . If $y\\in K_p$ and $y<p$ , then either $x<y$ and $y\\in V_x$ , or $y<x$ and $x\\in V_y$ , since the sets $V_x$ and $V_y$ are convex; neither is possible, so $p<y$ , and since $y\\in K_p$ was arbitrary, $p<K_p$ . A similar argument then shows that $H_p<p$ and hence $H_p<p<K_p$ . If instead $p<x$ for some $x\\in H_p$ , it follows similarly that $K_p<p<H_p$ . For each $x\\in H\\cup K$ define $W_x\\in\\tau$ as follows: $$W_x=\\begin{cases}V_x,&\\text{if }V_x\\cap T=\\varnothing\\\\V_x\\cap(p,\\to),&\\text{if }V_x\\cap T=\\{p\\}\\text{ and }p<x\\\\V_x\\cap(\\leftarrow,p),&\\text{if }V_x\\cap T=\\{p\\}\\text{ and }x<p\\\\V_x\\cap(p,q),&\\text{if }V_x\\cap T=\\{p,q\\}\\text{ and }p<x<q\\;.\\end{cases}$$ Let $$W_H=\\bigcup_{x\\in H}W_x\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad W_K=\\bigcup_{x\\in K}W_x\\;;$$ clearly $W_H$ and $W_K$ are open, $H\\subseteq W_H$ , and $K\\subseteq W_K$ , and I claim that $W_H\\cap W_K=\\varnothing$ . Suppose not; then there are $x\\in H$ and $y\\in K$ such that $W_x\\cap W_y\\ne\\varnothing$ ; without loss of generality suppose that $x<y$ . Fix $q\\in W_x\\cap W_y$ ; it’s not hard to see that $x<q<y$ , since $W_x$ and $W_y$ are convex. Moreover, $q\\in V$ , so $q\\sim p$ for a unique $p\\in T$ . Let $I$ be the closed interval with endpoints $p$ and $q$ . Then $I\\subseteq V\\subseteq X\\setminus(H\\cup K)$ , so $x,y\\notin I$ , and therefore $x<p<y$ . If $p\\le q$ , then $p\\in W_x\\cap T\\subseteq V_x\\cap T$ , and by construction $W_x\\subseteq(\\leftarrow,p)$ , and $p\\notin W_x$ , a contradiction. If, on the other hand, $q\\le p$ , then $p\\in W_y\\cap T\\subseteq V_y\\cap T$ , so that $W_y\\subseteq(p,\\to)$ , and $p\\notin W_y$ , which is again a contradiction, and it follows that $W_H\\cap W_K=\\varnothing$ . $\\dashv$ Despite the sometimes finicky details, the idea of the argument is very simple. $V$ is the intersection of the open nbhds $V_H$ and $V_K$ of $H$ and $K$ , respectively. It’s open, so we partition it into its open order-components. If $C$ is one of these components, let $H_C=\\{x\\in H:V_x\\cap C\\ne\\varnothing\\}$ and $K_C=\\{x\\in K:V_x\\cap C\\ne\\varnothing\\}$ ; we show that either $H_C<C<K_C$ or $K_C<C<H_C$ . Then we pick a point $p$ in $C$ and contract the intervals $V_x$ that meet $C$ by intersecting them with $(\\leftarrow,p)$ for $x<C$ and with $(p,\\to)$ for $C<x$ . This contraction removes $C$ from the intersection of the nbhds of $H$ and $K$ , and since we do it simultaneously for all components $C$ , we end up with disjoint nbhds $W_H$ and $W_K$ of $H$ and $K$ . As an immediate consequence we get that every LOTS $X$ is hereditarily normal: disjoint closed sets in a subspace of $X$ are separated sets in $X$ . Thus, we have for free that every GO-space (generalized ordered space) is hereditarily normal. Moreover, the argument is very easily modified to show that if $\\mathscr{F}$ is a separated family of subsets of $X$ , meaning that $F\\cap\\cl\\bigcup(\\mathscr{F}\\setminus\\{F\\})=\\varnothing$ for each $F\\in\\mathscr{F}$ , then there is a pairwise disjoint family $\\mathscr{U}=\\{U_F:F\\in\\mathscr{F}\\}$ of open sets in $X$ such that $F\\subseteq U_F$ for each $F\\in\\mathscr{F}$ , i.e., that $X$ is hereditarily collectionwise normal .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave involved breaking down the assumptions and the problem statement clearly.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Then the problem statement was to prove the divisibility. So the key here is to extract all the conditions each applied to one object.\n\nNow, the problem presented here is titled \"Why are ordered spaces normal? [collecting proofs]\" and the question is asking for different proofs. The user wants the assumptions and the problem statement structured.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the assumptions are for ordered spaces being normal. Ordered spaces, or linearly ordered topological spaces (LOTS), have certain properties. The main assumptions would relate to the definition of an ordered space. So, in topology, an ordered space is a set with a linear order and the order topology. The normality of such spaces is a known result, so the assumptions would be that the space is an ordered space (i.e., has the order topology induced by a linear order). \n\nBut wait, does the problem mention any specific conditions beyond being an ordered space? The original question just says \"ordered spaces normal,\" so the main assumption is that the space is an ordered space. Since normality is a property that might require certain conditions, but in the case of LOTS, the order topology itself makes it normal. So the assumption here is that the space is a linearly ordered topological space. \n\nTherefore, in the assumption section, it should list that the space is a linearly ordered topological space. That's the primary condition. Are there other assumptions? The problem doesn't mention any specific restrictions like being a continuum, or connected, etc. So it's just the general case of ordered spaces. \n\nSo the problem is to prove that ordered spaces (LOTS) are normal. The user is collecting different proofs for this result. Therefore, structuring it:\n\nAssumption: The space is equipped with a linear order,\nAssumption: The topology is the order topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that the ordered space is normal.\n\nWait, in the example, each assumption is a single line addressing one property. So here, \"the space is a linearly ordered topological space\" can be split into two parts: having a linear order and having the order topology. But maybe in the context of ordered spaces, it's considered a single assumption. Alternatively, in topology, an ordered space is defined as a set with a linear order and the order topology. So perhaps the assumption is just \"The space is a linearly ordered topological space.\" But according to the example, they split even the same object's properties. For example, \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So maybe here, the two parts: linear order and order topology should be separate. Let me check standard definitions. A linearly ordered topological space (LOTS) is a set with a linear order and the topology generated by the open intervals from that order. So the two components are the linear order and the topology generated by it. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The space has a linear order.\n2. The topology on the space is the order topology induced by the linear order.\n\nTherefore, each of these is a separate assumption. So the user's example split the properties of the same object (n being integer and divisible by 7), so in this case, the two properties (linear order and order topology) are separate conditions, each applied to the space.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is equipped with a linear order,\nThe topology on the space is the order topology induced by the linear order.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the ordered space is normal.\n\nYes, that seems right. The problem is asking why ordered spaces are normal, so the assumptions are that it's a LOTS, and the problem is to prove normality.",
