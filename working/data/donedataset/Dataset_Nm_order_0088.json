    "Content": "It seems it's well known that if a sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets, then the cardinality of it is either finite or $c$ (the cardinality of continuum). But it seems hard to prove it, and actually hard to find a proof of it. Can anyone help me out?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's say the $\\sigma$-algebra on $X$ is generated by the sets $A_i \\subseteq X$.  For each subset $I$ of the natural numbers, consider the set $B_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} A_i \\cap \\bigcap_{i \\notin I} (X \\setminus A_i)$.  For distinct sets $I$ and $J$, the corresponding sets $B_I$ and $B_J$ are disjoint.  Now take cases: either only finitely many of the $B_I$ are nonempty, or infinitely many are.  This will show that the $\\sigma$-algebra is either finite or has cardinality at least that of the continuum. To show that the $\\sigma$-algebra cannot have cardinality strictly above that of the continuum is a bit more involved.  I can't come up with an approach avoiding transfinite induction up the Borel hierarchy.  Here's a sketch of what I have in mind: We build an increasing family $S_\\alpha$ of subsets of the power set of $X$, as $\\alpha$ ranges over the countable ordinals.  In the end, $\\bigcup_{\\alpha < \\omega_1} S_\\alpha$ will be a $\\sigma$-algebra of size at most continuum containing our countably many generators (in fact, it will be the $\\sigma$-algebra they generate, but that's just an added bonus).  We start by setting $S_0$ to equal the (countable) set of generators.  Given $S_\\alpha$, we let $S_{\\alpha+1}$ be the collection of subsets which can be written as countable unions of the form $\\bigcup_i A_i \\cup \\bigcup_j (X \\setminus B_j)$, where $A_i$ and $B_j$ are chosen from $S_\\alpha$.  Note that if $|S_\\alpha| \\leq 2^{\\aleph_0}$, then $|S_{\\alpha+1}| \\leq 2^{\\aleph_0}$ as well (since there are only continuum many choices of ways to write the union: this is essentially the cardinal equality $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$).  For limit ordinals $\\lambda$, let $S_\\lambda = \\bigcup_{\\alpha < \\lambda} S_\\alpha$.  This will again satisfy $|S_\\lambda| \\leq 2^{\\aleph_0}$ provided each $S_\\alpha$ in the union does. Finally, we see $\\bigcup_{\\alpha<\\omega_1} S_\\alpha$ has cardinality at most that of the continuum, since $\\aleph_1 \\cdot 2^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.  Moreover, it is closed under the $\\sigma$-algebra operations since any countable sequence of elements is accounted for in some $S_\\alpha$ (with $\\alpha < \\omega_1$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is talking about the cardinality of the Borel sigma algebra. They mention that if a sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets, then its cardinality is either finite or the cardinality of the continuum. They find this fact hard to prove and are asking for help in finding a proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are that the sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets. So the main assumption is that the sigma algebra is countably generated. The problem is to determine the cardinality of such a sigma algebra, showing it's either finite or has the cardinality of the continuum (which is 2^aleph0, or c).\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the user had to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So here, the sigma algebra is generated by a countable collection of sets. That's one assumption. Then, perhaps the problem is to show that its cardinality is either finite or c. But the user also mentions it's \"well-known\" but hard to prove. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"if a sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets, then the cardinality of it is either finite or c\". So the assumptions would be: the sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets. But perhaps there's another implicit assumption here? For example, the sigma algebra is on a standard measurable space, like the real numbers? Wait, but the Borel sigma algebra is specifically mentioned in the title, but in the question body, the user generalizes to any sigma algebra generated by countably many sets. Hmm, maybe the title is a bit different from the body. The title says \"Cardinality of Borel sigma algebra\", but the question body talks about any sigma algebra generated by countably many sets. So perhaps the problem is more general. However, the user might be conflating two things: the Borel sigma algebra, which is countably generated, and the general case of countably generated sigma algebras. But the problem as stated in the body is about sigma algebras generated by countably many sets, not necessarily Borel. However, in the title, they mention Borel specifically. Wait, but the problem in the body says \"if a sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets, then the cardinality...\" So perhaps the main assumption is that the sigma algebra is countably generated. So the problem is to prove that such a sigma algebra has cardinality either finite or c. So the assumptions would be: The sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets. But maybe we need to check if there's another assumption. For example, the underlying space maybe needs to be a standard Borel space? Or is this for any space? But the problem as stated in the question doesn't specify any particular space, so maybe the only assumption is that the sigma algebra is countably generated. However, the example given in the original problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the user's problem may only have one assumption. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets.\nProblem: Prove that the cardinality of the sigma algebra is either finite or equal to the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nBut wait, the title mentions \"Borel sigma algebra\", but the body is more general. So perhaps the user is referring to the Borel sigma algebra on a topological space, which is generated by open sets. But the question in the body is about any sigma algebra generated by countably many sets. Maybe the user is confused between Borel sigma algebras and countably generated sigma algebras in general. But according to the problem statement in the body, the sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets. So perhaps the title is a bit misleading, but the actual problem is about countably generated sigma algebras. Therefore, the correct assumption is that the sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets, and the problem is to prove its cardinality is finite or c. Alternatively, maybe the user is specifically asking about the Borel sigma algebra, which is a particular case. But the Borel sigma algebra on a space like the real line is generated by countably many sets if the space is second countable. Wait, the real line's Borel sigma algebra is generated by the open intervals with rational endpoints, which are countable. So the Borel sigma algebra is countably generated. Therefore, the problem could be about Borel sigma algebras, which are countably generated, and their cardinality. However, the user's question in the body seems to generalize to any countably generated sigma algebra. Hmm. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"It seems it's well known that if a sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets, then the cardinality of it is either finite or c (the cardinality of continuum). But it seems hard to prove it, and actually hard to find a proof of it. Can anyone help me out?\"\n\nSo the user is definitely talking about sigma algebras generated by countably many sets, not necessarily Borel. The title mentions \"Borel sigma algebra\", but the body is more general. Therefore, the problem is about countably generated sigma algebras. So the assumption is that the sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets, and the problem is to prove its cardinality is either finite or c. Therefore, the formatted answer would be:\n\nAssumption: The sigma algebra is generated by countably many sets.\nProblem: Prove that the cardinality of the sigma algebra is either finite or equal to the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nBut maybe the user made a mistake in the title, and the problem is specifically about Borel sigma algebra. However, according to the body, it's about countably generated sigma algebras. So the answer should follow the body's problem. Hence, the formatted problem as per the user's example would have the assumption listed as the sigma algebra being countably generated, and the problem to prove the cardinality is finite or c.",
