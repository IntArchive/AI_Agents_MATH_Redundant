    "Content": "This should be a very easy question but it might just be that I'm confusing myself. So we have the definition of a function $f$ on $S$ being continuous at $x_0$: For any $\\epsilon$>0, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that: whenever $|x-x_0|<\\delta$, we have $|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\\epsilon$ And I assume the negation is There exists $\\epsilon$>0 such that for all $\\delta>0$, $|x-x_0|<\\delta$ yet $|f(x)-f(x_0)|\\ge \\epsilon$. Now I want to show that the function $f(x)=\\sin(\\frac{1}{x})$ together with $f(0)=0$ cannot be made into a continuous function at $x=0$. So I need to show that there exists $\\epsilon>0$ such that for all $\\delta>0$, $|x|<\\delta$ yet $|f(x)|\\ge\\epsilon$. Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}$. Then no matter what $\\delta$ we choose, let $|x|<\\frac{1}{2}$. It is certainly possible that $|f(x)|\\ge \\frac{1}{2}$, because, well, $\\frac{1}{x}$ can really take on arbitrarily large value as $x$ is small. Now, what confuses me is that, as $x$ gets small, $f(x)$ can certainly be greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$ for infinitely many times, but it will be less than that infinitely many times, too. But I suppose it doesn't really matter. So I think there's something wrong with my negation but I couldn't figure out where. Update: The correct version can be found here . Watch for Lemma 4.6",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The negation is: There exists $ϵ>0$ such that for all $δ>0$, there is an $x_\\delta$ such that $ |x_\\delta−x_0|<δ$ yet $|f(x_\\delta)−f(x_0)|≥ϵ$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The example they gave includes listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about the negation of the definition of continuity and applying it to show that f(x) = sin(1/x) with f(0)=0 can't be made continuous at x=0. The user is confused about their negation and their approach to proving it.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem and extract the assumptions. The key elements here are:\n\n1. The function f is defined as sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = 0.\n2. The problem is to show that this function cannot be made continuous at x=0.\n3. The user attempted the negation of the continuity definition, which they state as: There exists ε>0 such that for all δ>0, |x - x0| < δ yet |f(x) - f(x0)| ≥ ε. In this case, x0 is 0.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include the definition of the function f, the point of interest (x=0), and the negation conditions. But each assumption should be a single line addressing one property. Let me list them:\n\n- f is defined as f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\n- f(0) = 0,\n- The continuity of f is considered at x₀ = 0,\n- The negation of continuity requires the existence of ε > 0 such that for all δ > 0, there exists an x with |x - x₀| < δ and |f(x) - f(x₀)| ≥ ε.\n\nWait, the user's negation had \"for all δ>0, |x - x0| < δ yet |f(x) - f(x0)| ≥ ε\". But technically, the correct negation is: there exists ε > 0 such that for all δ > 0, there exists an x such that |x - x0| < δ and |f(x) - f(x0)| ≥ ε. The user might have missed the \"there exists x\" part, which is crucial. However, in their problem statement, they mention showing \"there exists ε>0 such that for all δ>0, |x| < δ yet |f(x)| ≥ ε\". So they might have omitted the existence of such x in each δ neighborhood.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, should we include the correct negation as an assumption or the user's version? The user is confused about their negation, thinking maybe it's wrong, but the problem is to apply the correct negation to show f can't be continuous at 0. The function's definition is essential here. So the assumptions should include the definition of f, the point of continuity considered (x=0), and the criteria for discontinuity (the negation). But since the user is working through their understanding of the negation, maybe we need to structure the problem based on their attempt but also correct it.\n\nWait, the example given by the user included the original problem's assumptions and the problem statement. So in this case, the original problem is about the negation of continuity and applying it to f(x)=sin(1/x) with f(0)=0. The assumptions would be:\n\n- f is defined on S (though S isn't specified, but likely the real line),\n- f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\n- f(0) = 0,\n- Continuity is considered at x₀ = 0,\n- The negation of continuity at x₀ is defined as the existence of ε > 0 such that for all δ > 0, there exists x with |x - x₀| < δ and |f(x) - f(x₀)| ≥ ε.\n\nBut the user's problem is to show that this function cannot be made continuous at x=0, which requires using the negation. So structuring the problem, the assumptions would be about the function's definition and the point of interest, and the problem is to show discontinuity via the negation.\n\nBut the user's confusion comes from their initial negation missing the \"there exists x\" part, but in their problem statement, they say \"for all δ>0, |x| < δ yet |f(x)| ≥ ε\". They might have conflated universal and existential quantifiers. However, the correct negation would require that for each δ, there exists an x within δ of x₀ where |f(x) - f(x₀)| ≥ ε.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- Function f is defined as f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\n- f(0) = 0,\n- The problem considers continuity of f at x₀ = 0.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that f cannot be made continuous at 0, which involves showing the negation of the continuity definition holds. But perhaps the problem statement should be framed as applying the negation to this specific function.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the assumptions included the conditions on n and the problem statement was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Similarly here, the assumptions are the function's definition and the point of continuity, and the problem is to show that f isn't continuous there (using the negation).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is defined as f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\n- f(0) = 0,\n- Continuity of f is considered at x₀ = 0,\n- The negation of continuity at x₀ requires the existence of ε > 0 such that for all δ > 0, there exists x with |x - x₀| < δ and |f(x) - f(x₀)| ≥ ε.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f cannot be made continuous at x = 0.\n\nBut wait, the user's original question is more about the process of forming the correct negation and applying it. The actual problem they need to solve is to use the negation to prove discontinuity. However, the example given by the user included a problem statement that's a direct quote, so perhaps in this case, the problem should be exactly what the user is asking: showing that f can't be made continuous at 0 by using the negation.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included the conditions on n (like n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about the function's definition and the negation's structure.\n\nWait, but the original problem is the user's own problem, not the example. Let me check the exact original problem from the user:\n\nThe user provided the Math Stack Exchange question titled \"Negation of definition of continuity\", and the content is the user's question about their confusion with the negation and applying it to f(x)=sin(1/x) with f(0)=0.\n\nThe user's formatted example took the original problem's mathematical statement and listed the assumptions. So in this case, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is to prove the statement.\n\nSo in the given example, the user had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the current case, the original problem is about the function f(x)=sin(1/x) with f(0)=0, and the task is to show it can't be made continuous at 0. The assumptions here are the definition of f and the conditions for continuity negation.\n\nBut the user's problem in their question is about verifying their negation approach and correcting it. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which includes listing assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include the definition of f, the point of interest (x=0), and possibly the structure of the negation as per the user's attempt. However, the example didn't include the method of proof as an assumption, just the conditions on the objects involved.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is defined as f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\n- f(0) = 0,\n- Continuity is considered at x₀ = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f cannot be made into a continuous function at x = 0.\n\nBut wait, the user's confusion is about the negation of the continuity definition. In their problem statement, they tried to use ε=1/2 and argue that no matter δ, there's x with |x| < δ and |f(x)| ≥ 1/2. But they note that while f(x) can be ≥1/2 infinitely often, it's also <1/2 infinitely often. So their approach might be flawed because the negation requires that for some ε>0, for every δ>0, there exists x within δ of 0 with |f(x)| ≥ ε. So if they can find such an ε where this holds, then the negation is satisfied. The user's choice of ε=1/2 might work because sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1, so for any δ>0, there are x near 0 where sin(1/x)=1 or -1, which would be ≥1/2. Wait, but 1 is ≥1/2, so even though there are points where it's less than 1/2, the existence of at least one x in each δ neighborhood where it's ≥1/2 would suffice.\n\nSo the problem is to show that for ε=1/2, for any δ>0, there exists x with |x| < δ and |sin(1/x)| ≥1/2.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are about the function's definition and the point of continuity. The problem is to apply the negation of continuity to show discontinuity at 0.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is defined as f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\n- f(0) = 0,\n- The continuity of f is considered at x₀ = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists ε > 0 such that for all δ > 0, there exists x with |x| < δ and |f(x)| ≥ ε, thereby proving f is not continuous at 0.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement should be concise, like \"Prove that ...\". The original example had the problem as the original statement. So here, the problem would be to prove that f cannot be made continuous at 0, using the negation.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's question is about their confusion in applying the negation, the problem might be phrased as: \"Prove that the function f(x) = sin(1/x) with f(0)=0 is not continuous at x=0 by showing the negation of the continuity definition holds.\"\n\nBut following the example's structure, the problem is stated as the original request, and the assumptions are the conditions given. So in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with assumptions on n.\n\nSimilarly, here, the problem is to show f is not continuous at 0, with assumptions being the function's definition and the point of interest.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- f(x) = sin(1/x) for x ≠ 0,\n- f(0) = 0,\n- The continuity of f is considered at x₀ = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f cannot be made into a continuous function at x = 0.\n\nBut to align with the example, where the problem includes the mathematical expression, maybe we need to include the definition of f in the problem statement. However, the example included the mathematical expression directly in the problem. In this case, the problem statement is to show discontinuity, and the assumptions include the function's definition.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement could be written as:\n\nProve that the function $$f(x) = \\begin{cases} \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) & \\text{if } x \\neq 0, \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x = 0 \\end{cases}$$ is not continuous at $x = 0$.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is stated concisely, and the assumptions are listed separately. Therefore, the function definition is split into assumptions.\n\nSo the correct formatted version would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$ for $x \\neq 0$,\n$f(0) = 0$,\nContinuity of $f$ is considered at $x_0 = 0$.\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ cannot be made into a continuous function at $x = 0$.\n###",
