    "Content": "This math problem was posted on The Nineteenth Byte over at Programming Puzzles and Code Golf . It states this: Prove that for all integers $n > 0, 2^n$ will contain a digit other than $1$ and $0$ in base $5$. TNB came up with these conditions for a counterexample: $2^n \\text{ mod } 5 = 1$ ; $2^n \\text{ mod } 10 = 6$ ; and $n \\text{ mod } 4 = 0$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We assume it can be written as $N=5^{a_i} + 5^{a_{i-1}} +・・・+ 5^{a_1} + 1$ Since this equal to $2^n$. Let $n=4m$, $2^{n}-1$\n$=16^{m}-1$\n$=(3*5+1)^m-1 $\n$=(3*5)^m+・・・+m(m-1)/2*(3*5)^2+5*3m$ It must be $3m=5^{b_1}=1$, or $5^{b_1}+1$. $9m(m-1)/2$ must be $5^{b_2},5^{b_2}+1$. So possible case are two. $(i)$  $5^{b_1}*3(m-1)/2=5^{b_2}+1$ this leads $-5^{b_2-b_1}=2,b_1=0$. This is false. $(ii)$ $9m(m-1)/2=5^{b_2}+1$ $⇔(5^{b_1}+1)*(5^{b_1}-2)=2(5^{b_2}+1)$ $-2 \\not \\equiv2 \\mod 5 $ This is a contradiction. Therefore it was proved there are no $2^n$ of base 5 which is made of only $0$ and $1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions are broken down into individual points per line, each addressing one property of a single object.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The title is: \"2^n base 5 contains more than ones and zeros?\" The problem states that for all integers n > 0, 2^n in base 5 will have a digit other than 0 or 1. Then, TNB came up with conditions for a counterexample: 2^n mod 5 = 1, 2^n mod 10 = 6, and n mod 4 = 0.\n\nWait, the original problem is to prove that for all n > 0, 2^n in base 5 has a digit other than 0 or 1. The user provided some conditions that a counterexample must satisfy. So these conditions are part of the problem's context but not the problem itself. The assumptions should list the conditions given for a potential counterexample.\n\nSo the assumptions are the three conditions mentioned: 2^n mod 5 = 1, 2^n mod 10 = 6, and n mod 4 = 0. Each of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove the original statement, but maybe the user is asking to show that if these conditions are met, then it's a counterexample? Wait, no. The original problem is to prove that no such n exists, so the problem as stated is the original one. The conditions are the necessary criteria for a counterexample. But according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the problem is to prove that for all n > 0, 2^n in base 5 has a digit other than 0 or 1. The conditions given (2^n mod 5 =1, etc.) are the necessary conditions for a counterexample. However, in the example, the problem's assumptions were part of the problem's setup, like n being an integer. Here, perhaps the problem is the original statement, and the assumptions are the conditions given for the counterexample. Wait, but the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake. Wait, no. Let me check the example again. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem lists as assumptions \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumptions include that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That must be a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is wrong. But the user is providing that example. So perhaps in that example, the problem was actually to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so there's a discrepancy. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user is following that structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is a hypothetical where the problem was modified. So, given that the user wants to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the problem statement, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are the conditions mentioned for the counterexample, even though those are part of the context. Wait, the problem is to prove that for all n > 0, 2^n in base 5 has a digit other than 0 or 1. The user's question from Math Stack Exchange mentions that TNB came up with conditions for a counterexample: 2^n mod5=1, 2^n mod10=6, n mod4=0. So perhaps the problem here is to prove that these conditions cannot be satisfied, thereby proving the original statement. Alternatively, the problem might be to show that if these conditions are met, then 2^n in base5 has only 0s and 1s, but since the original problem is to prove that no such n exists, maybe the problem is to show that these conditions lead to a contradiction. However, the user's instruction is to structure the problem as per the example, which in the example took the original problem and extracted assumptions. But in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps in the example, maybe the original problem had a typo, or the user intended to modify the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but since I need to follow the user's example, I should proceed accordingly. So, given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are the conditions given for a counterexample, and the problem is to prove the original statement. But the example's structure seems to take the problem and list the assumptions that are given in the problem. Wait, maybe the original example's problem was modified by adding an assumption. For instance, perhaps the original problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n divisible by 7,\" but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". That would make sense. However, in the example given, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would mean that the user might have a mistake in their example. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they want to structure the problem by including all the conditions mentioned in the problem's context as assumptions. Therefore, in the current problem, the conditions given by TNB (2^n mod5=1, 2^n mod10=6, n mod4=0) are the assumptions, and the problem is the original one. But perhaps the problem as structured is to show that these conditions cannot hold, or to use them to prove the original statement. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that if these conditions hold, then 2^n in base5 has only 0 and 1. But that would be the converse. The original problem is to show that for all n >0, 2^n in base5 has a digit other than 0 or 1, so any counterexample would need to satisfy those conditions. Therefore, the problem as presented in the formatted version would have the assumptions being those three conditions, and the problem would be to prove that there exists no n satisfying those, hence proving the original statement. But the user's example structured the problem with assumptions, then the problem statement. So in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem includes assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but if the original problem was for every integer n, then the assumption should just be n is an integer. Adding that n is divisible by 7 would narrow the problem. So perhaps there's an error in the example. But regardless, the user wants me to follow their example structure. So in this case, the original problem is to prove that for all n >0, 2^n in base5 has a digit other than 0 and 1. The conditions given for a counterexample are 2^n ≡1 mod5, 2^n ≡6 mod10, and n ≡0 mod4. So perhaps the problem as formatted would list these three conditions as assumptions, and the problem would be to prove that 2^n in base5 contains a digit other than 0 and 1. Alternatively, the problem might be to show that these conditions lead to a contradiction. But according to the user's example, the problem is the original statement, and the assumptions are the conditions given. So the formatted problem would list the three conditions as assumptions, and the problem would be the original statement. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n divisible by7. That seems like the problem was changed to \"Prove for n divisible by7\", but the original problem was for every integer. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but following that, in the current problem, the assumptions would be the three conditions for a counterexample, and the problem is to prove that 2^n in base5 has a digit other than 0 and1. But that doesn't make sense, because if the assumptions are the conditions for a counterexample, then the problem would be to show that those assumptions lead to a contradiction. Alternatively, the problem is to prove that if these conditions hold, then 2^n in base5 contains only 0 and1, but the original problem is the opposite. This is confusing. Maybe the user intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem's context, which are the necessary conditions for a counterexample. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be those three conditions, and the problem would be to show that even under these conditions, 2^n in base5 still has a digit other than 0 or1. But the original problem is for all n>0, so perhaps the problem is to show that even when those conditions are met, there's still a non-0/1 digit, thereby proving no counterexample exists. Therefore, structuring the problem as: Assumptions are the three conditions, problem is to prove that 2^n in base5 contains a digit other than 0 and1. But that might not align with the example. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that there exists no n>0 satisfying those three assumptions, thereby proving the original statement. But the user's example structured the problem by including the assumptions as part of the problem's conditions. For example, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by7. So perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions mentioned in the problem's context as assumptions. In the current problem, the problem's context mentions the three conditions for a counterexample. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would be those three conditions, and the problem is to prove that 2^n in base5 contains a digit other than 0 and1. But in reality, if those three conditions are met, then 2^n in base5 would be a counterexample. So the actual problem is to show that no such n exists, i.e., there's no n>0 satisfying all three assumptions. Therefore, the problem would be to prove that there is no integer n>0 satisfying all three assumptions. But the original problem is to prove that for all n>0, 2^n in base5 has a non-0/1 digit. So proving that no n satisfies the three assumptions would contribute to that. However, the user's example seems to have taken the original problem's conclusion and made it the problem, with added assumptions. But given the ambiguity, I think the correct approach here is to list the three conditions as assumptions and the problem as the original statement. Alternatively, the problem could be to show that these three conditions cannot all hold, hence no counterexample exists. But the original problem is more general. The user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by7), so perhaps the formatted problem here should list the three conditions as assumptions and the problem as proving the original statement under those assumptions. But that's not exactly accurate. Wait, the original problem is to prove for all n>0, 2^n in base5 contains a non-0/1 digit. The conditions given are necessary for a counterexample. Therefore, to prove the original statement, one approach is to show that no n satisfies all three conditions, meaning no counterexample exists. Therefore, the problem could be structured as: Assumptions: the three conditions; Problem: Prove that no such n exists (i.e., there is no integer n>0 satisfying all three assumptions). But the original problem is more general. However, according to the example, the formatted problem took the original problem's conclusion and added an assumption. So in the example, the original problem's conclusion was that A(n) is divisible by91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem's assumptions included that n is divisible by7. But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the example was intended to assume n is divisible by7 to make A(n) divisible by91. But the example is unclear. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, the formatted problem should list the three conditions as assumptions and the problem as the original statement. So the assumptions would be:\n\n2^n mod5=1,\n\n2^n mod10=6,\n\nn mod4=0.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2^n in base5 contains a digit other than 0 and1.\n\nBut that seems off because under those assumptions, 2^n would be a counterexample. So perhaps the problem is to show that even if these assumptions hold, 2^n in base5 still has a non-0/1 digit. Or that no such n exists. But the original problem is to show for all n>0, so if we can show that no n satisfies all three assumptions, then there is no counterexample. Therefore, the problem would be to prove that there is no integer n>0 satisfying all three assumptions. But how does that fit into the user's example? In their example, the problem was to prove divisibility by91 under the assumption that n is divisible by7. So perhaps here, the problem is to prove the original statement (2^n in base5 has non-0/1 digit) under the assumptions that n satisfies the three conditions. But that's circular. Alternatively, the problem is to show that if those three conditions hold, then 2^n in base5 must have a non-0/1 digit, which would contradict the possibility of a counterexample. But that seems more logical. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n$2^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$,\n\n$2^n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}$,\n\n$n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $2^n$ contains a digit other than $1$ and $0$ in base $5$.\n\nBut wait, under these assumptions, if 2^n in base5 has only 0s and 1s, then it would be a counterexample. So the problem is to show that even if these assumptions hold, 2^n in base5 still has another digit. That would indeed prove the original statement. So the problem is structured with those three assumptions and the original problem's conclusion. Therefore, the formatted problem would list those three conditions as assumptions and the problem as proving the base5 representation has non-0/1 digits. Therefore, the answer would be as above.",
