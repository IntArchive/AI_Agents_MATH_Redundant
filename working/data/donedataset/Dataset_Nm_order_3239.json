    "Content": "Let $A$ be an invertible real matrix, and suppose that $(A^{-1})_{i,j} = (A^{T})_{i,j}$ whenever $(A^{T})_{i,j}\\ne 0$ . Is it true that $A$ is orthogonal? I found this statement in a paper without proof. The converse is true for obvious reasons. Trying to write $AA^{-1} =  A^{-1}A= I$ one can find that $A$ has all columns and rows of unitary norm, but not much more. This is sadly not enough to conclude that $A$ is orthogonal (there are explicit counterexamples).\nCan you help? For those who asked, notice that for all $i,j$ , $$(A^{-1})_{i,j}(A)_{j,i} = (A^{-1})_{i,j}(A^{T})_{i,j} = (A^{T})^2_{i,j}$$ so $$1 = (A^{-1}A)_{i,i} = \\sum_j (A^{-1})_{i,j}(A)_{j,i} = \\sum_j (A^{T})^2_{i,j}$$ meaning that the norm of any column of $A$ is 1. From $AA^{-1}=I$ you get that also the norm of the rows is 1.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your claim is false.  Let $$A=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}0&-1&-1\\\\-1&0&-1\\\\-1&-1&0\\end{bmatrix}$$ Then $A$ is self-adjoint and $A^{-1}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}I_3+A$ , so that $A^{-1}=A^{\\mathsf{T}}$ except where the entries of the latter vanish. I found this just by asking Mathematica to search for a $3\\times3$ counterexample; there's no insight to it.  On the other hand, Mathematica doesn't think there are any $3\\times3$ counterexamples with determinant $1$ .  Perhaps you misinterpreted the paper or dropped a condition?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and structure it according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, so I need to be precise and careful.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about whether an invertible real matrix A is orthogonal if the inverse of A equals the transpose of A on all nonzero elements of the transpose. The user mentions that they found this in a paper without proof and that the converse is obviously true. They also tried working through some matrix multiplications and found that the columns and rows have unit norm but that's not sufficient. There's a counterexample where that's not enough for orthogonality.\n\nSo, the task is to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections. Let me break down the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. A is an invertible real matrix. That's one assumption.\n2. The inverse of A, specifically each entry (A^{-1})_{i,j}, is equal to the transpose entry (A^T)_{i,j} whenever (A^T)_{i,j} is not zero. So this is another condition applied to A.\n\nThe problem then is to determine if under these assumptions, A must be orthogonal. So orthogonal means that A^T = A^{-1}, which would mean that every entry of A^T is equal to A^{-1}, not just the non-zero ones. But here, the equality is only required where the transpose has non-zero entries. So the question is whether this conditional equality is enough to force A to be orthogonal.\n\nNow, the example provided in the user's initial example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, the assumptions are about the matrix A. Let me check if there's any other implicit assumption. The user mentions that A is invertible, which is given. The other condition is on the entries of the inverse and transpose. So I think the two assumptions are:\n\n- A is an invertible real matrix.\n- For all i, j, (A^{-1})_{i,j} = (A^T)_{i,j} whenever (A^T)_{i,j} ≠ 0.\n\nThe problem is to prove that A is orthogonal. But wait, the problem statement in the original question is \"Is it true that A is orthogonal?\" So in the formatted problem, the problem would be phrased as \"Prove that A is orthogonal\" or \"Is it true that A is orthogonal? Prove or disprove.\" But since the original question is asking if it's true, maybe the problem should be stated as a question. However, the example given in the user's initial example turned the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. The original question here is phrased as \"Is it true that A is orthogonal?\" but according to the example, maybe it's better to phrase it as \"Prove that A is orthogonal\" if the answer is yes, or leave it as a question if unsure. However, the user might want the problem structured as a statement to prove, assuming the answer is yes. But since the original problem is a question, perhaps the problem part should be \"Is it true that A is orthogonal?\" But in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem was also \"Prove that...\". The user's example converted the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" even though the original problem's assumptions might have had an extra condition (like n divisible by 7). Here, the user is asking whether the given conditions imply orthogonality.\n\nWait, the original question in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, which required an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the user is presenting the question as \"Is it true that A is orthogonal?\" given the conditions on the inverse and transpose entries where the transpose entries are non-zero. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nLooking at the example's assumptions:\n\nAssumptions were:\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo here, the problem is to prove a statement under the given assumptions. Similarly, in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is an invertible real matrix.\n- For all i, j, (A^{-1})_{i,j} = (A^T)_{i,j} whenever (A^T)_{i,j} ≠ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is orthogonal.\n\nBut the original question was phrased as \"Is it true that A is orthogonal?\" So maybe the problem should be \"Is it true that A is orthogonal?\" However, the example turned a question into a \"Prove that...\", perhaps because the answer is affirmative. The user here is asking for help in proving or disproving, but the problem structure in the example is to state it as a \"Prove that...\". Since the user mentions that in their attempts they found that rows and columns have unit norm but that's not enough, but the paper's statement claims it's true. So maybe the problem is to prove that under these conditions, A is orthogonal.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are as I listed, and the problem is to prove that A is orthogonal. The user's own attempt shows that the columns and rows have norm 1, but there's a worry that's not enough. The key here is that the equality of inverse and transpose on non-zero entries, combined with invertibility, might force the matrix to be orthogonal.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is an invertible real matrix.\n- For all i, j, (A^{-1})_{i,j} = (A^T)_{i,j} whenever (A^T)_{i,j} ≠ 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A is orthogonal.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"An invertible matrix is orthogonal if and only if the inverse is equal to the transpose on nonzero elements\". So the title is asserting an if and only if, but the question is about the \"if\" direction: given that the inverse equals the transpose on non-zero elements, is the matrix orthogonal? The converse is obvious, as the user says.\n\nSo in the problem statement, the user is asking to prove that if A is invertible and the inverse equals the transpose on all non-zero entries of the transpose, then A is orthogonal. Therefore, the problem is to prove that A is orthogonal under those two assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted version should have two assumptions and the problem as stated. I think that's correct.",
