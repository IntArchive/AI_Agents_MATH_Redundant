    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the integral of e^(x²) from 0 to 1 is between 1.462 and 1.463. They already managed the lower bound using Taylor series up to x¹⁰. Now they need the upper bound.\n\nFirst, I need to check the assumptions. The problem states it's a high school problem, so methods should be within that scope. The integral is from 0 to 1, and the function is e^(x²). The user used Taylor expansion for the lower bound, truncating the series after the x¹⁰ term. Since e^(x²) is the sum from n=0 to ∞ of x^(2n)/n!, using a finite number of terms gives an underestimate because all the remaining terms are positive. Therefore, integrating the polynomial up to x¹⁰ gives a value less than the actual integral, which is how they got 1.4625 as a lower bound.\n\nFor the upper bound, they need a method that provides an overestimate. One common approach is to use the remainder of the Taylor series. The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from k=0 to ∞ of y^k/k!. If we truncate at some term, the remainder can be bounded. For example, if we take up to y^m/m!, the remainder R_m(y) is the sum from k=m+1 to ∞ of y^k/k!. Since e^y is an increasing function, the remainder can be bounded by something like (y^(m+1)/(m+1)!) * e^y, but I need to recall the exact form of the remainder in Taylor series.\n\nAlternatively, since e^(x²) is convex on [0,1], maybe using the trapezoidal rule or another approximation method that overestimates the integral. But since it's a high school problem, probably sticking to Taylor series is better.\n\nWait, the user mentioned they used the Taylor expansion for the lower bound. For the upper bound, they might need to consider that the remainder after truncating the Taylor series is positive, so if they can bound that remainder, they can add it to the polynomial approximation to get an upper bound.\n\nLet me think. Let’s denote T_n(x) as the Taylor polynomial of e^(x²) up to degree 2n. Then, the integral of T_n(x) from 0 to 1 would be less than the actual integral. To get an upper bound, they need to find a value that's larger than the integral. One way is to note that the remainder term for the Taylor series of e^y is R_n(y) = y^(n+1)/(n+1)! * e^c for some c between 0 and y. Since y = x² here, which is between 0 and 1, so c ≤ 1. Therefore, the remainder after the nth term is bounded by (x²)^(n+1)/(n+1)! * e^1. So integrating that from 0 to 1 would give a bound on the error term.\n\nFor example, if they used up to x¹⁰ term (which is the 5th term since each term is x²k), then n=5. The remainder R_5(x²) would be sum from k=6 to ∞ of x²k /k!. But integrating that sum is the same as integrating the remainder. Since each term x²k /k! is positive, the remainder is less than the sum from k=6 to ∞ of 1/k! (since x ≤1, x²k ≤1). Therefore, the remainder integral would be less than sum from k=6 to ∞ of 1/(k!*(2k+1)) ). Wait, integrating x²k from 0 to1 is 1/(2k+1). So the total error after integrating the Taylor polynomial up to k=5 would be sum from k=6 to ∞ of 1/(k!*(2k+1)). Let's compute that:\n\nFor k=6: 1/(6! *13) = 1/(720*13) ≈ 1/9360 ≈0.0001068\n\nk=7: 1/(5040*15)≈1/75600≈0.0000132\n\nk=8: 1/(40320*17)≈1/685440≈0.00000146\n\nAdding these up: approx 0.0001068 +0.0000132 +0.00000146 ≈0.0001215. The higher terms are negligible. So total error is about 0.0001215. Therefore, the upper bound would be the lower bound (1.4625) plus the error (≈0.0001215), giving ≈1.4626215, which is still below 1.463. Wait, but the user wants to prove the integral is ≤1.463. If their lower bound is 1.4625 and the error term is about 0.00012, then adding gives 1.46262, which is still less than 1.463. So maybe this approach is sufficient. But the problem states to prove up to 1.463, so maybe a coarser upper bound is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a simpler method is to use a substitution or inequality. For example, since x² ≤x on [0,1], because x ≤1, so x² ≤x. Therefore, e^{x²} ≤e^x. Then integrating from 0 to1 gives ∫₀¹ e^x dx = e -1 ≈1.718, which is way larger than 1.463. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, find a function that is always above e^{x²} on [0,1]. Maybe a tangent line or convex function property. Since e^{x²} is convex, the trapezoidal rule would overestimate the integral. The trapezoidal approximation using the endpoints: (f(0)+f(1))/2 *1 = (1 + e)/2 ≈ (1 +2.718)/2 ≈1.859, which is also too big.\n\nAlternatively, use a polynomial that majorizes e^{x²}. For example, knowing that e^{x²} = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^{2n}/n!, so if we take a partial sum plus a bound on the remainder. Let's say up to n=5 (x^{10}/120) as before, and then bound the remainder by a geometric series. For x in [0,1], x^{12}/6! +x^{14}/7! +... < x^{12}/6! (1 + x²/(7) +x^4/(7*8) +...) < 1/720 * sum_{k=0}^∞ (1/7)^k ) =1/(720*(1-1/7)) =1/(720*(6/7))=7/(4320)≈0.00162. Then integrating the remainder would be less than 0.00162. So the upper bound would be the integral of the polynomial up to x^{10} (1.4625) plus 0.00162≈1.46412, which is slightly above 1.463. Hmm, that's over the desired upper bound. So maybe this approach isn't tight enough.\n\nAlternatively, use more terms of the Taylor series. Suppose we take more terms before bounding the remainder. For example, take up to x^{12}/12! term. But this might complicate the calculation for high school students.\n\nAlternatively, consider that e^{x²} ≤1 +x² +x^4/2 +x^6/6 +x^8/24 +x^{10}/120 +x^{12}/720 + ... up to some term and then bound the remainder. Wait, but even taking more terms would make the approximation better, but how to get an upper bound?\n\nAlternatively, use the inequality e^{x²} ≤1 +x² +x^4/2 +x^6/6 +x^8/24 +x^{10}/120 + ... and note that this is actually the series itself. Wait, no, that's the equality. To get an upper bound, maybe compare to a geometric series. For example, for k ≥6, the terms x^{2k}/k! ≤1/k! because x≤1. So the remainder after the 5th term (x^{10}/120) is sum_{k=6}^∞ x^{2k}/k! ≤sum_{k=6}^∞ 1/k! ≈1/720 +1/5040 +...≈0.001615 as before. Therefore, integrating from 0 to1, the remainder is ≤0.001615. Then total integral ≤1.4625 +0.001615≈1.464115, which is about 1.4641, still exceeding 1.463. So this method gives an upper bound higher than needed.\n\nBut the problem wants to show it's ≤1.463. Therefore, maybe this approach isn't sufficient, and we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: Use substitution. Let t =x^2, so x=√t, dx=1/(2√t) dt. Then ∫₀¹ e^{x²} dx = ∫₀¹ e^t/(2√t) dt. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that e^{x²} is increasing, so on each subinterval [a,b], the integral is ≤(b-a)*e^{b²}. If we partition [0,1] into smaller intervals and sum up. For example, using a Riemann sum with right endpoints. The more partitions, the better the approximation. Let's try with n=5 intervals. Each of width 0.2. The right endpoints are 0.2,0.4,...,1.0. Then the upper sum would be 0.2*(e^{0.04} + e^{0.16} + e^{0.36} + e^{0.64} + e^{1.0}). Compute each term:\n\ne^{0.04}≈1.0408\n\ne^{0.16}≈1.1735\n\ne^{0.36}≈1.4333\n\ne^{0.64}≈1.9004\n\ne^{1.0}=2.7183\n\nSum≈1.0408 +1.1735=2.2143; +1.4333=3.6476; +1.9004=5.548; +2.7183=8.2663\n\nMultiply by 0.2: 8.2663*0.2≈1.65326, which is way over 1.463. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe using more intervals. For example, n=10. Each width 0.1. Right endpoints: 0.1,0.2,...,1.0.\n\nCompute sum of e^{x²} at x=0.1 to1.0:\n\ne^{0.01}≈1.01005\n\ne^{0.04}≈1.04081\n\ne^{0.09}≈1.09417\n\ne^{0.16}≈1.17351\n\ne^{0.25}≈1.28403\n\ne^{0.36}≈1.43333\n\ne^{0.49}≈1.63232\n\ne^{0.64}≈1.90042\n\ne^{0.81}≈2.24791\n\ne^{1.00}≈2.71828\n\nSum≈1.01005 +1.04081=2.05086; +1.09417=3.14503; +1.17351=4.31854; +1.28403=5.60257; +1.43333=7.0359; +1.63232=8.66822; +1.90042=10.56864; +2.24791=12.81655; +2.71828=15.53483\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 1.553483. Still over 1.53. Hmm, too high.\n\nAlternatively, use the midpoint rule? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Use the inequality e^{x²} ≤1 +x² +x^4/2 +x^6/6 +x^8/24 +x^{10}/120 +x^{12}/720 +... but actually, this is equality. So to get an upper bound, you need to find a series that is term-by-term larger. Maybe by noting that the remainder after k terms is positive, but that doesn't help for upper bound.\n\nWait, maybe use a Padé approximant. But that might be too advanced.\n\nAlternatively, compare to another function that's integrable and larger. For example, since x² ≤x in [0,1], but as before, e^{x²} ≤e^x which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, split the integral into two parts: from 0 to a and a to1, where a is chosen such that on [a,1], e^{x²} is bounded by a linear function, and on [0,a], use Taylor series.\n\nFor example, choose a=0.8. Then on [0.8,1], e^{x²} is increasing, so e^{x²} ≤e^{1} =e≈2.718. But integrating from 0.8 to1 gives 0.2*e≈0.543, and from 0 to0.8, use Taylor series. But this might not give a tight enough bound.\n\nAlternatively, take more terms in the Taylor series for the lower part. Let's try:\n\nSuppose we split at x=0.5. From 0 to0.5, use a Taylor approximation, and from 0.5 to1, bound e^{x²} by its maximum at x=1, which is e. Then the upper integral would be ∫₀^0.5 e^{x²} dx + ∫_{0.5}^1 e dx.\n\nFirst part: Taylor series up to x^{10} integrated from 0 to0.5. Compute that:\n\nThe integral of 1 +x² +x^4/2 +x^6/6 +x^8/24 +x^{10}/120 from 0 to0.5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n∫1 dx from0 to0.5 =0.5\n\n∫x² dx = [x³/3] from0 to0.5 = (0.125)/3 ≈0.0416667\n\n∫x^4/2 dx = (x^5)/10 from0 to0.5 ≈(0.03125)/10≈0.003125\n\n∫x^6/6 dx = (x^7)/42 from0 to0.5≈(0.0078125)/42≈0.000186\n\n∫x^8/24 dx = (x^9)/216 from0 to0.5≈(0.001953125)/216≈0.00000904\n\n∫x^{10}/120 dx = (x^{11})/(1320) from0 to0.5≈(0.00048828125)/1320≈0.00000037\n\nSum these up: 0.5 +0.0416667≈0.5416667; +0.003125≈0.5447917; +0.000186≈0.5449777; +0.00000904≈0.544986; +0.00000037≈0.544986. So the integral from0 to0.5 using Taylor up to x^{10} is≈0.544986. Then the remainder in the Taylor series for e^{x²} from0 to0.5 is the sum from k=6 to∞ of x^{2k}/k! dx. Each term is positive, so the remainder is positive, but we already integrated up to x^{10}, which corresponds to k=5 (since 2k=10). The next term would be x^{12}/6! etc. To bound the remainder:\n\nFor x in [0,0.5], x^{12}/720 ≤ (0.5)^12 /720 ≈0.00024414/720≈0.000000339. Then integrating from0 to0.5 gives 0.000000339 *0.5≈0.00000017. Similarly, higher terms are negligible. So the actual integral from0 to0.5 is≈0.544986 +0.00000017≈0.544986, which is close to the approximation.\n\nThen the upper integral would be≈0.544986 + ∫_{0.5}^1 e dx =0.544986 + e*(1-0.5)=0.544986 + (2.71828*0.5)=0.544986 +1.35914≈1.9041, which is way over 1.463. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, this approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nThe user wants an upper bound of 1.463. The lower bound they found is 1.4625 using the Taylor polynomial up to x^{10}. The actual value of the integral is known to be approximately 1.46265... So to prove it's ≤1.463, perhaps we can use a slightly better approximation.\n\nWait, if the user already has 1.4625 as a lower bound, and the actual value is≈1.46265, then adding a small epsilon to 1.4625 would reach the upper bound. So maybe the error term after the Taylor polynomial up to x^{10} is small enough.\n\nEarlier computation of the remainder after x^{10} gave an integral error of≈0.00012, so the upper bound would be≈1.4625 +0.00012≈1.46262, which is less than1.463. Therefore, simply stating that the remainder is less than0.00012, which is less than0.00038 (since1.463 -1.4625=0.0005), hence the upper bound holds.\n\nBut wait, the user needs to show the integral is≤1.463. If the remainder after integrating the Taylor polynomial up to x^{10} is less than0.0005, then adding that to1.4625 gives1.463. Therefore, need to show that the remainder is ≤0.0005.\n\nLet me compute the remainder more carefully. The remainder R after the term x^{10}/120 is:\n\nR = ∫₀¹ sum_{k=6}^∞ x^{2k}/k! dx = sum_{k=6}^∞ ∫₀¹ x^{2k}/k! dx = sum_{k=6}^∞ 1/(k!*(2k+1)).\n\nCompute this sum:\n\nFor k=6: 1/(720*13)≈0.0001068\n\nk=7:1/(5040*15)≈0.0000132\n\nk=8:1/(40320*17)≈0.00000146\n\nk=9:1/(362880*19)≈0.000000015\n\nTotal≈0.0001068 +0.0000132 +0.00000146 +0.000000015≈0.0001215.\n\nSo the total remainder is≈0.0001215. Therefore, the upper bound is≈1.4625 +0.0001215≈1.4626215, which is within the desired upper bound of1.463. Hence, the integral is ≤1.4626215 <1.463. Therefore, the upper bound holds.\n\nTherefore, the user can state that after integrating the Taylor polynomial up to x^{10}, the remainder is less than0.0002 (for safety), hence the integral is less than1.4625 +0.0002=1.4627, which is still less than1.463. Therefore, both bounds are proven.\n\nBut the original problem statement in the example didn't mention the divisibility by7 assumption. Wait, in the example given by the user, they included an assumption that n is divisible by7, but in the original problem, that wasn't stated. Wait, no, the example was for a different problem. The current problem is about the integral of e^{x²} from0 to1. The assumptions here are just that the integral is from0 to1 and e^{x²} is the integrand. The problem doesn't have any hidden assumptions beyond what's stated. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to 1,\n\nThe integrand is e^{x²}.\n\nBut since the problem is as stated, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral being over [0,1] and the function being e^{x²}. However, the user's example had an assumption that n is divisible by7, which was not in the original problem. Wait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by91, and in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by7. That seems incorrect. Wait, but maybe that was a mistake in the example. The user wrote:\n\nExample:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by7, which changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user provided a bad example. For the current problem, we shouldn't add assumptions not present.\n\nTherefore, for the current integral inequality problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is taken from 0 to 1.\n\n- The integrand is e^{x²}.\n\nBut those are already clear from the problem statement. The user might want to list any hidden assumptions, but in this case, there are none. The problem is to prove the integral is between 1.462 and1.463, and the user already used Taylor expansion for the lower bound. So the formatted problem should list any necessary assumptions, but since the problem is straightforward, there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's limits and the integrand.\n\nWait, but in the example, they added an assumption not present in the original problem, which seems incorrect. So perhaps the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem statement. In the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n\n- The integrand is e^{x²}.\n\nBut these are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Maybe the user's example was flawed. For the current problem, perhaps there are no separate assumptions, and they should be omitted. However, following the user's format, they expect an \"Assumption\" section. In the example, they included assumptions that weren't in the original problem, which is confusing. But perhaps in the current case, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is computed over the interval [0, 1].\n\nThe function to integrate is e^{x²}.\n\nBut these are part of the problem statement. Alternatively, if there are implicit assumptions, like the function is integrable, but that's too trivial.\n\nAlternatively, since the user mentioned it's a high school problem, the assumptions might be that standard calculus techniques can be used, but that's not mathematical.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are simply restating the components of the problem. So following the example's structure, even if it's redundant:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integrand is e^{x²}.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $$ 1.462 \\le \\int_0^1 e^{x^{2}} \\, dx \\le 1.463$$\n\nBut the original problem already states that, so perhaps the assumptions section is redundant here. However, following the user's format, we list the assumptions line by line. Since the problem is to bound the integral of e^{x²} from0 to1, the assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand. So I'll list them as such.",
