    "AcceptedAnswer": "Integrals of such form (i.e. combination of $\\arctan x, \\log x, \\log(1\\pm x), \\log(1+x^2$ )) have systematic way of calculation. If you randomly write down such an integral, there is likely no slick way. However, for this particular one, there is something behind. Writing $a=\\arctan x, b=\\log(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2})$ , I will simultaneously prove OP's question as well as the following generalizations $$\\begin{aligned}I_3 &= \\color{red}{\\int_0^1 \\frac{12a^2b-b^3}{x} dx = \\frac{9\\pi^4}{16}} \\\\\nI_5 &= \\int_0^1 \\frac{-80 a^4 b+40 a^2 b^3-b^5}{x} dx = \\frac{33 \\pi ^6}{8} \\\\\nI_7 &= \\int_0^1 \\frac{448 a^6 b-560 a^4 b^3+84 a^2 b^5-b^7}{x} dx = \\frac{2193 \\pi ^8}{32} \\end{aligned}$$ Here numerator of $I_n$ is real part of $(2ai-b)^n$ . Write $$I_n=\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\Re[(2ai-b)^n]}{x}dx = -2^n \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\Re[(\\log(1-x)-\\log(1+ix))^n]}{x}dx $$ then for $n$ odd, $\\frac{I_n}{\\pi^{n+1}} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ . More precisely, if $n=2m+1$ , $$\\tag{*}I_n = 2^{2n-2}3\\pi^{n+1}(-1)^{m+1} \\sum_{r=0}^m \\binom{n}{2r+1}\n\\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^{2r}\n\\frac{1}{n-2r}B_{n-2r}\\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)$$ here $B_n(x)$ is Bernoulli polynomial, from which above cited values of $I_n$ follows. Proof of $(*)$ : Integrate $\\frac{(\\log(1-z)-\\log(1+iz))^n}{z}$ around quarter circle in the first quadrant, the integral from $0$ to $i$ is $$\\begin{aligned}2^n \\int_0^i \\frac{(\\log(1-x)-\\log(1+ix))^n}{x}dx &= 2^n \\int_0^1 \\frac{(\\log(1-ix)-\\log(1-x))^n}{x}dx \\\\\n&= -2^n \\int_0^1 \\frac{(\\log(1-x)-\\log(1-ix))^n}{x}dx \\end{aligned}$$ so the real part of $\\int_0^i$ is $-I_n$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original problem is an integral from 0 to 1 of a complicated expression involving arctan squared, logarithms, and so on, all divided by x. The user wants me to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, then state the problem.\n\nFirst, looking at the integral itself: the integrand is a function of x, and the limits are from 0 to 1. So one assumption is that we're integrating over the interval [0,1]. Then, the integrand has arctan(x) squared, which implies that x is a real number in the domain where arctan is defined, which it is between 0 and 1. The logarithm terms have arguments (1-x)^2/(1+x^2) and similar. I need to check if there are any restrictions here. For x in [0,1], (1-x) is between 0 and 1, so (1-x)^2 is positive, and 1+x^2 is always positive. So the arguments inside the logarithms are positive, so the logs are defined. Therefore, another assumption is that the integrand is defined and continuous on (0,1). But maybe the integrand has singularities at the endpoints? At x=0, let's check: arctan(0) is 0, so arctan squared is 0. The logarithm terms: when x approaches 0, (1-x)^2 approaches 1, and 1+x^2 approaches 1, so the log approaches log(1) which is 0. So maybe near x=0, the numerator behaves like 0 - 0, but divided by x. Hmm, need to see the behavior. Similarly at x=1: arctan(1) is π/4, so finite. The log term becomes log(0) as x approaches 1, which would go to negative infinity, but multiplied by arctan squared which is finite. So the integrand might have a logarithmic singularity at x=1. But the problem states to compute the integral, so perhaps assuming it converges? Or maybe the integral is improper but convergent. So maybe the assumptions are that the integral is an improper integral at x=0 and x=1, but converges to the given value. However, according to the example, the assumptions list conditions on the objects in the problem. The example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the key objects are the integrand and the limits. So possible assumptions:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand involves the function arctan(x), which is defined for all real x, including [0,1].\n- The argument of the logarithm, (1−x)^2/(1+x^2), is positive for x ∈ [0,1).\n- The integral is an improper integral at x=1 (since log((1−x)^2/(1+x^2)) becomes log(0) as x approaches 1).\n- The integrand is composed of elementary functions that are integrable over [0,1].\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse:\n\n1. The variable x is in the interval [0,1].\n2. The integrand is defined as (12 arctan²x * ln((1−x)²/(1+x²)) − ln³((1−x)²/(1+x²)))/x.\n3. The integral is an improper integral at x=0 and x=1 (since at x=0, denominator x approaches 0, and numerator approaches 0 as well; at x=1, the logarithm term approaches ln(0) which is -infty, but multiplied by arctan²(1) which is finite. So need to check convergence. But maybe the problem assumes convergence because the user is trying to compute it. However, the example given didn't list convergence as an assumption. Maybe in the original problem, the assumptions are about the variables and functions involved, not about the integral's convergence. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is taken over the interval (0,1).\n- The integrand is a combination of arctan²x, logarithmic functions, and x in the denominator.\n- The argument of the logarithmic function (1−x)²/(1+x²) is positive for x ∈ [0,1).\n\nBut perhaps the key is to list all the necessary conditions that are implicitly assumed for the problem to make sense. The user wants to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line. In the example, they listed that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, which were the conditions given in the original problem. But in the current problem, the original problem doesn't state any explicit conditions; it just presents the integral. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number in the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is defined for all x in (0,1).\n- The integral is an improper integral at x=0 and x=1.\n\nBut I need to see what's necessary. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. So the assumptions were the conditions on n. In the current problem, the integral's integrand is presented without any parameters, so maybe the only assumption is that the integral is over [0,1] and the integrand is as given. But according to the user's example, assumptions are about the objects in the problem. So here, the main objects are the integrand and the integral. So the assumptions could be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand function is defined as [expression given].\n- The integrand is integrable over (0,1).\n\nBut maybe the problem is presented as is, and the user just needs to extract the integral expression and present it. Wait, looking at the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. However, in the original problem, the user had \"Prove that for every integer n... divisible by 91\". Wait, no, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless there was a typo in the original problem. Maybe the original problem had n divisible by 7, but the example says it was to prove for every integer n. So perhaps there's an error in the example. But regardless, following the user's example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is given. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is evaluated over the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is defined as [expression provided].\n\nBut the problem as stated in the question is to compute the integral and prove it equals 9π⁴/16. So maybe the assumptions are just that the integral is taken from 0 to 1, and the integrand is as given. However, in the example, they split the original problem into assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, perhaps the example is a different problem. Let me look again: in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Unless the original problem had a typo. Maybe the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But regardless, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are the conditions necessary for the integral to be valid, which would be:\n\n- x is in the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is defined and integrable over [0,1].\n\nBut since the problem is to compute the integral, perhaps the main assumption is that the integral converges and equals the given value. However, the user's example didn't include convergence as an assumption. It seems like the example's assumption was just the conditions on n.\n\nIn this case, since the problem is purely to compute the integral, and there's no variable like n with conditions, maybe the assumptions are minimal. Let me check the original problem again:\n\n\"Find ∫₀¹ [expression] dx = 9π⁴/16\"\n\nSo the problem is to evaluate that integral and prove it equals that value. The assumptions needed would be that the integral is over [0,1], the integrand is as given, and that the integral converges. However, according to the user's example, the assumptions are about the objects in the problem. Here, the integral is over x from 0 to1, and the integrand involves arctan²x and logs. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The variable x is in the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is composed of arctan²x, logarithmic functions, and x in the denominator.\n- The integral is an improper integral at x=0 and x=1.\n\nBut since the user's example listed two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by7), perhaps here we need to list the necessary mathematical conditions. However, the integral's integrand involves logs and arctan, which are defined on [0,1) except at x=1 where the log term becomes problematic. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is defined for all x in [0,1) with a possible singularity at x=1.\n- The logarithmic terms involve arguments that are positive for x in [0,1).\n\nBut maybe each assumption should be a single line. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number in the interval [0,1].\nThe integrand includes the function arctan(x) squared.\nThe argument of the natural logarithm, (1−x)^2/(1+x^2), is positive for x ∈ [0,1).\nThe integral is improper due to the behavior of the integrand at x=0 and x=1.\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption as a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from x = 0 to x = 1.\nThe integrand contains the term arctan²(x).\nThe integrand contains the logarithm of ((1 - x)² / (1 + x²)).\nThe integrand contains the cube of the logarithm of ((1 - x)² / (1 + x²)).\nThe integrand is divided by x.\n\nBut that's listing components of the integrand. However, the example listed assumptions about the objects (n being integer and divisible by7). Here, since there's no variable like n, maybe the assumptions are about the integral's properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as is, and the assumptions are just restating the components. But I think the key is to list the necessary conditions for the problem to be well-posed. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is integrated from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand is defined as [expression].\nThe integral converges.\n\nBut the problem is to compute the integral, so the user needs to assume it converges. However, the example didn't mention convergence. So maybe the main assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number in [0,1].\n- The integrand is as given.\n- The integral is taken in the Riemann sense (or improper Riemann).\n\nBut the example didn't include such technicalities. Given that the user's example extracted assumptions from the problem statement, here the problem is to compute the integral from 0 to1 of that function. The assumptions needed are the integral bounds and the structure of the integrand, but in the example, they extracted conditions on n. Since there's no variable here, perhaps the assumptions are just the integral limits and that the integrand is as given. But the example split the original problem's conditions into separate lines. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0.\nThe upper limit of integration is 1.\nThe integrand is (12 arctan²x ln((1−x)²/(1+x²)) − ln³((1−x)²/(1+x²)))/x.\n\nBut each line is a single assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from x = 0 to x = 1.\nThe integrand contains 12 arctan²(x) multiplied by the natural logarithm of ((1 - x)² / (1 + x²)).\nThe integrand subtracts the cube of the natural logarithm of ((1 - x)² / (1 + x²)).\nThe integrand is divided by x.\n\nAlternatively, more concise:\n\nAssumption:\nIntegration is performed over the interval [0, 1].\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{12\\arctan^2 x \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right) - \\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right)}{x}\\).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken with respect to x from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand includes the term \\(12\\arctan^2(x)\\).\nThe integrand includes the term \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right)\\).\nThe integrand includes the term \\(\\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right)\\).\nThe integrand is divided by x.\n\nBut maybe that's too granular. Alternatively, since the integrand is a single expression, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral to evaluate is \\(\\int_0^1 \\frac{12\\arctan^2 x \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right) - \\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right)}{x} \\, dx\\).\n\nBut the example split the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Unless there was a miscommunication in the example.\n\nAssuming that the example is correct, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed, even if they're implicit. In the current problem, the integral is from 0 to1, and the integrand is defined as given. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\nThe integrand is defined as \\(\\frac{12\\arctan^2(x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right) - \\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right)}{x}\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals \\(\\frac{9\\pi^4}{16}\\).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is integrated from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand contains the function \\(12\\arctan^2(x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right)\\).\nThe integrand subtracts the term \\(\\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right)\\).\nThe entire expression is divided by x.\n\nBut this might be splitting hairs. Alternatively, the integrand's expression is a single term, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral to compute is \\(\\int_0^1 \\frac{12\\arctan^2 x \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right) - \\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right)}{x} \\, dx\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals \\(\\frac{9 \\pi^4}{16}\\).\n\nBut the example split the assumptions into two lines, even though the original problem had \"for every integer n\". So in the example, the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the integral's assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integration variable x ranges from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{12\\arctan^2(x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right) - \\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right)}{x}\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals \\(\\frac{9\\pi^4}{16}\\).\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"x ranges from 0 to1\" is one assumption. Then, each part of the integrand. But maybe not. Let's see:\n\nThe example's first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", second \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, for the integral, the first assumption is the integral bounds, then the integrand's components. But the integrand is a single expression, so maybe it's one assumption. But in the example, they split the original problem's conditions into separate lines. If the integrand is a combination of terms, perhaps each term is an assumption. But that might not be necessary. Alternatively, the problem is presented as is, and the assumptions are just the integral limits and the integrand's expression.\n\nSo perhaps the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{12\\arctan^2(x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right) - \\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right)}{x}\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals \\(\\frac{9\\pi^4}{16}\\).\n\nBut to adhere strictly to the example's style, where each assumption is a separate line, even if they are parts of the same object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0.\nThe upper limit of integration is 1.\nThe integrand includes the term \\(12\\arctan^2(x)\\).\nThe integrand includes the term \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right)\\).\nThe integrand includes the term \\(\\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1 - x)^2}{1 + x^2}\\right)\\).\nThe integrand is divided by x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals \\(\\frac{9\\pi^4}{16}\\).\n\nBut this seems too granular. The example had two assumptions for the problem, even though the original problem's statement had one condition (for every integer n). It seems like in the example, the assistant incorrectly split the original problem into two assumptions, possibly misinterpreting the original problem. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are just the integral limits and the integrand's expression, each as a separate line. However, the integrand's expression is a single line.\n\nIn the example, the formatted problem's assumptions were:\n\n- $n$ is an integer,\n- $n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem was to prove for every integer n, which doesn't require n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Assuming that the user wants each assumption to be a separate condition on the objects involved, in the current problem, the integral's limits and the integrand are the main components. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed over the interval [0, 1].\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{12\\arctan^2 x \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right) - \\ln^3\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right)}{x}\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int _0^1\\frac{12\\arctan ^2 x\\ln \\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right)-\\ln ^3\\left(\\frac{(1-x)^2}{1+x^2}\\right)}{x}\\:dx=\\frac{9 \\pi ^4}{16}$$\n\nBut following the example, where the problem is restated concisely. So the assumptions list the conditions, and the problem is the main statement. Given that, I think this is the correct formatting.",
