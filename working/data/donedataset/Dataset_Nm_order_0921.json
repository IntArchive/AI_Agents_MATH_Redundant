    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $n$ is odd, the numbers $u_k=\\cos k\\pi/n$ are the same as the numbers $\\cos 2k\\pi/n$, i.e. the distinct angles $\\theta$ satisfying $n\\theta=0$ (mod $2\\pi$).  We think of them as the roots of the equation $\\cos n\\theta=1$.  Writing\n$$\\cos n\\theta = \\cos^n\\theta - \\binom{n}{2}\\cos^{n-2}\\theta\\sin^2\\theta \\cdots \\pm n\\cos\\theta \\sin^{n-1}\\theta$$\nand using $\\sin^2\\theta=1-\\cos^2\\theta$, we see that the $u_k$'s are the roots of the polynomial\n$$p(u)=u^n - \\binom{n}{2}u^{n-2}(1-u^2) \\pm n u(1-u^2)^{(n-1)/2} + 1.$$\nNote that all powers of $u$ which occur are odd (except for the constant term).\nThe reciprocals $1/u_k$ are the roots of the \"reverse polynomial\"\n$$r(u)=u^n p(1/u) = u^n + a_{n-1} u^{n-1} + \\cdots,$$\nwhere $a_{n-1}=\\pm n$ and $a_{n-2}=0$. The sum in question is the sum of the squares of the roots of $r(u)$, i.e. $a_{n-1}^2 - 2a_{n-2} = n^2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving a sum involving the reciprocal of cosine squared terms equals n squared when n is odd. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that n is odd. So the main assumption here is that n is an odd integer. The problem is to prove the sum from k=0 to n-1 of 1 over cos squared (pi k /n) equals n squared. \n\nWait, are there any other assumptions? The example given in the question uses specific angles (20°, 40°, etc.), which correspond to n=9 since pi/9 radians is 20 degrees. But in the general problem, the user specifies that n is odd. So the key conditions are that n is an odd integer. The problem doesn't mention anything else, like restrictions on k or other terms, so I think that's the only assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumption is \"n is an odd integer.\" The problem is to prove the sum equals n squared. I need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line. Since there's only one assumption here, that's straightforward. \n\nWait, the example provided in the user's instruction had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the original problem says \"where n is odd,\" so maybe the assumption is \"n is an odd integer.\" That's a single condition. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: n is an odd integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(cos²(πk/n)) = n².\n\nYes, that seems right. No other hidden assumptions here. The user in their example split into two lines if there are multiple assumptions, but here only one. Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote \"where n is odd,\" so that's the only condition. Okay, that's all.",
