    "Content": "Let $f: \\Bbb C \\to \\Bbb C$ be an entire (analytic on the whole plane) function such that exists $\\omega_1,\\omega_2 \\in \\mathbb{S}^1$, linearly independent over $\\Bbb R$ such that: $$f(z+\\omega_1)=f(z)=f(z+\\omega_2), \\quad \\forall\\,z\\in \\Bbb C.$$Prove that $f$ is constant. The intuition seems clear to me, we have the three vertices of a triangle given by $0$, $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$. All points in the plane are one of the vertices of that triangle under a suitable parallel translation. The constant value will be $f(0)$, fine. Throwing values for $z$ there, I have found that $$f(n\\omega_1) = f(\\omega_1) = f(0)=f(\\omega_2) = f(n\\omega_2), \\quad \\forall\\, n \\in \\Bbb Z.$$ I don't know how to improve the above for, say, rationals (at least). Some another ideas would be: Checking that $f' \\equiv 0$. I don't have a clue of how to do that. Write $w = a\\omega_1+b\\omega_2$, with $a,b \\in \\Bbb R$, do stuff and conclude that $f(w) = f(0)$. This approach doesn't seem good, because I only have a weak result with integers above. Finding that $f$ coincides with $f(0)$ on a set with an accumulation point. This seems also bad: the set on with $f$ coincides with $f(0)$ by which I found above is discrete. Nothing works and this is getting annoying... And I don't see how analyticity comes in there. I'll be very thankful if someone can give me an idea. (On a side note.. I know that this title is not informative at all. Feel free to edit if you come up with something better.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The values the function take on the plane are the values it takes in the compact parallelogram with vertices on $0,\\omega_1,\\omega_2,\\omega_1+\\omega_2$ . Therefore the entire function is bounded, and hence constant by Liouville's theorem. Every point $z$ of the plane can be written as $z=x\\omega_1+y\\omega_2$ with $x,y$ reals, since $\\omega_1,\\omega_2$ are independent over the reals. Then $$f(z)=f(\\{x\\}\\omega_1+\\{y\\}\\omega_2),$$ where $0\\leq\\{x\\}<1$ is such that $x-\\{x\\}$ is integer. The point $\\{x\\}\\omega_1+\\{y\\}\\omega_2$ is inside the compact parallelogram with vertices $0,\\omega_1,\\omega_2,\\omega_1+\\omega_2$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nThe original question is about proving that a doubly-periodic entire function f is constant. Let me parse through the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem states that f is entire, meaning it's analytic everywhere on the complex plane. Then, there are two periods, ω1 and ω2, which are in the unit circle S¹ and are linearly independent over the real numbers. The function satisfies f(z + ω1) = f(z) and f(z + ω2) = f(z) for all z in C. The goal is to prove f is constant.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is entire (analytic on the whole complex plane).\n2. There exist ω1 and ω2 in S¹ (unit circle).\n3. ω1 and ω2 are linearly independent over R.\n4. f is periodic with periods ω1 and ω2 (so f(z + ω1) = f(z) and f(z + ω2) = f(z) for all z).\n\nEach assumption should be a single line addressing one property of one object. Let me check each point:\n\n- \"f is entire\" is one assumption about f.\n- \"There exist ω1, ω2 ∈ S¹\" – but the problem mentions they are in S¹ and linearly independent over R. Wait, S¹ is the unit circle, so ω1 and ω2 are complex numbers of modulus 1. But linear independence over R means that they are not scalar multiples of each other by real numbers. So, for example, if ω1 = 1 and ω2 = i, they are linearly independent over R because you can't write i as a real multiple of 1. So, that's another condition on ω1 and ω2.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list each property:\n\n1. f: C → C is entire.\n2. ω1 and ω2 are elements of S¹ (i.e., |ω1| = |ω2| = 1).\n3. ω1 and ω2 are linearly independent over R.\n4. f(z + ω1) = f(z) for all z ∈ C.\n5. f(z + ω2) = f(z) for all z ∈ C.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem statement is to prove that f is constant.\n\nI need to ensure that the assumptions are split correctly. The original problem says \"exists ω1, ω2 ∈ S^1, linearly independent over R such that...\" So the existence of such ω1 and ω2 is part of the problem's conditions. So the assumptions are:\n\n- f is entire.\n- There exist ω1, ω2 in S¹.\n- ω1 and ω2 are linearly independent over R.\n- f is periodic with periods ω1 and ω2.\n\nTherefore, each of these is a separate line in the assumptions. The problem is to prove f is constant.\n\nLet me check the example given. In the example, the assumption was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, each condition is separate. So similarly, each condition here should be separate.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is entire,\nω₁ and ω₂ are in 𝕊¹ (unit circle),\nω₁ and ω₂ are linearly independent over ℝ,\nf(z + ω₁) = f(z) for all z ∈ ℂ,\nf(z + ω₂) = f(z) for all z ∈ ℂ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is constant.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the periods are ω1 and ω2 which are in S^1 and linearly independent over R. So maybe the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℂ → ℂ is entire,\nThere exist ω₁, ω₂ ∈ 𝕊¹,\nω₁ and ω₂ are linearly independent over ℝ,\nf(z + ω₁) = f(z) for all z ∈ ℂ,\nf(z + ω₂) = f(z) for all z ∈ ℂ.\n\nYes, that's correct. Each of these is a separate condition. The problem is to prove f is constant.\n\nI need to make sure that in the Assumption section, each line is only addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\n1. The function f is entire. (applies to f)\n2. There exist ω₁, ω₂ in the unit circle. (applies to ω₁, ω₂)\n3. ω₁ and ω₂ are linearly independent over ℝ. (applies to ω₁, ω₂)\n4. f is periodic with period ω₁. (applies to f)\n5. f is periodic with period ω₂. (applies to f)\n\nYes, each line addresses one property of one object. Therefore, the formatted problem would be as above.\n\nNow, checking the original problem's title and content. The user mentions that the function is doubly-periodic with periods ω1 and ω2, which are linearly independent over R and lie on the unit circle. The user also states that f is entire. So all these are given conditions.\n\nThe problem is to prove f is constant. So the structured problem should have those assumptions and the problem statement.",
