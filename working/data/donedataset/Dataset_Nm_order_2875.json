    "Content": "Firstly, I will define what Pythagorean Triples are for those who do not know. Definition: A Pythagorean Triple is a group of three integers $a$ , $b$ and $c$ such that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ , since the Pythagorean Theorem asserts that for any $90^\\circ$ (right-angle) triangle $ABC$ with sides $a$ , $b$ and $c$ , one will always have the equation, $a^2+b^2=c^2$ . I was looking at Pythagorean Triples and noticed another property apart from how $a^2+b^2=c^2$ . Here are the first $30$ Pythagorean Triples $(a,b,c)$ ordered from smallest to greatest value, i.e. $$(a,b,c)\\qquad\\text{ s.t. }\\qquad a<b<c.\\tag*{$\\big(\\text{s.t. = such that}\\big)$}$$ I noticed that $a^2=(c+b)(c-b)$ , but that is trivial since $$\\begin{align}a^2&=(c+b)(c-b)\\tag{given} \\\\ &=c^2-b^2 \\\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\,\\,\\,\\, a^2+b^2&=c^2.\\end{align}$$ However, I also noticed that by having \" $u\\mid v$ \" be read as \" $u$ divides $v$ \", it appears that $$a+b+c\\mid abc.$$ For example, $(a,b,c)=(3,4,5)$ is a classic Pythagorean Triple; $3^2+4^2=5^2$ . Also, $$\\begin{align}3+4+5&=12 \\\\ \\& \\quad3\\times 4\\times 5 &= 60. \\\\ \\\\ 12 &\\,\\mid 60 \\\\ \\Leftrightarrow \\,\\,\\,\\,3+4+5&\\,\\mid 3\\times 4\\times 5.\\end{align}$$ This, I cannot prove to be true $-$ but I tested with all the $30$ Pythagorean Triples above, and I have come across no counter-example. Is there a proof? I do not know where to begin myself. Conjecture: Given three positive integers $a$ , $b$ and $c$ , if $a < b<c$ and $a^2+b^2=c^2$ , then $$a+b+c\\mid abc.$$ Thank you in advance. Edit: My conjecture was originally the other way round; i.e. if $a+b+c\\mid abc$ then $a^2+b^2=c^2$ . But $6$ is a counter-example, namely because it is a Perfect Number .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You actually want it the other way around: if $a^2+b^2=c^2$ then $a+b+c|abc$. That you can prove very quickly from the general form of primitive Pythagorean triples $(a,b,c)=(m^2-n^2,2mn,m^2+n^2)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the question according to the specified format. The original question is about whether Pythagorean triples (a, b, c) have the property that a + b + c divides abc. The user provided some context, examples, and even mentioned an edit where they corrected the conjecture's direction.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem defines a Pythagorean triple as three positive integers a, b, c with a < b < c and a² + b² = c². The conjecture is that under these conditions, a + b + c divides abc. The user initially thought the converse but corrected it. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. \n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n- a, b, c are positive integers.\n- a < b < c.\n- a² + b² = c².\n\nThe problem is to prove that a + b + c divides abc. I need to make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property. The original problem didn't mention any divisibility conditions on a, b, c except being part of a Pythagorean triple. The example given by the user, like (3,4,5), shows 3+4+5=12 dividing 3*4*5=60. They tested 30 triples without counterexamples.\n\nWait, the problem statement should be the conjecture as corrected: if (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple with a < b < c, then a + b + c divides abc. So the formatted problem would capture that.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original problem mentions \"three positive integers,\" so that's an assumption. The ordering a < b < c is another. The Pythagorean equation is the third. These are the key points. The user's edit clarifies that the direction is from Pythagorean triple to divisibility, not the reverse. So the problem is to prove that under those three conditions, the sum divides the product.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are positive integers,\na < b < c,\na² + b² = c².\n\nProblem:\nProve that a + b + c divides abc.\n\nThat should match the required format. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property for the objects a, b, c. The problem is clearly stated.",
