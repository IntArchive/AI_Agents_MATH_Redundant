    "Content": "It can be proved that there are two irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational (see Can an irrational number raised to an irrational power be rational? ) and that for each irrational number $c$ there exists another irrational number $d$ such that $c^d$ is rational (see For each irrational number b, does there exist an irrational number a such that a^b is rational? ). My question is: Is there an irrational number $a$ such that $a^a$ is rational (and how could you prove that)?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the unique (positive) solution $a$ to $x^x = 2$. If $a$ were rational, say, $a = \\frac{p}{q}$, $p$ and $q$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$, we would have $$\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^{p / q} = 2 ,$$ and rearranging gives\n$$p^p = q^p 2^q .$$\nSince there is no integer $n$ such that $n^n = 2$, we must have $q > 1$ and hence $2 \\mid p^p$. Because $2$ is prime, we have $2 \\mid p$. So, $2$ occurs an even number of times the prime factorization of $p^p$ and likewise of $q^p$. Since $p^p = q^p 2^q$, we must have $2 \\mid q$, but now $2 \\mid p, q$, and this contradicts $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$. Thus, $a$ is irrational but $a^a$ is rational (in fact, an integer).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. So the question is: Is there an irrational number \\( a \\) such that \\( a^a \\) is rational? And they want a proof or explanation for this.\n\nFirst, I remember from previous knowledge that there's a classic example involving \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Let me recall: If you take \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\), then \\( a \\) is irrational. Now, consider \\( a^a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\). Wait, but is that rational? I think the result here is actually transcendental, but maybe not. Alternatively, there's a clever trick using the law of excluded middle. Either \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is rational or it's irrational. If it's rational, then we're done because \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\) works. If it's irrational, then let’s set \\( b = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\), which would then be irrational, and then compute \\( b^{\\sqrt{2}} \\). That equals \\( (\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}})^{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}^2 = 2 \\), which is rational. So in this case, \\( a = b = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) (which is irrational in this case) would satisfy \\( a^a = 2 \\). But wait, in this second case, \\( a \\) is \\( b \\), which is irrational, and \\( a^a = 2 \\), which is rational. So either way, there exists such an \\( a \\). However, this is a non-constructive proof because we don't know whether \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is rational or not. But actually, by the Gelfond-Schneider theorem, \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is transcendental, hence irrational. So in reality, the second case is the valid one, so \\( a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational and \\( a^a = 2 \\). Therefore, the answer is yes, such an \\( a \\) exists.\n\nBut let me check the assumptions here. The problem doesn't specify any particular conditions on \\( a \\) other than being irrational and \\( a^a \\) being rational. The example I thought of uses the Gelfond-Schneider theorem which tells us that if \\( a \\) is algebraic (not 0 or 1) and \\( b \\) is irrational algebraic, then \\( a^b \\) is transcendental. Here, \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is algebraic, so \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is transcendental, hence irrational. Then, raising that to the power of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) gives 2. So in this case, the \\( a \\) would be the transcendental number \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\), which is irrational, and \\( a^a = 2 \\).\n\nAlternatively, there's a simpler example. Let me think. If we take \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\), and if \\( a^a \\) is rational, then done. If not, then take \\( a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) as before. But maybe there's a specific number that we can directly say is irrational and its self-power is rational. For instance, consider \\( a = \\ln(3) / \\ln(2) \\). Wait, \\( 2^{a} = 3 \\), so \\( a = \\log_2 3 \\), which is irrational. Then, \\( a^a = (\\log_2 3)^{\\log_2 3} \\). Is that rational? Hmm, not sure. Let me compute. Let’s set \\( x = (\\log_2 3)^{\\log_2 3} \\). Taking log base 2: \\( \\log_2 x = (\\log_2 3) \\cdot \\log_2 (\\log_2 3) \\). Unless \\( \\log_2 3 \\) is a power that makes this rational, which seems unlikely. So maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let’s take \\( a = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}\\log_2 3} \\). Then \\( a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\log_2 3} \\). Wait, \\( \\log_2 3 \\) is irrational, so if the exponent is irrational and the base is irrational (since \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is irrational), but \\( a^a \\) would be... Let me compute. \\( a = (\\sqrt{2})^{\\log_2 3} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2} \\log_2 3} = 3^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{3} \\). Wait, that makes \\( a = \\sqrt{3} \\), which is irrational. Then \\( a^a = (\\sqrt{3})^{\\sqrt{3}} \\), which is irrational. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use \\( a = \\sqrt{3} \\). Is \\( \\sqrt{3}^{\\sqrt{3}} \\) rational? Probably not. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, consider \\( a = e^{\\ln(2)/k} \\), where k is irrational. Wait, but this might not lead anywhere. Alternatively, think of \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\), as before. Since we already have the non-constructive proof, but maybe the Gelfond-Schneider gives a concrete example. Wait, Gelfond-Schneider says that if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are algebraic, \\( a \\neq 0,1 \\), and \\( b \\) irrational, then \\( a^b \\) is transcendental. So \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is transcendental, hence irrational. Then, taking \\( a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\), which is irrational, then \\( a^{\\sqrt{2}} = 2 \\). So if we set \\( c = a \\), then \\( c^{\\sqrt{2}} = 2 \\). But the problem wants \\( a^a \\), not \\( a^{\\sqrt{2}} \\). So maybe this is a different case.\n\nWait, so the original approach: Let’s consider \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\). If \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is rational, then done. If not, then take \\( a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\), which is irrational, then \\( a^a = (\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}})^{\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\sqrt{2}^{2^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\times 2^{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}} \\). Wait, no, maybe I need to simplify the exponent. Let's compute the exponent: \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\times 2^{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}} = 2^{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2}}{2}}} \\). Therefore, \\( a^a = 2^{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2}}{2}}} \\). Is that rational? Probably not, since the exponent is irrational. So maybe this approach doesn't directly work as intended.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me go back. The original non-constructive proof is: Either \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is rational, in which case \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\). If not, then take \\( a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\), which is irrational, and then \\( a^{\\sqrt{2}} = 2 \\), which is rational. But the problem asks for \\( a^a \\) to be rational, not \\( a^{\\sqrt{2}} \\). So this line of reasoning gives an example where \\( a^b \\) is rational for some \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), but not \\( a^a \\).\n\nWait a minute, the user's question is specifically about \\( a^a \\). So the previous approach where we use \\( a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) to get \\( a^{\\sqrt{2}} = 2 \\) isn't directly applicable here. That answers a different question, where \\( a^b \\) is rational. So maybe the initial approach I was thinking of isn't sufficient.\n\nSo maybe I need another strategy. Let's think differently. Suppose we take \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\). If \\( a^a \\) is rational, done. If not, then \\( a^a \\) is irrational. Then perhaps raise \\( a \\) to some power related to \\( a \\). But I need \\( a^a \\) itself to be rational. So how can we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, consider the number \\( a = \\ln(3) \\). Then \\( a^a = \\ln(3)^{\\ln(3)} \\). Is that rational? Probably not. Alternatively, take \\( a = e^{W(\\ln 3)} \\), where \\( W \\) is the Lambert W function. Then \\( a^a = e^{W(\\ln 3) \\cdot e^{W(\\ln 3)}} = e^{\\ln 3} = 3 \\), which is rational. But then \\( a = e^{W(\\ln 3)} \\). Is this number irrational? Let's see. The equation \\( a e^{a} = \\ln 3 \\). If \\( a \\) were rational, say \\( p/q \\), then \\( (p/q) e^{p/q} = \\ln 3 \\). But \\( e^{p/q} \\) is transcendental for rational \\( p/q \\neq 0 \\), so the left-hand side would be transcendental, but \\( \\ln 3 \\) is also transcendental. However, this doesn't immediately tell us if \\( a \\) is rational or not. It's more likely that \\( a \\) is irrational, but this is not straightforward to prove. So maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about known numbers. For example, \\( e \\) is irrational. What about \\( e^e \\)? That's known to be irrational? I think it's not known whether \\( e^e \\) is rational or not, but it's believed to be transcendental, hence irrational. So that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps using logarithms. Suppose we set \\( a^a = 2 \\). Then taking natural logs, \\( a \\ln a = \\ln 2 \\). Let \\( a \\) be the solution to this equation. Is \\( a \\) rational? If \\( a \\) is rational, say \\( p/q \\), then \\( (p/q) \\ln(p/q) = \\ln 2 \\). But \\( \\ln(p/q) \\) is irrational unless \\( p/q = 1 \\), which would lead to \\( 0 = \\ln 2 \\), which is false. So \\( a \\) must be irrational. Therefore, the solution to \\( a^a = 2 \\) is irrational. Hence, such an \\( a \\) exists. However, we need to prove that this equation has a solution. Since the function \\( f(a) = a^a \\) is continuous on \\( (0, \\infty) \\), and \\( f(1) = 1 \\), \\( f(2) = 4 \\). Since 2 is between 1 and 4, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists an \\( a \\) in (1,2) such that \\( a^a = 2 \\). Moreover, this solution is unique because \\( f(a) \\) is strictly increasing for \\( a > 1/e \\). Therefore, there exists a unique real number \\( a \\) in (1,2) such that \\( a^a = 2 \\). And since this \\( a \\) cannot be rational (as shown earlier), it must be irrational. Therefore, such an \\( a \\) exists.\n\nBut wait, how do we know that this \\( a \\) is irrational? Suppose \\( a \\) is rational, say \\( p/q \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are coprime integers. Then \\( (p/q)^{p/q} = 2 \\). Raising both sides to the power \\( q \\), we get \\( (p/q)^p = 2^q \\). So \\( p^p / q^p = 2^q \\), which implies \\( p^p = 2^q \\cdot q^p \\). Since \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are coprime, \\( q \\) must divide \\( p^p \\), but since they are coprime, \\( q \\) must be 1. Therefore, \\( a = p \\), an integer. Then \\( p^p = 2 \\). But the only integer solutions are \\( p = 1 \\) (1^1=1≠2) and \\( p=2 \\) (2^2=4≠2). So no integer solutions. Therefore, \\( a \\) must be irrational. Hence, the solution \\( a \\) to \\( a^a = 2 \\) is irrational. Therefore, such an \\( a \\) exists.\n\nSo this provides a constructive proof. However, the number \\( a \\) is not known explicitly but is guaranteed to exist. Therefore, the answer is yes, there exists an irrational number \\( a \\) such that \\( a^a \\) is rational. The example is the unique solution to \\( a^a = 2 \\) in the interval (1,2), which must be irrational.\n\nAlternatively, another example could be \\( a = \\sqrt{2} \\) if \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is rational. But as per Gelfond-Schneider, \\( \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is transcendental, hence irrational. So that case doesn't hold, but the previous constructive method works.\n\nSo summarizing, the answer is yes, and the proof involves considering the equation \\( a^a = 2 \\), showing that its solution exists in (1,2), and proving that this solution must be irrational.\n\nNow, structuring this according to the user's format. The original question asks if there's an irrational \\( a \\) such that \\( a^a \\) is rational, and how to prove it. The assumptions here are:\n\n- \\( a \\) is an irrational number.\n- \\( a^a \\) is a rational number.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state additional conditions; it's just asking for existence. Therefore, in the user's format, the assumptions would be minimal, perhaps none beyond the problem statement. But the example provided in the user's example had an assumption like \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" which was part of the original problem. However, in the current problem, the only assumption is that $a$ is irrational, and we need to show that $a^a$ can be rational.\n\nWait, the user's example had the original problem stating \"Prove that for every integer $n$...\" and the formatted problem added an assumption that \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in the current problem, the user's question doesn't have any additional hidden assumptions. The problem is straightforward: \"Is there an irrational number $a$ such that $a^a$ is rational?\" So, in the user's format, perhaps the assumptions would be none beyond the problem statement, but maybe the answer requires considering specific cases.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example given by the user: the original problem's assumption was that the number is divisible by 91, but the user's formatted problem included the assumption that $n$ is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the user is extracting implicit assumptions. Wait, the original example had the problem as proving A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumption is listed as \"$n$ is an integer\", which is given in the problem statement, and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", which perhaps was part of the problem's conditions but wasn't in the original problem as presented. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove it for every integer n, so perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, the example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include n being divisible by 7 unless it's part of the problem's hidden conditions. Maybe there's a mistake in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, we need to list assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question is simply asking if there's an irrational number a such that a^a is rational. There are no hidden assumptions; the problem is self-contained. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: \n$a$ is an irrational number.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $a^a$ is rational.\n\nBut the actual problem is to show existence, so the problem statement is \"Is there an irrational number $a$ such that $a^a$ is rational? (and how could you prove that)\".\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if there exists an irrational number $a$ such that $a^a$ is rational, and provide a proof.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is written as \"Prove that...\", so perhaps in this case, since the answer is affirmative, it would be \"Prove that there exists an irrational number $a$ such that $a^a$ is rational.\"\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the task is to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem sections, filtering unrelated information. The original question mentions prior results about two numbers a and b, but that's background, not part of the current problem. So the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. In this case, the problem is to find an irrational a where a^a is rational, so the only assumption is that a is irrational, and the problem is to show that a^a can be rational.\n\nBut the user's example added assumptions that weren't explicitly stated. For instance, in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake unless the original problem had that condition. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should not include \"n is divisible by 7\". This suggests that maybe the user's example has an error, or perhaps there was a miscommunication. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the formatted version corrected it. But regardless, for the current problem, since there are no additional conditions beyond a being irrational, the assumptions would just be that a is irrational, and the problem is to show a^a is rational.\n\nBut the user's example extracted assumptions from the problem statement. In the current problem, the only condition is that a is irrational. So perhaps the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $a^a$ is rational.\n\nBut the original problem is phrased as a question: \"Is there an irrational number a such that a^a is rational?\" So perhaps the problem should be structured as determining existence. However, following the user's example, which rephrased the problem as \"Prove that...\" even if the original was a question. The example's original problem was \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem also starts with \"Prove that...\". In the current case, the original problem is a question, so perhaps it should be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether $a^a$ is rational.\n\nBut the user's example transformed a \"Prove that...\" into assumptions and problem. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is the task. In this case, the problem is to determine existence, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nNone explicitly stated beyond $a$ being irrational.\n\nBut the user's example included \"$n$ is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the original problem's statement. So perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an irrational number $a$ such that $a^a$ is rational.\n\nBut the original problem is asking whether such an $a$ exists and how to prove it. So the formatted problem should be as above.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$a$ is an irrational number.\n\nProblem: \nProve that there exists an irrational number $a$ such that $a^a$ is rational.",
