    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The original question is about proving that the function F(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x is increasing when x > 0. Let me start by recalling the example provided. The user wants me to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, let's parse the original question. The function is defined as F(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x. The goal is to prove that this function is increasing for all x > 0. So, the assumptions here are about the domain of x and the function's definition. \n\nThe first assumption is that x is greater than 0. That's straightforward. The function F is defined for x > 0 because if x were negative or zero, 1/x would be problematic. So, the domain is x > 0. Next, the function itself is given as F(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x. That's another assumption. Each assumption should be a single line, each about one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nWait, in the example given, the assumptions included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, there's no mention of n being an integer. Wait, no, the current problem is about x > 0, which is a real number. So, maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n1. x is a real number such that x > 0.\n2. F(x) is defined as (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that F(x) is increasing when x > 0. However, the user might have additional implicit assumptions. Wait, in the original example, they had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. But in this problem, the user's original question doesn't specify any additional conditions beyond x > 0. So, maybe the only assumptions are x > 0 and the definition of F(x). \n\nWait, but in the example, the user had to filter out unrelated information. The original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer and also that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, and the user restructured it with assumptions. Wait, perhaps the example was a modified version. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the original problem's answer would need n to be such that 91 divides A(n). Since 91 is 7*13, maybe the problem required that n satisfies divisibility by both 7 and 13? But in the example, the formatted problem's assumptions include n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but regardless, the instruction here is to list all assumptions of the problem, each as a single line.\n\nSo, applying that to the current problem. The problem is to prove that F(x) is increasing when x > 0. The function F is defined as (1 + 1/x)^x for x > 0. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number greater than 0.\n- F(x) is defined as (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nBut wait, the original question didn't explicitly state that x is a real number, but since x is in the denominator, x must be a non-zero real number, and since x > 0, it's implied. So, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a real number.\n2. x > 0.\n3. F(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"x is a real number\" and \"x > 0\" are separate. However, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer,\" which combines the type (integer) and the condition. But maybe in this case, it's better to combine them as \"x is a real number greater than 0\" since in real analysis, the domain is often specified as x > 0 without mentioning real numbers explicitly. But to adhere strictly to the format, perhaps separate them. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" as one assumption, which is both the type and a condition. Similarly, here, perhaps \"x is a real number such that x > 0\" as one line. Alternatively, split into two: \"x is a real number\" and \"x > 0\". But in the example, the problem's original assumption was \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. The second assumption in the example was \"n is divisible by 7\", which was part of the problem's conditions. Wait, but in the original problem, it was stated as \"for every integer n\", so why was there an assumption that n is divisible by 7? That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. If the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be that n is an integer, and the conclusion is that 91 divides A(n). But in the formatted problem, the assumptions include n divisible by 7, which is not part of the original problem. That must be a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the example is erroneous, but the user provided it as an example, so we have to follow the structure as per their example, even if it includes incorrect assumptions.\n\nTherefore, in their example, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem includes an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in their structure, assumptions include all conditions, even if some are not in the original problem. Wait, but that would be wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated information and present the core assumptions. But in that case, the example seems flawed. However, the user's instruction is to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem. Therefore, in their example, perhaps the original problem had some extra information that was filtered out, leading to the assumptions listed. But without seeing the original problem's exact wording, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the question is to prove that F(x) is increasing when x > 0, where F(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a real number with x > 0.\n2. F(x) is defined as (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem as per the example:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number greater than 0,\nF(x) is defined as (1 + 1/x)^x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that F(x) is increasing when x > 0.\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"How to prove (1+1/x)^x is increasing when x>0?\" and the question restates that. So there's no extra information to filter. Hence, the assumptions are as above.",
