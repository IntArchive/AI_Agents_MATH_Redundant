    "Content": "I have to show that the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2-1)$ is not isomorphic with $\\mathbb{Z}\\times \\mathbb{Z}$ . I know that $(\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z})^*=\\{(\\pm1,\\pm1)\\}$ , so I thought I should be looking for elements which have inverses in $\\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2-1)$ and hopefully find more or less than 4.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Okay, let's start with the polynomial ring and try to define an isomorphism to the product ring. The multiplicative identity needs to go to the multiplicative identity, for starters:\n\\[1 \\mapsto (1,1)\\]\nThe only remaining question is where $X$ goes. Well, we have $X^2 = 1$, so $X$ has to go to an element that squares to the identity. If it's $(1,1)$ or $(-1,-1)$ the homomorphism won't be injective, so it's either $(1,-1)$ or $(-1,1)$, and it doesn't really matter which:\n\\[X \\mapsto (1,-1)\\]\nNow a general element of the polynomial ring can be written $a + bX$ for integers $a$ and $b$, and it'll be mapped to: \\[(a + b, a - b)\\]\nBut the difference between these two entries is $2b$, so we can never make any element of $\\mathbb Z \\times \\mathbb Z$ whose entries differ by an odd number. In particular, the proposed homomorphism does not hit $(1,0)$ and is not surjective.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about showing that the ring ℤ[X]/(X²−1) is not isomorphic to ℤ×ℤ. The user mentioned something about units in both rings, noting that (ℤ×ℤ)* has four elements: (±1, ±1). They tried looking for units in ℤ[X]/(X²−1) but didn't succeed and are asking for hints.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem is about rings not being isomorphic. The key assumptions here would be the definitions of the rings involved. \n\nSo, the first assumption is about the ring ℤ[X]/(X²−1). This is the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients modulo the ideal generated by X²−1. The elements here are equivalence classes where two polynomials are equivalent if their difference is a multiple of X²−1.\n\nThe second ring is ℤ×ℤ, which is the product ring of integers with componentwise operations. The problem states that these two rings are not isomorphic, and the user wants to show this by looking at their unit groups.\n\nThe user's approach was to compare the units in both rings. They know that (ℤ×ℤ)* has four units, so if ℤ[X]/(X²−1) has a different number of units, that would show they're not isomorphic. But the user didn't find the units, so maybe there's another approach. However, the problem is structured to focus on the units as the key point.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include the definitions of both rings. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break them down:\n\n1. The first ring is ℤ[X]/(X²−1). This is a quotient ring of the polynomial ring over ℤ by the ideal generated by X²−1.\n2. The second ring is ℤ×ℤ, the product ring of integers.\n3. The problem involves showing these two rings are not isomorphic.\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, the assumptions were more about conditions on the objects (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are more about the structures of the rings. But according to the instructions, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The ring ℤ[X]/(X²−1) is a quotient ring of the polynomial ring ℤ[X] by the ideal generated by X²−1.\n- The ring ℤ×ℤ is the product ring with componentwise addition and multiplication.\n- Isomorphism between rings requires a bijective homomorphism preserving ring structure.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't state any additional conditions; it's asking to show the non-isomorphism. So maybe the assumptions are just the definitions of the two rings. The problem is to show they aren't isomorphic. However, the user's attempt focuses on units, so perhaps another assumption is that isomorphism preserves unit groups. But maybe that's part of the reasoning, not the problem's assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are inherent in the problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in that case, the problem was modified to include that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. So the example might not be the best guide here. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Let me check.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory because the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an extra condition. That might have been an error. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to modify the problem, but that's confusing. Anyway, perhaps the example isn't the best to follow strictly.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to show ℤ[X]/(X²−1) is not isomorphic to ℤ×ℤ. The user's approach is via units, but maybe there's another method. However, the problem itself doesn't have additional conditions; it's a structural problem. So perhaps the assumptions are simply the definitions of the two rings. Each ring is an object with certain properties.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The ring R1 is defined as ℤ[X]/(X²−1).\n- The ring R2 is defined as ℤ×ℤ.\n\nProblem: Show that R1 is not isomorphic to R2.\n\nBut the user's attempt is about units, so maybe another assumption is that if two rings are isomorphic, their unit groups must also be isomorphic. However, that's a general property, not specific to the problem. Perhaps the problem's assumptions are just the definitions of the two rings, and the problem is to show they're not isomorphic. The user is trying to use units, but perhaps there are other ways, like ring properties (e.g., one is reduced, the other isn't, or one has nontrivial nilpotents, etc.)\n\nAlternatively, maybe in ℤ[X]/(X²−1), X² ≡ 1, so elements can be written as a + bX with a, b ∈ ℤ, and multiplication is done modulo X²−1. Then, perhaps finding units in this ring would involve solving (a + bX)(c + dX) ≡ 1 mod X²−1. That gives equations: ac + bd ≡ 1 (since X²=1, so cross terms bcX + adX, and then X terms must cancel. Wait, let me compute:\n\n(a + bX)(c + dX) = ac + (ad + bc)X + bd X². But X²=1, so this becomes (ac + bd) + (ad + bc)X. For this to equal 1 in the quotient ring, we need:\n\nac + bd = 1\n\nand\n\nad + bc = 0\n\nSo solving these equations for integers a,b,c,d. The units in R1 are pairs (a,b) where there exist c,d such that ac + bd =1 and ad + bc=0.\n\nThe user mentions that in ℤ×ℤ, the units are (±1, ±1), four elements. If in R1 there are more units, or fewer, then they can't be isomorphic. Let's see: perhaps R1 has more units. For example, (1 + X) might be a unit. Let's check: (1 + X)(1 - X) = 1 - X² = 1 -1 =0, but in the quotient ring, X²=1, so (1+X)(1−X)=0. So 1+X is a zero divisor, hence not a unit. Wait, but that's a problem. So maybe there are other units. Let's take a=1, b=1. Then solving ac + bd =1 and ad + bc=0. Let’s set a=1, b=1:\n\nc + d =1\n\nd + c =0\n\nFrom the second equation, c = -d. Substitute into first equation: -d + d =1 ⇒ 0=1, impossible. So (1 + X) is not a unit.\n\nWhat about a=1, b=0? Then c=1, d=0 gives 1*1 +0=1, and 1*0 +0*1=0. So (1 +0X) is a unit, as expected. Similarly, a= -1, b=0 is a unit. What about a=0, b=1? Then c must satisfy 0* c +1*d =1 ⇒ d=1. And 0*d +1*c =0 ⇒ c=0. So (0 +1X)(0 +1X) = X²=1, so X*X=1. Therefore, X is a unit with inverse X. So X is a unit. Similarly, -X is a unit. So the units include (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), but also possibly others. Wait, but let's see. Suppose a=2, b=1. Then solving 2c + d=1 and 2d +c=0. From second equation: c= -2d. Substitute into first: 2*(-2d) +d = -4d +d = -3d =1 ⇒ d= -1/3, which is not integer. So no solution. What about a=1, b=1? As before, no solution. So maybe the units are only those where either a=±1, b=0 or a=0, b=±1. But wait, when a=0, b=1, then inverse is (0,1) as X*X=1. Similarly for b=-1, X*(-X)= -X²= -1, so that's not 1. Wait, (-X)*(-X)=X²=1. So yes, X and -X are units. So in total, the units would be { (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1) }, which is four elements, same as ℤ×ℤ. Hmm, so that approach might not work. Therefore, the user's initial thought might not be sufficient because both rings have four units. Then the problem must be approached differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ring ℤ[X]/(X²−1) has more units. Wait, let me think again. Suppose we have an element a + bX where a and b are integers. The inverse is c + dX such that (a + bX)(c + dX) =1. As before:\n\nac + bd =1\n\nad + bc =0\n\nLet’s solve for c and d. From the second equation, ad = -bc ⇒ d = (-bc)/a, assuming a ≠0. Substitute into first equation: a c + b*(-bc)/a =1 ⇒ (a² c - b² c)/a =1 ⇒ c(a² - b²)/a =1. Since a and b are integers, for this to hold, a must divide c(a² - b²). Let's suppose a ≠0. For simplicity, let's consider possible small a and b.\n\nTake a=1, b=0: Then c=1, d=0. Unit.\n\na=1, b=1: Then equations:\n\nc + d =1\n\nc + d =0 → Contradiction.\n\nNo solution.\n\na=1, b=2:\n\nc + 2d =1\n\nd + 2c =0 → d= -2c\n\nSubstitute into first equation: c +2*(-2c)=1 → c -4c=1 → -3c=1 → c= -1/3. Not integer.\n\na=2, b=1:\n\n2c + d=1\n\n2d + c=0 → c= -2d\n\nSubstitute into first: 2*(-2d) +d = -4d +d = -3d=1 → d= -1/3. Not integer.\n\na=2, b=3:\n\n2c +3d=1\n\n2d +3c=0 → 2d= -3c → d= -3c/2\n\nSubstitute into first: 2c +3*(-3c/2)=1 → 2c -9c/2 = (4c -9c)/2 = -5c/2=1 → c= -2/5. Not integer.\n\na=0, b=1:\n\n0*c +1*d =1 → d=1\n\n0*d +1*c =0 → c=0\n\nSo inverse is 0 +1*X, which checks out since X*X=1.\n\nSimilarly, a=0, b=-1: inverse is 0 + (-1)X, since (-X)*(-X)=1.\n\nNow, consider a=1, b=-1:\n\nc - d =1\n\n-c + d =0 → -c +d=0 → d=c\n\nSubstitute into first equation: c -c =1 → 0=1. Contradiction.\n\nWhat about a=3, b=2:\n\n3c +2d=1\n\n3d +2c=0 → 3d= -2c → d= -2c/3\n\nSubstitute into first: 3c +2*(-2c/3)=1 → 3c -4c/3 = (9c -4c)/3=5c/3=1 → c=3/5. Not integer.\n\nSo far, only the obvious units: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1). So four units. Same as ℤ×ℤ. Therefore, the unit groups are isomorphic, both of order 4. So that approach doesn't work. Hence, the user's initial thought might not be the right path. Therefore, another method is needed.\n\nAnother approach: Look for other ring-theoretic properties. For example, ℤ×ℤ has two idempotent elements (1,0) and (0,1), which are non-trivial (i.e., other than 0 and 1). In ℤ[X]/(X²−1), let's see if there are non-trivial idempotents. An element e is idempotent if e²=e. So suppose a + bX is idempotent. Then:\n\n(a + bX)² = a² + 2abX + b²X² = a² + 2abX + b²*1 = (a² + b²) + 2abX ≡ a + bX mod (X²−1).\n\nTherefore, equating coefficients:\n\na² + b² = a\n\n2ab = b\n\nFrom the second equation: 2ab = b ⇒ b(2a -1)=0. So either b=0 or 2a=1. Since a and b are integers, 2a=1 implies a=1/2, which is not integer. Therefore, b must be 0. Then from first equation: a² = a ⇒ a=0 or a=1. Thus, the only idempotents are 0 and 1. Therefore, unlike ℤ×ℤ, which has (1,0) and (0,1) as additional idempotents, the ring ℤ[X]/(X²−1) has only trivial idempotents. Hence, they cannot be isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved by considering idempotent elements. So the key difference is the number of idempotents.\n\nThus, the assumptions are the definitions of the two rings, and the problem is to show they are not isomorphic. The formatted problem should list assumptions about the rings and the problem statement.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Here, the objects are the two rings. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The ring ℤ[X]/(X²−1) is the polynomial ring over ℤ modulo the ideal generated by X²−1.\n- The ring ℤ×ℤ is the product ring of integers with componentwise operations.\nProblem: Show that ℤ[X]/(X²−1) is not isomorphic to ℤ×ℤ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions include that the user is working in the category of rings, and isomorphism means ring isomorphism. But that's generally assumed.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- R1 = ℤ[X]/(X²−1) is the quotient ring of ℤ[X] by the ideal generated by X²−1.\n- R2 = ℤ×ℤ is the product ring with componentwise addition and multiplication.\nProblem: Prove that R1 is not isomorphic to R2.\n\nThat seems to fit the required format, listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or object.",
