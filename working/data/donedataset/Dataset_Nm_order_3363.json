    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that z=0 is the only real solution to the equation sin z = -z. Hmm, first I need to understand what the equation is saying. So, we're looking for real numbers z where the sine of z equals negative z. \n\nLet me start by considering the function f(z) = sin z + z. If we can show that f(z) = 0 only when z=0, that would solve the problem. Because sin z = -z is equivalent to f(z) = sin z + z = 0. \n\nSo, the next step is to analyze the function f(z). Let's check the value at z=0: sin(0) + 0 = 0, so z=0 is indeed a solution. Now, are there other solutions? \n\nLet's consider when z is positive. For z > 0, sin z can be at most 1 and at least -1. However, as z increases, the term z becomes dominant because it grows linearly, while sin z oscillates between -1 and 1. So, for z > 1, sin z + z would be greater than -1 + z. If z > 1, then -1 + z > 0 when z > 1. So for z > 1, f(z) = sin z + z > 0. That suggests there are no solutions for z > 1. \n\nWhat about between 0 and 1? Let's check the behavior of f(z) in that interval. The derivative of f(z) is f’(z) = cos z + 1. Since cos z is always between -1 and 1, the derivative f’(z) ranges from 0 to 2. Specifically, for z in (0, π/2), cos z is positive, so f’(z) = cos z + 1 is always greater than 0. That means f(z) is strictly increasing on (0, π/2). Since f(0)=0 and the function is increasing, there's no other zero crossing in (0, π/2). \n\nBut wait, π is approximately 3.14, so π/2 is about 1.57. But earlier I considered z > 1. So between 1 and π/2, which is up to around 1.57, let's see. For z in [1, π/2], f(z) = sin z + z. Since sin z is positive here (as z is in the first quadrant), and z is positive, f(z) is definitely positive. So again, no solution here. \n\nNow, for z negative. Let z = -t where t > 0. Then the equation becomes sin(-t) = -(-t) => -sin t = t. That implies sin t = -t. But sin t is between -1 and 1, and t is positive. So sin t = -t would require that -t is between -1 and 1. Hence, t must be between 0 and 1. But for t in (0,1), sin t is positive (since t is in radians and between 0 and π, so sin t is positive). Therefore, sin t = -t would mean a positive number equals a negative number, which is impossible. So, there are no solutions for z < 0. \n\nWait, but when z is negative, let's plug in z = -a where a > 0. Then sin z = sin(-a) = -sin a. The equation becomes -sin a = a. Which is equivalent to sin a = -a. But since a > 0, the right side is negative. However, sin a is between -1 and 1. So sin a = -a implies that -a must be between -1 and 1, so a must be between 0 and 1. But for a in (0,1), sin a is positive (because a is in (0, π/2)), so sin a is positive, but -a is negative. Hence, there's no solution here either. \n\nPutting it all together, the only real solution is z=0. \n\nTo make this rigorous, perhaps use calculus. Let f(z) = sin z + z. Then f’(z) = cos z + 1. The derivative f’(z) is always non-negative because cos z ≥ -1, so cos z +1 ≥ 0. Hence, the function f(z) is non-decreasing over the entire real line. Since f(0)=0, and for z >0, f(z) >0 (as shown earlier), and for z <0, f(z) <0? Wait, let's check. For z <0, say z approaches 0 from the left, f(z) = sin z + z. Since sin z ≈ z - z^3/6 for small z, so sin z + z ≈ 2z - z^3/6. If z is approaching 0 from the negative side, this is approximately 2z, which is negative. But as z becomes more negative, say z = -π/2, f(z) = sin(-π/2) + (-π/2) = -1 - π/2 ≈ -2.57, which is negative. However, as z goes to negative infinity, sin z oscillates between -1 and 1, and z is going to negative infinity. So f(z) = sin z + z would approach negative infinity. Wait, but since the function is non-decreasing, if it's increasing at some points, but overall non-decreasing. Wait, if the derivative is non-negative everywhere, then the function is non-decreasing everywhere. So if f(z) is non-decreasing, and f(0)=0, then for z >0, f(z) ≥0, and for z <0, f(z) ≤0. But we need to check if there's any other point where f(z)=0. \n\nBut since the function is strictly increasing at points where the derivative is positive. The derivative f’(z)=cos z +1. When is f’(z) >0? When cos z +1 >0, which is when cos z > -1. Which occurs everywhere except when z is an odd multiple of π, i.e., z = π, 3π, etc. But wait, cos z = -1 at z = π + 2πk, so at those points, the derivative is zero. So the function f(z) has derivative zero only at those discrete points. Between those points, the derivative is positive. Therefore, except at those points, the function is increasing. So overall, the function is non-decreasing. \n\nTherefore, since the function is non-decreasing and crosses zero at z=0, and is increasing except at isolated points, there can't be any other points where f(z)=0. Because if the function is non-decreasing, once it passes zero, it can't come back. So if for z>0, it's increasing, then no other zeros. Similarly, for z<0, it's non-decreasing, but since f(z) is negative there and then increases to zero at z=0, there can't be any other zeros. \n\nThus, z=0 is the only real solution. \n\nAlternatively, suppose there is another solution z ≠0. If z>0, then since f(z) is increasing, f(z) > f(0)=0, contradiction. Similarly, if z<0, then f(z) < f(0)=0, which also contradicts f(z)=0. Therefore, z=0 is the only solution. \n\nSo the assumptions here would be that z is a real number, and the problem is to prove that z=0 is the only real solution to sin z = -z.",
