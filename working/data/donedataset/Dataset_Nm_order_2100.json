    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants to prove a specific integral formula involving a logarithm and a product of terms with sine functions. The integral is from 0 to infinity of log(1 + x^{4n}) divided by (1 + x²) dx, and it's supposed to equal π times the logarithm of a product involving sine terms. The user mentioned checking it for a few n and it works, so now they need a proof.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this problem according to the given format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object. So, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe integral is ∫₀^∞ [log(1 + x^{4n}) / (1 + x²)] dx. The formula given on the right side is π log {2ⁿ product from k=1, k odd to 2n-1 of (1 + sin(πk/(4n)))}. The problem states that n=1,2,3,⋯.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be that n is a positive integer (1,2,3,...), the integral is over the positive real line, and the integrand is log(1 + x^{4n}) divided by 1 + x². Also, the result involves a product over odd k from 1 to 2n-1. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property.\n\nWait, the problem mentions n=1,2,3,⋯, so the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. The integral is definite from 0 to infinity, so that's part of the problem statement. The integrand is given, and the expression to prove is the equality with the product. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...)\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞\n- The integrand is log(1 + x^{4n})/(1 + x²)\n- The product in the result is taken over odd integers k from 1 to 2n−1\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nthe integral is computed over the interval [0, ∞),\nthe integrand is (log(1 + x^{4n}))/(1 + x²),\nthe product in the result involves k from 1 to 2n−1 where k is odd.\n\nBut the example's assumption was more about the conditions on the variables. In the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key conditions are that n is a positive integer. The rest are part of the problem statement but maybe don't need to be listed as assumptions since they are part of the integral's definition.\n\nWait, the example had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the main assumption is n is a positive integer (since the problem states n=1,2,3,...). The other parts are part of the problem setup. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption lists n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n must be divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like an error. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Maybe the example had a mistake? Because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps I need to check that again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts the original problem. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error in their example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n must be divisible by 7, that's introducing a new condition. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But since the user provided that example as a guideline, I need to follow their structure even if it's incorrect.\n\nSo, in the example, they took the original problem which didn't restrict n beyond being an integer, but in the formatted problem, they added that n must be divisible by 7. So maybe the user's approach is to list all conditions, even if they are part of the problem's given. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,…)\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity\n- The integrand is log(1 + x^{4n}) divided by (1 + x²)\n- The product in the result is over odd k from 1 to 2n−1\n\nBut according to the example, perhaps only the conditions on the variables (like n being an integer, or divisible by 7) are listed as assumptions, and the rest is part of the problem. Wait, the example's original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So they added a condition. But in reality, the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. Maybe that example is flawed. But regardless, the user wants us to follow their format.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,…)\n- The product in the result is taken over odd integers k from 1 to 2n−1\n\nBut the integral being from 0 to infinity and the integrand being log(1+x^{4n})/(1+x²) are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. The example's assumption included properties of the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7). So perhaps here, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. The other parts are part of the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"if n=1,2,3,…\", so the key assumption is n is a positive integer. The rest is the problem setup. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\log \\left(1+x^{4n} \\right)}{1+x^2}dx = \\pi \\log \\left\\{2^n \\prod_{\\substack{k=1 \\\\ k \\text{ odd}}}^{2n-1} \\left(1+\\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi k}{4n}\\right) \\right)\\right\\}$$\n\nBut the product is from k=1 to 2n−1 with k odd. So the problem is to show the integral equals that expression. The key assumption is n is a positive integer. The other details (integral bounds, integrand, product terms) are part of the problem statement. The example included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions, even if they were given in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n must be divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made an error, but regardless, following their structure, we need to parse the problem and list assumptions. So in this case, the problem is for n being positive integers. So the assumption is n is a positive integer. The rest is part of the problem.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\log \\left(1+x^{4n} \\right)}{1+x^2}dx = \\pi \\log \\left\\{2^n \\prod_{\\substack{k=1 \\\\ k \\text{ odd}}}^{2n-1} \\left(1+\\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi k}{4n}\\right) \\right)\\right\\}$$\n\nI think that's correct. The key assumption is n being a positive integer. The rest is the integral expression and the desired result.",
