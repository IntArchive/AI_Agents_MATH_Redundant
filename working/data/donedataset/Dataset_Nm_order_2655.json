    "Content": "A continuous surjection $f:X\\to Y$ is a quotient map if the topology on $Y$ is the final topology with respect to $f$ , namely, for each subset $F\\subset Y$ , $F$ is closed if $f^{-1}(F)$ is closed in $X$ . Equivalently, for each saturated closed subset $B$ of $X$ , $f(B)$ is closed in $Y$ .  (Here, saturated = saturated with respect to $f$ , i.e., saturated with respect to the fibers $f^{-1}(y)$ .) All the examples of a map that is not quotient that I could find in various references or on this site were always a little complicated.  So I tried to find a simple example of a continuous map from the reals to the reals that is not a quotient map.  After a while I realized it is not possible: Every continuous map $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is a quotient map, when viewed a surjection onto its image. Apart from checking that my reasoning below is correct, can you provide a different proof?  Specifically, is this a consequence of some more general topological results? Proof of result: Let $X=Y=\\mathbb{R}$ and $f$ be a continuous map from $X$ to $Y$ .\nLet $B$ be a saturated closed set in $X$ .  We have to show that $f(B)$ is closed in $f(X)$ .  Suppose that is not the case.  So we can find $a\\in X$ with $f(a)\\notin f(B)$ , but such that $f(a)$ is a limit point of $f(B)$ .  There is a sequence $(x_n)$ in $B$ such that $f(x_n)$ converges to $f(a)$ .  Taking a subsequence if necessary, we can assume that $f(x_n)$ converges monotonically to $f(a)$ .  Without loss of generality, say it's an increasing sequence, and $a<x_1$ . We have $f(x_1)<f(x_n)<f(a)$ , so by the intermediate value theorem there is a $z_n\\in[a,x_1]$ such that $f(z_n)=f(x_n)$ .  Since $B$ is saturated, the point $z_n$ also belongs to $B$ .  Thus $(z_n)$ is a bounded sequence in $B$ and by compactness there is a subsequence converging to a point $z\\in B$ (because $B$ is closed).  Replacing $(z_n)$ again by that subsequence, we can assume $z_n$ converges to $z$ , and by continuity of $f$ we have $f(z_n)$ converging to $f(z)$ .  But that is the same as $f(x_n)$ , which converges to $f(a)$ .  So $f(a)=f(z)$ did belong to $f(B)$ after all.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an argument that uses the same idea of your proof but doesn't involve sequences. If $X$ is path connected and $Y$ is a totally ordered set with order topology , then every continuous map $f:X\\to Y$ , viewed as a surjection onto its image, is a quotient map. Proof: First note that $f(Y)$ is connected thus must convex, thus the order topology and subspace topology coincide , so it suffices to consider a surjective $f:X\\to Y$ . If $B$ is saturated closed, we show that $f(B)$ is also closed. For every $[y,y']\\subset Y$ , choose $x,x'$ with $f(x)=y,f(x')=y'$ , and let $P$ be a path connecting $x,x'$ , then $[y,y']\\subset f(P)$ by intermediate value theorem(or just by connectness). Note that $B$ is saturated, so $f(P)\\cap f(B)=f(P\\cap B)$ is compact, and $[y,y']\\cap f(B)$ is also compact hence closed. Since every space is coherent with any family of subsets whose interiors cover it Thus all intersections $]y,y'[\\cap f(B)$ (or $[a,y'[\\cap f(B),]y,b]\\cap f(B)$ where $a,b$ are minimal or maximal in $Y$ if they exist) are also closed in $]y,y'[$ (or $[a,y'[, ]y,b]$ respectively). Since these intervals form a basis of $Y$ , we are done. Rmk1: This cannot be generalised to connected $X$ : $\\mathbb R_K$ is connected , but $\\mathrm{id}:\\mathbb R_K\\to\\mathbb R$ is continuous but not a quotient map. Rmk2: As a consequence, all topology on an ordered set that strictly finer than the order topology is not path connected.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe original question is titled \"Every continuous function from ℝ to ℝ is a quotient map\". The user is asking whether every continuous map from the reals to the reals is a quotient map when considered as a surjection onto its image. They also provide their own proof and ask for verification or alternative proofs.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions should list all conditions given in the problem, each as a separate line. The problem statement should be the main question to be addressed.\n\nLooking at the problem, the user is considering continuous functions f: ℝ → ℝ, which are surjective onto their image. The key points here are:\n\n1. f is a continuous function from ℝ to ℝ.\n2. f is viewed as a surjection onto its image, which means Y here would be f(ℝ), the image of f.\n3. The question is whether such f is necessarily a quotient map under these conditions.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove or disprove that every continuous surjective map f: ℝ → ℝ (when restricted to its image) is a quotient map. Alternatively, the user is asserting that it's true and provides a proof, so the problem could be phrased as proving that statement.\n\nNow, checking the example given by the user: In their example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user didn't have those assumptions. Wait, the example's original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original didn't mention that. Wait, no, the example seems to have a mistake. Let me check again. Wait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect, but I should follow the user's instruction regardless. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake, but according to the user's example, they filtered the original problem which said \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem includes an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user made an error in their example, but perhaps I should proceed as per their instruction.\n\nWait, perhaps the original example problem actually had a typo. Let me check again: the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, n is any integer, so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is not part of the original problem. That seems like an error in the example. Maybe the user intended to include additional assumptions but perhaps made a mistake. However, the instruction says to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem. So perhaps the task is to extract the key assumptions from the problem, even if the original problem's phrasing might not explicitly state them. But in the example given, the user added an assumption (divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, 91 is 7*13. So maybe the problem in the example requires that n is divisible by both 7 and 13? Wait, but perhaps the original problem in the example actually had a missing condition. Alternatively, maybe the user structured it wrong. Hmm, perhaps this is a mistake, but the user's example is formatted that way. So, maybe the task here is to extract the problem's assumptions as they are implicitly required. However, in the current problem, the user is talking about continuous functions from ℝ to ℝ, and the question is whether they are quotient maps when viewed as surjections onto their image. So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous.\n2. f is surjective onto its image (i.e., considered as a map from ℝ to f(ℝ)).\n\nThe problem is to prove that every such f is a quotient map.\n\nWait, but the user's original question says \"Every continuous function from ℝ to ℝ is a quotient map\". Then they clarify that they're considering f as a surjection onto its image, which is necessary because a quotient map must be surjective. So the key assumptions are:\n\n- f is continuous.\n- f is a surjection onto its image (Y = f(ℝ)).\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asserting that every continuous map f: ℝ → ℝ, when viewed as a surjection onto its image, is a quotient map. So the problem is to prove this statement.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous.\n- f is considered as a surjection onto its image f(ℝ).\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is a quotient map.\n\nWait, but the problem might not need to list \"f is considered as a surjection onto its image\" as an assumption, because the problem statement already says \"when viewed as a surjection onto its image\". But in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" which was part of the problem's conclusion. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but in this case, the user's own problem is structured as:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". Perhaps the example was a mistake, but I need to follow the user's instructions regardless.\n\nWait, maybe the task here is to filter out any unnecessary information and list only the necessary assumptions. For instance, in the original example, perhaps the problem requires that n is an integer (as given), and to have A(n) divisible by 91, which factors into 7*13. However, the user's formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be an error. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to structure the problem with necessary assumptions, but perhaps misformatted the example.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should proceed with the current problem by extracting all necessary assumptions. For the problem at hand:\n\nThe user is considering a continuous function f: ℝ → ℝ, which is surjective onto its image (since quotient maps must be surjective). The problem is to prove that every such continuous function, when viewed as a surjection onto its image, is a quotient map.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f: ℝ → ℝ is a continuous function.\n2. f is surjective onto its image (i.e., f: ℝ → f(ℝ) is surjective).\n\nBut wait, the surjectivity onto the image is inherent in the definition of the function when restricted to its image. Any function f: X → Y, when restricted to f(X), is automatically surjective. So perhaps the second assumption is redundant. However, the problem statement mentions \"when viewed a surjection onto its image\", so maybe it's necessary to include that as an assumption.\n\nBut in reality, if you take any function f: X → Y and consider it as a map from X to f(X), it is automatically surjective. So maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous.\n- The topology on f(ℝ) (the image) has the final topology with respect to f, which is part of the definition of a quotient map.\n\nWait, but the definition of a quotient map is that it is surjective and the topology on the codomain is the final topology induced by the map. So in this problem, the user is considering f: ℝ → f(ℝ) with the subspace topology from ℝ, or with the final topology? Wait, the problem says \"when viewed as a surjection onto its image\". The image f(ℝ) could have the subspace topology from ℝ, but the quotient topology induced by f would be different. Wait, but the user's original question says \"Every continuous function from ℝ to ℝ is a quotient map\", but quotient maps are defined with respect to the topology on the codomain being the quotient topology. However, in this case, the user is considering f as a map from ℝ to f(ℝ) where f(ℝ) has the subspace topology. Wait, no: The user says \"when viewed a surjection onto its image\". Then, they reference the definition of a quotient map where the topology on Y is the final topology with respect to f. Wait, but if Y is f(ℝ), then the final topology would make f a quotient map by definition. But that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no: A quotient map is a surjective map f: X → Y where Y has the topology such that a set is open in Y iff its preimage is open in X. So if Y is given the final topology, then f is a quotient map. But the user is considering f: ℝ → f(ℝ) where f(ℝ) has the subspace topology inherited from ℝ. The question is whether, under these conditions, f is a quotient map. Wait, but the subspace topology on f(ℝ) may not coincide with the quotient topology. So the problem is to show that for any continuous surjective map f: ℝ → f(ℝ) (with f(ℝ) having the subspace topology), f is a quotient map.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that when you have a continuous surjective map f: ℝ → Y, where Y = f(ℝ) with the final topology induced by f, then f is a quotient map by definition. But the user is probably asking whether, if you take Y to be f(ℝ) with the subspace topology from ℝ, is f automatically a quotient map? That would be a different question. Wait, the original question's first paragraph explains that a quotient map is one where the topology on Y is the final topology. Then the user is asking whether every continuous map from ℝ to ℝ, when viewed as a surjection onto its image (so Y is the image with the subspace topology), is a quotient map. The user's proof seems to assume that Y has the subspace topology, and tries to show that under that topology, f is quotient, i.e., that the subspace topology coincides with the quotient topology.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to parse the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Every continuous function from ℝ to ℝ is a quotient map\". The user starts by defining a quotient map as a continuous surjection where the topology on Y is the final topology (i.e., a set F in Y is closed iff its preimage is closed in X). They mention that they tried to find a continuous map from ℝ to ℝ that is not a quotient map but couldn't, leading them to conjecture that every continuous map from ℝ to ℝ is a quotient map when viewed as a surjection onto its image. They provide a proof and ask for verification or alternative proofs.\n\nSo the key point here is: Given f: ℝ → ℝ continuous, and considering it as a map from ℝ to f(ℝ) (its image) with the subspace topology on f(ℝ), is f necessarily a quotient map? A quotient map in this context would require that the subspace topology on f(ℝ) coincides with the quotient topology induced by f. Because, by definition, the quotient topology is the finest topology on Y for which f is continuous, and if the subspace topology is the same as the quotient topology, then f is a quotient map.\n\nSo the problem is: If f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous and surjective onto its image Y = f(ℝ) (with Y having the subspace topology), then is f a quotient map? The user's proof attempts to show that yes, this is always true.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous.\n- Y is the image of f, i.e., Y = f(ℝ).\n- Y is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from ℝ.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f: ℝ → Y is a quotient map.\n\nBut according to the problem statement as given by the user, they write: \"Every continuous map f:ℝ→ℝ is a quotient map, when viewed a surjection onto its image.\" So the problem is to prove that statement. Hence, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous.\n2. f is considered as a surjective map onto its image Y = f(ℝ).\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is a quotient map (where Y has the subspace topology).\n\nAlternatively, since the quotient map requires that Y's topology is the final topology, but the user is giving Y the subspace topology, so the problem is to show that these two topologies coincide, making f a quotient map.\n\nTherefore, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a continuous function from ℝ to ℝ.\n- Y is the image of f.\n- Y is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from ℝ.\n\nBut the user's example only lists two assumptions, each on one object. So maybe each assumption should be a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℝ → ℝ is continuous,\nY is the image of f (i.e., Y = f(ℝ)),\nY has the subspace topology inherited from ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f: ℝ → Y is a quotient map.\n\nBut according to the original problem statement, the user says \"when viewed a surjection onto its image\", which implies that Y is the image with its own topology. The key is that the problem is to show that the subspace topology on Y coincides with the quotient topology induced by f, hence making f a quotient map.\n\nAlternatively, since a quotient map is a surjective continuous map where the codomain has the quotient topology, but here Y has the subspace topology. The problem is to show that for continuous f: ℝ → ℝ, the subspace topology on Y = f(ℝ) coincides with the quotient topology, hence f is a quotient map.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous.\n2. Y = f(ℝ) is the image of f.\n3. Y has the subspace topology from ℝ.\n\nProblem: Prove that f: ℝ → Y is a quotient map.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a continuous function from ℝ to ℝ,\nY is the image of f,\nY is endowed with the subspace topology from ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f: ℝ → Y is a quotient map.\n\nBut the user's example included two assumptions for the same object (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). In this case, the three assumptions are about different objects (f, Y). However, the third assumption is about Y's topology.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be phrased with fewer assumptions, combining them if they relate to the same object. For example, Y is the image of f and has the subspace topology. But the user's example separated \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines, so perhaps each condition should be a separate line.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a continuous function from ℝ to ℝ,\nY is the image of f under f,\nY is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is a quotient map from ℝ to Y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are just that f is continuous and surjective onto its image (since quotient maps must be surjective). But in reality, any function to its image is surjective, so that's inherent. However, the topology on Y is crucial. Since the problem is about whether the subspace topology coincides with the quotient topology, the assumption about Y's topology is necessary.\n\nIn summary, after considering all these points, the correct formatting should include the continuity of f, Y being the image, and Y having the subspace topology. The problem is to show that under these conditions, f is a quotient map.",
