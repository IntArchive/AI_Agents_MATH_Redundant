    "Content": "In solving $\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\dfrac{\\ln(\\sin x)\\ln(\\cos x)}{\\sin x\\cos x}\\ dx,$ I have found that this is equal to $\\dfrac{1}{16}\\displaystyle\\int_0^1\\dfrac{\\ln^2(1-x)}{x}\\ dx.$ WolframAlpha says that the desired value is $\\dfrac{\\zeta(3)}{8},$ so I suspect a conversion to a series is necessary.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse through this problem. The user is asking about proving that the integral from 0 to 1 of (ln²(1 - x))/x dx equals the sum from n=1 to infinity of 2/n³. They also mention that this integral can be rewritten as the integral from 0 to 1 of ln²x/(1 - x) dx, which they relate to a series involving xⁿ ln²x. The goal is to structure this according to the given format.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem is about an integral, so the assumptions would include the limits of integration, the integrand function, and any conditions mentioned. Let's see:\n\n1. The integral is from 0 to 1. So the variable x is in the interval [0,1].\n2. The integrand is (ln²(1 - x))/x. That's the function being integrated.\n3. The problem states an alternative form: integral of ln²x/(1 - x) dx from 0 to 1. So that's another assumption about the equivalence of the two integrals.\n4. The user mentions that the integral is equal to a sum involving 2/n³. So perhaps the convergence of the series or the relation to ζ(3) is part of the problem's context, but I need to check if these are assumptions or part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original question is asking to prove the equality between the integral and the series. The assumptions should be the given conditions and any properties used. However, in the example provided, assumptions were things like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the integral is definite from 0 to 1, so the variable x is integrated over that interval. The integrand functions are defined there except perhaps at the endpoints, but since the integral is proper (I think), maybe the integrability is an assumption.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the problem is about an integral, so the assumptions might be the domain of integration and the function's properties. However, the user's instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is (ln²(1 - x))/x.\n- The integral can be rewritten as ∫₀¹ (ln²x)/(1 - x) dx.\n- The integral is equal to a series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 2/n³.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove the integral equals the series, so maybe the first three are assumptions and the last is part of the problem statement. Wait, the example had assumptions that included the conditions given in the problem. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions:\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; that seems to be an error. Wait, maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. Wait, no, looking at the example again, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the original problem had an extra condition. Hmm. The user might have intended to show that the example includes assumptions that were perhaps not all explicit. Maybe the example is illustrative but not accurate. Anyway, perhaps I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to prove that ∫₀¹ (ln²(1 - x))/x dx = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 2/n³. The problem statement also mentions that the integral can be written as ∫₀¹ (ln²x)/(1 - x) dx. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is over x from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is (ln²(1 - x))/x.\n- The integrand can be expressed as (ln²x)/(1 - x) over the same interval.\n\nThe problem is to prove that this integral equals the series sum.\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions included conditions on variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about an integral, so maybe the substitution from ln²(1 - x)/x to ln²x/(1 - x) is part of the given conditions, hence an assumption. Alternatively, maybe it's a step that the user has already taken, but since the problem includes that equivalence, perhaps it's considered part of the problem's setup.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The integration variable x is in the interval [0, 1].\n2. The integrand function is (ln²(1 - x))/x.\n3. The integral can be transformed into ∫₀¹ (ln²x)/(1 - x) dx.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that this integral equals the sum from n=1 to ∞ of 2/n³.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substitution is part of the problem's steps, not an assumption. The problem as posed in the original question says: \"How do I prove that ∫₀¹ [ln²(1 - x)]/x dx = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 2/n³?\" The user also mentions that the integral can be given as ∫₀¹ (ln²x)/(1 - x) dx. So the problem is to connect either form of the integral to the series.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The integral ∫₀¹ (ln²(1 - x))/x dx is considered.\n- The integral is equivalent to ∫₀¹ (ln²x)/(1 - x) dx.\n\nBut maybe the equivalence is a given fact here. Alternatively, perhaps each integral form is a separate assumption, but I'm not sure. The example had two assumptions about n: being integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is (ln²(1 - x))/x.\n- The integral is equivalent to ∫₀¹ (ln²x)/(1 - x) dx.\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals ∑_{n=1}^∞ 2/n³.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equivalence between the two integral forms is part of the problem's steps, not an assumption. The user mentions they know the integral can also be given as ∫₀¹ ln²x/(1 - x) dx, which they relate to a series. So maybe the problem is to start from either integral form and show it equals the series.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the assumptions should list all the conditions given. So if the problem states that the integral can be transformed into another form, that's an assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral ∫₀¹ [ln²(1 - x)]/x dx is considered.\n- The integral can be rewritten as ∫₀¹ [ln²x]/(1 - x) dx.\n- The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 2/n³ is related to the integral.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that the integral equals the series. So maybe the first two assumptions are about the integral's forms, and the problem is to equate it to the series. Let me structure it as follows:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is ∫₀¹ (ln²(1 - x))/x dx.\n- The integral can be expressed as ∫₀¹ (ln²x)/(1 - x) dx.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫₀¹ (ln²(1 - x))/x dx = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 2/n³.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral's equivalence to ∫₀¹ (ln²x)/(1 - x) dx is part of the problem's context but not an assumption. The problem could be presented as starting from either integral. The user's question is about proving the equality between the integral and the series, so perhaps the main assumption is the integral's form. The rest might be part of the problem's steps.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had assumptions that included conditions on n. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are the integral's bounds and integrand. However, the problem also mentions the equivalence between the two integral forms. Since the user says \"the above integral can also be given as...\", this is an assumption provided in the problem. Therefore, it's an existing condition or given fact. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is ∫₀¹ (ln²(1 - x))/x dx.\n- The integral can be rewritten as ∫₀¹ (ln²x)/(1 - x) dx.\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals ∑_{n=1}^∞ 2/n³.\n\nBut I need to check if each assumption is one property per line. The two integrals are two different expressions, so each would be a separate assumption. Alternatively, maybe the substitution x → 1 - x is used to show the equivalence, which is a step in the solution, but as per the problem's given information, the user states that the integral can be given as the other form, so that's part of the problem's setup. Therefore, these are two separate assumptions.\n\nSo final formatting:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe integral is over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is $\\dfrac{\\ln^2(1 - x)}{x}$,\nThe integral can be expressed as $\\displaystyle\\int_0^1 \\dfrac{\\ln^2 x}{1 - x}\\ dx$.\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\displaystyle\\int_0^1 \\dfrac{\\ln^2(1 - x)}{x}\\ dx = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\dfrac{2}{n^3}.$$\n###",
