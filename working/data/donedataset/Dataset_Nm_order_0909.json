    "Content": "I saw reference to this result of Chebyshev's:\n$$\\sum_{p\\leq n} \\frac{\\log p}{p} \\sim \\log n \\text{ as }n \\to \\infty,$$\nand its relation to the Prime Number Theorem. I'm looking into an information-theory proof by Kontoyiannis I was wondering if anyone could give me a sense for how difficult or involved the usual proof is. I don't really need to see the whole thing in detail, more wondering about the general difficulty/complexity of the result. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The result is fairly elementary.  Lets prove it now: Recall some common definitions: Let $\\theta(x)=\\sum_{p\\leq x} \\log p$ , let $\\Lambda(n)$ be the Von Mangoldt lambda function and let $\\psi(x)=\\sum_{n\\leq x} \\Lambda(n)$ Then as $\\log n =\\sum_{d|n} \\Lambda(d)$ we see that $$\\sum_{n\\leq x} \\log n=\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\sum_{d|n} \\Lambda(d)=\\sum_{d\\leq x} \\Lambda(d)\\lfloor x/d\\rfloor =x\\sum_{d\\leq x} \\frac{\\Lambda(d)}{d}+O\\left(\\psi(x) \\right)$$ Lemma $1 :$ $\\theta(x)\\leq 3x$ The proof of this is postponed until the end. Now, since $\\theta(x)=\\psi (x)+O(\\sqrt{x})$ , we have $\\psi(x)=O(x)$ .  Combining this with the fact that $\\sum_{n\\leq x} \\log n= x\\log x + O(x)$ we see that $$\\sum_{d\\leq x} \\frac{\\Lambda(d)}{d}=\\log x+O(1).$$ Since the sum over all the prime powers of $\\frac{\\Lambda(d)}{d}$ is bounded by a constant, we conclude $$\\sum_{p\\leq x}\\frac{\\log p}{p}=\\log x+O(1).$$ Hope that helps, Proof of Lemma $1 :$ Consider the binomial coefficient $$\\binom{2N}{N}.$$ Notice that every prime in the interval $(N,2N]$ appears in the numerator. Then $$\\prod_{N<p\\leq2N}p\\leq\\binom{2N}{N}$$ Since $$\\binom{2N}{N}\\leq(1+1)^{2N}=4^{N},$$ we see that $$\\prod_{N<p\\leq2N}p\\leq4^{N},$$ and hence $\\theta(2N)-\\theta(N)\\leq N\\log4.$ Consider $N$ of the form $N=2^{r}.$ Then we get the list of inequalities: $$\\theta\\left(2\\right)-\\theta\\left(1\\right)\\leq\\log4$$ $$\\theta\\left(4\\right)-\\theta\\left(2\\right)\\leq2\\log4$$ $$\\theta\\left(8\\right)-\\theta\\left(4\\right)\\leq4\\log4$$ $$\\theta(2^{r})-\\theta\\left(2^{r-1}\\right)\\leq2^{r-1}\\log4$$ $$ \\theta\\left(2^{r+1}\\right)-\\theta\\left(2^{r}\\right)\\leq2^{r}\\log4.$$ Summing all of these yields $$\\theta\\left(2^{r+1}\\right)-\\theta\\left(1\\right)\\leq\\left(2^{r}+\\cdots+1\\right)\\log4\\leq2^{r+1}\\log4$$ for each $r$ . For every $x$ in the interval $(2^{r},2^{r+1}]$ we have $\\theta(x)\\leq\\theta(2^{r+1})$ so that $$\\theta(x)\\leq2^{r+1}\\log4\\leq x\\cdot2\\log4<3x$$ since $x>2^{r}$ . Thus the result is proven.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the question according to the specified format. The original question is about proving Chebyshev's result that the sum of (log p)/p from p ≤ n (where p are primes) is asymptotic to log n as n approaches infinity. They also mention its relation to the Prime Number Theorem and are asking about the difficulty of the proof, particularly in comparison to an information-theoretic proof by Kontoyiannis.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem here is to prove the asymptotic equivalence of the sum to log n.\n\nAssumptions would include that p is a prime number, p is less than or equal to n, and n approaches infinity. However, looking at the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the primes p are the objects under consideration, so each assumption should relate to p and n.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n- p is a prime number.\n- p is less than or equal to n.\n- n is a positive integer approaching infinity.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sum of (log p)/p for primes p ≤ n is asymptotic to log n as n tends to infinity.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line and applies to one object. Let me check again. The first assumption is about p being prime. The second is p ≤ n. The third is n approaching infinity. That seems correct. The problem statement then is the sum being asymptotic to log n. The original problem statement in the example included the formula, so here we should present the sum and the asymptotic relation.\n\nYes, this should fit the format. The user's example didn't include all assumptions from the original problem, only the relevant ones. Here, the original problem states \"as n→infty\", so including that as an assumption about n. The primes p are ≤n, so that's another assumption. Each of these is on a separate line, addressing one property each.",
