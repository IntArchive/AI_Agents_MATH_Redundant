    "Content": "Here is my proof of $\\gcd(a,b)=ax+by$ for $a, b, x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Am I doing something wrong? Are there easier proofs? $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, g=\\gcd(a,b)$ and suppose $g \\neq ax + by$. Let $c$ be a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Then $$\\forall x', y' \\in \\mathbb{Z}: c | ax' + by'\\Longrightarrow\\exists q_1, q_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\,\\,\\, s.t.\\,\\,\\, c q_1 = ax' + by'\\,\\,,\\,\\,cq_2 = g$$ So $$gcd(a, b)=g=c q_2 = c q_1 \\frac{q_2}{q_1} = \\left(\\frac{q_2}{q_1}x'\\right)a + \\left(\\frac{q_2}{q_1}y'\\right)b$$ So if we have $q_1|q_2$ then we found $\\gcd(a,b)=ax'+by'$ for all $x', y' \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Now $$\\frac{q_1}{q_2}=\\frac{c q_1}{c q_2} = \\frac{ax'+by'}{g}$$ but $g|a$ and $g|b$ so $\\exists q_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}: \\frac{q_1}{q_2}=q_3 \\Rightarrow q_1=q_2 q_3 \\Rightarrow q_1 | q_2\\,$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "The nicest proof I know is as follows: Consider the set $S = \\{ax+by>0 : a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ .  Let $d = \\min S$ .  We now show the following: $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$ . Any common divisor of $a$ and $b$ must divide $d$ . If we can show those two things then it is trivial that $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ , and therefore that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is of the form $ax+by$ . To show that $d$ divides $a$ and $b$ : suppose for a contradiction that $d$ does not divide $a$ .  Then $a=qd+r$ , where $q\\ge 0$ and $0<r<d$ .  Since $a=qd+r$ , $qd=a-r$ , and since we have that $d=ax+by$ , $q(ax+by)=a-r$ , so $r=a(1-qx)-bqy$ .  So $r$ is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$ , and since $r>0$ , that means that $r\\in S$ .  Since $r<d$ and we had supposed $d$ to be $\\min S$ , we have a contradiction.  So $d$ must divide $a$ . An identical argument proves that $d$ must divide $b$ . We now want to show that any common divisor of $a$ and $b$ must divide $d$ .  This is easy to show: if $a=uc$ and $b=vc$ , then $d=ax+by=c(ux+vy)$ , so $c$ divides $d$ . Therefore, $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ , and is of the form $ax+by$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example given shows that I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question. \n\nLooking at the original problem here: the title is about proving Bezout's identity, which states that the gcd of two numbers can be expressed as a linear combination of those numbers. The user's question includes their attempted proof and asks if they're doing something wrong or if there's an easier proof.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is to prove Bezout's identity, which is gcd(a,b) = ax + by for integers a, b, x, y.\n\nNow, the original problem mentions that a, b, x, y are integers. The user also assumes in their proof that g = gcd(a,b) and that g is not equal to ax + by, leading to a contradiction. However, for the assumptions section, we need to focus on the given conditions of the problem, not the proof steps. \n\nThe key assumptions here are that a and b are integers, and that x and y are integers as well. The problem is to prove that gcd(a,b) can be expressed as ax + by. So the assumptions should list the properties of the objects involved. Each assumption per line. Let me check if there are more conditions. The problem statement doesn't specify any additional constraints like a and b being non-zero or positive, but generally, gcd is defined for integers not both zero. However, since the user's original question doesn't mention this, maybe I shouldn't include it unless it's part of the standard theorem. Bezout's identity usually requires a and b not both zero. But the user's problem statement as written just says a, b, x, y in integers. The standard theorem does have the condition that a and b are not both zero, but the original question here might not state that. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user's question starts with \"a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\" and then proceeds with the proof. So in their problem statement, they don't mention a and b not both zero. However, in the standard Bezout's identity, that's a condition. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe I shouldn't add assumptions not present. Wait, but the problem is to structure the problem as given, filtering unrelated info. The original problem title is \"Proof of gcd(a,b)=ax+by\", and the question body says \"Here is my proof of gcd(a,b)=ax+by for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ. Am I doing something wrong? Are there easier proofs?\"\n\nSo in their problem statement, the user is trying to prove that gcd(a,b) = ax + by where a,b,x,y are integers. But Bezout's identity actually states that there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a,b). The user's phrasing is slightly off because they have the equality for some x and y, not for all x and y. So the problem as stated by the user might have a mistake. However, when structuring the problem, I need to present it as the user has written, unless it's a typo. But perhaps the correct problem is to show that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by, which is the standard Bezout identity. The user's wording says \"for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", which might be incorrect because x and y are existentially quantified, not universally. But the user might have made a mistake here. However, the task is to structure the problem as given. \n\nBut in the assumptions, I need to list the conditions. The problem is to prove gcd(a,b) = ax + by where a, b, x, y are integers. However, in reality, the correct statement is that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by. So the user's problem statement might be incorrect. But since I need to format the problem as presented, not correct it, I have to take their wording. Alternatively, maybe in their problem statement, they meant that there exist x and y such that, but wrote it as for all. Hmm. But the user's own proof attempt seems to use x' and y' and then derive x and y from that, so maybe they are confused between universal and existential quantifiers. \n\nBut for the purposes of the format, the problem is as stated: prove that gcd(a,b) = ax + by for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ. The assumptions would then be that a, b, x, y are integers. Wait, but in Bezout's identity, x and y exist, but they aren't arbitrary. So the problem as stated by the user might be incorrectly formulated. However, the task is to structure the problem as presented, not to correct it. So in this case, the user's problem is: Prove that gcd(a,b) = ax + by for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ. So the assumptions are that a, b, x, y are integers. But the actual Bezout identity requires that there exist integers x and y such that. So the problem as phrased is incorrect, but we have to take it as given. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is an integer,\n- b is an integer,\n- x is an integer,\n- y is an integer.\n\nBut maybe the problem is to show that gcd(a,b) can be expressed as ax + by for some integers x and y, which is the correct statement. But the user wrote \"for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", which would mean for all integers a, b, x, y, which is not true. So there might be a mistake here, but the task is to structure the problem as presented. However, in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, the user didn't mention that. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", not requiring n to be divisible by 7. So the example seems to have a mistake. Therefore, maybe the example is wrong, and the correct approach is to list the assumptions as given in the problem. But in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't there. That might be an error. Wait, maybe the original problem was different? Let me check. The example's original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But this is incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer, not that it's divisible by 7. So the example seems flawed. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to extract all the conditions from the problem statement, even if they are not explicitly listed. But that would be incorrect. Maybe the example was a mistake. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, the correct assumptions are that a and b are integers. But the problem is to prove that gcd(a,b) = ax + by for some integers x and y. However, the user's problem statement says \"for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", which is ambiguous. If it's \"for all a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", the statement is false. If it's \"there exist x, y ∈ ℤ such that\", then it's correct. But the user wrote the problem as \"gcd(a,b)=ax+by\" for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ. So maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement. But as the task is to structure the problem as given, the assumptions would be a, b, x, y are integers, and the problem is to prove gcd(a,b) = ax + by. However, the standard problem is to show existence of x and y, so the user's problem might be misstated. But given that, the formatted problem should reflect the user's original question. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is an integer,\n- b is an integer,\n- x is an integer,\n- y is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that gcd(a, b) = ax + by.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct because the standard Bezout identity requires existence, not for all x and y. However, the user's problem statement is as written. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is misstated, and the correct problem is to prove that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by. In that case, the assumptions would be a and b are integers, and the problem is to prove there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by. \n\nBut given that the user's original problem statement is written as \"gcd(a,b)=ax+by for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", which is technically incorrect, but the task is to structure it as is. Therefore, the assumptions are a, b, x, y are integers. Problem: Prove that gcd(a, b) = ax + by.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's problem is a misstatement, and the correct problem is to prove that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by. In that case, the assumptions would be a and b are integers, and the problem is to prove the existence of x and y. However, in the original question, the user writes \"for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", which suggests all variables are integers. But the problem statement's correctness isn't our concern here; we just need to structure it as per the user's question.\n\nWait, looking again at the example: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. Therefore, the example might be incorrect, but perhaps the user wants to extract hidden assumptions. However, that's not clear. Maybe in the example, the original problem actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but it wasn't stated. Alternatively, maybe the example is wrong, and we should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about Bezout's identity. The standard assumptions for Bezout's identity are that a and b are integers not both zero, and the conclusion is that there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a,b). But in the user's problem statement, they write \"for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", which can be misread as for all a, b, x, y in ℤ, which is false. But more likely, the user intended the correct statement, which is that for any integers a and b (not both zero), there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a,b). However, the user's wording is ambiguous. Given that, but the task is to structure the problem as presented, perhaps we have to take the problem as written.\n\nBut looking at the user's own proof attempt, they start with \"a,b ∈ ℤ, g = gcd(a,b)\" and then suppose g ≠ ax + by. So in their proof, they are assuming that a and b are integers, and trying to show that g can be expressed as ax + by. Therefore, the problem, as per their proof attempt, is: Given integers a and b, prove that gcd(a,b) can be expressed as ax + by for some integers x and y. So the problem statement should be: Prove that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by. But the user's original title is \"Proof of gcd(a,b)=ax+by\", and in the question, they write \"Here is my proof of gcd(a,b)=ax+by for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ.\" So perhaps they meant \"for some x, y ∈ ℤ\", but wrote \"for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\". \n\nIn this case, to structure the problem correctly, despite the user's wording, we might need to adjust it to match the standard Bezout's identity, but the task is to structure the problem as given. However, perhaps the user's problem is indeed misstated, but we have to represent it as is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write \"Prove that gcd(a,b) can be expressed as ax + by where a, b are integers and x, y are integers.\" In that case, the assumptions would be that a and b are integers, and the problem is to prove that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by. \n\nBut given the user's exact wording: \"gcd(a,b)=ax+by for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", the natural reading is that for all a, b, x, y in ℤ, gcd(a,b) equals ax + by, which is false. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. However, the task is to format it as given. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's problem is to show that the gcd(a,b) is equal to the set of all linear combinations ax + by, but the minimal positive one. But the wording is \"gcd(a,b)=ax+by\", which is a specific equation. \n\nGiven that the user's proof attempt seems to be following the standard proof of Bezout's identity, where they assume that g is the gcd and then show that the minimal positive linear combination is equal to g, despite their initial wording, the correct problem is to prove that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- a is an integer,\n- b is an integer,\n- a and b are not both zero.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a, b) = ax + by.\n\nBut in the user's original question, they don't mention that a and b are not both zero, but it's a standard requirement for Bezout. However, the user's problem statement as written doesn't include that, so perhaps we shouldn't add it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's problem is as stated, even if it's incorrect, and we have to present it as such. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering the example provided where assumptions were added beyond the original problem statement (like n divisible by 7), perhaps the task is to extract implicit assumptions. But in the example, it seems incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user wants to list all the assumptions mentioned in the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, the original example's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended that. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, the assumptions should include that a and b are integers (as given) and perhaps other implicit conditions. But without more information, it's hard to tell. \n\nConsidering all that, the safest approach is to list the assumptions as given in the problem statement. The problem statement says \"for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", so the assumptions are:\n\n- a is an integer,\n- b is an integer,\n- x is an integer,\n- y is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that gcd(a, b) = ax + by.\n\nHowever, this is incorrect because gcd(a,b) is not equal to ax + by for all integers x and y. But since the user's problem statement is written that way, we have to structure it as such. Alternatively, if the user intended to ask for the existence of x and y, then the assumptions are a and b are integers, and the problem is to prove there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by. \n\nGiven the user's proof attempt, which starts with \"a, b ∈ ℤ, g = gcd(a,b)\" and supposes g ≠ ax + by, then proceeds to derive a contradiction, it seems the user is trying to prove the existence of such x and y. Therefore, the problem should be to prove that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by. Hence, the assumptions are a and b are integers, and the problem is to prove the existence. \n\nBut the user's wording says \"for a, b, x, y ∈ ℤ\", which is ambiguous. To resolve this, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\n- a is an integer,\n- b is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist integers x and y such that gcd(a, b) = ax + by.\n\nThis aligns with the standard Bezout's identity and the user's proof attempt, which focuses on a and b being integers and the existence of x and y. Therefore, despite the user's ambiguous wording, structuring it this way would be more accurate. \n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should have assumptions that a and b are integers, and the problem is to prove the existence of x and y such that gcd(a,b) = ax + by.",
