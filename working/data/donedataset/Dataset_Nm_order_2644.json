    "Content": "The problem I am considering stated formally is this: Show that if a sequence in $\\ell_\\infty^*$ is weak*-convergent, then it is also weakly convergent.\nWe may reduce this to the case where the sequence is weak$^*$-null, and show that it is weakly null. This is a special case of a result of Grothendieck from the 50's.  It is an internal characterization of what is now called a Grothendieck space. A Banach space $X$ is Grothendieck if every weak$^*$-convergent sequence in $X^*$ is weakly convergent. In his \"resume,\" Grothendieck proves that $C(K)$ for $K$ an extremally disconnected (also called Stonian) compact space satisfies this property.  Since we can represent $\\ell_\\infty$ as $C(\\beta\\mathbb{N})$, the space of continuous functions on the Stone-Cech compactification of the natural numbers (which is Stonian), it satisfies this property. So my questions are 1) If you know the general technique to show this property for $C(K)$ spaces as mentioned above could you give me a brief indication, and also 2) Is there something in this particular example that might make it easier to deal with than general $C(K)$? Either way I assume we have to be able to either work blindly with elements of $\\ell_\\infty^{**}$ since we can't well characterize it, or there may be some other way to show weak convergence.  (Or I also think we can say in more modern language that $\\ell_\\infty^{**}$ whatever it is is a von Neumann algebra if that is helpful at all).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a summary of Grothendieck's argument taken from Théorème 9 on page 168 in Sur les applications linéaires faiblement compactes d'espaces du type $C(K)$ , Canadian J. Math. 5 (1953), pp. 129–173. He also outlines a similar argument in Exercise 12 2) to part IV of chapter 4 of his book Topological Vector Spaces (page 229 of the 1973 Gordon and Breach edition). Very briefly, the original proof uses a few reductions: first reducing from a general $C(K)$ space with $K$ extremally disconnected to the case of $\\ell^{\\infty}(S) = C(\\beta S)$ (we can take $S = K_\\delta$ , the set underlying $K$ equipped with the discrete topology); then apply Grothendieck's criterion for weak compactness of sets of measures, which allows to reduce to the case of $\\ell^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{N})$ and finally conclude by applying a result due to Phillips on finitely additive measures on $\\mathbb{N}$ to conclude. The result on the Grothendieck property of $\\ell^\\infty$ is essentially this lemma of Phillips, so it is substantially easier but at the same time it is a basic ingredient of Grothendieck's argument. So here's the summary in more detail: Recall that $C(K)$ is isometrically injective if (and only if!) $K$ is extremally disconnected. This means that $C(K)$ is $1$ -complemented in every space containing it. This is proved e.g. as Theorems 4.3.6 and 4.3.7, pp. 81ff in Albiac–Kalton, Topics in Banach space theory . This tells us that $C(K)$ is $1$ -complemented in $\\ell^\\infty(K)$ , the space of bounded functions on $K$ . Let us fix a decomposition $\\ell^{\\infty}(K) = C(K) \\oplus Z$ , and assume now that we have a sequence $\\mu_n$ in $M(K) = C(K)^\\ast$ converging to zero in the weak $^\\ast$ -topology. The fixed decomposition of $\\ell^{\\infty}(K)$ allows us to consider this as a sequence of functionals $\\mu_n \\in \\ell^{\\infty}(K)^\\ast$ satisfying $\\mu_n(f) \\to 0$ for all $f \\in \\ell^{\\infty}(K)$ . In other words, we can now consider $\\mu_n$ as a weak $^\\ast$ -convergent sequence of measures in $\\beta K_\\delta$ , the Stone–Čech compactification of the discrete space $K_\\delta$ . We are now in position to apply Grothendieck's weak compactness criterion for $M(X)$ where $X$ is locally compact to the sequence $\\mu_i$ of measures on $C(\\beta K_\\delta)$ (this is Theorem 2 on page 146 of G.'s article mentioned at the beginning; see also Theorem 5.3.2 on page 112 of Albiac–Kalton): If $\\mu_i$ would not converge weakly to zero, we could find $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$ , a subsequence $(\\mu_j)_{j \\in J}$ and sequence of pairwise disjoint clopen sets $U_j$ such that $|\\mu_j(U_j)| \\geq \\varepsilon$ . Since characteristic functions of clopen sets are continuous, we can translate this back to $\\ell^\\infty(K)$ and get a sequence of finitely additive measures $\\mu_j$ on $K$ and pairwise disjoint subsets $V_j \\subset K$ such that $|\\mu_j(V_j)| \\geq \\varepsilon$ . This will lead to a contradiction: Define $\\nu_j \\in \\ell^{\\infty}(J)^\\ast$ to be the finitely additive measure $\\nu_j(B) = \\mu_j\\left( \\bigcup_{b \\in B} V_b\\right)$ for all $B \\subset J$ . The hypothesis on the sequence $\\mu_i$ implies that $\\nu_j(B) \\to 0$ for all $B \\subset J$ . With Lemma 3.3 on page 525 of Phillips, On linear transformations , Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 48 (1940), 516–541 this leads to $$\\lim_{j \\to \\infty} \\sum_{b \\in J} |\\nu_j(b)| = 0,$$ so in particular we have $|\\nu_j(j)| \\to 0$ , which contradicts $|\\nu_j(j)| = |\\mu_j(A_j)| \\geq \\varepsilon$ for all $j  \\in J$ . I don't know much about operator algebras, but this argument here looks like a rather direct attack on the problem and I don't think that the result would become any easier or more transparent by using operator algebra methods; hopefully someone more familiar with such reformulations will be able to contradict my assessment.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original problem is about showing that a sequence in the dual space of ℓ∞ (which is ℓ∞*) that is weak*-convergent is also weakly convergent. The user mentions reducing it to the weak*-null case and proving it's weakly null. They reference Grothendieck spaces and specifically ℓ∞ as C(βℕ), a C(K) space with K Stonian.\n\nI need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. Considering a sequence in ℓ∞^* (the dual space of ℓ∞).\n2. The sequence is weak*-convergent.\n3. The space ℓ∞ is a Grothendieck space, which by definition means every weak*-convergent sequence in its dual is weakly convergent. But the problem is to show this property for ℓ∞, so maybe the assumption is that ℓ∞ is a C(K) space with K Stonian (extremally disconnected). However, the problem is to prove the property, so the assumption might be that K is Stonian, hence C(K) has the Grothendieck property.\n\nWait, the problem is to show that if a sequence in ℓ∞^* is weak*-convergent, then it's weakly convergent. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The user also mentions that ℓ∞ can be represented as C(βℕ), which is a C(K) space where K is Stonian. So perhaps the assumptions are that we're working within the context of C(K) where K is Stonian, and hence ℓ∞ (as such a space) has this property.\n\nBut the original problem statement is more specific: it's about ℓ∞, not a general C(K). The user is asking for help in proving this for ℓ∞, possibly using its structure as C(βℕ) with βℕ being Stonian.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\n1. The space considered is ℓ∞.\n2. A sequence in ℓ∞^* is weak*-convergent.\n3. βℕ (the Stone-Cech compactification of ℕ) is a Stonian compact space.\n4. ℓ∞ is isometrically isomorphic to C(βℕ).\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated is to prove that weak*-convergent sequences in ℓ∞^* are weakly convergent. The assumptions needed are the properties of ℓ∞ that allow this. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking to show this property, so the assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem, not the reasons why it's true. But the example given in the user's example includes assumptions like \"n is divisible by 7\", which were part of the problem's hypotheses. In the original problem here, the main assumption is that we have a sequence in ℓ∞^* that is weak*-convergent, and we need to prove it's weakly convergent. But perhaps there's an implicit assumption that ℓ∞ is a Grothendieck space because it's C(K) with K Stonian. However, the problem is to show that ℓ∞ has this property, so maybe the assumptions are the properties that make ℓ∞ a Grothendieck space, like being C(K) with K extremally disconnected.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had assumptions that were part of the problem's hypotheses, not the solution. So in the original problem, the assumptions would be the hypotheses under which the problem is posed. In this case, the problem is: \"Show that if a sequence in ℓ_∞^* is weak*-convergent, then it is also weakly convergent.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- A sequence is in ℓ_∞^*.\n- The sequence is weak*-convergent.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that this sequence is weakly convergent.\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's condition. So here, the problem's condition is that we have a sequence in ℓ_∞^* that is weak*-convergent. So the assumptions should list those conditions.\n\nHowever, the user's example also included an assumption that n is an integer, which was perhaps part of the original problem's setup. So in this case, the problem is about sequences in ℓ_∞^*, so perhaps the assumption is that we are working within the dual space of ℓ_∞, and considering sequences there that are weak*-convergent.\n\nBut the problem as stated is: \"Show that if a sequence in ℓ_∞^* is weak*-convergent, then it is also weakly convergent.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n1. The space is ℓ_∞^*.\n2. A sequence in ℓ_∞^* is weak*-convergent.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, the problem is to show that ℓ_∞ is a Grothendieck space, meaning that every weak*-convergent sequence in its dual (which is ℓ_∞^**) is weakly convergent. Wait, no. Wait, the dual of ℓ_∞ is complicated, but the problem states \"a sequence in ℓ_∞^* is weak*-convergent\". Wait, ℓ_∞^* is the dual of ℓ_∞, so the weak*-topology on ℓ_∞^* is the topology induced by ℓ_∞. But Grothendieck spaces are spaces X such that every weak*-convergent sequence in X^* is weakly convergent. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the definition given in the problem: A Banach space X is Grothendieck if every weak*-convergent sequence in X^* is weakly convergent. So ℓ_∞ is such a space. Therefore, the problem is to show that ℓ_∞ is a Grothendieck space, i.e., any weak*-convergent sequence in ℓ_∞^* is weakly convergent.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. X is the Banach space ℓ_∞.\n2. A sequence in X^* (which is ℓ_∞^*) is weak*-convergent.\n\nBut the problem is to show that this sequence is weakly convergent in X^*.\n\nHowever, the user's question also mentions that ℓ_∞ can be represented as C(βℕ), which is a C(K) space with K Stonian (extremally disconnected), and that Grothendieck proved that C(K) spaces with K Stonian have this property.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is to use this representation to prove that ℓ_∞ is Grothendieck. Therefore, the assumptions would include that ℓ_∞ is C(K) with K Stonian.\n\nBut the problem as stated is \"Show that if a sequence in ℓ_∞^* is weak*-convergent, then it is also weakly convergent.\" So the problem is to prove this implication. The assumptions leading to this would be the properties of ℓ_∞, but in the problem statement, the user is to prove this, so the assumptions for the problem would be the given conditions: the sequence is in ℓ_∞^* and is weak*-convergent.\n\nBut the example given by the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's hypothesis. So in this case, the problem's hypothesis is that we have a sequence in ℓ_∞^* that is weak*-convergent. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. The space is ℓ_∞^*.\n2. A sequence in ℓ_∞^* is weak*-convergent.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since ℓ_∞ is a specific space, the assumption is that we are working within the context of ℓ_∞ and its dual. But the problem is general for any such sequence. So the assumptions are:\n\n- A sequence is in the dual space of ℓ_∞ (i.e., ℓ_∞^*).\n- The sequence is weak*-convergent in ℓ_∞^*.\n\nThen the problem is to show that this sequence is also weakly convergent in ℓ_∞^*.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show that ℓ_∞ is a Grothendieck space, the assumptions might be that ℓ_∞ is a C(K) space with K Stonian. But the problem statement is phrased as proving the implication for sequences in ℓ_∞^*, so the assumptions are about the sequence, not the space. However, the example given by the user included assumptions about the object (n being an integer and divisible by 7), which are part of the problem's conditions. So here, the conditions are the sequence being in ℓ_∞^* and being weak*-convergent.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nA sequence is in $\\ell_\\infty^*$,\nThe sequence is weak*-convergent.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence is also weakly convergent.\n\nBut the original problem statement mentions reducing to the case where the sequence is weak*-null. However, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be as per the problem's explicit conditions, not the solution steps. So the main assumptions are the ones given in the problem statement, which are that the sequence is in ℓ_∞^* and is weak*-convergent. The problem is to show it's weakly convergent.\n\nHowever, the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's hypothesis. In this case, the problem's hypothesis is that we have a sequence in ℓ_∞^* that is weak*-convergent. So the assumptions are:\n\n- The space considered is $\\ell_\\infty$.\n- A sequence in $\\ell_\\infty^*$ is weak*-convergent.\n\nWait, the problem is about sequences in ℓ_∞^*, so maybe the space is ℓ_∞^*, but the Grothendieck property is about the space X (ℓ_∞) such that in its dual X^*, weak*-convergent sequences are weakly convergent. So the assumption is that X is ℓ_∞, and we're looking at sequences in X^*. But the problem statement is to show that such sequences are weakly convergent if they are weak*-convergent. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- $X = \\ell_\\infty$,\n- A sequence in $X^*$ is weak*-convergent.\n\nBut the user's example didn't include the space as an assumption, just the properties of the object (n being integer and divisible by 7). So maybe here, the assumptions are:\n\n- The Banach space is $\\ell_\\infty$,\n- A sequence in $\\ell_\\infty^*$ is weak*-convergent.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, the problem is to show that ℓ_∞ is a Grothendieck space, which by definition means that any weak*-convergent sequence in its dual is weakly convergent. Therefore, the problem is to prove that ℓ_∞ is a Grothendieck space, with the assumption that ℓ_∞ is a C(K) space with K Stonian. But the problem as stated is \"Show that if a sequence in ℓ_∞^* is weak*-convergent, then it is also weakly convergent.\" So the assumptions are inherent in the problem's setup, not in the properties used to prove it. The user is asking for the proof, so the formatted problem's assumptions should be the given conditions in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- A sequence is in $\\ell_\\infty^*$,\n- The sequence is weak*-convergent.\n\nProblem: Show that the sequence is also weakly convergent.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's hypothesis. Here, the problem's hypothesis is that we have a sequence in ℓ_∞^* that is weak*-convergent, so those are the assumptions. Additionally, the problem might assume that ℓ_∞ is represented as C(βℕ), which is a C(K) space with K Stonian, but that's part of the solution, not the problem's assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nA sequence is in $\\ell_\\infty^*$,\nThe sequence is weak*-convergent.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence is weakly convergent.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions reducing to the weak*-null case. However, that's part of the solution approach, not the problem's assumptions. The problem as stated is to show the implication for any weak*-convergent sequence, so the assumptions are just the two points above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is that ℓ_∞ is a Grothendieck space, but the problem is to prove that it is, so that would not be an assumption. Therefore, the correct answer is as above.",
