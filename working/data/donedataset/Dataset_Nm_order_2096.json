    "Content": "On an important book of Machine Learning, I've found this proof. We want to minimize the cost function $J_0(X_0)$ defined by the formula\n$$J_0(x_0) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|x_0 - x_k \\|^2.$$ The solution to this problem is given by $x_0=m$, where $m$ is the sample mean $m = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^nx_k$. Proof. $$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nJ_0(x_0) & = & \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|(x_0 - m)-(x_k - m) \\|^2 \\\\\n & = & \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|x_0 - m \\|^2 -2(x_0-m)^T\\sum_{k=1}^n(x_k-m) + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|x_k - m \\|^2 \\\\\n & = & \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|x_0 - m \\|^2 + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|x_k - m \\|^2.\n\\end{array}$$ Since $ \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|x_k - m \\|^2  $ is independent of $x_0$, this expression is obviously minimized by $x_0=m$. I cannot understand this proof. What does assure that $ \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|x_k - m \\|^2  $ is minimized?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I believe that this expression is constant. The only variable anywhere in sight is $x_0$. You are supposed to pick $x_0$ that minimizes $J_0(x_0)$. The only expression involving $x_0$ is nonnegative, so it is minimized if it is zero. Choosing $x_0=m$ does this because\n$$J_0(x_0) = \\underbrace{\\sum_{k=1}^n \\|x_0 - m \\|^2}_{\\textrm{zero when }x_0=m} + \\underbrace{\\sum_{k=1}^n \\|x_k - m \\|^2}_{\\textrm{constant w.r.t. }x_0}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the problem. The original problem is about proving that the mean minimizes the squared error function. \n\nLooking at the problem statement: The cost function J_0 is defined as the sum of squared distances from a point x_0 to each x_k. The goal is to show that the minimum occurs when x_0 is the sample mean m. The proof provided expands the squared norm into three terms. The key steps involve expanding the expression and showing that two terms cancel out, leaving one term that's independent of x_0. \n\nNow, for the assumptions. The problem states that we're dealing with vectors x_0 and x_k, and the norm used is the Euclidean norm (since it's standard in such contexts unless specified otherwise). The sample mean m is defined as the average of the x_k's. The critical assumption here is that the cross-term involving the sum of (x_k - m) cancels out, which relies on the property of the mean. Specifically, the sum of (x_k - m) over k is zero. This is a crucial point because if that sum weren't zero, the middle term wouldn't vanish, and the proof wouldn't hold. \n\nAnother assumption is that the problem is in a real vector space, given the use of transpose (^T) in the cross-term, indicating dot products. Also, the variables are vectors, not scalars, so the norm squared is the dot product of the vector with itself. The independence of the last term from x_0 is another key point, allowing the minimization to depend only on the first term, which is minimized when x_0 equals m.\n\nSo, listing each assumption line by line:\n\n1. x_0 is a vector in a real vector space.\n2. Each x_k is a vector in the same real vector space.\n3. The norm used is the Euclidean norm (L2 norm).\n4. m is defined as the sample mean: m = (1/n)Σx_k.\n5. The sum Σ(x_k - m) from k=1 to n equals the zero vector.\n6. The term Σ||x_k - m||² is independent of x_0.\n\nEach of these addresses a single property or condition applied to one object. The problem then is to prove that x_0 = m minimizes J_0(x_0).",
