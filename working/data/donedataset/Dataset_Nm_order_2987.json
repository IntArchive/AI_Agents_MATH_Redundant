    "Content": "Let a and b be natural numbers so that $2a-1,2b-1$ and $a+b$ are prime numbers. Prove that $a+b$ can't divide $a^a+b^b$ nor $a^b+b^a$. I get that $gcd(a,b)=1$.\nI haven't got anything special for now but if I do I will update the question.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $2a-1, 2b-1$ are primes, then $a,b\\neq 1$. Since $a+b$ is a prime, then we can suppose $a$ is even and $b$ is odd. Suppose $p=a+b|a^a+b^b$. We have: $$a^a+b^b\\equiv a^a-a^b=a^b(a^{a-b}-1) \\pmod {a+b}$$ Since $\\gcd(a^b,a+b)=1$, then $p|a^{a-b}-1$. Let $h=ord_p(a)$, then $h|p-1,h|a-b$, then $h|p-1-(a-b)=2b-1$, thus $h=1$ or $h=2b-1$. If $h=1$, then $a+b|a-1$, but this is impossible since $a+b>a-1$. Then $h=2b-1$, which means $p|a^{2b-1}-1$. Hence $p|a^{2a-1}(a^{2b-1}-1)=a^{2a+2b-2}-2^{2a-1}$, then $p|2^{2a-1}-1$. Thus $2b-1|2a-1$, or $2a-1=2b-1$ (since they are both primes), or $a=b$, which is impossible. Proving $a+b \\not|a^b+b^a$ is similar.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by carefully reading the original problem to understand all the assumptions and the main question.\n\nThe problem states: Let a and b be natural numbers so that 2a−1, 2b−1, and a+b are prime numbers. We need to prove that a+b can't divide either a^a + b^b or a^b + b^a. Additionally, the user mentions that gcd(a, b) = 1, which they derived but isn't part of the original problem's given conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The problem gives three conditions: 2a−1 is prime, 2b−1 is prime, and a+b is prime. Each of these should be a separate assumption. Also, a and b are natural numbers. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is a natural number.\n2. b is a natural number.\n3. 2a - 1 is a prime number.\n4. 2b - 1 is a prime number.\n5. a + b is a prime number.\n\nThe problem then asks to prove that a+b doesn't divide a^a + b^b or a^b + b^a. The gcd part is something the user figured out, so it's not an original assumption. Therefore, I shouldn't include it in the assumptions list.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"I get that gcd(a,b)=1\" but that's their own deduction, not part of the given problem. So the original problem's assumptions are just the five points above. The problem statement as given is: Prove that a+b can't divide a^a + b^b nor a^b + b^a.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\na is a natural number,\nb is a natural number,\n2a - 1 is a prime number,\n2b - 1 is a prime number,\na + b is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a + b can't divide a^a + b^b nor a^b + b^a.\n\nI need to check if all the original problem's conditions are covered. The original problem states that a and b are natural numbers with 2a−1, 2b−1, and a+b being primes. Yes, each of those is a separate condition. So each should be a line in the assumption. The problem is to show that a+b doesn't divide either of those two expressions. That's the problem statement.\n\nI should make sure that each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So for example, \"2a - 1 is a prime number\" applies to the expression 2a -1, which relates to a. Similarly for 2b -1. The a + b being prime is another condition. So the five assumptions are correct.\n\nThe problem is exactly as stated. The user's mention of gcd(a, b)=1 is their own finding, so it's not part of the problem's given assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should only include the original assumptions provided in the question.",
