    "Content": "I'm doing a bit of self study, but I'm uncomfortable with a certain idea. I want to show that $f(z)$ is analytic if and only if $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ is analytic, and by analytic I mean differentiable at each point. Here $f$ is a complex valued function. What I do is write $f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$, where $u$ and $v$ are real functions of two variables. Then $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}=u(x,-y)-iv(x,-y)$. These two forms look very similar, in the sense the one function being differentiable should immediately imply the other is differentiable, since the only thing really changing might be a $-$ sign popping out due to the chain rule. How can I more rigorously express that $f(z)$ is analytic iff $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ using this? Many thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Define $g(z)=\\overline{f(\\overline z)}$.  Then note that $f(z)=\\overline{g(\\overline z)}$, so there is symmetry allowing only one implication to be shown directly.  Suppose that $f$ is analytic.  Then for all $z$, $$\\begin{align*}g'(z)&=\\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0}\\frac{g(z+h)-g(z)}{h}\\\\\n&=\\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\overline{f(\\overline{z+h})}-\\overline{f(\\overline z)}}{h}\\\\\n&=\\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0}\\overline{\\left( \\frac{f(\\overline z+\\overline h)-f(\\overline z)}{\\overline h} \\right)    }\\\\\n&=\\overline{\\left( \\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(\\overline z+\\overline h)-f(\\overline z)}{\\overline h} \\right)    }\\\\\n&=\\overline{f'(\\overline z)}.\n\\end{align*}$$ That is, $g$ is differentiable, with $g'(z)=\\overline{f'(\\overline z)}$. Alternatively, as other answers have indicated, you could check that the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold for $g$ if they hold for $f$, with $f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ and $g(x+iy)=u(x,-y)+i(-v(x,-y))$ as you indicated. Another perhaps more conceptual way to think of this is that complex analytic maps are conformal (where their derivatives are nonzero), preserving orientation and angles.  Complex conjugation preserves angles but reverses orientation.  Reversing orientation twice gets you back where you started, so the result is that $g$ is conformal.  (I have given an idea here rather than anything close to a rigorous proof.) Another approach is to look at power series expansions.  If $f$ has power series expansion in a neighborhood of $\\overline{c}$, $\\displaystyle{f(z)=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^\\infty a_k(z-\\overline c)^k}$, then in a neighborhood of $c$, $g$ has the power series expansion $\\displaystyle{g(z)=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^\\infty\\overline{a_k}(z-c)^k}$.  That is, you just conjugate the coefficients and conjugate the base point for the expansion.  This shows that $g$ is analytic if $f$ is.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to show that f(z) is analytic if and only if the conjugate of f(conjugate z) is analytic. They mentioned using the representation of f(z) as u(x,y) + iv(x,y), and then flipping the sign of y in both u and v, and also changing the sign of the imaginary part.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a function to be analytic. Analytic here means complex differentiable at each point in a neighborhood, right? So differentiability in the complex sense, which is stricter than real differentiability because it requires satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nThe user's approach is to express f(z) as u(x,y) + iv(x,y), and then when you take conjugate of f(conjugate z), you get u(x,-y) - iv(x,-y). Let's denote this new function as g(z) = u(x,-y) - iv(x,-y). They need to show that f is analytic iff g is analytic.\n\nTo show equivalence, we need to prove both directions: if f is analytic, then g is analytic, and vice versa.\n\nStarting with the forward direction: assume f is analytic. Then, f satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. That is, the partial derivatives of u and v satisfy u_x = v_y and u_y = -v_x.\n\nNow, for g(z) = u(x,-y) - iv(x,-y), let's write g(z) = U(x,y) + iV(x,y), where U(x,y) = u(x,-y) and V(x,y) = -v(x,-y). To check if g is analytic, we need to verify the Cauchy-Riemann equations for U and V.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives of U and V. Let's see:\n\nFirst, U_x = partial derivative of u(x,-y) with respect to x, which is u_x(x,-y).\n\nU_y = partial derivative of u(x,-y) with respect to y. Since the second argument is -y, this would be -u_y(x,-y).\n\nSimilarly, V_x = partial derivative of -v(x,-y) with respect to x = -v_x(x,-y).\n\nV_y = partial derivative of -v(x,-y) with respect to y = -(-v_y(x,-y)) = v_y(x,-y).\n\nNow, the Cauchy-Riemann equations for g require that U_x = V_y and U_y = -V_x.\n\nPlugging in the derivatives:\n\nU_x = u_x(x,-y)\nV_y = v_y(x,-y)\nBut since f is analytic, u_x = v_y (from f's Cauchy-Riemann equations). So u_x(x,-y) = v_y(x,-y). Hence, U_x = V_y.\n\nNext, U_y = -u_y(x,-y)\n-V_x = -(-v_x(x,-y)) = v_x(x,-y)\nFrom f's Cauchy-Riemann equations, u_y = -v_x. So substituting, -u_y(x,-y) = -(-v_x(x,-y)) = v_x(x,-y). Therefore, U_y = -V_x.\n\nThus, if f is analytic, then g satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. But we also need to check if the partial derivatives are continuous, right? Because analyticity requires not just satisfying Cauchy-Riemann but also differentiability in the real sense, which needs continuous partial derivatives. If f is analytic, then u and v have continuous partial derivatives, so U and V, being compositions with sign changes and coordinates, would also have continuous partial derivatives. Therefore, g is analytic.\n\nConversely, suppose g is analytic. Then, we need to show that f is analytic. But g(z) is defined as conjugate(f(conj(z))). So if g is analytic, then applying the same transformation again should give us back f. Let's see: applying the transformation to g, we get conjugate(g(conj(z))) = conjugate( conjugate(f(z)) ) = f(z). So if g is analytic, then by the forward direction, conjugate(g(conj(z))) is analytic, which is f(z). Therefore, f is analytic.\n\nAlternatively, we can do it directly by assuming g is analytic and then showing f's Cauchy-Riemann equations hold. Let's try that.\n\nIf g is analytic, then U and V satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. So U_x = V_y and U_y = -V_x.\n\nBut U = u(x,-y), V = -v(x,-y). So as before:\n\nU_x = u_x(x,-y)\nV_y = derivative of -v(x,-y) w.r. to y = v_y(x,-y)\nSo U_x = V_y implies u_x(x,-y) = v_y(x,-y)\n\nSimilarly, U_y = -u_y(x,-y)\nV_x = -v_x(x,-y)\nSo U_y = -V_x implies -u_y(x,-y) = -(-v_x(x,-y)) => -u_y(x,-y) = v_x(x,-y) => u_y(x,-y) = -v_x(x,-y)\n\nNow, to get the Cauchy-Riemann equations for f, which are u_x(x,y) = v_y(x,y) and u_y(x,y) = -v_x(x,y). \n\nBut from g being analytic, we have u_x(x,-y) = v_y(x,-y) and u_y(x,-y) = -v_x(x,-y). \n\nLet me make a substitution here. Let y' = -y. Then, for any y, we can write:\n\nu_x(x, y') = v_y(x, y') when y' = -y. Similarly, u_y(x, y') = -v_x(x, y'). But this holds for all y', so replacing y' with y, we have u_x(x,y) = v_y(x,y) and u_y(x,y) = -v_x(x,y). Hence, f satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations everywhere. Therefore, f is analytic.\n\nTherefore, both directions hold, so f is analytic iff conjugate(f(conj(z))) is analytic.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote \"analytic if and only if $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ is analytic\". So the key step is transforming the function by conjugating the input and the output, and then showing the analyticity is preserved in both directions. The core idea is that applying this transformation flips the y-coordinate and the sign of the imaginary part, which affects the partial derivatives in a way that preserves the Cauchy-Riemann equations if and only if the original function satisfies them.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be about f being a complex-valued function, defined on some domain, and the problem is to show the equivalence of analyticity between f(z) and its conjugate reflection.\n\nBut according to the format, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem mentions that f is a complex-valued function. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a complex-valued function.\n- Analyticity is defined as differentiability at each point in the domain.\n\nBut maybe there's an implicit assumption about the domain being symmetric with respect to the real axis? Because if we take conjugate z, then the domain of f must be such that if z is in the domain, then conjugate z is also in the domain. Otherwise, the function $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ might not be defined everywhere. However, the original problem doesn't specify this. So perhaps the user is assuming that f is defined on a domain that is closed under conjugation. But since the user didn't mention it, maybe it's part of the problem's hidden assumptions?\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, perhaps the assumptions would include that f is a complex-valued function, and maybe that the domain is open and closed under conjugation. However, since the user didn't specify, maybe we don't need to list that? Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was actually part of the problem's requirement. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's not correct, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was wrong. Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem is for every integer n, so the formatted problem shouldn't have \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would change the problem. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the task is to structure the given problem according to the user's format.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is: \"Show that f(z) is analytic if and only if $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ is analytic.\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n- f is a complex-valued function.\n- Analyticity is defined as differentiability at each point (in the complex sense).\n- The domain of f is closed under complex conjugation (so that $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ is defined wherever f is defined).\n\nBut the original question didn't mention the domain, so maybe we shouldn't assume it unless necessary. However, without the domain being closed under conjugation, the function $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ might not be defined on the same domain. Therefore, the problem might implicitly assume that the domain is symmetric (like an open set that is closed under conjugation). But since the user didn't specify, perhaps we should list that as an assumption? Or maybe not. Since the user is asking for the equivalence, maybe the domain is given to be such that z is in the domain iff conjugate z is. So in the problem, perhaps we need to include that assumption.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem doesn't state certain assumptions, they are added. For example, in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, that seems like the example was actually modifying the problem. Because the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem changed it to assuming n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake.\n\nBut regardless, the task here is to format the given problem into Assumptions and Problem. For the current problem:\n\nTitle: How do I rigorously show f(z) is analytic if and only if $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ is?\n\nQuestion content: They define analytic as differentiable at each point, f is complex-valued. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a complex-valued function.\n- Analyticity (differentiable at each point in the domain) is the definition used.\n- The domain of f is closed under complex conjugation (so that if z is in the domain, then so is $\\bar{z}$).\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention the domain, but to define $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$, the domain must be closed under conjugation. Therefore, that's an implicit assumption. So, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. f is a complex-valued function.\n2. The domain of f is closed under complex conjugation (i.e., for all z in the domain, $\\bar{z}$ is also in the domain).\n3. Analyticity is defined as complex differentiability at each point in the domain.\n\nBut the original problem states \"differentiable at each point\", so maybe we don't need to list the domain closure unless necessary. Alternatively, since the problem is as stated, maybe the key assumptions are just that f is complex-valued and analyticity is defined as differentiability everywhere. However, to have $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ defined, the domain must be closed under conjugation. So perhaps that's a necessary assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is local: for each point z, if f is analytic at z, then $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ is analytic at z, which would require that $\\bar{z}$ is in the domain when z is. But without global assumptions, maybe it's about being analytic on the entire domain. Hmm.\n\nBut since the user didn't specify the domain, perhaps the problem is intended to be on a domain that's symmetric, like the entire complex plane, or an open set that's conjugate symmetric. So the assumption would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is a complex-valued function defined on a domain Ω.\n- Ω is closed under complex conjugation (if z ∈ Ω, then $\\bar{z}$ ∈ Ω).\n- Analyticity of f means f is complex differentiable at every point in Ω.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that f(z) is analytic if and only if $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ is analytic.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state these assumptions, so maybe the user didn't consider them. However, to properly structure the problem, these are necessary.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about local analyticity at each point, then the assumption would be that for each z, $\\bar{z}$ is also in the domain. But perhaps the problem is stated in a way that these are given.\n\nGiven the example where assumptions were added even if not present in the original problem, perhaps here we need to list:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is a complex-valued function.\n- For every z in the domain of f, $\\bar{z}$ is also in the domain.\n- Analyticity is defined as complex differentiable at each point in the domain.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that f(z) is analytic if and only if $\\overline{f(\\bar{z})}$ is analytic.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention the domain closure, but without it, the \"if and only if\" might not hold. Therefore, to make the problem well-posed, the domain must be closed under conjugation, which is an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should include these assumptions.",
