    "Content": "I have shown that two of the three elementary operations will not change the image of the row space of the matrix: given a row vector $\\vec{v}$, $k\\vec{v}$ will span the same (scalar multiplication), and switching the order of the rows won't change anything because the span of the row vectors will be the same (vectors will be in a different order). However, how would one show that adding/subtracting vectors does not change the row space?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and present it with Assumptions and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original question. The title is about why elementary matrix operations don't affect the row space. The user has already considered scalar multiplication and row swapping, which they say don't change the row space. Now they're asking specifically about the third operation: adding/subtracting vectors (which I assume means row addition, like adding a multiple of one row to another). They want to show that this operation also doesn't change the row space.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that adding a multiple of one row to another doesn't alter the row space. The original problem mentions the user has already handled scalar multiplication and row swapping. So the assumptions here would be the properties of elementary row operations related to row space. Wait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is more about operations on a matrix.\n\nHmm. The user's example had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in this case, the problem is about row operations. The key assumptions here would be the definitions of elementary row operations and perhaps that the row space is the span of the rows. But maybe the user is looking for the core assumptions needed to approach the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is \"show that adding/subtracting vectors does not change the row space\". So the assumptions would be related to the context of the problem. Let me parse the question again.\n\nThe user says they have shown that scalar multiplication and row swapping don't change the row space. Now they need to show that adding/subtracting vectors (rows) doesn't either. So the assumptions here would be the definitions of elementary row operations and perhaps that the row space is the span of its rows. But maybe each assumption should list the properties or conditions applied to one object. Let me think.\n\nThe user's example listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for this problem:\n\nAssumptions could be:\n- The row space of a matrix is the span of its row vectors.\n- Elementary row operations include scalar multiplication of a row, swapping two rows, and adding a multiple of one row to another.\n- Scalar multiplication and row swapping do not change the row space (as already shown).\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the third operation. The user is asking to show that adding/subtracting vectors (i.e., row addition) does not change the row space. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- Let M be a matrix with row vectors in some vector space.\n- Row space of M is the span of its rows.\n- Adding a multiple of one row to another row is an elementary row operation.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to list the conditions necessary to frame the problem. The user is working within the context of linear algebra, assuming standard definitions. But in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is more about operations on a matrix. However, the user's example includes assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\", which is a condition on the variable. So maybe here, the assumptions would be about the matrix and the operations. Wait, maybe not. Since the question is about proving a general property, perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the problem's setup. Let me check the user's example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumptions include \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But wait, the original problem's answer might require that n is divisible by 7? Or maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps that example was a mistake? Maybe the user intended that the problem had a hidden condition, but I need to follow their structure.\n\nWait, the example given by the user might not be accurate. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem in example:\nProve that for every integer n, A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is incorrect. That seems like an error. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Therefore, I should be cautious here. Maybe in their example, they intended to have a problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was different. Alternatively, maybe they wanted to structure a problem where the assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under that assumption. But 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the user split the problem into conditions? Not sure. But perhaps the example is not perfect.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The problem is to show that adding/subtracting rows (i.e., row addition) doesn't change the row space. The user has already handled scalar multiplication and swapping. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- Let M be a matrix.\n- The row space of M is the span of its row vectors.\n- Elementary row operations include row addition (adding a multiple of one row to another).\n- Scalar multiplication and row swapping operations do not change the row space (already shown).\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions are more about the operations and their properties. Wait, the problem is to prove that the row addition operation does not change the row space, given that scalar multiplication and swapping don't. So the problem's assumptions would include that scalar multiplication and swapping don't affect the row space, and the problem is to prove that row addition also doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that row operations are being considered, and the row space is defined as the span of the rows.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. So for the problem at hand:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Each row of the matrix is a vector in a vector space.\n- The row space of a matrix is the set of all linear combinations of its rows.\n- Scalar multiplication of a row does not change the row space.\n- Swapping two rows does not change the row space.\n- Adding a multiple of one row to another row is an elementary row operation.\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions here are the definitions needed. However, since the user is asking to prove that adding rows doesn't change the row space, the problem is to show that the row space remains the same after such an operation, given the existing definitions. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Let A be a matrix with rows r1, r2, ..., rn.\n- The row space of A is the span of {r1, r2, ..., rn}.\n- An elementary row operation of adding k times row i to row j is performed on A, resulting in matrix A'.\n\nProblem: Prove that the row space of A' is equal to the row space of A.\n\nBut how to structure this according to the example's format? The example's assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is more about operations on a matrix. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions and prior results:\n\nAssumption:\nThe row space of a matrix is the span of its rows.\nScalar multiplication of a row does not change the row space.\nRow swapping does not change the row space.\nElementary row operations include adding a multiple of one row to another.\n\nProblem: Prove that adding a multiple of one row to another does not change the row space of the matrix.\n\nBut the user's example listed each assumption line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe row space is the span of the row vectors.\nScalar multiplication of a row does not change the row space.\nSwapping two rows does not change the row space.\nAdding a multiple of one row to another is an elementary row operation.\n\nProblem: Prove that adding a multiple of one row to another does not change the row space.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more precise. The user's original question says: \"how would one show that adding/subtracting vectors does not change the row space?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that after adding one row to another (or subtracting), the row space remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the basic setup:\n\n- A is a matrix with rows in a vector space.\n- The row space of A is the span of its rows.\n- Adding a multiple of one row to another row is an elementary row operation.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are the properties of the row space and the operations. But following the example's structure, each assumption is a single condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nEach row of the matrix is a vector in a vector space.\nThe row space is the set of all linear combinations of the rows.\nScalar multiplication of a row does not alter the row space.\nRow swapping does not alter the row space.\nAdding a scalar multiple of one row to another is an elementary row operation.\n\nProblem: Prove that adding a scalar multiple of one row to another does not change the row space.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that the row space is preserved under row addition, given the previous results. So the assumptions might be that the other two operations are already known to preserve the row space, and now we need to show the third. However, in the example, the problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That might have been a mistake. But in any case, for the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nLet M be a matrix with row vectors.\nThe row space of M is the span of its row vectors.\nScalar multiplication of a row and row swapping do not change the row space.\n\nProblem: Prove that adding a multiple of one row to another row does not change the row space of M.\n\nYes, this seems to fit the example's format. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition. The first line states that M is a matrix with row vectors. The second defines row space. The third states that two operations don't change the row space. The problem is to prove the third operation doesn't either.\n\nSo I think this is the correct structure.",
