    "Content": "Consider the following map, which is a Cremona transformation: \n$$\n\\begin{split}\nf\\colon & \\mathbb P^2 \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb P^2 \\\\\n& (x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy: xz: yz)\n\\end{split}\n$$ I have to prove the following: 1.

Well, point (1) is clear ($xy=xz=yz=0$ implies that two of $x,y,z$ are 0). What about point 2 ? I do not know how to answer. How could I extend this map to the three special points found in point 1 ? Why is this impossible? Finally, the inverse. Is there an easy trick to find it? I've tried to solve the system in homogeneous coordinates but I think that maybe there is a faster way...

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Maybe it's time for a (reasonably complete) answer. Consider the open subvariety $U_{YZ}:=\\Bbb{P}^2 \\setminus V(YZ)$ (i.e. $\\Bbb{P}^2$ with both the $Y$-axis and the $Z$-axis removed). The rational map $f: \\Bbb{P}^2 \\dashrightarrow \\Bbb{P}^2$ can be represented on $U_{YZ}$ by the morphism \\begin{split}\nU_{YZ} &\\rightarrow U_Z:=\\Bbb{P}^2 \\setminus V(Z)\\\\\n(x:y:z) &\\mapsto (x/z:x/y:1)\n\\end{split}\nwhich shows that $f$ is defined on all of $U_{YZ}$. Similarly, you find that $f$ is defined on all of $\\Bbb{P}^2 \\setminus \\{(1:0:0),(0:1:0),(0:0:1)\\}$, and the only thing left to check for 1. and 2. is that $f$ cannot be extended to all of $\\Bbb{P}^2$. One possible explanation is the following. Consider the morphism\n\\begin{split}\nf_{cone}: \\Bbb{A}^3 &\\rightarrow \\Bbb{A}^3\\\\\n(x,y,z) &\\mapsto (xy,xz,yz)\n\\end{split}\nwhich maps every point of the form $(\\lambda,0,0),(0,\\mu,0)$ or $(0,0,\\nu)$ to the point $(0,0,0)$.\nLike every morphism of varieties, $f_{cone}$ is already uniquely determined by its restriction to any non-empty open subset, e.g. by its restriction to $\\Bbb{A}^3 \\setminus \\{(\\lambda,0,0),(0,\\mu,0),(0,0,\\nu) \\; \\vert \\; \\lambda,\\mu,\\nu \\in k\\} \\subset \\Bbb{A}^3$. But $f_{cone}$ restricted to $\\Bbb{A}^3 \\setminus \\{(\\lambda,0,0),(0,\\mu,0),(0,0,\\nu) \\; \\vert \\; \\lambda,\\mu,\\nu \\in k\\}$ induces the morphism representing the rational map $f$, as described above. Hence every extension of $f$ to a morphism defined on all of $\\Bbb{P}^2$ would have to map the points $(1:0:0),(0:1:0)$ and $(0:0:1)$ to \"$(0:0:0)$\", which is impossible, and consequently, the points $(1:0:0),(0:1:0),(0:0:1)$ cannot be in the domain of $f$. For 3. , you simply use the \"trick\" mentioned by Asal. Let $U_{XYZ}:=\\Bbb{P}^2 \\setminus V(XYZ)$ (i.e. $\\Bbb{P}^2$ without the coordinate axes). On $U_{XYZ}$, we can represent $f$ as\n$$\n(x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy:xz:yz)=1/(xyz)(xy:xz:yz)=(1/z:1/y:1/x)\n$$\nand from this, you can read off the inverse of $f_{\\vert U_{XYZ}}$ directly.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question about the Cremona transformation. Let's read through the original question again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe user provided a Cremona transformation f: ℙ² ⇢ ℙ² defined by (x:y:z) ↦ (xy : xz : yz). They have three parts to prove:\n\n1. The domain is ℙ² minus the three points (1:0:0), (0:1:0), (0:0:1).\n2. The map cannot be extended to all of ℙ².\n3. The map is birational by finding its inverse.\n\nThey mention that part 1 is clear because if xy, xz, yz are all zero, then two of x, y, z must be zero, leading to those three points. For part 2, they're unsure how to show the map can't be extended to those points. For part 3, they tried solving the system but are looking for a faster way.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this into the required format. The Assumption section should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The Problem section should state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though in the original problem statement, the user might not have explicitly stated that n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no—the example might have been adjusted. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that might be incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user is providing their own example. So maybe the user is instructing that the assumptions should list all the conditions applied to one object each.\n\nBut in the problem given here about Cremona transformations, the assumptions would be the properties of the map f, but the problem as stated by the user is to prove three specific points. Let's see.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state assumptions; it's asking to prove three things. So in this case, the Assumption section might list the properties given in the problem. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the example is wrong? Because if n is every integer, then assuming n is divisible by 7 is an additional condition. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the user intended to have the problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem might have included that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the example is illustrative, and the user wants to extract all the conditions from the problem statement, even if they are implicit.\n\nBut in the current problem about Cremona transformations, the problem is given as three parts. The user is asking to structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. The Assumptions would include the definitions given. Let me parse the original question again:\n\nThe map f is defined as a Cremona transformation from ℙ² to ℙ², given by (x:y:z) ↦ (xy : xz : yz). The user has to prove three things:\n\n1. Domain is ℙ² minus three points.\n2. The map can't be extended to all ℙ².\n3. The map is birational by finding its inverse.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- f is a Cremona transformation.\n- f is defined as (x:y:z) ↦ (xy : xz : yz).\n- The domain of f is ℙ² minus three points (as per part 1).\n- The codomain is ℙ².\n\nWait, but part 1 is what needs to be proven, so maybe the assumption is that f is defined as such, and then the problem is to determine its domain, etc. So the Assumptions would be the given conditions of the problem, not including the things to be proven.\n\nSo the original problem says \"Consider the following map, which is a Cremona transformation: [definition]. I have to prove the following: 1. ... 2. ... 3. ...\".\n\nThus, the Assumptions would be:\n\n- f: ℙ² ⇢ ℙ² is a Cremona transformation defined by (x:y:z) ↦ (xy : xz : yz).\n\nBecause the problem states that f is a Cremona transformation, so that's an assumption. The definition of f is given, so that's another part. But maybe split into two assumptions: the map is a Cremona transformation, and the map is defined by that formula. Alternatively, since the problem is structured to ask to prove certain properties about this map, the assumptions would be the given properties, which include that the map is defined as such.\n\nSo, in the example given by the user, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", but in their original problem, the user might have had a different problem where the assumption was that n is an integer. But perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but regardless, the task is to extract all the assumptions from the problem statement, each as a single line.\n\nSo for the Cremona problem:\n\nAssumptions would include:\n\n- f is a Cremona transformation (as stated in the problem).\n- f is defined by (x:y:z) ↦ (xy : xz : yz).\n- The domain of f is a subset of ℙ².\n- The problem asks to prove three things about f: its domain, non-extendability, and birationality with inverse.\n\nBut perhaps the only assumptions needed are the definition of the map and that it's a Cremona transformation. But the problem is to prove three things, so the problem statement is to prove those three points given the map's definition.\n\nTherefore, the Assumptions should list the given conditions that are not part of what needs to be proven. Since the problem says \"Consider the following map, which is a Cremona transformation\", then the assumption is that f is a Cremona transformation as defined. However, in reality, Cremona transformations are birational maps of projective spaces, so perhaps stating that f is a Cremona transformation is part of what needs to be proven in part 3 (birational). But the user's problem says \"prove the following: 1. ... 3. the map is birational...\", so the fact that it's a Cremona transformation might be given as part of the problem statement, which would be an assumption here.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is structured as: given this map (which happens to be a Cremona transformation), prove these three things. So the Assumption would be that the map is defined as (x:y:z) ↦ (xy:xz:yz), and that it's a Cremona transformation. But maybe the fact that it's a Cremona transformation is part of the problem's assertion, not an assumption. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to take the given map and prove three properties, one of which is that it's birational (hence a Cremona transformation). So perhaps the only assumption is the definition of the map. The problem's first part is to determine the domain, the second to show non-extendability, and third to show it's birational by finding the inverse.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list:\n\n- The map f: ℙ² ⇢ ℙ² is defined by (x:y:z) ↦ (xy : xz : yz).\n\nBecause that's the given data. The fact that it's a Cremona transformation is part of the problem's introduction, but the actual task is to prove it's birational (which is what a Cremona transformation is). So perhaps the problem is to prove that this map is a Cremona transformation by showing it's birational, along with the other parts.\n\nThus, the Assumptions would be the definition of the map f. The problem then is to prove the three points: domain, non-extendability, and birationality with inverse.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℙ² ⇢ ℙ² is defined by (x:y:z) ↦ (xy : xz : yz).\n\nProblem:\n1. Prove that the domain of f is ℙ² ∖ {(1:0:0), (0:1:0), (0:0:1)}.\n2. Prove that f cannot be extended to all of ℙ².\n3. Prove that f is birational by finding its inverse.\n\nBut the original problem statement includes all three parts as things to prove, so the problem part should encapsulate all three. However, the user's example had the problem as a single statement. So perhaps in the user's desired format, the problem is stated as a single problem encompassing all three parts. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem was to list assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in reality, the original problem was for every integer n, so perhaps the example had a mistake. But regardless, the task is to follow the user's example.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question has three parts. So perhaps the Problem section should list all three parts as the problem to solve. However, the example given by the user had the problem as a single statement. So maybe in the user's format, the problem is written as a single problem, even if it has multiple parts. Let me see:\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, which was the main problem. The original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which might have been a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the example was from a different problem where n had to be divisible by 7. But perhaps the user's intention is that the Assumption section lists all the conditions given in the problem, and the Problem section states what needs to be proven.\n\nIn the current problem, the given conditions are the definition of the map f. The three parts are what needs to be proven. So the Assumption is the definition of f, and the Problem is to prove the three parts.\n\nBut the user's example lists assumptions and then the problem. So the Assumption here is the map's definition, and the Problem is the three parts. But the user's example had the problem as a single statement. However, in the current problem, the original question has three separate parts to prove. So perhaps the Problem section should list all three as bullet points or as a single problem statement with three parts.\n\nThe user's example had the problem as a single line: \"Prove that $$A(n) = ...$$ is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps the current problem should be written similarly, combining the three parts into one problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Problem section should include all three parts as numbered items. The user's example didn't have multiple parts, but the current problem does. The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, so perhaps we need to write the problem as a single statement, but including all three parts.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's example combined the original problem (which had \"for every integer n\") into the problem statement, perhaps in this case, the three parts should be included in the problem statement as a list.\n\nBut the user's format requires that the problem is written within \\< and \\>, so it's a single line. Wait, no, in the example, the problem was written as:\n\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nSo the problem is a single statement. In the current case, the original problem has three parts. So perhaps the problem should be written as three separate statements in the Problem section, but according to the format, it's one problem. Alternatively, the user may accept listing the three parts in the problem section.\n\nBut the example shows that the problem is a single statement, so perhaps we need to combine the three parts into a single problem statement. For example:\n\nProblem: Prove the following for the map $f$: 1. The domain is $\\mathbb P^2 \\setminus \\{(1:0:0), (0:1:0), (0:0:1)\\}$. 2. The map cannot be extended to all $\\mathbb P^2$. 3. The map is birational by finding its inverse.\n\nBut the user's example used LaTeX formatting within the problem statement. So perhaps we can structure it similarly, with each part listed in the problem.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f\\colon \\mathbb P^2 \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb P^2$ is defined by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy: xz: yz)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve the following for the map $f$:\n1. The domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb P^2 \\setminus \\{(1:0:0), (0:1:0), (0:0:1)\\}$.\n2. The map $f$ cannot be extended to all of $\\mathbb P^2$.\n3. The map $f$ is birational by finding its inverse.\n\nBut according to the example, the Assumption section lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So here, the assumption is the definition of the map f. However, if there are multiple assumptions, they should be listed line by line.\n\nIn this case, the map is defined with certain properties. Perhaps breaking down the definition into parts:\n\n- $f$ is a map from $\\mathbb P^2$ to $\\mathbb P^2$.\n- $f$ is defined by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy: xz: yz)$.\n\nSo two assumptions here. But the original problem also mentions that $f$ is a Cremona transformation. Should that be an assumption? The problem says \"Consider the following map, which is a Cremona transformation\". So that's given, hence an assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is a Cremona transformation,\n$f\\colon \\mathbb P^2 \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb P^2$,\n$f$ is defined by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy: xz: yz)$.\n\nBut Cremona transformations are birational maps of projective spaces, so part 3 of the problem is to prove that it's birational, which would imply it's a Cremona transformation. But the problem statement says that $f$ is a Cremona transformation, so perhaps that's given, hence an assumption. However, the user might have intended that the fact that it's a Cremona transformation is part of what needs to be proven (part 3). Therefore, there's a confusion here.\n\nWait, the original problem states: \"Consider the following map, which is a Cremona transformation: [definition]. I have to prove the following: 1. ... 3. The map is birational by finding its inverse.\"\n\nSo the problem introduces $f$ as a Cremona transformation, and then asks to prove it's birational. But Cremona transformations are birational maps of projective space, so perhaps the problem is redundant, or maybe the user is using \"Cremona transformation\" as a given term, and part 3 is to show it's birational (which is a property of Cremona transformations). Therefore, the fact that it's a Cremona transformation is given, but part 3 is to prove it's birational, which is part of the definition.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, but perhaps the problem is structured such that the user is to take the given map (which is a Cremona transformation) and prove three things about it, including that it's birational. So the assumption is that it's a Cremona transformation, and the problem includes proving it's birational. That seems contradictory, but perhaps the problem is using \"Cremona transformation\" as a type of map, and the task is to verify that this map fits the definition by proving birationality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is slightly off, and the map is a Cremona transformation, which by definition is birational, but the user is to find the inverse to confirm it. In any case, following the problem as presented, the user is to prove three things: domain, non-extendability, and birationality with inverse.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should include:\n\n- The map $f$ is a Cremona transformation.\n- $f$ is defined by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy: xz: yz)$.\n- $f$ maps from $\\mathbb P^2$ to $\\mathbb P^2$ (as a dashed arrow, indicating it's a rational map).\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the domain, etc., the assumptions are the given properties, which are the definition of the map and that it's a Cremona transformation. However, since Cremona transformations are birational, and part 3 is to prove it's birational, perhaps the assumption should not include that it's a Cremona transformation, but only the definition of the map. Because if the problem is to prove that it's a Cremona transformation (which requires proving it's birational), then the assumption is just the definition of the map.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be introducing the map as an example of a Cremona transformation, and the task is to verify the properties that make it a Cremona transformation. Therefore, the assumption is the definition of the map, and the problem is to prove the three points, which collectively establish it as a Cremona transformation.\n\nGiven this, the correct Assumptions would be the definition of the map, and the Problem is the three parts. The mention of Cremona transformation in the problem statement is just context, not an assumption, because the task is to prove it's birational (hence a Cremona transformation).\n\nTherefore, the Assumption is:\n\n- The map $f\\colon \\mathbb P^2 \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb P^2$ is defined by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy: xz: yz)$.\n\nAnd the Problem is to prove the three parts. However, the user's example had assumptions listed line by line. Here, the map's definition is one assumption. But perhaps we need to break it down further:\n\n- $f$ is a rational map from $\\mathbb P^2$ to $\\mathbb P^2$.\n- $f$ is defined by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy: xz: yz)$.\n\nBut maybe that's splitting hairs. The important thing is to capture all given assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f\\colon \\mathbb P^2 \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb P^2$ is defined by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy: xz: yz)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. The domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb P^2 \\setminus \\{(1:0:0), (0:1:0), (0:0:1)\\}$.\n2. $f$ cannot be extended to all of $\\mathbb P^2$.\n3. $f$ is birational by finding its inverse.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is stated as a single statement. However, here we have three separate statements to prove. The user's example didn't have multiple parts, but the current problem does. Therefore, to adhere to the format, perhaps the Problem section should list all three as separate points within a single problem statement.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove a single divisibility. Here, the problem is to prove three things. So perhaps the Problem section will include all three parts as numbered items within the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f\\colon \\mathbb P^2 \\dashrightarrow \\mathbb P^2$ is defined by $(x:y:z) \\mapsto (xy: xz: yz)$.\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1.
