    "AcceptedAnswer": "Okay, I don't know if you will be satisfied with this. But here is one way: Let $I$ be a fractional ideal. Then by finiteness of ideal class group, there exists $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $I^m = (\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha  \\in K^*$. Let $L = K(a^{1/m})$. I claim that $I\\mathcal{O}_L$ is principal. In fact, I claim that $I\\mathcal{O}_L = (\\alpha^{1/m})$. Well, $(I\\mathcal{O}_L)^m = I^m\\mathcal{O}_L = (\\alpha)\\mathcal{O}_L = (\\alpha)$. Clearly, $(\\alpha^{1/m})^m = (\\alpha)$. Now it is easy to see that if $I, J$ are fractional ideals such that $I^m = J^m$, then $I = J$. Thus, $I\\mathcal{O}_L = (\\alpha^{1/m})$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the question is about proving that every ideal of the ring of integers in an algebraic number field becomes principal in some finite extension field, without using class field theory. The original statement mentions the Hilbert class field, which I know is related to making ideals principal, but the user wants a proof without invoking class field theory.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the assumptions. The problem states that K is an algebraic number field, which means it's a finite extension of the rationals. Then, I is a non-zero ideal of the ring of integers O_K. The goal is to show there exists a finite extension L of K such that the extension of I to L (i.e., I*O_L) is principal. \n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n1. K is an algebraic number field.\n2. I is a non-zero ideal of O_K.\n3. L is a finite extension of K.\n4. The problem is to prove that I*O_L is principal.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they listed each assumption line by line. Let me make sure I parse the original question correctly. The user wrote: \"Let K be an algebraic number field. Let I be a non-zero ideal of the ring of integers O_K in K. [...] there exists a finite extension [...] L of K such that I O_L is principal. Can we prove this without using class field theory?\"\n\nSo breaking down the assumptions:\n- K is an algebraic number field.\n- I is a non-zero ideal of O_K.\n- L is a finite extension of K.\n- The problem is to prove that I*O_L is a principal ideal.\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't state that L is given; rather, we need to show the existence of such an L. So perhaps the assumptions are just K being an algebraic number field and I being a non-zero ideal of O_K. The existence of L is part of what we need to prove. So maybe the problem is to show that for K and I as given, there exists a finite extension L/K such that I*O_L is principal.\n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- K is an algebraic number field.\n- I is a non-zero ideal of the ring of integers O_K.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a finite extension field L of K such that I O_L is principal.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original example might have had a typo or perhaps the user made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would include all integers, not just those divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made an error in the example. Hmm. That might be a problem. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, then the problem is changed. So maybe that example was incorrect, but perhaps the user intended that. However, in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided.\n\nSo the original question is: \"Let K be an algebraic number field. Let I be a non-zero ideal of the ring of integers O_K in K. By class field theory, there exists a finite extension(the Hilbert class field) L of K such that I O_L is principal. Can we prove this without using class field theory?\"\n\nSo the problem is: Given K (an algebraic number field) and I (a non-zero ideal of O_K), prove that there exists a finite extension L of K such that I O_L is principal, without using class field theory.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- K is an algebraic number field.\n- I is a non-zero ideal of O_K.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a finite extension L of K such that I O_L is principal.\n\nBut the user's example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. But in this case, the problem doesn't have additional hidden assumptions; the question is as stated. So perhaps the example was a mistake. Anyway, following the current problem's structure.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nK is an algebraic number field,\nI is a non-zero ideal of the ring of integers O_K in K.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a finite extension L of K such that I O_L is principal.\n\nThat's the correct breakdown. Each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object. The first line states K's property, the second line states I's property. The problem is to show the existence of L.",
