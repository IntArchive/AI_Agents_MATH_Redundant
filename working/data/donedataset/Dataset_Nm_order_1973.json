    "Content": "Ok, so I got an answer wrong on my exam because my teacher says that the function $f(x)=\\frac{(x+2)x}{x+2}=x$ but I insist that it isn't defined for x=-2. If it was then $\\frac{x}{x}=1$ for all reals and so $\\frac{0}{0}=1$. However this doesn't seem to do the trick with my teacher. How can I use the latter fact to prove something outrageous and convince her?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$$\\begin{align}\\frac00&=\\frac{2\\times0}{1\\times0}=\\frac21=2\\\\\\\\\\\\=\\frac00&=\\frac{3\\times0}{1\\times0}=\\frac31=3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\implies2&=3\\end{align}$$ NOPE.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is having an argument with their math teacher about whether the function f(x) = [(x+2)x]/(x+2) is equal to x and defined for all real numbers, including x = -2. The student says it's not defined at x = -2, but the teacher says it is. The student wants to use a contradiction by applying the teacher's logic to another case, like 0/0 = 1, to show an absurd result.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question correctly. The function given is f(x) = [x(x+2)]/(x+2). The student simplified this to f(x) = x but argues that it's undefined at x = -2 because the original expression has a denominator that becomes zero there. The teacher, however, claims it's equal to x everywhere, including x = -2. \n\nSo, the key points here are about the domain of a function and when simplification is valid. When you simplify a rational function by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator, the domain is still restricted by the original denominator. In this case, even though (x+2) cancels out, the function f(x) is still undefined at x = -2 because the original expression had a denominator of x+2. The simplified version f(x) = x is only valid when x ≠ -2. \n\nThe student's analogy is that if we say f(x) = x everywhere, including x = -2, then by similar logic, we could say that x/x = 1 for all x, including x = 0, which would imply 0/0 = 1. But 0/0 is undefined, so this leads to a contradiction. The student wants to use this reasoning to convince the teacher that their original function isn't defined at x = -2.\n\nTo structure this properly, the assumptions need to be listed one by one. The main assumption here is that the function f(x) is equal to x for all real numbers, including x = -2. Another assumption is the method of simplifying rational functions by canceling common factors without considering the domain restrictions. The problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, such as 0/0 = 1, which is undefined.\n\nWait, but in the example provided earlier, the assumptions were about the properties of n. Here, the assumptions would be about the function's definition and the teacher's reasoning. Let me make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, for the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: f(x) is defined as [(x+2)x]/(x+2).\nAssumption: f(x) is simplified to x by canceling (x+2) in numerator and denominator.\nAssumption: The simplified function f(x) = x is considered valid for all real numbers, including x = -2.\n\nProblem: Show that accepting the simplified form f(x) = x for all real numbers leads to the conclusion that 0/0 = 1, which is a contradiction.\n\nBut the user wants to structure the problem using the given format, filtering unrelated info. The original problem on Math Stack Exchange is about convincing the teacher by using the latter fact (0/0=1) to prove something outrageous.\n\nSo, the key assumptions are the teacher's approach to simplifying the function and extending the domain to include x=-2. The problem is to demonstrate that this approach leads to an invalid conclusion (like 0/0=1), thereby showing the inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list each assumption related to the function's definition and the teacher's reasoning, then state the problem as proving the contradiction.",
