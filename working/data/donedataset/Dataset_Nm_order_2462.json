    "Content": "Dummit and Foote, 7.4.33(a) : Let $R$ be the ring of all continuous functions $[0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and let $M_c$ be the kernel of evaluation at $c \\in [0,1]$, i.e. all $f$ such that $f(c) = 0$. Show that if $M$ is a maximal ideal in $R$ then $M = M_c$ for some $c$. I am aware of proofs that use the compactness of $[0,1]$; however I have been told that a simpler proof exists using only the isomorphism theorems for rings along with basic facts about ideals. I have tried on my own to prove it this way but still have no success; is it possible? (My attempts go something like: since $M$ is maximal, the quotient ring $R/M$ is a field. Then it would be nice to use the fact that $R/M$ has no zero divisors, but I can't quite make it work. Alternatively, consider $M \\cap M_c$.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Whoever told you that was mistaken; there is no way to prove this without using some special property of $[0,1]$ that is closely related to compactness.  To try to convince you of this, let me point out that the result is not true if you replace $[0,1]$ by $(0,1]$ .  Indeed, if $R$ is the ring of continuous functions $(0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ , let $I\\subset R$ be the set of functions which are identically $0$ on $(0,\\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon>0$ .  Then $I$ is an ideal: if $f,g\\in I$ with $f$ vanishing on $(0,\\epsilon)$ and $g$ vanishing on $(0,\\epsilon')$ , then $f+g$ vanishes on $(0,\\min(\\epsilon, \\epsilon'))$ .  And if $f\\in I$ and $g\\in R$ , then $gf$ vanishes everywhere that $f$ does, so $gf\\in I$ . Since the constant function $1$ is not in $I$ , $I$ is a proper ideal in $R$ , so there is some maximal ideal $M$ containing it.  But for any $c\\in (0,1]$ , $M\\neq M_c$ , since we can take $\\epsilon=c/2$ and find a continuous function $f$ which vanishes on $(0,\\epsilon)$ but such that $f(c)\\neq 0$ , and then $f\\in M$ but $f\\not\\in M_c$ . More generally, a similar counterexample can be given for any reasonably nice non-compact space.  To be precise, let $X$ be any completely regular space that is not compact and let $R$ be the ring of continuous functions $X\\to\\mathbb{R}$ .  Then there exists a maximal ideal in $R$ which is not $M_c=\\{f\\in R:f(c)=0\\}$ for any $c\\in X$ .  (Proof sketch: pick a point $x\\in \\beta X\\setminus X$ , let $I$ be the ideal of functions which vanish in a neighborhood of $x$ , and let $M$ be any maximal ideal containing $I$ .)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided involved breaking down the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. Let me apply that to the Math Stack Exchange question about maximal ideals in the ring of continuous functions.\n\nFirst, the original problem is to show that every maximal ideal M in the ring R (which consists of all continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ) is of the form M_c, the kernel of evaluation at some point c in [0,1]. The user mentioned that the standard proofs use compactness of [0,1], but they want a simpler proof using ring isomorphism theorems and basic ideal facts.\n\nSo, I need to extract the assumptions. Let's parse the problem step by step. The ring R is defined as all continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ. The ideals M_c are kernels of evaluation maps at points c. The goal is to show that any maximal ideal M is equal to some M_c.\n\nAssumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's list the objects involved: R, M, M_c. \n\n1. R is the ring of all continuous functions [0,1] → ℝ. \n2. M_c is the kernel of evaluation at c ∈ [0,1], i.e., M_c = {f ∈ R | f(c) = 0}.\n3. M is a maximal ideal in R.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem statement is then to show that M = M_c for some c ∈ [0,1].\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the assumptions were listed as two separate points. So here, the key assumptions are:\n\n- R is the ring of continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ.\n- M_c is the kernel of evaluation at c in [0,1].\n- M is a maximal ideal in R.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement as given, the user is asking to show that if M is a maximal ideal, then M = M_c. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- R is the ring of all continuous functions [0,1] → ℝ.\n- M is a maximal ideal in R.\n- M_c is the kernel of evaluation at c ∈ [0,1].\n\nBut the problem is to show that M must be equal to some M_c. So maybe the assumptions are just R being the ring of continuous functions, M being a maximal ideal, and M_c being defined as the kernel of evaluation. But the problem is to show that M is one of those M_c. So the problem statement is: Show that if M is a maximal ideal in R, then M = M_c for some c ∈ [0,1].\n\nBut how to structure the assumptions? Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user probably had a typo, because the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe the user made a mistake, but perhaps the example is correct. Wait, no—the original problem might have been different. Wait, the example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe there was a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user mistyped. Or maybe the example is wrong. Hmm. Wait, maybe the example is correct. Let me check again: Original problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But the user provided that as an example of their desired format, so maybe they intended that even if the original problem didn't state the divisibility by 7, but maybe in their example, they added that assumption. Hmm. So perhaps the example is not correctly formatted. But regardless, the user wants me to follow that format. So in their example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. R is the ring of all continuous functions [0,1] → ℝ.\n2. M is a maximal ideal in R.\n3. M_c is the kernel of evaluation at c ∈ [0,1].\n\nBut the problem statement is to show that M = M_c for some c. So the problem is as stated. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nR is the ring of all continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ,\nM is a maximal ideal in R,\nM_c is the kernel of evaluation at c ∈ [0,1].\nProblem:\nShow that M = M_c for some c ∈ [0,1].\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated in the original question is \"Show that if M is a maximal ideal in R then M = M_c for some c.\" So the key assumption is that M is a maximal ideal in R. The other parts (definition of R and M_c) are part of the problem setup, not assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\n- R is the ring of all continuous functions [0,1] → ℝ.\n- M is a maximal ideal in R.\n- M_c is the kernel of evaluation at c ∈ [0,1].\n\nBut in the example, the user included assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect. However, following the user's example, maybe they want to list all the given conditions as separate assumptions. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R is the ring of all continuous functions [0,1] → ℝ.\n- M is a maximal ideal in R.\n- For each c ∈ [0,1], M_c is the kernel of evaluation at c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that M = M_c for some c ∈ [0,1].\n\nAlternatively, the original problem might have M as a maximal ideal, and the goal is to show M is some M_c. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is the ring of continuous functions from [0,1] to ℝ.\n- M is a maximal ideal in R.\n- For each c ∈ [0,1], M_c is the ideal of functions vanishing at c.\n\nProblem:\nShow that M must be equal to M_c for some c ∈ [0,1].\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property of one object. So the three assumptions are about R, M, and M_c. Then the problem is to show M = M_c. That should fit the format.",
