    "Content": "The sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the positive fixed points of the tangent function is $1/10$. I've seen this proved by means of residues, but I don't remember the details. I've also heard it asserted that it that it can be done by means of Green's functions. What proofs of this fact are published or otherwise known? PS: Maybe it is of interest to note that the positive fixed points of the tangent function are also the abscissas of the extreme values of the function $x\\mapsto\\dfrac{\\sin x} x.$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For the sake of at least having an answer, here's what's in J.M.'s link, in a nutshell anyway. Note that $\\tan(x)-x$ and $\\sin(x)-x\\cos(x)$ have the same zeros but the latter is holomorphic on the complex plane - the difference is that the latter has a triple root at $0$ whereas the former only has a double root, but our sum doesn't involve $x=0$ anyway. This means it affords a Weierstrass factorization . Some work can show that the coefficients of the expanded-out polynomials of the partial products in such a factorization will, in the limit, converge to those of the Taylor expansion of the function so long as we ignore the $e^{g(z)}$ and $E_n(z)$ factors. We can also show that the zeros are approximately $x_n\\approx(n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$ asymptotically, and comparing this with the factorization for, say, $\\sin$ tells us we don't need any $E_n$ factors. Now putting together the series expansions for sine and cosine gives $$\\left(x-\\frac{1}{3!}x^3+\\frac{1}{5!}x^5-\\cdots\\right)-x\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2!}x^2+\\frac{1}{4!}x^4-\\cdots\\right)$$ $$=\\frac{1}{3}x^3\\left(1-\\frac{1}{10}x^2+\\cdots\\right).$$ We ignore the $x^3$ and normalize so that $a_0=1,a_1=0,a_2=-1/10$. Now compute $$\\sum_{\\tan(u)=u\\ne0}u^{-2}=\\left(\\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_i}\\right)^2-2\\left(\\sum_{i<j}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_i\\lambda_j}\\right)$$ $$=a_1^2-2a_2=\\frac{1}{5}.$$ Note that $\\tan(x)-x$ is an odd function and squaring takes out signs so by symmetry the above sum essentially double-counts every positive root. Divide by $2$ and our final answer is $1/10$. Note that all sums-of-reciprocals of even powers of solutions to $\\tan(x)=x$ can be evaluated in this way by using the Newton-Girard formulas .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about the sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the positive fixed points of the tangent function being 1/10. The user wants this structured into Assumptions and Problem sections, with each assumption addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem mentions \"positive fixed points of the tangent function.\" So the fixed points are solutions to tan(x) = x. But since we're focusing on positive fixed points, the assumption here is that we're considering the positive solutions. Also, the sum is specifically about the squares of the reciprocals of these fixed points. The problem states that this sum equals 1/10. However, the original problem doesn't mention any additional conditions on the fixed points beyond being positive and satisfying tan(x) = x. So maybe there's only one main assumption here. Wait, but the problem is to prove the sum equals 1/10, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which this holds. But the user's example didn't add assumptions from the problem statement unless they were given. In the original example, the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7 was part of the problem's given conditions. Here, the problem doesn't state any additional conditions beyond the fixed points being positive. So perhaps the only assumption is that the fixed points are the positive solutions to tan(x) = x. But maybe I need to break it down more. Let me check again.\n\nAssumptions should list each condition. The problem is about the sum of the squares of reciprocals of the positive fixed points. So:\n\n1. The fixed points are solutions to tan(x) = x.\n2. We consider only positive fixed points.\n3. The sum is taken over these positive fixed points.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each is a separate line. So each line addresses one property of one object. Here, the fixed points are defined by tan(x) = x, and they are positive. So maybe two assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe fixed points are solutions to the equation tan(x) = x,\nThe fixed points are positive.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the positive fixed points is 1/10.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the original question already specifies \"the positive fixed points of the tangent function\", so maybe the assumption is just that the fixed points are the positive solutions of tan(x) = x. But perhaps to split it into two: first, they are fixed points (solutions to tan(x) = x), second, they are positive. But in the user's example, they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe here it's similar: the problem mentions \"positive fixed points\", so the assumptions are that the fixed points are solutions to tan(x) = x and that they are positive. Therefore, two assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to compute the sum given that these are the fixed points, maybe the only assumption is that the fixed points are the positive solutions. But the user's example included two separate assumptions even if they were both part of the problem statement. So I think splitting into two assumptions here is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe fixed points are solutions to the equation tan(x) = x,\nThe fixed points considered are positive.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the positive fixed points is 1/10.\n\nI need to check if the original problem mentions anything else that should be an assumption, but the original question just states the sum and asks for proofs. The PS mentions that these fixed points are also abscissas of extremes of sin(x)/x, but that's additional context, not part of the problem's assumptions. The user wants to filter unrelated info, so the PS can be omitted in the formatted problem. Therefore, the assumptions are as above.",
