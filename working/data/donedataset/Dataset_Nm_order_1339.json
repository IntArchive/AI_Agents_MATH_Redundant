    "Content": "How can we prove $$\\int_0^1\\frac{x^{2/3}(1-x)^{-1/3}}{1-x+x^2}\\mathrm{d} x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3\\sqrt 3}?$$ Thought 1 It cannot be solved by using contour integration directly. If we replace $-1/3$ with $-2/3$ or $1/3$ or something else, we can use contour integration directly to solve it. Thought 2 I have tried substitution $x=t^3$ and $x=1-t$ . None of them worked. But I noticed that the form of $1-x+x^2$ does not change while applying $x=1-t$ . Thought 3 Recall the integral representation of $_2F_1$ function, I was able to convert it into a formula with $_2F_1\\left(2/3,1;4/3; e^{\\pi i/3}\\right)$ involved. But I think it will only make the integral more \"complex\". Moreover, I prefer a elementary approach. (But I also appreciate hypergeometric approach)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The solution heavily exploits symmetry of the integrand. Let $$I = \\int_0^1\\frac{x^{2/3}(1-x)^{-1/3}}{1-x+x^2} dx $$ Replace $x$ by $1-x$ and sum up gives $$\\tag{1} 2I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^{2/3}(1-x)^{-1/3} + (1-x)^{2/3}x^{-1/3}}{1-x+x^2} dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^{-1/3}(1-x)^{-1/3}}{1-x+x^2} dx$$ Let $\\ln_1$ be complex logarithm with branch cut at positive real axis, while $\\ln_2$ be the one whose cut is at negative real axis. Denote $$f(z) = \\frac{2}{3}\\ln_1(x) - \\frac{1}{3}\\ln_2 (1-x)$$ Then $f(z)$ is discontinuous along the positive axis, but have different jump in $\\arg$ across intervals $[0,1]$ and $[1,\\infty)$ . Now integrate $g(z) = e^{f(z)}/(1-z+z^2)$ using keyhole contour. Let $\\gamma_1$ be path slightly above $[0,1]$ , $\\gamma_4$ below. $\\gamma_2$ be path slightly above $[1,\\infty)$ , $\\gamma_3$ below. It is easily checked that $$\\int_{\\gamma 1} g(z) dz = I \\qquad \\qquad \\int_{\\gamma 4} g(z) dz = I e^{4\\pi i/3}$$ $$\\int_{\\gamma 2} g(z) dz = e^{\\pi i/3}  \\underbrace{\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{x^{2/3}(x-1)^{-1/3}}{1-x+x^2} dx}_J\\qquad \\int_{\\gamma 3} g(z) dz = e^{\\pi i} J$$ If we perform $x\\mapsto 1/x$ on $J$ , we get $\\int_0^1 x^{-1/3}(1-x)^{-1/3}/(1-x+x^2)dx$ , thus $J = 2I$ by $(1)$ . Therefore $$I(1-e^{4\\pi i/3}) + 2I(e^{\\pi i / 3} - e^{\\pi i}) = 2\\pi i\\times \\text{Sum of residues of } g(z) \\text{ at } e^{\\pm 2\\pi i /3}$$ From which I believe you can work out the value of $I$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example given shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about evaluating the integral ∫₀¹ [x^(2/3)(1-x)^(-1/3)] / [1 - x + x²] dx and proving it equals 2π/(3√3). \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The integrand has x^(2/3), so maybe the assumption is that x is in [0,1], but since the integral is from 0 to 1, maybe that's part of the problem statement. Wait, the example's assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumptions are about the limits of integration, the integrand's form, and any conditions needed for convergence or the substitution mentioned.\n\nThe integrand has (1-x)^{-1/3}, which is problematic at x=1. But since it's integrated from 0 to 1, we need to check if the integral converges there. However, the user might not mention convergence as an assumption, maybe they just state the integral exists. But the original problem just presents the integral as given, so perhaps the main assumption is the integral is over [0,1], and the integrand has those exponents and denominator.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove the integral equals 2π/(3√3). The assumptions would be the conditions under which this integral is evaluated. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the key elements are the limits of integration (0 to 1), the integrand's structure, and perhaps the substitution attempts mentioned in the thoughts.\n\nBut according to the format, assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So each line is an assumption about one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\nThe integral is from 0 to 1. The integrand is x^{2/3}*(1 - x)^{-1/3} divided by (1 - x + x²). The problem is to prove it equals 2π/(3√3).\n\nAssumptions needed: \n\n1. The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1]. So one assumption is \"The integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\"\n\n2. The integrand involves x raised to the 2/3 power. So \"The integrand includes x^(2/3).\"\n\n3. The integrand includes (1 - x) raised to the -1/3 power. So \"The integrand includes (1 - x)^(-1/3).\"\n\n4. The denominator of the integrand is 1 - x + x². \"The denominator of the integrand is 1 - x + x².\"\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was on the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about an integral with specific exponents and denominator. However, the user's example seems to filter the original problem's assumptions. The original problem didn't state any assumptions, but the formatted version added assumptions based on the problem's content.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example actually had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted assumption: \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\"\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds that n is divisible by 7. That suggests maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps in their process, they are extracting implicit assumptions? Hmm, maybe in the example, the correct divisibility by 91 requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\". That might be an error in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show that the assumptions are more specific than the original problem.\n\nIn any case, back to the current problem. The problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange is to evaluate that integral. The user's thoughts mention substitutions tried, like x = t³ and x = 1 - t, and that the denominator remains invariant under x = 1 - t. The denominator 1 - x + x² is symmetric in some substitution.\n\nBut for the assumptions, we need to list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption 1: The integral is over the interval [0, 1].\n\nAssumption 2: The integrand contains x^(2/3).\n\nAssumption 3: The integrand contains (1 - x)^(-1/3).\n\nAssumption 4: The denominator of the integrand is 1 - x + x².\n\nBut perhaps more precise. For example, the exponents 2/3 and -1/3, but maybe the problem assumes that the integral converges, but since it's given as a proper integral from 0 to 1, perhaps the only assumption is the interval. Wait, but near x=1, (1 - x)^{-1/3} would have an integrable singularity since the exponent is -1/3, which is greater than -1. Similarly, near x=0, x^(2/3) is integrable. So the integral converges, but maybe that's not an assumption but a given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the definitions of the integrand components. The problem is to evaluate the integral with those specific components. So each part of the integrand is an assumption. So each line in assumptions would specify a part of the integrand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the integral's structure. Wait, the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That might have been a mistake, but perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are just the components of the integrand and the interval.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{x^{2/3}(1-x)^{-1/3}}{1 - x + x^2}\\),\nEach term in the integrand is defined as \\(x^{2/3}\\), \\((1-x)^{-1/3}\\), and \\(1 - x + x^2\\).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1],\nThe numerator of the integrand is \\(x^{2/3}(1 - x)^{-1/3}\\),\nThe denominator of the integrand is \\(1 - x + x^2\\),\nThe variable \\(x\\) is real and within [0, 1].\n\nBut maybe the last one is redundant because the integral is from 0 to 1. The example didn't specify that n is an integer in the assumptions, but the original problem stated it. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\", which was given. Then added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was incorrectly formatted, but the user provided it as an example. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions should list components of the integrand and the interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to filter out unrelated information from the original question. The original question mentions thoughts about substitution, hypergeometric functions, etc., but the formatted problem should just present the core assumptions and the problem.\n\nSo, the Problem is: Prove that the integral from 0 to 1 of [x^{2/3}(1-x)^{-1/3}/(1 - x + x²)] dx equals 2π/(3√3).\n\nAssumptions would be the integral bounds and the integrand's structure. Each part as separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand's numerator is \\(x^{2/3}(1 - x)^{-1/3}\\),\nThe integrand's denominator is \\(1 - x + x^2\\).\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_0^1\\frac{x^{2/3}(1-x)^{-1/3}}{1 - x + x^2}dx = \\frac{2\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}}.$$\n\nI think that's the correct structure. Each assumption line addresses one component: interval, numerator, denominator. The problem is to prove the equality.",
