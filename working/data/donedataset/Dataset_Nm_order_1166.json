    "Content": "I was joking with my friend about disproving the Riemann Hypothesis and I randomly gave him this number:\n$$\nz_? = \\frac13 + 5466322356764788987534453212467843688257746873357895.6356798776664333i\n$$ He plugged it into Mathematica and got $\\zeta(z_?)=0.000000000445763 + 0.000000011155i$. This was remarkably close to zero for a completely random choice. To investigate, we ran a small program that calculated $\\min_{k\\in S}\\zeta(z_?+ik\\epsilon)$ where $\\epsilon=10^{-8}$ and $S$ was some \"large\" subset of $\\mathbb{Z}$ (namely $[-10^{10},\\ 10^{10}]\\cap\\mathbb{Z}$). After about 10 minutes of computations, Mathematica spit out this: $$\n\\zeta(z_!) = 0.\\times10^{-33}+0.\\times10^{-33}i \\\\\nz_! = \\frac13 + 5466322356764788987534453212467843688237746873357395.\n635356798779776664433i\n$$ Now I know $z_!$ wouldn't be an exact value for the root, but that's damn close if it is. I REFUSE to believe I randomly guessed a counterexample to RH. I simply REFUSE . How can I prove that this isn't a counterexample? Can I use the asymptotics of the zeta function? Edit: Something that made me suspicious is that the computation only took 10 minutes. I don't know what the implementation of the zeta fuction is in Mathematica, but doing 10 billion computations of the zeta function for an argument that large with high enough accuracy seems like it should take more than 10 minutes, which made me think this is purely a floating-point error, or a rounding error, or something non-analytic.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Most of computing algorithms depend on series expansions which could be represented by conditional loops statements and bit shifting operations. You can write your own program to calculate Riemann-Zeta function inside the critical strip depending on Dirichlet-Eta function.\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\eta(s)=\\left(1-2^{1-s}\\right)\\zeta(s)=-\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{n^s} \\\\[4mm]\n& s=a-i\\,b \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{n^s}=\\frac{n^{i\\,b}}{n^a}=\\frac{e^{i\\,b\\log n}}{e^{a\\log n}}=\\frac{\\cos(b\\log n)+i\\,\\sin(b\\log n)}{\\exp(a\\log n)} \\Rightarrow \\\\[4mm]\n& \\color{blue}{-\\eta(a-i\\,b)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^n\\frac{\\cos(b\\log n)}{\\exp(a\\log n)}+i\\,\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^n\\frac{\\sin(b\\log n)}{\\exp(a\\log n)}} \\\\[4mm]\n& \\text{Where}\\colon \\\\\n& \\qquad \\log n=-\\log(1/n)=-\\log\\left(1-(1-1/n)\\right)=\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(1-1/n)^m}{m}=\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(n-1)^m}{m\\,n^m} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\exp(-a\\log n)=\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^m\\frac{(a\\log n)^m}{m!} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\cos(b\\log n)=\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^m\\frac{(b\\log n)^{2m}}{(2m)!} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\sin(b\\log n)=\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^m\\frac{(b\\log n)^{2m+1}}{(2m+1)!} \\\\\n& \\quad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\color{white}{\\text{.}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\nSeparate functions could be written to calculate the functions {Log(x), Exp(x), Cos(x), Sin(x)} using conditional loops that break at a desired error tolerance. As well as, if you wish to reduce the floating point error and increase the accuracy, you could re-define the basic operations {Add($x + y$), Sub($x - y$), Mul($x \\times y$), Div($x \\div y$)} with new functions of your own, using the bit shifting operations over concatenated variables. This will give you the ability to do calculation with much more than 64 bit. By the way, unfortunately, calculating the Dirichlet-Eta real and imaginary parts using above series for the questioned value, show values that do not equal zeros. (sorry!)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that a specific complex number they found isn't a counterexample to the Riemann Hypothesis. The number in question is z_! = 1/3 + a very large imaginary part, and when they computed the zeta function at this point, they got a value extremely close to zero. They suspect it might be a floating-point error or something non-analytic, but they need to prove it's not a counterexample.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). It states that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have a real part equal to 1/2. So, if z_! is a zero of zeta but has a real part not equal to 1/2, that would disprove RH. However, the user's example has a real part of 1/3, which is different from 1/2. So, if z_! were indeed a zero, that would contradict RH. But they think it's not a real zero.\n\nNow, the user's friend found that ζ(z_?) was close to zero, and after perturbing z_? by adding a small multiple of iε (epsilon = 1e-8) and searching over a large set of integers S, they found z_! with ζ(z_!) ≈ 0 (to the order of 1e-33). The user is skeptical because finding such a zero with real part 1/3 by random chance seems impossible, and the computation time was only 10 minutes, which might be too fast for such a large search.\n\nSo, the problem is to show that z_! isn't a counterexample to RH. How can one approach this?\n\nPossible angles:\n\n1. **Understanding the Zeros of Zeta**: RH says non-trivial zeros have Re(s)=1/2. Trivial zeros are at negative even integers. So any zero with Re(s)≠1/2 and not a negative even integer would be a counterexample. But the given z_! has Re(s)=1/3, which isn't 1/2 or a trivial zero location. Therefore, if it's a non-trivial zero, RH is false. However, the user's calculation might be incorrect.\n\n2. **Numerical Precision and Error**: The imaginary part of z_! is extremely large (~1e50 or more). Computing ζ(s) accurately for such large Im(s) is challenging. The user mentions floating-point errors or rounding errors. Standard algorithms for computing zeta at large heights require high precision and sophisticated methods. Mathematica's implementation might not handle such large Im(s) accurately, leading to false near-zero results.\n\n3. **Asymptotic Behavior of Zeta**: For large Im(s), the zeta function's behavior can be approximated using the Riemann-Siegel formula. The user could check the asymptotic approximations to see if the value should be near zero. Alternatively, if the imaginary part is so large, maybe the function's oscillations average out, but zeros are still expected on the critical line.\n\n4. **The Computational Time Factor**: The user's program ran for 10 minutes, which seems too short for checking 2e10 +1 points (since S is [-1e10,1e10]). Even if each ζ evaluation were fast, 2e10 operations in 10 minutes would require ~3e8 operations per second, which is unrealistic. This suggests that either the computation was parallelized beyond practical means, or Mathematica optimized the search in a way that skipped most points, or the actual number of evaluated points was much smaller. Alternatively, maybe the \"large subset\" S wasn't actually that large, or the step size wasn't 1. If ε is 1e-8, but they're moving in steps of k*epsilon, where k is integer, then the actual step in Im(z) is 1e-8 * k. But S is a huge range, so unless they used a sparse subset, the computation time is suspicious.\n\n5. **Possible Spurious Zeros from Numerical Methods**: Numerical algorithms can sometimes indicate zeros where none exist due to approximation errors, especially in regions where the function is rapidly oscillating or where the computations lose precision. At such high Im(s), the function oscillates rapidly, and standard precision might not capture the true value, leading to apparent zeros that aren't real.\n\n6. **Verification with Higher Precision**: The user could try recomputing ζ(z_!) with higher precision arithmetic (like using MPFR or Mathematica's arbitrary precision) to see if the zero persists. If increasing precision makes the value of ζ(z_!) move away from zero, it's likely a numerical artifact.\n\n7. **Check the Argument Principle**: If they can integrate the zeta function around a small contour containing z_!, they can count the number of zeros inside. However, this is computationally intensive, especially at such high Im(s).\n\n8. **Existing Zero Databases**: Check if there's any known zero near that imaginary part. But since the imaginary part here is astronomically large (1e50+), it's way beyond what's currently computed (zeros up to ~1e13 are known, all on the critical line).\n\nPutting this together, the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The imaginary part of z_! is extremely large (order 1e50 or similar).\n- The computed ζ(z_!) is near zero but with very small magnitude (1e-33).\n- The computation time was only 10 minutes for a supposedly large search space.\n- The real part is 1/3, not 1/2.\n\nThus, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\n- z_! is a complex number with real part 1/3.\n- z_! has an imaginary part with magnitude approximately 10^50.\n- ζ(z_!) is computed to be approximately 0 with magnitude on the order of 10^-33.\n- The computation to find z_! involved a search over a large subset of integers S with ε = 10^-8.\n- The computation time was 10 minutes.\n\nProblem: Show that z_! is not a counterexample to the Riemann Hypothesis.",
