    "Content": "Question is to prove : Irreducibility of $(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots (x-n)- 1$ over  $\\mathbb{Z}$ for all $n\\geq 1$ Irreducibility of $(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots (x-n)+ 1$ over  $\\mathbb{Z}$ for all $n\\geq 1$ and $n\\neq 4$ Hint for first bullet is If the polynomial factors consider the value of the factors at $x=1,2,\\dots,n$ For second bullet : Suppose $p(x)=(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots (x-n)-1$ is reducible we have: $p(x)=q(x)r(x)$ with $\\text {Max {degree of p(x), degree of r(x)}}<n$ Hint is suggesting me to use that $p(i)=-1$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$ i.e., $q(i)r(i)=-1$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$ i.e., $q(i)=-1; r(i)=1$ or $q(i)=1;r(i)=-1$  for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$ For second bullet : Suppose $p(x)=(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots (x-n)+1$ is reducible we have: $p(x)=q(x)r(x)$ with $\\text {Max {degree of p(x), degree of r(x)}}<n$ Hint is suggesting me to use that $p(i)=1$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$ i.e., $q(i)r(i)=1$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$ i.e., $q(i)=r(i)=1$ or $q(i)=r(i)=-1$  for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$ I am getting some vague ideas but could not bind them to prove this. I would be thankful if some one can help me to clear this. Thank you. P.S : Please give \"just hints\". Do not write whole answer at once. This is a \"request\". Thank you :) Edit : I have changed the title from Irreducibility of $(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots (x-n)\\pm 1$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$ to Existence of Irreducible polynomials over $\\mathbb{Z}$ of any given degree for two reasons : Irreducibility of $(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots (x-n)\\pm 1$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$ for any $n\\geq 1$ implies Existence of Irreducible polynomials over $\\mathbb{Z}$ of any given degree The title looks atractive",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Extended hints as requested Assume a factorization $p(x)=q(x)r(x)$. 1: $p(x)=(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots (x-n)-1$ As you observed, in this first case you get $q(i)=-r(i)=\\pm1$ for all $i=1,2,\\ldots,n$, so $q(x)+r(x)$ has at least $n$ zeros. This is a problem, because the leading coefficients of $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ have the same sign. 2: $p(x)=(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots (x-n)+1$ In the second case $q(i)=r(i)=\\pm1$ for all $i=1,2,\\ldots,n$, so we get that $q(x)-r(x)$ has at least $n$ zeros. As observed in the comments this leaves only the possibility $q(x)=r(x)$. Indeed, when $n=4$ we have\n$$\np(x)=(x^2-5x+5)^2.\n$$\nAnyway, the remaining case is that $n=2k$, $q(x)=r(x)$, $k=\\deg q(x)$. \nThe factorization $p(x)=q(x)^2$ shows that $p(x)\\ge0$ for all real numbers $x$. Estimate $p(2k-\\dfrac12)$ when $k>2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem by listing assumptions and then stating the problem clearly. \n\nFirst, let me read through the original question on Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about proving the irreducibility of two polynomials over the integers: one is (x-1)(x-2)...(x-n) minus 1, and the other is the same product plus 1, except for n=4 in the second case. The user also mentions some hints about evaluating the factors at integers 1 through n and considering the possible values of the factors there.\n\nSo, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem, the original question has two parts. The first part is to prove that (x-1)...(x-n) -1 is irreducible over Z for all n ≥1. The second part is similar but with +1 and the exception that n ≠4. \n\nThe user also mentions hints. For the first polynomial, when factoring, the values at x=1,...,n would be -1, leading to possible factors being -1 and 1. For the second polynomial, the values at those points would be 1, so factors would have to both be 1 or -1. \n\nBut the assumptions here would need to be the conditions given in the problem. The problem states \"for all n ≥1\" and \"for all n ≥1 and n≠4\". So these are the main conditions. Also, the polynomials are defined over the integers. \n\nWait, the problem is about irreducibility over Z, so the coefficients are integers, and we need to check if they can't be factored into lower-degree polynomials with integer coefficients. The original problem doesn't have any extra conditions except n being ≥1 and n≠4 for the second case. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nFor the first bullet:\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n- The polynomial is (x-1)(x-2)...(x-n) - 1.\n- The polynomial is considered over the integers.\n\nFor the second bullet:\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n- n is not equal to 4.\n- The polynomial is (x-1)(x-2)...(x-n) + 1.\n- The polynomial is considered over the integers.\n\nBut in the example given earlier, the assumptions were listed line by line, each as a separate condition. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So for the first problem, the key assumptions are that n is an integer, n ≥1, and the polynomial is over Z. Similarly for the second problem, n is integer, n ≥1, n ≠4, and the polynomial is over Z. \n\nBut wait, the problem is split into two bullets. So maybe the user wants each bullet as a separate problem? Let me check the original question again. The original problem has two parts: the first is about (x-1)...(x-n) -1 for all n≥1, and the second is (x-1)...(x-n)+1 for all n≥1 and n≠4. So these are two separate problems. However, the user combined them into one question. \n\nHowever, in the example given, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in the problem statement, it was a single problem. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the answer included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no, maybe there was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems wrong. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer, not that it's divisible by 7. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That seems like an error. \n\nWait, perhaps that example was a mistake? Or maybe it's a different problem. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo or the example is wrong. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption is n is an integer, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7. That seems inconsistent. Maybe that's an error. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the format. So in the current problem, the user's original question is to prove two things: \n\n1. (x-1)...(x-n) -1 is irreducible over Z for all n ≥1.\n\n2. (x-1)...(x-n) +1 is irreducible over Z for all n ≥1 and n ≠4.\n\nSo each of these is a separate problem. Therefore, the user might need to structure each problem separately. However, the example given by the user had multiple assumptions listed. But here, the problem statements themselves have conditions on n. \n\nTherefore, for the first problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n ≥ 1.\n\n- The polynomial is defined over Z.\n\nBut the problem is to prove irreducibility over Z. So maybe the key assumptions are n being integer ≥1, and the polynomial is (x-1)...(x-n) -1. Similarly for the second problem, n is integer ≥1, n ≠4, and the polynomial is (x-1)...(x-n) +1.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example included the divisibility condition as part of the assumptions. So following that, for the current problem:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the polynomial (x - 1)(x - 2)⋯(x - n) - 1 is irreducible over Z.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n ≥ 1.\n\n- n ≠ 4.\n\nProblem: Prove that the polynomial (x - 1)(x - 2)⋯(x - n) + 1 is irreducible over Z.\n\nBut the original problem in the user's example had two separate bullet points. However, in the given example, the user wrote the problem as two separate problems. But the original problem in the example combined them into one. Wait, in the user's example, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem listed two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by7) and the problem statement. However, that seems incorrect if the original problem states \"for every integer n\". \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the example provided by the user is not accurate, but in the current problem, we need to follow the user's instruction, even if the example might be flawed. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to list all the conditions that the problem states. For the first bullet in the original problem, the assumptions are n is an integer and n ≥1. For the second bullet, n is an integer, n ≥1, and n ≠4.\n\nTherefore, structuring each problem separately:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the polynomial (x - 1)(x - 2)⋯(x - n) - 1 is irreducible over Z.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n ≥ 1.\n\n- n ≠ 4.\n\nProblem: Prove that the polynomial (x - 1)(x - 2)⋯(x - n) + 1 is irreducible over Z.\n\nBut the user's example combined two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by7) into separate lines. So in this case, each assumption is a separate line. Therefore, for each problem, list each assumption on a separate line.\n\nSo the formatted answer would have:\n\nFor the first bullet:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the polynomial (x - 1)(x - 2)⋯(x - n) - 1 is irreducible over Z.\n\nFor the second bullet:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 1,\n\nn ≠ 4.\n\nProblem: Prove that the polynomial (x - 1)(x - 2)⋯(x - n) + 1 is irreducible over Z.\n\nBut the original question combines both bullets into one, but the user might want each as a separate problem. However, the user's example had only one problem. Wait, looking back at the user's instructions: \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example had one problem. But in this case, the original problem has two parts. \n\nThe user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps the entire problem, even if it has two parts, should be structured into assumptions and problem. However, the example split the original problem into a single problem with assumptions. \n\nWait, the example given was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems incorrect, since the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That seems like an error. But maybe that example was a mistake, but the user provided it as an example.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to include all conditions, even if they're part of the problem statement. But in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it. That's confusing. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I need to follow the user's format regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem has two parts. The first part is to prove the polynomial minus 1 is irreducible for n ≥1. The second part is the polynomial plus 1 is irreducible for n ≥1 and n ≠4. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the user wants each part to be a separate problem. However, the original question combines them into one. But the user's instruction says to structure \"that problem\" (singular) into the format. So maybe treat each bullet as a separate problem. But given that the original question is one question with two parts, perhaps the answer should have two problems. However, the example had one problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants both parts to be combined into one problem statement. But given the example, where the problem was restated concisely, perhaps in this case, the problem statement would be:\n\nProblem: Prove the following:\n\n1. The polynomial $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) - 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$ for all integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\n2. The polynomial $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$ for all integers $n \\geq 1$ and $n \\neq 4$.\n\nBut the example used a single problem statement. However, the user might expect to have two separate problem entries. But the format given in the example has \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\" sections. So perhaps each bullet point is a separate problem. Thus, the answer would have two separate formatted problems. \n\nBut the user's example didn't do that. The original example had one problem with two assumptions. But in this case, the original problem has two separate statements. The user might need to structure each as a separate problem. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we should follow the original problem's structure as two separate problems. However, the user's instruction says to structure \"that problem\", implying a single problem. But the original question has two problems. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to combine them into one problem statement with two parts. But the example didn't do that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the assumptions and problem as follows:\n\nAssumption: For the first part:\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- n ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) - 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAssumption: For the second part:\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- n ≥ 1,\n\n- n ≠ 4.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nBut since the user's example didn't split into multiple problems, but the current problem has two distinct parts, it's ambiguous. However, the user's example structured a single problem. Therefore, perhaps the answer should present each part as a separate formatted problem. \n\nBut the user's example showed that even if the original problem had a condition (for every integer n), the formatted problem listed assumptions, including n is an integer. So in this case, the original problem states \"for all n ≥1\", so the assumptions are n is integer, n ≥1. Similarly for the second part. \n\nThus, the formatted answer would be two separate problems:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) - 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 1,\n\nn ≠ 4.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nBut the user might want both in one problem? Since the original question mentions both, but the example had one problem. However, the user's example seems incorrect in adding an assumption not present in the original problem. So maybe follow the user's example structure but apply it to the current problem.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Unless there was a misunderstanding. Wait, 91 is 7×13. Maybe the original problem had a typo or the example was structured incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the example was from a different problem where n needs to be divisible by 7. But regardless, the user provided that as an example, so we have to follow the format where assumptions are extracted from the problem statement. \n\nIn the current problem, the first part says \"for all n≥1\", so the assumptions are n is integer and n≥1. The second part adds n≠4. So for each part, list the assumptions accordingly. \n\nTherefore, the formatted answer should have two separate problem entries. However, the user's instruction says to structure \"that problem\" (singular) into the format. Therefore, perhaps the answer should list both as separate problems within the same format. But given the example, which handled one problem, perhaps the answer should structure each bullet as a separate problem. \n\nBut the user's instructions might require combining them. Alternatively, the user might consider both statements as part of a single problem. However, the original problem is asking to prove both statements, so perhaps the formatted problem should include both. \n\nBut given the example, the user structured a single problem. Therefore, perhaps the answer should follow:\n\nAssumption: \n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the polynomial $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) - 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 1,\n\nn ≠ 4.\n\nProblem: Prove that the polynomial $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nBut this would be two separate formatted problems. However, the user might expect both in one answer. Given that the original question mentions both parts, but the example had one problem, maybe the answer should list both as separate entries. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem has two parts, maybe structure them as two separate problems under the same heading. However, the user's example didn't do that. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but aiming to follow the user's example as closely as possible, perhaps the answer is:\n\nFor the first part:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) - 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor the second part:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn ≥ 1,\n\nn ≠ 4.\n\nProblem: Prove that $(x - 1)(x - 2)\\cdots(x - n) + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, the formatted answer includes both parts as separate problems. However, the user might want them combined. But given the example's structure, each problem is separate. \n\nI think the correct approach is to present each part as a separate problem with their respective assumptions. Therefore, the final answer would be two formatted problems as above.",
