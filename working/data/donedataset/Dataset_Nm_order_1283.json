    "Content": "I know that $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a group under addition with a multiplication defined. I have just the definition of even and odd integers: $n$ is even if $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$ and $n$ is odd if $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Using just this I am wondering how to prove that all integers are either even or odd. That is, how can I prove that given an integer $n$, $n$ must be even or odd? My problem with this is that it seems so simple. I know that one can divide an integer by $2$ and the remainder will be $0$ or $1$. Using this, it is clear that the even and odd integers make up everything. But how can I prove it without using this fact about remainders and such? I guess one could also use facts about prime numbers, but I am looking for a proof that just uses the definition of odd and even.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you really want to avoid using general facts about division with remainder, you can use mathematical induction on $n$ to prove it for nonnegative integers: Base case: $0$ is even because $0=2\\cdot 0$. Induction step: Assume that $n$ is odd or even; then we must prove that $n+1$ is also either odd or even. First subcase: $n$ is even, so $n=2k$ for some $k$. Then $n+1=2k+1$ and so it is by definition odd. Second subcase: $n$ is odd, so $n=2k+1$ for some $k$. Then $n+1=2k+1+1=2k+2=2(k+1)$, and so $n+1$ is even. That completes the induction proof, and now we just need to know that negative integers are also all either odd or even. But if $n$ is negative, then $-n$ is positive. One easily sees that if $-n$ is even, then $n$ is even too, and if $-n$ is odd, then $n$ is odd too. Whether this satisfies your requirements is a bit debatable, because the induction part of the proof is essentially the same as how you prove that division with remainder works in general . However, you CANNOT prove that every integer is either odd or even solely from the fact that the integers form \"a group under addition with a multiplication defined\", that is a commutative ring with unit. The reason for this is that there are some rings where not all elements are either odd or even -- such as $\\mathbb Z[X]$, the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients. Here the polynomial $X+1$ is neither twice something, nor twice something plus one.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The example given includes listing assumptions line by line and then the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that all integers are either even or odd using only the definitions provided. The user mentioned they don't want to use facts about remainders or prime numbers, just the definitions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that an integer n is even if n=2k for some integer k, and odd if n=2k+1 for some integer k. The goal is to prove that every integer is either even or odd. \n\nSo, the assumptions here are the definitions of even and odd integers. Each definition should be a separate line. The problem statement is to show that all integers fall into one of these two categories. \n\nWait, but the original problem mentions that the user doesn't want to use remainders or division algorithm. So, maybe there's an implicit assumption that we're working within the integers under addition with some multiplication structure, as per the group mentioned in the title. However, the key assumptions are the definitions of even and odd. \n\nThe problem is to prove that every integer is even or odd. The example given in the format had an assumption about n being an integer and another about divisibility by 7, but here, the assumptions are the definitions. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the conditions applied to the object (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the definitions of even and odd are part of the problem's setup. So, how to list them as assumptions?\n\nWait, the example structured the problem's assumptions, not the definitions. The original problem in the example had an assumption that n is an integer and that it's divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem is more foundational—it's about the structure of integers themselves. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo, perhaps the assumptions here are that n is an integer, and the definitions of even and odd. But wait, the definitions are part of the problem's context. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the user is starting from the definitions. \n\nWait, the problem is to prove that all integers are either even or odd. The given definitions are the criteria for even and odd. So, the assumptions would be the definitions. But how to phrase them? Each assumption should be a single condition on one object. \n\nThe problem states: Using just the definitions, prove that every integer is even or odd. So, the assumptions are:\n\n- For an integer n, if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k, then n is even.\n- For an integer n, if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1, then n is odd.\n\nBut maybe the problem's assumptions are more about the structure of integers. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has no additional assumptions beyond the definitions. But according to the example, the original problem had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the problem's setup. In this case, the problem is about integers, so the assumption is that n is an integer. The other assumptions are the definitions of even and odd, but each as separate lines. Wait, but the example listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- An integer is even if it can be written as 2k for some integer k.\n- An integer is odd if it can be written as 2k+1 for some integer k.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So, n is an integer (the object is n, property is being integer). Then, the definitions of even and odd as separate assumptions. But maybe the problem is more about the structure of integers as a group under addition with multiplication defined, as mentioned in the title. Wait, the title says \"Proving that all integers are even or odd\" and the question mentions that Z is a group under addition with a multiplication defined. But the user wants to filter out unrelated information. The key points are the definitions of even and odd. The problem is to prove every integer is either even or odd using just those definitions, not relying on division with remainder. \n\nSo, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The set of integers, Z, is a group under addition.\n- A multiplication operation is defined on Z.\n- For any integer n, n is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k.\n- For any integer n, n is odd if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example only included the necessary conditions for the problem. The user may not need all the group structure, just the definitions. However, the original problem mentions that Z is a group under addition with multiplication defined, but the user says to filter out unrelated information. So perhaps the key assumptions are the definitions of even and odd. But the user wants to structure the problem with assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition to one object.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove that n is even or odd based on the definitions. But the problem itself is to show that for any integer, one of the two definitions applies. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- An integer is even if it equals 2k for some integer k.\n- An integer is odd if it equals 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nAn integer is even if it can be written as 2k for some integer k,\nAn integer is odd if it can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every integer is either even or odd.\n\nBut wait, the example had the assumptions as properties of the object (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the definitions of even and odd are part of the problem's framework. However, according to the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Similarly, here, the primary assumption is that n is an integer. The definitions of even and odd are given, but perhaps they are considered part of the problem's setup rather than assumptions. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the definitions, and the main assumption is that we're working within the integers. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nFor some integer k, n = 2k or n = 2k + 1.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that every integer is either even or odd, which is equivalent to saying that every integer can be written as 2k or 2k+1. So including that as an assumption would make the problem trivial. Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions of even and odd, and that n is an integer. But the problem is to show that every integer falls into one of these two categories. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- An integer is even if it can be expressed as 2k for some integer k.\n- An integer is odd if it can be expressed as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that every integer is either even or odd. So structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nAn integer is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k,\nAn integer is odd if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every integer is either even or odd.\n\nHowever, in the example, the assumptions were about the conditions on n (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the problem is more foundational, so the assumptions include the definitions. But maybe the problem's main assumption is that n is an integer, and the definitions are part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove that n is either even or odd, given the definitions. Therefore, the key assumption is that n is an integer. The definitions of even and odd are part of the problem's context. However, according to the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, so perhaps here we should do the same.\n\nBut the user wants to filter unrelated information. The original question mentions that Z is a group under addition with multiplication defined, but the user wants to focus on the core problem. So the key assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to show it's even or odd based on their definitions. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either even or odd, i.e., there exists an integer k such that n = 2k or n = 2k + 1.\n\nBut the user's example included the divisibility condition as an assumption. Wait, maybe I need to list the definitions as assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, looking at the example, the original problem might have had an error. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem's assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 13*7, so perhaps the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. So the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example provided by the user is not accurate. But according to the user's example, they restructured the problem by adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state that. That suggests that perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow their format regardless.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to filter out some information. Maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption, but in the example, the formatted problem added an extra condition. This is confusing. However, according to the user's instruction, we need to follow their example.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is about proving every integer is even or odd using the definitions. The user mentions not wanting to use division with remainders. So, the key is to structure the problem by listing the assumptions. The definitions of even and odd are given, and n is an integer. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- An integer is even if it equals 2k for some integer k.\n- An integer is odd if it equals 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n's properties. Here, the problem is to show that for any integer, it's even or odd. So the main assumption is that n is an integer. The other lines are definitions, but according to the example, perhaps they are considered part of the assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply to prove that every integer is even or odd, with the assumption that n is an integer, and the definitions are part of the problem statement.\n\nBut in the user's example, the problem was reformatted with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, leading to the problem of proving divisibility by 91. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- An integer is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k.\n- An integer is odd if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that every integer is either even or odd, which is exactly the conclusion. However, this seems circular. Maybe the problem is better structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either even (i.e., there exists an integer k such that n = 2k) or odd (i.e., there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1).\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement includes the expression to be proven, so the definitions might be part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions would just be that n is an integer. The problem is to show that n can be written in one of the two forms. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either even or odd, i.e., there exists an integer k such that n = 2k or n = 2k + 1.\n\nBut the original problem states the definitions of even and odd, so maybe they should be included as assumptions. Alternatively, since the definitions are part of the problem's context, they don't need to be listed as assumptions. But the example included an assumption about divisibility by 7, which wasn't in the original problem's statement. This suggests that the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. However, in the current problem, the key assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to use the definitions to prove the disjunction. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an integer k such that n = 2k or n = 2k + 1.\n\nAlternatively, keeping the terms even and odd as per the original problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either even or odd.\n\nBut the definitions of even and odd are part of the problem statement. So perhaps the formatted problem includes the definitions in the problem statement. However, the user's example included the expression A(n) with the formula, and the assumptions were about n. Therefore, in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either even (i.e., n = 2k for some integer k) or odd (i.e., n = 2k + 1 for some integer k).\n\nThis way, the assumptions are minimal, and the problem statement includes the definitions. But the user's example included the formula in the problem statement, so perhaps here, the definitions are part of the problem. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either even or odd, where an integer is even if it can be written as 2k for some integer k, and odd if it can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement includes the mathematical expression. So perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either even (n = 2k for some integer k) or odd (n = 2k + 1 for some integer k).\n\nAlternatively, as in the example, the problem statement includes the formula. So the problem statement would be:\n\nProve that for every integer n, there exists an integer k such that n = 2k or n = 2k + 1.\n\nWhich aligns with the user's example where the problem is restated with the formula. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumption that n is an integer and the problem statement as proving the disjunction.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This suggests that perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and we need to be careful. But following the user's instruction, the key is to list the assumptions from the problem. Since the current problem is to prove that every integer is even or odd, the only assumption needed is that n is an integer. The definitions are part of the problem's context. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either even or odd.\n\nBut the user's example included more detailed assumptions, so perhaps the definitions need to be listed as assumptions. However, the example's original problem had an assumption about divisibility by 7, which might have been part of the problem's hidden conditions, but in this case, the definitions are given. Therefore, perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nAn integer is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k,\nAn integer is odd if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every integer is either even or odd.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line, addressing one property of one object. So n is an integer is one line, then the definitions of even and odd as separate assumptions. However, the problem is to prove that every integer is even or odd, which is equivalent to saying that for every integer n, there exists k such that n=2k or n=2k+1. Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions, and the problem is to show the disjunction. Therefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nFor an integer to be even, there exists an integer k such that n = 2k,\nFor an integer to be odd, there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every integer is either even or odd.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the definitions should be considered as assumptions. In the example, the assumption was about n's properties, not the definitions. The example's original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, but the formatted problem added it. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\nBecause the problem is to prove that for every integer, it's even or odd. The definitions of even and odd are part of the problem's statement. But in the example, the problem was restated with the formula. So here, the problem statement would include the definitions. Therefore, the correct format is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either even or odd, i.e., there exists an integer k such that n = 2k or n = 2k + 1.\n\nThis way, the assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem statement includes the definitions in terms of the formulas. This matches the example where the problem statement included the formula for A(n).",
