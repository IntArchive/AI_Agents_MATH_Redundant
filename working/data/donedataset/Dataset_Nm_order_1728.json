    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint $f$ can't have a positive maximum at $c$ since then $f(c)>0, f'(c)=0, f''(c) \\le 0$ implies that $f''(c)+f'(c)-f(c) < 0$. Similarly $f$ can't have a negative minimum. Hence $f = 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original problem carefully.\n\nThe original problem states: A real-valued function f, infinitely differentiable on [a, b], has the properties that f(a) = f(b) = 0, and for all x in [a, b], f(x) = f'(x) + f''(x). We need to show that f(x) = 0 for all x in [a, b].\n\nLooking at the example provided, the key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem's assumptions:\n\n1. The function f is real-valued.\n2. f is infinitely differentiable on the interval [a, b].\n3. f(a) = 0.\n4. f(b) = 0.\n5. For all x in [a, b], f(x) = f'(x) + f''(x).\n\nEach of these points is a separate assumption. The problem then is to show that under these conditions, f(x) must be zero everywhere on the interval.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is listed individually. The user in the example included divisibility by 7 as a separate assumption, so here each condition (like f(a)=0) should be its own line. \n\nThe problem statement itself is straightforward: Show that f(x) = 0 for all x in [a, b].\n\nI should check if there's any hidden assumption or condition I might have missed. The function being infinitely differentiable is important, and the boundary conditions f(a) and f(b) being zero. The differential equation f = f' + f'' is the main equation governing the behavior of f. \n\nI don't see any other conditions mentioned in the original problem. The user tried Rolle's theorem but didn't get further, but that's part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So I don't need to include that in the formatted problem.\n\nNow, structuring it according to the format:\n\nAssumption: Each point as above.\nProblem: The statement to prove.\n\nSo the formatted version should look like:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a real-valued function,\nf is infinitely differentiable on [a, b],\nf(a) = 0,\nf(b) = 0,\nFor all x in [a, b], f(x) = f'(x) + f''(x).\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) = 0 for all x in [a, b].\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a separate line and concise. The differential equation is one assumption even though it's an equation involving derivatives, but since it's a single condition applied to f for all x, it's one line. The user's example had the condition on n being an integer and divisible by 7 as separate lines, but here, the differential equation is a single condition applied over the interval, so it's one line. The other conditions (f(a), f(b)) are separate.\n\nThis should fit the required format correctly.",
