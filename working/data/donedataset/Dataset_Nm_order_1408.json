    "Content": "There is a trigonometric identity: $$\\cos^2A+\\cos^2B+\\cos^2C+2\\cos A\\cos B\\cos C\\equiv 1\\text{ when }A+B+C=\\pi$$ It is easy to prove it in an algebraic way, just like that: $\\quad\\cos^2A+\\cos^2B+\\cos^2C+2\\cos A\\cos B\\cos C\\\\=\\cos^2A+\\cos^2B+\\cos^2\\left(\\pi-A-B\\right)+2\\cos A\\cos B\\cos \\left(\\pi-A-B\\right)\\\\=\\cos^2A+\\cos^2B+\\cos^2\\left(A+B\\right)-2\\cos A\\cos B\\cos \\left(A+B\\right)\\\\=\\cos^2A+\\cos^2B+\\left(\\cos A\\cos B-\\sin A\\sin B\\right)^2-2\\cos A\\cos B\\left(\\cos A\\cos B-\\sin A\\sin B\\right)\\\\=\\cos^2A+\\cos^2B+\\cos^2A\\cos^2B+\\sin^2A\\sin^2B-2\\sin A\\cos A\\sin B\\cos B-2\\cos^2A\\cos^2B+2\\sin A\\cos A\\sin B\\cos B\\\\=\\cos^2A+\\cos^2B-\\cos^2A\\cos^2B+\\left(1-\\cos^2A\\right)\\left(1-\\cos^2B\\right)\\\\=\\cos^2A+\\cos^2B-\\cos^2A\\cos^2B+1-\\cos^2A-\\cos^2B+\\cos^2A\\cos^2B\\\\=1$ Then, I want to find a geometric way to prove this identity, as $A+B+C=\\pi$ and it makes me think of the angle sum of triangle. However, it is quite hard to prove it in a geometric way. Therefore, I hope there is someone who can help. Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since the accent in the OP is put on a purely geometric solution, i can not even consider the chance to write $\\cos^2 =1-\\sin^2$ , and rephrase the wanted equality, thus having a trigonometric function which is better suited to geometrical interpretations. So this answer has two steps, first we reformulate the given identity in a mot-a-mot geometric manner, the geometric framework is introduced, some strictly geometrically transposed equivalent relations are listed, then we give a proof: In the triangle $\\Delta ABC$ let $AA'$ , $BB'$ , $CC'$ be the heights, $A'\\in BC$ , $B'\\in CA$ , $C'\\in AB$ , intersecting in $H$ , the orthocenter. We assume that the diameter $2R$ of the circumcircle is normed to be the unit. Then we have the following situation for the lengths of some segments in the picture: $$\n\\begin{aligned}\nAH &=\\cos A\\ , \\qquad & HA'&=\\cos B\\cos C\\ ,\\\\\nBH &=\\cos B\\ , \\qquad & HB'&=\\cos A\\cos C\\ ,\\\\\nCH &=\\cos C\\ , \\qquad & HC'&=\\cos A\\cos B\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ Proof: We have: $$\n\\sin \\hat B =\\sin \\widehat{C'HA}\n=\\frac{C'A}{AH}\n=\\frac{AC\\;\\cos A}{AH}\n=\\frac{2R\\sin B\\; \\cos A}{AH}\n=\\frac{\\sin B\\; \\cos A}{AH}\n\\ ,\n$$ which implies $AH=\\cos A$ , and the similar relations. Then we express twice the area of $\\Delta HBC$ as $$ HA'\\cdot BC =2[HBC]=HB\\cdot HC\\cdot \\sin\\widehat{BHC}\\ ,$$ thus getting $HA'=\\cos B\\cos C$ . We are in position to give a geometric mask to the given equality: We use the above notations in $\\Delta ABC$ . We denote by $a,b,c$ the lenghts of the sides. Let $M_A, M_B,M_C$ be the mid points of the sides $BC$ , $CA$ , respectively $AB$ . Let $G=AM_A\\cap BM_B\\cap CM_C$ be the intersection of the medians, the centroid. Let $A^*, B^*, C^*$ be the mid points of $HA$ , $HB$ , $HC$ . Let $N$ be the center of the Euler circle $(N)$ passing through the nine points $A',B',C'$ ; $M_A,M_B,N_C$ ; $A^*, B^*,C^*$ . It is the mid point of $OH$ , and $M_AA^*$ , $M_BB^*$ , $M_CC^*$ are diameters in $(N)$ , having the lenght $R=OA=OB=OC$ . (For $OM_AA^*A$ is a parallelogram.) Then we have the following relations: $$\n\\begin{aligned}\nHA^2+HB^2+HC^2 + 2 HA\\cdot HA' &= 4R^2\\ ,\\\\\nHA^*{}^2+HB^*{}^2+HC^*{}^2 + HA^*\\cdot HA' &= R^2\\ ,\\\\\n4OM_A^2+4OM_B^2+4OM_C^2   &= 3R^2+OH^2\\ ,\\\\\n9R^2 &= a^2 +b^2 + c^2  +OH^2\\\\\n9R^2 &= a^2 +b^2 + c^2  +9OG^2\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ Proof: The relations above are equivalent: $AH^2=4A^*H^2=4OM_A^2$ , and $2 HA\\cdot HA'=4 HA^*\\cdot HA'$ is the power of $H$ in the circle $(N)$ , so it can be rewritten using its radius $NA^*=\\frac 12 R$ and the distance to its center, $NH=\\frac 12 OH$ as $2 HA\\cdot HA'=4 HA^*\\cdot HA'=R^2-OH^2$ . From the triangle $OBM_A$ , $4OM_A^2+BC^2 =4(OM_A^2+BM_A^2)=4OB^2=4R^2$ . Note that $G$ cuts the median $AM_A$ in the proportion $AG:GM_A=2:1$ , so it  projects on $BC$ in the same proportion. This also holds for the colinear points $H,G,O$ , so $HG:GO=2:1$ , so $HO=3GO$ . The last relation, $OG^2 = R^2-\\frac 13(a^2+b^2+c^2)$ , is a standard formula. We have in general the formula for an arbitrary point $P$ : $$PA^2+PB^2+PC^2=GA^2+GB^2+GC^2+3GP^2\\ .$$ We apply it for $P=O$ , getting $3R^2=3OG^3+\\sum AG^2=3OG^3+\\frac 49\\sum AM_A^2=3OG^3+\\frac 49\\sum \\left(\\frac 12b^2+\\frac 12 c^2-\\frac 14 a^2\\right)=3OG^3+\\frac 49\\sum \\frac 34a^2=3OG^3+\\frac 13\\sum  a^2\\ .$ $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure the problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving a trigonometric identity: cos²A + cos²B + cos²C + 2cosAcosBcosC = 1 when A + B + C = π. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The main condition here is that the sum of angles A, B, and C is π radians. Since the problem states that A + B + C = π, that's one assumption. But do I need to break this down further? The example given in the problem had each assumption as a single property applied to one object. Here, the condition involves three angles summing to π. However, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" each as separate lines. So maybe here, even though the sum involves three angles, the assumption is that A, B, and C are angles such that their sum is π. But how to phrase it? The example uses \"n is an integer,\" so perhaps here it would be \"A, B, C are angles,\" and \"A + B + C = π.\" But wait, the original problem states \"when A + B + C = π,\" so maybe the assumption is just that single condition. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user included two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" But in the original problem, the only condition given was \"for every integer n,\" and the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems like the user added an extra assumption. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem changed it to assume n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Wait, no, maybe the original problem had the condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example given by the user, they restructured the problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they list assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect because if n is any integer, then why is n divisible by 7 an assumption? Unless the original problem actually required n to be divisible by 7. But maybe the example was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. The original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which would mean the only assumption is that n is an integer. However, in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7,\" which might not be part of the original problem. That seems like an error. But maybe there was a miscommunication. Anyway, moving back to the current problem.\n\nThe problem is to prove that cos²A + cos²B + cos²C + 2cosAcosBcosC = 1 when A + B + C = π. The key assumption here is that A, B, C are angles satisfying A + B + C = π. So according to the example's structure, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the angles A, B, C are three different objects. However, the condition is a collective one: their sum is π. So how to split this into separate lines? Alternatively, maybe list each angle's property. But since the condition is a relation among all three, perhaps the assumption is that A + B + C = π. So in the formatted problem, under assumptions, list \"A + B + C = π.\" But according to the example, each assumption is a single property for one object. For instance, \"n is an integer,\" which applies to n. Here, the condition involves three angles. However, perhaps in the context of the problem, the angles A, B, C are defined as angles of a triangle, which inherently sum to π. But the problem states \"when A + B + C = π,\" so the primary assumption is that sum. So in the formatted problem, the assumption would be \"A + B + C = π.\" But to adhere to the example's structure where each assumption is a single property applied to one object, perhaps we need to split it. However, A + B + C = π is a single condition involving three objects. Therefore, it might not be possible to split it into separate lines each addressing one object. Therefore, the correct way is to state the assumption as \"A + B + C = π\" as one line. The example might have had a mistake where they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though both apply to the same object. So following that, here we can have the assumption as \"A + B + C = π.\" \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA + B + C = π.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\cos^2A+\\cos^2B+\\cos^2C+2\\cos A\\cos B\\cos C=1$$.\n\nThat's the problem. The original problem's title and question mention that A, B, C are such that their sum is π, so the key assumption is that. There are no other assumptions stated. The problem is to prove the identity. So the formatted version should list the assumption as A + B + C = π, and the problem is to prove the given equation.",
