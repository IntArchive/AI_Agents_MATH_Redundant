    "Content": "$\\def\\e{{\\rm e}}$\nI recently had the task to explain the proof that $\\e$ is irrational as a presentation to my classmates. To prepare this presentation, the teacher gave me a script with a proof that uses an estimation of the series $b_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n1/k!\\ $ to show that there are no $p,q\\in\\mathbb N,\\ $ such that $\\e = p/q.$ Because we defined $\\e$ as the limit of $a_n = \\big(1+\\frac1n\\!\\big)^n\\ $ I had to include the rather long proof that $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}a_n-b_n=0,\\ $ rendering the whole proof quite long. Is there a “shorter” proof, given that $\\e$ is defined as the limit of $a_n$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(Too long for a comment.) This is probably the way you did it, but it doesn’t seem very long to me; where did it bog down? From the binomial theorem we have $$a_n = \\left(1 + \\frac1n \\right)^n = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k}n^{-k} = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^n \\frac{n^{\\underline k}}{k! n^k} \\le \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^n \\frac{1}{k!} = b_n.$$ For the other direction let $m>1$ be an integer; then $$a_{mn} = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{mn}\\frac{(mn)^{\\underline{k}}}{k!(mn)^k} \\ge \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^n\\frac{(mn)^{\\underline{k}}}{k!(mn)^k} \\ge \\left(\\frac{(mn)^{\\underline n}}{(mn)^n} \\right) b_n \\ge \\left(\\frac{m-1}{m} \\right)^n b_n,$$ and $\\displaystyle \\lim\\limits_{m\\to\\infty} \\left(\\frac{m-1}{m}\\right)^n = 1$, so $b_n \\le e$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nLooking at the title: \"Easy proof, that e ∉ ℚ\". So the main problem is proving that e is irrational. The user mentions that they had to use a proof involving the series b_n = sum_{k=0}^n 1/k! and show that there's no p, q in natural numbers such that e = p/q. But they defined e as the limit of a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n. The existing proof they used required showing that the limit of a_n - b_n is 0, making the proof long. They're asking if there's a shorter proof given that e is defined as the limit of a_n.\n\nNow, to structure this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object. The problem statement is to prove e is irrational, but with the specific context that e is defined as the limit of a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n, and the existing proof using the series b_n is too long because it requires showing the limit of a_n - b_n is 0. So the key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. e is defined as the limit of the sequence a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n.\n2. The existing proof uses the series b_n = sum_{k=0}^n 1/k! and shows no p, q in N exist such that e = p/q.\n3. The proof requires showing that the limit of (a_n - b_n) as n approaches infinity is 0, which makes the proof lengthy.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for a shorter proof under the assumption that e is defined via a_n. So the main assumptions to list would be those given in the problem setup. Let me check the example provided again. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem, not the existing proof's steps.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove e is not in Q (irrational), given that e is defined as the limit of a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n, and the user wants a shorter proof than the one using the series b_n and showing the limit of a_n - b_n = 0.\n\nSo the assumptions should include:\n\n- e is defined as the limit of the sequence a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity.\n- The proof should not require the series b_n = sum_{k=0}^n 1/k!.\n- The existing approach involves showing lim_{n→∞} (a_n - b_n) = 0, which is lengthy.\n\nBut the format requires each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse that.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"Prove that e is irrational. Because we defined e as the limit of a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n I had to include the rather long proof that lim_{n→∞} a_n - b_n = 0, rendering the whole proof quite long. Is there a shorter proof, given that e is defined as the limit of a_n?\"\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n1. e is defined as the limit of a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n.\n2. The existing proof uses the series b_n and shows lim (a_n - b_n) = 0.\n3. The task is to find a shorter proof without needing that limit step.\n\nBut in the problem formatting, the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. So the main assumption here is that e is defined as the limit of a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n. The existing method's steps (involving b_n and the limit) are part of the context but not assumptions. However, the user wants to know if there's a shorter proof under the given definition. So the assumption is the definition of e, and the problem is to prove e is irrational under that definition without the lengthy steps.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- e is defined as the limit of the sequence a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\n- Prove that e is irrational (i.e., e ∉ ℚ) without using the series b_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 1/k! and the limit lim_{n→∞} (a_n - b_n) = 0.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"Is there a 'shorter' proof, given that e is defined as the limit of a_n?\" So the problem is to prove e is irrational with the assumption that e is defined via a_n, and possibly avoiding the longer route involving b_n.\n\nTherefore, the main assumption is the definition of e, and the problem is to prove its irrationality under that definition, possibly seeking a more direct method.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumption is about the definition of e. So I need to list that.\n\nSo final answer:\n\nAssumption:\n- e is defined as the limit of the sequence a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that e is irrational (i.e., e ∉ ℚ).\n\nBut the user wants a shorter proof given this definition, so the problem is still to prove e is irrational, but under the assumption that e is defined via that specific limit. The original problem's context is that the existing proof uses the series and the limit comparison, which makes it long. So the formatted problem should reflect that the proof must use the definition of e as the limit of a_n and not the series b_n.\n\nWait, but the example given by the user for the format included specific assumptions about the problem's variables. Here, the assumption is about how e is defined, which is a premise of the problem. So the correct format would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real number e is defined as the limit of the sequence a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that e is not a rational number (i.e., e ∉ ℚ) without using the series expansion b_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 1/k!.\n\nBut the original problem mentions that the existing proof uses the series b_n and the limit of a_n - b_n, which the user wants to avoid. So perhaps the assumption is the definition of e, and the problem is to prove irrationality under that definition, possibly with the constraint of not using the series approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should include both the definition of e and the avoidance of the series b_n. However, the example provided in the user's instruction lists only the problem's conditions, not the method constraints. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which are conditions of the problem. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 under those assumptions.\n\nIn the current case, the problem's condition is that e is defined as the limit of a_n. The desire to avoid using the series b_n is part of the problem's request (a shorter proof) but not an assumption. Therefore, the problem statement should encapsulate the request for a proof under the given definition, possibly implying avoiding the longer route.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real number e is defined as the limit of the sequence a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that e is irrational, without utilizing the series expansion b_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 1/k! or the limit comparison between a_n and b_n.\n\nBut I need to check if the user's example included method constraints in assumptions. In the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties (n is integer, divisible by 7), not about the method. Therefore, the method constraints (not using series b_n) should be part of the problem statement, not assumptions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have the assumption about e's definition and the problem statement asking to prove e is irrational under that definition, possibly implying a different method than the one involving the series.\n\nBut the original problem states: \"Is there a 'shorter' proof, given that e is defined as the limit of a_n?\" So the problem is to prove e is irrational, with the assumption that e is defined via a_n, and the task is to find a shorter proof (without the long part involving the series b_n and the limit comparison). So the problem statement should reflect that.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real number e is defined as the limit of the sequence a_n = (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that e is irrational using the definition of e as the limit of a_n, without involving the series b_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 1/k! or proving that lim_{n→∞} (a_n - b_n) = 0.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement should just be \"Prove that e is irrational\" with the assumption being its definition, since the rest is context. However, the user wants the problem structured with assumptions and problem. The example included assumptions about the problem's variables, not about the definition. But in this case, the key given condition is the definition of e. So the assumption is the definition, and the problem is to prove irrationality under that definition.\n\nHence, the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe real number e is defined as the limit of the sequence $a_n = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n$ as $n$ approaches infinity.\nProblem: \nProve that e is irrational (i.e., $e \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$).",
