    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question about the sum of singular values of A+B. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking.\n\nThe question is to prove that the sum of the singular values of (A+B) is less than or equal to the sum of the singular values of A plus the sum of those of B. The user mentioned that σ_i are singular values ordered in decreasing order.\n\nFirst, I should check the original problem's assumptions. In the example provided, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the given problem here, there's no explicit mention of assumptions. Wait, but maybe there are implicit assumptions. Singular values are always non-negative and ordered, so that's given. Also, A and B must be matrices of the same dimensions because we're adding them. So the assumptions here would relate to properties of the matrices and their singular values.\n\nLet me list possible assumptions one by one. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\n1. A and B are matrices. (But maybe more precise, like n×n matrices? The problem uses σ_i up to n, so likely square matrices, but maybe not necessarily. However, singular values exist for any m×n matrix. The sum goes from i=1 to n, which might suggest that n is the number of singular values, which for an m×n matrix is min(m,n). So maybe the problem assumes A and B are square matrices of size n×n? Or maybe they are m×n matrices with the same dimensions, and n here refers to the number of singular values. Wait, the problem statement uses σ_i(A+B) summed from i=1 to n, same for A and B. Therefore, A, B, and A+B must all have at least n singular values. So the assumption is that A and B are matrices of the same dimensions, say m×n, and the singular values are considered in descending order, and we sum the first n of them. But perhaps the problem is assuming square matrices. Alternatively, the user might have intended that all matrices are n×n. However, the original question doesn't specify, so maybe the key assumptions are just that A and B are matrices of the same dimensions, and σ_i denotes their singular values in decreasing order.\n\nBut the example given in the problem had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't mention any divisibility or specific constraints on n beyond being the index for the singular values. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A and B are matrices of the same size.\n- The singular values of a matrix are ordered in non-increasing order: σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σₙ ≥ 0.\n- The sum is taken over the first n singular values of each matrix.\n\nWait, but the sum from i=1 to n of σ_i(A+B) ≤ sum of σ_i(A) + sum σ_i(B). That inequality is known for the sum of singular values, and it's related to the triangle inequality for the trace norm. However, the trace norm is the sum of all singular values. If the problem is summing up all singular values, then n would be the total number of singular values (i.e., the minimum of the rows and columns). But if the problem is summing up the first n singular values, then maybe there's a different condition. Wait, the original problem just says sum_{i=1}^n σ_i(A+B) ≤ sum_{i=1}^n σ_i(A) + sum_{i=1}^n σ_i(B). But in general, for any unitarily invariant norm, the triangle inequality holds. The sum of singular values is the trace norm, which is a norm, so it should satisfy the triangle inequality. However, the problem might be asking about a specific case.\n\nBut the problem as stated might not have additional assumptions beyond the basic properties of singular values. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- A and B are complex matrices of the same dimensions.\n- σ_i(X) denotes the i-th largest singular value of matrix X.\n- The singular values are ordered such that σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σ_n ≥ 0.\n\nBut the example given in the problem required listing each assumption line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are matrices of the same dimensions,\nσ_i(X) denotes the i-th largest singular value of matrix X,\nsingular values are ordered in non-increasing order,\nsummation is from i=1 to n where n is the number of singular values considered.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem. For instance, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the matrices beyond their dimensions. So the key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. A and B are matrices of the same size.\n2. The singular values of each matrix are ordered in non-increasing order (σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σ_n ≥ 0).\n3. The summation is over the first n singular values of each matrix.\n\nBut wait, n here could refer to the number of singular values, which is typically the minimum of the rows and columns. If A and B are m×n matrices, then each has min(m,n) singular values. If A+B is also m×n, then it has the same number. So perhaps the assumption is that A, B, and A+B are m×n matrices, and the summation is over all their singular values. But the original problem states \"sum_{i=1}^n σ_i(A+B)\", so maybe n is a fixed integer, perhaps the number of singular values considered, which could be less than the total number. However, the problem doesn't specify any particular n, so perhaps it's assumed that the matrices are square and n is their size. Alternatively, n could be any positive integer such that the matrices have at least n singular values.\n\nBut since the problem statement doesn't specify, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- A and B are complex matrices of the same dimensions.\n- σ_i(X) is the i-th largest singular value of matrix X.\n- The inequality holds for all n such that the matrices have at least n singular values.\n\nBut to fit the example format, where each assumption is a single line for one property applied to one object, I need to list them properly.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are matrices of the same dimensions,\nσ_i(X) denotes the i-th largest singular value of matrix X,\nsingular values are ordered non-increasingly.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question already states that σ_i are ordered as σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σ_n ≥0, so that's part of the problem's given. Therefore, the assumptions to list would be:\n\n- A and B are matrices of the same dimensions.\n- For each matrix, the singular values are ordered such that σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σ_n ≥ 0.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"sum_{i=1}^n σ_i(A+B)\", so n here is the upper limit of the summation. So perhaps the assumption is that we are summing the first n singular values of each matrix, where n is a positive integer. But without more context, it's possible that the problem is considering the sum of all singular values (i.e., the trace norm). However, the inequality ∑σ_i(A+B) ≤ ∑σ_i(A) + ∑σ_i(B) is the triangle inequality for the trace norm. But maybe the problem is more general, allowing n to be any number up to the rank of the matrices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the Ky Fan norms, which are the sum of the first k singular values. In that case, the inequality holds for Ky Fan norms as well, which is a known result.\n\nBut regardless, the user wants the assumptions listed line by line. The key points here are:\n\n1. A and B are matrices of the same size. (Otherwise, A+B isn't defined.)\n2. The singular values of each matrix are ordered in non-increasing order.\n3. The summation is over the singular values from i=1 to n.\n\nBut the original problem statement already specifies that σ_i are the singular values with σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σ_n ≥0, so that's part of the problem's conditions. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- A and B are matrices of the same dimensions.\n- The singular values of a matrix are ordered in non-increasing order.\n\nBut maybe also:\n\n- The sum is taken over the first n singular values.\n\nBut the problem statement already says \"sum_{i=1}^n\", so n is given. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's original setup. In this case, the problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange doesn't specify any restrictions on n, except that it's summing up to n. So perhaps the only assumptions are about the matrices and their singular values.\n\nSo, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are matrices of the same dimensions,\nFor each matrix, its singular values are ordered as σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σ_n ≥ 0.\n\nBut wait, the \"σ_n ≥0\" is inherent to singular values, which are always non-negative, so that's a property, not an assumption. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. A and B are matrices such that A+B is defined (i.e., same dimensions).\n2. The singular values of each matrix are arranged in non-increasing order.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those assumptions.\n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example seems to have a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which actually restricts n. That seems incorrect. Unless maybe the original problem had a typo and the user corrected it. But perhaps that example is illustrative, not an actual correct example. So maybe the user wants to extract the assumptions as per the original problem, but sometimes the original problem might have unstated assumptions. But in the given case here, the problem is stated as:\n\n\"How we can prove that: sum_{i=1}^n σ_i(A+B) ≤ sum_{i=1}^n σ_i(A) + sum_{i=1}^n σ_i(B) Where σ_i's are singular values σ₁≥σ₂≥⋯≥σ_n≥0.\"\n\nSo the problem itself states that σ_i are the singular values ordered in non-increasing order, and that the inequality should hold. The assumptions needed are:\n\n- A and B are matrices of the same dimensions (so that A+B is defined).\n- The singular values are ordered as given.\n\nSo the assumptions should list:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are matrices of the same dimensions,\nFor each matrix, the singular values are ordered such that σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σ_n ≥ 0.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a separate line. So each bullet point is one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are matrices of the same dimensions,\nσ_i denotes the i-th largest singular value of a matrix,\nsingular values are ordered as σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σ_n ≥ 0.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each of these is a separate condition. The first ensures A+B is defined. The second defines σ_i, and the third specifies the ordering.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are matrices of the same dimensions,\nσ_i denotes the i-th largest singular value of a matrix,\nsingular values are ordered as σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ … ≥ σ_n ≥ 0.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_i(A+B)\\leq\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_i(A)+\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_i(B).$$",
