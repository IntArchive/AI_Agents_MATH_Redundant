    "Content": "Below is my question. Q7.9 is what I'm stuck on. I've done Q7.8; I included it in the picture because I'll use it in Q7.9, and it gives a definition that I'll use. Update: This question is now solved, and I've added the details below. What I've done so far is this: By using time-inversion, $(tB_{1/t})_{t\\ge0}$, and $(-B_t)_{t\\ge0}$, sign-inversion of Brownian motion, we have that the four random variables in question are all equal to each other. Further, we see that the first is $\\mathcal{F}_{0^+}$ measurable, since $$ \\limsup_{t \\to 0} \\frac{B_t}{\\sqrt{t}} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\sup_{t \\le s} \\frac{B_s}{\\sqrt{s}}, \\ \\text{and} \\ \\sup_{t \\le s} \\frac{B_s}{\\sqrt{s}}$$ is $\\mathcal{F}_s$ measurable for all $s > 0$, and thus the limit is $\\mathcal{F}_{0^+}$ measurable. Hence by Blumenthal's $0$-$1$ law, it is almost surely constant. Hence we now have that the four random variables in question are equal to each other and almost surely constant. Since $\\mathbb{P}(B_{t'} > 0) = 1/2$ for all $t' > 0$, by the Markov property, we have that the almost sure constant must be at least $0$. I'm stuck on showing that this constant is in fact $+\\infty$. I wanted to use the scaling property, $(cB_{t/c^2})_{t\\ge0}$, of Brownian motion, but the issue is that this gives $$\\frac{cB_{t/c^2}}{\\sqrt{t}} = \\frac{B_{t/c^2}}{\\sqrt{t/c^2}} = \\frac{B_s}{\\sqrt{s}}$$ where $s = t/c^2$. When considering just $B_t$ or $B_t/t$, we get a factor $c$ or $1/c$ out the front, and so, since this must hold for all $c$, we know that it must be $0$ or $\\infty$. (We can then show which it is.) However, we don't get this nice property when using $B_t/\\sqrt{t}$. Solution: Define $A^x_t$ and $A^x$ as follows:\n$$A^x_t = \\left\\{ \\sup_{s \\le t} \\frac{B_s}{\\sqrt{s}} \\le x \\right\\}, ~\nA^x = \\left\\{ \\lim_{t \\downarrow 0}\\sup_{s \\le t} \\frac{B_s}{\\sqrt{s}} \\le x \\right\\}\n= \\left\\{ \\limsup_{t \\downarrow 0} \\frac{B_s}{\\sqrt{s}} \\le x \\right\\}.$$\nObserve that $B_t/\\sqrt{t} \\sim N(0,1)$. Thus, since $\\sup_{s \\le t} {B_s}/{\\sqrt{s}} \\ge {B_t}/{\\sqrt{t}}$,\n$$P \\left( \\sup_{s \\le t} \\frac{B_s}{\\sqrt{s}} \\le x \\right) \\le P \\left( \\frac{B_t}{\\sqrt{t}} \\le x \\right) = \\Phi(x),$$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the cdf for the standard normal. We want to show that $P(A^x) = 0$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ ($\\therefore x \\neq \\infty$); by Blumenthal's $0$-$1$ law, it is enough to show that $P(A^x) < 1$. Now, $A^x_{1/n} \\downarrow A^x$ as $n \\to \\infty$, so by monotone convergence,\n$$P(A^x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}P(A^x_{1/n}) \\le \\Phi(x) < 1, \\ x \\in \\Bbb R.$$\nThus $P(A^x) < 1$, ie $P(A^x) = 0$, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus the almost sure constant must be $+\\infty$. Thank you to Jay.H for helping me with this!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Try to use the fact that $B_t/\\sqrt{t}$ has the same distribution as $B_1$ and the fact that $\\sup_{s\\le t }B_s/\\sqrt{s}$ is monotonic w.r.t. $t$ [Warning: more details below] For any constant $C>0$, let \n$$ A = (\\lim_{t\\to 0} \\sup_{0<s\\le t}\\frac{B_s}{\\sqrt{s}}<C )$$\nWe want to show that $P(A)=0$. Since $A\\in {\\mathcal F}_{0+}$, we only have to show that $P(A)<1$. Let\n$$ A_n = (\\sup_{0<s\\le \\frac{1}{n}}\\frac{B_s}{\\sqrt{s}}<C)$$\nThen\n$$ P(A_n) \\le P(\\frac{B_{1/n}}{\\sqrt{1/n}}<C) = P(B_1<C)$$\nSince $ A_n \\uparrow A$, we have\n$$ P(A) = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} P(A_n) \\le P(B_1<C) <1$$\nDone.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully. The title is about lim sup and lim inf of Brownian Motion, specifically B_t over sqrt(t) as t approaches infinity or zero. The user is stuck on Q7.9, which they mention in the question.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The user talks about Q7.8, which they've already solved, and includes some details about their approach, like using time-inversion and sign-inversion of Brownian motion. They also mention Blumenthal's 0-1 law and that the lim sup is measurable with respect to F_0+. The solution part explains how they eventually solved it with help, but I need to focus on the problem statement they were originally stuck on.\n\nThe main problem here is about showing that the lim sup of B_t/sqrt(t) as t approaches 0 is almost surely infinity. The user had established that the lim sup is an almost sure constant (due to Blumenthal's law) and that it's at least zero, but needed to show it's actually infinity. The assumptions here would relate to the properties of Brownian Motion used in their reasoning.\n\nSo, to list the assumptions, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object:\n\n- Brownian motion B_t is considered.\n- The time-inversion property of Brownian motion is applied (i.e., tB_{1/t} is a Brownian motion).\n- The sign-inversion property of Brownian motion is applied (i.e., -B_t is a Brownian motion).\n- Blumenthal's 0-1 law is applicable to the lim sup as t approaches 0.\n- The lim sup is F_0+ measurable.\n- The lim sup of B_t/sqrt(t) as t approaches 0 is almost surely constant.\n- The scaling property of Brownian motion (cB_{t/c²} is a Brownian motion) is used.\n- The probability P(B_t > 0) = 1/2 for any t > 0.\n\nEach of these points is a separate assumption. However, some of these might be considered part of the problem's context rather than explicit assumptions. The problem is to prove that the lim sup is infinity. But the user's problem is specifically Q7.9, which I need to extract.\n\nLooking back, the problem statement the user was stuck on is: Show that the almost sure constant (lim sup of B_t/sqrt(t) as t approaches 0) is +infty. So the problem is to prove that the lim sup is infinity.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions based on the necessary conditions for solving the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- B_t is a Brownian motion.\n- The lim sup as t approaches 0 of B_t/sqrt(t) is F_0+ measurable.\n- Blumenthal's 0-1 law applies, implying the lim sup is almost surely constant.\n- The scaling property of Brownian motion holds (invariance under scaling).\n- For any t > 0, P(B_t > 0) = 1/2.\n\nEach of these should be listed line by line. The problem is to prove that the lim sup is +infty.",
