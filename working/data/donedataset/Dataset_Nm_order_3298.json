    "Content": "Let $\\gamma:S^1\\rightarrow S^1\\times[0,1]\\ $ be a closed continuous path on an annulus, with endpoints on a point in the boundary.\nAssume that $\\gamma\\ $ circles the annulus twice (For a precise definition we can integrate over the angle or use degree of a map). How do you show that $\\gamma\\ $ is self intersecting (not counting the endpoints intersection obviously)? I tried lifting $\\gamma$ to a path on $\\mathbb{R}\\times[0,1]$ , and using the intermediate value theorem somehow, but it didn't work out. Then I thought of looking at two lifts of $\\gamma$ that start at a \"distance of one rotation\" from each other, and showing that they intersect. It would've been straight forward if I knew that a path splits the space to two connected components, but for that I believe that I need something like Jordan curve theorem which feels like a complete overkill. Is there a nice proof of this claim? Extras: If there are easier solutions for smooth paths, I'm also interested in seeing them. I'd like to see a similar proof (or a contradiction) for a path on a Torus, that rotates twice in one directions and 0 times in the second direction.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your assumption that \" $\\gamma$ circles the annulus twice\" can be restated as the condition that $\\gamma$ represents the square of a generator of $\\pi_1(A)$ , where $A$ is the annulus $S^1\\times [0,1]$ . For some reason, you are assuming that the end-points of $\\gamma$ are on the boundary of the annulus. By embedding the annulus $A=S^1\\times [0,1]$ in $A'=S^1\\times [-1,2]$ , we achieve that the same loop $\\gamma$ is disjoint from $\\partial A$ and still represents the square of a generator of $\\pi_1(A')$ . Thus, I will be proving: Lemma. Let $A$ be an annulus and $\\gamma$ is a simple loop in $A$ disjoint from $\\partial A$ . Then $\\gamma$ cannot represent the the square of a generator of $\\pi_1(A)$ . Proof. Suppose that the image $c$ of $\\gamma$ (a simple loop) does represent the square of the generator  of $\\pi_1(A)$ . Let $p: \\tilde{A}= {\\mathbb R}\\times [0,1]\\to A$ denote the universal covering and let $G$ denote its group of covering transformations. Set $L:=p^{-1}(c)$ . Since $\\gamma$ represents the square of $\\alpha$ , the preimage $L$ consists of exactly two connected components $L_0, L_1$ , each of which is homeomorphic to ${\\mathbb R}$ (the universal cover of $c$ ) and the generator $g$ of $G$ satisfies: $$\ng: L_0\\to L_1, g: L_1\\to L_0.\n$$ Moreover, the topological line $L_0$ is invariant under the index 2 subgroup $G_0< G$ . From this, it follows that $L_0$ is properly embedded in ${\\mathbb R}\\times [0,1]\\subset {\\mathbb R}^2$ , i.e. every sequence in $L_0$ either contains a convergent subsequence (whose limit is in $L_0$ because it is closed in $\\tilde{A}$ ) or diverges to $\\infty$ . Thus, compactifying $L_0$ in the Riemann sphere ${\\mathbb R}^2\\cup \\{\\infty\\}=S^2$ , we obtain a Journal curve $J\\subset S^2$ , a simple topological loop. Now, I use the Jordan curve theorem: Yes, this is necessary for the proof. It follows that $L_0$ separates $\\tilde{A}$ in two components $L_0^\\pm$ . The component $L_0^-$ contains the line $\\{0\\}\\times {\\mathbb R}$ and the other component $L_0^+$ contains the line $\\{1\\}\\times {\\mathbb R}$ . The same applies to  the topological line $L_1$ . Since the topological lines $L_0, L_1$ are disjoint, $L_1$ is contained in one of the components $L_0^\\pm$ . Let's assume that it is contained in $L_0^+$ (the other case is handled by switching the roles of $L_0, L_1$ ). Note that since $A$ is an annulus (rather than the Moebius band!), $G$ preserves each   boundary line of the strip $\\tilde{A}$ . Hence, the condition that $L_1\\subset L_0^+$ implies $$\ng(L_0^+)=L_1^+ \\subset L_0^+, \n$$ and $g(L_0)=L_1\\subset L_0^+$ . Applying $g$ again,\nwe also obtain $$\ng^2(L_0)=g(L_1)\\subset g(L_0^+)\\subset L_0^+. \n$$ Thus, we cannot possibly have the equality $g^2(L_0)=L_0$ . A contradiction. qed A version of this proof works in greater generality and one obtains: Proposition. Suppose that $S$ is a connected orientable surface and $c$ is a simple loop in $S$ representing an element $h\\in \\pi_1(S)\\setminus \\{1\\}$ . Then there is no $n\\ge 2$ and $g\\in \\pi_1(S)$ such that $h=g^n$ . Note that this proposition is false for non-orientable surfaces, the Moebius band is the simplest example: You take $g$ represented by the \"middle loop\" of the Moebius band. Then $g^2$ is represented by a simple loop. But, essentially, this is the  only counter-example. All other examples come from squares of central loops in Moebius bands in non-orientable surfaces.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that a path winding around an annulus twice must intersect itself. First, I need to parse the question correctly. The original problem mentions a closed continuous path γ on an annulus S¹×[0,1], with endpoints on the boundary (but since it's a closed path, the endpoints are the same point). The key assumption is that γ circles the annulus twice. The goal is to show that γ must self-intersect, not counting the endpoint.\n\nHmm, the user tried lifting to the universal cover ℝ×[0,1], which makes sense because the annulus's universal cover is the infinite strip. When you lift a loop that winds around the annulus twice, the lifted path should connect two points that differ by a translation of 2π (or 2 in the unit circle terms) in the angular direction. But how does that help with self-intersection?\n\nThe user mentioned using the intermediate value theorem or looking at two lifts separated by one rotation. Let me think: if you have two lifts starting at (0,0) and (1,0) in the strip, then after the path winds twice, the first lift would go from 0 to 2, and the second from 1 to 3. If these two paths cross each other somewhere in the strip, that would project down to a self-intersection. But how to formalize that crossing?\n\nAlternatively, consider the path in the annulus. Since it winds around twice, when you lift it to the strip, the lifted path goes from (x,0) to (x + 2,0) maybe. If we assume the path doesn't intersect itself, then the lifted path in the strip should be a simple curve. But maybe by the covering space properties, the different lifts must intersect? Wait, in the strip, if you have two lifts starting at different x positions but both covering the same path, they might cross. For example, one lift starting at 0 and another starting at 1. After some time, the first path is at 0 + 2θ(t), and the second at 1 + 2θ(t). If the paths are continuous and θ(t) goes from 0 to 1 (since the total winding is 2), then θ(t) would be a function from [0,1] to [0,1]. Wait, maybe parametrize the angle as going from 0 to 2π twice, so θ(t) goes from 0 to 2. Then the lifts would start at 0 and 1, and end at 2 and 3. If you can show that these two paths must cross somewhere in between, that would imply a self-intersection. How to apply the intermediate value theorem here?\n\nAlternatively, think about the path as a map from S¹ to S¹×[0,1]. The winding number is 2 around the annulus. Suppose we parameterize the path as (θ(t), r(t)) where θ(t) is the angle and r(t) is the radius in [0,1]. Since it winds twice, θ(1) - θ(0) = 4π (since S¹ is 2π periodic). But since the path is closed, θ(1) = θ(0) mod 2π. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no: the total change in angle is 2*2π = 4π, but since the path is closed, the net change is a multiple of 2π. So, θ(1) = θ(0) + 4π. When lifted to the universal cover ℝ, θ(t) goes from θ(0) to θ(0) + 4π. But when projected back to S¹, this is a loop that winds around twice.\n\nNow, suppose the path does not intersect itself. Then, the lifted path in the strip ℝ×[0,1] would be a simple curve from (θ(0), r(0)) to (θ(0) + 4π, r(1)) but since the original path is closed, r(1) = r(0). Wait, maybe I'm mixing parameters. Let me try again.\n\nLet’s model the annulus as S¹ × [0,1], where S¹ is parameterized by θ ∈ [0, 2π). The path γ: S¹ → S¹×[0,1] is a closed loop, so γ(0) = γ(1) (if parameterized on [0,1]). The winding number around the annulus is 2, meaning that the projection of γ onto the S¹ component has degree 2. That is, when you look at the angular component θ(t), it starts at θ(0) and ends at θ(1) = θ(0) + 4π (mod 2π). But in the universal cover, which is ℝ×[0,1], the lift of θ(t) would be a continuous function from 0 to 4π as t goes from 0 to 1.\n\nNow, consider two points in the universal cover: starting at (0, r0) and ending at (4π, r0). If the path is simple, then the lifted path is a simple arc from (0, r0) to (4π, r0). But in the strip, you can compare this path to another path shifted by 2π. Suppose we take another lift starting at (2π, r0). The original path and the shifted path must cross by some argument, maybe the Jordan curve theorem? But the user mentioned avoiding JCT.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the path in the strip goes from 0 to 4π. Split it into two halves: from 0 to 2π and 2π to 4π. If the first half is from 0 to 2π and the second from 2π to 4π, then if the path doesn't intersect itself, the two halves don't cross. But maybe by continuity, the first half must cross the shifted second half. Wait, this is getting vague.\n\nAnother approach: use the fact that the fundamental group of the annulus is ℤ, generated by the loop around the hole. A loop with winding number 2 is not null-homotopic, but that's not directly helpful. However, maybe using covering spaces again. The universal cover is the strip, and the deck transformation is shifting by 2π in the angular direction. If the lift of γ connects (0, r0) to (4π, r0), then applying the deck transformation once would give a path from (2π, r0) to (6π, r0). If the original path and the shifted path intersect in the strip, then γ has a self-intersection. To show that these two paths must cross, maybe use the intermediate value theorem on the difference of their angular coordinates.\n\nLet’s define two functions: θ(t) and θ(t) + 2π. Since the first goes from 0 to 4π and the second from 2π to 6π. The difference between θ(t) and θ(t) + 2π is 2π, but maybe considering their vertical positions (the radius component). If the path is non-self-intersecting, then the lifted paths in the strip don't cross. But since the original path is in the annulus, if two points in the strip project to the same point in the annulus, they must differ by a deck transformation. So, if the lifted path and its shifted version intersect, then the original path has a self-intersection.\n\nSo, suppose γ is a path in the annulus with winding number 2, and suppose it doesn't self-intersect. Then its lift to the strip is a simple path from (0, r0) to (4π, r0). Now, consider the shifted lift starting at (2π, r0) which would end at (6π, r0). Since the original path is in the annulus, these two lifted paths cannot intersect, because that would imply a self-intersection. But can they avoid each other?\n\nWait, in the strip, the two paths are θ1(t) going from 0 to 4π with some radius r(t), and θ2(t) = θ1(t) + 2π going from 2π to 6π with the same r(t). If the original path is non-self-intersecting, then θ1(t) and θ2(t) must not cross. But since θ2(t) = θ1(t) + 2π, their radial components must also not cross. Wait, maybe look at the function θ1(t) - θ2(s) and r1(t) - r2(s). But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function f(t) = θ(t) - 2π t, where θ(t) is the lifted angle. Since the total change is 4π over t from 0 to 1, then 2π t would go from 0 to 2π. So, f(t) = θ(t) - 2π t goes from 0 to 4π - 2π*1 = 2π. Wait, no: θ(t) goes from 0 to 4π, so f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0, f(1) = 4π - 2π*1 = 2π. So f(t) increases by 2π. Similarly, consider another function g(t) = θ(t) - 2π t - 2π. Then g(0) = -2π, g(1) = 4π - 2π - 2π = 0. So g(t) goes from -2π to 0. By the intermediate value theorem, there must be some t where f(t) = g(s), i.e., θ(t) - 2π t = θ(s) - 2π s - 2π. Rearranging, θ(t) - θ(s) = 2π(t - s + 1). If there exists t and s such that this holds and r(t) = r(s), then the points (θ(t), r(t)) and (θ(s), r(s)) project to the same point in the annulus, implying a self-intersection. But I need to formalize this argument.\n\nAlternatively, think of the path as having a winding number 2, so when you go around the annulus once (from t=0 to t=1/2), you wind around once, and then another time from t=1/2 to t=1. If the path doesn't intersect itself, these two halves must not cross. But how to show that they must cross?\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that in the annulus, a loop with winding number 1 separates the annulus into two components, similar to the JCT. But if you have a loop winding twice, maybe it doesn't separate, but if it's simple, then it does separate. Wait, but the user wants to avoid using JCT. However, maybe for the annulus, there's a simpler argument.\n\nAlternatively, consider cutting the annulus along a radial line, making it a rectangle [0, 2π] × [0,1]. Then the path that winds twice would cross this cut twice. If you draw this on the rectangle, a non-self-intersecting path would have to alternate directions when crossing the cut, but with two crossings, maybe it's forced to intersect.\n\nAlternatively, parameterize the path as (θ(t), r(t)) where θ(t) is monotonically increasing from 0 to 4π. But since in the annulus, θ is modulo 2π, this would mean that θ(t) wraps around twice. If the path is simple, then r(t) must vary in a way that when θ(t) crosses 2π, the radial component r(t) must move to a different level to avoid crossing. But then when θ(t) goes from 2π to 4π, which is equivalent to 0 to 2π in the annulus, but with r(t) different. However, since the path is closed, r(1) = r(0). So, you start at (0, r0), go around to (2π, r1), then continue to (4π, r0) which is (0, r0). If r(t) increases and then decreases, there must be a point where it overlaps. Maybe use the intermediate value theorem on r(t) - r(t + 0.5). Wait, if you split the path into two halves, each winding once, then their radial components must cross somewhere, leading to an intersection.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe going back to the lifting argument. Suppose we have the lifted path in the strip from (0, r0) to (4π, r0). If we shift this path by -2π, we get a path from (-2π, r0) to (2π, r0). The original path and the shifted path must cross somewhere between 0 and 2π. If they cross, then there's a point (x, y) on both paths, meaning the original path has a point at (x, y) and (x + 2π, y), which projects to the same point in the annulus, hence a self-intersection. To prove the crossing, use the intermediate value theorem on the difference of their x-coordinates. Let’s define a function d(t) = θ(t) - (θ(s) - 2π) for some s. Hmm, perhaps a better way: Consider the two paths γ1(t) = (θ(t), r(t)) and γ2(t) = (θ(t) - 2π, r(t)). Both are lifts of the original path. If γ1(t) and γ2(s) ever coincide, then θ(t) ≡ θ(s) - 2π mod 2π and r(t) = r(s), which implies a self-intersection. To show that such t and s exist, consider the function f(t) = θ(t) - θ(t') - 2π where t' is a parameter shifted by half the interval. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think of the two lifts: one starting at (0, r0) and ending at (4π, r0), and another starting at (2π, r0) and ending at (6π, r0). These two paths are in the strip. If the original path is embedded (no self-intersections), then these two lifted paths cannot intersect each other. But the area between them is a region that must be covered or not. Maybe using the Jordan-Brouwer theorem, but that's again heavy.\n\nWait, here's a simpler argument using the pigeonhole principle. Since the path winds around twice, consider any radial line (a line from the inner boundary to the outer boundary). The path must cross this radial line at least twice. If the path is simple, each crossing alternates direction (from inward to outward or vice versa). But with two crossings, the path would have to loop around once, cross back, and then loop around again. But with two crossings on the radial line, the path would form two loops, which must intersect each other. This is similar to the argument that a simple closed curve on the annulus with winding number ±1 is essential, but with winding number 2, it can't be simple. However, formalizing this requires more precise topological reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, consider the universal cover again. The path lifts to a curve from (0, r0) to (4π, r0). Now, consider the middle part of this path: at some point t=1/2, the lifted path is at (2π, r(1/2)). Now, connect (0, r0) to (2π, r(1/2)) and (2π, r(1/2)) to (4π, r0). If the path is simple, these two halves don't cross. But then, when projected back to the annulus, each half is a loop winding once around. If both halves are on different sides of the annulus, they might not cross. But since the entire path is continuous, the radial component must vary continuously. If you split the lifted path into two halves, each winding once, they must cross each other when projected, leading to a self-intersection.\n\nI think the key idea is using the lifting to the universal cover and showing that two translates of the lifted path must intersect, implying a self-intersection in the original path. The rigorous way would involve setting up a function that compares two paths shifted by 2π and applying the intermediate value theorem to show they must cross. Here's a sketch:\n\nLet γ(t) = (θ(t), r(t)) be the lifted path in ℝ×[0,1], with θ(0)=0, θ(1)=4π, r(0)=r(1). Define another path γ'(t) = (θ(t) - 2π, r(t)). This path starts at (-2π, r0) and ends at (2π, r0). Now, consider the difference in the angular coordinate between γ and γ': θ(t) - (θ(s) - 2π). If for some t and s, θ(t) = θ(s) - 2π and r(t) = r(s), then γ(t) and γ'(s) project to the same point in the annulus, hence a self-intersection. To find such t and s, define a function F(t, s) = θ(t) - θ(s) + 2π. We need F(t, s)=0 and r(t)=r(s). \n\nConsider the line s = t. Then F(t, t) = θ(t) - θ(t) + 2π = 2π > 0. On the other hand, if s=0 and t=1, F(1,0) = θ(1) - θ(0) + 2π = 4π - 0 + 2π = 6π >0. Wait, maybe another approach. Let's fix s and vary t. For each s, consider the function F_s(t) = θ(t) - θ(s) + 2π. We want F_s(t) =0. As t varies from 0 to 1, θ(t) goes from 0 to 4π. For a fixed s, θ(s) is some value between 0 and 4π. So F_s(t) ranges from -θ(s) + 2π to 4π - θ(s) + 2π. If for some t, F_s(t)=0, then θ(t) = θ(s) - 2π. If we can find s such that θ(s) - 2π is within the range of θ(t), which is 0 to 4π, then θ(s) must be between 2π and 6π. But θ(s) is between 0 and 4π, so θ(s) - 2π is between -2π and 2π. Since θ(t) is between 0 and 4π, the overlap is between 0 and 2π. So for s where θ(s) ≥ 2π, then θ(s) - 2π is in [0, 2π], which is covered by θ(t). Thus, for s such that θ(s) ≥ 2π, there exists t such that θ(t) = θ(s) - 2π. Then if r(t) = r(s), we have a self-intersection. \n\nNow, consider the function r(t) - r(s) where θ(t) = θ(s) - 2π. If we can show that for some s, r(s) = r(t), then we're done. Assume the path is non-self-intersecting, so r(t) ≠ r(s) whenever θ(t) = θ(s) - 2π. Define a continuous function on the set of s where θ(s) ≥ 2π (which occurs when s is in some interval [a,1]). For each such s, there's a unique t with θ(t) = θ(s) - 2π. Then define g(s) = r(s) - r(t). If g(s) is always positive or always negative, then the path is always above or below itself, which would contradict the continuity and closure of the path. For example, if g(s) >0 for all s, then r(s) > r(t) whenever θ(s) = θ(t) + 2π. But as s increases from a to 1, t increases from 0 to b (where θ(b) = θ(a) - 2π). This would create a contradiction because the radial component can't consistently be above or below without crossing. Hence, by the intermediate value theorem, there must be some s where g(s)=0, implying a self-intersection.\n\nThis seems like a plausible argument. It uses the intermediate value theorem on the radial component when aligning the angles shifted by 2π. Therefore, the key steps are lifting to the universal cover, considering shifted paths, and applying the intermediate value theorem to the radial difference. This avoids the Jordan curve theorem and relies on continuity and the covering space properties.\n\nFor the extra parts about smooth paths or the torus, similar arguments might apply. For a smooth path, maybe using transversality or differential calculus, but the core idea remains. For the torus, a path winding twice in one direction and not in the other would similarly require self-intersection by comparing lifts in the universal cover (the plane) and showing shifts must intersect.",
