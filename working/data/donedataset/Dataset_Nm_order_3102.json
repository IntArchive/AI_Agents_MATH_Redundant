    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the hypergeometric function ${_4 F_3} \\left(\\frac12, \\frac12, 1, 1; \\frac34, \\frac54, \\frac32; \\frac14 \\right)$ equals $\\frac14 \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}+\\log^2 (2+\\sqrt{3} ) \\right)$. They also provided an integral representation and transformed the original series into an integral involving inverse hyperbolic tangent.\n\nFirst, I need to verify the integral representation they mentioned. They stated that $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{t^{2n}}{(1+t)^{4n+2}}dt=\\frac{2}{(2n+1) \\binom{4n+2}{2n+1}}.$$ Let me check if this is correct. The integral resembles a Beta function. The Beta function is $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{t^{c-1}}{(1+t)^{a+b}}dt = B(a,b)$ when the integral converges. Let me make a substitution here. Let $t = x/(1-x)$, which is a common substitution for Beta functions. Then $dt = dx/(1-x)^2$, and when $t$ goes from 0 to ∞, $x$ goes from 0 to 1. The integral becomes $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{(x/(1-x))^{2n}}{(1 + x/(1-x))^{4n+2}} \\cdot \\frac{dx}{(1-x)^2}.$$ Simplifying the denominator: $(1 + x/(1-x)) = 1/(1 - x)$, so the denominator becomes $(1/(1 - x))^{4n+2}$. Therefore, the integral becomes $$\\int_0^1 x^{2n} (1 - x)^{4n+2 - 2n - 2} dx = \\int_0^1 x^{2n} (1 - x)^{2n} dx.$$ Which is the Beta function $B(2n+1, 2n+1)$. The Beta function $B(a,b) = \\frac{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}{\\Gamma(a+b)}$. So substituting in, we get $$\\frac{\\Gamma(2n+1)\\Gamma(2n+1)}{\\Gamma(4n+2)} = \\frac{(2n)!^2}{(4n+1)!}.$$ But the user's result is $\\frac{2}{(2n+1) \\binom{4n+2}{2n+1}}}$. Let's compute the binomial coefficient: $\\binom{4n+2}{2n+1} = \\frac{(4n+2)!}{(2n+1)! (2n+1)!}$. Therefore, their expression is $\\frac{2}{(2n+1) \\cdot \\frac{(4n+2)!}{(2n+1)!^2}}} = \\frac{2 (2n+1)!^2}{(2n+1) (4n+2)!)} = \\frac{2 (2n)!^2}{(4n+2)!/(2n+1))}$? Wait, maybe miscalculating. Let's see:\n\n$\\frac{2}{(2n+1) \\binom{4n+2}{2n+1}} = \\frac{2}{(2n+1)} \\cdot \\frac{(2n+1)! (2n+1)!}{(4n+2)!} = \\frac{2 (2n+1)!^2}{(2n+1) (4n+2)!)} = \\frac{2 (2n)!^2 (2n+1)^2}{(2n+1) (4n+2)!)} = \\frac{2 (2n)!^2 (2n+1)}{(4n+2)!)}.$\n\nComparing this with the Beta function result: the Beta function gives $\\frac{(2n)!^2}{(4n+1)!}$. However, $(4n+1)!$ vs $(4n+2)!$ in the user's expression. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, maybe I messed up the substitution. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal integral: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{t^{2n}}{(1+t)^{4n+2}}dt$. Let me use substitution $u = t/(1+t)$, so $t = u/(1 - u)$, $dt = du/(1 - u)^2$. When t=0, u=0; t=∞, u=1. Then the integral becomes:\n\n$\\int_0^1 \\left(\\frac{u}{1 - u}\\right)^{2n} \\cdot (1 + u/(1 - u))^{-(4n+2)} \\cdot \\frac{du}{(1 - u)^2}$.\n\nSimplify denominator: $(1 + u/(1 - u)) = 1/(1 - u)$, so raised to the power of -(4n+2) gives $(1 - u)^{4n+2}$.\n\nThus, integral becomes:\n\n$\\int_0^1 u^{2n} (1 - u)^{4n+2} \\cdot (1 - u)^{-2n} \\cdot (1 - u)^{-2} du$\n\nWait, let's compute exponents:\n\nFirst term: u^{2n}.\n\nSecond term: (1 - u)^{4n + 2} from the denominator.\n\nBut multiplied by (1 - u)^{-2} from dt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original integrand is t^{2n}/(1 + t)^{4n + 2} dt.\n\nAfter substitution t = u/(1 - u), so t^{2n} = (u/(1 - u))^{2n}, denominator (1 + t) = 1 + u/(1 - u) = 1/(1 - u). So denominator raised to (4n + 2) is (1/(1 - u))^{4n + 2} = (1 - u)^{-4n -2}.\n\nThus, the integrand becomes [u^{2n} (1 - u)^{-2n}] * (1 - u)^{4n + 2} * dt. Wait, dt is du/(1 - u)^2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n[u^{2n} (1 - u)^{-2n}] * (1 - u)^{4n + 2} * (1 - u)^{-2} du\n\nCombine exponents of (1 - u): (-2n) + (4n + 2) + (-2) = 2n.\n\nTherefore, integral becomes ∫ u^{2n} (1 - u)^{2n} du from 0 to 1, which is B(2n + 1, 2n + 1) = (2n)!^2 / (4n + 1)!.\n\nBut according to the user's result, it's 2 / [(2n + 1) * binomial(4n + 2, 2n + 1)].\n\nLet's compute binomial(4n + 2, 2n + 1) = (4n + 2)! / [(2n + 1)! (2n + 1)!].\n\nSo 2 / [(2n + 1) * binomial(...)] = 2 / [(2n + 1) * (4n + 2)! / ((2n + 1)!^2))] = 2 * (2n + 1)!^2 / [(2n + 1) * (4n + 2)!))] = 2 * (2n + 1)!^2 / [(2n + 1) * (4n + 2)!))] = 2 * (2n)!^2 * (2n + 1)^2 / [(2n + 1) * (4n + 2)!))] = 2 * (2n)!^2 * (2n + 1) / (4n + 2)!).\n\nCompare this with the Beta function result: (2n)!^2 / (4n + 1)!.\n\nSo unless 2*(2n + 1)/(4n + 2)! ) = 1/(4n + 1)! ), but 4n + 2)! = (4n + 2)(4n + 1)!.\n\nTherefore, 2*(2n + 1)/( (4n + 2)(4n + 1)! )) = 2*(2n + 1)/( (2*(2n + 1))(4n + 1)! )) = 1/(4n + 1)!.\n\nTherefore, 2 * (2n)!^2 * (2n + 1) / (4n + 2)! ) = (2n)!^2 / (4n + 1)! ), which matches the Beta function result. Therefore, the user's integral expression is correct. So the integral step is valid.\n\nThen, substituting into S, the user gets S = ∫₀^∞ dt/(1 + t)^2 Σ [ (2t)^{2n} / ( (2n + 1)(1 + t)^{4n} ) ].\n\nSimplifying the sum inside: Σ [ ( (4t²)/(1 + t)^4 )^n / (2n + 1) ].\n\nThis sum resembles the expansion of a logarithm or inverse hyperbolic tangent. Recall that Σ_{n=0}^∞ x^{2n}/(2n + 1) = (1/(2x)) log( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ) for |x| < 1. Alternatively, it's the same as (tanh^{-1} x)/x.\n\nWait, let's recall the series for tanh^{-1} x: Σ_{n=0}^∞ x^{2n + 1}/(2n + 1) ) = tanh^{-1} x for |x| < 1. So dividing by x gives Σ_{n=0}^∞ x^{2n}/(2n + 1) ) = tanh^{-1} x / x.\n\nTherefore, in this case, x^2 = (4t²)/(1 + t)^4, so x = 2t/(1 + t)^2. Then, the sum becomes tanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 ) / (2t/(1 + t)^2 ).\n\nTherefore, S = ∫₀^∞ [dt/(1 + t)^2] * [ (1 + t)^2/(2t) ) * tanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 ) ]\n\nSimplifying: S = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ [dt/t] * tanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 )\n\nWhich matches the user's expression. So that step is correct.\n\nNow, the integral to evaluate is (1/2) ∫₀^∞ (1/t) tanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 ) dt.\n\nThe user is stuck here. How to proceed?\n\nFirst, let's analyze the argument of tanh^{-1}: 2t/(1 + t)^2. Let me check the domain. For t > 0, 2t/(1 + t)^2. The maximum of this function occurs at t=1, where 2*1/(4) = 0.5. So the argument is always less than 1 for t > 0. Hence, tanh^{-1} is valid here (since the argument is less than 1 in absolute value).\n\nNow, to compute the integral: 1/2 ∫₀^∞ [tanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 ) ] / t dt.\n\nPerhaps a substitution would help. Let me set u = t/(1 + t)^2. But not sure. Alternatively, set t = tanθ or something trigonometric?\n\nAlternatively, note that 2t/(1 + t)^2 can be rewritten. Let me compute 1 + t^2 + 2t = (1 + t)^2, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, express 2t/(1 + t)^2 as a function that can be simplified.\n\nLet me let x = 2t/(1 + t)^2. Solving for t, x(1 + t)^2 = 2t → x(t² + 2t + 1) = 2t → x t² + 2x t + x - 2t = 0 → x t² + (2x - 2) t + x = 0.\n\nThis quadratic in t can be solved, but perhaps not useful here.\n\nAlternatively, consider substitution t = (1 - u)/(1 + u) or some reciprocal substitution.\n\nAlternatively, note that 2t/(1 + t)^2 is symmetric in t and 1/t. Let me check:\n\nIf we substitute t → 1/t, then 2*(1/t)/(1 + 1/t)^2 = 2/(t ( (t + 1)/t )^2 ) = 2/(t) * t^2/(t + 1)^2 ) = 2t/(t + 1)^2. Which is the same as original. So the argument of tanh^{-1} is invariant under t → 1/t. Therefore, the integrand might have some symmetry.\n\nIndeed, if we split the integral from 0 to 1 and 1 to ∞, then substituting t = 1/u in the second integral:\n\nIntegral from 1 to ∞ [tanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 ) ] / t dt = Integral from 0 to 1 [tanh^{-1}(2/(1 + u)^2 * u ) ] / (1/u) * (-du/u²).\n\nWait, let's do substitution t = 1/u, so dt = -du/u². Then, when t=1, u=1; t=∞, u=0. So integral becomes ∫₀¹ [tanh^{-1}(2*(1/u)/(1 + 1/u)^2 ) ] / (1/u) * (du/u²).\n\nSimplify the argument: 2*(1/u)/( (1 + 1/u)^2 ) = 2/(u ( (u + 1)/u )^2 ) = 2/(u) * u²/(u + 1)^2 = 2u/(u + 1)^2. So same as original.\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ [tanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) ] * u / (1/u) * (du/u²) ?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up substitution steps. Let me do it carefully:\n\nOriginal integral after substitution t = 1/u:\n\n∫_{t=1}^{t=∞} [tanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 ) ] / t dt = ∫_{u=1}^{u=0} [tanh^{-1}(2*(1/u)/(1 + 1/u)^2 ) ] / (1/u) * (-du/u²)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= ∫_{u=0}^{u=1} [tanh^{-1}(2*(1/u)/( ( (u + 1)/u )^2 ) ) ] * u * (du/u²)\n\n= ∫₀¹ [tanh^{-1}(2*(1/u) * u²/(u + 1)^2 ) ] * u / u² du\n\n= ∫₀¹ [tanh^{-1}(2u/(u + 1)^2 ) ] * (1/u) du\n\nBut note that the argument is same as original, so tanh^{-1}(2u/(u + 1)^2 ) is same as in the original integral. Hence, the integral from 1 to ∞ is equal to the integral from 0 to 1 of [tanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) ] / u du.\n\nTherefore, the entire integral from 0 to ∞ is equal to 2 times the integral from 0 to 1 of [tanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) ] / u du.\n\nThus, S = (1/2) * 2 ∫₀¹ [tanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) ] / u du = ∫₀¹ [tanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) ] / u du.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps, but perhaps changing variables to x = 2u/(1 + u)^2.\n\nAlternatively, note that tanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) can be simplified.\n\nLet me compute 2u/(1 + u)^2. Let me set u = tanhθ or something. Alternatively, note that 2u/(1 + u)^2 = ( (1 + u)^2 - (1 - u)^2 ) / (1 + u)^2 = 1 - ( (1 - u)^2 / (1 + u)^2 ). Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider substitution v = (1 - u)/(1 + u). Let me try that. Let v = (1 - u)/(1 + u), so u = (1 - v)/(1 + v), du = -2 dv/(1 + v)^2.\n\nWhen u=0, v=1; u=1, v=0.\n\nThen, 2u/(1 + u)^2 = 2*(1 - v)/(1 + v) / ( (1 + (1 - v)/(1 + v) )^2 )\n\nWait, denominator: (1 + u)^2 = (1 + (1 - v)/(1 + v))^2 = ( ( (1 + v) + (1 - v) ) / (1 + v) )^2 = (2 / (1 + v))^2 = 4/(1 + v)^2.\n\nThus, 2u/(1 + u)^2 = [2*(1 - v)/(1 + v)] / [4/(1 + v)^2)] = [2(1 - v)(1 + v)] / 4 = [2(1 - v^2)] /4 = (1 - v^2)/2.\n\nSo tanh^{-1}( (1 - v^2)/2 ). Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut let's see what tanh^{-1}( (1 - v^2)/2 ) is. Maybe express in terms of logarithms:\n\ntanh^{-1}(x) = (1/2) log( (1 + x)/(1 - x) )\n\nSo tanh^{-1}( (1 - v^2)/2 ) = (1/2) log( (1 + (1 - v^2)/2 ) / (1 - (1 - v^2)/2 ) )\n\nSimplify numerator inside log: (1 + (1 - v^2)/2 ) = (2 + 1 - v²)/2 = (3 - v²)/2\n\nDenominator: (1 - (1 - v²)/2 ) = (2 - 1 + v²)/2 = (1 + v²)/2\n\nThus, tanh^{-1}( (1 - v²)/2 ) = (1/2) log( (3 - v²)/(1 + v²) )\n\nBut not sure if this helps. Alternatively, maybe make substitution v = sqrt(3) tanθ or something.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the integral ∫ [tanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) ] / u du from 0 to 1.\n\nPerhaps integrating by parts. Let me set dv = du/u, so v = log u, and u = tanh^{-1}(...). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, differentiate under the integral sign. Let me define I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [tanh^{-1}(a t/(1 + t)^2 ) ] / t dt, and see if I can compute I(a) and then set a=2. But this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider expressing tanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 ) as an integral. Since tanh^{-1}(x) = ∫₀^x 1/(1 - y²) dy, so:\n\ntanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 ) = ∫₀^{2t/(1 + t)^2} dy/(1 - y²).\n\nThen, the integral becomes S = 1/2 ∫₀^∞ [1/t ∫₀^{2t/(1 + t)^2} dy/(1 - y²) ] dt.\n\nInterchange the order of integration:\n\nS = 1/2 ∫₀^{1/2} [ ∫_{t such that 2t/(1 + t)^2 ≥ y} (1/t) dt ] dy/(1 - y²).\n\nBut the maximum value of 2t/(1 + t)^2 is 1/2 at t=1. So y ranges from 0 to 1/2. Wait, but when y approaches 1/2, the upper limit. So perhaps the limit is y ∈ (0, 1/2). Wait, but when t approaches infinity, 2t/(1 + t)^2 approaches 0. So for each y between 0 and 1/2, we need to find t such that 2t/(1 + t)^2 ≥ y. Let's solve for t:\n\n2t/(1 + t)^2 ≥ y → 2t ≥ y(1 + 2t + t²) → y t² + (2y - 2) t + y ≤ 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality in t: y t² + 2(y - 1) t + y ≤ 0.\n\nThe quadratic equation y t² + 2(y - 1) t + y = 0 has solutions:\n\nt = [ -2(y - 1) ± sqrt{4(y - 1)^2 - 4y^2} ]/(2y)\n\nSimplify discriminant: 4(y² - 2y + 1) - 4y² = 4(-2y + 1). So sqrt becomes sqrt(4(1 - 2y)) = 2 sqrt(1 - 2y).\n\nThus, t = [2(1 - y) ± 2 sqrt(1 - 2y)]/(2y) = [ (1 - y) ± sqrt(1 - 2y) ] / y.\n\nSince t must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\nt = [ (1 - y) + sqrt(1 - 2y) ] / y.\n\nBut wait, for y ≤ 1/2, sqrt(1 - 2y) is real. So the roots are real when y ≤ 1/2. The quadratic opens upwards (coefficient of t² is y > 0), so the inequality y t² + 2(y - 1)t + y ≤ 0 is satisfied between the two roots. However, since t > 0, the relevant interval is between the two positive roots? Wait, but need to check.\n\nAlternatively, since the quadratic in t is y t² + 2(y - 1) t + y ≤ 0, and since the leading coefficient y > 0, the quadratic is ≤ 0 between its two roots. Therefore, t must be between the two roots. But we need to find t such that 2t/(1 + t)^2 ≥ y, which happens when t is between the two positive roots.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps changing variables to y = 2t/(1 + t)^2, but this might lead to a complicated expression.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to the original integral after substitution:\n\nS = ∫₀¹ [tanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) ] / u du.\n\nLet me make substitution x = 2u/(1 + u)^2. Then, solve for u in terms of x.\n\nAs before, x = 2u/(1 + u)^2 → x(1 + 2u + u²) = 2u → x u² + 2x u + x - 2u = 0 → x u² + (2x - 2) u + x = 0.\n\nThis quadratic in u has solutions:\n\nu = [2 - 2x ± sqrt{(2x - 2)^2 - 4x^2}]/(2x)\n\nCompute discriminant: (4x² - 8x + 4) - 4x² = -8x + 4.\n\nSo sqrt(-8x + 4) = sqrt(4 - 8x) = 2 sqrt(1 - 2x).\n\nThus, u = [2 - 2x ± 2 sqrt(1 - 2x)]/(2x) = [1 - x ± sqrt(1 - 2x)]/x.\n\nSince u > 0, we take the positive root:\n\nu = [1 - x + sqrt(1 - 2x)]/x.\n\nDifferentiating x with respect to u:\n\ndx/du = [2(1 + u)^2 - 2u*2(1 + u)]/(1 + u)^4 = [2(1 + u) - 4u]/(1 + u)^3 = [2 + 2u - 4u]/(1 + u)^3 = [2 - 2u]/(1 + u)^3 = 2(1 - u)/(1 + u)^3.\n\nThus, du = dx / [2(1 - u)/(1 + u)^3 ].\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider expanding tanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) into a series and integrating term by term.\n\nRecall that tanh^{-1}(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k + 1}/(2k + 1) for |z| < 1.\n\nHere, z = 2u/(1 + u)^2, which is less than 1 for u > 0, as we saw earlier (maximum 1/2 at u=1). So we can expand:\n\ntanh^{-1}(2u/(1 + u)^2 ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2u/(1 + u)^2 )^{2k + 1} ] / (2k + 1)\n\nThen, S = ∫₀¹ Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2u)^{2k + 1} / ( (1 + u)^{4k + 2} (2k + 1) ) ] / u du\n\n= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1) ] ∫₀¹ u^{2k} / (1 + u)^{4k + 2} du\n\nBut this seems to bring us back to the original integral expression. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that the original series S was expressed in terms of hypergeometric function. The user mentioned that it's equal to a combination of π² and log² terms. So perhaps there's a known hypergeometric identity that can be applied here.\n\nThe hypergeometric function given is ${_4 F_3} \\left(\\frac12, \\frac12, 1, 1; \\frac34, \\frac54, \\frac32; \\frac14 \\right)$. Looking up such hypergeometric functions and their closed forms might help. However, it's not a standard function, so likely requires transformation or connection to integrals or known constants.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the integral S is expressed as (1/2) ∫₀^∞ (1/t) tanh^{-1}(2t/(1 + t)^2 ) dt. Let's try to compute this integral.\n\nLet me make substitution t = tanθ, where θ ∈ (0, π/2). Then, dt = sec²θ dθ. However, when t approaches ∞, θ approaches π/2. Let's see:\n\nThe integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [1/tanθ] tanh^{-1}(2 tanθ/(1 + tanθ)^2 ) sec²θ dθ.\n\nBut this might not simplify things. Alternatively, note that 2 tanθ/(1 + tanθ)^2 = sin(2θ)/(1 + sin(2θ)) or something? Let's compute:\n\n1 + tanθ = (sinθ + cosθ)/cosθ, so (1 + tanθ)^2 = (sinθ + cosθ)^2 / cos²θ = (1 + 2 sinθ cosθ)/cos²θ = (1 + sin2θ)/cos²θ.\n\nThus, 2 tanθ/(1 + tanθ)^2 = 2 (sinθ/cosθ) * cos²θ/(1 + sin2θ) ) = 2 sinθ cosθ / (1 + sin2θ) = sin2θ / (1 + sin2θ).\n\nThus, tanh^{-1}(sin2θ/(1 + sin2θ)).\n\nLet me compute sin2θ/(1 + sin2θ). Let me set φ = 2θ. Then, sinφ/(1 + sinφ). The inverse hyperbolic tangent of that:\n\ntanh^{-1}(sinφ/(1 + sinφ)).\n\nWe can simplify this expression. Let me set x = sinφ/(1 + sinφ). Then, solving for sinφ:\n\nx(1 + sinφ) = sinφ → x + x sinφ = sinφ → x = sinφ (1 - x) → sinφ = x/(1 - x).\n\nThen, tanh^{-1}(x) = (1/2) log( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ). So tanh^{-1}(sinφ/(1 + sinφ)) = (1/2) log( (1 + sinφ/(1 + sinφ)) / (1 - sinφ/(1 + sinφ)) ) = (1/2) log( [ (1 + sinφ + sinφ ) / (1 + sinφ - sinφ) ] ) = (1/2) log( (1 + 2 sinφ ) / 1 ) = (1/2) log(1 + 2 sinφ).\n\nBut φ = 2θ, so tanh^{-1}(sin2θ/(1 + sin2θ)) = (1/2) log(1 + 2 sin2θ).\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\nS = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [ (1/2) log(1 + 2 sin2θ) / tanθ ] sec²θ dθ.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/4) ∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + 2 sin2θ) * [ sec²θ / tanθ ] dθ.\n\nBut sec²θ / tanθ = (1/cos²θ) / (sinθ/cosθ) ) = 1/(sinθ cosθ).\n\nThus, S = (1/4) ∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + 2 sin2θ) / (sinθ cosθ) dθ.\n\nLet me substitute φ = 2θ, so θ = φ/2, dθ = dφ/2. Limits from 0 to π.\n\nThen,\n\nS = (1/4) * (1/2) ∫₀^π log(1 + 2 sinφ) / (sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2)) dφ.\n\nNote that sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2) = (1/2) sinφ, so denominator is (1/2) sinφ. Therefore,\n\nS = (1/8) ∫₀^π log(1 + 2 sinφ) / ( (1/2) sinφ ) dφ = (1/4) ∫₀^π log(1 + 2 sinφ) / sinφ dφ.\n\nSo S = (1/4) ∫₀^π log(1 + 2 sinφ) / sinφ dφ.\n\nThis integral might be known or can be evaluated using known techniques. Let's consider expanding log(1 + 2 sinφ) into a Fourier series or using integration techniques.\n\nFirst, note that 1 + 2 sinφ = 1 + 2 sinφ. Let's see if this can be expressed in terms of products or exponentials.\n\nAlternatively, expand log(1 + 2 sinφ) into a power series. Since |2 sinφ| ≤ 2, which is larger than 1, so the usual expansion for log(1 + x) won't converge. However, perhaps integrating term by term.\n\nAlternatively, consider substitution z = e^{iφ}, so sinφ = (z - z^{-1})/(2i). Then, the integral becomes a contour integral around the unit circle. But this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, recall that ∫₀^π log(1 + 2 sinφ) dφ can be related to known integrals. Wait, but we have an integral of log(1 + 2 sinφ)/sinφ.\n\nLet me make substitution t = φ. The integral is from 0 to π of log(1 + 2 sin t)/sin t dt. Let's split the integral into two parts: from 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. In the second interval, substitute t = π - u.\n\nFor t in (π/2, π), sin t = sin(π - u) = sin u. So the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + 2 sin t)/sin t dt + ∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + 2 sin u)/sin u du = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + 2 sin t)/sin t dt.\n\nThus, S = (1/4) * 2 ∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + 2 sin t)/sin t dt = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + 2 sin t)/sin t dt.\n\nLet me focus on evaluating ∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + 2 sin t)/sin t dt.\n\nLet me make substitution x = sin t, so t = arcsin x, dt = dx/√(1 - x²). The limits go from x=0 to x=1.\n\nThen, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ log(1 + 2x)/x * dx/√(1 - x²).\n\nHmm, this still looks difficult. Perhaps expanding log(1 + 2x) into a power series.\n\nWe can write log(1 + 2x) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k+1} (2x)^k / k for |2x| < 1 → x < 1/2. But our integral goes up to x=1, so this expansion won't converge there. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use integral representation of log(1 + 2x):\n\nlog(1 + 2x) = ∫₀^{2x} 1/(1 + y) dy = ∫₀² 1/(1 + y) dy for x ≤1.\n\nBut maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider differentiation under the integral sign. Let me define I(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + a sin t)/sin t dt. Then, dI/da = ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + a sin t) dt.\n\nCompute dI/da = ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + a sin t) dt. This integral is known.\n\nThe integral ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + a sin t) dt can be evaluated using substitution u = tan(t/2), leading to:\n\nLet u = tan(t/2), so sin t = 2u/(1 + u²), dt = 2 du/(1 + u²). Limits from u=0 to u=1.\n\nThus,\n\n∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + a sin t) dt = ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + a * 2u/(1 + u²)) * 2 du/(1 + u²)\n\n= 2 ∫₀¹ (1 + u²)/[ (1 + u²) + 2a u ] * du/(1 + u²)\n\n= 2 ∫₀¹ du/[ (1 + u²) + 2a u ]\n\n= 2 ∫₀¹ du/(u² + 2a u + 1 )\n\nComplete the square in the denominator: u² + 2a u +1 = (u + a)^2 + (1 - a²).\n\nThe integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ du/[(u + a)^2 + (1 - a²)].\n\nAssuming 1 - a² > 0 → |a| < 1. But in our case, a=2, which is problematic. Wait, but in our problem, we have a=2, so 1 - a² = -3 < 0, so the denominator is (u + a)^2 - 3. Which can be factored as (u + a - sqrt(3))(u + a + sqrt(3)). But then the integral becomes:\n\n2 ∫₀¹ du/( (u + a)^2 - 3 ) = 2/(2 sqrt(3)) ) [ log | (u + a - sqrt(3))/(u + a + sqrt(3)) | ] from 0 to1.\n\nBut this is valid when the denominator is not zero. However, since we have a=2, let's compute:\n\n∫₀¹ du/( (u + 2)^2 - 3 ) = ∫₀¹ du/(u² + 4u + 1 )\n\nThe denominator factors as u² + 4u + 1 = (u + 2)^2 - 3, which is as before. So the integral is:\n\n(1/(2 sqrt(3))) [ log( (u + 2 - sqrt(3))/(u + 2 + sqrt(3)) ) ] from 0 to1.\n\nEvaluated at 1:\n\n(1/(2 sqrt(3))) log( (3 - sqrt(3))/(3 + sqrt(3)) ).\n\nAt 0:\n\n(1/(2 sqrt(3))) log( (2 - sqrt(3))/(2 + sqrt(3)) ).\n\nThus, the integral is:\n\n(1/(2 sqrt(3))) [ log( (3 - sqrt(3))/(3 + sqrt(3)) ) - log( (2 - sqrt(3))/(2 + sqrt(3)) ) ].\n\nSimplify the logs:\n\n= (1/(2 sqrt(3))) log( [ (3 - sqrt(3))/(3 + sqrt(3)) * (2 + sqrt(3))/(2 - sqrt(3)) ] ).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nFirst term: (3 - sqrt(3))/(3 + sqrt(3)) = [ (3 - sqrt(3))^2 ] / (9 - 3 ) = (9 -6 sqrt(3) + 3)/6 = (12 -6 sqrt(3))/6 = 2 - sqrt(3).\n\nSimilarly, (2 + sqrt(3))/(2 - sqrt(3)) = [ (2 + sqrt(3))^2 ] / (4 - 3 ) = (4 +4 sqrt(3) +3)/1 =7 +4 sqrt(3).\n\nBut wait, let's compute the argument:\n\n(3 - sqrt(3))/(3 + sqrt(3)) * (2 + sqrt(3))/(2 - sqrt(3)) = [ (3 - sqrt(3))(2 + sqrt(3)) ] / [ (3 + sqrt(3))(2 - sqrt(3)) ].\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 3*2 + 3*sqrt(3) - 2 sqrt(3) - (sqrt(3))^2 =6 +3 sqrt(3) -2 sqrt(3) -3=3 + sqrt(3).\n\nDenominator:3*2 -3 sqrt(3) +2 sqrt(3) - (sqrt(3))^2 =6 -3 sqrt(3)+2 sqrt(3)-3=3 - sqrt(3).\n\nThus, the argument is (3 + sqrt(3))/(3 - sqrt(3)) = [ (3 + sqrt(3))^2 ] / (9 -3 )= (9 +6 sqrt(3) +3)/6= (12 +6 sqrt(3))/6=2 + sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore, the integral is:\n\n(1/(2 sqrt(3))) log(2 + sqrt(3)) ).\n\nThus, dI/da at a=2 is (1/(2 sqrt(3))) log(2 + sqrt(3)) ).\n\nWait, but we were considering a=2. However, our original differentiation under the integral sign was for I(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} log(1 + a sin t)/sin t dt, and we computed dI/da = ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + a sin t) dt, which for a=2, we just found is (1/(2 sqrt(3))) log(2 + sqrt(3)) ).\n\nBut I(a) is the integral we need. Since we have dI/da = (1/(2 sqrt(3))) log(2 + sqrt(3)) ), then integrating from a=0 to a=2:\n\nI(2) - I(0) = ∫₀² dI/da da = ∫₀² (1/(2 sqrt(3))) log(2 + sqrt(3)) ) da. Wait, but this can't be right because dI/da is a function of a. Wait, no. Wait, the problem arises because when we differentiated I(a) with respect to a, we obtained dI/da = ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + a sin t) dt, which for general a, but when a=2, the integral is as computed. However, we need to express I(a) as the integral from 0 to a of dI/da da.\n\nBut to compute I(2), we need to integrate dI/da from a=0 to a=2. However, the expression for dI/da is different depending on the value of a. For |a| <1, we could compute it using standard methods, but for a=2, it's outside that range. Therefore, this approach might not work directly.\n\nAlternatively, consider a substitution that can handle a >1.\n\nAlternatively, note that the original problem relates to the sum S which the user expressed as a hypergeometric function. Perhaps connecting this to known values of hypergeometric functions involving π² and log terms.\n\nThe closed-form result includes π²/4 and log²(2 + sqrt(3)). The term log(2 + sqrt(3)) is related to inverse hyperbolic functions. Specifically, log(2 + sqrt(3)) = 2 artanh( sqrt(3)/2 ), but artanh(sqrt(3)/2) is complex. Alternatively, log(2 + sqrt(3)) = arcsinh( sqrt(3)/2 ), but not sure. Alternatively, note that 2 + sqrt(3) is the cotangent of π/12, but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, recall that log(2 + sqrt(3)) is the value of the integral ∫₀^{π/3} sec t dt, which is the inverse hyperbolic function, but not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the closed-form expression involves both π² and log squared terms, suggesting that the integral might decompose into two parts: one involving a trigonometric integral leading to π², and another involving a logarithmic integral leading to log squared.\n\nAlternatively, note that the integral S can be split into two parts using the identity tanh^{-1}(z) = (1/2) log((1 + z)/(1 - z)). Then:\n\nS = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ (1/t) * (1/2) log( (1 + 2t/(1 + t)^2 ) / (1 - 2t/(1 + t)^2 )) dt\n\n= (1/4) ∫₀^∞ [ log( ( (1 + t)^2 + 2t ) / ( (1 + t)^2 - 2t ) ) ] / t dt\n\nSimplify the arguments:\n\nNumerator: (1 + t)^2 + 2t =1 + 2t + t² + 2t =1 +4t +t²= (t + 2)^2 -3\n\nDenominator: (1 + t)^2 -2t =1 +2t +t² -2t =1 + t²\n\nThus,\n\nS = (1/4) ∫₀^∞ [ log( ( (t + 2)^2 -3 ) / (1 + t²) ) ] / t dt\n\n= (1/4) [ ∫₀^∞ log( (t + 2)^2 -3 ) / t dt - ∫₀^∞ log(1 + t²) / t dt ]\n\nBut both integrals individually diverge. For example, as t→0, log(1 + t²) ~ t², so integrand ~ t²/t = t, which is okay. But as t→∞, log( (t + 2)^2 -3 ) ~ log(t²), so integrand ~ log(t²)/t ~ 2 log t / t, which is integrable. Similarly for log(1 + t²) ~ 2 log t, integrable. However, the individual integrals might still diverge due to behavior at intermediate points. But perhaps their difference converges.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the original integral S converges, so the difference between the two divergent integrals must converge. This suggests that we need to regularize the integrals.\n\nAlternatively, use Frullani's integral, which states that ∫₀^∞ (f(ax) - f(bx))/x dx = (f(0) - f(∞)) log(b/a). But our integral involves log terms. Let's see if we can express the integral in terms of Frullani's integral.\n\nLet me consider ∫₀^∞ [ log(A + Bt) - log(C + Dt) ] / t dt. This can be written as ∫₀^∞ log( (A + Bt)/(C + Dt) ) / t dt. If we can express the argument as a ratio of linear functions, Frullani's theorem might apply. However, in our case, the argument is ((t + 2)^2 -3)/(1 + t²) = (t² +4t +4 -3)/(1 + t²) = (t² +4t +1)/(1 + t²). Not a linear function, so Frullani might not help.\n\nAlternatively, write (t² +4t +1)/(1 + t²) =1 +4t/(1 + t²). So log(...) = log(1 +4t/(1 + t²)). Then expand into power series:\n\nlog(1 +4t/(1 + t²)) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k+1} (4t)^k / [k (1 + t²)^k ]\n\nBut integrating term by term would give:\n\nΣ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k+1} 4^k /k ∫₀^∞ t^{k -1}/(1 + t²)^k dt\n\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ t^{k -1}/(1 + t²)^k dt can be evaluated using substitution u = t², yielding Beta function:\n\n= (1/2) ∫₀^∞ u^{(k -1)/2}/(1 + u)^k du = (1/2) B( (k +1)/2, (k -1)/2 )\n\nBut B(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b). For a = (k +1)/2 and b = (k -1)/2, Γ(a)Γ(b) = π / sin(π a) by Euler's reflection formula. Since a + b = k, Γ(k) = (k -1)!.\n\nBut for a = (k +1)/2 and b = (k -1)/2, sin(π a) = sin( π (k +1)/2 ). For k odd and even:\n\nIf k is odd, say k = 2m +1, then a = m +1, b = m, so Γ(a)Γ(b) = Γ(m +1)Γ(m) = m! (m -1)! ) and Γ(a + b) = Γ(2m +1) = (2m)! ). So B(a,b) = m! (m -1)! / (2m)! ) = 1/(2m * binomial(2m, m)) ).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is π/(2^{2m} (m)) for k=2m+1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that for k=1, ∫₀^∞ t^{0}/(1 + t²) dt = π/2. For k=2, ∫₀^∞ t/(1 + t²)^2 dt = 1/2. For k=3, ∫₀^∞ t²/(1 + t²)^3 dt = π/16 * 4? Not sure.\n\nBut this approach seems to lead to a complicated series. Maybe not the best path.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not seeing a clear path, perhaps I should recall that the user mentioned the integral relates to the hypergeometric function and the closed-form involves π² and log² terms. Perhaps there's a connection to elliptic integrals or polylogarithms.\n\nAlternatively, note that the closed-form expression is (1/4)(π²/4 + log²(2 + sqrt(3)) ). The π² term suggests a connection to the integral of log terms over an interval, possibly involving trigonometric integrals. The log squared term might come from squaring a log integral.\n\nAlternatively, consider that log(2 + sqrt(3)) is equal to arcsinh(1), since sinh(arcsinh(1))=1, and sinh(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2. Let me solve for x where sinh(x) =1: e^x - e^{-x} =2 → e^{2x} -2 e^x -1=0 → e^x = [2 ± sqrt(4 +4)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(8)]/2 =1 ± sqrt(2). Taking positive solution: e^x=1 + sqrt(2)→x=log(1 + sqrt(2)). But 1 + sqrt(2)) is approximately 2.414, while 2 + sqrt(3)) is approximately 3.732. Not the same. Wait, but log(2 + sqrt(3)) = log(1 + sqrt(3)) + log( (2 + sqrt(3))/(1 + sqrt(3)) ). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 2 + sqrt(3)) = sec(π/6) + tan(π/6), but sec(π/6)=2/sqrt(3), tan(π/6)=1/sqrt(3), so sum is sqrt(3). No. Alternatively, 2 + sqrt(3)=cot(π/12). Because cot(π/12)= (cos(π/12)/sin(π/12))= (sqrt(6)+sqrt(2))/ (sqrt(6)-sqrt(2)) )= (sqrt(6)+sqrt(2))^2/ (6 -2)= (6 +2 + 2*sqrt(12))/4= (8 +4*sqrt(3))/4=2 + sqrt(3). Yes! So cot(π/12)=2 + sqrt(3), so log(2 + sqrt(3))=log(cot(π/12)).\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe connecting the integral to a known result involving π/12.\n\nAlternatively, note that the integral S involves integrating log(1 + 2 sinφ) over a interval, which might relate to known integrals in trigonometry. For example, there's an integral formula for ∫₀^{π} log(1 + b sinφ) dφ, which can be expressed in terms of π and arcsin terms. But our integral has log(1 + 2 sinφ)/sinφ, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the integral ∫ log(1 + a sinφ) dφ can be expressed using series expansion, leading to terms involving π² when squared. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps it's best to look for resources or papers that relate hypergeometric functions to such integrals. Alternatively, the user's integral S is equal to the hypergeometric function, which has parameters {1/2, 1/2, 1, 1} and {3/4, 5/4, 3/2} with argument 1/4. This specific combination might be reducible to known constants.\n\nUpon searching, I find that hypergeometric functions can sometimes be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals or logarithms. For example, certain 4F3 functions can be related to combinations of squares of logarithms or products of π and log terms. The presence of π² suggests that the integral might split into two parts, each involving π and log terms, which when squared and summed, give the desired result.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral S can be expressed as a sum of two integrals: one leading to π² and the other to log²(2 + sqrt(3)). For example, if we can express S as (π²/16) + (1/4) log²(2 + sqrt(3)), then multiplying by 1/4 gives the desired result.\n\nBut how to split the integral? The original expression S is given as 1/4 of the sum of π²/4 and log²(...). So perhaps the integral splits into two parts, each contributing one of the terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral involving tanh^{-1} can be related to both a trigonometric integral (giving π²) and a logarithmic integral (giving log squared).\n\nGiven the time I've invested and not seeing a clear path, I think the key steps involve recognizing the hypergeometric function identity, using integral transformations, and possibly leveraging known results involving logarithmic integrals and their relation to hypergeometric functions. The closed-form result likely combines contributions from different parts of the integral evaluation, resulting in both π² and log² terms.",
