    "AcceptedAnswer": "$$\\log{k+1\\over k}=\\int_k^{k+1}{dx\\over x}<{1\\over k}<\\int_{k-1}^k{dx\\over x}=\\log{k\\over k-1}\\qquad(k>1)\\ .$$\nSumming over $k$ produces telescoping series on the left hand and the right hand side. Doing the computations one finds\n$$\\log{3002\\over1001}<S<\\log{3001\\over 1000}\\ .$$\nHere the left hand side is obviously $>1$. For the right hand side we note that\n$$e^{4\\over3}>1+{4\\over3}+{(4/3)^2\\over2}={29\\over9}>{3001\\over1000}\\ ,$$ and this shows that\n$$\\log{3001\\over 1000}<{4\\over3}\\ .$$ Update: The OP has desired a calculus-free approach. For the upper estimate one could argue as follows: Using the splitting\n$$S=\\sum_{k=1001}^{1350}{1\\over k}+\\sum_{k=1351}^{1800}{1\\over k}+\\sum_{k=1801}^{2400}{1\\over k}+\\sum_{k=2401}^{3000}{1\\over k}+{1\\over3001}$$\none obtains \n$$S<{350\\over1000}+{450\\over1350}+{600\\over1800}+{600\\over2400}+{1\\over3001}={76\\over60}+{1\\over3001}<{4\\over3}\\ .$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to prove that the sum from 1/1001 to 1/3001 is strictly between 1 and 4/3. They've already worked on the left inequality using some sort of pairing and AM-HM, getting that it's greater than 1. Now they need the upper bound of less than 4/3.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about the sum S = 1/1001 + 1/1002 + ... + 1/3001. The assumptions here would be the range of the summation: starting at 1001, ending at 3001, each term is 1/n where n is an integer in that range. The problem is to show that 1 < S < 4/3. The user mentions they have a solution for the lower bound but need help with the upper, preferably without calculus. \n\nSo, the assumptions are each term is 1/k where k ranges from 1001 to 3001 inclusive. The problem is to prove the inequality. The original problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions on methods, but the user prefers non-calculus solutions. However, in the formatted problem, we just need to state the problem and assumptions without including method preferences unless specified. The example given didn't include method preferences in the formatted problem, so I should follow that.\n\nWait, the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, that wasn't stated. Wait, looking back, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the example is different. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe that example is incorrect. Wait, but the user provided that as their own example. So maybe the user intended to show that in the formatted problem, assumptions are listed even if they weren't explicit in the original problem. Wait, but in the original problem, it's stated for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example is a different problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe the key is that when structuring the problem, the assistant should list all the assumptions, even those that might be implicit. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n...\", so the assumption would be that n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's conflicting. Unless there's a typo in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different divisibility condition. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a different setup. Maybe there was a miscommunication in the example. But regardless, perhaps the user intended that in the formatted problem, all relevant assumptions (including those implicit in the problem statement) should be listed line by line. \n\nBut in the given problem here, the problem is to prove 1 < sum from 1001 to 3001 of 1/k < 4/3. The assumptions would be that the sum is from k=1001 to k=3001, each term is 1/k, and the problem is to prove the inequalities. But the original problem doesn't have any additional conditions; the sum is straightforward. So the assumptions would just be the terms of the sum, right? So each term is 1/k where k ranges from 1001 to 3001 inclusive, and the sum is over those terms. Wait, but how to list that line by line? Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum S is defined as the sum from k=1001 to k=3001 of 1/k.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer between 1001 and 3001 inclusive,\nEach term in the sum is 1/k.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's key components are the bounds of the sum. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem's assumption was that n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7, even though the problem statement was \"for every integer n\". That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to filter out the necessary assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the example is not a good one. But in any case, for the current problem, the sum is from 1001 to 3001. So the assumptions would be that the sum is over integers k from 1001 to 3001, each term is 1/k. The problem is to show that the sum is between 1 and 4/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an assumption that each term is positive, but that's obvious. But according to the example, perhaps the user wants to list all possible assumptions. But maybe in this case, the key assumptions are the range of k. So:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer,\n1001 ≤ k ≤ 3001,\nThe sum S is the sum of 1/k for all integers k from 1001 to 3001.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer,\nEach term in the sum is of the form 1/k,\nThe sum S includes all terms from k=1001 to k=3001.\n\nBut maybe the user wants it structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum S is defined as S = 1/1001 + 1/1002 + ... + 1/3001,\nEach term 1/k is positive.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the inequality 1 < S < 4/3. So perhaps the necessary assumptions are that S is the sum of reciprocals of consecutive integers from 1001 to 3001. So breaking that into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum S is composed of terms 1/k where k is an integer,\nEach k satisfies 1001 ≤ k ≤ 3001,\nThe sum includes all integers k from 1001 to 3001 inclusive.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So in this problem, the assumptions would be similar: each term is 1/k, k ranges from 1001 to 3001, k is integer, and perhaps the sum is over consecutive integers. However, the original problem doesn't specify if there are gaps, but since it's written as 1/1001 + 1/1002 + ... + 1/3001, it's assumed consecutive. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer,\nEach term in S is 1/k,\nThe terms in S correspond to k from 1001 to 3001 inclusive,\nThe terms are added consecutively without omission.\n\nBut perhaps the user would prefer more concise assumptions. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer between 1001 and 3001 inclusive,\nThe sum S is the sum of 1/k for all integers k in [1001, 3001].\n\nBut according to the example's format, each assumption should be a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer,\n1001 ≤ k ≤ 3001,\nThe sum S is the sum of 1/k for all k in [1001, 3001].\n\nThat should cover it. The problem is to prove that 1 < S < 4/3. So the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nk is an integer,\n1001 ≤ k ≤ 3001,\nThe sum S is the sum of 1/k for all integers k between 1001 and 3001 inclusive.\nProblem: \nProve that $$1 < \\dfrac{1}{1001}+\\dfrac{1}{1002}+\\dfrac{1}{1003}+\\dots+\\dfrac{1}{3001} < \\dfrac{4}{3} \\, .$$",
