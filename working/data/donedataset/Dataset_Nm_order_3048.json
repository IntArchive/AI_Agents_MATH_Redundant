    "Content": "Let $I$ and $J$ be ideals of a Noetherian ring $A$. If $JA_P\\subseteq IA_P$ for every $P\\in \\operatorname{Ass}_A(A/I)$, then $J\\subseteq I$. I'm reading Matsumura's Commutative Ring Theory book on my own. This is exercise $6.4$ in that book, and I fail to prove it. Could you help me with this? Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The problem reduces easily to the following: Let $R$ be a noetherian ring and $\\mathfrak a$ an ideal of $R$ such that $\\mathfrak aR_{\\mathfrak p}=0$ for all $\\mathfrak p\\in\\operatorname{Ass}R$. Prove that $\\mathfrak a=0$. Since $R$ is noetherian there exists a (reduced) primary decomposition $0=\\mathfrak q_1\\cap\\cdots\\cap\\mathfrak q_t$. It follows that $\\operatorname{Ass}R=\\{\\mathfrak p_1,\\dots,\\mathfrak p_t\\}$, where $\\mathfrak p_i=\\sqrt{\\mathfrak q_i}$. Now take $a\\in\\mathfrak a$, $a\\neq 0$. There exists $\\mathfrak q_i$ such that $a\\notin\\mathfrak q_i$. Then the ideal $(\\mathfrak q_i:a)$ is $\\mathfrak p_i$-primary, in particular $\\sqrt{(\\mathfrak q_i:a)}=\\mathfrak p_i$. Now localize this equality at $\\mathfrak p_i$ and obtain $\\sqrt{(\\mathfrak q_iR_{\\mathfrak p_i}:aR_{\\mathfrak p_i})}=\\mathfrak p_iR_{\\mathfrak p_i}$. But $aR_{\\mathfrak p_i}=0$ and thus $(\\mathfrak q_iR_{\\mathfrak p_i}:aR_{\\mathfrak p_i})=R_{\\mathfrak p_i},$ a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem from Matsumura's Commutative Ring Theory. The problem states that if I and J are ideals in a Noetherian ring A, and if for every associated prime P of A/I, the localization of J at P is contained in the localization of I at P, then J should be contained in I. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall some concepts. Associated primes of a module, in this case A/I, are the prime ideals that appear as annihilators of elements in A/I. So, Ass_A(A/I) consists of primes P such that P = Ann(a + I) for some a in A. Since A is Noetherian, A/I is also Noetherian, so the set of associated primes is finite.\n\nThe condition given is that for each P in Ass_A(A/I), when we localize at P, the ideal J localized at P is contained in I localized at P. That is, J_A_P ⊆ I_A_P. Localization here probably means that when we invert elements not in P, the image of J in the localized ring is contained in the image of I.\n\nThe goal is to show that J itself is contained in I. So, even though the containment happens at each localization at these associated primes, we need to globalize that information.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe using the fact that in a Noetherian ring, the set of associated primes of A/I is the set of primes minimal over I, or something related? Wait, no, associated primes can be embedded or minimal. But maybe the key is that the associated primes are the primes where I has primary components.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that if an element is in J and not in I, then there's some associated prime where its image is non-zero, leading to a contradiction. Wait, but how?\n\nAnother idea: since A is Noetherian, the ideal I has a primary decomposition. Each associated prime corresponds to a primary component. If J is contained in each P-primary component of I, then maybe J is contained in I? Hmm, but the condition here is about localizations. So maybe we need to relate the containment in localizations to containment in primary components.\n\nWait, if J_A_P is contained in I_A_P for each associated prime P, then perhaps for each x in J, when we localize at P, x/1 is in I_A_P. So, this means that for each x in J and each P in Ass_A(A/I), there exists some s not in P such that s x ∈ I. \n\nBut how to go from here? If we have such s for each P, maybe we can find a single s not in any P such that s x ∈ I. But the problem is that the associated primes might not cover all the primes, so s would have to be outside the union of associated primes. However, in a Noetherian ring, the union of associated primes is the set of zero divisors, right? So if x is not a zero divisor, maybe s can be 1. Wait, but x is in J, which might not be related to zero divisors.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if x ∈ J but x ∉ I, then the element x + I is non-zero in A/I. Since A/I is Noetherian, it has associated primes, and the annihilator of x + I would be some prime P in Ass_A(A/I). Then, in the localization at P, x/1 would be in J_A_P ⊆ I_A_P, implying that x/1 ∈ I_A_P. Therefore, there exists some s ∉ P such that s x ∈ I. But the annihilator of x + I is P, which means that if s x ∈ I, then s ∈ Ann(x + I) = P. But s ∉ P by construction. That's a contradiction. Therefore, x must be in I. \n\nWait, let me check this again. Suppose x ∈ J \\ I. Then x + I is non-zero in A/I. Since A/I is Noetherian, the set of associated primes Ass_A(A/I) is non-empty. So there exists a prime P ∈ Ass_A(A/I) such that P is the annihilator of some element y + I in A/I. But how does x relate to this? Wait, maybe x + I has annihilator contained in P? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps since x is not in I, we can look at the module A/I and the element x + I. The annihilator of x + I is {a ∈ A | a x ∈ I}. If x ∉ I, this annihilator is an ideal. Since A is Noetherian, this annihilator has some associated primes. But maybe the primes associated to A/I are exactly the primes that annihilate some element of A/I. So if x + I ≠ 0, then the annihilator of x + I is contained in some associated prime of A/I. Wait, not necessarily. Wait, in a Noetherian module, every prime ideal that is minimal over the annihilator of an element is an associated prime. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since P is an associated prime of A/I, there exists an element y + I in A/I such that P = Ann(y + I). If x is in J, then by the given condition, x/1 ∈ J_A_P ⊆ I_A_P. So, there exists s ∉ P such that s x ∈ I. But then s is in Ann(y + I) = P, which contradicts s ∉ P. Therefore, no such x exists, so J ⊆ I. \n\nWait, let me clarify this argument. Suppose x ∈ J \\ I. Then x + I ≠ 0 in A/I. Let’s consider the annihilator of x + I, which is {a ∈ A | a x ∈ I}. Since A is Noetherian, this annihilator ideal has a primary decomposition, so it's contained in some associated prime of A/I. Wait, or perhaps there exists an associated prime P of A/I that contains Ann(x + I). But I need to make the connection to the localization.\n\nAlternatively, since P is associated to A/I, there exists an element y + I in A/I such that P = Ann(y + I). Now, consider the element x + I. If x is not in I, then maybe y can be chosen such that multiplying by some element gives a relation. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let's use the given condition that J_A_P ⊆ I_A_P for all P ∈ Ass_A(A/I). So for each such P, if we take x ∈ J, then x/1 is in I_A_P. Therefore, there exists s ∉ P such that s x ∈ I. So for each P ∈ Ass_A(A/I), there exists s_P ∉ P such that s_P x ∈ I. \n\nNow, consider the ideal generated by all these s_P for each associated prime P. Since there are finitely many associated primes (because A is Noetherian), the ideal (s_P | P ∈ Ass_A(A/I)) is generated by finitely many elements. Moreover, since each s_P is not in P, and the primes P are the associated primes of A/I, the ideal generated by the s_P is not contained in any P ∈ Ass_A(A/I). Therefore, by prime avoidance, this ideal must contain 1. Hence, 1 is in the ideal generated by the s_P, so there exist elements a_P ∈ A such that 1 = sum a_P s_P. Then, multiplying x by 1 gives x = sum a_P s_P x. But each s_P x is in I, so x is in I. Therefore, J ⊆ I.\n\nYes, that seems like the right approach. So the key steps are: for each x in J, localize at each associated prime P, get s_P not in P such that s_P x in I, generate an ideal with the s_P, which must be the whole ring, hence x is in I. Therefore, J is contained in I.\n\nI think this is the standard argument using the fact that if an element is locally in the ideal at each associated prime, then it's in the ideal globally, using the finite generation and prime avoidance.",
