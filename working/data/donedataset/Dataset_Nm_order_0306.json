    "Content": "Show that a totally bounded complete metric space $X$ is compact. I can use the fact that sequentially compact $\\Leftrightarrow$ compact. Attempt: Complete $\\implies$ every Cauchy sequence converges. Totally bounded $\\implies$ $\\forall\\epsilon>0$, $X$ can be covered by a finite number of balls of radius $\\epsilon$. I'm trying to show that all sequences in $X$ have a subsequence that converges to an element in $X$. I don't see how to go from convergent Cauchy sequences and totally bounded to subsequence convergent $in$ $X$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You need to show that if $X$ is totally bounded, every sequence in $X$ has a Cauchy subsequence. Let $\\sigma=\\langle x_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\rangle$ be a sequence in $X$. For each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ let $D_n$ be a finite subset of $X$ such that the open balls of radius $2^{-n}$ centred at the points of $D_n$ cover $X$. $D_0$ is finite, so there is a point $y_0\\in D_0$ such that infinitely many terms of $\\sigma$ are in $B(y_0,1)$. Let $$A_0=\\{n\\in\\mathbb{N}:x_n\\in B(y_0,1)\\}\\;,$$ so that $A_0$ is infinite. Now $D_1$ is finite, so there is a $y_1\\in D_1$ such that $$A_1=\\{n\\in A_0:x_n\\in B(y_1,2^{-1})\\}$$ is infinite. Repeat: if $A_k$ is an infinite subset of $\\mathbb{N}$, there must be a $y_{k+1}\\in D_{k+1}$ such that $$A_{k+1}=\\{n\\in A_k:x_n\\in B(y_{k+1},2^{-(k+1)})\\}$$ is infinite, and the process can continue. Now choose a strictly increasing sequence $\\langle n_k:k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\rangle$ of natural numbers in such a way that $n_k\\in A_k$ for every $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Can you show that $\\langle x_{n_k}:k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\rangle$ is Cauchy?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Totally bounded, complete $\\implies$ compact\". The question asks to show that a totally bounded complete metric space $X$ is compact. The user mentions they know that sequentially compact is equivalent to compact, so the strategy is to prove that every sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence (which would imply sequential compactness, hence compactness).\n\nThe user's attempt notes that completeness means every Cauchy sequence converges, and total boundedness means for every $\\epsilon > 0$, the space can be covered by finitely many $\\epsilon$-balls. They're stuck on connecting these to getting convergent subsequences in $X$.\n\nNow, to format this into the required structure. The Assumptions section needs each condition on one object. The problem states that $X$ is a totally bounded and complete metric space. So the assumptions should list each property separately. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"totally bounded complete metric space\". So the assumptions are: $X$ is a metric space, $X$ is totally bounded, and $X$ is complete. Each of these is a separate condition applied to $X$.\n\nThe problem then is to show that $X$ is compact. But since the user mentions using sequential compactness, maybe the problem can be phrased as proving $X$ is compact, which under the equivalence would involve showing sequential compactness. However, the original problem statement is \"Show that a totally bounded complete metric space $X$ is compact.\" So the problem part is exactly that.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $X$ is a metric space.\n- $X$ is totally bounded.\n- $X$ is complete.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $X$ is compact.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions were more specific. For instance, in the example, the user had an assumption that $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumptions are three separate properties all about $X$: being a metric space, totally bounded, and complete. Each should be a separate bullet point.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each assumption on separate lines, then state the problem as showing compactness.",
