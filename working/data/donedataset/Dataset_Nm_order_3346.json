    "Content": "As mentioned in an answer to this question an integer less than $n$ with largest number of divisors can be found exploring the numbers $x$ of the form\n  $$ x = 2^{a_1} 3^{a_2} \\dots p_k^{a_k} \\dots $$\n(where $p_k$ is the $k$-th prime number) with the conditions \n  $$ x \\le n < 2x \\quad \\text{and}\\quad a_1 \\ge a_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge a_k \\ge \\dots$$\nto determine the complexity of this algorithm I would like to know the asymptotic number of tuples $(a_1, a_2, \\dots)$ verifying these conditions as $n\\to \\infty$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "For a given $n$ , let $N(n)$ be the number of admissible exponent sequences, that is, the number of sequences $a_1 \\geqslant a_2 \\geqslant \\ldots$ on nonnegative integers such that $$\\frac{n}{2} < \\prod_{\\nu = 1}^{\\infty} p_{\\nu}^{a_{\\nu}} \\leqslant n\\,. \\tag{1}$$ Then indeed we have $N(n) \\ll_{\\epsilon} n^{\\epsilon}$ for every $\\epsilon > 0$ and $N(n) \\gg_l \\log^l n$ for every $l$ . This is easy to prove if we write the product in $(1)$ as a product of primorials . The non-increasingness of the exponent sequence makes this possible. Define $k = k(n)$ as the index such that $$p_k\\# \\leqslant n < p_{k+1}\\#\\,. \\tag{2}$$ Then by the prime number theorem we have $k \\sim \\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n}$ . If $$\\prod_{\\nu = 1}^{k} (p_{\\nu}\\#)^{b_{\\nu}} \\leqslant n\\,,$$ then a fortiori we have $$(p_{\\nu}\\#)^{b_{\\nu}} \\leqslant n \\iff b_{\\nu} \\leqslant \\frac{\\log n}{\\log (p_{\\nu}\\#)} = \\frac{\\log n}{\\vartheta(p_{\\nu})}$$ for each $\\nu$ . Hence $$N(n) \\leqslant \\prod_{\\nu = 1}^{k}\\biggl(1 + \\biggl\\lfloor \\frac{\\log n}{\\vartheta(p_{\\nu})}\\biggr\\rfloor\\biggr) < 2^k\\prod_{\\nu = 1}^{k} \\frac{\\log n}{\\vartheta (p_{\\nu})}\\,.$$ Now $$2^k = \\exp (k\\log 2) = \\exp \\frac{(1 + o(1))(\\log 2)\\log n}{\\log \\log n} = n^{o(1)}$$ and $$(\\log n)^k = \\exp (k\\log \\log n) = n^{1 + o(1)}$$ are straightforward. To estimate the denominator, we use \\begin{align}\n\\sum_{\\nu = 1}^{k} \\log \\vartheta(p_{\\nu}) &= \\sum_{\\nu = 1}^{k} \\bigl(\\log p_{\\nu} + O(1)\\bigr) \\\\\n&= \\vartheta(p_k) + O(k) \\\\\n&= \\log n + O(\\log \\log n) + O(k) \\\\\n&= \\log n + O\\biggl(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n}\\biggr)\n\\end{align} per the Chebyshev bounds and $(2)$ , thus $$\\prod_{\\nu = 1}^{k} \\vartheta(p_{\\nu}) = n^{1 + O\\bigl(\\frac{1}{\\log \\log n}\\bigr)}\\,.$$ Putting everything together gives $N(n) = n^{o(1)}$ , whence $N(n) \\ll_{\\epsilon} n^{\\epsilon}$ for all $\\epsilon > 0$ . For the lower bound, fix an arbitrary $l > 0$ and assume $n$ is so large that $k > l+1$ . Then we count the products $$\\prod_{\\nu = 2}^{l+1} (p_{\\nu}\\#)^{b_{\\nu}} \\leqslant n\\,.\\tag{3}$$ For every such product there is a unique $b_1$ such that $$\\frac{n}{2} < \\prod_{\\nu = 1}^{l+1} (p_{\\nu}\\#)^{b_{\\nu}} \\leqslant n\\,,$$ hence the number of products $(3)$ is a lower bound for $N(n)$ . These products correspond to the lattice points in the simplex $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^l$ with vertices $0$ and $$\\frac{\\log n}{\\vartheta(p_{\\nu})}\\cdot e_{\\nu-1},\\qquad 2 \\leqslant \\nu \\leqslant l+1,$$ whose ( $l$ -dimensional) volume is $$\\frac{1}{l!}\\prod_{\\nu = 2}^{l+1} \\frac{\\log n}{\\vartheta(p_{\\nu})} = C_l \\cdot \\log^l n\\,.$$ As $n \\to \\infty$ the number of lattice points in $S$ is asymptotically equal to the volume of $S$ , hence $N(n) \\gg_l \\log^l n$ for every $l$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about the asymptotic number of tuples (a₁, a₂, …) that satisfy two conditions. The tuples are exponents in the prime factorization of a number x, which is of the form x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}…p_k^{a_k}… The conditions given are:\n\n1. x ≤ n < 2x\n2. The exponents are non-increasing: a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ … ≥ a_k ≥ …\n\nThe user wants to know the asymptotic behavior of the number of such tuples as n approaches infinity. They suspect it's greater than any power of log n (i.e., ≫ log^l n for every l) and less than any power of n (i.e., ≪ n^ε for every ε > 0). But they need help proving it.\n\nSo, breaking this down into assumptions and the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The number x is of the form x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}…p_k^{a_k}… where p_k is the k-th prime.\n- The exponents satisfy a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ … ≥ a_k ≥ … (they are non-increasing).\n- x ≤ n < 2x.\n\nProblem: Determine the asymptotic number of such tuples (a₁, a₂, …) as n → ∞. Specifically, prove that the number is ≫ log^l n for every l and ≪ n^ε for every ε > 0.\n\nWait, the problem statement in the user's question is about the complexity of an algorithm related to finding the integer ≤n with the largest number of divisors. But the specific problem they want answered is about the asymptotic count of the tuples under the given conditions. So the main task is about the asymptotic number of those tuples.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list the conditions that define the tuples. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let me check the example again. The example had assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" each on separate lines. So each line is a separate assumption about a single object or condition.\n\nIn this case, the objects are x, the exponents a_i, etc. Let me list them:\n\n1. x is a product of primes with exponents: x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}…p_k^{a_k}…\n2. The exponents are non-increasing: a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ … ≥ a_k ≥ …\n3. x satisfies x ≤ n < 2x.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the number of tuples (a₁, a₂, …) that satisfy these conditions. So each tuple corresponds to such an x. So the assumptions are the conditions that the tuple must meet. Each condition is:\n\n- Each exponent a_i is a non-negative integer.\n- The exponents are non-increasing: a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ a₃ ≥ … (and so on).\n- The product x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}… must satisfy x ≤ n and n < 2x.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"the asymptotic number of tuples (a₁, a₂, …) verifying these conditions as n→ ∞.\" So the problem is to find the asymptotic count of such tuples.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The tuple (a₁, a₂, …) consists of non-negative integers.\n- The exponents satisfy a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ a₃ ≥ … .\n- The product x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}… satisfies x ≤ n.\n- The product x satisfies n < 2x.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the conditions are x ≤ n < 2x. So x must be ≤n, and n < 2x, which implies x > n/2. So combining these, n/2 < x ≤ n. So x is in the interval (n/2, n]. However, the problem is phrased as \"x ≤ n < 2x\", which is equivalent to x ≤ n and n < 2x, so indeed x ∈ (n/2, n].\n\nBut in terms of assumptions, the problem's conditions on the tuples are:\n\n1. The number x is defined as the product of primes with exponents a₁, a₂, etc.\n2. The exponents are non-increasing.\n3. x must be ≤n.\n4. n must be < 2x.\n\nBut when structuring assumptions, each line should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- The tuple (a₁, a₂, …) consists of non-negative integers,\n- The exponents satisfy a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ a₃ ≥ …,\n- The product x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}… is ≤ n,\n- The product x satisfies n < 2x.\n\nBut the original problem says \"x ≤ n < 2x\". So that's two separate conditions: x ≤n and n <2x. So each as separate assumptions?\n\nYes, according to the example, each assumption is a single condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- Each a_i is a non-negative integer,\n- The exponents satisfy a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ a₃ ≥ …,\n- The product x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}… satisfies x ≤ n,\n- The product x satisfies n < 2x.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was split into two lines: \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, each condition is separate.\n\nBut in this problem, the exponents are non-negative integers, but the problem may not explicitly state that. Wait, the question says \"the tuples (a₁, a₂, …)\" which are exponents in the prime factorization, which are non-negative integers by definition. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user writes \"tuples (a₁, a₂, …)\" where x is of the form 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}… So exponents are non-negative integers. So we can list that as an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each exponent a_i is a non-negative integer,\n- The exponents are non-increasing: a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ a₃ ≥ …,\n- The product x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}… satisfies x ≤ n,\n- The product x satisfies n < 2x.\n\nBut the problem is to find the number of such tuples as n→infty, and show it's ≫ log^l n for every l and ≪ n^ε for every ε>0.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: Each a_i is a non-negative integer,\nAssumption: The exponents satisfy a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ a₃ ≥ …,\nAssumption: x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}… satisfies x ≤ n,\nAssumption: x satisfies n < 2x.\n\nProblem: Determine the asymptotic number of tuples (a₁, a₂, …) as n → ∞. Prove that this number is ≫ log^l n for every l and ≪ n^ε for every ε > 0.\n\nBut in the example, the problem statement was concise. Maybe rephrase the problem part to be more direct.\n\nProblem: Determine the asymptotic behavior of the number of tuples (a₁, a₂, …) verifying the conditions as n→ ∞, specifically proving that it is ≫ log^l n for every l and ≪ n^ε for every ε > 0.\n\nAlternatively, the user's original problem says: \"I would like to know the asymptotic number of tuples... as n→ ∞. I suspect that this number is ≫ log^l n for every l and ≪ n^ε for every ε>0, but I don't know how to prove it.\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove the asymptotic bounds.\n\nHence, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach exponent a_i is a non-negative integer,\nThe exponents satisfy a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ a₃ ≥ …,\nThe product x = 2^{a₁}3^{a₂}… satisfies x ≤ n,\nThe product x satisfies n < 2x.\n\nProblem: Prove that the asymptotic number of tuples (a₁, a₂, …) is ≫ log^l n for every l and ≪ n^ε for every ε > 0 as n → ∞.\n\nBut to ensure each assumption is applied to one object, perhaps split the x conditions. However, the two conditions on x are separate: x ≤n and n <2x. So each should be a separate assumption.\n\nSo, the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: Each exponent $a_i$ is a non-negative integer,\nAssumption: The exponents satisfy $a_1 \\ge a_2 \\ge a_3 \\ge \\dots$,\nAssumption: The product $x = 2^{a_1} 3^{a_2} \\dots$ satisfies $x \\le n$,\nAssumption: The product $x$ satisfies $n < 2x$.\nProblem: Prove that the asymptotic number of tuples $(a_1, a_2, \\dots)$ is $\\gg \\log^l n$ for every $l$ and $\\ll n^\\epsilon$ for every $\\epsilon > 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$.",
