    "AcceptedAnswer": "Define $$\\phi: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}[i]/(3-i) \\text{ where } \\phi(z) = z + (3-i)\\mathbb{Z}[i].$$ It follows simply that $\\ker \\phi = (3-i)\\mathbb{Z}[i] \\cap \\mathbb{Z}$ .\nSo for any such $z \\in \\ker \\phi$ , we have $z = (3-i)(a+bi)$ for some $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ . But $(3-i)(a+bi) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ happens if and only if $3b-a=0$ .\nSo $$\\begin{align*}\n\\ker \\phi = (3-i)\\mathbb{Z}[i] \\cap \\mathbb{Z} &= \\{(3-i)(3b+bi)\\mid b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\\\\n&= \\{(9b + b) + i(3b-3b)\\mid b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\\\\n&= \\{10b\\mid b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\\\\n&= 10\\mathbb{Z}.\n\\end{align*}$$ To see $\\phi$ is surjective, let $(a+bi) + (3-i)\\mathbb{Z}[i] \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]/(3-i)$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the ring of Gaussian integers modulo (3 - i) is isomorphic to the integers modulo 10. They also mention extending this result to a general case where a and b are coprime. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some concepts about Gaussian integers. The ring Z[i] consists of complex numbers a + bi where a and b are integers. The key here is understanding quotient rings of Z[i]. The problem states that Z[i]/(a + bi) is isomorphic to Z/(a² + b²) when a and b are coprime. In the specific example, a is 3 and b is 1, so a² + b² = 10, hence Z/10Z.\n\nThe user tried defining a map from Z[i] to Z/10Z but couldn't find the right one. Let's think about possible maps. Since we're dealing with the ideal generated by 3 - i, the map should have kernel (3 - i). A common approach is to map a Gaussian integer a + bi to a + 3b mod 10. Wait, why 3b? Because 3 - i = 0 in the quotient, so i ≡ 3 mod (3 - i). Therefore, in the quotient ring, any Gaussian integer a + bi can be reduced by substituting i with 3. So replacing i with 3 gives a + 3b. Then, taking this modulo 10 would make sense because 3² + 1² = 10, so modulo 10 would capture the necessary relations. Let's check: If we define φ(a + bi) = a + 3b mod 10, then φ(3 - i) = 3 + 3(-1) = 0 mod 10, which is in the kernel. Now, we need to verify that this map is surjective and the kernel is exactly the ideal generated by (3 - i). \n\nFor surjectivity, since we can get any integer mod 10 by choosing appropriate a and b. For example, if we set b = 0, then φ(a) = a mod 10. If we need a different residue, adjust b accordingly. The kernel would consist of all Gaussian integers a + bi such that a + 3b ≡ 0 mod 10. But since in the quotient ring Z[i]/(3 - i), every element can be written as an integer modulo 10 by replacing i with 3. So this map should induce an isomorphism. \n\nTo generalize, when we have (a - bi) where a and b are coprime, then the norm is a² + b². The isomorphism would follow similarly by mapping a + bi to some linear combination modulo a² + b². The key is using the coprimality to ensure that the map is surjective, which relies on the Chinese Remainder Theorem or Bézout's identity because a and b being coprime allows certain linear combinations to cover all residues modulo a² + b².\n\nSo the assumptions here are that we're working with the ring of Gaussian integers, the ideal is generated by a - bi, and a and b are coprime integers. The problem is to show the isomorphism between the quotient ring and the integers modulo the norm a² + b².",
