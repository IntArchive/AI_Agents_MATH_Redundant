    "Content": "Let $A$ be a C*-algebra and $p,q \\in A$ be projections. Assume there is an element $a\\in A$ such that $\\|aa^*-p\\|<\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\|a^*a-q\\|<\\frac{1}{4}$. Then there is a partial isometry $v$ with $vv^*=p$ and $v^*v=q$. This is considered obvious in the paper I'm reading. I've tried to mimic the proof of the following proposition. Let $p$, $q$ be projections in a C*-algebra A. If $\\|p-q\\|<1$ then p and q are unitarily \n  equivalent. Which involves using a suitable expression ($1-p-q+2pq$) and polar decomposition. But it's not going anywhere.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One can prove that $p,q$ are Murray -von-Neumann equivalent if they fulfill\n$$\n\\|aa^*-p\\|<\\frac 12,\\quad \\|a^*a-q\\|<\\frac 12.\n$$\nThe proof is standard (for example it is outlined in the comment of @ougao), I was just lucky to find $\\|(1/2-p)^{-1}\\|=2$. We first assume that the $C^*$-algebra $A$ is unital. First note that $(1-2p)^2=1$, hence $(1-2p)$ is its own inverse and $\\|1-2p\\|=1$. \nIt follows that the inverse of $\\frac 12-p$ is $2-4p$ and that $\\|2-4p\\|=2$.\nIf $\\|aa^*-p\\|<\\frac 12$, then $\\|aa^*\\|< \\frac 32$ and $Spec(aa^*)\\subset [0,\\frac 32[\\subset\\Bbb{R}$.\nMoreover, since $\\frac 12-p$ is invertible and $\\|p-aa^*\\|<\\frac{1}{\\|(\\frac 12-p)^{-1}\\|}$, we have that\n$\\frac 12-p+p-aa^*=\\frac 12-aa^*$ is invertible. This means that the spectrum of $aa^*$ has a gap at $\\frac 12$, i.e., \nan open interval around $\\frac 12$ which does not intersect $Spec(aa^*)$, since $Spec(aa^*)$ is closed. Hence there exists an $r\\in]0,\\frac 12[$ such that \n$$\nSpec(aa^*)\\subset  B_r(0)\\cup B_r(1).\n$$\nSimilarly we find that \n$$\nSpec(a^*a)\\subset  B_{r_1}(0)\\cup B_{r_1}(1),\n$$\nand we can assume that $r=r_1$. We define on $D:=(B_{r}(0)\\cup B_{r}(1))\\cap\\Bbb{R}$ the continuous function\n$$\nf(x)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lr} 0& \\text{if $x\\in B_r(0)$}\\\\\n1/\\sqrt{x}& \\text{if $x\\in B_r(1)$.}\n    \\end{array}  \\right.\n$$\nNote that on $D$ the function $xf^2(x)$ is a projection with a distance less than $r$ to the identity function, i.e., $x^2f^4(x)=xf^2(x)$. $|xf^2(x)-x|\\le r$. Then we apply functional calculus and set $v:= f(aa^*)a$. We have that $vv^*=aa^*f^2(aa^*)$ and moreover, by 1.,\n$$\n(vv^*)^2=(aa^*)^2f^4(aa^*)=aa^*f^2(aa^*).\n$$\nNote that for any continuous function $f$ on $D$ we have $a^*f(aa^*)a=a^*af(a^*a)$ (this holds for polynomials and $f$ is the limit of polynomials). Therefore we have $v^*v=a^*f^2(aa^*)a=a^*af^2(a^*a)$ and so, by 1.,\n$$\n(v^*v)^2=(a^*a)^2f^4(a^*a)=a^*af^2(a^*a).\n$$\nSo $vv^*$ and $v^*v$ are equivalent projections (they are the range projections of $aa^*$ and $a^*a$ respectively) and we compute\n$$\n\\|vv^*-p\\|\\le \\|vv^*-aa^*\\|+\\|aa^*-p\\|< r+\\frac 12<1,\n$$\nwhere $\\|vv^*-aa^*\\|\\le r$ follows from 2. Similarly \n$$\n\\|v^*v-q\\|\\le \\|v^*v-a^*a\\|+\\|a^*a-q\\|< r+\\frac 12<1,\n$$\nwhere $\\|v^*v-a^*a\\|\\le r$ follows from 2. Since $A$ is unital, there are unitary elements $u,s$ with $uvv^*u^*=p$ and $v^*v=sqs^*$. Then\n$(uvs)^*uvs=q$ and $uvs(uvs)^*=p$. Finally we prove the general case. If $A$ is non-unital, embed it into its unitalization $A^\\sim$, and there $p$ and $q$ are Murray-von-Neumann equivalent, i.e., there exists $b\\in A^\\sim$, such that $bb^*=p$ and $b^*b=q$. But then $b=pb$, since $\\|(b-pb)(b-pb)^*\\|=0$, and so, since $A$ is an ideal in $A^\\sim$ we have that $b\\in A$, hence $p,q$ are Murray-von-Neumann equivalent in $A$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question: It's about projections in a C*-algebra. The assumptions given are that there's an element 'a' in the algebra such that the norm of aa* minus p is less than 1/4, and similarly the norm of a*a minus q is less than 1/4. The problem is to show that there exists a partial isometry v with vv* = p and v*v = q, making p and q Murray-von Neumann equivalent.\n\nWait, the user's example included assumptions listed line by line, each applying to one object. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. A is a C*-algebra.\n2. p and q are projections in A.\n3. There exists an element a in A such that ||aa* - p|| < 1/4.\n4. There exists an element a in A such that ||a*a - q|| < 1/4.\n\nBut the original problem mentions both conditions on a, so maybe split those into two separate assumptions. Also, note that the same element 'a' satisfies both norm conditions. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a C*-algebra.\n- p is a projection in A.\n- q is a projection in A.\n- There exists an element a ∈ A such that ||aa* - p|| < 1/4.\n- There exists an element a ∈ A such that ||a*a - q|| < 1/4.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"there is an element a in A\" such that both conditions hold. So maybe it's one element a that satisfies both inequalities. So perhaps:\n\n- A is a C*-algebra.\n- p and q are projections in A.\n- There exists an element a ∈ A such that ||aa* - p|| < 1/4 and ||a*a - q|| < 1/4.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe split the two norm conditions into separate assumptions, even though they are about the same element. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a C*-algebra,\np is a projection in A,\nq is a projection in A,\nthere exists an element a in A,\nthe norm of aa* - p is less than 1/4,\nthe norm of a*a - q is less than 1/4.\n\nYes, that follows the example where each condition is a separate line. So each line is a single condition. The problem then is to prove that there's a partial isometry v with vv* = p and v*v = q.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have these assumptions, each on a separate line, and the problem statement as given.",
