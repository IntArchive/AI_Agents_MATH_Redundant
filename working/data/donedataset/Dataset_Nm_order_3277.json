    "AcceptedAnswer": "As I have learned from Gabor Tardos (and Peter Csikvari) this is well-known and can be proved easily using the submodularity of entropy. First we reduce the problem to the finite case by approximating $P$ by a collection of cubes. Then let us select a cube uniformly random and denote its $i$-th coordinate by $X_i$. We have\n$$\\log Vol^2(P)=H(X_1,X_2,X_3)+H(X_1,X_2,X_3)\\le H(X_1,X_2)+H(X_1,X_3)-H(X_1)+H(X_1,X_2,X_3)\\le H(X_1,X_2)+H(X_1,X_3)+H(X_2,X_3)\\le \\Pi_{i=x,y,z} Area(Proj_i(P)).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break down this problem. The user is asking about proving that the square of the volume of a 3-dimensional object P is less than or equal to the product of the areas of its projections onto the three coordinate planes (x-y, y-z, x-z). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the assumptions here. The problem mentions that P is a subset of R^3. So the main object here is P, which is in three-dimensional space. The projections are onto the three orthogonal planes: Proj_x(P) would be the projection onto the y-z plane, Proj_y(P) onto the x-z, and Proj_z(P) onto the x-y plane. The volume of P is a standard 3D volume, and the areas of the projections are 2D areas. \n\nThe inequality given is Vol²(P) ≤ product of the areas of the three projections. The user also mentions that this was an IMO problem in 1992, so there might be a known solution that is elegant. However, the user is looking for a simple proof, possibly avoiding their complicated method involving shifts. \n\nNow, when structuring this into the required format, the assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem statement itself is to prove the inequality. Let me check if there are any implicit assumptions. For example, does P need to be a convex set? The problem states P is any subset of R³, but in the original IMO problem, maybe they considered convex bodies or polyhedra? Wait, the original problem (since it's IMO 1992 Problem 5) probably specifies convex bodies. Wait, no, actually, let me recall. The original IMO problem might state something like: Let P be a parallelepiped in 3D space, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the problem as stated here is general for any P, but the solution might require certain conditions like measurability. \n\nWait, the user's question here says \"P ⊂ R³\" and they are talking about projections. So the assumptions should include that P is a measurable set in R³, since otherwise volume and areas wouldn't be defined. But the user's original problem statement doesn't specify that. However, in mathematical analysis, when dealing with volumes and projections, we usually assume measurability. But maybe in the context of an IMO problem, they are dealing with convex polyhedra or something else. However, since the user hasn't specified, but in the problem statement as written, it's just P is a subset of R³, so the main assumption is that P is a measurable subset of R³. However, the original problem as posed by the user doesn't mention measurability, but in reality, to talk about volume and areas, we need that. So perhaps the assumptions should include that P is a measurable subset of R³. But the user might not have stated that explicitly. So do I include that as an assumption?\n\nIn the example given by the user, the original problem was about an integer n, and in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me check. In the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that would change the problem from \"for every integer n\" to \"for integers n divisible by 7\". Maybe that example was a mistake? Or perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information, perhaps the original problem had some other conditions?\n\nWait, maybe in the example, the user restructured the problem by extracting the assumptions. So if the original problem said \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is that n is an integer. But if there's a hidden assumption, like n being divisible by 7, maybe the problem actually has that. Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the formatted problem is actually incorrect in adding \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, unless the original problem had a typo. Wait, maybe the example given by the user was not accurate. Hmm. This is confusing. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. The original question is: Prove that Vol²(P) ≤ product of the areas of the projections onto the three coordinate planes, for P ⊂ R³. The user mentions that the problem was IMO 1992 Problem 5, so maybe I should check what the exact original problem statement was.\n\nLooking up IMO 1992 Problem 5: It states: Let S be a finite set of points in three-dimensional space. Let Sₓ, Sᵧ, S_z be the orthogonal projections of S onto the three coordinate planes. Prove that |S|² ≤ |Sₓ| |Sᵧ| |S_z|, where |S| denotes the number of elements of S.\n\nAh, so the original IMO problem was about a finite set of points and their projections. The inequality is |S|² ≤ |Sₓ| |Sᵧ| |S_z|. But the user here is asking about volumes and areas. So the user has generalized the problem from finite sets (with cardinality) to volumes (for measurable sets). Therefore, the problem here is a continuous analog of the IMO problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here are that P is a measurable subset of R³, with finite volume, and the projections onto the three coordinate planes have finite areas. So in the structured problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- P is a subset of R³.\n- P is measurable.\n- The volume of P is finite.\n- The projections of P onto the x, y, z coordinate planes have finite areas.\n\nBut the original problem as stated by the user does not specify measurability, but in the context of volume and area, we need those assumptions. Therefore, when structuring the problem, we need to include those as assumptions.\n\nHowever, the user's example included assumptions that were perhaps not all explicitly stated in the original problem. For instance, in their example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, or maybe the original problem had an error.\n\nBut regardless, in this case, the user's problem statement says \"P ⊂ R³\", and wants to prove the inequality. So following the example's structure, even if the original problem doesn't state some assumptions explicitly, we need to list the necessary ones.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- P is a subset of three-dimensional real space (R³).\n- P is measurable (to have a well-defined volume).\n- The projections of P onto the x, y, and z coordinate planes are measurable sets (to have well-defined areas).\n\nBut maybe the problem is intended for any P, even non-measurable? But in standard mathematics, volume and area require measurability. Therefore, it's safe to assume measurability. So those are the key assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, the original IMO problem was about finite sets, but here it's about volumes, so the problem is a continuous version. Therefore, the assumptions are as above.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^3$,\nP is Lebesgue-measurable,\n$\\text{Vol}(P)$ is finite,\nFor each $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$, $\\text{Proj}_i(P)$ is Lebesgue-measurable,\n$\\text{Area}(\\text{Proj}_i(P))$ is finite for each $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\text{Vol}^2(P) \\le \\prod_{i=x,y,z} \\text{Area}(\\text{Proj}_i(P)).$$\n\nBut perhaps the user's original problem doesn't specify Lebesgue-measurable, but in the context, it's necessary. However, in the problem statement, they just write P ⊂ R³. But if we follow the example given, which included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (adding n divisible by 7 when original problem said for every integer n), maybe here we need to only list the assumptions explicitly given in the problem. Wait, the user says \"filtered the unrelated informations\". So perhaps the task is to read the problem, filter out unrelated info (like the update mentioning IMO 1992), and structure the problem with assumptions that are already in the problem.\n\nLooking back at the original question:\n\nQuestion: Is there a simple proof for $$\n  \\text{Vol}^2(P)\\le \\prod_{i=x,y,z} \\text{Area}(\\text{Proj}_i(P)),\n$$ where $P\\subset \\mathbb R^3$ and $\\text{Proj}_z(P)$ denotes the projection of $P$ to the $z=0$ plane? I have a complicated proof for this (in any dimension) using shifts but I wonder if this inequality is something well-known/simple. Update 2024. I've just discovered that this was Problem 5 on the IMO in 1992.\n\nSo the original problem states \"where P is a subset of R³\". The user mentions projections. The only explicit assumption given is that P is a subset of R³. The other conditions (measurability, finite volume and areas) are not mentioned, but necessary for the statement to make sense. However, if we follow the example, where the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", which actually changes the problem. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, perhaps for this task, the goal is to extract only the assumptions explicitly given in the problem, not the implicit ones.\n\nBut the problem says \"where P⊂ℝ³\". So that's an explicit assumption. The rest (measurability, etc.) are not mentioned. So following the user's example, perhaps we only list the assumptions given in the problem. However, the example given by the user seems to have added an assumption that was not in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. So maybe the user's example is flawed, but regardless, we have to follow their instruction to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about proving the inequality for P⊂ℝ³. The only explicit assumption is that P is a subset of ℝ³. The rest (measurability, finite volume, etc.) are implicit. But according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So similarly, here, the assumption is \"P is a subset of ℝ³\". However, in the example, the formatted problem added an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. So that seems like a mistake in the example. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and the actual task is to list the assumptions as given in the problem, splitting them into separate lines.\n\nIn the original problem here: \"where P⊂ℝ³\". So the assumption is \"P is a subset of ℝ³\". But the original problem also mentions projections onto the coordinate planes. The projections are defined as Proj_z(P) to z=0 plane, similarly for x and y. So another assumption could be that the projections are onto the standard coordinate planes. But that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So maybe the only assumption is that P is a subset of ℝ³.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\". Similarly, here, the original problem says \"where P⊂ℝ³\", so the assumption is \"P is a subset of ℝ³\". But perhaps also that projections are taken onto the three coordinate planes. However, that's part of the problem statement. For instance, in the example, the problem mentioned \"Proj_z(P)\" which is part of the expression, not an assumption. Therefore, the only explicit assumption is that P is a subset of ℝ³. The rest are part of the problem's statement.\n\nTherefore, following the example's structure, where the original problem's conditions are converted into assumptions, the formatted problem here would have:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\text{Vol}^2(P) \\le \\prod_{i=x,y,z} \\text{Area}(\\text{Proj}_i(P)).$$\n\nBut this seems minimal. However, in the example, the user had added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7). But maybe in the original example, the problem had a typo or required divisibility by 7. Wait, 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem actually required divisibility by 91 for all integers n, but the user in the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would be incorrect. So perhaps the example was wrong.\n\nTherefore, given this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to extract only the explicitly stated assumptions in the original problem. For the current problem, the original problem states \"where P⊂ℝ³\". So the assumption is that P is a subset of ℝ³. The problem is to prove the inequality involving volume squared and the product of projection areas. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\text{Vol}^2(P) \\le \\prod_{i=x,y,z} \\text{Area}(\\text{Proj}_i(P)).$$\n\nHowever, considering that the original IMO problem dealt with finite sets, but here it's about volume and area, perhaps there are implicit assumptions of measurability. But if the user's original problem doesn't mention that, then we shouldn't include it unless it's standard. However, in the example given, even if the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, the formatted problem added it. But since that might be an error, perhaps we should stick to the problem as written.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is as above. But to confirm, the user wants to \"filter the unrelated informations\". In the original question, the user added an update about IMO 1992, which is additional information, so we filter that out. The problem is to prove the inequality for P⊂ℝ³, with projections onto the coordinate planes. Therefore, the assumptions are just P being a subset of ℝ³. But the problem statement mentions projections onto the coordinate planes, which are part of the definitions in the problem, not assumptions. So the only assumption is P⊂ℝ³.\n\nTherefore, following the user's example (even if potentially flawed), the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\text{Vol}^2(P) \\le \\prod_{i=x,y,z} \\text{Area}(\\text{Proj}_i(P)).$$\n\nThat's concise and follows the example's structure, listing the explicit assumption.",
