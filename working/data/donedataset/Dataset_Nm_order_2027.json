    "Content": "The wikipedia article on sheaves says: It can be shown that to specify a sheaf, it is enough to specify its restriction to the open sets of a basis for the topology of the underlying space. Moreover, it can also be shown that it is enough to verify the sheaf axioms above relative to the open sets of a covering. Thus a sheaf can often be defined by giving its values on the open sets of a basis, and verifying the sheaf axioms relative to the basis. However, it does not cite a specific reference for this statement. Does there exist a rigorous proof for this statement in the literature?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is an excellent question and to tell the truth it is often handled in a cavalier fashion in the literature. This is a pity because it is a fundamental concept in algebraic geometry. For example  the structural sheaf $\\mathcal O_X$ of an affine scheme $X=Spec(A)$ is defined by saying that over a basic open set $D(f)\\subset X \\;(f\\in A)$ its value is $\\Gamma(D(f),\\mathcal O_X)=A_f$ and then relying on the mechanism of sheaves on a basis to extend this to a sheaf on $X$. The same procedure is also  followed in defining the quasi-coherent sheaf of modules $\\tilde M$ on $X$ associated to the $A$-module $M$. However there are happy exceptions on the net , like Lucien Szpiro's notes where sheaves on a basis of open sets are discussed in detail on pages 14-16. You can also find a careful treatment in De Jong and collaborators' Stack Project , Chapter 6 \"Sheaves on Spaces\", section 30,  \"Bases and sheaves\"",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line and then the problem.\n\nLooking at the original question from Math Stack Exchange: The user is asking for a reference to the statement that specifying a sheaf on a basis of the topology is sufficient, and verifying the sheaf axioms relative to that basis. They mention that Wikipedia states this but lacks a citation, so they want a literature reference with a rigorous proof.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions here. The problem is about sheaves and bases for a topology. The key assumptions would relate to the definitions involved. Let me parse the question carefully.\n\nThe statement is that to define a sheaf, it's enough to specify it on a basis and verify the sheaf axioms on that basis. So the assumptions would likely include things about the existence of a basis for the topology, the presheaf defined on the basis, and the sheaf axioms being satisfied on the basis.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions were specific to the problem. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the current problem, the question is more about a general statement in sheaf theory. So the assumptions here might be more about the underlying mathematical structures.\n\nWait, but the original problem doesn't list specific numerical conditions but rather refers to a general theorem. The user's example had specific conditions, but here it's a theoretical question. So perhaps the assumptions here are about the properties required for the basis and the presheaf.\n\nBut in the user's format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me think: The problem is about sheaves on a topological space, and the basis of the topology. The key points are:\n\n1. There exists a basis for the topology of the underlying space.\n2. A presheaf is defined on the basis open sets.\n3. The presheaf satisfies the sheaf axioms relative to the basis.\n\nBut the problem is asking for a reference where this is proven. So maybe the assumptions are the standard conditions required for the theorem to hold, such as the basis being closed under finite intersections, which is usually required for such extension theorems.\n\nWait, in sheaf theory, when you define a sheaf on a basis, the basis needs to satisfy certain conditions, like being closed under finite intersections. That might be an assumption. Also, the presheaf on the basis has to satisfy the sheaf axioms for covers by basis open sets.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions would be:\n\n- The underlying space has a basis for its topology.\n- The basis is closed under finite intersections.\n- The presheaf is defined on the basis open sets.\n- The presheaf satisfies the sheaf axioms relative to covers by basis open sets.\n\nBut the original question doesn't mention these assumptions; it's just quoting Wikipedia's statement. However, the user wants to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions. Since the original problem is asking for a reference to the proof of that statement, the assumptions would be inherent to the theorem's conditions.\n\nSo perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- The underlying space has a basis for its topology.\n- The basis is closed under finite intersections.\n- A presheaf is defined on the basis open sets.\n- The presheaf satisfies the sheaf axioms on the basis.\n\nBut I need to check if these are indeed required. In standard sheaf theory, for the theorem that a sheaf on a basis extends uniquely to a sheaf on the whole space, the basis needs to be closed under finite intersections. So that's a crucial condition. Therefore, the assumptions would include that the basis is closed under finite intersections.\n\nHowever, the original problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange doesn't explicitly mention these conditions. The user is just quoting Wikipedia, which might have omitted the closure under intersections part. But since the user is asking for a rigorous proof, the assumptions would need to include that the basis is closed under finite intersections.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe underlying space has a basis for its topology,\nThe basis is closed under finite intersections,\nA presheaf is defined on the basis open sets,\nThe presheaf satisfies the sheaf axioms relative to the basis.\n\nProblem:\nProvide a reference with a rigorous proof that the presheaf extends uniquely to a sheaf on the space.\n\nWait, but the original problem's exact wording is: \"to specify a sheaf, it is enough to specify its restriction to the open sets of a basis... it is enough to verify the sheaf axioms relative to the open sets of a covering. Thus a sheaf can often be defined by giving its values on the open sets of a basis, and verifying the sheaf axioms relative to the basis.\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove (or find a reference that proves) that under certain conditions (the basis being closed under finite intersections, etc.), specifying a sheaf on a basis with the sheaf axioms on the basis is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include the conditions on the basis and the presheaf.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- The topology has a basis closed under finite intersections.\n- The presheaf on the basis satisfies the sheaf axioms for basis covers.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have these assumptions, and the problem is to prove that the presheaf extends uniquely to a sheaf.\n\nBut the original question is asking for a reference where this is proven, so the problem is to provide such a reference.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem statement is \"Prove that...\", but here it's a reference request. However, the user's format requires stating the problem. So maybe the problem is as stated in the original question: \"Prove that it is enough to specify a sheaf on a basis...\", but the user is asking for a reference. However, the user's example transformed the original problem into a structured format with assumptions and the problem statement. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility, and the formatted problem restates it with assumptions.\n\nIn this case, the original problem is a reference request, but according to the user's instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the format. The example given by the user had the problem restated with assumptions even though the original was a proof request. So here, the problem would be structured as:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The underlying space has a basis for its topology.\n- The basis is closed under finite intersections.\n- A presheaf is defined on the basis open sets.\n- The presheaf satisfies the sheaf axioms relative to covers by basis open sets.\n\nProblem:\n\nProvide a rigorous proof or reference that the presheaf extends uniquely to a sheaf on the space.\n\nBut the original question says \"to specify a sheaf, it is enough to specify its restriction to a basis...\", so perhaps the problem is: Prove that specifying a sheaf on a basis (with the sheaf axioms relative to the basis) uniquely extends to a sheaf on the entire space.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe underlying space has a basis for its topology,\nThe basis is closed under finite intersections,\nA presheaf is defined on the basis open sets,\nThe presheaf satisfies the sheaf axioms relative to the basis.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the presheaf extends uniquely to a sheaf on the entire space.\n\nBut the original question is asking for a reference, not to prove it. However, the user's example transformed the original problem into the problem statement with assumptions, even if the original was a proof request. Here, the user's question is a reference request, but according to the task, we need to structure the problem as per the format, which includes listing assumptions and the problem.\n\nSo maybe the problem part is: \"Provide a reference for the statement that it is enough to specify a sheaf on a basis of the topology and verify the sheaf axioms relative to the basis.\"\n\nBut the user's example took the original problem's content and structured it, even if the original was asking for a proof. Here, the original is asking for a reference, so perhaps the problem is: \"Find a reference in the literature that provides a rigorous proof that specifying a sheaf on a basis of the topology and verifying the sheaf axioms relative to the basis is sufficient to define a sheaf.\"\n\nBut the user's example didn't include \"find a reference\" in the problem statement; they transformed the original problem's request into a structured problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem was to prove that under certain assumptions. So here, similarly, even though the original is asking for a reference, perhaps the task is to structure the mathematical problem that the user is asking about, not the reference request itself.\n\nWait, the user says: \"Your task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nThe example given was a problem to prove something, and the formatted version listed assumptions and the problem. The current question is a reference request, but the core mathematical problem is about the theorem that specifying a sheaf on a basis is enough. Therefore, perhaps the task is to structure the theorem itself as the problem, with its assumptions, and the problem being to prove it.\n\nSo even though the original question is asking for a reference, the underlying mathematical problem is the theorem. Hence, structuring the theorem as the problem with its assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe topology of the space has a basis closed under finite intersections,\nA presheaf is defined on the basis open sets,\nThe presheaf satisfies the sheaf axioms for covers consisting of basis open sets.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the presheaf uniquely extends to a sheaf on the entire space.\n\nThis way, it's structured like the example, where the problem is to prove the statement under certain assumptions.\n\nThus, the answer would list the assumptions related to the basis and presheaf, and the problem is to prove the extension.",
