If $p$ is a prime, then the number of times $p$ divides $N!$ is $e_p(N)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $p$ be a prime number. You should show that $$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{5m}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{5n}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor \\geq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{3m+n}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{3n+m}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor$$ for $k \\geq 1.$ By Hermite's identity you will get $$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{5m}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{p^k}+\\frac{1}{5}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{p^k}+\\frac{2}{5}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{p^k}+\\frac{3}{5}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{p^k}+\\frac{4}{5}\\right\\rfloor$$ Then you should show that $$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{p^k}+\\frac{i}{5}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{j=1}^{4}\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^k}+\\frac{j}{5}\\right\\rfloor \\geq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3m+n}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{3n+m}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor$$ which can be done by considering different cases for the values $\\frac{m}{p^k}, \\frac{n}{p^k}$ i.e. each can be in the following intervals $(0,\\frac15), [\\frac15, \\frac25), [\\frac25, \\frac35), [\\frac35, \\frac45), [\\frac45, 1),$ since $\\lfloor x+n \\rfloor=\\lfloor x\\rfloor+n,$ for and real number $x$ and an integer $n,$ you can just ignore the case when $\\frac{m}{p^k}, \\frac{n}{p^k}$ are bigger that $1.$ Earlier thought: The expression can be rewritten as $$\\frac{\\binom{5m}{3m}(3m)!\\binom{5n}{n}n!}{(3m+n)!} \\frac {\\binom{4n}{3n}(3n)!\\binom{2m}{m}m!}{(3n+m)!}$$ I was hoping to find a combinatorial interpretation for this expression but I haven't found yet!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The original question is asking to prove that a certain fraction involving factorials is a natural number for all natural numbers m and n where m and n are at least 1. \n\nSo, the problem statement is about the expression (5m!)(5n!)/(m!n!(3m + n)!(3n + m)!) being natural. The user mentioned that m and n are in the set of natural numbers, specifically m ≥ 1 and n ≥ 1. \n\nNow, looking at the assumptions, the original problem states that m and n are natural numbers and both are at least 1. The user also mentions using the formula for the exponent of a prime p in N!, which is the sum of floor(N/p^k). However, that part is part of the approach to solving the problem, not an assumption. So the key assumptions here are the conditions on m and n.\n\nThe example given in the problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. In this case, the assumptions would be similar but for m and n. Each assumption should address one property for one object. So, each line should list a separate condition.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- m is a natural number.\n- n is a natural number.\n- m is at least 1.\n- n is at least 1.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it's given that m and n are in the set of natural numbers and m ≥ 1, n ≥ 1. Since in some definitions, natural numbers start at 1, but sometimes at 0. However, the problem specifies m and n are in N and m ≥ 1, n ≥ 1. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- m is a natural number.\n- n is a natural number.\n- m ≥ 1.\n- n ≥ 1.\n\nBut maybe in the problem's context, since they specify m and n are in N and m ≥1 and n ≥1, perhaps we can combine the first two into \"m and n are natural numbers\" but the example shows each assumption on separate lines. Wait, in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate lines. So following that structure, each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition on one object.\n\nBut here, m and n are separate objects. So maybe:\n\n- m is a natural number.\n- n is a natural number.\n- m ≥ 1.\n- n ≥ 1.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user writes \"∀ m,n ∈ ℕ, m ≥ 1 and n ≥ 1\". So they are already in ℕ, which is natural numbers, but they add m ≥1 and n ≥1. Depending on the definition of ℕ, sometimes it starts at 1, sometimes at 0. But since they explicitly state m ≥1 and n ≥1, perhaps ℕ here includes 0, but they want m and n to be at least 1. So the assumptions should reflect that m and n are in natural numbers, and each is at least 1.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nm is a natural number,\nn is a natural number,\nm ≥ 1,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nEach as separate lines. That way, each line addresses one condition for one object. Then the problem is to prove that the given fraction is a natural number under those assumptions.\n\nNow, checking the original problem's body. The user mentions that if p is a prime, then the exponent of p in N! is given by that formula, and then they need the inequality. But that's part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the assumptions are only the conditions on m and n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those four assumptions listed line by line, and the problem statement as given.",
