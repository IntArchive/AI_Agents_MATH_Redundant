    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help format this problem according to the user's guidelines. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user provided a problem from Math Stack Exchange where they need to find f'(0) for f(x) defined as the integral from 0 to x of sin(1/t) dt. They mention that the fundamental theorem of calculus doesn't apply here, and they want to know how to proceed.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The instructions say each assumption should be one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break it down.\n\nThe function f(x) is given as an integral from 0 to x of sin(1/t) dt. The variable here is x, and the integral's upper limit is x. The integrand is sin(1/t). Now, when x is 0, the integral is from 0 to 0, which is 0. But the problem is about f'(0), the derivative at 0. \n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus (FTC) usually tells us that if the integrand is continuous on the interval, then the derivative is just the integrand evaluated at the upper limit. But in this case, sin(1/t) has a problem at t=0; it oscillates wildly as t approaches 0. So the integrand isn't continuous at t=0, which means FTC Part 1 doesn't apply directly here. That's why the user says FTC is inapplicable.\n\nSo the assumptions here are about the function f(x). Let's list them:\n\n1. f(x) is defined as the integral from 0 to x of sin(1/t) dt. So that's the definition of f.\n2. The integrand sin(1/t) is not continuous at t=0. That's a key point because FTC requires continuity on the interval.\n3. The problem is asking for the derivative at x=0, which is f'(0).\n\nWait, the original problem says \"I need to show that f'(0)=0\". So the problem is to prove that the derivative at 0 is 0. The user is stuck because FTC can't be used here, so they need another method.\n\nSo for the assumptions, each should be a single condition. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt,\nThe integrand sin(1/t) is defined for t ≠ 0,\nsin(1/t) is not continuous at t = 0,\nThe problem requires finding f'(0).\n\nBut wait, the problem statement already includes that f(x) is defined as the integral, so that's the main assumption. The other points are more about the properties of the integrand and the problem's requirement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions here are:\n\n- f is defined by the integral ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt.\n- The function sin(1/t) has a discontinuity at t=0.\n- The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is not applicable here.\n\nBut according to the example given, assumptions are listed as separate points, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt,\nThe function sin(1/t) is not continuous at t = 0,\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus cannot be applied directly at t = 0.\n\nBut maybe the user wants to focus on the problem's given information. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. However, in the original problem provided by the user here, the only explicit assumption is the definition of f(x). The rest are properties or reasons why FTC can't be used. But perhaps the user wants to include those as assumptions since they're necessary for structuring the problem.\n\nWait, the example's formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe the user wants to list all relevant conditions, even if they are part of the problem's given.\n\nIn this case, the problem's given is f(x) = ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt, and the task is to find f'(0). The reason FTC can't be used is because the integrand isn't continuous at 0. So perhaps the assumptions should list:\n\n1. f(x) = ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt.\n2. The function sin(1/t) is discontinuous at t = 0.\n3. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is not applicable at x = 0.\n\nBut maybe the key is to list only the given conditions, not the reasons why methods don't work. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are just the definition of f(x). The rest are part of the problem's context but not explicit assumptions. However, the example included both the variable's domain (n is integer) and a condition on n (divisible by 7). Here, the function's definition is given, and the integrand's behavior is a property that affects the problem. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt,\nThe integrand sin(1/t) is not defined at t = 0,\nsin(1/t) is bounded (since |sin(1/t)| ≤ 1).\n\nWait, but the example didn't include properties like \"n is an integer\" as part of the problem's explicit assumptions. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\". Similarly, the original problem here states \"f(x) = ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt\", so that's an assumption. The fact that sin(1/t) is discontinuous at 0 is a property of the integrand, which is part of the problem's context. So maybe include that as an assumption.\n\nBut the example didn't include properties of the functions unless they were part of the problem's given. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention that n is divisible by 7. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, or perhaps there was a different context. Maybe the example was for a problem where the divisibility by 91 requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. Hmm, perhaps there was a mistake, but regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn this current problem, the original question states: \"I need to show that f'(0)=0 for f(x)=∫₀^x sin(1/t) dt\". The problem is to find f'(0) where FTC doesn't apply. So the key assumptions here are the definition of f(x), and perhaps the properties of the integrand that make FTC inapplicable.\n\nSo following the example's approach, even if the original problem didn't state certain assumptions explicitly, but they are necessary for the problem's context, we include them. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. f(x) is defined as the integral from 0 to x of sin(1/t) dt.\n2. The integrand sin(1/t) is not continuous at t = 0.\n3. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus cannot be applied directly at x = 0.\n\nBut wait, the third point might not be an assumption but a consequence of the second. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions should only include the given information and inherent properties, not the consequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f(x) = ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt.\n- The function sin(1/t) has a discontinuity at t = 0.\n\nBecause those are the inherent properties. The fact that FTC can't be applied is a result of the discontinuity, so it's not an assumption but a conclusion.\n\nIn the example, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That might have been a mistake, but perhaps in the example, the correct assumption should have been that n is an integer, and the problem is to show divisibility by 91 (which factors into 7*13), so maybe the user intended to include divisibility by 7 and 13 as separate assumptions. But in any case, the example's formatted problem includes both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\".\n\nGiven that, perhaps in this problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. f(x) is defined as the integral from 0 to x of sin(1/t) dt.\n2. The integrand sin(1/t) is not defined at t = 0 (since 1/t is undefined there).\n3. The function sin(1/t) is bounded (since sine is always between -1 and 1).\n\nBut I'm not sure. The main issue is that the integrand has an essential discontinuity at t=0, which makes the integral an improper integral at 0. However, since the integral is from 0 to x, and the integrand is sin(1/t) which is bounded, the integral exists as an improper integral. So perhaps another assumption is that the integral converges near t=0.\n\nBut how does the user want this structured? Let's look at the example again. The example's original problem was to show A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem's statement was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example, but perhaps the user intended to structure the problem with necessary conditions. Maybe in reality, the problem requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, hence 91, but the original problem statement didn't specify that, leading to the formatted problem including those assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question doesn't have any additional conditions except f(x) being defined as the integral. The rest are properties of the function. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\n- f(x) = ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt.\n- The integral is considered as an improper integral at t = 0.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention it being an improper integral, but in reality, when integrating up to 0, since sin(1/t) is not defined there, we have to treat it as an improper integral. So that's an implicit assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n1. f(x) is defined by the integral ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt for x ≠ 0, and f(0) = 0.\nWait, but the original problem just says f(x) = ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt. However, technically, when x=0, the integral is 0, so f(0)=0 is part of the definition. But the integrand's behavior near 0 affects the derivative.\n\nBut I think the main points are:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt for all real x,\nThe function sin(1/t) is not continuous at t = 0,\nThe problem requires computing f'(0).\n\nBut perhaps the user wants each assumption on separate lines, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt,\nsin(1/t) is discontinuous at t = 0,\nf'(0) is to be determined.\n\nBut the problem statement is to show f'(0)=0. The problem part would be \"Show that f'(0)=0\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as the integral from 0 to x of sin(1/t) dt,\nThe integrand sin(1/t) has a discontinuity at t = 0,\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is not applicable at x = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f'(0) = 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the third assumption about FTC not being applicable is necessary. The problem statement mentions that FTC is inapplicable, so maybe that's part of the problem's context but not an assumption. Alternatively, the assumptions are only the given conditions, not the consequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only assumption is the definition of f(x), and the rest are part of the problem's context. But in the example, the assumptions included both the variable's domain and an additional condition. Maybe here, the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt,\n- The integrand sin(1/t) is discontinuous at t = 0.\n\nBut the problem is to find f'(0) given that FTC can't be used. So the problem statement is \"Show that f'(0)=0 given that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus cannot be applied.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example had some errors, but following their structure, we need to list each assumption line by line. Let's proceed:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt,\nsin(1/t) is not continuous at t = 0,\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is not applicable at t = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f'(0) = 0.\n\nI think that's acceptable. Each assumption is one line, addressing a single property. The first defines f(x), the second the integrand's discontinuity, and the third the inapplicability of FTC.\n\nAlternatively, the third point might be redundant since it's a consequence of the second. But following the example where the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state it, perhaps here we include all relevant points, even if some are consequences.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as ∫₀ˣ sin(1/t) dt,\nsin(1/t) is discontinuous at t = 0,\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus cannot be directly applied at x = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f'(0) = 0.\n\nYes, this seems to fit the example's structure, where assumptions include both the definition and relevant conditions affecting the approach.",
