    "AcceptedAnswer": "Using Linear Algebra, If the $n+1$ distinct roots are $\\alpha_i$, then we have that $x = [a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n]^{T}$ is a solution of $Ax = 0$ where $A$ is the Vandermonde matrix using the $\\alpha_i$. Since the Vandermonde matrix is invertible for distinct $\\alpha_i$, it follows that $x = [0, 0, \\dots, 0]$. Thus if $a_j \\neq 0$ for some $j$, then your polynomial can have at most $n$ different roots. Note: This is basically saying that given a field $K$, any polynomial of degree $n$ in $K[x]$ has at most $n$ distinct roots. Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is an assertion of the fact that $\\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed, and the $K$ above need not be algebraically closed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know how to prove that a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots, right? So first, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. Let me look at the example again to make sure I'm following correctly.\n\nThe original question is about proving that a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots unless all coefficients are zero. The example provided lists each assumption line by line, focusing on one property per line. \n\nStarting with the assumptions. The polynomial is given as f(x) = sum from k=0 to n of a_k x^k. The user mentions that n is in natural numbers, and the coefficients a_k are complex numbers. Also, the problem states that unless all coefficients are zero, the polynomial can't have more than n roots. Wait, but in the problem statement, they say \"unless all a_0, ..., a_n are zero,\" which would make the polynomial the zero polynomial, which technically has infinitely many roots. So the assumption here is that the polynomial is non-zero, i.e., not all coefficients are zero. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. f(x) is a polynomial of degree n.\n2. The coefficients a_k are complex numbers.\n3. The polynomial is not identically zero (i.e., at least one coefficient is non-zero).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a polynomial function f(x) = sum ... unless all a_0, ..., a_n are zero.\" So the problem is stating that if the polynomial isn't the zero polynomial (so not all coefficients are zero), then it has at most n roots. Therefore, the assumptions should include that f is a polynomial of degree n (so n is the degree), coefficients are complex, and that it's not the zero polynomial. But in the problem statement, the user wrote \"unless all a_0, ..., a_n are zero,\" which is part of the conclusion. Hmm, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) is a polynomial of degree n (so leading coefficient a_n ≠ 0).\n- The coefficients a_k are complex numbers.\n\nBut wait, the degree n is defined as the highest index with a non-zero coefficient. So maybe the problem's assumption is that it's a polynomial of degree exactly n, not less. So the problem's actual setup is that the polynomial is of degree n, which implies that a_n ≠ 0, and other coefficients can be anything. Then the problem is to show that such a polynomial (which is non-zero because a_n ≠ 0) has at most n distinct roots.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement says \"a polynomial function ... is zero for at most n different values of x unless all a_0, ..., a_n are zero.\" So the problem is phrased as: either the polynomial is the zero polynomial (all coefficients zero), which has infinitely many roots, or if it's not the zero polynomial, then it has at most n roots. So the user wants to prove that a non-zero polynomial of degree n has at most n roots. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a polynomial: f(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n2. The coefficients a_k are complex numbers.\n3. n is a natural number.\n4. The polynomial f is not identically zero (i.e., at least one a_k ≠ 0).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"unless all a_0, ..., a_n are zero,\" so maybe the problem is structured as: \"Prove that f has at most n roots unless all coefficients are zero.\" So the problem's conclusion is that either f has infinitely many roots (if it's the zero polynomial) or at most n roots. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem when phrased as \"prove that unless all a_k are zero, f has at most n roots\" would include that f is a polynomial of degree at most n, but when not all coefficients are zero, then it has at most n roots. Wait, but the original question's title is \"How to prove that a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots?\" So perhaps the key assumption is that the polynomial is of degree exactly n, which implies that a_n ≠ 0, hence it's a non-zero polynomial, and thus has at most n roots. But sometimes, the degree can be less than n if the leading coefficients are zero. Wait, the problem statement's definition of the polynomial is sum_{0 ≤ k ≤ n} a_k x^k with n in N and a_k in C. So the polynomial's degree is at most n, unless specified otherwise. But the problem is about a polynomial of degree n, so perhaps the correct assumption is that the polynomial has degree exactly n, which would mean a_n ≠ 0. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"a polynomial of degree n,\" so that's part of the problem's premise.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f(x) is a polynomial of degree n.\n2. The coefficients a_k are complex numbers.\n3. The polynomial f is of the form f(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n4. n is a natural number.\n\nThe problem is to prove that such a polynomial (which is of degree n, hence a_n ≠ 0, so not the zero polynomial) has at most n distinct roots. Alternatively, if the problem allows for the polynomial to be of degree up to n (including lower degrees), then the statement would be that a polynomial of degree at most n has at most n roots. But given the title says \"degree n,\" I think it's the former. However, the problem statement in the question says \"a polynomial function ... is zero for at most n different values of x unless all a_0, ..., a_n are zero.\" So the problem is more general: any polynomial (with coefficients in C) of degree at most n (since the sum goes up to n) will have at most n roots unless it's the zero polynomial. So perhaps the problem is phrased for polynomials of degree at most n, and the conclusion is that such a non-zero polynomial has at most n roots. Therefore, the assumptions would include that the polynomial is of degree at most n (since the sum is up to n), coefficients are complex, and it's not the zero polynomial. But the user's original question is phrased as \"a polynomial of degree n,\" but their own problem statement allows for any sum up to n, which could have degree less than n if leading coefficients are zero. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the original problem statement from the user:\n\n\"How can I prove, that a polynomial function $$f(x) = \\sum_{0\\le k \\le n}a_k x^k\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb N,\\ a_k\\in\\mathbb C$$ is zero for at most $n$ different values of $x$ , unless all $a_0,a_1,\\ldots,a_n$ are zero?\"\n\nSo here, the polynomial is written as sum_{0 ≤ k ≤n} a_k x^k, with n a natural number and a_k in C. So the degree is at most n. The problem is to prove that this polynomial has at most n roots (i.e., is zero for at most n x's) unless all coefficients are zero. So the key here is that the polynomial is either the zero polynomial (all coefficients zero) and has infinitely many roots, or it's a non-zero polynomial of degree at most n, hence has at most n roots.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem should capture that:\n\n1. The polynomial f(x) is defined as f(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n2. The coefficients a_k are complex numbers.\n3. n is a natural number.\n4. The polynomial f is not identically zero (i.e., at least one a_k ≠ 0).\n\nBut the problem statement is to show that \"unless all a_k are zero, f has at most n roots.\" So the problem is to prove that if not all a_k are zero, then f has at most n roots. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include that the polynomial is of the form given, coefficients are complex, n is natural, and the problem is to prove that if it's not the zero polynomial, then it has at most n roots. However, in the example given by the user, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7,\" which was part of the original problem's condition. So in this case, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- The polynomial is defined as sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n- Coefficients are complex numbers.\n- n is a natural number.\n- The polynomial is not identically zero (since the conclusion is \"unless all a_k are zero,\" so the case where it is identically zero is excluded).\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the user is asking to prove that the polynomial has at most n roots unless it's the zero polynomial. Therefore, the problem is structured as: Given a polynomial of the form sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k with complex coefficients and n natural, prove that if not all a_k are zero, then f(x) has at most n distinct roots. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f(x) is a polynomial defined as f(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n2. Each coefficient a_k is a complex number.\n3. n is a natural number.\n4. Not all coefficients a_0, a_1, ..., a_n are zero.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that under these conditions, f(x) has at most n distinct roots. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions listed were specific to the problem. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single property applied to one object.\n\nIn this case, for the polynomial problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) is a polynomial of degree at most n.\n- The coefficients a_k are complex numbers.\n- n is a natural number.\n- The polynomial f is not identically zero.\n\nBut the problem statement in the user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" each as separate lines. So here, each assumption should be listed line by line. Let's parse the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\nProve that a polynomial function $$f(x) = \\sum_{0\\le k \\le n}a_k x^k\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb N,\\ a_k\\in\\mathbb C$$ is zero for at most $n$ different values of $x$, unless all $a_0,a_1,\\ldots,a_n$ are zero.\n\nSo the conditions given are:\n\n- n is in N (natural numbers).\n- a_k are in C (complex numbers).\n- The polynomial is written as sum_{0 ≤k ≤n} a_k x^k.\n\nThe problem is to prove that either all a_k are zero (in which case, it's the zero polynomial), or else the polynomial has at most n distinct roots.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should capture:\n\n1. f(x) is defined as the sum from k=0 to n of a_k x^k.\n2. Each a_k is a complex number.\n3. n is a natural number.\n4. The polynomial f is not identically zero (i.e., not all a_k are zero).\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the \"unless\" clause is part of the conclusion. So the problem is to show that \"the polynomial has at most n roots unless all coefficients are zero.\" Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions leading to the conclusion, excluding the \"unless\" part. In other words, the problem is to prove that if the polynomial is not identically zero (i.e., not all coefficients zero), then it has at most n roots. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions under which the conclusion holds, which are:\n\n1. f(x) is a polynomial of the form sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n2. The coefficients a_k are complex numbers.\n3. n is a natural number.\n4. Not all coefficients a_k are zero.\n\nBut the user's example didn't include the \"unless\" part in the assumptions but included specific conditions. For example, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f(x) is a polynomial of the form sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n2. Each coefficient a_k is a complex number.\n3. n is a natural number.\n4. Not all coefficients a_0, a_1, ..., a_n are zero.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\n- The polynomial f(x) is defined as f(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n- Each coefficient a_k is a complex number.\n- n is a natural number.\n- At least one coefficient a_k is non-zero.\n\nBut the first assumption defines the polynomial's form. The second addresses the coefficients' nature. The third is about n. The fourth is the condition that it's not the zero polynomial.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is a polynomial defined as $$f(x) = \\sum_{0 \\le k \\le n} a_k x^k$$,\nEach coefficient $a_k$ is a complex number,\n$n$ is a natural number,\nAt least one coefficient $a_k$ is non-zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x)$ is zero for at most $n$ different values of $x$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"unless all a_0,...,a_n are zero,\" so the problem is to prove that either it's the zero polynomial (all coefficients zero) or it has at most n roots. But in the formatted problem, the user's example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under the assumptions. So in this case, the formatted problem would be under the assumptions that f is a non-zero polynomial of the given form, and the problem is to prove it has at most n roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions don't include the \"not all coefficients zero\" part, and the problem is stated as \"Prove that the polynomial is zero for at most n different x unless all coefficients are zero.\" But according to the user's example, they extracted assumptions from the problem statement. The original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which were part of the problem's conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the conditions are:\n\n- f(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n- n is a natural number.\n- a_k are complex numbers.\n\nThe conclusion is that f(x) has at most n roots unless all a_k are zero. Therefore, the problem is to prove that given the above conditions, either f is identically zero or has at most n roots. However, in the format, the problem part should state the actual claim to be proven, which is \"Prove that the polynomial is zero for at most n different values of x unless all coefficients are zero.\" But perhaps in the formatted problem, the \"unless\" part is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions.\n\nLooking back at the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, given n is integer and divisible by 7. The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7,\" and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSimilarly, here, the original problem's conditions are that f is a polynomial of that form with complex coefficients, n is natural, and the problem is to prove that unless all coefficients are zero, f has at most n roots. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f(x) is defined as sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n2. Each a_k is a complex number.\n3. n is a natural number.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the polynomial is zero for at most n different x unless all a_k are zero.\n\nBut the user's example included the divisibility condition in the assumptions. So in this case, the \"unless\" part is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. So the formatted problem would list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is a polynomial defined as $$f(x) = \\sum_{0 \\le k \\le n} a_k x^k$$,\nEach coefficient $a_k$ is a complex number,\n$n$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x)$ is zero for at most $n$ different values of $x$, unless all coefficients $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ are zero.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem part is concise. In their example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91,\" with the assumptions listed separately. So perhaps here, the problem is to prove that the polynomial has at most n roots, with the assumptions being the polynomial's form, coefficients in C, n in N. The \"unless\" part is part of the problem statement. However, in the user's example, the \"unless\" part was not in the problem statement but in the assumptions. Wait no: in the example, the original problem had \"A(n) is divisible by 91,\" and the formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 under those assumptions.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"unless\" clause in the current problem is part of the conclusion, so the problem is stated as \"Prove that the polynomial is zero for at most n different x unless all coefficients are zero,\" and the assumptions are the polynomial's structure, coefficients in C, n in N.\n\nTherefore, following the user's example, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x)$ is a polynomial defined as $$f(x) = \\sum_{0 \\le k \\le n} a_k x^k$$,\nEach coefficient $a_k$ is a complex number,\n$n$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x)$ is zero for at most $n$ different values of $x$, unless all coefficients $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ are zero.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem part should encapsulate the actual claim. In their example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove the polynomial has at most n roots unless it's zero. But the user's example didn't include the \"unless\" in the problem statement but instead structured the assumptions to include the conditions. Wait no, in their example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions included that n is integer and divisible by 7. The problem part was just \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the problem is to prove that f(x) has at most n roots unless all coefficients are zero. But perhaps the way to structure it is:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x)$ is a polynomial defined as $$f(x) = \\sum_{0 \\le k \\le n} a_k x^k$$,\nEach coefficient $a_k$ is a complex number,\n$n$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x)$ is zero for at most $n$ different values of $x$ unless all coefficients $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ are zero.\n\nBut in the user's example, the assumption included specific conditions (n divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the problem includes an \"unless\" clause. However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem as in the example, which had the problem part as a single statement without an \"unless\" clause. Wait, the example's original problem had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" with the assumption that n is divisible by 7. The \"unless\" part here is different. Maybe the correct way is to have the problem statement as \"Prove that f(x) is zero for at most n different values of x,\" with the assumptions including that not all coefficients are zero. But the original problem includes the \"unless\" in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"unless\" part is part of the problem's conclusion, so the problem is to prove that either f is the zero polynomial or it has at most n roots. So the problem would be phrased as: \"Prove that f(x) is zero for at most n different values of x unless all coefficients are zero.\"\n\nBut the user's example did not have an unless clause in the problem statement. It was a direct statement. Therefore, maybe we need to rephrase the problem as \"Prove that the polynomial f(x) has at most n distinct roots,\" with the assumptions including that it's not the zero polynomial.\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"How to prove that a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots?\" which suggests that the degree is exactly n, but the problem statement allows for degree up to n. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to note that a polynomial of degree n (exactly) has at most n roots. But the problem as stated in the question allows for polynomials of degree up to n (since the sum is up to n). Therefore, the problem is more general: any polynomial of degree at most n (with complex coefficients) has at most n roots, unless it's the zero polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f(x) is a polynomial of degree at most n.\n2. The coefficients a_k are complex numbers.\n3. n is a natural number.\n4. The polynomial f is not identically zero.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, f has at most n roots.\n\nAlternatively, to follow the example's structure, where assumptions are listed and the problem is the direct statement. So, considering the original problem's phrasing, the formatted problem should have assumptions extracted from the problem's given conditions, and the problem part is the actual claim.\n\nIn the user's example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem part was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nSimilarly, here, the original problem's conditions are that f is a polynomial of the form sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k with n in N and a_k in C. The problem is to prove that such a polynomial has at most n roots unless all coefficients are zero. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f(x) is defined as sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k.\n2. Each a_k is a complex number.\n3. n is a natural number.\n\nThe problem part is: Prove that f(x) is zero for at most n different values of x unless all coefficients are zero.\n\nBut the user's example didn't have an \"unless\" clause in the problem part. However, in this case, the problem statement naturally includes that clause. So perhaps it's acceptable here. Alternatively, if the problem is to be phrased without the \"unless,\" then the assumptions would include that the polynomial is non-zero, and the problem is to prove it has at most n roots. But the original problem includes the \"unless\" in the problem statement. Therefore, following the user's example, we should structure the problem as they have, which includes the \"unless\" in the problem part.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f(x)$ is defined as a polynomial $$f(x) = \\sum_{0 \\le k \\le n} a_k x^k$$,\nEach coefficient $a_k$ is a complex number,\n$n$ is a natural number.\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x)$ is zero for at most $n$ different values of $x$, unless all coefficients $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ are zero.\n###",
