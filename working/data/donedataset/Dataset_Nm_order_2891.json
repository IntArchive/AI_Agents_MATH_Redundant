    "AcceptedAnswer": "Idea: Show that $Q$ is sequentially compact using a diagonalization procedure. Let $(x^k)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\subseteq Q$ be a sequence of the form $$x^k = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n^k u_n$$ with $|c_n^k| \\leq \\frac{1}{n}$. Since $(c_1^k)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\subseteq B[0,1]$ and $B[0,1]$ is compact, we can pick a subsquence $k^1(j)$ such that $c_1^{k^1(j)} \\to c_1 \\in B[0,1]$ as $j \\to \\infty$. Iterating this procedure, we can find a subsequence $(k^{\\ell}(j))_j$ of $(k^{\\ell-1}(j))_j$ such that $$c_n^{k^{\\ell}(j)} \\stackrel{j \\to \\infty}{\\to} c_n \\in B \\left[0, \\frac{1}{n} \\right] \\tag{1}$$ for all $n \\leq \\ell$. Claim : $(x^{k^j(j)})_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $x := \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n u_n.$ Proof: For $\\varepsilon>0$ (fixed), choose $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $$\\sum_{n >N} \\frac{1}{n^2} \\leq \\varepsilon.$$ Then $$\\begin{align*} \\|x^{k^j(j)}-x\\|^2 &= \\sum_{n=1}^{N} |c_n^{k^{j}(j)}-c_n|^2 + \\sum_{n=N+1}^{\\infty} |c_n^{k^{j}(j)}-c_n|^2 \\\\ &\\leq  \\sum_{n=1}^{N} |c_n^{k^{j}(j)}-c_n|^2  + 4 \\varepsilon. \\end{align*}$$ Recall that $c_n^{k^j(j)}$ is a subsequence of $c_n^{k^N(j)}$ for $j \\geq N$. As, by $(1)$, $$c_n^{k^N(j)} \\to c_n$$ for any $n \\leq N$, this means that we can choose $M(n)$ such that $$|c_n^{k^j(j)}-c_n|^2 \\leq \\frac{\\varepsilon}{N}$$ for all $j \\geq M(n)$. Setting $M := \\max\\{M(1),\\ldots,M(N)\\}$, we get for $j \\geq M$ $$ \\|x^{k^j(j)}-x\\|^2 \\leq 5 \\varepsilon.$$ Remark: $B[z,r] \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}$ denotes the closed ball of radius $r$  centered at $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Hilbert cube is compact\". The user asks: Let {u_n}_{n∈ℕ} be an orthonormal set in H (Hilbert space). How to prove that the set Q = {x ∈ H : x = ∑_{i=1}^∞ c_n u_n, where |c_n| ≤ 1/n} is compact? H is a Hilbert space over the complex numbers, c_n ∈ ℂ. Thanks for any suggestion.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the question for these elements.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. H is a Hilbert space over the complex numbers.\n2. {u_n}_{n∈ℕ} is an orthonormal set in H.\n3. Q is defined as the set of all x in H such that x = ∑_{i=1}^∞ c_n u_n (note: the index in the sum is i, but the coefficients are c_n; this might be a typo, but I should stick to the original notation as given).\n4. For each c_n, |c_n| ≤ 1/n.\n5. The coefficients c_n are elements of ℂ.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"x = sum_{i=1}^∞ {c_n u_n}\". The index in the summation is i, but inside the sum, it's c_n u_n. That seems inconsistent. Maybe it's a typo, and the user meant c_i u_i? Because otherwise, the summation index i is not used in the terms. That's likely a mistake. However, since I need to structure the problem as given, perhaps I should note that. But the user might have intended c_i u_i. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"x = sum_{i=1}^∞{c_n u_n}, where |c_n| ≤ 1/n\". Hmm, maybe the user intended the coefficients to be c_i, but wrote c_n. Because if the summation index is i, then c_n would be fixed for each n, but in the sum, we have terms over i. That doesn't make sense. So this is probably a typo. However, since the user wrote it that way, I should either correct it or note it. But since the task is to structure the problem as given, perhaps I should keep the original notation. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says \"c_n ∈ ℂ\". So each c_n is a coefficient, but the sum is over i=1 to ∞ of c_n u_n. That's conflicting. The index in the sum is i, but the terms inside are c_n and u_n, which are dependent on n, not i. That must be an error. So, as a knowledgeable professor, I should recognize that this is likely a typo and the correct expression should be sum_{n=1}^∞ c_n u_n, with |c_n| ≤ 1/n. Because otherwise, the sum as written doesn't make sense. Therefore, I will assume that the user intended to write the sum over n, and the coefficients c_n with |c_n| ≤ 1/n. Therefore, the correct assumption would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the set Q = {x ∈ H : x = ∑_{n=1}^∞ c_n u_n, where |c_n| ≤ 1/n for each n} is compact.\n\nBut since the original problem has the sum over i, maybe I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe the user mixed up indices. Let's see: \"x = sum_{i=1}^∞{c_n u_n}\". If the summation index is i, then each term should be c_i u_i. Otherwise, if it's c_n u_n, then n is fixed, but the sum is over i, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, this is likely a typo. Since the user is asking for help, and the correct problem would have the sum over n, I think it's safe to correct that typo when structuring the problem. But the task is to structure the problem as given. Hmm, the user's original problem has the sum over i, but uses c_n and u_n. That's inconsistent. However, given that {u_n} is the orthonormal set, it's standard to index them by n. So the sum should be over n, not i. Therefore, the correct sum is over n=1 to ∞ of c_n u_n. So the user probably made a typo in the summation index. Therefore, when structuring the problem, I should correct that to sum_{n=1}^∞ c_n u_n. But since the original problem says sum_{i=1}^∞, I need to decide whether to keep it as is or correct it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant that the coefficients are c_i, but wrote c_n. For example, the problem could be: x = sum_{i=1}^∞ c_i u_i, with |c_i| ≤ 1/i. That would make sense. Because then each term in the sum is c_i u_i, with |c_i| ≤ 1/i. So the coefficients decay as 1/i. So the typo is that the user wrote c_n instead of c_i. Therefore, the correct assumption is that for each i, |c_i| ≤ 1/i. So in that case, the problem should be x = sum_{i=1}^∞ c_i u_i, |c_i| ≤ 1/i.\n\nBut given that the user wrote \"c_n ∈ ℂ\", maybe they meant that each coefficient is c_n with |c_n| ≤1/n, and the sum is over n. Therefore, the sum is ∑_{n=1}^∞ c_n u_n. However, in the original problem, the summation variable is i. So there's a conflict. To resolve this, as a professor, I need to make sense of the problem. The most reasonable interpretation is that the summation index is n, and the coefficients are c_n with |c_n| ≤1/n. Therefore, the correct sum is ∑_{n=1}^∞ c_n u_n. Therefore, the user likely mistyped the summation index as i instead of n. Therefore, when structuring the problem, I should correct that typo to make the problem well-defined.\n\nAlternatively, if I keep the summation index as i, then the coefficients should be c_i with |c_i| ≤1/i. The user wrote c_n, which would be a single coefficient, but the sum is over i. That doesn't make sense. So either way, there's a typo. Given that, I think the intended problem is the Hilbert cube defined as the set of all x in H such that x = ∑_{n=1}^∞ c_n u_n with |c_n| ≤1/n. Therefore, I will adjust the summation index to n in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. H is a Hilbert space over the complex numbers.\n2. {u_n}_{n∈ℕ} is an orthonormal set in H.\n3. Q is the set of all x in H such that x = ∑_{n=1}^∞ c_n u_n.\n4. For each n ∈ ℕ, |c_n| ≤ 1/n.\n5. c_n ∈ ℂ for each n ∈ ℕ.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions that H is over the complex numbers and c_n are in ℂ, so those are important assumptions.\n\nNow, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Hilbert space over the complex numbers,\n{u_n}_{n∈ℕ} is an orthonormal set in H,\nFor each n ∈ ℕ, c_n is a complex number with |c_n| ≤ 1/n,\nQ is the set of all x ∈ H such that x = ∑_{n=1}^∞ c_n u_n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Q is compact.\n\nWait, but the original problem states Q as x = sum_{i=1}^∞ c_n u_n, which we corrected to n. Also, the user wrote \"c_n ∈ ℂ\", so that's another assumption. Each coefficient is a complex number bounded by 1/n.\n\nSo each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Hilbert space over the complex numbers,\n{u_n}_{n∈ℕ} is an orthonormal set in H,\nEach c_n is a complex number,\nFor each n ∈ ℕ, |c_n| ≤ 1/n,\nQ is the set of all x ∈ H such that x = ∑_{n=1}^∞ c_n u_n.\n\nBut the original problem says \"c_n ∈ ℂ\", so that's an assumption. Also, the sum is over i=1 to infinity but uses c_n u_n. As discussed, that's likely a typo, so corrected to n=1 to infinity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nH is a Hilbert space over the complex numbers,\n$\\{u_n\\}_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is an orthonormal set in $H$,\nEach $c_n$ is a complex number,\nFor each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $|c_n| \\leq \\frac{1}{n}$,\n$Q$ is the set of all $x \\in H$ such that $x = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n u_n$.\nProblem:\nProve that $Q$ is compact.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumptions were more succinct. Let's check the example again.\n\nOriginal example's assumptions:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption is a single line, each addressing one condition. In the current problem, \"Each $c_n$ is a complex number\" and \"For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $|c_n| \\leq \\frac{1}{n}\" are separate conditions. Similarly, H being a Hilbert space over complex numbers is one assumption.\n\nBut perhaps \"c_n ∈ ℂ\" can be combined with the |c_n| ≤1/n? Or should they be separate? The example had two separate lines for n being integer and n divisible by 7, even though both apply to n. Therefore, following that pattern, each condition on the same object should be separate lines.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\n$H$ is a Hilbert space over the complex numbers,\n$\\{u_n\\}_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is an orthonormal set in $H$,\nFor each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $c_n$ is a complex number,\nFor each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $|c_n| \\leq \\frac{1}{n}$,\n$Q$ is defined as $Q = \\left\\{ x \\in H : x = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n u_n \\right\\}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $Q$ is compact.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a single line, each applying to one object or condition. The orthonormal set, the Hilbert space, each c_n being complex, each c_n bounded by 1/n, and Q's definition.\n\nI think that's the proper structure. The key is to list each condition separately, even if they apply to the same object (like c_n has two conditions: being complex and bounded by 1/n). The example showed that separate conditions on the same object (n being integer and divisible by 7) are listed separately. Therefore, following that, this is correct.",
