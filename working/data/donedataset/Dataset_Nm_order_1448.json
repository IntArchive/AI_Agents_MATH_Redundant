    "Content": "I don't remember in which topic I found it but I know it was there. And I still have not find a proof of this nice approximation. Let $x$ be a non perfect square number. If $y$ is the closer perfect square to $x$ such that $y < x$ then $$\\sqrt{x}\\approx \\sqrt{y}+\\frac{x-y}{2\\cdot \\sqrt{y}}$$ And it gives at the maximum two correct decimals after the decimal point. My first reaction to try to find from where this formula goes, was to expand it, I found $$2\\sqrt{xy}\\approx y +\\sqrt{2y}\\cdot(x-y)$$ and I tried to find a remarkable identity but I failed and I'm still stuck there. Also I don't know how should I prove the maximum of two correct digits after the comma. If we look for example to the sqare root time of $1000$ , $961$ is the closer perfect square which verifies the condition. Then we have $\\sqrt{1000} \\approx 31 + \\frac{39}{2*31} = 31.62903...$ and with a calculator we have $\\sqrt{1000} = 31.6227766017...$ which is quite good. Any hints would be appreciate, thank you in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We may as well suppose that $y_0^2 < x < (y_0+1)^2$ for some integer $y_0$. It isn't that hard to show that $y_0 < \\sqrt x < \\dfrac {x}{y_0} < y_0+1$.\nSo we can replace $\\sqrt x \\in (y_0, y_0+1)$ \nwith $\\sqrt x \\in \\left(y_0, \\dfrac {x}{y_0} \\right)$. \nWhich is a smaller interval. Your algorithm chooses the next approximation,\n$y_1$, to be the midpoint of that interval, \n$y_1 = \\dfrac 12 \\left( y_0 +\\dfrac {x}{y_0} \\right)\n     = y_0 - \\dfrac 12 \\left( y_0 -\\dfrac {x}{y_0} \\right)\n     = y_0 - \\dfrac{y_0^2 - x}{2y_0}$ Define $y_{n+1} = \\dfrac 12 \\left( y_n +\\dfrac {x}{y_n} \\right)\n                = y_n - \\dfrac{y_n^2 - x}{2y_n}$ It can be shown that \n$y_0 < y_2 < y_4 \\cdots < \\sqrt x < \\cdots < y_5 < y_3 < y_1$ and that\n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}y_n = \\sqrt x$. Your question is about how fast the sequence \n$\\{ y_n \\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ converges to $\\sqrt x$. In particular, we find that \\begin{align}\n    \\dfrac{|y_{n+1} - \\sqrt x|}{|y_n - \\sqrt x|^2}\n    &= \\dfrac\n    {\\left|\\dfrac 12\\left(y_n+\\dfrac{x}{y_n}\\right)-\\sqrt x \\right|}\n    {|y_n - \\sqrt x|^2}\\\\\n    &= \\dfrac\n    {|y_n^2 + x- 2y_n\\sqrt x|}\n    {2y_n|y_n^2 - 2y_n\\sqrt x + x|}\\\\\n    &= \\dfrac{1}{2y_n}\n\\end{align} Which we can interpret as \n$|y_{n+1} - \\sqrt x| \\approx \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt x} |y_n - \\sqrt x|^2$ So if the error of the $n^{th}$ approximation is on the order of $10^{-m}$, then the error of the $(n+1)^{th}$ approximation will be on the order of $10^{-2m}$. In practical terms, the number of correct digits (approximately) doubles. This statement seems to be true for all $x >> 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem step by step. The user is asking about an approximation formula for the square root of a non-perfect square number. The formula given is:\n\nIf \\( y \\) is the closest perfect square less than \\( x \\), then \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\).\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement as per the required format. Let me start by listing the assumptions.\n\nThe problem states that \\( x \\) is a non-perfect square. So that's one assumption. Then, \\( y \\) is defined as the closest perfect square to \\( x \\) such that \\( y < x \\). That's another assumption—since \\( y \\) must be a perfect square, less than \\( x \\), and the closest one. The user also mentions that the approximation gives a maximum of two correct decimal places, which might be part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. \n\nWait, the example provided in the original question mentions that the formula should be proven to approximate with at most two correct decimal digits. So, the problem is to prove both the validity of the approximation formula and the accuracy of up to two decimal places. \n\nBut in the example format given earlier, the assumptions are about the conditions given in the problem. The problem statement itself is what needs to be proven. So, in this case, the assumptions would include:\n\n1. \\( x \\) is a non-perfect square number.\n2. \\( y \\) is a perfect square.\n3. \\( y \\) is the closest perfect square to \\( x \\) such that \\( y < x \\).\n\nThe problem then is to prove that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) provides an approximation with a maximum error of two correct decimal places.\n\nWait, but the user's original problem also mentions showing the formula is true, not just the accuracy. So maybe the main problem is to prove the formula's validity as an approximation, and the accuracy part is a secondary claim that needs proof as well.\n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions included that \\( n \\) is an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the assumptions are the conditions given, and the problem is what needs to be proven.\n\nSo applying that here, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. The problem is to show the formula is correct (i.e., that the approximation holds) and that it gives up to two correct decimal digits.\n\nBut perhaps the accuracy part is part of the problem statement. The user says, \"And it gives at the maximum two correct decimals after the decimal point.\" So that is part of what needs to be proven.\n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\( x \\) is a non-perfect square number.\n- \\( y \\) is a perfect square.\n- \\( y \\) is the closest perfect square to \\( x \\).\n- \\( y < x \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) provides an approximation accurate to a maximum of two correct decimal places.\n\nBut wait, the user's question is \"How to show this formula... is true?\" So the main problem is to prove the formula, and the accuracy is part of that proof.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the approximation formula is valid, and the accuracy (two decimals) is a property to be established.\n\nNow, the original question's title is about showing the formula is true, and the body mentions wanting a proof and also the part about two correct decimals. So the problem is to prove the formula's validity and the accuracy.\n\nBut in the example given, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with assumptions about n being integer and divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions are the conditions given (x is non-perfect square, y is closest perfect square less than x), and the problem is to prove the approximation formula holds with the stated accuracy.\n\nBut maybe the accuracy is part of the problem statement. Let me re-examine the original question:\n\n\"And it gives at the maximum two correct decimals after the decimal point.\" So the problem is two-fold: show the formula is a good approximation (i.e., derive why \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + (x - y)/(2\\sqrt{y}) \\)), and then show that the error is such that it gives at most two correct decimal digits.\n\nBut perhaps the problem as stated in the user's question is to show the formula is true (i.e., derive it) and that the approximation is accurate up to two decimal places.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( x \\) is a non-perfect square.\n- \\( y \\) is the closest perfect square to \\( x \\) with \\( y < x \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) is accurate to a maximum of two correct decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be split into two parts: first proving the formula, then proving the accuracy. But according to the user's example, the problem statement is concise. The example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n.\n\nSo here, the problem is to prove that the given approximation formula is valid (true), and that it's accurate up to two decimal places. However, in the example, the problem was a single statement. Maybe the user's problem is to prove the formula's validity, and the accuracy is part of that proof.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show the formula is a valid approximation (i.e., derive it) and that its error is bounded such that it gives up to two correct decimals.\n\nBut how to structure this? The user wants the problem part to be the exact question to answer.\n\nLooking back at the user's original question: \"How to show this formula to get a square root of a number in 'just few seconds' is true?\" So the main problem is to prove the formula is correct. The part about two decimals is a claim about its accuracy that needs proof.\n\nBut in the problem formatting, perhaps the problem is \"Prove that the approximation formula [...] is accurate to within two decimal places.\" But the user's own example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as stated in the user's title: \"How to show this formula [...] is true?\" But the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\".\n\nGiven the example, the problem should be a statement to prove. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that for a non-perfect square \\( x \\) with closest smaller perfect square \\( y \\), the approximation \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) is accurate to within two decimal places.\n\nBut perhaps the user's original problem is to prove the formula itself, regardless of the accuracy. The user says, \"I found [...] and I tried to find a remarkable identity but I failed and I'm still stuck there. Also I don't know how should I prove the maximum of two correct digits after the comma.\"\n\nSo two parts: 1) Prove the approximation formula. 2) Prove the maximum error is two decimal places.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be a single statement. The user's example had the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So maybe here, the problem is \"Prove that the approximation formula [...] is true and provides up to two correct decimal places.\"\n\nBut perhaps the problem is just to prove the formula is a valid approximation (derivation), and the accuracy is a separate part. However, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were two: n is integer, and n is divisible by 7. The problem was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nSo here, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x such that y < x.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) is accurate to within two decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to show that the formula holds (i.e., derive it) and that its error is bounded to two decimal places. But how to phrase that concisely.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"How to show this formula [...] is true?\" So the main task is to prove the formula is correct. The accuracy of two decimals is a property of the formula that the user wants to establish. So perhaps the problem is two parts: 1) Derive the approximation formula. 2) Show its accuracy.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be a single statement. So perhaps the problem is to prove that the given approximation formula for \\( \\sqrt{x} \\) is valid and has an error of at most two decimal places.\n\nBut maybe the problem is simply to prove the formula is a valid approximation, and the accuracy part is part of that proof. Alternatively, the problem as stated by the user is to prove the formula (i.e., why it works) and also prove the error bound.\n\nHowever, in the example, only the divisibility was the problem, with assumptions. So perhaps here, the problem is to prove the approximation formula, with the given assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove that the approximation formula approximates \\( \\sqrt{x} \\) with a maximum error of two decimal places.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7.\n\nIn this case, the problem is similar: Given x is a non-perfect square, y is the closest perfect square less than x, prove that the given expression approximates sqrt(x) with up to two correct decimals.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- \\( x \\) is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- \\( y \\) is a perfect square.\n\n- \\( y \\) is the closest perfect square to \\( x \\).\n\n- \\( y < x \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) yields an approximation with at most two correct decimal places.\n\nBut maybe some of these assumptions can be combined. Wait, the example had each assumption as one line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nIn the example:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$n$ is an integer,\n\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line. Here, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- \\( x \\) is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- \\( y \\) is a perfect square.\n\n- \\( y \\) is the closest perfect square to \\( x \\).\n\n- \\( y < x \\).\n\nBut wait, the user says \"Let \\( x \\) be a non perfect square number. If \\( y \\) is the closer perfect square to \\( x \\) such that \\( y < x \\) then [...]\".\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n1. x is a non-perfect square.\n\n2. y is a perfect square.\n\n3. y is the closest perfect square to x.\n\n4. y < x.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each applying to one object. So x is non-perfect square, y is perfect square, y is closest to x, and y is less than x.\n\nBut wait, \"y is the closer perfect square to x such that y < x\" can be split into two parts: y is a perfect square, y is the closest to x among those perfect squares less than x.\n\nBut maybe the user's original problem's assumptions are:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x with y < x.\n\nBut \"y is the closest perfect square to x with y < x\" combines two conditions: y is a perfect square, y < x, and y is the closest such perfect square to x.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, breaking down:\n\n1. x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n2. y is a perfect square.\n\n3. y is less than x.\n\n4. y is the closest perfect square to x (among those less than x).\n\nBut perhaps the fourth point is redundant once we have 3 and y is the closest. Alternatively, maybe it's better to list:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x with y < x.\n\nBut this third assumption combines multiple conditions. However, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions.\n\nSo in this case, the third assumption is a single condition: y is the closest perfect square to x such that y < x.\n\nBut maybe that's a single condition. Alternatively, it's a combination of y being a perfect square, y < x, and y is the closest. But according to the example's format, each assumption is one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y < x.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x.\n\nBut the last two are separate conditions on y. However, the \"closest\" might imply y < x, but the user specified \"such that y < x\". So perhaps \"y is the closest perfect square to x with y < x\" is a single assumption.\n\nBut the example had two separate assumptions for n: integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, for y:\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y < x.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x (among those less than x).\n\nBut maybe that's over-splitting. Alternatively, \"y is the closest perfect square to x less than x\" is a single condition. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x with y < x.\n\nBut that's combining multiple conditions. However, according to the user's example, each assumption is a separate line. For example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate lines.\n\nTherefore, here, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y is less than x.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x.\n\nBut the last one may not be necessary if y is defined as the closest. Wait, the original problem states \"If y is the closer perfect square to x such that y < x then [...]\". So the user defines y under these conditions. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x.\n\n- y < x.\n\nBut \"closest\" could be ambiguous unless specified as the closest from below. However, the original problem says \"such that y < x\". So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y < x.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x among those less than x.\n\nBut again, this is splitting into multiple conditions. Alternatively, \"y is the closest perfect square to x with y < x\" is a single assumption.\n\nBut given the example, each assumption is a separate line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y < x.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x.\n\nBut if y is the closest perfect square to x, but y < x, then that's a condition. However, without loss of generality, if x is not a perfect square, the closest perfect square could be either above or below. But the problem specifies y < x, so y is the closest from below.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem statement, y is defined as the closest perfect square less than x. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square less than x.\n\nBut this is two assumptions. However, \"y is the closest perfect square less than x\" combines multiple conditions (y is perfect square, y < x, and closest). But according to the example, each assumption is a single condition. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y is less than x.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x among those less than x.\n\nBut this seems too granular. However, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So following that pattern, the assumptions here should list each condition separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem defines y as the closest perfect square less than x, which is a single condition. However, to split into assumptions:\n\n1. x is a non-perfect square.\n\n2. y is a perfect square.\n\n3. y is the closest to x among all perfect squares less than x.\n\nBut \"closest to x\" is a condition on y. So three assumptions.\n\nBut maybe in the context of the problem, y is given as the closest perfect square less than x, so it's a single assumption. However, to adhere to the example's format where each assumption is one property, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y < x.\n\n- Among all perfect squares less than x, y is the closest to x.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) yields an approximation accurate to two decimal places at maximum.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem as a single statement. So perhaps the problem here is to prove that the given formula approximates sqrt(x) with up to two correct decimal places, given the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the validity of the formula (why it approximates sqrt(x)) and the accuracy. But according to the example, the problem is to prove a specific statement.\n\nThe user's example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem would be \"Prove that the approximation formula [...] is accurate to two decimal places.\"\n\nBut in the user's original question, they want to prove the formula is true (i.e., derive it) and that it's accurate. However, the example format requires the problem to be a statement to prove. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that the approximation \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) holds and provides up to two correct decimal places.\n\nBut maybe the problem is just to prove the approximation formula is valid, and the accuracy is part of that proof.\n\nAlternatively, given that the user's main question is about showing the formula is true, the problem is to derive/prove the formula, and the accuracy is a separate part. However, the example shows that the problem is a single statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to prove the formula's validity (i.e., why it approximates sqrt(x)) and the accuracy follows from that proof.\n\nIn any case, based on the original problem and the example, the formatted problem should have assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one condition, and the problem is the main statement to prove.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x such that y < x.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) is accurate to within two decimal places.\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem says \"it gives at the maximum two correct decimals after the decimal point.\" So the problem is to show the formula is a good approximation (true) and that the error is limited to two decimal places. But how to phrase this as a single problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to show that the formula is a valid approximation of sqrt(x), with an error no more than 0.005 (so that the first two decimals are correct). But the user's example just says \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nIn this case, perhaps the problem is to prove that the given formula approximates sqrt(x), given the assumptions, and that the error is such that the first two decimal places are correct.\n\nBut I think the main point is to follow the structure: list all assumptions line by line, each being a single condition, then state the problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a non-perfect square number.\n\n- y is a perfect square.\n\n- y is the closest perfect square to x.\n\n- y < x.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) is valid and provides up to two correct decimal places.\n\nBut perhaps the validity of the formula is part of the problem. However, the user's example had the problem as a single statement. So here, the problem is to prove the formula is valid (i.e., approximates sqrt(x)) and that the error is bounded to two decimal places. But how to phrase it concisely.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove that the formula approximates sqrt(x) with an error of less than 0.005, ensuring two correct decimals.\n\nBut the user's example just had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" So similarly, here the problem is \"Prove that the approximation formula [...] is accurate to two decimal places.\"\n\nHowever, the formula's derivation is part of proving its validity. So perhaps the problem is to derive the formula and show its accuracy.\n\nBut in academic terms, the problem is to show that the given approximation holds with the stated accuracy. Therefore, the problem statement would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that for a non-perfect square number \\( x \\) with closest smaller perfect square \\( y \\), the approximation \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) yields a result accurate to two decimal places.\n\nThus, after this analysis, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nx is a non-perfect square number,\ny is a perfect square,\ny is the closest perfect square to x,\ny < x.\nProblem:\nProve that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x - y}{2 \\sqrt{y}} \\) is accurate to two decimal places.",
