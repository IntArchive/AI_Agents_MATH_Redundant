    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can do it using the Pythagorean theorem. I'll treat the case in which $\\angle (a,b)$ and $\\angle(a,c)$ are both acute and $m \\gt n$ as in your figure. Draw the height $h$ of the triangle $abc$ and denote the resulting middle segment on $a$ by $x$ . Using the Pythagorean theorem one sees $$\\begin{align*}\nb^2 &= h^2 + (n+x)^2 \\\\\nc^2 &= h^2 + (m-x)^2 \\\\\nd^2 &= h^2 + x^2\n\\end{align*}$$ Therefore $$\\begin{align*}\nb^2 m &= h^2m + n^2m + 2mnx+x^2m \\\\\nc^2 n &= h^2n + m^2n - 2mnx + x^2n \\\\\nb^2 m + c^2n &= (n+m)(h^2  + mn + x^2) = a(d^2 + mn)\n\\end{align*}$$ as we wanted. If $\\angle(a,c)$ is obtuse, the same idea works: Write $$b^2 = (m+n+x)^2 + h^2, \\qquad c^2 = x^2 + h^2, \\qquad d^2 = (m+x)^2 + h^2$$ and calculate similarly. Symmetry and the consideration of some degenerate cases easily lead to a complete proof of Stewart's theorem from what I've written here. It would be very nice to have a good pictorial proof that makes the identity similarly obvious as Pythagoras, but so far I couldn't come up with a nice figure that would achieve this. Added: Matthew Stewart (1717–1785) published this theorem as Proposition II on page 2 in his 1746 book Some general theorems of considerable use in the higher parts of mathematics (arxive.org). Unfortunately, Google's scans don't seem to include the figures, but they are easy to reconstruct from the description in the text. Update: (by @brainjam) I've taken the liberty of adding a partial scan of the figures from another Google scan - One case of Stewart's Proposition II reads in the above notation: $$b^2 + c^2 \\frac{n}{m} = an + d^2 \\frac{a}{m}$$ and it has the following nice corollary: $$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2d^2 + m^2 + n^2.$$ Here's the title page and the relevant passage (not using trigonometry either). Since Proposition I is used in the proof, I'm including the entire beginning of the text:",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove Stewart's theorem without using trigonometry. The original theorem is given by the equation b²m + c²n = a(d² + mn). First, I need to recall what each variable represents in the context of a triangle. \n\nStewart's theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the length of a cevian. In a triangle, let's say we have side lengths opposite to vertices as usual, but here the notation might be a bit different. Typically, in Stewart's theorem, we have a triangle ABC with a cevian AD, where D is a point on BC. The lengths are then: BD = m, DC = n, so BC = a = m + n. The cevian AD has length d. The sides AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. \n\nSo the theorem states that b²m + c²n = a(d² + mn). The user is asking for a proof that doesn't involve trigonometry, specifically avoiding the Law of Cosines, which is commonly used in proofs they've found. \n\nMy first thought is to consider using similar triangles or the Pythagorean theorem, but since it's a general theorem for any triangle, maybe coordinate geometry could work. Alternatively, using areas or vectors. Let me explore these possibilities.\n\nAnother approach is to use the Pythagorean theorem by constructing altitudes or other auxiliary lines. Alternatively, using the theorem of Apollonius, which is a special case of Stewart's theorem for a median. But since Stewart's theorem applies to any cevian, not just medians, Apollonius' theorem might not be directly applicable, but maybe the method can be adapted.\n\nWait, let's think about coordinate geometry. If we place the triangle in a coordinate system, perhaps with point B at (0,0), C at (a,0), and A somewhere in the plane. Then point D is at (m,0) since BD = m and DC = n, with a = m + n. Then coordinates of A can be (x,y), and we can compute the distances squared. Let's see:\n\nLet’s assign coordinates. Let’s place point B at (0,0), point C at (a,0), so BC is along the x-axis. Point D is on BC, so its coordinates are (m,0) since BD = m. Point A is somewhere in the plane, say (p,q). Then AB = c, so distance from A to B: sqrt((p-0)^2 + (q-0)^2) = c, so p² + q² = c². Similarly, AC = b, so distance from A to C: sqrt((p - a)^2 + q²) = b, so (p - a)^2 + q² = b². The length AD is d, so distance from A to D: sqrt((p - m)^2 + q²) = d, so (p - m)^2 + q² = d².\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\n1. p² + q² = c² (from AB = c)\n2. (p - a)^2 + q² = b² (from AC = b)\n3. (p - m)^2 + q² = d² (from AD = d)\n\nIf we subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (p - a)^2 - p² = b² - c². Expanding: p² - 2ap + a² - p² = -2ap + a² = b² - c². So -2ap + a² = b² - c² → -2ap = b² - c² - a² → p = (a² + c² - b²)/(2a). That's from the Law of Cosines, but maybe we can avoid invoking it here.\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 1 from equation 3: (p - m)^2 - p² = d² - c² → -2mp + m² = d² - c² → -2mp = d² - c² - m² → p = (c² + m² - d²)/(2m). Wait, but from earlier, p was expressed in terms of a, b, c. So equate the two expressions for p:\n\n(a² + c² - b²)/(2a) = (c² + m² - d²)/(2m)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2a m:\n\nm(a² + c² - b²) = a(c² + m² - d²)\n\nExpand left side: m a² + m c² - m b² = a c² + a m² - a d²\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nm a² + m c² - m b² - a c² - a m² + a d² = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\na² m - a m² + m c² - a c² - m b² + a d² = 0\n\nFactor terms with a and m:\n\na m (a - m) + c² (m - a) - m b² + a d² = 0\n\nNote that (m - a) = -n, since a = m + n. So:\n\na m (-n) + c² (-n) - m b² + a d² = 0\n\nSo:\n\n- a m n - c² n - m b² + a d² = 0\n\nMultiply through by -1:\n\na m n + c² n + m b² - a d² = 0\n\nRearrange terms:\n\nb² m + c² n = a d² - a m n\n\nWait, but according to Stewart's theorem, it should be b² m + c² n = a (d² + m n). So, here we have:\n\nb² m + c² n = a d² - a m n\n\nBut according to the theorem, it's a(d² + mn). So there's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe there's an error in the sign. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, when I replaced (m - a) with -n, that's correct because a = m + n, so a - m = n, so m - a = -n. Then:\n\nThe line after substitution:\n\na m (-n) + c² (-n) - m b² + a d² = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n- a m n - c² n - m b² + a d² = 0\n\nThen moving terms:\n\na d² = a m n + c² n + m b²\n\nDivide both sides by a:\n\nd² = m n + (c² n + b² m)/a\n\nBut according to Stewart's theorem, the right-hand side should be (d² + mn) multiplied by a. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from earlier:\n\nAfter substituting (m - a) = -n, we have:\n\na m (-n) + c² (-n) - m b² + a d² = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- a m n - c² n - m b² + a d² = 0\n\nThen, moving the terms except a d² to the other side:\n\na d² = a m n + c² n + m b²\n\nThen, divide both sides by a:\n\nd² = m n + (c² n + b² m)/a\n\nBut Stewart's theorem is:\n\nb² m + c² n = a (d² + m n)\n\nWhich rearranged gives:\n\nb² m + c² n = a d² + a m n\n\nThen, moving a d² to the left:\n\nb² m + c² n - a d² = a m n\n\nBut from our previous result, we have:\n\na d² = a m n + c² n + m b² → a d² - a m n = c² n + m b² → a (d² - m n) = c² n + m b²\n\nBut according to Stewart's theorem, it's a(d² + mn) = b² m + c² n. There's a sign discrepancy here. This suggests that somewhere in the derivation, there's a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps when I set up the coordinate system. Let me check the equations again.\n\nCoordinates: B at (0,0), C at (a,0), D at (m,0), and A at (p,q). Then AB = c: sqrt(p² + q²) = c → p² + q² = c².\n\nAC = b: sqrt((p - a)^2 + q²) = b → (p - a)^2 + q² = b².\n\nAD = d: sqrt((p - m)^2 + q²) = d → (p - m)^2 + q² = d².\n\nSubtracting equation for AB from AC:\n\n(p - a)^2 + q² - (p² + q²) = b² - c² → p² - 2 a p + a² - p² = b² - c² → -2 a p + a² = b² - c² → p = (a² + c² - b²)/(2 a). That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting equation for AB from AD:\n\n(p - m)^2 + q² - (p² + q²) = d² - c² → p² - 2 m p + m² - p² = d² - c² → -2 m p + m² = d² - c² → p = (m² + c² - d²)/(2 m). Correct.\n\nEquate the two expressions for p:\n\n(a² + c² - b²)/(2 a) = (m² + c² - d²)/(2 m)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 a m:\n\nm(a² + c² - b²) = a(m² + c² - d²)\n\nExpand left: a² m + c² m - b² m = a m² + a c² - a d²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na² m + c² m - b² m - a m² - a c² + a d² = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nm(a² - m a) + c²(m - a) - b² m + a d² = 0\n\nNote that a = m + n, so a - m = n. Therefore:\n\nm(a(a - m)) + c²(m - a) - b² m + a d² = m(a n) + c²(-n) - b² m + a d² = a m n - c² n - b² m + a d² = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\na d² = a m n + c² n + b² m\n\nDivide both sides by a:\n\nd² = m n + (b² m + c² n)/a\n\nBut Stewart's theorem states that b² m + c² n = a(d² + m n). Let's rearrange that:\n\nb² m + c² n = a d² + a m n → a d² = b² m + c² n - a m n → d² = (b² m + c² n)/a - m n\n\nBut from our coordinate geometry approach, we have d² = m n + (b² m + c² n)/a. Wait, that would mean:\n\nd² = (b² m + c² n)/a + m n\n\nWhich matches Stewart's theorem: b² m + c² n = a(d² + m n) → dividing both sides by a: (b² m + c² n)/a = d² + m n → d² = (b² m + c² n)/a - m n. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Wait, my coordinate derivation gives d² = m n + (b² m + c² n)/a, but Stewart's theorem rearranged would give d² = (b² m + c² n)/a - m n. So there's a discrepancy in the sign of m n. This suggests a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let's check the previous steps again. After equating the two expressions for p:\n\nm(a² + c² - b²) = a(m² + c² - d²)\n\nExpanding gives:\n\na² m + c² m - b² m = a m² + a c² - a d²\n\nBringing all terms to the left:\n\na² m + c² m - b² m - a m² - a c² + a d² = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nm(a² - a m) + c²(m - a) - b² m + a d² = 0\n\nSince a = m + n, then a - m = n, so:\n\nm(a n) + c²(-n) - b² m + a d² = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\na m n - c² n - b² m + a d² = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\na d² = a m n + c² n + b² m\n\nDivide by a:\n\nd² = m n + (c² n + b² m)/a\n\nBut according to Stewart's theorem, rearranged, d² = (b² m + c² n)/a - m n. Clearly, there's a sign error here, indicating a mistake in the derivation.\n\nWait, maybe the coordinate assignment is different. Perhaps I assigned BD = m and DC = n, but in Stewart's theorem, the formula is b² m + c² n = a(d² + mn), where a = m + n. Let me check the standard statement of Stewart's theorem to confirm variable assignments.\n\nIn standard Stewart's theorem, for triangle ABC with cevian AD, where D divides BC into segments BD = m and DC = n, then the formula is:\n\nAB² * n + AC² * m = BC * (AD² + m * n)\n\nBut in the problem statement here, the formula is written as b² m + c² n = a (d² + mn). So comparing to the standard formula, the sides AB and AC here are labeled as c and b respectively, and BC is a. So BD = m, DC = n, and AD = d. So the standard formula would be c² n + b² m = a (d² + m n), which matches the problem statement. \n\nBut in my coordinate setup, AB is c (distance from A to B), AC is b (distance from A to C), BD is m, DC is n, and AD is d. So the variables are consistent. Then why is there a discrepancy in signs?\n\nWait, in the coordinate derivation, we arrived at:\n\na d² = a m n + b² m + c² n\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nb² m + c² n = a d² - a m n\n\nBut according to Stewart's theorem, it should be b² m + c² n = a d² + a m n. So there's a minus instead of a plus. This suggests an error in the coordinate setup or the algebra steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of subtraction. Let me check the equations again.\n\nFrom the coordinate system:\n\n1. AB = c → p² + q² = c²\n\n2. AC = b → (p - a)^2 + q² = b²\n\nSubtracting 1 from 2:\n\n(p - a)^2 - p² = b² - c² → -2 a p + a² = b² - c² → p = (a² + c² - b²)/(2a). This is correct.\n\nSimilarly, AD = d → (p - m)^2 + q² = d². Subtract 1 from this:\n\n(p - m)^2 - p² = d² - c² → -2 m p + m² = d² - c² → p = (m² + c² - d²)/(2 m)\n\nEquate the two expressions for p:\n\n(a² + c² - b²)/(2a) = (m² + c² - d²)/(2 m)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 a m:\n\nm(a² + c² - b²) = a(m² + c² - d²)\n\nExpand:\n\na² m + c² m - b² m = a m² + a c² - a d²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na² m + c² m - b² m - a m² - a c² + a d² = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nm(a² - a m) + c²(m - a) - b² m + a d² = 0\n\nNow, since a = m + n, then a - m = n, so m(a² - a m) = m a (a - m) = m a n\n\nSimilarly, c²(m - a) = c² (-n)\n\nSo substituting:\n\nm a n - c² n - b² m + a d² = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\na d² = m a n + c² n + b² m\n\nDivide by a:\n\nd² = m n + (c² n + b² m)/a\n\nBut according to Stewart's theorem, we have:\n\nb² m + c² n = a (d² + m n) → d² = (b² m + c² n)/a - m n\n\nBut according to the derivation, d² = m n + (b² m + c² n)/a. This is a contradiction unless m n is negative, which it can't be since lengths are positive. So there's a clear mistake here. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait a second, maybe the problem is in the direction of the coordinates. Let me reassign the coordinates differently. Let’s consider point D between B and C, with BD = m and DC = n, so BC = a = m + n. Let me place point B at (0,0), point D at (m,0), and point C at (m + n, 0). So BC is from (0,0) to (m + n,0), D is at (m,0). Then point A is somewhere in the plane, say (x,y). Then AB = c: sqrt(x² + y²) = c → x² + y² = c².\n\nAC = b: sqrt((x - (m + n))² + y²) = b → (x - (m + n))² + y² = b².\n\nAD = d: sqrt((x - m)^2 + y²) = d → (x - m)^2 + y² = d².\n\nNow subtract AB from AC equation:\n\n(x - (m + n))² + y² - (x² + y²) = b² - c² → x² - 2(m + n)x + (m + n)^2 - x² = b² - c² → -2(m + n)x + (m + n)^2 = b² - c² → x = [ (m + n)^2 + c² - b² ] / [2(m + n)].\n\nSimilarly, subtract AB from AD equation:\n\n(x - m)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = d² - c² → x² - 2m x + m² - x² = d² - c² → -2m x + m² = d² - c² → x = [ m² + c² - d² ] / (2m).\n\nEquate the two expressions for x:\n\n[ (m + n)^2 + c² - b² ] / [2(m + n)] = [ m² + c² - d² ] / (2m )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(m + n)m:\n\nm[(m + n)^2 + c² - b²] = (m + n)[m² + c² - d²]\n\nExpand left side:\n\nm(m² + 2 m n + n²) + m(c² - b²) = m^3 + 2 m² n + m n² + m c² - m b²\n\nRight side:\n\n(m + n)(m²) + (m + n)(c² - d²) = m^3 + n m² + (m + n)(c² - d²)\n\nSo left side: m^3 + 2 m² n + m n² + m c² - m b²\n\nRight side: m^3 + n m² + m(c² - d²) + n(c² - d²)\n\nSet left = right:\n\nm^3 + 2 m² n + m n² + m c² - m b² = m^3 + n m² + m(c² - d²) + n(c² - d²)\n\nSubtract m^3 from both sides:\n\n2 m² n + m n² + m c² - m b² = n m² + m(c² - d²) + n(c² - d²)\n\nSimplify left side: 2 m² n + m n² + m c² - m b²\n\nRight side: m² n + m c² - m d² + n c² - n d²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2 m² n + m n² + m c² - m b² - m² n - m c² + m d² - n c² + n d² = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2 m² n - m² n) + m n² + (m c² - m c²) - m b² + m d² - n c² + n d² = 0 → m² n + m n² - m b² + m d² - n c² + n d² = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nm n (m + n) - m b² + m d² - n c² + n d² = 0\n\nNote that a = m + n, so m n (m + n) = a m n\n\nThus:\n\na m n - m b² + m d² - n c² + n d² = 0\n\nFactor m and n:\n\nm (a n - b² + d²) + n (-c² + d²) = 0\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Let's rearrange terms:\n\na m n + m d² + n d² = m b² + n c²\n\nFactor d²:\n\nd² (m + n) + a m n = m b² + n c²\n\nBut since a = m + n, then:\n\nd² a + a m n = m b² + n c² → a (d² + m n) = m b² + n c²\n\nWhich is exactly Stewart's theorem: b² m + c² n = a (d² + m n)\n\nAh, finally! So the earlier mistake was due to an incorrect coordinate setup where I placed point C at (a,0) but then considered a = m + n, which was correct, but in the first attempt, there was an error in the algebra when moving terms. By redoing the derivation with careful attention, we arrive at the correct result.\n\nTherefore, the coordinate geometry approach works, and this derivation doesn't use trigonometry, just algebraic manipulation of distances in coordinate system. Thus, this serves as a valid proof without using the Law of Cosines or trigonometric identities.",
