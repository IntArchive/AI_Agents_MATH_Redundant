    "Content": "This is exercise 12.4 in Characteristic Classes by Milnor and Stasheff. The essential content of the exercise is to show that $w_2(TM)=0$, where $M$ is a closed, oriented 3-manifold, $TM$ its tangent bundle, and $w_2$ the second Stiefel-Whitney class.  The hint is to use Wu's formula (11.14), which in this instance says that \n$$ w_2(TM)=v^2,$$ where $v\\in H^1(M,\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is such that, for any $x\\in H^2(M,\\mathbb{Z}_2)$, $vx=Sq^1(x)$.  Now I can show from this that $v^3=0$, but why does $v^2=0$? I don't think I know enough about Steenrod squares to finish! I should mention that I know there are other ways of showing $w_2(TM)=0$ (spin structures, etc.), but I am trying to follow the hint!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\newcommand{\\Sq}{\\operatorname{Sq}}$ For this exercise, it is useful to recall the following property of the Steenrod squares\n$$\\Sq^k: H^n(M; \\Bbb Z/2) \\longrightarrow H^{n+k}(M; \\Bbb Z/2):$$ $(\\ast)$ If $a \\in H^n(M)$, then $\\Sq^0(a) = a$, $\\Sq^n(a) = a \\smile a$, and $\\Sq^k(a) = 0$ for all $k > n$. The axiomatic description of the Steenrod squares, which includes the above property as an axiom, is given by Milnor and Stasheff in Chapter 8, where they use the Steenrod squares to construct Stiefel-Whitney classes. We can use $(\\ast)$ to compute all the Stiefel-Whitney classes of a compact, oriented $3$-manifold $M$. In what follows, we write $v_k$ for the degree $k$ part of the total Wu class\n$$v = 1 + v_1 + v_2 + v_3.$$ Since $M$ is oriented, we know that $w_1 = 0$. By Wu's formula,\n$$w_1 = \\Sq^1(1) + \\Sq^0(v_1) = v_1,$$\nwhere we used $(\\ast)$ twice. Hence $v_1 = 0$ in this case. Now let us show that $w_3$ is zero. First, by the definition of the Wu class,\n$$v_2 \\smile x = \\Sq^2(x)$$\nfor all $x \\in H^1(M; \\Bbb Z/2)$. But since $1 < 2$, we have that\n$$v_2 \\smile x = 0$$\nfor all $x \\in H^1(M; \\Bbb Z/2)$, and hence\n$$v_2 = 0.$$\nSimilarly,\n$$v_3 = 0.$$\nNow by Wu's formula,\n$$w_3  = \\Sq^3(1) + \\Sq^2(v_1) + \\Sq^1(v_2) + \\Sq^0(v_3) = 0$$\nby using $(\\ast)$ on the first two terms and the fact that $v_2 = v_3 = 0$ on the last two terms. Finally, by Wu's formula,\n$$w_2 = \\Sq^2(1) + \\Sq^1(v_1) + \\Sq^0(v_2) = 0$$\nby using $(\\ast)$ on the first term and the fact that $v_1 = v_2 = 0$ on the last two terms. We conclude that $w_1 = w_2 = w_3 = 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor, specifically formatting a Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem statement then follows.\n\nLooking at the original question: It's about proving that the second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2 of the tangent bundle TM of a closed, oriented 3-manifold M is zero. The user mentions using Wu's formula, which relates w_2(TM) to v², where v is an element in H¹(M, ℤ₂) satisfying certain properties with Steenrod squares. The user is stuck on why v² must be zero, despite knowing that v³ is zero.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that M is a closed, oriented 3-manifold, TM is its tangent bundle, and w_2 is the second Stiefel-Whitney class. The hint uses Wu's formula, which here says w_2(TM) = v². The conditions on v are that for any x in H²(M, ℤ₂), v ∪ x = Sq¹(x). The user also mentions showing v³ = 0 but not v² = 0.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include properties of M (closed, oriented, 3-dimensional), the tangent bundle TM, the Stiefel-Whitney class w_2, the application of Wu's formula leading to w_2 = v², the definition of v via the Steenrod square Sq¹, and perhaps that v³ = 0. However, the problem is to show w_2(TM) = 0, which via Wu's formula reduces to showing v² = 0. The user already knows v³ = 0 but needs to connect that to v² = 0.\n\nIn the example given, the assumption lines each address one property of a single object. Here, the key objects are M, TM, w_2, v, and the cohomology classes. So each assumption should be a single line about one of these. For example:\n\n- M is a closed, oriented 3-manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- w_2(TM) is the second Stiefel-Whitney class of TM.\n- Wu's formula gives w_2(TM) = v² where v ∈ H¹(M, ℤ₂).\n- For any x ∈ H²(M, ℤ₂), v ∪ x = Sq¹(x).\n- v³ = 0 in H³(M, ℤ₂).\n\nBut wait, the user mentions they have shown v³ = 0. Is that part of the problem's given information or their own progress? The original problem states that the essential content is to show w_2(TM)=0 using Wu's formula, and the user is stuck on why v²=0 despite knowing v³=0. So perhaps the fact that v³=0 is a result they derived, but not an assumption given in the problem. Therefore, the assumptions should only include the problem's given conditions, not the user's derived results.\n\nSo the problem's assumptions as per the exercise would be:\n\n- M is a closed, oriented 3-manifold.\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n- Wu's formula applies, giving w_2(TM) = v² where v ∈ H¹(M, ℤ₂).\n- For all x ∈ H²(M, ℤ₂), v ∪ x = Sq¹(x).\n\nThe problem is to prove that w_2(TM) = 0, which via Wu's formula is equivalent to proving v² = 0.\n\nTherefore, formatting this:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a closed, oriented 3-manifold,\nTM is the tangent bundle of M,\n$w_2(TM)$ is the second Stiefel-Whitney class of TM,\nWu's formula gives $w_2(TM) = v^2$ where $v \\in H^1(M, \\mathbb{Z}_2)$,\nFor any $x \\in H^2(M, \\mathbb{Z}_2)$, $v \\cup x = Sq^1(x)$.\nProblem:\nProve that $w_2(TM) = 0$.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the original question is to show that w_2(TM) = 0. The user mentions that using Wu's formula gives w_2(TM) = v², and they need to show v² = 0. So the problem statement should be to prove that w_2(TM) = 0, with the given assumptions. The Wu's formula and the property of v are part of the problem's setup.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions (M closed, oriented 3-manifold; TM its tangent bundle; Wu's formula applies; v satisfies v ∪ x = Sq¹(x) for x in H²; and the problem is to prove w_2(TM) = 0).\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though in the original problem it's not stated. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the example given by the user shows:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions include \"n is divisible by 7\".\n\nBut that seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made an error in their example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example, but the user is providing that as their own example. So I should follow the user's example structure even if there's a mistake?\n\nWait, no. The user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example might be a bad one, but perhaps the user wants to split the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. In the original example, the problem is to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is divisible by 7, which isn't in the original. That suggests that maybe the user intended to extract hidden assumptions or necessary conditions. But perhaps the example is not correctly formatted. However, since the user provided that example, I should follow their format, even if it's flawed.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. So perhaps the example is wrong, but the user wants me to follow their structure, which includes listing all assumptions, even if they are not explicitly stated but derived from context? That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to split the problem into given conditions (assumptions) and what needs to be proven. For the original example, maybe the actual problem is that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the user misstated the original problem. Alternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow their approach.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed. The task is to list all assumptions of the problem line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem.\n\nFor the current problem:\n\nOriginal Title: Second Stiefel-Whitney Class of a 3 Manifold\n\nQuestion content: Exercise 12.4 in Milnor and Stasheff. Show that w_2(TM)=0 for M a closed, oriented 3-manifold. Hint uses Wu's formula: w_2(TM)=v² where v ∈ H¹(M,ℤ₂) satisfies v ∪ x = Sq¹(x) for any x ∈ H²(M,ℤ₂). User can show v³=0 but can't see why v²=0.\n\nSo the assumptions from the problem statement:\n\n- M is a closed, oriented 3-manifold.\n\n- TM is the tangent bundle of M.\n\n- w_2(TM) is the second Stiefel-Whitney class of TM.\n\n- Wu's formula gives w_2(TM) = v² where v ∈ H¹(M, ℤ₂).\n\n- For any x ∈ H²(M, ℤ₂), v ∪ x = Sq¹(x).\n\nProblem: Prove that w_2(TM) = 0.\n\nThe user's own progress (showing v³=0) is not part of the problem's assumptions, so it shouldn't be listed. The key is to extract the given conditions from the problem, not the user's attempts.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those assumptions and the problem statement to prove w_2(TM)=0.",
