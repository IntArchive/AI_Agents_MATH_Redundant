    "Content": "Say $\\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal, and let $X=[0,\\omega_1]$ (with the order topology). Elsewhere it is said that Rao & Rao proved a result that is easily seen to be equivalent to this: Lemma (Rao & Rao). If $\\nu$ is a Borel probability measure on $X$ and $\\nu(\\{j\\})=0$ for every $j\\in X$ then $\\nu$ is the Dieudonne measure. Which is the same as saying that $\\nu(K)=1$ for every uncountable compact $K$ . I find this hard to believe. Stuck at home right now with no access to the paper; anyone have a hint? A brief reminder re the Dieudonne measure: Say $M_1$ is the class of all $E\\subset X$ such that $E\\cup\\{\\omega_1\\}$ contains an uncountable compact set; let $M_0=\\{X\\setminus E:E\\in M_1\\}$ and $M=M_1\\cup M_0$ . Then $M$ is a $\\sigma$ -algebra containing every Borel set (hint: it's clear that $M$ contains every compact set); noting that $M_1\\cap M_0=\\emptyset$ we define the Dieudonne measure $\\lambda$ on $M$ by $$\\lambda(E)=\\begin{cases}1,&(E\\in M_1),\\\\0,&(E\\in M_0).\\end{cases}$$ See for example  Exercise 18 in Chapter 2 of Rudin Real and Complex Analysis ...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The key ingredient is the following theorem of Ulam: Theorem : Let $\\mu$ be a finite measure defined on the entire power set $P(\\omega_1)$ which vanishes on singletons.  Then $\\mu=0$ . In particular, we can apply this to your setup as follows. Corollary : Let $\\nu$ be a Borel probability measure on $\\omega_1$ which vanishes on singletons, and suppose $U\\subset\\omega_1$ can be written as a disjoint union of bounded open sets.  Then $\\nu(U)=0$ . Proof of Corollary from Theorem : Suppose $U=\\bigcup_{\\alpha<\\omega_1} U_\\alpha$ where the $U_\\alpha$ are disjoint, bounded, and open.  Define a measure $\\mu$ on $P(\\omega_1)$ by $\\mu(A)=\\nu(\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in A} U_\\alpha)$ (this is well-defined since such a union is always open and a measure since the $U_\\alpha$ are disjoint).  Then $\\mu$ vanishes on singletons since each $U_\\alpha$ is bounded.  Thus by the Theorem, $\\mu=0$ , and in particular $\\nu(U)=\\mu(\\omega_1)=0$ . Now to prove your Lemma, let $K\\subset\\omega_1$ be any closed unbounded set and let $U=\\omega_1\\setminus K$ .  Enumerating the elements of $K$ in order as $(c_\\alpha)_{\\alpha<\\omega_1}$ , then we can partition $U$ into the bounded open sets $[0,c_0)$ and $(c_\\alpha,c_{\\alpha+1})$ as $\\alpha$ ranges over all of $\\omega_1$ .  Thus by the Corollary, $\\nu(U)=0$ and so $\\nu(K)=1$ . Finally, here is a proof of the Theorem.  Suppose $\\mu$ is nonzero.  For each $\\alpha<\\omega_1$ , let $f_\\alpha:\\alpha\\to\\omega$ be an injection.  For $\\beta<\\omega_1$ and $n<\\omega$ , let $A_{\\beta,n}=\\{\\alpha:f_\\alpha(\\beta)=n\\}$ .  Note that for fixed $\\beta$ , $\\bigcup_n A_{\\beta,n}=\\omega_1\\setminus(\\beta+1)$ (since $f_\\alpha(\\beta)$ is defined as long as $\\alpha>\\beta$ ), which has full measure since $\\mu$ vanishes on countable sets.  Thus for each $\\beta$ there is some $n$ such that $A_{\\beta,n}$ has positive measure.  Since there are uncountably many $\\beta$ 's and only countably many $n$ 's, then must be some fixed $n$ such that $A_{\\beta,n}$ has positive measure for uncountably many different $\\beta$ .  But for fixed $n$ , the sets $A_{\\beta,n}$ are disjoint since the functions $f_\\alpha$ are injective.  Since a finite measure cannot have an uncountable family of disjoint sets of positive measure, this is a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Borel measures on ω₁.\" The user is referring to a lemma attributed to Rao & Rao, which states that if ν is a Borel probability measure on X = [0, ω₁] (where ω₁ is the first uncountable ordinal) such that ν({j}) = 0 for every j in X, then ν is the Dieudonné measure. The user is skeptical and stuck, asking for a hint.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions several things:\n\n1. X is [0, ω₁] with the order topology. So the space in question is the space of all ordinals up to and including the first uncountable ordinal, equipped with the order topology.\n\n2. ν is a Borel probability measure on X. That means ν is defined on the Borel σ-algebra of X, ν(X) = 1, and it's countably additive.\n\n3. For every j in X, ν({j}) = 0. So the measure assigns zero mass to every singleton set.\n\nThe conclusion to be proved is that ν must be the Dieudonné measure. The Dieudonné measure is defined such that it assigns 1 to sets in M₁ (those whose union with {ω₁} contains an uncountable compact set) and 0 to their complements in M₀.\n\nThe user also provides some context about the σ-algebra M and how the Dieudonné measure is constructed. However, the key points for the problem are the assumptions on ν and the conclusion that it must coincide with Dieudonné's measure under those conditions.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each condition applied to the relevant objects. Let's break it down:\n\n- X is the space [0, ω₁] with the order topology. So the first assumption is about the space X.\n\n- ν is a Borel probability measure on X. That's a separate assumption about ν.\n\n- For each j in X, ν({j}) = 0. This is another assumption about ν, specifically its value on singletons.\n\nThe problem is to prove that under these conditions, ν is the Dieudonné measure, which is equivalent to stating that ν(K) = 1 for every uncountable compact K. Wait, the user mentions that the lemma says ν is Dieudonné measure, which is the same as ν(K)=1 for every uncountable compact K. So perhaps the problem is to show that ν(K)=1 for all uncountable compact K, given that ν is a Borel probability measure with no atoms (since all singletons have measure zero).\n\nBut I need to make sure the problem statement is accurate based on the original question. The user says the lemma states that if ν is a Borel probability measure with ν({j})=0 for all j, then ν is Dieudonné measure. So the problem is to prove that ν must be the Dieudonné measure under those assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. X = [0, ω₁] with the order topology.\n\n2. ν is a Borel probability measure on X.\n\n3. For every j ∈ X, ν({j}) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that ν is the Dieudonné measure.\n\nBut I need to check if there are more assumptions. For instance, does the Dieudonné measure have any specific properties that need to be matched? The user also mentions that the Dieudonné measure assigns 1 to every uncountable compact set. However, in the problem statement, the conclusion is that ν is equal to the Dieudonné measure, which is defined via the σ-algebra M. But the problem as presented by the user is that given ν is a Borel probability measure with no point masses, then ν must be Dieudonné. So the problem is to show that under these conditions, ν coincides with Dieudonné measure, i.e., for any Borel set E, ν(E) is 1 if E ∈ M₁ and 0 if E ∈ M₀. Alternatively, since the Dieudonné measure is defined on M, but ν is a Borel measure. However, the user mentions that M contains every Borel set, so perhaps the problem is to show that ν(E) = λ(E) for all Borel sets E, where λ is Dieudonné measure.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the Dieudonné measure is characterized by assigning measure 1 to every uncountable compact set. So the problem could be phrased as proving that ν(K) = 1 for every uncountable compact K, given that ν is a Borel probability measure with no atoms.\n\nBut according to the user's initial statement, the lemma is that ν must be Dieudonné measure. So the problem is to show that under the given assumptions, ν coincides with the Dieudonné measure, which is equivalent to ν(K) = 1 for all uncountable compact K.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is the space [0, ω₁] with the order topology.\n\n- ν is a Borel probability measure on X.\n\n- For every j in X, ν({j}) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that ν is the Dieudonné measure (i.e., ν(K) = 1 for every uncountable compact subset K of X).\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement could directly state to prove that ν is the Dieudonné measure as defined via M₁ and M₀. But since the user mentions that the lemma is equivalent to saying ν(K)=1 for every uncountable compact K, perhaps the problem is to prove that.\n\nBut given the user's exact wording: \"Lemma (Rao & Rao). If ν is a Borel probability measure on X and ν({j})=0 for every j ∈ X then ν is the Dieudonne measure.\" So the problem as stated is to prove that under those assumptions, ν is the Dieudonné measure.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the three assumptions and the problem statement as proving ν is Dieudonné measure.",
