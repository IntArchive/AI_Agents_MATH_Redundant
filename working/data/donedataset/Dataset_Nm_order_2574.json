    "AcceptedAnswer": "Lemma 1. Let $G$ be a group, $H$ be a normal subgroup, $\\pi : G\\to G/H$ the canonical morphism, $R$ be a commutative ring with unit, and $\\varphi : R[G] \\to R[G/H]$ the induced morphism of (perhaps non-commutative) rings induced by $\\pi$. The $\\varphi$ is surjective and $$\\operatorname{Ker}(\\varphi)=\\operatorname{Aug}(R[H])R[G] = R[G] \\operatorname{Aug}(R[H]).$$\nHere, $\\operatorname{Aug}(R[K])$ denotes the augmentation ideal of a group ring $R[K]$. Proof of lemma 1. The surjectivity of $\\varphi$ is obvious, due to the definition of $\\varphi$ and the surjectivity of $\\pi$. The second equality is obvious as $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. We show now the first equality. Write $H = \\{h_i\\}$ for distinct $h_i$'s, and let $K = \\{k_j\\}$ (with distinct $k_j$'s) be a set of coset representatives of $G/H$. Set $g_{i,j} := h_i k_j$. Obviously $G = \\{g_{i,j}\\}$. Now take a $\\zeta\\in\\operatorname{Ker}(\\varphi)$ and write, by what we just said, $\\zeta = \\sum r_{i,j} g_{i,j}$ with $r_{i,j} \\in R$. Then $\\sum_j \\left(\\sum_i r_{i,j}\\right)k_j H = \\varphi(\\zeta) = 0$ and comparing coefficients shows that $\\sum_i r_{i,j} = 0$ for all $j$. Therefore $\\zeta = \\sum r_{i,j} g_{i,j} = \\sum_j \\left(\\sum_i r_{i,j}\\right)k_j$ is in $\\operatorname{Aug}(R[H])R[G]$. The reverse inclusion is obvious, as you remark that if $\\sum_i r_i h_i \\in\\operatorname{Aug}(R[H])$ then it is mapped to $0$ by $\\varphi$. $\\square$ Lemma 2. If $\\varphi : R\\to S$ is a surjective morphism of rings and if $A\\subseteq R$ then $\\varphi[(A)] \\subseteq (\\varphi(A))$. Here, $(A)$ denotes the ideal of $R$ generated by $A$. Proof of lemma 2. Obvious. $\\square$ Lemma 3. Let $R$ be a ring, $I,J$ be additive subgroups of $R$, and suppose $I$ to be central, that is, included in $R$'s center. Then $IJ=JI$ and $(IJ)^n = I^n J^n$. Proof of lemma 3. Obvious. $\\square$ Theorem. Let $p$ be a prime number and $G$ be a finite $p$-group. Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unit such that $p \\cdot 1_R = 0_R$. The augmentation ideal of the group ring $R[G]$ is nilpotent. Proof of the theorem. As $G$ is a $p$-group we have $|G| = p^n$ for some $n\\in\\mathbf{N}$. We proceed by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ is obvious. Let's check at case $n=1$. Then $G$ is cyclic of order $p$, let's say generated by some $x$, and thus $R[G]$ is commutative of characteristic $p$, and you can see that $\\operatorname{Aug}(R[G])$ is generated by $x-1$. As $(x-1)^p = x^p - 1^p = x^p - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$, we see that $\\operatorname{Aug}(R[G])$ is nilpotent indeed. Now we proceed to the inductive step. Suppose that for $n\\geq 1$, for all groups $H$ of order $p^n$, the augmentation ideal of $R[H]$ is nilpotent of exponent $\\leq p^n$, and let $G$ be a $p$-group of order $p^{n+1}$. Since $G$ is a non trivial $p$-group, it has a non-trivial center $Z$ (classic result on $p$-groups...). By Cauchy's theorem we can find an $x\\in Z$ of order $p$. Let $H$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by $x$. As $x\\in Z$ the subgroup $H$ is normal. As in lemma 1 let $\\varphi : R[G] \\to R[G/H]$ be the ring morphism induced by the projection map $\\pi : G\\to G/H$. Now as the augmentation ideal of a group ring is generated by the $g-1$'s and as $\\pi$ is surjective, we have $\\varphi\\left(\\operatorname{Aug}\\left(R[G]\\right)\\right) = \\operatorname{Aug}\\left(R[G/H]\\right)$. By the induction hypothesis the ideal $\\operatorname{Aug}\\left(R[G/H]\\right)$ is nilpotent of exponent $\\leq p^n$, so that its $p^n$-th power is zero, so that $\\varphi\\left(\\operatorname{Aug}\\left(R[G]\\right)\\right)^{p^n} = 0$. As $\\varphi$ is a ring morphism, this entails $\\varphi\\left(\\operatorname{Aug}\\left(R[G]\\right)^{p^n}\\right) = 0$, that is, $\\operatorname{Aug}\\left(R[G]\\right)^{p^n}\\subseteq \\operatorname{Ker}(\\varphi)$. But the ideal $\\operatorname{Ker}(\\varphi)$ is $\\operatorname{Aug}(R[H]) R[G]$, and $\\operatorname{Aug}(R[H])$ is central. By the base case and by Lemma 3, we thus have $\\left(\\operatorname{Ker}(\\varphi)\\right)^p = \\left(\\operatorname{Aug}(R[H])\\right)^p \\left( R[G]\\right)^p = 0 \\left(R[G]\\right)^p =0$. We find finally that $\\operatorname{Aug}\\left(R[G]\\right)^{p^{n+1}} = 0$. $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to extract all the assumptions from the original question. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about proving that the augmentation ideal in the group ring ℤ/pℤG is a nilpotent ideal. The given conditions are that p is a prime, G is a finite p-group. The augmentation ideal I_G consists of elements where the sum of coefficients is zero. The user is stuck showing that some power of I_G becomes zero.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. p is a prime. That's a primary condition here.\n2. G is a finite group. The problem states G is a p-group, which means its order is a power of p. So, maybe split this into two assumptions: G is a finite group, and the order of G is a power of p (i.e., a p-group).\n3. The ring in question is (ℤ/pℤ)G. Since p is prime, ℤ/pℤ is a field, but the ring here is the group ring over this field. The ring may be noncommutative because G could be non-abelian.\n4. I_G is the augmentation ideal, defined as the set of formal linear combinations where the sum of coefficients is zero. That's a key part of the problem.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"augmentation ideal in the group ring ℤ/pℤG\". So the augmentation ideal is specific to this group ring. The definition given is that elements are sums of n_i g_i with sum n_i = 0. So that's the augmentation ideal.\n\nThe problem wants to prove that this ideal is nilpotent, meaning some power of it is zero. The user is having trouble finding such an m.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each condition applied to each object. Let me list them:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is a power of p (G is a p-group).\n- The ring is (ℤ/pℤ)G, which may be noncommutative.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of the ring (ℤ/pℤ)G, consisting of elements ∑n_i g_i with ∑n_i = 0.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"the augmentation ideal in the group ring ℤ/pℤG\", so perhaps that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. However, the definition of I_G is given, so maybe that's part of the problem's setup. The problem is to prove that I_G is nilpotent under the assumptions that p is prime and G is a p-group.\n\nBut in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, the user had written \"for every integer n\". However, in the example, the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, even though the original problem didn't mention that. Wait, no, looking back, the original example problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests maybe the example was modified. Wait, perhaps there was a typo in the example. Wait, in the original problem, it says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user is using it as an example of how to structure, not necessarily as correct content. So perhaps the key is to extract all the given conditions, even if some are redundant. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted version, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless there's a mistake. Maybe the original problem had a different condition. Maybe the example was a mistake. But regardless, the key is that the user wants me to extract the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the given conditions are:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a p-group (so |G| is a power of p).\n- The ring is (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of this ring, defined as elements with sum of coefficients zero.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list each of these. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So:\n\n1. p is a prime.\n2. G is a finite group.\n3. The order of G is a power of p (i.e., G is a p-group).\n4. The ring considered is (ℤ/pℤ)G (which is noncommutative if G is non-abelian).\n5. I_G is the augmentation ideal of (ℤ/pℤ)G, consisting of elements ∑n_i g_i where ∑n_i = 0.\n\nWait, but the problem statement mentions that the ring may be noncommutative. However, group rings over non-abelian groups are noncommutative. So maybe that's an observation, not an assumption. The problem says \"Note that this ring may be noncommutative,\" which is a note, not an assumption. So perhaps we don't include that as an assumption. The ring is (ℤ/pℤ)G, and G is a p-group (so could be non-abelian), making the ring possibly noncommutative, but the problem doesn't state that as a condition; it's a consequence. So the assumptions would be p is prime, G is a finite p-group, and the ring is (ℤ/pℤ)G. The augmentation ideal is part of the problem's setup. The problem is to show that I_G is nilpotent. So perhaps the problem statement includes the definition of I_G, which is part of the problem's premise, so it's an assumption.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is a power of p (i.e., G is a p-group).\n- The ring considered is (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of (ℤ/pℤ)G, consisting of elements where the sum of coefficients is zero.\n\nProblem: Prove that I_G is a nilpotent ideal in (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n\nBut the original problem statement includes the note that the ring may be noncommutative. However, since this is just a note and not an assumption imposed by the problem, we don't include it as an assumption. The non-commutativity is a possible property of the ring due to G being non-abelian, but it's not an assumption given by the problem. The problem only states that p is prime and G is a p-group.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Prove that the augmentation ideal in the group ring ℤ/pℤG is a nilpotent ideal (p is a prime, G is a p-group)\". So the key assumptions are p is prime, G is a p-group, and the rest are part of the problem setup. The definition of I_G is part of the problem's context, so maybe it's not an assumption. Hmm, but in the example provided, the user included the definition of A(n) as part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included the definition of A(n) in the problem statement. Similarly, here, the definition of I_G is part of the problem's setup. However, the example also included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are only the given conditions: p is prime, G is a p-group. The rest (the definition of the augmentation ideal) is part of the problem statement. Wait, but the problem defines I_G as the augmentation ideal. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite p-group.\n- The ring is (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of this ring, i.e., elements with sum of coefficients zero.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove that I_G is nilpotent, and the user is given the definition of I_G, perhaps the definition is part of the problem's context. However, to structure it as per the example, the assumptions include all the conditions given. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though it was part of the problem's universal quantifier. So maybe in this problem, the assumptions would include:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite p-group.\n- The ring (ℤ/pℤ)G has an augmentation ideal I_G consisting of elements ∑n_i g_i with ∑n_i = 0.\n\nSo, each of these as separate assumptions. Let me check each line.\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is a power of p (i.e., G is a p-group).\n- The ring considered is (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- Elements of I_G are formal linear combinations ∑n_i g_i such that ∑n_i = 0.\n\nWait, but maybe the last two can be combined. The problem defines I_G as the augmentation ideal, which is defined as those elements with sum of coefficients zero. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite p-group.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of the group ring (ℤ/pℤ)G, consisting of elements ∑n_i g_i with ∑n_i = 0.\n\nBut per the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe split these:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is a power of p (i.e., G is a p-group).\n- The ring (ℤ/pℤ)G is considered.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- Elements of I_G are formal linear combinations ∑n_i g_i such that ∑n_i = 0.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are redundant. For example, the augmentation ideal's definition is part of what I_G is, so maybe it's one assumption. Let me look again at the original problem statement:\n\n\"Prove that the augmentation ideal in the group ring ℤ/pℤG is a nilpotent ideal (p is a prime, G is a p-group). Let I_G be the augmentation ideal of the group ring ℤ/pℤG, i.e. I_G consists of formal linear combinations ∑n_i g_i (n_i ∈ ℤ/pℤ, g_i ∈ G) such that ∑n_i = 0.\"\n\nSo the problem states that p is prime, G is a p-group, and defines I_G. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite p-group.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of (ℤ/pℤ)G, defined as the set of elements ∑n_i g_i with ∑n_i = 0.\n\nThus, each of these is a separate assumption. However, \"G is a finite p-group\" combines two conditions: G is finite and its order is a power of p. According to the instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition. So we need to split them:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is a power of p (i.e., G is a p-group).\n\nTherefore, the full list of assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is a power of p.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of the group ring (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- Elements of I_G are formal linear combinations ∑n_i g_i with ∑n_i = 0.\n\nBut maybe the last two can be combined: \"I_G is the augmentation ideal of (ℤ/pℤ)G, consisting of elements ∑n_i g_i where ∑n_i = 0.\" Since this is a single property of I_G.\n\nAlternatively, per the example, in the example, the assumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nWhich are two separate assumptions even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". The formatted problem added the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which might be incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. But perhaps the example was illustrative, showing that assumptions can be split. So, following that, we should split each condition into separate lines.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is a power of p.\n- The ring considered is (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of this ring.\n- Elements of I_G are formal linear combinations ∑n_i g_i with coefficients in ℤ/pℤ and ∑n_i = 0.\n\nBut wait, the coefficients being in ℤ/pℤ is part of the ring's definition, so perhaps:\n\n- The ring (ℤ/pℤ)G is the group ring over ℤ/pℤ with group G.\n\nBut the problem states that it's the group ring ℤ/pℤG, so maybe that's part of the setup. However, the key is to list all assumptions given in the problem. The problem states \"the group ring ℤ/pℤG\", so the ring is given as such. The assumptions from the problem are:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite p-group.\n- The ring is (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of this ring, defined as elements with sum of coefficients zero.\n\nBut to split them into single-property lines:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is a power of p.\n- The ring considered is (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- The augmentation ideal I_G consists of elements ∑n_i g_i where ∑n_i = 0.\n\nThat's six assumptions. However, perhaps some of these are implicit. For example, \"G is a finite group\" is stated in the problem (\"let G be a finite group of order a power of p\"). So splitting \"G is a finite group\" and \"the order of G is a power of p\" into two separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a prime.\n- G is a finite group.\n- The order of G is a power of p.\n- The ring considered is (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- I_G is the augmentation ideal of (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n- Elements of I_G are formal linear combinations ∑n_i g_i with ∑n_i = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that I_G is a nilpotent ideal in (ℤ/pℤ)G.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original includes the note that the ring may be noncommutative, but that's not an assumption, just a note. So we don't include that.\n\nI think that's it. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition of one object.",
