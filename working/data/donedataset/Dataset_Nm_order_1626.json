    "Content": "Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry , Exercise III.9.1 asks one to prove A flat morphism $f : X \\to Y$ of finite type of Noetherian schemes is open, i.e., for every open subset $U \\subseteq X$, $f(U)$ is open in $Y$. So far as I can tell this is essentially equivalent to the going down theorem, which only needs the hypothesis of flatness.  Are the Noetherian and finite-type conditions actually needed here?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Just to comment, the finite type and Noetherian hypotheses are probably so one can give a quick proof using Chevalley. The idea of this proof goes as follows: (General Topology) One can show that a constructible subset of a scheme is open if and only if it's closed under generization. (General Topology)  One can also show that $f:X\\to Y$ is such that $f(X)$ is closed under generization if and only if $\\text{Spec}(\\mathcal{O}_{X,x})\\to\\text{Spec}(\\mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)})$ is surjective for all $x\\in X$ . (Algebra) Then one proves the following easy fact: Let $(A,\\mathfrak{m})\\to (B,\\mathfrak{n})$ be a local homomorphism, and $M$ a finitely generated $B$ -module. Then, $M$ is faithfully flat over $A$ if and only if it is flat over $A$ and non-zero. (Algebra) One also checks that if $A\\to B$ is faithfully flat, then $\\text{Spec}(B)\\to\\text{Spec}(A)$ is surjective. Finally, to prove that $f$ is open (if it's flat, finite type and $X,Y$ Noetherian) we just put the pieces together. Clearly it suffices to show that $f(X)$ is open (because then apply this case to the map $U\\hookrightarrow X\\xrightarrow{f} Y$ ). By Chevalley's theorem we know that $f(X)$ is constructible. Thus, by 1. it suffices to prove that $f(X)$ is closed under generization. But, by 2. this is equivalent to checking that $\\text{Spec}(\\mathcal{O}_{X,x})\\to\\text{Spec}(\\mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)})$ is surjective for all $x\\in X$ . But, using 3. (with $A=\\mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)}$ , $B=M=\\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ ) we see that $\\mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)}\\to\\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is faithfully flat, and so by 4. the induced map $\\text{Spec}(\\mathcal{O}_{X,x})\\to\\text{Spec}(\\mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)})$ is indeed surjective. This proof can actually be adapted to the general case (of just finite presentation) by using Grothendieck's \"passing to the limit\" technique. Namely, we can reduce to the affine case $X=\\text{Spec}(B)$ and $Y=\\text{Spec}(A)$ . We can then write $B=\\varinjlim B_\\lambda$ and $A=\\varinjlim A_\\lambda$ where $A_\\lambda$ is a finitely generated algebra over $\\mathbb{Z}$ (and so, in particular, Noetherian) and $B_\\lambda$ is a finitely presented $A_\\lambda$ -algebra. We can then use the fact that since we're in the finitely presented case, there exists some $\\lambda$ such that $$\\begin{matrix}\\text{Spec} (B) & \\to & \\text{Spec}(B_\\lambda)\\\\ \\downarrow & & \\downarrow\\\\ \\text{Spec}(A) & \\to & \\text{Spec}(A_\\lambda)\\end{matrix}$$ is fibered. For a reference for this limit technique, I would suggest looking at section 1.10 of Lei Fu's Etale Cohomology .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question. \n\nThe original question is about Exercise III.9.1 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry, which states that a flat morphism f: X → Y of finite type between Noetherian schemes is open. The user is questioning whether the Noetherian and finite-type conditions are actually necessary, suggesting that the going-down theorem, which requires flatness, might suffice.\n\nSo, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem. The problem as posed by the user is whether the Noetherian and finite-type hypotheses are needed for the conclusion that the flat morphism is open. But in the original exercise, those conditions are given. So the problem here is to determine if those conditions (Noetherian, finite-type) are necessary or if flatness alone is enough.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed as individual conditions. In the original exercise, the assumptions are that f is a flat morphism of finite type between Noetherian schemes. The problem is to prove that such f is open. However, the user's question is challenging whether those conditions (Noetherian, finite-type) are actually required. So perhaps the problem here is to analyze the necessity of those conditions.\n\nBut the user wants the problem structured as per the example. Wait, the example took the original problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) and listed the assumptions (n is integer, n is divisible by 7). Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the original problem is Exercise III.9.1: Prove that a flat morphism of finite type between Noetherian schemes is open. The user is questioning if the assumptions (finite type, Noetherian) are needed. But how to structure this as per the format?\n\nWait, the format requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\" sections. The original exercise has assumptions: f is flat, of finite type, X and Y are Noetherian schemes. The problem is to prove f is open. The user's question is whether those assumptions are necessary. So maybe the problem here is to determine if the conclusion holds without the Noetherian and finite-type conditions. But the user is asking if those conditions are actually needed. The way the example was structured, the assumption included the conditions given in the problem, even if they might not be necessary. But in the example, the original problem had n as integer, and the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, but in that example, the user added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7), but in the original problem, n was any integer. Wait, maybe the example is a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumptions: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example is modified? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Hmm, maybe the example is not a perfect model. But perhaps the key is that in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, even if they are redundant.\n\nIn the current problem, the original exercise has assumptions: f is flat, of finite type, X and Y are Noetherian. The problem is to prove f is open. The user is asking if the Noetherian and finite-type conditions are needed. So perhaps the formatted problem should list the assumptions from the original exercise, and the problem is to prove openness. Then the user's actual question is whether those assumptions are necessary. But according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, filtering unrelated information.\n\nWait, the user says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example shows that in the original problem, there might be some conditions, and in the formatted problem, the assumptions are listed. So for the current question, the original exercise states that f is a flat morphism of finite type between Noetherian schemes, and the problem is to prove f is open. The user is asking if the Noetherian and finite-type conditions are actually needed. But how to structure this?\n\nWait, perhaps the formatted problem should include the original problem's assumptions and the problem statement. The user's question is whether the assumptions are necessary, but the format is to structure the problem as per the example. The example seems to take the original problem's conditions as assumptions. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a flat morphism,\nf is of finite type,\nX is a Noetherian scheme,\nY is a Noetherian scheme.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is open.\n\nBut the user's actual question is whether the Noetherian and finite-type conditions are needed. However, according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the given format, which seems to be extracting the problem's assumptions and problem statement, not the user's meta-question. Wait, but the user's question is the one on Math Stack Exchange, which is asking about the necessity of the conditions. So perhaps the problem to structure is the user's question. Let me re-read.\n\nOriginal problem from user:\n\n\"Title: When is a flat morphism open?\n\nQuestion: Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry , Exercise III.9.1 asks one to prove A flat morphism f : X → Y of finite type of Noetherian schemes is open, i.e., for every open subset U ⊆ X, f(U) is open in Y. So far as I can tell this is essentially equivalent to the going down theorem, which only needs the hypothesis of flatness. Are the Noetherian and finite-type conditions actually needed here?\"\n\nSo the user is asking whether the conditions (Noetherian, finite-type) are necessary for the conclusion (f is open). The original exercise states those conditions. So the problem here is to determine if those conditions are necessary. But how to structure this as per the format?\n\nThe example had assumptions and then the problem. In this case, maybe the problem is to determine under what conditions a flat morphism is open, questioning if Noetherian and finite-type are needed. But the format requires listing assumptions and the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's question is whether the original exercise's conclusion holds without the Noetherian and finite-type conditions. So the problem would be \"Is a flat morphism f : X → Y of schemes open without assuming finite type or Noetherian schemes?\" But the user is not stating a problem to prove something, but to ask a question.\n\nBut the example given was a problem to prove something, with assumptions. So maybe we need to structure the user's question as the problem, and list any assumptions. However, the user is not stating a problem to solve, but asking whether certain conditions are necessary. But perhaps the format requires the problem to be the original exercise, and the assumptions to be the conditions given in that exercise. Then the user's actual question is about the necessity of those assumptions, but the formatted problem would just be the original problem.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example shows that the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem lists the assumption (including n divisible by 7) and the problem. Wait, but in that example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless there was a miscommunication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was a different problem. Maybe the original problem had an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it's not. Wait, the example's original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless the original problem had a typo, or the example is incorrect. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem as per the format.\n\nIn the current case, the original exercise's problem is: Prove that a flat morphism f: X → Y of finite type between Noetherian schemes is open. The assumptions here are that f is flat, of finite type, and X and Y are Noetherian. The problem is to prove f is open. The user's question is whether those assumptions (Noetherian, finite-type) are actually needed.\n\nBut the format requires listing the assumptions of the problem and then the problem statement. So in this case, the original exercise's assumptions would be listed, and the problem is to prove openness. However, the user is asking whether those assumptions are necessary, but perhaps the formatted problem is about the original exercise, not the user's meta-question. However, the user's question is the one to be structured. So the user's question is: Are the Noetherian and finite-type conditions actually needed here?\n\nBut how to phrase that as a problem? Maybe the problem is: Determine whether the Noetherian and finite-type conditions are necessary for a flat morphism f: X → Y to be open. But then what are the assumptions? The original problem's assumptions are that f is flat, finite-type, and Noetherian. But the user is questioning if those are needed, so maybe the assumptions are just that f is a flat morphism of schemes. Then the problem is: Is f open?\n\nBut the example structured the problem by taking the original problem's assumptions and the problem. So perhaps the answer should list the assumptions as in the original exercise (flat, finite-type, Noetherian), and the problem is to prove f is open. However, the user's actual question is whether those assumptions are necessary. But according to the instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the example, which seems to take the original problem's statement and extract assumptions and problem.\n\nTherefore, in this case:\n\nAssumptions:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism,\nf is of finite type,\nX is a Noetherian scheme,\nY is a Noetherian scheme.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is open.\n\nBut the user's actual question is whether the Noetherian and finite-type conditions are needed. However, the format seems to require structuring the original problem, not the user's question about the problem. But the user is presenting their own question (the one on Math Stack Exchange) which is about the necessity of the conditions. So perhaps the problem to structure is the user's question, which is: Are the Noetherian and finite-type conditions actually needed for a flat morphism to be open?\n\nIn that case, the assumptions would be:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism of schemes.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if f is open.\n\nBut the user is asking whether, under only flatness (without finite type and Noetherian), is f open? So the problem is to determine if a flat morphism (without assuming finite type or Noetherian) is open. But how to phrase that in the format.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be: \"Is a flat morphism f: X → Y of schemes necessarily open without the assumptions of finite type and Noetherian schemes?\"\n\nBut the example format has \"Problem: Prove that...\". The user's question is a yes/no question. However, the example given is a problem to prove something, not a yes/no question. So perhaps the format is meant for problems that are statements to prove, not questions. Therefore, maybe the user's question is rephrased as a problem: \"Determine whether the Noetherian and finite-type conditions are necessary for a flat morphism to be open.\"\n\nBut the instructions say to structure the problem as per the example. The example's problem is a statement to prove. So perhaps the user's problem should be structured as:\n\nAssumptions:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism,\nX and Y are schemes.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is open.\n\nBut the user's question is whether the original conditions (finite type, Noetherian) are necessary. So in this case, the formatted problem would list only the assumption of flatness (since the user is questioning if that's sufficient) and ask to prove openness. But the original exercise had more assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is referring to the original exercise, maybe we should structure the original exercise's problem, and then the user's question is separate. But the task is to format the user's question, which is the one on Math Stack Exchange.\n\nWait, the user says: \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" The example was taking the original problem and formatting it. Therefore, the task is to take the user's Math Stack Exchange question (the one they provided) and structure it according to the format.\n\nThe user's Math Stack Exchange question is: \"Are the Noetherian and finite-type conditions actually needed here?\" referring to the exercise that a flat morphism of finite type between Noetherian schemes is open. So the problem here is whether those conditions are necessary. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism of schemes.\n\nProblem:\nIs f open?\n\nBut the original problem required finite type and Noetherian. The user's question is: Can we remove those assumptions and still have f open? Therefore, the formatted problem would list only flatness as the assumption and ask if f is open. Alternatively, the problem could be phrased as: \"Is every flat morphism of schemes open?\" which is the user's implicit question.\n\nBut to match the example, which took the original problem's conditions and structured them, even if in the example it added an extra assumption. But in this case, the user's question is about removing assumptions. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to proceed.\n\nOriginal exercise's assumptions: f is flat, of finite type, Noetherian schemes. Problem: prove f is open.\n\nUser's question: Are finite type and Noetherian needed? So the user is asking if under only flatness, is f open? So the formatted problem's assumptions would be f is flat, and the problem is whether f is open. But perhaps the problem is to determine if the original statement holds without those conditions. So:\n\nAssumptions:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism of schemes.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that f is open.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking if the conditions are needed, maybe the problem is: \"Is a flat morphism of schemes necessarily open?\" with the assumption being only flatness.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the example. The example included all assumptions from the original problem, even if some were redundant. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to add an extra assumption. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the example is correct. \n\nIn any case, following the user's example, the formatted problem should list the assumptions given in the original problem. The original problem here (Exercise III.9.1) has assumptions: f is flat, finite type, Noetherian schemes. The problem is to prove f is open. The user's question is whether those assumptions are needed. But to format according to the example, we list the original problem's assumptions and problem, even if the user is questioning them. But that doesn't address the user's actual question. Alternatively, perhaps the user's question is the problem, and the assumptions are what's left when removing the questioned conditions.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. To proceed, perhaps the safest way is to follow the structure of the example. The example took the original problem, listed its assumptions, and stated the problem. Even if the user's question is about the necessity of the assumptions, the formatted problem should present the original problem as per the example. Therefore, in this case:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism,\nf is of finite type,\nX is a Noetherian scheme,\nY is a Noetherian scheme.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is open.\n\nBut the user's actual question is whether the assumptions of finite type and Noetherian are needed. However, the instructions say to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question, which is the user's question. The user's question is about the necessity of the conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem should reflect the user's question, which is asking if the conditions are necessary, i.e., whether a flat morphism (without finite type or Noetherian) is open.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism of schemes.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if f is necessarily open.\n\nAlternatively, if following the example's structure where the problem is to prove something, perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nIs a flat morphism of schemes open?\n\nBut the example's problem was a statement to prove. The user's question is a yes/no question. However, the example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps the user's question needs to be phrased as a statement to prove. But the user is asking whether certain conditions are necessary, which is a yes/no question. Maybe the problem can be phrased as:\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether a flat morphism of schemes is open without assuming finite type or Noetherian conditions.\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the problem should be:\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that a flat morphism of schemes is open.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about the original exercise's conditions. Therefore, perhaps the problem is:\n\nProblem:\nProve that a flat morphism of schemes is open without assuming finite type or Noetherian conditions.\n\nBut that's not accurate, because the user is questioning if it's possible, not asserting it. Given the confusion, I think the correct approach is to list the assumptions from the original exercise and state the problem as per the exercise, but the user's actual question is different. However, according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which seems to be extracting assumptions and problem from the original problem, not the user's meta-question. Therefore, despite the user's question being about the necessity of conditions, the formatted problem should be the original exercise's problem.\n\nBut the user's provided example seems to have possibly modified the original problem. For instance, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, or there was a miscommunication. Given that, perhaps the task is to structure the user's question (the one on Math Stack Exchange) into assumptions and problem, even if the problem is a question.\n\nIn that case, the user's question is: Are the Noetherian and finite-type conditions actually needed here? So the assumptions would be the ones from the original exercise, and the problem is to determine if those conditions are necessary. But the example's problem is a statement to prove. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA flat morphism f: X → Y of finite type of Noetherian schemes is open.\n\nProblem:\nAre the finite-type and Noetherian conditions necessary for f to be open?\n\nBut the example's format uses \"Prove that...\", but here it's a question. Maybe rephrase:\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether the finite-type and Noetherian conditions are necessary to prove that a flat morphism is open.\n\nAlternatively, following the example's structure, perhaps the problem is phrased as a statement:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the finite-type and Noetherian conditions are necessary for a flat morphism to be open.\n\nBut the user is asking if they are needed, not to prove they are needed. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the safest approach is to structure the original exercise's problem as per the example, listing its assumptions and problem, even if the user is questioning those assumptions. Because the example structured the original problem, not the user's question about the problem. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism,\nf is of finite type,\nX is a Noetherian scheme,\nY is a Noetherian scheme.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is open.\n\nHowever, the user's actual question is about whether those assumptions are needed, which isn't captured in this formatting. But since the example structured the original problem, not the follow-up question, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nBut the user's question on Math Stack Exchange is their own question, not the original exercise. So the task is to structure the user's question, which is: Are the Noetherian and finite-type conditions actually needed here? So the user is asking if a flat morphism (without finite type or Noetherian) is open. Therefore, the formatted problem should reflect that.\n\nHence, the assumptions would be:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism of schemes.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is open.\n\nBut this is incorrect because the original exercise required finite type and Noetherian. The user is asking if those are necessary. Therefore, perhaps the problem is: \"Is every flat morphism of schemes open?\" with the assumption being flatness, and the problem being to prove openness.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included all given conditions, even redundant ones. Since the user is challenging the necessity, the formatted problem should only include the minimal assumptions (flatness) and ask to prove openness. But the original exercise had more assumptions. The user is asking if those are needed.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism of schemes.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is open.\n\nBut this is the problem the user is inquiring about. The user's question is whether, under only flatness, f is open, or if the original conditions are necessary. Therefore, the formatted problem is as above, with the assumption of flatness and the problem to prove openness. The user's actual question is whether this is possible, implying that the original exercise required more conditions. But according to the instructions, we are to structure the user's question as per the example. The example took the original problem, listed assumptions, and problem. Here, the user's question is about a different problem (flatness without finite type or Noetherian), so we structure that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a flat morphism of schemes.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is open.\n\nBut the user's question is whether this is true, i.e., whether the original conditions are necessary. So perhaps the problem is to determine the validity of the statement under only flatness.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking if the original conditions are needed, perhaps the problem is to show that without them, the conclusion may not hold. But the user's question is whether they are needed, which is a meta-question.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example structure where the problem is a statement to prove, and the assumptions are the given conditions, the correct formatted problem would be the original exercise's problem, listing all its assumptions and the problem to prove openness. The user's question is about those assumptions, but the formatted problem is the original one.\n\nHowever, the user's provided example seems to have taken the original problem and possibly added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7), which may not have been in the original problem. This suggests that perhaps in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it. Alternatively, the example is erroneous. Given this uncertainty, but aiming to follow the instructions, I'll proceed to structure the user's Math Stack Exchange question as per the example, which likely involves listing the original exercise's assumptions and problem, even if the user is questioning them.",
