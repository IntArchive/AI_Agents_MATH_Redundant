    "Content": "I'm having trouble with whether Rudin actually proves what he's tried to prove. Proposition 1.14; (page 6)\nThe axioms of addition imply the following statements: a) if $x + y = x + z$ then $y = z$ The author's proof is as follows:\n$ y = (0 + y) = (x + -x) + y = -x + (x + \\textbf{y})$\n$$ = -x + (x + \\textbf{z}) = (-x + x) + z = (0 + z) = z $$ I emphased the section which troubles me. \nHow does Rudin prove that $ y = z $ if he substituted $y = z$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "He didn't substitute $z$ for $y$; rather, he substituted $x+z$ for $x+y$. This is legitimate based on the assumption that $x+y = x+z$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is confused about Rudin's proof in Proposition 1.14 where he shows that if x + y = x + z, then y = z. The user is specifically troubled by the step where Rudin seems to substitute y with z in the equation, which they think might be circular reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The user is asking why Rudin's proof isn't circular. In the proof, Rudin starts with y, manipulates the expressions using axioms, and ends up with z. The user points out that in the step where he writes -x + (x + y) = -x + (x + z), he's substituting y with z, which seems to assume what he's trying to prove. Wait, but actually, that substitution is valid because the premise is x + y = x + z. So Rudin is using the given equation to replace (x + y) with (x + z). That's not substituting y with z directly; it's substituting the entire expression (x + y) with (x + z) because they are equal by hypothesis. Therefore, the step is justified by the premise, not by assuming y = z. The user might have misread that part, thinking Rudin replaced y with z, but actually, he's using the given equality to substitute the entire sum.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions here are about the properties Rudin is using. The problem is to understand why the proof isn't circular. But the user's actual problem is to see how Rudin proves y = z given x + y = x + z without assuming y = z in the process. So the key assumptions are the axioms of addition in a field (since Rudin is working in the context of real numbers, I think). Specifically, the existence of additive inverses (-x), associativity of addition, and the properties of the additive identity (0). The problem is to show that given x + y = x + z, then y = z, using those axioms. The user's confusion is about the substitution step, so the assumptions should list the axioms used in the proof.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions line by line: Each line should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. Addition is associative: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).\n2. Existence of additive inverses: For every x, there exists -x such that x + (-x) = 0.\n3. Additive identity: There exists 0 such that x + 0 = x for all x.\n4. The given condition: x + y = x + z.\n\nSo the problem is to prove y = z under these assumptions. The original problem's title mentions Proposition 1.14 from Baby Rudin, so the problem statement is the same as the proposition: If x + y = x + z, then y = z.\n\nThe user's question is about the validity of the proof steps, but the formatted problem should capture the mathematical problem, not the user's confusion. Wait, the user's problem is about understanding the proof, but the task is to structure the problem as per the given example. The example took the original problem and listed assumptions and the problem to solve. Here, the original problem is Rudin's Proposition 1.14, and the user is confused about the proof. But when structuring, we need to present the mathematical problem (the proposition) along with its assumptions. The confusion about the proof steps is part of the user's question, but the structured problem should be the proposition itself. However, the user's problem might be phrased as \"Prove that if x + y = x + z, then y = z using the axioms of addition,\" but in their question, they are specifically confused about the substitution step in Rudin's proof. However, according to the example, the formatted problem should be the mathematical problem, not the user's confusion. So the assumptions are the axioms used, and the problem is to prove the statement. The user's actual confusion is about a step in the proof, but the task is to structure the problem, not the confusion. So perhaps the formatted problem should list the axioms (assumptions) and the problem statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7) and the problem statement. Wait, but in the original example, the user might have included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was wrong. Wait the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, the task is to structure the problem given the original question. So for the current problem, the original proposition is to prove that if x + y = x + z, then y = z, given the addition axioms. So the assumptions should be the relevant addition axioms, and the problem is to prove the statement. The user's confusion is about the substitution step in the proof, but when structuring the problem, we need to focus on the mathematical problem itself, not the user's misunderstanding. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Addition is associative.\n- Every element has an additive inverse.\n- Existence of additive identity.\n- The equation x + y = x + z holds.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove y = z under these assumptions. But each assumption should be one line, applied to one object. Let me list them properly:\n\nAssumption:\nAddition is associative.\nEvery element x has an additive inverse -x such that x + (-x) = 0.\nThere exists an additive identity 0 such that x + 0 = x for all x.\nGiven that x + y = x + z.\n\nProblem: Prove that y = z.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the key is to list the axioms used in the proof as assumptions and the given equation as another assumption, then the problem is to show y = z. The user's confusion about the substitution step is part of their question but not part of structuring the problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should look like that.",
