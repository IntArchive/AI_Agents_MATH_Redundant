    "Content": "By the fundamental theorem of algebra a real nonconstant polynomial $Q$ has factorisation into real prime factors $$Q=g_1^{k_1}g_2^{k_2}\\cdots g_l^{k_l}$$ The prime factors $g_j$ , all distinct, are first degree polynomials or second degree polynomials without real roots. The exponents are positive integers. The polynomial $Q$ is called square-free if all the exponents $k_j$ equal 1. Exercise: Let $\\psi$ be square-free polynomial of degree $d$ and $P$ have degree less than $2d$ and no prime factor in common with $\\psi$ . Show that the integral $\\int\\frac{P}{\\psi^2}$ is rational if and only if $\\psi$ divides $P'\\psi'-P\\psi''.$ My sratch work: I have noticed that $$(\\frac{P}{\\psi'})'=\\frac{P'\\psi'-P\\psi''}{(\\psi')^2}$$ So I decided use this pattern in the given integral bu using integration by parts : $$\\int\\frac{P}{\\psi^2}=\\int(\\frac{P}{\\psi'})(\\frac{1}{\\psi^2}\\psi')=\\frac{P}{\\psi'}(\\frac{-1}{\\psi})+\\int\\frac{1}{\\psi}\\frac{P'\\psi'-P\\psi''}{(\\psi')^2}$$ Meanwhile the first sum in the right is rational we should care about the rightside integral. Lets consider $$\\int\\frac{1}{\\psi}\\frac{P'\\psi'-P\\psi''}{(\\psi')^2}=\\frac{A}{B}$$ Where A and B are polynomials. So we get $$\\frac{1}{\\psi}\\frac{P'\\psi'-P\\psi''}{(\\psi')^2}=\\frac{A'B-B'A}{B^2} $$ but how judge after I couldn't proceed. Maybe, another approach is using Hermite-Ostragradski method of integration. In this case the integral becomes $$\\int \\frac{P}{\\psi^2}=\\frac{P_1}{\\psi}+\\int \\frac{P_2}{\\psi}$$ The integral on the right hand side\nis transcendental  function since the denominator $\\psi$ is square free and the numerator has lower degree than the denominator. In order integral to be rational the rightside integral should be equal $0$ .\nSo we get an equality $$\\int \\frac{P}{\\psi^2}=\\frac{P_1}{\\psi}$$ and diferrentiate both side : $$\\frac{P}{\\psi^2}=\\frac{P_1'\\psi-P_1\\psi'}{\\psi^2}$$ However I am still unable to proceed further.\nCould anybody help me please.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You just need to combine the two approaches in your answer! Let $\\psi Q=P'\\psi'-P\\psi''$ . Your first approach gives $$\\int\\frac P{\\psi^2}=-\\frac P{\\psi\\psi'}+\\int\\frac Q{\\psi'^2}$$ and your second approach gives $$\\int\\frac P{\\psi^2}=\\frac{P_1}\\psi$$ where upon differentiation, $P_1$ satisfies $P_1'\\psi=P_1\\psi'+P$ . Therefore, $$\\frac{P_1}\\psi=-\\frac P{\\psi\\psi'}+\\int\\frac Q{\\psi'^2}\\iff\\int\\frac Q{\\psi'^2}=\\frac{P_1\\psi'+P}{\\psi\\psi'}=\\frac{P_1'}{\\psi'}$$ and differentiating both sides yields $Q=P_1''\\psi'-P_1'\\psi''$ which is a polynomial.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the problem. The original question is about showing that the integral of P over ψ squared is rational if and only if ψ divides a certain expression involving P', ψ', and ψ''.\n\nLet me parse through the problem statement carefully. The exercise states:\n\n- ψ is a square-free polynomial of degree d.\n- P is a polynomial with degree less than 2d.\n- P and ψ have no common prime factors.\n\nThese are the key assumptions. Each of these should be listed line by line in the Assumption section. Let me check if there's any other conditions. The problem mentions that Q (which is ψ here) is square-free, so that's already covered. The degree conditions on P and ψ are separate. Also, the \"no common prime factor\" is another separate condition. So each of these is a single assumption.\n\nThen the problem is to show the integral is rational iff ψ divides P'ψ' - Pψ''. So the Problem section should state that clearly.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Show that the integral ∫P/ψ² is rational if and only if ψ divides P'ψ' - Pψ''.\" So that's the problem statement. The assumptions are the three points I listed. Let me make sure there's no more hidden conditions. The question mentions that ψ is square-free, which is given. Also, P has degree less than 2d and shares no prime factors with ψ. That's it.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nψ is a square-free polynomial,\nψ has degree d,\nP is a polynomial,\ndegree of P is less than 2d,\nP and ψ have no common prime factors.\n\nProblem: Show that ∫(P/ψ²) dx is rational if and only if ψ divides P'ψ' - Pψ''.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again. The user wrote \"Let ψ be square-free polynomial of degree d and P have degree less than 2d and no prime factor in common with ψ.\" So each of these is a separate condition. So yes, each gets its own line. The problem is exactly as stated. I think that's all. The user's example had assumptions split into each property. So in this case, the four points: ψ square-free, ψ degree d, P is polynomial (though that's maybe redundant, but the problem states P is a polynomial), degree of P less than 2d, and P and ψ coprime (no common prime factors). Wait, the problem says \"P have degree less than 2d and no prime factor in common with ψ.\" So the two conditions on P are degree and coprimality. The two conditions on ψ are square-free and degree d. So total four assumptions. But in the original example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two assumptions. So following that, each condition for each object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nψ is a square-free polynomial,\nψ has degree d,\nP is a polynomial with degree less than 2d,\nP and ψ have no common prime factors.\n\nProblem: Show that the integral ∫(P/ψ²) dx is rational if and only if ψ divides P'ψ' - Pψ''.\n\nYes, that should be correct. The user's scratch work is part of the original question but not needed for the formatted problem. So the answer should capture all the assumptions in the problem statement, each as a separate line, and then the problem.",
