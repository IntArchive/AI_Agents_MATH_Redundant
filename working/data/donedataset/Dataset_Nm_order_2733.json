    "Content": "I'm supposed to prove that $\\mathbb{F}^\\infty$ is infinite-dimensional. I was planning on doing a proof by induction to show that $(1,0,...),(0,1,0,...),...$ is a basis. Is this permissible? Also, I think I could do a proof by contradiction and suppose $\\mathbb{F}^\\infty$ to be finite-dimensional, and thus have a finite-length basis, and then show that there exists some $v\\in\\mathbb{F}^\\infty$ such that $v$ is not in the span of the basis. I'm not quite sure how to show that rigorously though.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "An indirect proof can be simpler than the one you sketch. Suppose that $K^\\infty$ (or $K^{\\mathbb N}$ -- that doesn't matter here) has finite dimension $n$. We know already (I hope) that in a finite-dimensional vector space no linearly independent set can have more members than the dimension. But $\\{\\mathbf e_1,\\mathbf e_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf e_n,\\mathbf e_{n+1}\\}$ is clearly a linearly independent set of size $n+1$, so $n$ can't have been the dimension after all.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that 𝔽^∞ is infinite-dimensional. First, I need to recall some linear algebra basics. The vector space 𝔽^∞ consists of all infinite sequences of elements from the field 𝔽. To show it's infinite-dimensional, we need to demonstrate that no finite set of vectors can span the entire space.\n\nThe user mentioned two approaches: induction and contradiction. Let's think about the contradiction approach. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that 𝔽^∞ has a finite basis with, say, n vectors. Then any vector in the space should be expressible as a linear combination of these n basis vectors. But consider the vector that has 1 in the (n+1)-th position and 0 elsewhere. This vector can't be represented by the basis since all basis vectors have only finite entries (assuming standard basis vectors). Wait, but the basis might not be the standard one. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.\n\nAlternatively, think about the standard basis vectors e₁, e₂, ..., where e_i has 1 in the i-th position and 0 elsewhere. If the space were finite-dimensional, say dimension n, then e_{n+1} would not be in the span of e₁ to e_n. Therefore, the basis can't be finite. But does this require that the basis is the standard one? Actually, any basis would have to span all vectors, including each e_i. So even if the basis vectors are different, you'd need infinitely many to cover all e_i's. Hence, the space can't have a finite basis.\n\nAnother angle: in finite-dimensional spaces, every linearly independent set with size equal to the dimension is a basis. But in 𝔽^∞, we can have infinitely many linearly independent vectors (like the e_i's), which implies the space can't be finite-dimensional.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the required format. The original question is about proving 𝔽^∞ is infinite-dimensional. The assumptions here would relate to the definitions involved. Let's list them:\n\n- 𝔽^∞ is the vector space of all infinite sequences over the field 𝔽.\n- The vector space operations are defined component-wise.\n- A basis for a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that spans the space.\n- The dimension of a vector space is the cardinality of its basis.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the space is infinite-dimensional, the key assumptions are about the structure of 𝔽^∞ and the definition of dimension. The problem doesn't mention any specific conditions on 𝔽, so we assume 𝔽 is a field (like real or complex numbers).\n\nSo, the formatted problem should list these assumptions, each on one line, and then the problem statement.",
