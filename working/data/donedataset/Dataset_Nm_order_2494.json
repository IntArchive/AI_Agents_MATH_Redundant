    "Content": "How can I prove this: Finite rings without zero divisors are division rings. I know how to prove it when the ring has $1$, but I have no idea if my ring needs to have an unity.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since this statement of the question clearly goes haywire if we allow $\\{0\\}$ to be admitted, I'll be working under the assumption that the ring has at least one element other than zero. I guess also that \"without zero divisors\" is meant to eliminate both left and right zero divisors. (Update: it occurred to me later how to show a ring with no nonzero zero divisors has no nonzero one sided zero divisors. If $ab=0$ for nonzero $a,b$, then $ba\\neq 0$ and $(ba)^2=0$, a contradiction. So, no one sided zero divisors exist. ) Notice multiplication by nonzero elements must permute the finite set of nonzero elements of the ring. Let $a$ be any nonzero element. There exists a $b$ such that $ab=a$. Automatically, $aba=a^2$ implies $ba=a$ as well. $b$ is our candidate for identity. Now let $c$ be arbitrary and nonzero. There exists a $d$ such that $da=c$. But then $c=da=dab=cb$ implies $c=cb$ and again this leads to $c^2=cbc$and $bc=c$. Thus $b$ acts as an identity for arbitrary nonzero elements. It trivially acts as an identity for $0$. Thus $b$ is the identity for the ring. Here's another amusing proof. Call this ring $R$ and look at the Dorroh extension $\\Bbb Z\\times R=\\{(z,r)\\mid z\\in \\Bbb Z, r\\in R\\}$. In case you're not familiar with it, addition is $(z,r)+(z',r')=(z+z',r+r')$ and multiplication is $(z,r)(z',r')=(zz',zr'+z'r+rr')$. It creates a new ring $R_1$ which has $R$ as an ideal. Since $R^2=R$ and $R$ is finitely generated, we can apply Nakayama's lemma to $R$ to get the existence of an element $x\\in R$ such that $(1-x)R=\\{0\\}$. Unpacking that, we see that $x$ is a left identity element of $R$. Doing the same thing on the right, there is a right identity (necessarily also $x$.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that finite rings without zero divisors are division rings. They mentioned they know how to do it when the ring has unity but are unsure if the ring must have unity. \n\nFirst, I need to recall definitions. A division ring is a ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. The problem states the ring is finite and has no zero divisors. The key question is whether such a ring necessarily has unity, making it a division ring.\n\nThe example given in the original problem included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be about the ring: it's finite, has no zero divisors. But the user is questioning the necessity of unity. \n\nSo, the assumptions should list each property of the ring. Each assumption on a separate line. The problem is to prove it's a division ring. However, in standard ring theory, some authors require rings to have unity by definition, while others don't. The confusion here might stem from whether the ring without unity but with no zero divisors and finite can still be a division ring (which by definition needs unity). \n\nBut the statement claims that finite rings without zero divisors are division rings. If the ring doesn't have unity, it can't be a division ring. So maybe the problem implicitly assumes the ring has unity? But the user is asking about that. Wait, perhaps the actual theorem is that a finite ring without zero divisors must have unity, hence being a division ring. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in a finite ring without zero divisors, even if it's not assumed to have unity, the structure forces the existence of unity. For example, in finite rings, the absence of zero divisors implies each element is a unit, but units require a unity element. So perhaps the existence of unity can be proven from the other conditions. \n\nThus, the assumptions should be: the ring is finite, the ring has no zero divisors. The problem is to prove it's a division ring, which would include showing the existence of unity. The user's confusion is about whether the ring must have unity, so the formatted problem needs to include the necessary assumptions without assuming unity exists. Therefore, the assumptions are just that it's a finite ring without zero divisors, and the problem is to prove it's a division ring (which includes having unity).",
