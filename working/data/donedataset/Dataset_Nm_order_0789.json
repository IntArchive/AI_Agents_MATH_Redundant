    "Content": "How can I show that the units $u$ of $R=\\mathbb Z[\\sqrt{2}]$ with $u>1$ are $(1+ \\sqrt{2})^{n}$ ? I have proved that the right ones are units because their module is one, and it is said to me to do it by induction on $b$ and multiplication by $-1+\\sqrt{2}$. I have already shown that the units of this ring has norm $1$ and all the numbers with norm $1$ are units, this may help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, note that $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ is a unit if and only if $a^2-2b^2=\\pm1$. Use that to show that if $b\\neq 0$ then $|b|\\leq |a|< 2|b|$. Now we first restrict ourselves to $a,b\\geq 0$, and prove by induction on $b$. If $b=0$ then $a=\\pm 1$, and $u>0$ implies $a=1$, so $u=(1+\\sqrt 2)^0$. If $a,b>0$ and $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ is a unit, then $$(a+b\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{2}-1) = (2b-a)+(a-b)\\sqrt{2}$$\nis also a unit. Since we know that $b\\leq a< 2b$ and $b<a$,  we have that $2b-a>0$ and $0<a-b<b$, so by induction: $$(a+b\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{2}-1) =(1+\\sqrt{2})^n$$ But multiplying both sides by $1+\\sqrt{2}$ you get: $$a+b\\sqrt{2}=(1+\\sqrt{2})^{n+1}$$ Then you have to deal with the case where one of $a,b$ is negative...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the original question. The user is asking about showing that the units u of R = ℤ[√2] with u > 1 are of the form (1 + √2)^n. \n\nThe question mentions that the user has already proved that elements with norm 1 are units and vice versa. So one assumption here is that all units in R have a norm of 1. Additionally, the user refers to using induction on b and multiplication by -1 + √2. Maybe that's part of the method they need to use, but since the problem is about showing the structure of the units, the key assumptions would relate to the properties of the ring and the units.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed as separate lines, each addressing one property or condition. So for this problem:\n\n1. The ring in question is R = ℤ[√2].\n2. u is a unit of R.\n3. u > 1.\n4. All units in R have norm 1.\n5. Numbers in R with norm 1 are units.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the user has already shown that units have norm 1 and that numbers with norm 1 are units. So those are established facts, which might be part of the problem's given conditions or lemmas. However, in the example provided, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". The example added an assumption that wasn't in the original, perhaps as part of the problem's hidden conditions. But in this case, the user is explicitly stating that they've already proven that units have norm 1 and vice versa. Should those be included as assumptions?\n\nThe problem is to show that units u > 1 are powers of (1 + √2). The assumptions needed would be the structure of the ring and the properties of units in it. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe problem says: \"How can I show that the units u of R=ℤ[√2] with u>1 are (1+√2)^n?\" The user mentions that they proved units have norm 1 and all numbers with norm 1 are units, which helps. The hints given are to use induction on b and multiplication by -1 + √2.\n\nSo the key assumptions here would be:\n\n- R is ℤ[√2].\n- u is a unit of R.\n- u > 1.\n- Units in R have norm ±1, but since the user specifies norm 1, maybe considering only units with norm 1. Wait, in ℤ[√2], the norm is N(a + b√2) = a² - 2b². Units have norm ±1. But the user says they have already shown that units have norm 1. Wait, maybe they are considering only the positive units? Or perhaps the problem is in the context where units with norm 1 are considered, and the others can be obtained via multiplication by -1. The user mentions \"units u of R with u > 1\", so u is a unit greater than 1. So the norm of u must be 1, because if the norm were -1, then u would have to be a unit, but perhaps in this case, units with u > 1 must have norm 1. Let me check: If u > 1 and u is a unit, then its inverse must be in the ring. The inverse of u would be u', where u * u' = 1. If u has norm -1, then u' would be -conjugate(u). But if u is greater than 1, maybe its conjugate is negative? For example, take u = 1 + √2, its conjugate is 1 - √2, which is negative. So perhaps units greater than 1 must have norm 1. Therefore, the assumption here is that units u with u > 1 have norm 1. But the user says they have already proved that units have norm 1 and numbers with norm 1 are units, so that's a given. Therefore, the problem's assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- R is the ring ℤ[√2],\n- u is a unit in R,\n- u > 1,\n- All units in R have norm 1,\n- Numbers in R with norm 1 are units.\n\nWait, but \"All units in R have norm 1\" and \"Numbers in R with norm 1 are units\" might be part of the problem's premises, so they should be listed as assumptions. However, the original problem's user has already proven those, so they are given conditions for this problem. Therefore, the assumptions section should include those.\n\nThen the problem is to show that such units u > 1 are precisely the powers of (1 + √2).\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nAssumption:\n- R is the ring ℤ[√2],\n- u is a unit in R,\n- u > 1,\n- All units in R have norm 1,\n- An element in R is a unit if and only if it has norm 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that every unit u of R with u > 1 is of the form (1 + √2)^n for some integer n.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned using induction on b and multiplication by -1 + √2. Maybe those are hints or methods, not assumptions. The problem is as stated, and the assumptions are the given conditions. So the assumptions include the ring structure, u being a unit greater than 1, and the characterization of units via norm 1.",
