    "Content": "Question_ Prove that $$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\int_1^t \\sin(x) \\sin(x^2) \\, dx$$ converges. I think the indefinite integration of $\\sin(x)\\sin(x^2)$ is impossible. Besides, I've wondered whether the definite integration of it is possible or not. I've tried to use the condition that $t \\to \\infty$ . The one that came up to my mind is to use partial integration. When using it, we can have: $$\\int_{1}^{t}\\sin(x)\\sin(x^2) \\, dx=-\\left[ \\sin(x^2) \\cos(x) \\right]_1^t + \\int_1^t 2x\\cos(x^2)\\sin(x) \\, dx$$ However, since $\\sin(t^2)\\cos(t)$ diverges as $t \\to \\infty$ , I couldn't determine whether the given integration diverges or not. Due to this, I re-tried to have partial integration in a quite different way: $$\\int_1^t \\sin(x)\\sin(x^2) \\, dx=\\int_1^t \\frac{\\sin(x)}{2x}(2x\\sin(x^2)) \\, dx=-\\left[\\frac{\\sin(x)}{2x} \\cos(x^2)\\right]_1^t + \\int_1^t \\frac{x\\cos(x)-\\sin(x)}{2x^2} \\cos(x^2) \\, dx$$ In this case, $\\left[\\sin(t)\\cos(t^2)/2t\\right]$ goes to $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$ .  Therefore, it is enough to see the integration part only. Unfortunately, I'm stuck here. Could you give me some key ideas that can investigate whether $$\\int_{1}^{t}\\frac{x\\cos(x)-\\sin(x)}{2x^2}\\cos(x^2)dx$$ converges or not? The other way of solution is also welcome! Thanks for your advice.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that the limit as t approaches infinity of the integral from 1 to t of sin(x)sin(x²) dx converges. The user mentioned that indefinite integration might be impossible, which I agree with because integrating products of oscillating functions with different frequencies can be tricky. They tried integration by parts twice, and I need to check those attempts and see if there's another approach.\n\nFirst, looking at their first integration by parts: they set u = sin(x²) and dv = sin(x) dx, which leads to du = 2x cos(x²) dx and v = -cos(x). That gives the boundary terms [ -sin(x²)cos(x) ] from 1 to t and an integral involving 2x cos(x²) sin(x). But they noticed that as t approaches infinity, sin(t²)cos(t) doesn't settle to a value because sin(t²) oscillates rapidly and cos(t) also oscillates. So the boundary term here doesn't necessarily vanish, making this approach inconclusive.\n\nThen they tried another integration by parts, this time setting u = sin(x)/(2x) and dv = 2x sin(x²) dx. That makes du = [ (cos(x) * 2x - sin(x)*2 ) / (4x²) ] dx? Wait, no. Let me compute that derivative properly. If u = sin(x)/(2x), then du/dx = [ cos(x) * 2x - sin(x) * 2 ] / (2x)^2? Wait, no. Wait, derivative of sin(x)/(2x) is [ cos(x)*2x - sin(x)*2 ] / (4x²)? No, actually, using the quotient rule: derivative of sin(x)/(2x) is [ cos(x)*(2x) - sin(x)*2 ] / (4x²). Wait, no. Wait, let's compute it step by step.\n\nIf u = sin(x)/(2x), then du/dx = [ cos(x)*(2x) - sin(x)*2 ] / (2x)^2? Wait, no. Let me think. The derivative of sin(x)/(2x) is (cos(x)*(2x) - sin(x)*2) divided by (2x)^2? Wait, that's not right. Wait, no. The derivative of (sin x)/(2x) is [ (cos x * 2x) - sin x * 2 ] divided by (2x)^2? Wait, no. Wait, more accurately, using the quotient rule: if u = numerator = sin x, denominator = 2x, so derivative is [ (cos x * 2x) - sin x * 2 ] / (2x)^2. Yes, that's correct. So simplifying, that's [ 2x cos x - 2 sin x ] / (4x²) = [ x cos x - sin x ] / (2x²). Which matches what they have in their integral: [x cos x - sin x ] / (2x²) times cos(x²) dx.\n\nSo after integrating by parts the second time, the boundary term becomes [ sin(x) cos(x²) / (2x) ] from 1 to t. As t approaches infinity, sin(t) cos(t²) / (2t) goes to zero because sin(t) is bounded between -1 and 1, cos(t²) is also bounded, and 1/(2t) tends to zero. So the boundary term at infinity goes away, leaving only the integral from 1 to infinity of [ x cos x - sin x ] / (2x²) * cos(x²) dx.\n\nNow, the user is stuck on whether this remaining integral converges. Let me analyze this integral. The integrand is [x cos x - sin x]/(2x²) * cos(x²). Let's simplify the expression:\n\nFirst, [x cos x - sin x]/(2x²) = [ cos x / (2x) - sin x/(2x²) ].\n\nSo the integral becomes [cos x/(2x) - sin x/(2x²)] * cos(x²) dx. Let's split this into two terms:\n\n(1/2) ∫ cos x cos(x²)/x dx - (1/2) ∫ sin x cos(x²)/x² dx.\n\nWe need to check the convergence of each of these integrals from 1 to infinity.\n\nFor the first integral: (1/2) ∫_{1}^{∞} cos x cos(x²)/x dx.\n\nFor the second integral: -(1/2) ∫_{1}^{∞} sin x cos(x²)/x² dx.\n\nLet's start with the second integral. The integrand is sin x cos(x²)/x². The denominator is x², so the magnitude is bounded by |sin x cos(x²)| /x² ≤ 1/x². Since ∫_{1}^{∞} 1/x² dx converges (it's a p-integral with p=2 >1), the second integral converges absolutely by comparison test.\n\nNow, the first integral is (1/2) ∫ cos x cos(x²)/x dx. This is trickier because the denominator is x, which is like 1/x, and ∫_{1}^{∞} |cos x cos(x²)|/x dx ≤ ∫ 1/x dx, which diverges. However, the integral might converge conditionally if the oscillations lead to cancellation.\n\nTo handle integrals involving oscillatory functions, we can use the Dirichlet test. The Dirichlet test says that if f(x) is decreasing to zero and g(x) has bounded integral over [a, ∞), then ∫ f(x)g(x) dx converges.\n\nAlternatively, for integrals of the form ∫ u(x) v(x) dx, if u(x) is monotonic and tends to zero, and the integral of v(x) is bounded, then the integral converges.\n\nBut here, the integrand is cos x cos(x²)/x. Let's see if we can rewrite this product using trigonometric identities. For example, product of cosines can be expressed as sum:\n\ncos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)]/2.\n\nSo applying this:\n\ncos x cos(x²) = [cos(x² + x) + cos(x² - x)]/2.\n\nThus, the first integral becomes (1/2) * (1/2) ∫ [cos(x² + x) + cos(x² - x)] / x dx = (1/4) [ ∫ cos(x² +x)/x dx + ∫ cos(x² -x)/x dx ].\n\nNow, let's analyze each integral separately. Let me consider ∫ cos(x² + x)/x dx from 1 to ∞. Let's make a substitution for each.\n\nFirst, for the integral ∫ cos(x² + x)/x dx. Let’s consider substitution for the argument of cosine. Let’s take u = x² + x. Then du/dx = 2x + 1. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, for integrals of the form ∫ cos(ax² + bx + c) dx, sometimes methods like stationary phase or substitution can be used.\n\nAlternatively, for large x, x² +x ≈ x², so maybe we can approximate, but that's not rigorous. Instead, let's consider substitution to make it look like a standard Fresnel integral.\n\nLet me consider the integral ∫ cos(x² + x)/x dx. Let's try to write x² +x as (x + 0.5)^2 - 0.25. Completing the square:\n\nx² + x = x² + x + 0.25 - 0.25 = (x + 0.5)^2 - 0.25.\n\nSo cos(x² + x) = cos[(x + 0.5)^2 - 0.25] = cos((x + 0.5)^2) cos(0.25) + sin((x + 0.5)^2) sin(0.25).\n\nBut this might not help much. Alternatively, maybe use substitution u = x + 0.5, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, notice that as x becomes large, the term x² dominates, so the integral behaves similarly to ∫ cos(x²)/x dx. Let's check if that integral converges.\n\n∫_{1}^{∞} cos(x²)/x dx. Let’s substitute y = x², so dy = 2x dx, so dx = dy/(2√y). Then the integral becomes ∫_{1}^{∞} cos(y)/(√y) * (1/(2√y)) dy = (1/2) ∫_{1}^{∞} cos(y)/y dy. But ∫_{1}^{∞} cos(y)/y dy is the cosine integral, which converges conditionally by Dirichlet test: 1/y decreases to 0, and ∫ cos(y) dy is bounded. Therefore, ∫_{1}^{∞} cos(y)/y dy converges. So ∫ cos(x²)/x dx also converges.\n\nBut in our case, the integrand is cos(x² +x)/x. The difference between x² +x and x² is x, which grows, but the substitution might not be straightforward. However, maybe we can still apply the Dirichlet test here. Let's see:\n\nThe function 1/x is decreasing to zero. The other part is cos(x² +x). To apply Dirichlet's test, we need to show that ∫_{A}^{B} cos(x² +x) dx is bounded for all B > A > 1.\n\nBut how to show that? Let's make a substitution. Let u = x² + x. Then du/dx = 2x +1, so dx = du/(2x +1). So ∫ cos(u) du/(2x +1). But x in terms of u is not straightforward. However, for large x, 2x +1 ~ 2x, and x ~ sqrt(u), so du ~ 2x dx, so dx ~ du/(2sqrt(u)). But this is getting too heuristic.\n\nAlternatively, use the method of stationary phase or oscillatory integrals. The integral ∫ cos(x² + x) dx can be rewritten by substituting a variable to eliminate the linear term. Let’s try substitution:\n\nLet’s set y = x + 0.5. Then x = y - 0.5. Then x² +x = (y - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5) = y² - y + 0.25 + y - 0.5 = y² - 0.25. Wait, that's interesting! x² +x = y² - 0.25 where y = x + 0.5.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nx² +x = x² + x + 0.25 - 0.25 = (x + 0.5)^2 - 0.25. Right. So cos(x² +x) = cos((x + 0.5)^2 - 0.25) = cos((x + 0.5)^2) cos(0.25) + sin((x + 0.5)^2) sin(0.25).\n\nTherefore, ∫ cos(x² +x)/x dx = ∫ [cos((x + 0.5)^2) cos(0.25) + sin((x + 0.5)^2) sin(0.25)] /x dx.\n\nBut this splits into two integrals:\n\ncos(0.25) ∫ cos((x + 0.5)^2)/x dx + sin(0.25) ∫ sin((x + 0.5)^2)/x dx.\n\nLet’s substitute z = x + 0.5, so x = z - 0.5. Then dz = dx, and when x approaches infinity, z approaches infinity. The lower limit when x=1 is z=1.5. So the integral becomes:\n\ncos(0.25) ∫_{1.5}^{∞} cos(z²)/(z - 0.5) dz + sin(0.25) ∫_{1.5}^{∞} sin(z²)/(z - 0.5) dz.\n\nFor large z, z - 0.5 ~ z, so the integrals behave like ∫ cos(z²)/z dz and ∫ sin(z²)/z dz. Again, substituting y = z², dy = 2z dz, so dz = dy/(2√y). Then ∫ cos(z²)/z dz becomes ∫ cos(y)/√y * (1/(2√y)) dy = (1/2) ∫ cos(y)/y dy, which converges conditionally. Similarly for the sine term. Hence, these integrals converge conditionally.\n\nTherefore, the original integral ∫ cos(x² +x)/x dx converges conditionally. Similarly, the other integral ∫ cos(x² -x)/x dx can be analyzed similarly. Let me check x² -x:\n\nx² -x = x² -x + 0.25 -0.25 = (x - 0.5)^2 -0.25. So similar substitution would apply, leading to the same conclusion that the integral converges conditionally.\n\nTherefore, both integrals ∫ cos(x² ±x)/x dx converge, so their sum converges, and hence the first integral (1/4 times that sum) converges. Therefore, the remaining integral after integration by parts converges.\n\nPutting it all together, the original integral after integration by parts is equal to a boundary term that tends to zero plus a convergent integral. Therefore, the original integral converges as t approaches infinity.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, which states that if f(x) is absolutely integrable on [a, ∞), then ∫ f(x) e^{i k x} dx tends to zero as k tends to infinity. But here, the oscillation is at x², which is a quadratic phase, not linear. However, integrals with quadratic phases like ∫ cos(x²) dx are known to converge (Fresnel integrals), but I'm not sure if that directly helps here.\n\nAnother idea is to use substitution for the x² term. For example, let u = x², then du = 2x dx. But in the original integral, we have sin(x) sin(x²) dx. If we set u = x², then du = 2x dx, so dx = du/(2√u). But then the integral becomes ∫ sin(√u) sin(u) * du/(2√u) from u=1 to u=t². Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the identity sin(a)sin(b) = [cos(a-b) - cos(a+b)]/2. Applying this to sin(x)sin(x²):\n\nsin(x) sin(x²) = [cos(x² - x) - cos(x² + x)]/2.\n\nSo the original integral becomes (1/2) ∫_{1}^{t} [cos(x² - x) - cos(x² + x)] dx.\n\nNow, we need to analyze the convergence of each integral ∫ cos(x² -x) dx and ∫ cos(x² +x) dx from 1 to infinity.\n\nAs we did before, these integrals can be analyzed by substitution. Let's take the first one: ∫ cos(x² -x) dx. Let’s complete the square:\n\nx² - x = (x - 0.5)^2 - 0.25.\n\nLet u = x - 0.5, then x = u + 0.5, dx = du. The integral becomes ∫ cos(u² - 0.25) du. But this is similar to the Fresnel integral, which converges as u approaches infinity. The integral ∫ cos(u²) du from 0 to infinity converges to √(π/8), so the integral ∫ cos(u² - 0.25) du from some lower limit to infinity would also converge. However, when changing variables back, we need to consider the behavior.\n\nAlternatively, for integrals of the form ∫ cos(x² + ax + b) dx, the leading term as x→infty is x², so the integral oscillates but the amplitude doesn't decay, but the integral can still converge due to increasingly rapid oscillations leading to cancellation. This is similar to the Fresnel integral.\n\nTherefore, ∫ cos(x² ±x) dx from 1 to infinity converges, and hence their difference multiplied by 1/2 also converges. Therefore, the original integral converges.\n\nAlternatively, we can use substitution to express these integrals in terms of Fresnel integrals. For example, for ∫ cos(x² +x) dx, completing the square as before:\n\nx² + x = (x + 0.5)^2 - 0.25. Let u = x + 0.5, then the integral becomes ∫ cos(u² - 0.25) du. The integral of cos(u² - c) from some lower limit to infinity will converge because the integral of cos(u²) converges.\n\nTherefore, splitting the original integral into two convergent integrals gives the result that the original integral converges.\n\nSo the conclusion is that after integration by parts, the remaining integral converges, hence the original integral converges as t approaches infinity.",
