    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that for $|x| < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $$ \\frac{\\log\\cos x}{\\log^2 \\cos x + x^2} = \\Re \\frac{1}{\\log\\left( \\frac{1+e^{2ix}}{2} \\right)}. $$ Thus if $I$ denotes the given integral, we have \\begin{align*}\nI\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\Re \\frac{1}{\\log\\left( \\frac{1+e^{2ix}}{2} \\right)} \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{PV}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\Re \\frac{1}{\\log\\left( \\frac{1+e^{ix}}{2} \\right)} \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\Re \\mathrm{PV}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\frac{1}{\\log\\left( \\frac{1+e^{ix}}{2} \\right)} \\, dx.\n\\end{align*} Now let $C_{\\epsilon}$ be the counter-clockwised contour consisting of the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, with two semicircular indents $\\gamma_{1,\\epsilon}$ around $1$ and $\\gamma_{2,\\epsilon}$ around $-1$ as follows: By writing \\begin{align*}\nI = \\frac{1}{4} \\Re \\lim_{\\delta\\to0^{+}}\\left( \\int_{-\\pi+\\delta}^{-\\delta} + \\int_{\\delta}^{\\pi-\\delta} \\right) \\frac{1}{\\log\\left( \\frac{1+e^{ix}}{2} \\right)} \\, dx\n\\end{align*} and plugging the substitution $z = e^{ix}$, we observe that \\begin{align*}\nI = \\frac{1}{4} \\Im \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^{+}}\\left(\\oint_{C_{\\epsilon}} - \\int_{\\gamma_{1,\\epsilon}} - \\int_{\\gamma_{2,\\epsilon}} \\right) \\frac{dz}{z \\log\\left(\\frac{1+z}{2}\\right)}\n\\end{align*} Let \\begin{align*}\nf(z) = \\frac{1}{z \\log\\left(\\frac{1+z}{2}\\right)}.\n\\end{align*} It is plain from the logarithmic singularity that \\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\int_{\\gamma_{2,\\epsilon}} f(z) \\, dz = 0.\n\\end{align*} Also it follows that \\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^{+}} \\oint_{C_{\\epsilon}} f(z) \\, dz\n&= 2\\pi i \\operatorname{Res}_{z=0} f(z)\n = -\\frac{2\\pi i}{\\log 2}, \\\\\n\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^{+}} \\int_{\\gamma_{1,\\epsilon}} f(z) \\, dz\n&= -\\pi i \\operatorname{Res}_{z=1} f(z)\n = -2\\pi i.\n\\end{align*} Therefore we have \\begin{align*}\nI\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\Im \\left( 2\\pi i - \\frac{2\\pi i}{\\log 2} \\right)\n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\log 2} \\right).\n\\end{align*}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user provided an example where they extracted assumptions and the problem statement from an original question. I need to do the same for the definite integral problem from Math Stack Exchange.\n\nFirst, the title is: \"Definite Integral ∫₀^{π/2} [log(cos x)/(x² + log²(cos x))] dx = (π/2)(1 - 1/log 2)\". The question states they want to prove that integral equals the given expression.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral is from 0 to π/2. The integrand is log(cos x) divided by (x² + log²(cos x)). The result involves π/2 and log 2. \n\nWhat assumptions can I list here? The problem is a definite integral, so the main assumptions would be about the limits of integration and the functions involved. The integrand must be defined and integrable over [0, π/2]. Let's check if there are any specific conditions needed for the integral to converge or for the substitution to work. The logarithm of cos x: since cos x is positive in [0, π/2), except at π/2 where it's zero. So log(cos x) approaches -infinity as x approaches π/2. But the denominator has x² + log²(cos x), which would go to infinity. So the integrand near π/2 behaves like log(cos x)/log²(cos x) = 1/log(cos x), which tends to 0. So the integral is convergent. Maybe an assumption is that the integral converges. But the problem statement likely assumes the integral is well-defined. Alternatively, the function is continuous on [0, π/2) and has a limit at π/2. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2].\n- The integrand is defined as \\(\\frac{\\log(\\cos x)}{x^2 + \\log^2(\\cos x)}\\).\n- The logarithm function is the natural logarithm (since it's common in integrals, but the answer involves log 2, which could be natural log or base 10. Wait, in mathematics, log usually is natural log, but sometimes in specific contexts, base 10. However, here the result has 1/log 2. If log is natural, then log 2 is ln 2, which would make sense. If it were base 10, it would need to be specified. So maybe an assumption is that log denotes the natural logarithm. But the problem statement might not specify, so maybe that's an assumption to list.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumptions are about the variables and functions involved. Let me list them:\n\n1. The integral is with respect to x from 0 to π/2.\n2. The logarithm function used is the natural logarithm.\n3. The integrand is \\(\\frac{\\log(\\cos x)}{x^2 + (\\log(\\cos x))^2}\\).\n4. The integral converges (though this might be part of what needs to be proven, but the problem just asks to compute it, assuming it's valid).\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is to prove the equality. So the user probably assumes that the integral is well-defined. The example's assumptions included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is about an integral, so the assumptions would be the domain of integration and the definitions of the functions involved. Let me check the example again: the original problem had A(n) defined, and the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the variables are x from 0 to π/2, log is natural log, cos x is in the domain where log is defined (i.e., cos x > 0), which holds for x in [0, π/2). At x=π/2, cos x is 0, but the integrand approaches 0 as discussed. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real variable in the interval [0, π/2].\n- The function \\(\\log(\\cos x)\\) is defined for all x in [0, π/2).\n- The integral is convergent.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't need to state convergence as an assumption, as it's part of proving the result. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem statement already mentioned \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, the assumptions should list:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2].\n- The logarithm function is the natural logarithm.\n- The integrand is \\(\\frac{\\log(\\cos x)}{x^2 + (\\log(\\cos x))^2}\\).\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't specify the base of the logarithm. However, the answer involves log 2, which is likely natural log. If the problem uses log base 10, the result would be different. So it's crucial to assume that log is natural. Therefore, that's an important assumption.\n\nPutting it all together, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, π/2],\nThe logarithm function is the natural logarithm,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{\\log(\\cos x)}{x^2 + \\log^2(\\cos x)}\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\log(\\cos x)}{x^2 + \\log^2(\\cos x)}dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\log 2}\\right)$$\n\nI think that's the correct way to structure it. The example had assumptions that were properties of the variable and conditions. Here, the key assumptions are the interval, the logarithm base, and the form of the integrand. The problem is to prove the integral equals that expression.",
