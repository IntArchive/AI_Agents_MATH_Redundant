    "Content": "I cannot prove this statement so need help.\nThis problem is one of exercises right after the chapter about Hausdorff's maximal principle and Zorn's Lemma. Thus, you cannot use the concept of cardinal number . I found the exact same question on this website, but the proof is done by using the concept of cardinal number .\nPlease make sure that this question is at right after introducing the axiom of choice and Zorn's lemma. Let $A$ be any set with more than one element. Prove that there exists a bijective function $f:A \\to A$ such that $f(x)\\neq x$ for every element $x$ in $A$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Order the bijective functions $f\\colon A\\to A$ such that $f\\le g$ if all fixed points of $g$ are fixed points of $f$ and $f$ and $g$ agree on all elements that aren't fixed points of $f$. Given a chain with respect to this partial order, an upper bound is given by the function that has fixed points where all elements of the chain have fixed points and maps every other element to the unique element that some elements of the chain map it to. Thus by Zorn's lemma there is a maximal element with respect to this partial order. If this maximal element had at least two fixed points, we could map those two fixed points to each other to create a greater element. Thus the maximal element $f$ has at most one fixed point $x$, and if so we can choose some other element $a$ and define $g$ to coincide with $f$ except $g(a)=x$ and $g(x)=f(a)$. Then $g$ has no fixed points.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that every set with more than one element has a permutation without fixed points, without using cardinal numbers. The user mentioned that the chapter just covered Hausdorff's maximal principle and Zorn's Lemma, so the solution should use those instead.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that the set A has more than one element. Also, the proof should not use cardinal numbers but rely on Zorn's Lemma or the Hausdorff maximal principle. Additionally, the function f needs to be bijective and have no fixed points. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or object.\n\nLet me check the example given. The example listed each assumption separately: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So here, for the set A, the assumptions would be that A is a set, A has more than one element, and the problem is to find a bijection with no fixed points using Zorn's Lemma. The constraints about not using cardinal numbers and the chapter context are important assumptions too.\n\nWait, but how to structure those constraints? The original problem mentions that the proof is right after the chapter on Zorn's Lemma, so we can't use cardinal numbers. That's a constraint on the method, so it's an assumption about the allowed proof techniques. So the assumptions would include that the proof must use Zorn's Lemma or Hausdorff's maximal principle, and cannot use cardinal numbers. Also, A is a set with more than one element, and we need a bijection f: A → A with f(x) ≠ x for all x.\n\nSo each assumption line by line:\n\n- A is a set,\n- A has more than one element,\n- The proof must use Zorn's Lemma or Hausdorff's maximal principle,\n- The proof cannot use the concept of cardinal numbers,\n- The function f: A → A is bijective,\n- For every element x in A, f(x) ≠ x.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking to prove that such an f exists. So the assumptions are the conditions given (A is a set with more than one element, the proof method constraints), and the problem is to show the existence of the bijection with those properties. So the assumptions are the given conditions, not the properties of the solution. The problem is the actual statement to prove.\n\nSo in the example, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a set,\n- A has more than one element,\n- The proof must not use the concept of cardinal numbers,\n- The proof must use Zorn's Lemma or Hausdorff's maximal principle.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"you cannot use the concept of cardinal number\", so that's a constraint. Also, the problem is in a chapter right after introducing Zorn's lemma and the Hausdorff maximal principle. So the assumptions would include that context. But how to phrase them? The user says \"you cannot use the concept of cardinal number\", so that's a constraint on the proof method. Similarly, the problem is stated in the context where Zorn's lemma is available.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a set,\n- A has more than one element,\n- The proof must use Zorn's Lemma or Hausdorff's maximal principle,\n- The proof cannot use the concept of cardinal numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a bijective function f: A → A such that f(x) ≠ x for every x in A.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"you cannot use the concept of cardinal number\" as part of the problem's context. So those are part of the problem's conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should capture all given conditions and constraints. The problem is the actual statement to prove under those assumptions.\n\nI think that's correct. The problem is to prove the existence of such a bijection under the assumptions that A is a set with more than one element, and the proof must use Zorn's Lemma without invoking cardinal numbers.",
