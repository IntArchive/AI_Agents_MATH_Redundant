    "Content": "I know that If $\\{f_n\\}$ is an equicontinuous sequence,  defined on a compact metric space $K$, and for all $x$, $f_n(x)\\rightarrow f(x)$, then $f_n\\rightarrow f$ uniformly. I'm having trouble proving this.  I see the same problem here but am having trouble following the proof, particularly with part (3). Can someone guide me through a proof of this result?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\varepsilon>0$ , we shall show that there exists an $n_0=n_0(\\varepsilon)$ , such that, $$\nn\\ge n_0\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\lvert\\, f_n(x)-f(x)\\rvert<\\varepsilon,\n$$ for all $x\\in K$ . As $\\{f_n\\}$ is equicontinuous, there exists a $\\delta>0$ , such that for all $x,y\\in K$ : $$\nd(x,y)<\\delta\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\lvert\\, f_n(x)-f_n(y)\\rvert<\\frac{\\varepsilon}{3}, \\tag{1}\n$$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb N$ . If we let $n\\to\\infty$ , then $(1)$ implies that $$\nd(x,y)<\\delta\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\lvert\\, f(x)-f(y)\\rvert\\le \\frac{\\varepsilon}{3},\n$$ Since $K$ is compact, it can be covered by finitely many balls of radius $\\delta$ , i.e., there exist $k\\in\\mathbb N$ and $z_1,\\ldots,z_k\\in K$ , such that $$\nK\\subset B(z_1,\\delta)\\cup\\cdots\\cup B(z_k,\\delta).\n$$ As $f_n(z_j)\\to f(z_j)$ , for $j=1,\\ldots,k$ , we can find $n_0$ , such that $$\nn\\ge n_0\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\lvert\\, f_n(z_j)-f(z_j)\\rvert<\\frac\\varepsilon 3,\n$$ for all $j=1,\\ldots,k$ . Finally, if $x\\in K$ and $n\\ge n_0$ , then there exists a $j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$ , for which $x\\in B(z_j,\\delta)$ , and hence $$\n\\lvert\\, f_n(x)-f(x)\\rvert\\le \\lvert\\, f_n(x)-f_n(z_j)\\rvert\n+\\lvert\\, f_n(z_j)-f(z_j)\\rvert\n+\\lvert\\, f(z_j)-f(x)\\rvert<\n\\frac{\\varepsilon}{3}+\\frac{\\varepsilon}{3}+\\frac{\\varepsilon}{3}={\\varepsilon}.\n$$ Ὅπερ ἔδει δεῖξαι .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to structure the given math problem into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the key assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that if a sequence of functions {f_n} is equicontinuous on a compact metric space K, and if f_n converges pointwise to f on K, then the convergence is uniform. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The user mentioned that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The sequence {f_n} is equicontinuous. Equicontinuity is a property of the entire sequence, so that's one assumption about {f_n}.\n2. The domain K is a compact metric space. Compactness is a property of K.\n3. For every x in K, f_n(x) converges to f(x) pointwise. This is the pointwise convergence condition applied to each x in K.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that under these assumptions, the convergence is uniform on K.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the original problem had an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, that was listed as an assumption. So here, the key is to list all the given conditions as separate assumptions. Let me check again:\n\nThe problem states: \"If {f_n} is an equicontinuous sequence, defined on a compact metric space K, and for all x, f_n(x) → f(x), then f_n → f uniformly.\"\n\nSo the three assumptions are:\n\n- {f_n} is equicontinuous.\n- K is a compact metric space.\n- For all x in K, f_n(x) converges to f(x).\n\nTherefore, each of these should be a separate line under Assumption. The problem is to prove uniform convergence.\n\nI should make sure not to include any extra information from the question, like the user's mention of part (3) in another proof. The task is to structure the problem, not the user's difficulties with it.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have the three assumptions listed, each on a separate line, and the problem statement as proving uniform convergence.",
