    "Content": "Let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be two positive reals, $\\alpha \\lt \\beta$ (arbitrarily close). Is it true that there always exists an ordered pair of prime numbers, $(p, q)$ , such that $$ \\alpha \\lt \\frac{\\log(q)}{\\log(p)} \\lt \\beta $$ ? Context: I'm interested in classifying the natural numbers by their Factorization Patterns (FPs) and their Factorization Patterns of Sequences of Divisors (FPSDs), two kinds of symbolic signatures based on the prime factorization, where the order of the divisors matters; let's just provide self-explanatory examples: $$\\mbox{FP}(350)=\\mbox{FP}(2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7)=pq^2r$$ $$\\mbox{FP}(12)=\\mbox{FP}(20)=p^2q$$ $$\\mbox{FPSD}(12)=[1 \\lt p \\lt q \\lt p^2 \\lt pq \\lt p^2q]$$ $$\\mbox{FPSD}(20)=[1 \\lt p \\lt p^2 \\lt q \\lt pq \\lt p^2q]$$ The last 3 lines prove it's possible to find natural numbers with the same FP but with distinct FPSDs. Then comes the question: given an FP, how many distinct FPSD's for that FP can there exist? For example, is it worth looking for a $z$ , distinct from $12$ and $20$ such that $\\mbox{FP}(z)$ is also equal to $p^2q$ but such that $\\mbox{FPSD}(z)$ is neither $[1 \\lt p \\lt q \\lt p^2 \\lt pq \\lt p^2q]$ nor $[1 \\lt p \\lt p^2 \\lt q \\lt pq \\lt p^2q]$ ?\nMy work led me to arrangements of [vectorial] hyperplanes (by taking the logarithms) where the dimension is the number of distinct primes in the prime factorization of $z$ . In the case when the dimension is 2, the arrangement is just a drawing of lines passing through $(0,0)$ , like this: Conjecturally, there are as many FPSD for a given FP as there are colored regions. That supposes that every region contains at least one point with coordinates $(\\log(p),\\log(q))$ for some $(p,q)$ ordered pair of prime numbers, $p \\lt q$ . Since the number of delimiting lines tends to grow fast when the exponents $m$ and $n$ increase in $\\mbox{FP}=p^m q^n$ , the regions become thiner and thiner. Hence the asked question, which I was unsuccessful to prove. I'm wondering if it's a conjecture closer to Bertrand's conjecture (proved -- theorem of Chebychev) or to Goldbach's conjecture (still unproved). N.B.: this topic also deals with a entry in OEIS, that I'm writing, currently in draft status (A355474).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes. More strongly, we claim that, for any $\\alpha<\\beta$ , there exists some $N>0$ so that for all $p>N$ , there exists a prime $q$ with $\\alpha<\\frac{\\log q}{\\log p}<\\beta$ , i.e. with $p^\\alpha<q<p^\\beta$ . Let $N=2^{\\frac1{\\beta-\\alpha}}$ , so that for all $p>N$ $$p^\\beta\\geq N^{\\beta-\\alpha}p^\\alpha=2p^\\alpha.$$ Then, by Bertrand's postulate, there exists a prime $q$ between $p^\\alpha$ and $2p^\\alpha$ . Such a prime must also lie between $p^\\alpha$ and $p^\\beta$ . (If you're interested in more general factorization patterns, you can show using essentially the same logic that the set $$\\left\\{\\left(\\frac{\\log q_1}{\\log p},\\frac{\\log q_2}{\\log p},\\dots,\\frac{\\log q_n}{\\log p}\\right)\\colon p,q_1,\\dots,q_n\\text{ prime}\\right\\}$$ is dense in $\\mathbb R^n_{>0}$ for any $n$ .)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is asking if the ratios of logarithms of prime numbers are dense in the positive real numbers. The problem statement says: Given two positive reals α and β with α < β (and they can be arbitrarily close), is it always true that there exists a pair of primes (p, q) such that α < log(q)/log(p) < β? \n\nThe context provided talks about factorization patterns and some conjectures, but according to the example, I should filter out unrelated information. The user mentioned that in the example, the original problem had a divisibility condition, but the formatted problem included only the necessary assumptions. So here, the main assumptions are about α and β being positive reals with α < β, and the existence of primes p and q. The context about factorization patterns and OEIS entries is probably not needed for the assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each condition. The problem is whether for any α < β, there's a prime pair p, q with that ratio of logs. The assumptions would be:\n\n- α and β are positive real numbers.\n- α is less than β.\n- The pair (p, q) are prime numbers.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't state any restrictions on p and q other than being primes. The original question says \"ordered pair of prime numbers (p, q)\" but doesn't specify p < q or anything else. However, looking at the context, the user mentions \"ordered pair\" so maybe that's important. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just (p, q) as primes. The ratio is log(q)/log(p). Since α and β are arbitrary positive reals with α < β, but primes are integers. The ratio log(q)/log(p) is equivalent to log_p(q). So the question is whether these ratios are dense in R^+.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions needed are:\n\n- α is a positive real number.\n- β is a positive real number.\n- α < β.\n- p is a prime number.\n- q is a prime number.\n\nEach of these as separate lines. Then the problem is to prove that such a pair (p, q) exists with the ratio between α and β.\n\nWait, but in the original question, there's no restriction on α and β except being positive and α < β. So the key assumptions are that α and β are positive reals with α < β, and p, q are primes. The problem is whether there's always such a pair.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a positive real number,\nβ is a positive real number,\nα is less than β,\np is a prime number,\nq is a prime number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an ordered pair of prime numbers (p, q) such that α < log(q)/log(p) < β.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"Is it true that there always exists an ordered pair...\" So the problem is to prove the existence. The context mentions that the user was unsuccessful to prove it, and relates it to conjectures like Bertrand's or Goldbach's.\n\nBut per the example, the user wants to filter out the context. So the formatted problem should focus only on the core question and its assumptions. The context about factorization patterns, OEIS, etc., is extra info that can be excluded.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a positive real number,\nβ is a positive real number,\nα is less than β,\np is a prime number,\nq is a prime number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there always exists an ordered pair of prime numbers (p, q) such that α < (log q)/(log p) < β.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"ordered pair of prime numbers (p, q)\" so perhaps the order matters, i.e., p and q are primes but maybe p can be less than or greater than q? The ratio log(q)/log(p) can be greater or less than 1 depending on p and q. But in the problem statement, α and β are arbitrary positive reals, not necessarily greater than 1. So maybe even if p > q, the ratio can be less than 1. So the ordered pair allows both p < q and p > q. Therefore, the problem is to have the ratio in (α, β), regardless of the order. But in the problem statement, it's just (p, q) as ordered, so p and q can be any primes. So the assumptions are as above.\n\nI think that's correct. The example given by the user for the original problem had an assumption about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, there are no such restrictions except that α and β are positive reals with α < β, and p and q are primes. So the assumptions are just those four points: α is positive real, β is positive real, α < β, p and q are primes. Then the problem is to show existence of such a pair (p, q) with the ratio in that interval.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the formatted answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nα is a positive real number,\nβ is a positive real number,\nα is less than β,\np is a prime number,\nq is a prime number.\nProblem: \nProve that there always exists an ordered pair of prime numbers $(p, q)$ such that $$ \\alpha \\lt \\frac{\\log(q)}{\\log(p)} \\lt \\beta $$.",
