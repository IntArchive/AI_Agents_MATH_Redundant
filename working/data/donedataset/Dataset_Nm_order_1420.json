    "AcceptedAnswer": "$a(n)$ , the smallest $k$ such that the $n$ -th prime divides the sum of the first $k$ primes, is tabulated at http://oeis.org/A111287 . In the comments there, it says: It follows from a theorem of Daniel Shiu that $k$ always exists. Shiu has proved that if $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$ then the arithmetic progression $a, a + b, ..., a + kb, \\dots$ contains arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive primes. Since, for any positive integer $b$ , there are thus arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive primes congruent to 1 mod $b$ , there must be infinitely many $a(n)$ that are divisible by $b$ . To clarify the previous comment: If the sum of the primes up to some point is $s \\bmod b$ , then we need exactly $b-s$ consecutive primes equal to $1 \\bmod b$ to produce a sum divisible by $b$ . Hence when there are $b-1$ consecutive primes congruent to $1 \\bmod b$ , then the sum of primes up to one of those primes will be divisible by $b$ . [From T. D. Noe, Dec 02 2009]",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement is written clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: The title is \"Every prime number divide some sum of the first $k$ primes.\" The question defines $S_n$ as the sum of the first $n$ primes, and the conjecture is that for every prime $p$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $p$ divides $S_n$. They've verified this for the first 1000 primes and are asking for a general proof.\n\nIn the example given by the user, the original problem mentioned divisibility by 91, but in the formatted version, an assumption was added that $n$ is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user might have included an extra assumption that wasn't there. Wait, no—the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, maybe that was part of their own example, perhaps to split the assumptions. But in the actual problem here, the conjecture is for all primes p, there exists n such that p divides S_n. So the assumptions here would involve the definitions: S_n is the sum of the first n primes, p is a prime number, and we need to find n in natural numbers such that p divides S_n. But the problem as stated in the original question doesn't add extra conditions; the conjecture is for all primes p, so the only assumptions are that p is prime, S_n is the sum of the first n primes, and n is a natural number. However, in the example, sometimes they split into multiple assumptions. Let's check the example again.\n\nIn the user's example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91\". But in the formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. So maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the formatted problem shouldn't add \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would make the problem different. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow the structure regardless.\n\nBut perhaps the example was misrepresented. Alternatively, maybe the user is providing an example where they restructured the problem with assumptions even if the original problem didn't state them. Wait, maybe in the original problem, the user included an assumption that wasn't explicit but necessary. For instance, maybe the problem requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original statement was incorrect. Hmm. Anyway, the user's example shows that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they split into two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem becomes \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". So perhaps in that case, the user intended to add the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, even though the original problem didn't state it. That might be a mistake, but following their example, I need to structure the current problem similarly.\n\nNow, the current problem is about primes dividing the sum of the first k primes. The problem statement from the user's example seems to be the conjecture that for every prime p, there exists a natural number n such that p divides S_n. The user provided a table of n-values for different m, but those are perhaps examples or additional data. The question is asking if there's a general proof. The problem as stated in the original post is: \"Let S_n = sum_{k=1}^n p_k where p_k is the k-th prime. Conjecture: For all p in P, there exists n in N such that p divides S_n. Verified for the first 1000 primes. Is there a proof for this result in general?\"\n\nSo to format this according to the user's instructions, the assumptions would be:\n\n- S_n is the sum of the first n prime numbers.\n- p is a prime number.\n- n is a natural number.\n\nBut the problem is the conjecture: For every prime p, there exists a natural number n such that p divides S_n.\n\nBut in the example, they split the assumptions line by line. So in the example, the assumptions were:\n\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $p$ is a prime number.\n- $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ prime numbers.\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that for every prime number $p$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $p$ divides $S_n$.\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated in the original question is the conjecture. The user is asking if there's a proof. So the problem would be to prove the conjecture, given those assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just stating the conjecture as the problem, with the assumptions being the definitions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\", and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. Because if the problem is \"for every integer n\", then adding \"n is divisible by 7\" changes it to \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", which is a different problem. But maybe the example was a mistake. However, the user's instruction says to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem. So perhaps in the example, the original problem had an error, and the formatted version corrected it, but the user wants me to follow the structure even if the example is flawed.\n\nBut in the current problem, the conjecture is stated as \"for all p in P, exists n in N: p divides S_n\". So the assumptions would naturally be:\n\n- $p$ is a prime number (since the conjecture is for all p in P, where P is primes).\n- $S_n$ is defined as the sum of the first $n$ primes.\n- $n$ is a natural number.\n\nThus, the problem is to prove that such an $n$ exists for every prime $p$.\n\nThe other information in the question, like the table of n-records and comments about a stronger conjecture for all positive integers m, are probably unrelated to the core problem, so they should be filtered out.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list the assumptions as the definitions of p, S_n, and n, and the problem is the conjecture.",
