    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants to prove that (cscθ/cotθ) - (cotθ/cscθ) equals tanθ sinθ. They've already started working on the left side and converted everything into terms of sinθ and tanθ. Let me parse through their steps to see where they might be going right or wrong.\n\nFirst, they rewrote cscθ as 1/sinθ and cotθ as 1/tanθ. Wait, no, actually, when they wrote (1/sinθ)*(tanθ/1), that's because cscθ is 1/sinθ and cotθ is cosθ/sinθ, but maybe they converted cotθ to 1/tanθ? Wait, cotθ is indeed 1/tanθ, so that part is correct. Then they subtracted the two terms, resulting in tanθ/sinθ - sinθ/tanθ. \n\nNext, they tried to get a common denominator, which makes sense. So they rewrote both fractions with the denominator tanθ sinθ. The numerator becomes tan²θ - sin²θ. The user mentions that the denominator is the right side of the original problem, which is tanθ sinθ. So they're saying that after combining, the denominator is tanθ sinθ, which matches the right side's denominator. But the right side of the equation is tanθ sinθ, so maybe they need to manipulate the numerator tan²θ - sin²θ to get to something that simplifies to tanθ sinθ.\n\nLet me check their steps again. Starting with LS:\n\n(cscθ / cotθ) - (cotθ / cscθ)\n\nConvert cscθ to 1/sinθ and cotθ to cosθ/sinθ. Wait, actually, cotθ is cosθ/sinθ, which is 1/tanθ. So when they divide cscθ by cotθ, it's (1/sinθ) divided by (cosθ/sinθ) which is (1/sinθ) * (sinθ/cosθ) = 1/cosθ = secθ. Similarly, cotθ divided by cscθ is (cosθ/sinθ) divided by (1/sinθ) = cosθ. So then the expression becomes secθ - cosθ. But the user didn't take that approach. Instead, they converted cscθ and cotθ into terms of tanθ and sinθ. Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in their initial conversion. Let's verify each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: cscθ / cotθ = (1/sinθ) / (cosθ/sinθ) = (1/sinθ) * (sinθ/cosθ) = 1/cosθ = secθ.\n\nSecond term: cotθ / cscθ = (cosθ/sinθ) / (1/sinθ) = (cosθ/sinθ) * (sinθ/1) = cosθ.\n\nSo the left side is secθ - cosθ. Then secθ is 1/cosθ, so 1/cosθ - cosθ = (1 - cos²θ)/cosθ = sin²θ / cosθ. But sin²θ / cosθ is sinθ * (sinθ / cosθ) = sinθ tanθ, which is the right side. So that seems like a straightforward way. But the user didn't take that path; instead, they converted into tanθ and sinθ earlier. Let me see their steps again.\n\nThey wrote:\n\nLS = (cscθ / cotθ) - (cotθ / cscθ) = [ (1/sinθ) * (tanθ/1) ) ] - [ (1/tanθ) * (sinθ/1) ) ].\n\nWait, hold on. Let's parse the first term: cscθ divided by cotθ. cscθ is 1/sinθ, cotθ is cosθ/sinθ. So dividing them gives (1/sinθ) / (cosθ/sinθ) = (1/sinθ) * (sinθ/cosθ) = 1/cosθ = secθ. But the user wrote (1/sinθ) * (tanθ/1). Since tanθ is sinθ/cosθ, so substituting tanθ into that gives (1/sinθ) * (sinθ/cosθ) = 1/cosθ, which is correct. So their first term simplifies to tanθ/sinθ, which is (sinθ/cosθ)/sinθ = 1/cosθ = secθ. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the second term: cotθ divided by cscθ is (cotθ) / (cscθ) = (cosθ/sinθ) / (1/sinθ) = cosθ. But the user wrote (1/tanθ) * (sinθ/1). Since 1/tanθ is cotθ = cosθ/sinθ, so multiplying by sinθ gives cosθ. So their approach is also correct here. Therefore, their second term becomes sinθ/tanθ, which is sinθ divided by (sinθ/cosθ) = cosθ. So both terms are correct.\n\nSo they have tanθ/sinθ - sinθ/tanθ. Let's compute each term:\n\ntanθ/sinθ = (sinθ/cosθ)/sinθ = 1/cosθ = secθ.\n\nsinθ/tanθ = sinθ/(sinθ/cosθ) = cosθ.\n\nTherefore, the expression is secθ - cosθ, which is indeed equal to (1/cosθ) - cosθ = (1 - cos²θ)/cosθ = sin²θ/cosθ = sinθ * (sinθ/cosθ) = sinθ tanθ. So that's the right side. So the user is trying to get from their current step to the right side.\n\nBut in their steps, they combined the two fractions into [tan²θ - sin²θ]/(tanθ sinθ). Let's check that. The common denominator is tanθ sinθ. So:\n\ntanθ/sinθ = tanθ * tanθ / (tanθ sinθ) [Wait, no: To get the common denominator, they multiply numerator and denominator of the first term by tanθ, and the second term by sinθ. Wait, original terms are tanθ/sinθ and sinθ/tanθ. So to get a common denominator, you need to find a common denominator between sinθ and tanθ. Since tanθ = sinθ/cosθ, the denominators are sinθ and sinθ/cosθ. The common denominator would be sinθ (since sinθ/cosθ is the same as tanθ, but perhaps they multiplied numerator and denominator of the first term by tanθ and the second term by sinθ. Wait, let's see:\n\nFirst term: (tanθ/sinθ) becomes [tanθ * tanθ] / [sinθ * tanθ] = tan²θ / (sinθ tanθ).\n\nSecond term: (sinθ/tanθ) becomes [sinθ * sinθ] / [tanθ * sinθ] = sin²θ / (sinθ tanθ).\n\nSo when subtracted, it's [tan²θ - sin²θ]/(sinθ tanθ). Which is the same as the user's step: denominator is tanθ sinθ, numerator is tan²θ - sin²θ. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the user wants to get to tanθ sinθ. The denominator is tanθ sinθ, which is the right side. So the numerator must simplify to (tanθ sinθ) * denominator? Wait, no. Wait, the right side is tanθ sinθ. So the entire expression is [tan²θ - sin²θ]/(tanθ sinθ) = tanθ sinθ. Therefore, cross-multiplying, we get tan²θ - sin²θ = (tanθ sinθ)^2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the left side after combining is equal to the right side, so:\n\n[tan²θ - sin²θ]/(tanθ sinθ) = tanθ sinθ.\n\nMultiply both sides by (tanθ sinθ):\n\ntan²θ - sin²θ = (tanθ sinθ)^2.\n\nBut this seems like a complicated equation. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's see:\n\nFrom the user's step: [tan²θ - sin²θ]/(tanθ sinθ). Let's factor the numerator. tan²θ - sin²θ is a difference of squares, so it can be factored as (tanθ - sinθ)(tanθ + sinθ). But maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, express tanθ in terms of sinθ and cosθ.\n\ntanθ = sinθ/cosθ, so tan²θ = sin²θ / cos²θ. Therefore, the numerator becomes sin²θ / cos²θ - sin²θ = sin²θ (1/cos²θ - 1) = sin²θ ( (1 - cos²θ)/cos²θ ) = sin²θ (sin²θ / cos²θ ) = sin^4θ / cos²θ.\n\nThen the numerator is sin^4θ / cos²θ, and the denominator is (sinθ/cosθ) * sinθ = sin²θ / cosθ. Therefore, the entire expression is [sin^4θ / cos²θ] / [sin²θ / cosθ] = [sin^4θ / cos²θ] * [cosθ / sin²θ] = sin²θ / cosθ = sinθ * (sinθ / cosθ) = sinθ tanθ. Which is the right side. So that works.\n\nTherefore, the user is on the right track. They just need to simplify the numerator tan²θ - sin²θ by expressing tanθ in terms of sinθ and cosθ, then factor and simplify to get the desired result. Alternatively, as I did earlier, the simpler path is to recognize that LS simplifies to secθ - cosθ, which then becomes sinθ tanθ. But since the user is proceeding through their own method, guiding them to factor the numerator or express tanθ in terms of sin and cos would help.\n\nSo the assumptions here are related to trigonometric identities and the conditions under which they hold. The problem is to prove the identity given. The user hasn't mentioned any restrictions on θ, but typically in trigonometric identities, we assume θ is in the domain where all functions are defined (i.e., denominators aren't zero). So θ cannot be where sinθ, cosθ, cotθ, cscθ are zero or undefined. So θ ≠ kπ/2 for integer k, etc. But since the original problem doesn't specify, maybe the main assumption is that θ is in the domain where all expressions are defined.\n\nNow, structuring this according to the required format:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove the identity. So:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is a real number in the domain where all trigonometric functions in the equation are defined.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\dfrac{\\csc\\theta}{\\cot\\theta}-\\dfrac{\\cot\\theta}{\\csc\\theta}=\\tan\\theta\\sin\\theta$$\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the main assumption is about θ being in the valid domain. Since the problem is an identity, it's assumed to hold for all θ where the expressions are defined. Therefore, the assumption is that θ is such that none of the denominators are zero and the functions are defined.",
