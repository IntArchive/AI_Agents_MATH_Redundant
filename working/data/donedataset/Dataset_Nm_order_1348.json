    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to obtain the Laurent expansion of the gamma function around z=0. The given expansion starts with 1/z minus the Euler-Mascheroni constant gamma, then some terms with z and z^2, and higher-order terms. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the properties of the gamma function. The gamma function has poles at non-positive integers, so at z=0, it has a simple pole. That means the Laurent expansion around z=0 should have a term with 1/z. The user provided an expansion that includes 1/z, which makes sense.\n\nThe user mentioned two approaches: one using the integral definition of the gamma function and splitting it into two integrals, and another using the limit definition involving factorials. Let me think about each approach.\n\nStarting with the integral definition. The gamma function is split into an integral from 1 to infinity and from 0 to 1. The integral from 1 to infinity of e^{-t} t^{z-1} dt is analytic around z=0? Wait, when z is near 0, t^{z-1} is t^{-1} multiplied by t^z, which is analytic. So maybe that integral is analytic at z=0. Then the second integral, from 0 to 1, they expanded e^{-t} as a power series and integrated term by term, leading to a sum of 1/(z+n) multiplied by (-1)^n/n!. \n\nBut the user says this gives the gamma function as a function of 1/z. Wait, but the sum from n=0 to infinity of (-1)^n/(n! (z + n)) plus the integral from 1 to infinity. Since z is near 0, the terms with n=0 in the sum would have 1/z, which corresponds to the pole. The other terms would have 1/(z + n), which for n ≥ 1, when z is near 0, are like 1/n - z/n² + ..., so maybe expanding each term as a series in z? But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps combining these terms with the integral part to get the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, using the limit definition: Γ(z) = lim_{n→∞} n! n^z / [z(z+1)...(z+n)]. This is the Weierstrass definition. Maybe expanding each term in this product as a series in z. Since z is small, each term (z + k) in the denominator can be written as k(1 + z/k), so 1/(z + k) = 1/(k(1 + z/k)) = 1/k (1 - z/k + z²/k² - ...). Taking the product over k from 1 to n, maybe log the product and expand, then exponentiate. This could relate to the digamma function and the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The expansion would involve γ and other constants like ζ(3). \n\nAlternatively, using the known expansion of the gamma function around z=0. The Laurent series expansion of Γ(z) around z=0 is known to be Γ(z) = 1/z - γ + (γ²/2 + π²/12) z - (γ³/6 + γ π²/12 + ζ(3)/3) z² + O(z³). Wait, the user's expansion has coefficients: 1/z - γ + (γ² + π²/6)/2 z - (γ³ + γ π²/2 + 2 ζ(3))/6 z² + ... So maybe there's a discrepancy in coefficients. Let me check standard expansions.\n\nAccording to standard references, the Laurent expansion of Γ(z) around z=0 is:\n\nΓ(z) = 1/z - γ + (γ²/2 + π²/12) z - (γ³/6 + γ π²/12 + ζ(3)/3) z² + O(z³)\n\nComparing with the user's expansion:\n\nThe user's coefficient for z is (γ² + π²/6)/2, which is (γ²/2 + π²/12), matching the standard. Then the coefficient for z² is - (γ³ + γ π²/2 + 2 ζ(3))/6, which is - [ (γ³)/6 + (γ π²)/12 + (2 ζ(3))/6 ] = - γ³/6 - γ π²/12 - ζ(3)/3, which matches the standard. So the user's expansion is correct.\n\nSo how to derive this? The user tried splitting the integral into two parts. Let me see. The integral from 0 to 1, after expanding e^{-t} as a power series, becomes sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n!) ∫0^1 t^{n + z -1} dt = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! (z + n)). So Γ(z) = integral from 1 to infinity e^{-t} t^{z-1} dt + sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! (z + n)).\n\nThe sum term has a pole at z=0 from the n=0 term: 1/z. The other terms (n ≥ 1) are 1/(z + n) which can be expanded as 1/n - z/n² + z²/n³ - ... for |z| < n. Since we're expanding around z=0, this is valid. So sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! (z + n)) = (-1)^0/(0! z) + sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! (z + n)) = 1/z + sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^n/(n! n) (1 / (1 + z/n)) ].\n\nExpanding each 1/(1 + z/n) as a geometric series: 1 - z/n + z²/n² - ..., so each term becomes (-1)^n/(n! n) [1 - z/n + z²/n² - ...]. Therefore, the sum becomes sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! n) [1 - z/n + z²/n² - ...]. \n\nSo combining all terms, the sum is sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! n) - z sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! n²) + z² sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! n³) - ... \n\nTherefore, the entire expression for Γ(z) is:\n\nΓ(z) = integral from 1 to infinity e^{-t} t^{z-1} dt + 1/z + sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^{k+1} z^k sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! n^{k+1} }.\n\nBut the integral from 1 to infinity e^{-t} t^{z-1} dt can be expanded as a power series in z. Let me consider expanding t^{z-1} = e^{(z-1) ln t} = e^{- ln t} e^{z ln t} = (1/t) [1 + z ln t + z² (ln t)^2 / 2! + ...]. So the integral becomes integral from 1 to infinity e^{-t} (1/t) [1 + z ln t + z² (ln t)^2 / 2 + ...] dt. \n\nTherefore, the integral can be written as sum_{k=0}^\\infty [ integral from 1 to infinity e^{-t} (ln t)^k / (t k!) dt ] z^k.\n\nSo combining both parts, the gamma function is:\n\nΓ(z) = 1/z + sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! n) - sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n! n^{k+1}) ] (-1)^{k} z^k + sum_{k=0}^\\infty [ integral from 1 to infinity e^{-t} (ln t)^k / (t k!) dt ] z^k.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe these integrals and sums relate to known constants like γ, ζ(3), etc. The Euler-Mascheroni constant γ is defined as γ = lim_{n→∞} (H_n - ln n), and also appears in the expansion of Γ(z) around z=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the product representation. Let's consider the Weierstrass formula:\n\nΓ(z) = e^{-γ z} / z product_{n=1}^\\infty (1 + z/n)^{-1} e^{z/n}.\n\nTaking the logarithm, ln Γ(z) = -γ z - ln z + sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ -ln(1 + z/n) + z/n ].\n\nExpanding the logarithm: ln(1 + z/n) = z/n - z²/(2n²) + z³/(3n³) - ..., so -ln(1 + z/n) + z/n = z²/(2n²) - z³/(3n³) + ... Therefore,\n\nln Γ(z) = -γ z - ln z + sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ z²/(2n²) - z³/(3n³) + ... ].\n\nExponentiating this would give the Laurent expansion. But exponentiating a series is non-trivial. Let me denote S(z) = -γ z - ln z + sum_{k=2}^\\infty (-1)^k ζ(k-1) z^k /k, where ζ is the Riemann zeta function. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nsum_{n=1}^\\infty [ z²/(2n²) - z³/(3n³) + ... ] = z²/2 sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n² - z³/3 sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n³ + ... = z²/2 ζ(2) - z³/3 ζ(3) + z^4/4 ζ(4) - ...\n\nSo,\n\nln Γ(z) = -γ z - ln z + (ζ(2)/2) z² - (ζ(3)/3) z³ + (ζ(4)/4) z^4 - ... \n\nNow, to exponentiate this. Let me write ln Γ(z) = -ln z - γ z + S(z), where S(z) = (ζ(2)/2) z² - (ζ(3)/3) z³ + ... \n\nThen Γ(z) = (e^{-γ z + S(z)}) / z.\n\nExpanding e^{-γ z + S(z)} as a power series:\n\ne^{-γ z} e^{S(z)} = [1 - γ z + (γ² z²)/2 - (γ³ z³)/6 + ... ] [1 + S(z) + S(z)^2 /2 + S(z)^3 /6 + ... ].\n\nMultiplying these out:\n\nFirst, compute S(z):\n\nS(z) = (ζ(2)/2) z² - (ζ(3)/3) z³ + ... So up to z^3 terms:\n\nS(z) = (π²/12) z² - (ζ(3)/3) z³ + ...\n\nS(z)^2 = (π^4 / 144) z^4 + ... higher order terms.\n\nS(z)^3 and higher are negligible up to z^3.\n\nSo e^{S(z)} ≈ 1 + S(z) + S(z)^2 / 2 + ... ≈ 1 + (π²/12 z² - ζ(3)/3 z³) + (π^4 / 288 z^4) + ... \n\nSimilarly, e^{-γ z} ≈ 1 - γ z + γ² z² / 2 - γ³ z³ /6 + ...\n\nMultiplying these two:\n\n[1 - γ z + γ² z² /2 - γ³ z³ /6] [1 + π²/12 z² - ζ(3)/3 z³] =\n\n1*(1) + 1*(π²/12 z²) + 1*(- ζ(3)/3 z³) + (-γ z)(1) + (-γ z)(π²/12 z²) + (γ² z² /2)(1) + (-γ³ z³ /6)(1) + ... \n\nCombine terms:\n\n1 + (-γ z) + (γ² z² /2 + π² z² /12) + (- γ³ z³ /6 - γ π² z³ /12 - ζ(3) z³ /3) + ... \n\nTherefore, e^{-γ z + S(z)} ≈ 1 - γ z + (γ²/2 + π²/12) z² + (- γ³/6 - γ π² /12 - ζ(3)/3 ) z³ + ...\n\nThen Γ(z) = (1/z) [1 - γ z + (γ²/2 + π²/12) z² - (γ³/6 + γ π²/12 + ζ(3)/3 ) z³ + ... ] = 1/z - γ + (γ²/2 + π²/12) z - (γ³/6 + γ π²/12 + ζ(3)/3 ) z² + ... which matches the standard expansion. \n\nThe user's expansion has the coefficient for z as (γ² + π²/6)/2, which simplifies to γ²/2 + π²/12, matching. Similarly, the coefficient for z² is - [ γ³ + γ π²/2 + 2 ζ(3) ] /6 = -γ³/6 - γ π² /12 - ζ(3)/3, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the expansion can be obtained via the Weierstrass product formula by expanding the logarithm, exponentiating, and collecting terms. Alternatively, using the integral definitions and expanding each part as a series.\n\nThe user tried splitting the integral and expanding e^{-t}, but got terms with 1/z and sum over 1/(z +n). To connect this to the Laurent series, they need to expand each 1/(z +n) for n ≥1 as 1/n - z/n² + z²/n³ - ..., then combine all terms. The integral from 1 to infinity can be expanded as a series in z by expanding t^{z-1} = e^{(z-1)ln t} as a power series in z. Combining the two parts should yield the Laurent expansion. However, this might be more involved than using the product formula. \n\nTherefore, the problem is to derive the Laurent expansion of Γ(z) around z=0, which involves expanding the product representation or integral representation into a series, leading to the given coefficients involving γ, π²/6, and ζ(3).",
