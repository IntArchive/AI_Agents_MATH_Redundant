    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show that the image of a non-constant entire function is dense in the complex plane. They mentioned that it's a theorem in some books but are looking for an elementary proof. Alright, so first, let me recall some complex analysis concepts.\n\nAn entire function is a function that's holomorphic everywhere on the complex plane. Non-constant means it's not just a constant function. The goal is to prove that such a function's image is dense in ℂ. Density here means that for any complex number w and any ε > 0, there's some z such that |f(z) - w| < ε. So, no matter where you are in the complex plane, you can find points in the image of f arbitrarily close to that point.\n\nI remember that Picard's theorem states that an entire non-constant function takes on every complex value except possibly one. That's the Little Picard Theorem. But the user is asking for a proof of density, which is a weaker statement than Picard's. So maybe there's a more elementary approach than invoking Picard's theorem, which I think is proved using things like modular functions and might be more advanced.\n\nLet me think about other theorems. Liouville's theorem says bounded entire functions are constant. So if f is not constant, it can't be bounded. But unbounded doesn't immediately imply dense. For example, the exponential function is entire and not constant, its image is ℂ \\ {0}, which is dense in ℂ, but missing a point. Wait, but the exponential function is actually missing an entire point, 0. So in that case, the image isn't dense if we consider approaching 0, but actually, 0 is a limit point of the image because e^z approaches 0 as Re(z) → -∞. Wait, no, e^z never takes the value 0, but gets arbitrarily close. So the image of e^z is ℂ \\ {0}, which is not dense in ℂ because you can't approximate 0 by values of e^z, but wait, actually, 0 is a limit point of the image because for any ε > 0, there exists z with |e^z| < ε. So even though 0 isn't in the image, the image is still dense in ℂ. Because for any w in ℂ and ε > 0, if w is not zero, you can get close to it, and if w is zero, you can get as close as you like. Wait, so maybe even if the image omits a point, as long as that point is a limit point of the image, the image is dense. Hmm, but in the case of e^z, the omitted point 0 is a limit point, so the image is dense. But according to Picard's theorem, the only way an entire function can omit two points is if it's constant. So for non-constant entire functions, they can omit at most one point, and that omitted point must be a limit point of the image. Therefore, the image is either the whole complex plane or the whole plane minus one point, which is still dense.\n\nBut the user is asking for a proof that the image is dense, not necessarily invoking Picard. Maybe using a more elementary approach. Let's think about using Liouville's theorem or the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem. Wait, Casorati-Weierstrass applies to essential singularities. But entire functions don't have singularities except possibly at infinity. So maybe considering the behavior at infinity.\n\nIf f is entire and non-constant, then it's either a polynomial or a transcendental entire function. If it's a polynomial of degree at least 1, then by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, it's surjective, hence dense. Wait, no. Polynomials of degree at least 1 are surjective onto ℂ, right? Because for any w, there exists z such that f(z) = w. So their image is all of ℂ, which is certainly dense. So the problem is more interesting for transcendental entire functions. For example, e^z is transcendental, and its image omits 0, but as discussed, 0 is a limit point, so the image is dense.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"non-constant entire function,\" which includes both polynomials and transcendental functions. So maybe the user's theorem is that any non-constant entire function has a dense image. But wait, polynomials of degree ≥1 are entire and their images are all of ℂ, which is dense. So for polynomials, it's trivial. The challenge is for transcendental entire functions.\n\nBut maybe the user wants a proof that works for all non-constant entire functions, regardless of being polynomial or transcendental. Let me think of an elementary approach. Suppose, for contradiction, that the image is not dense. Then there exists some w ∈ ℂ and ε > 0 such that the image of f doesn't intersect the open disk D(w, ε). That is, |f(z) - w| ≥ ε for all z ∈ ℂ. If that's the case, then 1/(f(z) - w) is entire and bounded by 1/ε. By Liouville's theorem, it's constant, which implies f(z) is constant, contradicting the assumption that f is non-constant. Therefore, the image must be dense.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So the proof would be: assume the image is not dense, then there exists a disk not intersected by the image, then take reciprocal to get a bounded entire function, hence constant, leading to a contradiction. That's very similar to the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using Liouville's theorem. Yes, that's a standard argument. So maybe that's the elementary proof the user is looking for. Let me check the steps again.\n\nAssume f is non-constant entire and its image is not dense. Then there exists w and ε > 0 such that |f(z) - w| ≥ ε for all z. Then g(z) = 1/(f(z) - w) is entire. Since |g(z)| ≤ 1/ε, g is bounded. By Liouville, g is constant, so f(z) is constant, contradiction. Therefore, image is dense. Yes, this works. So this is a simple proof using Liouville's theorem, which is elementary in complex analysis.\n\nBut wait, in the exponential function case, the image omits 0, but according to this argument, if you take w = 0 and some ε, then |e^z| ≥ ε for all z. But that's not true. For example, e^z can take values arbitrarily close to 0, so for any ε, there exists z with |e^z| < ε. Therefore, the assumption that the image omits D(w, ε) is not possible. Hence, the proof by contradiction holds. Wait, but in the case of e^z, the image omits 0, but 0 is a limit point. So the image is dense. So the argument is correct because assuming that the image is not dense would require that some disk is completely missed, but in reality, even if you miss a single point, you can't miss a whole disk. Hence, the only way the image is not dense is if the function is constant. Therefore, the proof works.\n\nSo the key idea is that missing a disk would allow you to invert and get a bounded entire function, hence constant. Therefore, the image must be dense. This seems to be the elementary proof the user is asking for. So the answer would structure the problem by listing the assumptions: f is entire, f is non-constant, and then the problem is to show the image is dense in ℂ. But wait, in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions like n is integer, n divisible by 7. In this problem, the assumptions are the properties of the function. Let me parse the original question.\n\nThe original question is: \"how to show image of a non constant entire function is dense in $\\mathbb{C}$? is there any smallest proof? I have seen this as a theorem in some books but I want some elementary proof.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are that f is entire and non-constant. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an entire function,\nf is non-constant.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the image of f is dense in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nYes, that's correct. The user didn't mention any other specific conditions, so those are the two assumptions. Each assumption is on a separate line, each addressing one property. Then the problem is to show the image is dense.",
