    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem given into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully to understand what's being asked.\n\nFirst, the user is talking about two parts, I and II, corresponding to p=5 and p=7. They have conjectured equalities for integrals I(n) and J(n) involving hypergeometric functions and arctangent. The task is to prove these equalities and find the formula for p=3.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the key is to extract the assumptions for each problem. The original problem mentions things like n being a real number less than 4^4 or 6^6, the definitions of I(n) and J(n) as integrals, the form of the conjectured equations, and the roots of certain polynomials (quintic and septic equations). Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nStarting with part I (p=5):\n\n- I(n) is defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of arctan of a certain 4F3 hypergeometric function multiplied by x.\n- The conjecture is that (12n/5^5) * I(n) equals a combination of terms involving arctan(1/α), log terms, pi, and a polynomial P(α), where α is the largest positive root of the quintic equation α^5 - α^4 + n/5^5 = 0.\n- The condition given is that n is a real number less than 4^4 (which is 256, but the problem states n < 4^4 for p=5? Wait, the original problem says \"provided real number n < 4^4\", but for p=5, maybe that's a typo? Wait, looking back: In the original, for p=5, the user wrote \"provided real number n <4^4\". But 4^4 is 256, but for p=5, the hypergeometric function is 4F3, and the integral I(n) is defined with n/(4^4)x. Wait, maybe the user meant that for p=5, the upper limit for n is 4^4, which is 256, and for p=7, it's 6^6. That seems inconsistent, but the problem states it as such.\n\nSimilarly, for part II (p=7):\n\n- J(n) is the integral from 0 to 1 of arctan of a 6F5 hypergeometric function with parameters involving 1/7 to 6/7, denominators 2/6 to 7/6, and argument n/(6^6)x.\n- The conjecture is that (60n/7^7) J(n) equals another combination with arctan(1/β), log terms, pi, and a polynomial P(β), where β is the largest positive root of β^7 - β^6 + n/7^7 = 0, and n is a real number less than 6^6 (which is 46656).\n\nSo, each problem (I and II) has its own set of assumptions. However, the user is asking two separate questions here, but the problem statement in the example only addressed one problem. Since the user provided an example with a single problem, but here there are two main parts (I and II) plus a question about p=3, I need to structure this appropriately. But the instructions say to \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying that each problem should be formatted separately. However, the user's original post includes both parts I and II. Given the example, perhaps each part is a separate problem. But the user might have intended to include both parts under one problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove both conjectured equalities and find the formula for p=3.\n\nBut according to the example, the format is Assumption and Problem. So, for each part (I and II), we need to list their respective assumptions and then state the problem. However, the original problem is presented as two parts (I and II) under one question. The user's \"Questions\" at the end are \"How do we prove the two conjectured equalities? What's the formula for p=3?\".\n\nBut the task is to format the problem into Assumption and Problem. The example had a single assumption and problem. Here, perhaps we need to split into two problems, each with their own assumptions, and then the third question about p=3.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is presented as two conjectures (for p=5 and p=7) and a request for p=3, maybe we need to structure each conjecture as a separate problem. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions and the problem. Here, the user is presenting two conjectures and a related question. However, the instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format\" where \"problem\" refers to the entire content. But given that the user's original post has two main parts (I and II) and a third question, perhaps the assumptions and problem should be split accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is the combination of both parts I and II, and the assumptions are all the conditions for both. However, since they are separate conjectures, perhaps they should be structured as separate problems. But the user might want them as two separate problems within one post. However, the example shows a single problem.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but given the example, perhaps the correct approach is to list all relevant assumptions for each part and then state the problem as proving each equality. Let me try.\n\nFirst, for part I (p=5):\n\nAssumptions for I(n):\n- I(n) is defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of arctangent of a hypergeometric function _4F_3 with parameters (1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5; 2/4, 3/4, 5/4; (n/(4^4))x) dx.\n- The real number n is less than 4^4.\n- α is the largest positive root of the quintic equation α^5 - α^4 + n/5^5 = 0.\n- P(α) is the polynomial (1 - α)^3(5 + 3α).\n\nProblem: Prove that (12n/5^5) I(n) equals -12(1 - n/5^5) arctan(1/α) + 6 ln(2/(1+α^2)) + 3π + P(α).\n\nSimilarly, for part II (p=7):\n\nAssumptions for J(n):\n- J(n) is defined as the integral from 0 to 1 of arctangent of a hypergeometric function _6F_5 with parameters (1/7, 2/7, 3/7, 4/7, 5/7, 6/7; 2/6, 3/6, 4/6, 5/6, 7/6; (n/(6^6))x) dx.\n- The real number n is less than 6^6.\n- β is the largest positive root of the septic equation β^7 - β^6 + n/7^7 = 0.\n- P(β) is the polynomial (1 - β)^2(27 - 6β - 9β^2 + 8β^3 + 10β^4).\n\nProblem: Prove that (60n/7^7) J(n) equals 60(1 + n/7^7) arctan(1/β) - 30 ln(2/(1+β^2)) - 15π - P(β).\n\nAdditionally, the third question is about the formula for p=3, which is to find the analogous formula for p=3, but since there's no integral provided for p=3, it's more of a separate question. However, the original problem mentions \"What's the formula for p=3?\" as part of the questions.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem was formatted into Assumption and Problem. The original user here has two main conjectures (for p=5 and p=7) and a third question. However, the instructions say to structure the problem into assumptions and problem. Since the user's post includes multiple questions, but the example had a single problem, perhaps the correct approach is to structure each part as separate problems. But the user hasn't specified whether they want each part as a separate problem or combined. Given the example, maybe each conjecture is a separate problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the user wrote \"Questions: How do we prove the two conjectured equalities? What's the formula for p=3?\", maybe the problem is to address all three, but the assumptions are for each conjecture.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I should split them into two problems (for p=5 and p=7) and note the third question as part of the problem statement. But the format requires Assumption and Problem. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFor part I (p=5):\n\nAssumption:\n- $I(n) = \\int_0^1 \\arctan\\left[{}_4F_3\\left(\\frac{1}{5},\\frac{2}{5},\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{4}{5}; \\frac{2}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{5}{4}; \\frac{n}{4^4}x\\right)\\right] dx$,\n- $n$ is a real number,\n- $n < 4^4$,\n- $\\alpha$ is the largest positive root of $\\alpha^5 - \\alpha^4 + \\frac{n}{5^5} = 0$,\n- $P(\\alpha) = (1 - \\alpha)^3(5 + 3\\alpha)$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{12n}{5^5} I(n) = -12\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{5^5}\\right)\\arctan\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + 6\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\alpha^2}\\right) + 3\\pi + P(\\alpha).$$\n\nFor part II (p=7):\n\nAssumption:\n- $J(n) = \\int_0^1 \\arctan\\left[{}_6F_5\\left(\\frac{1}{7},\\frac{2}{7},\\frac{3}{7},\\frac{4}{7},\\frac{5}{7},\\frac{6}{7}; \\frac{2}{6},\\frac{3}{6},\\frac{4}{6},\\frac{5}{6},\\frac{7}{6}; \\frac{n}{6^6}x\\right)\\right] dx$,\n- $n$ is a real number,\n- $n < 6^6$,\n- $\\beta$ is the largest positive root of $\\beta^7 - \\beta^6 + \\frac{n}{7^7} = 0$,\n- $P(\\beta) = (1 - \\beta)^2(27 - 6\\beta - 9\\beta^2 + 8\\beta^3 + 10\\beta^4)$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{60n}{7^7} J(n) = 60\\left(1 + \\frac{n}{7^7}\\right)\\arctan\\frac{1}{\\beta} - 30\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\beta^2}\\right) - 15\\pi - P(\\beta).$$\n\nThe third question is about finding the formula for p=3, but since there's no specific integral or conjecture provided for p=3, it's an additional problem. However, the original problem mentions that \"Mathematica takes too long to evaluate the integral that I couldn't use an integer relations subroutine on it,\" suggesting that the integral for p=3 is similar but the user couldn't compute it. So the problem includes:\n\nProblem: What is the formula for $p=3$ analogous to the cases $p=5$ and $p=7$?\n\nBut according to the format, we need to list assumptions and the problem. Since there's no given integral or form for p=3, maybe it's outside the current assumptions and is a separate problem. However, since the user includes it as part of their questions, perhaps it should be mentioned as a third problem with whatever assumptions can be inferred.\n\nBut given the original problem's structure, the main focus is on parts I and II. The p=3 question is a follow-up. Given the example provided by the user, where only one problem was formatted, perhaps the answer should include both parts I and II each as separate problems with their own assumptions, and the third question as an additional problem without assumptions (since none are provided). However, the user might expect all parts to be included.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire problem is presented as two conjectures to prove and a third question to answer, so the formatted problem would have all the assumptions for both I and II and the problem statement would include proving both and finding p=3. But the example separated the problem into assumptions and a single problem. Since the user's example only had one problem, maybe the answer should format each part separately.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the entire original post is one question, so we should structure it as one problem, with all the necessary assumptions and the problem statement including both parts and the third question.\n\nHowever, looking at the example, the original problem had a single statement, and the formatted version had assumptions and problem. Here, the original question has two parts (I and II) and a third question. So perhaps the correct approach is to list all assumptions related to both parts and then state the problem as proving the two equalities and finding the formula for p=3.\n\nBut the assumptions for each part are different. For instance, in part I, the integral is I(n) with p=5, while in part II it's J(n) with p=7. Therefore, the assumptions are distinct for each part. Therefore, it's better to split them into two separate problems and then mention the third question.\n\nHowever, the user's example had a single problem. The assistant's task is to structure the given problem into the specified format. Therefore, perhaps the answer should present two separate formatted problems for parts I and II, each with their own assumptions and problem statements, and then a third problem for p=3 with whatever minimal assumptions can be inferred.\n\nBut given that the user's original post is one question encompassing all three parts, perhaps we need to combine the assumptions and problems. However, this would complicate the structure. Alternatively, perhaps list all the assumptions for both parts and then state the problem as proving both conjectures and finding the formula for p=3.\n\nAlternatively, given that the example had assumptions and problem, perhaps the answer should have three sections: two for parts I and II each, and one for p=3. But the user's format example only includes one assumption and one problem. This is a bit ambiguous, but following the example's structure, perhaps each conjecture is a separate problem.\n\nGiven the user's example, the key is to extract assumptions and the problem. For each of the two main conjectures (I and II), list the assumptions and problem. Then, the third question can be a separate problem with possible assumptions if any.\n\nBut the p=3 part doesn't have any given integral or form, just a request for the formula. So perhaps:\n\nProblem III: What is the formula analogous to those for $p=5$ and $p=7$ for the case $p=3$?\n\nAssumptions: Not provided, but perhaps inferred that it's similar, involving an integral of arctan of a hypergeometric function with parameters based on 1/3, 2/3, etc., and a root of a certain polynomial. But since the user doesn't specify, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, so the problem is open-ended.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the task is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem. The original problem includes all the details for parts I and II, so focusing on those.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best way is to present two separate formatted problems for parts I and II, each with their own assumptions and problem statements, and then mention the third question as part of the problem.\n\nBut the user's example didn't have multiple problems. Given that, perhaps the entire problem is considered as one, with multiple parts. Therefore, the assumptions would include all conditions for both I and II, and the problem would be to prove both conjectures and find p=3 formula. However, this might not fit the example's structure.\n\nAlternatively, given the complexity, perhaps the answer should be structured as follows, combining both parts into one problem, listing all assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- For $p=5$: $I(n) = \\int_0^1 \\arctan\\left[{}_4F_3\\left(\\frac{1}{5},\\frac{2}{5},\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{4}{5}; \\frac{2}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{5}{4}; \\frac{n}{4^4}x\\right)\\right] dx$ where $n$ is a real number $<4^4$, and $\\alpha$ is the largest root of $\\alpha^5 - \\alpha^4 + \\frac{n}{5^5}=0$, $P(\\alpha)=(1-\\alpha)^3(5+3\\alpha)$.\n- For $p=7$: $J(n) = \\int_0^1 \\arctan\\left[{}_6F_5\\left(\\frac{1}{7},\\frac{2}{7},\\frac{3}{7},\\frac{4}{7},\\frac{5}{7},\\frac{6}{7}; \\frac{2}{6},\\frac{3}{6},\\frac{4}{6},\\frac{5}{6},\\frac{7}{6}; \\frac{n}{6^6}x\\right)\\right] dx$ where $n$ is a real number $<6^6$, and $\\beta$ is the largest root of $\\beta^7 - \\beta^6 + \\frac{n}{7^7}=0$, $P(\\beta)=(1-\\beta)^2(27-6\\beta-9\\beta^2+8\\beta^3+10\\beta^4)$.\n\nProblem:\n1. Prove that for $p=5$, $$\\frac{12n}{5^5} I(n) = -12\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{5^5}\\right)\\arctan\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + 6\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\alpha^2}\\right) + 3\\pi + P(\\alpha).$$\n2. Prove that for $p=7$, $$\\frac{60n}{7^7} J(n) = 60\\left(1 + \\frac{n}{7^7}\\right)\\arctan\\frac{1}{\\beta} - 30\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\beta^2}\\right) - 15\\pi - P(\\beta).$$\n3. What is the analogous formula for $p=3$?\n\nBut the example had each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property. So for part I:\n\nAssumption:\n$I(n) = \\int_0^1 \\arctan\\left[{}_4F_3\\left(\\frac{1}{5},\\frac{2}{5},\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{4}{5}; \\frac{2}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{5}{4}; \\frac{n}{4^4}x\\right)\\right] dx$,\n$n$ is a real number,\n$n < 4^4$,\n$\\alpha$ is the largest positive root of $\\alpha^5 - \\alpha^4 + \\frac{n}{5^5} = 0$,\n$P(\\alpha) = (1 - \\alpha)^3(5 + 3\\alpha)$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{12n}{5^5} I(n) = -12\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{5^5}\\right)\\arctan\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + 6\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\alpha^2}\\right) + 3\\pi + P(\\alpha).$$\n\nSimilarly for part II:\n\nAssumption:\n$J(n) = \\int_0^1 \\arctan\\left[{}_6F_5\\left(\\frac{1}{7},\\frac{2}{7},\\frac{3}{7},\\frac{4}{7},\\frac{5}{7},\\frac{6}{7}; \\frac{2}{6},\\frac{3}{6},\\frac{4}{6},\\frac{5}{6},\\frac{7}{6}; \\frac{n}{6^6}x\\right)\\right] dx$,\n$n$ is a real number,\n$n < 6^6$,\n$\\beta$ is the largest positive root of $\\beta^7 - \\beta^6 + \\frac{n}{7^7} = 0$,\n$P(\\beta) = (1 - \\beta)^2(27 - 6\\beta - 9\\beta^2 + 8\\beta^3 + 10\\beta^4)$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{60n}{7^7} J(n) = 60\\left(1 + \\frac{n}{7^7}\\right)\\arctan\\frac{1}{\\beta} - 30\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\beta^2}\\right) - 15\\pi - P(\\beta).$$\n\nAnd then the third question as a separate problem, but since there's no information, perhaps:\n\nProblem: What is the formula for $p=3$ analogous to the cases $p=5$ and $p=7$?\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, they want the problem structured into the format with Assumption and Problem. Given that, the correct approach is to present each part (I and II) as separate problems with their own assumptions and problem statements, and then the third question as a separate problem. However, the user's original post is one question with three parts. But the example only had one problem. Given the ambiguity, I think the best way is to structure each conjecture as a separate problem, following the example's structure, and then mention the third question as part of the problem statement.\n\nBut the user might expect all three parts to be included in one problem. However, since the example separates them, and the instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format\", referring to each individual problem, perhaps each main conjecture is a separate problem. Therefore, the final answer will have two formatted problems for parts I and II, and the third question as a separate problem without assumptions.",
