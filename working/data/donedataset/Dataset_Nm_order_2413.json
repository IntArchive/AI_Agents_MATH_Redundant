I tried googling this, but I don't think I understood the solution. How does one define an order on rational functions of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(x)=p(x)/q(x)$ ? How do you show that $\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ is non-archimedean? That there is no natural number $n$ , such that $n>\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ ? Do I substitute numerical values of $x$ and show that $\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ is unbounded or something?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the following order: let $f(x)=p(x)/q(x)$ be a rational function with \\begin{aligned}p(x)=a\\cdot x^n &+ \\text{ terms of degree less than $n$}\\\\\nq(x)=b\\cdot x^m &+ \\text{ terms of degree less than $m$}\\end{aligned} where of course $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Our order says that $f > 0$ if and only if $\\frac{a}{b} >0$. Notice this defines the order throughout the field; if one wishes to determine whether $f_1 > f_2$, write the difference $f_1-f_2$ as a single rational function and determine whether it is $>0$, $=0$ or $<0$. Now, this totally ordered field is not Archimedean. Indeed, consider the rational functions $f(x)=x$ and $g(x) = 1$. No matter how large you choose $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $f(x)>n\\cdot g(x)$, because $\\big(f-n\\cdot g\\big)(x)=x-n$ and the leading coefficient of $\\big(f-n\\cdot g\\big)$ is $1$, which is positive.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to know how to define an order on rational functions with rational coefficients (which form the field ℚ(x)) and then show that this ordered field is non-archimedean. They also mentioned that there should be no natural number n such that n > ℚ(x), which relates to the non-archimedean property. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what an ordered field is. An ordered field is a field with a total order that is compatible with the field operations. So, for ℚ(x) to be an ordered field, we need to define an ordering ≤ such that for any rational functions f, g, h ∈ ℚ(x):\n\n1. If f ≤ g and g ≤ h, then f ≤ h (transitivity).\n2. Exactly one of f < g, f = g, or f > g holds (trichotomy).\n3. If f ≤ g, then f + h ≤ g + h (translation invariance).\n4. If f ≥ 0 and g ≥ 0, then fg ≥ 0 (closure under multiplication).\n\nNow, how do we define such an order on rational functions? The key idea I remember is to use the concept of \"behavior at infinity.\" For rational functions, we can compare them based on their leading terms as x approaches infinity. For example, if we have two polynomials p(x) and q(x), the rational function p(x)/q(x) will dominate based on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. If the degree of p is higher than q, the function tends to infinity as x grows; if the degrees are equal, we compare the leading coefficients; if the degree of p is lower, it tends to zero. This seems like a way to define an order.\n\nSo, to define the order formally, for a rational function f(x) = p(x)/q(x) where p and q are polynomials with coefficients in ℚ and q ≠ 0, we can look at the leading coefficients and degrees. Let’s denote the leading term of p(x) as a_n x^n and of q(x) as b_m x^m. Then, the leading term of f(x) is (a_n / b_m) x^{n - m}. \n\nThe order can then be defined as follows: f > 0 if and only if the leading coefficient a_n / b_m is positive. Then, for two rational functions f and g, we say f > g if f - g > 0. This should satisfy the properties of an ordered field.\n\nNow, the next part is showing that ℚ(x) is non-archimedean. An ordered field is archimedean if for every element, there exists a natural number n such that n > |f|. Conversely, it's non-archimedean if there exists an element f such that |f| > n for all natural numbers n. In other words, there is an element that is larger than every natural number.\n\nIn the context of rational functions, consider the function f(x) = x. Let's see what the order says about x. The leading term of x is 1 x^1, so x > 0 because the leading coefficient is positive. Now, compare x with any natural number n. The function n is a constant function, say n = n/1, with leading term n x^0. The difference x - n has leading term 1 x^1, which is positive. Therefore, x > n for any natural number n. Hence, x is an element that is larger than all natural numbers, proving that ℚ(x) is non-archimedean.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, they mentioned \"there is no natural number n such that n > ℚ(x)\". Hmm, maybe that's a misstatement. The correct non-archimedean property is that there exists an element (like x) such that no natural number n satisfies n > x. In other words, x is larger than all natural numbers n. So, in the ordered field ℚ(x), the element x is infinitely large compared to the natural numbers embedded in the field (as constant functions).\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem according to the required format, we need to list the assumptions. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The field in question is the set of rational functions with rational coefficients, denoted ℚ(x).\n2. The order on ℚ(x) is defined based on the leading coefficients and degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials.\n3. The natural numbers are embedded into ℚ(x) as constant functions.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the assumptions listed were specific conditions applied to the objects in the problem. In this case, the problem is more about defining the order and showing the non-archimedean property, so the assumptions might include the structure of the rational functions and the definition of the order.\n\nBut the original question doesn't state any specific conditions; it's asking how to define the order and show the non-archimedean nature. Therefore, when structuring the problem according to the given format, the assumptions would be the properties that ℚ(x) is a field of rational functions with rational coefficients, and that the order is defined in a specific way. However, since the problem is asking to define the order, perhaps the assumptions are about the setup, not additional conditions.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the user is asking to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user's original question is about how to define the order and show non-archimedean. So the assumptions here would be the setup needed for the problem. For instance:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The set of rational functions with rational coefficients, ℚ(x), is considered.\n- An order is defined on ℚ(x) based on the behavior of functions as x approaches infinity.\n- Natural numbers are identified with constant functions in ℚ(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℚ(x) forms an ordered field under the defined order and that it is non-archimedean by showing there exists no natural number n such that n > x.\n\nBut perhaps the exact assumptions need to be more precise. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe user's question is: How does one define an order on rational functions of the form ℚ(x)=p(x)/q(x)? How do you show that ℚ(x) is non-archimedean? That there is no natural number n, such that n>ℚ(x)?\n\nSo the problem is to define an order on ℚ(x) and show it's non-archimedean. The assumptions would include that ℚ(x) is the field of rational functions over ℚ, and perhaps the properties required for an ordered field. But since the problem is to define the order and prove the properties, maybe the assumptions are more about the structure given.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were specific conditions on the variables (n is an integer, n divisible by 7). Here, perhaps the assumptions are more about the definitions. However, the user's format requires each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- ℚ(x) is the field of rational functions with rational coefficients.\n- The order on ℚ(x) is defined by comparing the leading terms of the numerator and denominator polynomials.\n- Natural numbers are embedded into ℚ(x) as constant functions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℚ(x) is an ordered field under the defined order and that it is non-archimedean, i.e., there exists no natural number n such that n > x.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumption here is the definition of the order. Let me think. To define the order, we need to specify how two rational functions compare. The standard way is to say that a rational function f is positive if, when written in lowest terms f = p(x)/q(x), the leading coefficients of p and q have the same sign. Alternatively, since the coefficients are in ℚ, we can define f > 0 if the leading coefficient of f (i.e., the coefficient of the highest power in the numerator divided by that in the denominator) is positive.\n\nBut maybe more precisely, the order is defined such that for f ∈ ℚ(x), f > 0 if there exists an interval (a, ∞) such that f(x) > 0 for all sufficiently large x. This is equivalent to looking at the behavior as x approaches infinity. This definition then allows us to compare any two functions by looking at their difference.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include how the order is defined. However, since the problem is to define the order, perhaps the assumptions are the initial conditions necessary to pose the problem. Wait, the user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The original question is:\n\n\"How does one define an order on rational functions of the form ℚ(x)=p(x)/q(x)? How do you show that ℚ(x) is non-archimedean? That there is no natural number n, such that n>ℚ(x)?\"\n\nSo the problem is to:\n\n1. Define an order on ℚ(x).\n2. Show that with this order, ℚ(x) is an ordered field.\n3. Show that this ordered field is non-archimedean (i.e., there exists an element f in ℚ(x) such that for all natural numbers n, n < f).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- ℚ(x) is the field of rational functions over ℚ.\n- The order is defined based on the leading coefficients as x approaches infinity.\n- Natural numbers are considered as constant functions in ℚ(x).\n\nBut the exact phrasing needs to be concise and one condition per line. The problem statement would then be to prove that ℚ(x) is an ordered field under the defined order and that it's non-archimedean.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as structured is:\n\nAssumption:\n- The field ℚ(x) consists of rational functions with rational coefficients.\n- An order on ℚ(x) is defined by f > 0 if the leading coefficient of f is positive.\n- Natural numbers are identified with their images in ℚ(x) under the natural embedding.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℚ(x) is an ordered field and that it is non-archimedean by showing there is no natural number n such that n > x.\n\nBut to match the example, which had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), here the assumptions would need to specify the setup. Since the original problem is to define the order and show the properties, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- ℚ(x) is the field of rational functions with coefficients in ℚ.\n- The order on ℚ(x) is determined by the behavior of functions as x approaches infinity.\n- The natural numbers are elements of ℚ(x) as constant functions.\n\nProblem:\nDefine an order on ℚ(x) and prove that ℚ(x) is a non-archimedean ordered field.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to structure the problem as per the example, which lists the problem statement and the assumptions. The user's original example included the problem statement with the specific mathematical expression and the assumptions as conditions on n.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem found on Math Stack Exchange. The problem there is:\n\nTitle: Proof that rational functions are an ordered field, but non-archimedean - Bartle's elements of real analysis\n\nQuestion: I read that the set of rational functions with rational coefficients forms an ordered field, yet it is non-archimedean. I tried googling this, but I don't think I understood the solution. How does one define an order on rational functions of the form ℚ(x)=p(x)/q(x)? How do you show that ℚ(x) is non-archimedean? That there is no natural number n, such that n>ℚ(x)? Do I substitute numerical values of x and show that ℚ(x) is unbounded or something?\n\nSo, the problem is: Given that ℚ(x) is the set of rational functions with rational coefficients, define an order on it and show that it's a non-archimedean ordered field.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- ℚ(x) is the set of rational functions with rational coefficients.\n- An order is defined on ℚ(x) such that it becomes an ordered field.\n- The natural numbers are embedded into ℚ(x) as constant functions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℚ(x) is an ordered field under the defined order and that it is non-archimedean, i.e., there exists no natural number n such that n > x.\n\nBut the exact assumptions need to be more precise. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Each is a single condition on one object.\n\nIn this case, the original problem is to define the order and show the properties. Therefore, the assumptions are about the structure of the field and the order. But since the problem is to define the order, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The elements of ℚ(x) are rational functions p(x)/q(x) with p(x), q(x) ∈ ℚ[x] and q(x) ≠ 0.\n- The order on ℚ(x) is defined by comparing the leading terms of the numerator and denominator.\n- Natural numbers are considered as constant functions in ℚ(x).\n\nThen the problem is to show that under this order, ℚ(x) is an ordered field and non-archimedean.\n\nAlternatively, since the order is part of what needs to be defined, maybe the assumptions are just the setup, and the problem is to define the order and prove the properties. But according to the example, the assumptions are conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem had an expression A(n) and the user had to list assumptions about n. Here, the problem is more about the structure of the field and the order. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- ℚ(x) is the field of rational functions with coefficients in ℚ.\n- An order on ℚ(x) is defined such that f > 0 if the leading coefficient of f is positive.\n- Natural numbers n are elements of ℚ(x) as constant functions n/1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℚ(x) with the defined order is an ordered field and is non-archimedean, i.e., there is no natural number n such that n > x.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem doesn't specify the exact definition of the order; it's part of the problem to define it. So the assumptions are the initial conditions, and the problem is to define the order and show the properties. However, the format requires listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- ℚ(x) is the set of rational functions over ℚ.\n- The order on ℚ(x) is defined by f > g if there exists a real number M such that f(x) > g(x) for all x > M.\n- Natural numbers are embedded into ℚ(x) as constant functions.\n\nBut this might be assuming the order is defined via eventual comparison, which is one way to do it. Alternatively, the order is defined by considering the leading coefficients. Either way, the key is to specify the order in the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as posed in the original question is asking HOW to define the order and then show it's non-archimedean. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- ℚ(x) is the field of rational functions with rational coefficients.\n- An order on ℚ(x) must satisfy the axioms of an ordered field.\n- Natural numbers are elements of ℚ(x) via the natural inclusion.\n\nProblem:\nDefine an order on ℚ(x) and prove that ℚ(x) is a non-archimedean ordered field.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are specific conditions (like n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, since the problem is to define the order, the assumptions might be the basic setup, and the problem is the task.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to list the components that are given in the problem. Since the user states: \"the set of rational functions with rational coefficients forms an ordered field, yet it is non-archimedean.\" So the problem is to prove this statement. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The set of rational functions with rational coefficients, ℚ(x), is considered.\n- The order on ℚ(x) is defined such that it makes ℚ(x) an ordered field.\n- The natural numbers are embedded into ℚ(x) as constant functions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℚ(x) is an ordered field and that it is non-archimedean.\n\nHowever, the key is that the order is defined in a specific way, which is part of the problem. Therefore, to format it, the assumptions would need to include the necessary conditions for the order. But since the problem is to define the order, perhaps the assumptions are about the structure of ℚ(x), and the problem is to define the order and show the properties.\n\nGiven the user's example, where the original problem had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), and the formatted problem listed those, in this case, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- ℚ(x) is the field of rational functions with coefficients in ℚ.\n- An order on ℚ(x) is defined by comparing the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator.\n- Natural numbers are considered as elements of ℚ(x) via the natural embedding.\n\nBut since the problem is to define the order, maybe the first assumption is just that ℚ(x) is the field of rational functions, and the rest are part of the problem. However, the example's format includes assumptions as given conditions. Since the problem here is to define the order and prove the properties, the assumptions might be:\n\n- The field ℚ(x) consists of rational functions p(x)/q(x) with p(x), q(x) ∈ ℚ[x] and q(x) ≠ 0.\n- The order on ℚ(x) is defined such that f > 0 if the leading coefficient of f is positive.\n- Natural numbers n are identified with the constant functions n/1 in ℚ(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℚ(x) is an ordered field under the defined order and that it is non-archimedean.\n\nAlternatively, since the order is part of what needs to be defined, perhaps the problem statement includes defining the order. The user's original question is asking \"How does one define an order...\" So the problem is to define the order and show the properties. Thus, the formatted problem might have:\n\nAssumption:\n- ℚ(x) is the field of rational functions over ℚ.\n- The order on ℚ(x) is determined by the behavior of functions as x approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nDefine an order on ℚ(x) and prove that it forms a non-archimedean ordered field.\n\nBut the example provided by the user has assumptions as specific conditions. Given that, perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- Each element of ℚ(x) is a rational function with rational coefficients.\n- The order on ℚ(x) is defined by comparing leading terms at infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℚ(x) is an ordered field and non-archimedean.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to show that the ordered field is non-archimedean given the order, then the assumptions would include the definition of the order. However, the exact way to phrase it according to the required format is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- The field ℚ(x) consists of rational functions p(x)/q(x) with p(x), q(x) ∈ ℚ[x] and q(x) ≠ 0.\n- The order on ℚ(x) is defined such that for f ∈ ℚ(x), f > 0 if the leading coefficient of f is positive.\n- Natural numbers are embedded into ℚ(x) as constant functions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℚ(x) is an ordered field and that there is no natural number n such that n > x.\n\nThis seems to fit the required format. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object (ℚ(x), the order, natural numbers). The problem is then to prove the two statements.\n\nYes, this should be the correct structure. The key points are:\n\n1. The elements of ℚ(x) are rational functions with rational coefficients.\n2. The specific definition of the order (based on leading coefficients).\n3.
