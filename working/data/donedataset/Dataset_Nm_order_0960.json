    "Content": "Comparison with $\\dfrac{1}{i^2}$ shows that the series $$\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty\\frac{\\sin\\left(x/i\\right)}{i}$$ is convergent. However, the function of $x$ thus obtained appears to be bounded, with the bound approaching zero in $k$ . I have no idea how to prove this, every method I know gives me no better a bound than the obvious $\\dfrac{\\pi^2x}{6}$ . My suspicion is that prior to reaching $\\left|\\dfrac{x}{i}\\right|<1$ , the values of $\\dfrac{x}{i}$ modulo $2\\pi$ have an asymptotic distribution which helps similar to other identities with alternating signs bounded by $\\dfrac{1}{i}$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is unbounded though to prove it, I need the fact that the sum of reciprocals of the primes $p=4k+1$ is infinite, which seems like a bit too heavy tool for this problem. The first observation is that for every $M,q,\\varphi$ , we have $$\n\\left|\\frac 1M\\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}\\sin(2\\pi mq+\\varphi) \\right|\\le\\min(1,\\tfrac1{M\\|q\\|})\n$$ where $\\|q\\|$ is the distance from $q$ to the nearest integer (just write $\\sin\\theta=\\Im e^{i\\theta}$ and sum the corresponding geometric progression). The second observation is that for $0\\le x\\le B$ , we have $$\n\\left|\\sum_{k\\ge B}\\frac{\\sin(x/k)}{k}\\right|\\le\\sum_{k\\ge B}\\frac B{k^2}\\le 2\\,.\n$$ Now enumerate the primes $p=4k+1$ as $p_1,p_2,\\dots$ and put $A=\\prod_{j=1}^N p_j$ . Consider $x_m=(4m+1)A\\frac\\pi 2$ , $m=0,\\dots,M-1$ . Denote the sum of the series by $S(x)$ . We want to look at the average $\n\\frac 1M\\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} S(x_m)\n$ .\nFirst of all, we can truncate the series in the definition of $S(x_m)$ to the first $B=2\\pi AM$ terms (the rest is uniformly bounded). Now if $k\\not\\mid A$ , then by our first observation the average of the corresponding term in the series is in absolute value at most $\\frac 1k\\frac 1{M\\|\\frac Ak\\|}$ . However, $\\|\\frac Ak\\|\\ge \\frac 1k$ for $k\\le 2A$ and equals $\\frac Ak$ for $k>2A$ . Thus, the sum of these averages is at most $$\n\\sum_{k\\le 2A}\\frac 1M+\\sum_{2A\\le k\\le B}\\frac 1{AM}\\le \\frac{2A}M+\\frac{2\\pi AM}{AM}\\le 2(1+\\pi)\\,,\n$$ provided that $M>A$ , say. Thus we are left with the terms for which $k\\mid A$ . However in this case $A/k\\equiv 1\\mod 4$ , so $\\sin(x_m/k)=1$ for all $m$ and all these terms push in the same direction (positive), which makes the corresponding sum at least $$\n\\sum_{k\\mid A}\\frac 1k\\ge\\sum_{j=1}^N \\frac 1{p_j}\\,,\n$$ which can be made arbitrarily large.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question. The user is asking about the boundedness of the series sum from i=k to infinity of sin(x/i)/i. They mention comparing it with 1/i² which shows convergence, but they want to know if the function of x is bounded, with the bound approaching zero as k increases.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The original problem states that the series is convergent, which is probably due to comparison with 1/i². But in the assumptions, we need to list each condition applied to one object. The problem is about proving boundedness of the resulting function in x, with the bound depending on k.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are specific and each line addresses one property. Here, the key elements are that the series starts at i=k, goes to infinity, each term is sin(x/i)/i, and x is a variable. The problem is to show that the sum is bounded as a function of x, with the bound approaching zero as k increases.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include that i starts at k and goes to infinity, the terms are sin(x/i)/i, and x is a real number (though not stated, maybe implied). However, the original question doesn't specify any restrictions on x, so maybe we don't need to assume anything about x except that it's a variable. The problem is about boundedness in x, so the main assumption is the structure of the series.\n\nWait, the example for the previous problem included assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is about the series for x and k. The original question doesn't state any specific conditions on x or k, other than k being the starting index. So perhaps the assumptions are just the form of the series, starting at i=k, and the terms being sin(x/i)/i. The problem is to prove that the series, as a function of x, is bounded with the bound approaching zero as k increases.\n\nSo putting that together:\n\nAssumption: The series is ∑_{i=k}^∞ sin(x/i)/i,\nProblem: Prove that the series is bounded as a function of x, with the bound approaching zero as k approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"the function of x thus obtained appears to be bounded, with the bound approaching zero in k\". So the bound depends on k and tends to zero as k increases. So the problem is to show that for each k, there's a bound M(k) such that |sum| ≤ M(k) for all x, and M(k) → 0 as k → ∞.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should capture that. The assumptions would be the structure of the series, and the problem is proving boundedness in x with the bound depending on k and approaching zero as k grows.\n\nI don't see any other assumptions in the original question. The user mentions comparing with 1/i² for convergence, but that's already established. The focus is on the boundedness. So the main assumption is the definition of the series. The problem is to prove the boundedness as described.",
