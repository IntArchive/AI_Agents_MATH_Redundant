    "Content": "Let a function $f(x)$ be algebraic if it satisfies an equation of the form $$c_n(x)(f(x))^n + c_{n-1}(x)(f(x))^{n-1} + \\cdots + c_0(x)=0,$$ for $c_k(x)$ rational functions of $x$, and let $f$ be called transcendental if it is not algebraic. Is it possible to use this definition directly to show that $e^x$ is transcendental? One way I have been considering for any complex number is this: Let $x_0\\in\\mathbb{C}$ and $x_n=x_0+2\\pi i n$, where $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Hence $x_n\\neq x_m$ for all $n\\neq m$, but we do have $e^{x_n}=e^{x_m}$ for all $n,m\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ (since $e^{2\\pi i n} = 1$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$). But since the Implicit Function Theorem suggests there exists an exact algebraic formula for $x$ using the above definition of an algebraic function, then $e^x$ can not be algebraic since there are an infinite number of representations $x_n$ of $x$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One could use the growth at infinity of the function $f:x\\mapsto\\mathrm e^x$ . Assume that $f$ is algebraic and choose a real number $x\\geqslant0$ . Then $|f(x)|\\geqslant1$ and $$\n|c_n(x)|\\,|f(x)|^n\\leqslant b(x)|f(x)|^{n-1},\\qquad b(x)=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n-1}|c_k(x)|.\n$$ Hence, for every real number $x\\geqslant0$ such that $c_n(x)\\ne0$ , $|f(x)|\\leqslant b(x)/|c_n(x)|$ . But indeed, $c_n(x)\\ne0$ for every real number $x$ large enough and $b(x)/|c_n(x)|$ can grow at most polynomially when the real number $x$ goes to $+\\infty$ while $|f(x)|=\\mathrm e^x$ grows... well, exponentially. This is a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants to show that e^x is a transcendental function using the given definitions. The original problem's title is asking for a proof that e^x is transcendental, so the main goal is clear.\n\nFirst, the user defines algebraic functions as those satisfying a polynomial equation with rational function coefficients. Then, they mention considering complex numbers x_n = x_0 + 2πi n, which are distinct but have the same exponential value. The argument seems to be that since there are infinitely many x_n mapping to the same e^{x_n}, but algebraic functions can't have infinitely many preimages for a single value (due to the implicit function theorem providing a finite number of solutions?), this would imply e^x is transcendental.\n\nBut the user is unsure and is asking if this approach works. The task is to structure their problem into the specified format. \n\nLooking at the example, the Assumptions section lists each condition on one object. So, in this case, the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. A function f(x) is algebraic if it satisfies a non-zero polynomial equation with rational function coefficients.\n2. The exponential function e^x is considered.\n3. The user defines x_n = x_0 + 2πi n for integer n, which are distinct but e^{x_n} is the same for all n.\n4. The Implicit Function Theorem suggests that an algebraic equation would have finitely many solutions x for a given f(x).\n\nThese are the key points. The problem is to determine if using the infinitely many preimages x_n under e^x can directly show e^x is transcendental. So the problem statement would be to prove that e^x is transcendental using this approach involving the x_n and the Implicit Function Theorem.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user is asking whether their approach is valid. However, the example given in the format seems to be for a problem statement to prove something, not to validate a method. Hmm. The user might need clarification, but according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the format. The original problem's title is \"Proof that e^x is a transcendental function...\", so the main problem is to prove e^x is transcendental using the given definition, possibly via the outlined method.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include the definitions provided, the properties of e^x having infinitely many x_n with the same value, and the implication from the Implicit Function Theorem. The problem is to prove e^x is transcendental using these.",
