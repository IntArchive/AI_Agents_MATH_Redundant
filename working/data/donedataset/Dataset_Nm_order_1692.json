    "Content": "Let $f:A\\times B\\to \\mathbb R$. Is it always true that\n$$\nf^* = \\sup\\limits_{a\\in A,b\\in B}f(a,b) = \\sup\\limits_{a\\in A}\\sup\\limits_{b\\in B}f(a,b).\n$$\nI proved it by the $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ arguments, but I still do not sure if I've done it formal enough. Proof: Let $g(a) = \\sup\\limits_{b\\in B}f(a,b)$ hence $g(a)\\geq f(a,b)$ for all $b\\in B$ and for any $\\varepsilon>0$ exists $b'_{a,\\varepsilon}\\in B$ such that $f(a,b'_{a,\\varepsilon})\\geq g(a)-\\varepsilon/2$. We put $g^* = \\sup\\limits_{a\\in A}g(a)$, then $g^*\\geq g(a)\\geq f(a,b)$ for all $a\\in A,b\\in A$ and for any $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists $a'_\\varepsilon\\in A$ such that $g(a'_\\varepsilon)\\geq g^*-\\varepsilon/2$. Now, for an arbitrary $\\varepsilon>0$ we can take $a'_\\varepsilon\\in A$ and $b'_{a',\\varepsilon}\\in B$ such that $f(a'_\\varepsilon,b'_{a',\\varepsilon})\\geq g(a'_\\varepsilon)-\\varepsilon/2\\geq g^*-\\varepsilon$, so $g^* = f^*$. For the case $f^* = \\infty$ I have almost the same proof (just inequalities are different). Should I also put it here?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes. Let $x = \\sup\\limits_{a \\in A, b \\in B}f(a,b)$ and $y = \\sup\\limits_{a \\in A}\\sup\\limits_{b\\in B}f(a,b)$, where we assume that both exist. For each $a\\in A$ let $y_a = \\sup\\limits_{b\\in B}f(a,b)$; clearly all $y_a$ exist, $y = \\sup\\limits_{a\\in A}y_a$, and of course $y_a \\le y$ for each $a \\in A$. Fix $a_0 \\in A$; $f(a,b) \\le x$ for all $\\langle a,b \\rangle \\in A \\times B$, so in particular $f(a_0,b) \\le x$ for all $b \\in B$, and hence $y_{a_0} = \\sup\\limits_{b\\in B}f(a_0,b) \\le x$. Thus, $y_a \\le x$ for all $a\\in A$, and it follows that $y = \\sup\\limits_{a\\in A} y_a \\le x$. Suppose that $y<x$, and fix $z \\in (y,x)$. By the definition of $x$ there is some $\\langle a,b \\rangle \\in A \\times B$ such that $f(a,b) > z$. But then we must have $y_a \\ge f(a,b) > z > y$, which is absurd. Hence $x=y$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if the double supremum of a function f over A×B is equal to the iterated suprema, first over B then over A. Hmm, I need to structure this according to the given format. \n\nFirst, listing the assumptions. The original question mentions a function f defined on A×B to the real numbers. The problem is about the equality of two suprema: the double supremum and the iterated one. So the assumptions would include the domain of f, the real-valued nature, and any conditions on A and B? Wait, the problem as stated doesn't specify any particular conditions on A and B, like non-emptiness or being subsets of some space. The example provided in the original question didn't add extra assumptions beyond the function's definition. So maybe the only assumptions are that f is a real-valued function on the Cartesian product of A and B. \n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the original problem. In this case, the original problem doesn't state any specific conditions on A, B, or f beyond f being defined on A×B to R. So the assumptions here should be:\n\n- A and B are sets.\n- f is a function from A×B to R.\n\nBut the problem as posed is whether the double supremum equals the iterated supremum. However, the user's proof uses epsilon-delta arguments and seems to handle the case where the suprema are finite and when f* is infinity. The problem statement in the original question is general: \"Is it always true that...\" So there are no hidden assumptions here. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the domain of f and that it's real-valued. The problem is to prove the equality of the two suprema. \n\nWait, the original question's title is \"Simple question: the double supremum\", and the user's proof uses epsilon arguments. The problem is to verify the equality. So the assumptions are just the function's definition. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so the assumption listed was n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, actually, in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example might have been a different problem. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example given by the user: Original problem states \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Unless there's a typo or misunderstanding. But in any case, following the user's example, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should list the basic setup: f is a function from A×B to R, A and B are sets. But in the original problem here, there are no additional constraints. The user's problem is whether the equality holds always. So the assumptions are just the existence of the function and its domain. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from A×B to ℝ,\nA is a set,\nB is a set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n$$\nf^* = \\sup\\limits_{a\\in A,b\\in B}f(a,b) = \\sup\\limits_{a\\in A}\\sup\\limits_{b\\in B}f(a,b).\n$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"Is it always true that...\" So the problem is to confirm the equality. The user also mentions handling the case when f* is infinity. So the problem is to show the equality holds in all cases, including when the suprema are infinite. Hence, the assumptions are that A and B are sets, and f is defined on their product to the reals. The problem is to prove the equality of the double supremum and the iterated suprema.",
