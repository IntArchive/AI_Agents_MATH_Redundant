    "Content": "The question is: Show that there are an infinite number of pairs $(m,n): m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, such that: $$\\frac{m+1}{n}+\\frac{n+1}{m} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$$ I started off approaching this problem by examining the fact that whenever the expression was a positive integer, the following must be true: $$\\frac{m+1}{n}+\\frac{n+1}{m} - \\left\\lfloor\\frac{m+1}{n}+\\frac{n+1}{m}\\right\\rfloor = 0$$ However, I was unable to do much more with this expression, so I abandoned it and started the problem again from a different angle. Next I re-arranged the expression to state that: $$\\frac{m^2+m+n^2+n}{mn} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+} \\implies \\frac{m(m+1) + n(n+1)}{mn} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$$ And therefore: $$mn \\mid (m(m+1) + n(n+1))$$ However, I'm unsure how to demonstrate there are infinitely many occurances of $(m, n)$ for which this is true. So I'd appreciate any help. Thanks in advance",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Define the Fibonacci sequence in the usual way: $F_0=0$, $F_1=1$, $F_{k+2}=F_{k+1}+F_k$ for $k\\ge0$. It is easy to prove by induction that for all indices $k$ we have\n$$\nF_{k+1}^2-F_{k+1}F_k-F_k^2=(-1)^k.\\tag{1}\n$$\nAssume that $k$ is odd. Substitute $F_{k+1}=F_{k+2}-F_k$ to equation $(1)$. After expanding it out and combining the terms we get\n$$\nF_{k+2}^2-3F_{k+2}F_k+F_k^2=-1.\\tag{2}\n$$\nLet us select $m=F_{k+2}+1$ and $n=F_k+1$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show there are infinitely many pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that (m+1)/n + (n+1)/m is a positive integer. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the expression. Let me rewrite it to make it clearer. Combining the two fractions, we get [m(m+1) + n(n+1)] / (mn). So the numerator is m(m+1) + n(n+1), and the denominator is mn. The problem states that this fraction must be an integer. Therefore, mn must divide m(m+1) + n(n+1). \n\nSo, mn | [m(m+1) + n(n+1)]. Let's denote the numerator as N = m(m+1) + n(n+1). The condition is that mn divides N. \n\nMy first thought is to look for patterns or specific cases where this might hold. Maybe setting m = n? Let's test that. If m = n, then N becomes m(m+1) + m(m+1) = 2m(m+1). The denominator is m^2. So we have 2m(m+1)/m^2 = 2(m+1)/m. For this to be an integer, m must divide 2(m+1). Simplifying, 2(m+1)/m = 2 + 2/m. So 2/m must be an integer. That implies m divides 2. Therefore, m can be 1 or 2. So when m = n = 1: (1+1)/1 + (1+1)/1 = 2 + 2 = 4, which is integer. When m = n = 2: (3)/2 + (3)/2 = 3, which is integer. But m = n = 3 would give 4/3 + 4/3 ≈ 2.666, not integer. So only m = 1 and 2 work here. That's finite, so m = n doesn't give us infinitely many solutions.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's consider fixing m and trying to solve for n, or vice versa. Suppose we fix m and see what n must satisfy. Let's take the equation:\n\n[m(m+1) + n(n+1)] / (mn) = k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nMultiply both sides by mn:\n\nm(m+1) + n(n+1) = kmn\n\nLet's rearrange terms:\n\nn(n+1) - kmn + m(m+1) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in n:\n\nn² + n - kmn + m² + m = 0\n\nn² + (1 - km)n + m² + m = 0\n\nFor this quadratic equation to have integer solutions for n, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:\n\nD = (1 - km)² - 4 * 1 * (m² + m)\n\nExpand D:\n\n= 1 - 2km + k²m² - 4m² - 4m\n\n= k²m² - (2k + 4)m² - 4m + 1\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look for parametric solutions. Maybe set m and n in terms of some parameter t, such that the divisibility condition holds. For example, suppose m = t, and n is some function of t. Let's try m = t and see if we can find n(t) such that the expression is integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set m = n + k for some fixed k, but that might not lead us anywhere.\n\nWait, let's think about the original expression:\n\n(m+1)/n + (n+1)/m is integer.\n\nLet me denote S = (m+1)/n + (n+1)/m. Then S must be a positive integer. Let's write S = a, where a is in Z+.\n\nSo:\n\n(m+1)/n + (n+1)/m = a\n\nMultiply both sides by mn:\n\nm(m+1) + n(n+1) = a mn\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So we need m and n such that m(m+1) + n(n+1) is divisible by mn.\n\nAnother angle: Let's rearrange the equation:\n\nm(m+1) + n(n+1) ≡ 0 mod mn\n\nWhich implies:\n\nm(m+1) ≡ -n(n+1) mod mn\n\nBut m and n may not be coprime, so maybe split into congruences modulo m and modulo n.\n\nUsing the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since m and n may not be coprime, but perhaps consider modulo m and modulo n separately.\n\nFirst, consider the equation modulo m:\n\nLeft side: m(m+1) ≡ 0 mod m\n\nRight side: -n(n+1) ≡ 0 mod m\n\nSo, from m(m+1) + n(n+1) ≡ 0 mod m, we get n(n+1) ≡ 0 mod m.\n\nSimilarly, modulo n:\n\nLeft side: m(m+1) ≡ 0 mod n\n\nRight side: -n(n+1) ≡ 0 mod n\n\nThus, m(m+1) ≡ 0 mod n.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\n1. n(n+1) ≡ 0 mod m\n\n2. m(m+1) ≡ 0 mod n\n\nSo, m divides n(n+1), and n divides m(m+1).\n\nSo, we need m | n(n+1) and n | m(m+1). Interesting. So each divides the product of the other and the other plus one.\n\nPerhaps if m and n are consecutive integers? Let's suppose m = n + 1. Then let's check the conditions.\n\nSet m = n + 1.\n\nFirst, m divides n(n+1). Since m = n + 1, m divides n(n+1). But n and n+1 are coprime, so m divides n+1. So n+1 divides n+1, which is true. So that condition holds.\n\nSecond, n divides m(m+1) = (n+1)(n+2). So n divides (n+1)(n+2). Since n and n+1 are coprime, n must divide n+2. So n divides (n+2) - n = 2. Therefore, n divides 2. Hence, n can be 1 or 2.\n\nTesting n=1, m=2:\n\n(2+1)/1 + (1+1)/2 = 3 + 1 = 4, integer. Good.\n\nn=2, m=3:\n\n(4)/2 + (3)/3 = 2 + 1 = 3, integer. Good.\n\nBut again, only finite solutions here. So consecutive integers don't yield infinitely many solutions.\n\nHmm, maybe if m and n are in some other relation. For example, set m = k(n) for some function k.\n\nAlternatively, let's try specific small values to see if we can spot a pattern.\n\nTake m=1:\n\nThen S = (1+1)/n + (n+1)/1 = 2/n + n + 1. For this to be integer, 2/n must be integer. So n divides 2. Hence n=1 or 2.\n\nn=1: S=2/1 + 2/1=4.\n\nn=2: S=2/2 + 3/1=1+3=4.\n\nSo two solutions here.\n\nm=2:\n\nS=3/n + (n+1)/2. Must be integer. Let's check n=1: 3/1 + 2/2=3+1=4. n=2: 3/2 + 3/2=3. n=3: 3/3 + 4/2=1 +2=3. n=4: 3/4 +5/2=0.75 +2.5=3.25, not integer. n=5: 3/5 +6/2=0.6+3=3.6, not integer. So n=1,2,3 work. So three solutions here.\n\nBut these are still finite. The problem wants infinitely many. So there must be a parametric family of solutions.\n\nLooking back at the initial approach, maybe suppose that m divides n+1 and n divides m+1. Let's see:\n\nIf m divides n+1, then n+1 = km for some integer k.\n\nSimilarly, if n divides m+1, then m+1 = ln for some integer l.\n\nSo we have:\n\nn = km -1\n\nm = ln -1\n\nSubstitute m from the second equation into the first:\n\nn = k(ln -1) -1 = kln -k -1\n\nBut from the second equation, m = ln -1, so substituting into the first, n = k(ln -1) -1.\n\nBut this seems a bit circular. Let's try to solve for n and m.\n\nFrom m divides n+1: n+1 = a m\n\nFrom n divides m+1: m+1 = b n\n\nSo we have:\n\nn = a m -1\n\nm = b n -1\n\nSubstitute the first into the second:\n\nm = b(a m -1) -1 = a b m - b -1\n\nRearrange:\n\nm - a b m = -b -1\n\nm(1 - a b) = - (b +1 )\n\nThus,\n\nm = (b +1 ) / (a b -1 )\n\nSimilarly, n can be expressed in terms of a and b. For m and n to be positive integers, the denominator a b -1 must divide b +1, and the result must be positive. So a b -1 must be a positive divisor of b +1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps choosing specific a and b such that a b -1 divides b +1.\n\nLet's try setting a =1. Then m = (b+1)/(1 * b -1) = (b+1)/(b-1). For this to be integer, b-1 must divide b+1. So (b+1)/(b-1) = 1 + 2/(b-1). So 2 must be divisible by b-1. Thus, b-1 can be 1 or 2, so b=2 or 3.\n\nIf b=2: m=(2+1)/(2-1)=3/1=3. Then from n = a m -1=1*3 -1=2. So m=3, n=2. Check: (3+1)/2 + (2+1)/3=4/2 +3/3=2+1=3. Good.\n\nIf b=3: m=(3+1)/(3-1)=4/2=2. Then n=1*2 -1=1. Check: (2+1)/1 + (1+1)/2=3 +1=4. Good.\n\nBut these are just specific solutions. If we set a=2, then m=(b+1)/(2b -1). We need 2b -1 divides b+1. Let's solve 2b -1 | b +1.\n\nLet k = 2b -1. Then b = (k +1)/2. Then b +1 = (k +1)/2 +1 = (k +3)/2. So k divides (k +3)/2. Therefore, k divides (k +3)/2. Since k divides (k +3)/2, then (k +3)/2 = mk for some integer m. So k +3 = 2mk. Rearranged, 2mk -k =3. k(2m -1)=3. Since k and m are positive integers, possible solutions:\n\nk=1, 2m -1=3 ⇒ m=2. Then b=(k+1)/2=(1+1)/2=1. So m=(b+1)/(2b -1)=(1+1)/(2*1 -1)=2/1=2. Then n=2*2 -1=3. Check: (2+1)/3 + (3+1)/2=3/3 +4/2=1 +2=3. Good.\n\nk=3, 2m -1=1 ⇒ m=1. Then b=(3+1)/2=2. m=(2+1)/(2*2 -1)=3/3=1. Then n=2*1 -1=1. Check: (1+1)/1 + (1+1)/1=2 +2=4. Good.\n\nSo with a=2, we get solutions (m,n)=(2,3) and (1,1). Again finite.\n\nThis approach isn't yielding infinitely many solutions. Maybe another way. Let's suppose that m and n are such that m = n +k for some k, but not necessarily consecutive.\n\nAlternatively, consider setting m = tn for some t >0. Then n = m/t, but since m and n must be integers, t must be a rational number. Maybe set t as a fraction p/q, but this might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, suppose m and n satisfy a recurrence relation. For example, suppose we can generate solutions from previous ones. But how?\n\nWait, let's look back at the problem statement. The user mentions that they started by writing the expression as floor function, but then switched to the divisibility condition. Maybe there's another angle. Let's consider that the expression (m+1)/n + (n+1)/m must be integer. Let's denote this as k.\n\nSo, (m+1)/n + (n+1)/m = k. Multiply both sides by mn:\n\nm(m+1) + n(n+1) = kmn.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nm² + m + n² + n = kmn.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nm² - kmn + n² + m + n =0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in variables m and n. Perhaps we can fix one variable and solve for the other.\n\nAlternatively, treat this as a quadratic in m:\n\nm² + ( -kn +1 )m + n² +n =0.\n\nFor this to have integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square:\n\nD = (-kn +1 )² -4*1*(n² +n )\n\n= k²n² - 2kn +1 -4n² -4n\n\n= (k² -4)n² - (2k +4)n +1.\n\nThis discriminant must be a perfect square. This seems complicated, but maybe choose k such that this simplifies.\n\nSuppose k=3. Then:\n\nD= (9 -4)n² - (6 +4)n +1=5n² -10n +1.\n\nWe need 5n² -10n +1 to be a perfect square. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, set k=2:\n\nD=(4-4)n² - (4 +4)n +1=0 -8n +1= -8n +1. Negative for n≥1, so no solution.\n\nk=4:\n\nD=(16-4)n² - (8+4)n +1=12n² -12n +1. Need 12n² -12n +1 to be square. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k=1:\n\nD=(1-4)n² - (2+4)n +1= -3n² -6n +1. Negative for n≥1, so no solution.\n\nNot helpful. Let's try another approach.\n\nSuppose we set m = n + d, where d is some integer. Then we can express everything in terms of n and d.\n\nLet m = n + d. Substitute into the equation:\n\n(n + d)(n + d +1) + n(n +1) = k(n + d)n.\n\nExpand:\n\n(n² + (2d +1)n + d² + d) + (n² +n) = k(n² + dn).\n\nCombine terms:\n\n2n² + (2d +2)n + d² + d = kn² + kdn.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(2 -k)n² + (2d +2 - kd)n + d² + d =0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in n. For integral solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square:\n\nD = [2d +2 - kd]^2 -4(2 -k)(d² +d).\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a family of solutions where m and n are related such that m divides n+1 and n divides m+1. Earlier, we saw that if m divides n+1 and n divides m+1, then we can create a system of equations leading to a solution. Let's suppose that m divides n+1 and n divides m+1. Then we can write:\n\nn+1 = a m\n\nm+1 = b n\n\nWhere a and b are positive integers. Then substituting the second equation into the first:\n\nn +1 = a m = a (b n -1)\n\nSo:\n\nn +1 = a b n -a\n\nRearrange:\n\nn - a b n = -a -1\n\nn(1 - a b) = - (a +1 )\n\nThus,\n\nn = (a +1 ) / (a b -1 )\n\nSimilarly, from m = b n -1,\n\nm = b*(a +1)/(a b -1 ) -1 = [b(a +1) - (a b -1)] / (a b -1 )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nab + b -ab +1 = b +1\n\nThus,\n\nm = (b +1 ) / (a b -1 )\n\nSo both m and n are expressed as fractions. For m and n to be positive integers, the denominators a b -1 must divide the numerators a +1 and b +1 respectively, and the results must be positive. Hence, a b -1 must be a positive divisor of both a +1 and b +1. \n\nLet's look for integer values a and b such that a b -1 divides a +1 and b +1. Let's set a = b. Then:\n\na b -1 = a² -1 = (a -1)(a +1). So (a -1)(a +1) must divide a +1. Therefore, (a -1)(a +1) divides a +1. This implies that (a -1) divides 1. Hence, a -1 =1 ⇒ a=2. So a=2, b=2.\n\nThen,\n\nn = (2 +1)/(2*2 -1) =3/3=1\n\nm=(2 +1)/(2*2 -1)=3/3=1\n\nSo m=1,n=1. Which is a solution but trivial.\n\nAlternatively, let's set a=1. Then n = (1 +1)/(1*b -1) =2/(b -1). For n to be integer, b -1 must divide 2. So b-1=1 or 2. Hence, b=2 or 3.\n\nIf b=2:\n\nn=2/1=2\n\nm=(2 +1)/(1*2 -1)=3/1=3\n\nSo m=3, n=2. Check: (3+1)/2 + (2+1)/3=2 +1=3. Good.\n\nIf b=3:\n\nn=2/(3-1)=1\n\nm=(3+1)/(1*3 -1)=4/2=2\n\nCheck: (2+1)/1 + (1+1)/2=3 +1=4. Good.\n\nThese solutions are known. Let's try a=2, b=3.\n\nThen,\n\nn=(2+1)/(2*3 -1)=3/5. Not integer. Doesn't work.\n\na=2, b=4:\n\nn=(2+1)/(2*4 -1)=3/7. Not integer.\n\na=1, b=4:\n\nn=(1+1)/(1*4 -1)=2/3. Not integer.\n\na=3, b=2:\n\nn=(3+1)/(3*2 -1)=4/5. No.\n\nAlternatively, try a=2, b=1.\n\nThen n=(2+1)/(2*1 -1)=3/1=3\n\nm=(1+1)/(2*1 -1)=2/1=2\n\nCheck: (2+1)/3 + (3+1)/2=1 +2=3. Good.\n\nSo this gives m=2, n=3. Which works.\n\nSo, the pairs (m,n)=(3,2) and (2,3) come from a=1,b=2 and a=2,b=1.\n\nBut how do we get infinitely many solutions? Let's see if we can find a pattern or a way to generate larger solutions.\n\nSuppose we start with a solution (m,n) and generate a larger one. Let's say (m,n) = (2,3). Let's try to find another solution based on this.\n\nFrom the equations:\n\nn+1 = a m ⇒ 3+1 = a*2 ⇒ a=2.\n\nm+1 = b n ⇒ 2+1 = b*3 ⇒ b=1.\n\nSo we have a=2, b=1.\n\nIf we could find another pair (a,b) that leads to larger m and n, maybe we can iterate.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we have a solution (m,n). Then swap m and n and see if that's also a solution. For example, if (m,n) is a solution, then (n,m) is also a solution because the expression is symmetric. Indeed, (2,3) and (3,2) are both solutions. But this doesn't help us generate new solutions, just swaps existing ones.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to generate a chain of solutions. For example, starting with (1,1):\n\nFrom (1,1):\n\nSet m=1, n=1. Then:\n\nn+1=2 =a*1 ⇒a=2\n\nm+1=2 =b*1 ⇒b=2\n\nBut then substituting back, we get n=(2+1)/(2*2 -1)=3/3=1. So it loops.\n\nAnother idea: Suppose we have a solution (m,n). Let's try to find a larger solution (m',n') where m' = n +1. Let's see.\n\nFor example, starting with (2,3):\n\nIf m' =3 +1=4. Then we need to find n' such that (4+1)/n' + (n'+1)/4 is integer.\n\nLet's compute this for different n':\n\nn'=1: 5/1 +2/4=5 +0.5=5.5 → not integer.\n\nn'=2:5/2 +3/4=2.5 +0.75=3.25→no.\n\nn'=3:5/3 +4/4≈1.666+1=2.666→no.\n\nn'=4:5/4 +5/4=2.5→no.\n\nn'=5:5/5 +6/4=1 +1.5=2.5→no.\n\nn'=6:5/6 +7/4≈0.833+1.75=2.583→no.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's suppose that m and n are both greater than some number, and try to find solutions where the expression equals 3. Let's set k=3.\n\nSo:\n\n(m+1)/n + (n+1)/m =3\n\nMultiply by mn:\n\nm(m+1) +n(n+1)=3mn\n\nRearrange:\n\nm² +m +n² +n -3mn=0\n\nThis is similar to a quadratic in m:\n\nm² + (1 -3n)m +n² +n =0\n\nDiscriminant:\n\nD=(1 -3n)^2 -4*1*(n² +n)=1 -6n +9n² -4n² -4n=5n² -10n +1\n\nWe need 5n² -10n +1 to be a perfect square.\n\nLet’s denote D= y².\n\nSo:\n\n5n² -10n +1 = y²\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n25n² -50n +5 =5y²\n\nLet’s complete the square on the left:\n\n25n² -50n +25 -20 =5y²\n\n(5n -5)^2 -20 =5y²\n\nLet x =5n -5. Then:\n\nx² -20 =5y² ⇒ x² -5y²=20\n\nThis is a Pell-type equation: x² -5y²=20.\n\nWe can look for integer solutions (x,y) to this equation.\n\nThe general solution to Pell equations is known, but since this is a quadratic form, we can find solutions recursively.\n\nFirst, find initial solutions. Let's try small x and y.\n\nx=5: 25 -5y²=20 ⇒5y²=5 ⇒y=1. So x=5, y=1. Then 5n -5=5 ⇒n=2. Check with n=2:\n\nOriginal equation:5*2² -10*2 +1=20 -20 +1=1=1². Yes. So y=1.\n\nThen, this gives n=2. Let's find m:\n\nFrom the quadratic equation:\n\nm² + (1 -3*2)m +2² +2=0 ⇒m² -5m +6=0 ⇒(m-2)(m-3)=0 ⇒m=2 or 3. Which corresponds to the solutions (2,3) and (3,2).\n\nAnother solution: x=10, y²=(100 -20)/5=16 ⇒y=4. Check x=10: 10² -5*4²=100-80=20. Yes. Then 5n -5=10 ⇒n=3. Check n=3:\n\n5*9 -30 +1=45-30+1=16=4². Correct. Then m² + (1 -9)m +9 +3=0 ⇒m² -8m +12=0 ⇒(m-6)(m-2)=0 ⇒m=6 or 2. So solutions (6,3) and (2,3). Check (6,3):\n\n(6+1)/3 + (3+1)/6=7/3 +4/6=7/3 +2/3=9/3=3. Yes. So (6,3) is a solution.\n\nSimilarly, x=15: x²=225 ⇒225 -5y²=20 ⇒5y²=205 ⇒y²=41, not square. No.\n\nNext, x=20: x²=400. 400 -5y²=20 ⇒5y²=380 ⇒y²=76. No.\n\nx=25:625 -5y²=20 ⇒5y²=605 ⇒y²=121 ⇒y=11. So x=25, y=11. Then n=(25+5)/5=6. Check n=6:\n\n5*36 -60 +1=180-60+1=121=11². Correct. Then m² + (1 -18)m +36 +6=0 ⇒m² -17m +42=0. Solutions m=(17±√(289-168))/2=(17±√121)/2=(17±11)/2. Thus m=(28)/2=14 or m=6/2=3. So solutions (14,6) and (3,6). Check (14,6):\n\n(14+1)/6 + (6+1)/14=15/6 +7/14=2.5 +0.5=3. Yes. So (14,6) works.\n\nSimilarly, we can generate solutions by finding more (x,y) pairs. For example, the next solution can be generated using the recurrence for Pell equations. The equation x² -5y²=20 has solutions that can be generated from the fundamental solution (5,1) using the recursion:\n\nx_{k+1} = x_1 x_k + 5 y_1 y_k\n\ny_{k+1} = x_1 y_k + y_1 x_k\n\nWhere (x_1, y_1)=(5,1). So:\n\nNext solution after (5,1):\n\nx2=5*5 +5*1*1=25 +5=30\n\ny2=5*1 +1*5=5 +5=10\n\nCheck:30² -5*10²=900 -500=400≠20. Wait, that's not correct. Hmm, maybe the recursion is different. Pell equations usually have recursion based on the fundamental solution's multiples. Maybe multiply by the fundamental solution of the Pell equation x² -5y²=1, which is (9,4), since 9² -5*4²=81-80=1.\n\nBut we have x² -5y²=20. The solutions can be generated by multiplying the fundamental solution (5,1) by (9+4√5)^k.\n\nLet’s compute the next solution:\n\n(5 +1√5)(9 +4√5)=5*9 +5*4√5 +9√5 +4*5=45 +20√5 +9√5 +20=65 +29√5. Thus x=65, y=29. Check 65² -5*29²=4225 -5*841=4225 -4205=20. Yes.\n\nThus, n=(65 +5)/5=70/5=14. Check n=14:\n\n5*14² -10*14 +1=5*196 -140 +1=980 -140 +1=841=29². Correct. Then solving for m:\n\nm² + (1 -3*14)m +14² +14=0 ⇒m² -41m +210=0 ⇒m=(41±√(1681-840))/2=(41±√841)/2=(41±29)/2. Thus m=(70)/2=35 or m=12/2=6. So solutions (35,14) and (6,14). Check (35,14):\n\n(35+1)/14 + (14+1)/35=36/14 +15/35=18/7 +3/7=21/7=3. Correct.\n\nThus, each time we can generate a new solution by using the next (x,y) pair from the Pell equation. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions where the expression equals 3. Hence, there are infinitely many pairs (m,n).\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved by recognizing that setting the expression equal to 3 leads to a Pell equation with infinitely many solutions, which in turn generate infinitely many pairs (m,n).",
