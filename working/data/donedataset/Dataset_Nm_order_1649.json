    "Content": "I have to prove the condensation test of Cauchy by tomorrow and I am really unconfident about what I did: $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n\\text{ converges } \\iff\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 2^n a_{2^n}\\text{ converges}$$ I did the following: Let $(b_n)$ be a sequence as follow: $b_{2^k+m}:=a_{2^k}$ with $k\\in\\mathbb N_0$ and $0\\leq m<2^k$. It's $a_{n+1}\\leq a_n$ and so $0\\leq a_{n+p}\\leq a_n$ for all $n,p\\in\\mathbb N$. So $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty b_n$ converges by the majorizing series $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty a_n$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a_n$ be nonincreasing and nonnegative (this just follows from $a_{n+1}\\leq a_n$) Now we will use the comparison test: Let $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_{n}$ be convergent.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about proving the Cauchy condensation test. The statement given is that a series ∑aₙ converges if and only if the condensed series ∑2ⁿa_{2ⁿ} converges. The user provided their attempt and wants to know if it's correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Cauchy condensation test states. The test applies to a non-increasing sequence of non-negative terms aₙ. The test says that the convergence of ∑aₙ is equivalent to the convergence of ∑2ⁿa_{2ⁿ}. \n\nLooking at the user's proof:\n\nFor the forward direction (⇒), they constructed a sequence b_n where b_{2^k + m} = a_{2^k} for k ∈ N₀ and 0 ≤ m < 2^k. They argue that since a_{n+1} ≤ a_n, the terms of b_n are each less than or equal to a_n, so ∑b_n converges because it's majorized by ∑a_n. Then, summing b_n gives ∑_{n=0}^∞ ∑_{m=0}^{2^n -1} a_{2^{n+1}} which simplifies to ∑2^{n-1}a_{2^{n+1}}, but they equate this to ∑2^{n-1}a_{2^n} somehow? Wait, maybe there's an index shift here. Let me check. If n starts at 0, then 2^{n+1} would be 2,4,8,... so shifting the index. But when they sum over n from 0 to ∞, the inner sum would be 2^n terms (from m=0 to 2^n -1) each equal to a_{2^{n+1}}. So each term in the outer sum is 2^n * a_{2^{n+1}}, so the total sum would be ∑_{n=0}^∞ 2^n a_{2^{n+1}}} which is the same as ∑_{k=1}^∞ 2^{k-1} a_{2^k} (by substituting k = n+1). But the user writes it as ∑_{n=1}^∞ 2^{n-1}a_{2^n}, which is correct. So they have that ∑b_n = ∑2^{n-1}a_{2^n} and since this converges, then multiplying by 2 gives ∑2^n a_{2^n} converges. Wait, but the user says \"so ⇒ is done\". But actually, if ∑aₙ converges, then ∑b_n converges, which is half of the sum we need. But ∑2^{n-1}a_{2^n} converges implies that ∑2^n a_{2^n} converges as well, since it's just twice the sum. So that direction seems okay.\n\nFor the reverse direction (⇐), the user constructs c_n similarly, where c_{2^k + m} = a_{2^k} for 0 ≤ m < 2^k. They argue that |a_n| ≤ c_n, but since a_n is non-increasing, when n is between 2^k and 2^{k+1} -1, a_n ≥ a_{2^{k+1}} because the sequence is non-increasing. Wait, actually, if the sequence is non-increasing, then a_{2^k} ≥ a_{2^k +1} ≥ ... ≥ a_{2^{k+1}-1}. So when they define c_n as a_{2^k} for n in [2^k, 2^{k+1}-1}, then each term a_n in that interval is less than or equal to c_n, which is a_{2^k}. Wait, no, because a_n is non-increasing, so a_{2^k} is the first term of the block, and each subsequent a_n is smaller. So actually, c_n would be equal to a_{2^k}, which is larger than or equal to a_n in that interval. Therefore, ∑c_n is a majorant for ∑a_n. If ∑c_n converges, then ∑a_n converges. But ∑c_n is ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k}, which is the condensed series. Therefore, if the condensed series converges, then ∑a_n converges. \n\nWait, but in the user's explanation, they wrote that ∑c_n equals ∑2^n a_{2^n}. So if the condensed series ∑2^n a_{2^n} converges, then ∑c_n converges, which implies ∑a_n converges. That seems correct.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any mistakes in the user's reasoning. Let me go step by step.\n\nIn the forward direction (⇒): Assume ∑aₙ converges. Since aₙ is non-increasing, then a_{2^{n+1}} ≤ a_{2^{n}+m} for m ≥0. The user constructs b_n such that each term in the block [2^n, 2^{n+1}-1] is a_{2^{n+1}}. Therefore, each term b_n is less than or equal to a_n (since a_{2^{n+1}} ≤ a_n in that interval). Therefore, ∑b_n ≤ ∑a_n, hence converges. Then ∑b_n = ∑_{n=0}^∞ 2^n a_{2^{n+1}}} = ∑_{k=1}^∞ 2^{k-1} a_{2^k}}. Then multiplying by 2 gives ∑_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k}} = 2∑b_n, which also converges. Hence, ∑2^k a_{2^k} converges. So that direction is correct.\n\nFor the reverse direction (⇐): Assume ∑2^n a_{2^n} converges. Construct c_n as a_{2^n} in each block. Then since a_n is non-increasing, in each block [2^n, 2^{n+1}-1], the terms a_k are ≤ a_{2^n} (since k ≥2^n implies a_k ≤ a_{2^n}). Therefore, ∑a_k in each block is ≤ 2^n a_{2^n}. Therefore, ∑a_n = ∑_{n=0}^∞ ∑_{k=2^n}^{2^{n+1}-1} a_k ≤ ∑_{n=0}^∞ 2^n a_{2^n} = ∑2^n a_{2^n} which converges. Hence, by comparison, ∑a_n converges. \n\nWait, but in the user's explanation, they said that ∑c_n is equal to ∑_{n=0}^∞ ∑_{m=0}^{2^n -1} a_{2^n}} which is ∑_{n=0}^∞ 2^n a_{2^n}, and since this converges, then ∑a_n converges because |a_n| ≤ c_n. But since a_n is non-negative and non-increasing, they can compare a_n to c_n. So their approach seems correct.\n\nBut maybe the user made a mistake in indexing? Let me check. When they define c_{2^k + m} = a_{2^k} for 0 ≤ m < 2^k. So for k=0, 2^0=1, m=0: c_1 = a_1. For k=1, 2^1=2, m=0,1: c_2 = a_2, c_3 = a_2. For k=2, 2^2=4, m=0,1,2,3: c_4 = a_4, c5=a4, c6=a4, c7=a4, etc. Then ∑c_n = a_1 + 2*a_2 + 4*a_4 + 8*a_8 + ... = ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k}. But the original condensed series is ∑_{n=1}^∞ 2^n a_{2^n}. Wait, when k=0: 2^0 a_{2^0} =1* a_1. Then k=1: 2^1 a_2, etc. So ∑c_n = ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} which is the same as the condensed series except starting from k=0 instead of n=1. But if the original series starts from n=1, then the condensed series would start from 2^1=2. Wait, the user's problem statement says ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^n a_{2^n}. So perhaps the indices need to be adjusted. If the original series is ∑_{n=1}^\\infty a_n, then the condensed series is ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^n a_{2^n}. But when constructing c_n starting from k=0, we get 2^0 a_{2^0} = a_1, which is term n=1. Then 2^1 a_2, which is term n=2. So ∑_{k=0}^\\infty 2^k a_{2^k} is the same as ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^{n-1} a_{2^{n-1}}} shifted? Wait, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nIf we let k start at 0, then 2^k a_{2^k} for k=0 is 1*a_1, which is 2^0 a_{2^0} = a_1. Then k=1: 2^1 a_2, k=2: 2^2 a_4, etc. So the condensed series as per the problem is ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^n a_{2^n} = 2a_2 + 4a_4 + 8a_8 + ... which is ∑_{k=1}^\\infty 2^k a_{2^k}. But the user's sum ∑c_n is a_1 + 2a_2 +4a_4 +... = ∑_{k=0}^\\infty 2^k a_{2^k}. So if the condensed series ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^n a_{2^n} converges, then ∑c_n = a_1 + ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^{n} a_{2^{n}}} converges as well, since it's just adding a_1. Therefore, ∑c_n converges implies ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^n a_{2^n} converges, and vice versa. But in the problem statement, the equivalence is between ∑aₙ and ∑2ⁿa_{2ⁿ}. So in the reverse direction, assuming ∑2ⁿa_{2ⁿ} converges, then ∑c_n = a_1 + ∑2ⁿa_{2ⁿ} converges, hence ∑a_n converges. So the user's argument holds.\n\nHowever, in the user's explanation for the reverse direction, they wrote \"∑c_n = ∑_{n=0}^\\infty ∑_{m=0}^{2^n -1} a_{2^n} = ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^{n} a_{2^n}\". But actually, when n starts at 0, ∑_{m=0}^{2^0 -1} a_{2^0} is ∑_{m=0}^0 a_1 = a_1. Then for n=1, ∑_{m=0}^{1} a_2 = 2*a_2. For n=2, ∑_{m=0}^{3} a_4 = 4*a_4, etc. So indeed, ∑c_n = a_1 + 2a_2 + 4a_4 + ... = ∑_{n=0}^\\infty 2^n a_{2^n}. But the condensed series is ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^n a_{2^n}. Therefore, ∑c_n = a_1 + ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 2^n a_{2^n}. So if the condensed series converges, then ∑c_n converges because it's just adding a_1. Hence, ∑a_n ≤ ∑c_n, so ∑a_n converges. So the user's reasoning is correct here.\n\nIn the forward direction, the user constructed b_n such that each block [2^k, 2^{k+1} -1] is filled with a_{2^{k+1}}. Then ∑b_n = ∑_{k=0}^\\infty 2^k a_{2^{k+1}}} = ∑_{k=1}^\\infty 2^{k-1} a_{2^k}}. Since ∑a_n converges and b_n ≤ a_n, then ∑b_n converges. Therefore, ∑2^{k-1} a_{2^k}} converges, and multiplying by 2 gives ∑2^k a_{2^k}} converges. Hence, the condensed series converges.\n\nThe user's proof seems correct in both directions. They used the comparison test appropriately by constructing majorizing and minorizing series. However, in their write-up, they might have some confusion in indexing, but mathematically the steps are valid. The key assumptions here are that the sequence a_n is non-increasing and non-negative. The user mentioned \"It's a_{n+1} ≤ a_n and so 0 ≤ a_{n+p} ≤ a_n for all n,p ∈ N\", which covers the non-increasing and non-negativity conditions. However, in the original problem statement, the Cauchy condensation test requires that a_n is non-negative and non-increasing. The user's problem statement might not have explicitly mentioned non-negativity, but in their solution, they used 0 ≤ a_{n+p} ≤ a_n, which assumes non-negativity. Therefore, the assumptions should include that a_n is non-negative and non-increasing.\n\nLooking back at the original question, the user wrote: \"Let $(b_n)$ be a sequence as follow: $b_{2^k+m}:=a_{2^k}$ with $k\\in\\mathbb N_0$ and $0\\leq m<2^k$. It's $a_{n+1}\\leq a_n$ and so $0\\leq a_{n+p}\\leq a_n$ for all $n,p\\in\\mathbb N$.\" Here, the user assumes the sequence is non-increasing (a_{n+1} ≤ a_n) and non-negative (0 ≤ a_{n+p} ≤ a_n). So they do include the necessary conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should list that a_n is non-negative, non-increasing, and the problem is to prove the equivalence of convergence between ∑aₙ and ∑2ⁿa_{2ⁿ}.\n\nSo when structuring the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $a_n$ is non-negative.\n- $a_n$ is non-increasing.\n- The problem is to prove that ∑aₙ converges if and only if ∑2ⁿa_{2ⁿ} converges.",
