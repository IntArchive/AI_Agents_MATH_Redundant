    "Content": "I saw this link and had a problem with the first proof on the accepted answer, namely:\n$\\newcommand{\\R}{\\mathbb{R}}$ $\\newcommand{\\raw}{\\rightarrow}$ $\\newcommand{\\N}{\\mathbb{N}}$ $\\newcommand{\\Q}{\\mathbb{Q}}$ $\\newcommand{\\Raw}{\\Rightarrow}$ Suppose that $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ and define a function $g:\\R\\raw\\R$ by $g(x)=1/f(x)$. Prove that $g$ has no roots. I found this hard to make sense of. For certain functions, for example $f(x) = x^2$ it is obvious that $1/f(x)$ will have no roots, however I became confused when considering the case $f(x) = 1/x^2$, because then $g(x) = x^2$ which has a repeating root at $(0,0)$. Can anyone explain to me where I am making a mistake?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your issue is a misunderstanding of the notation $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$. In modern math, the notation $f:A \\to B\\;$means that $f$ is function whose domain is exactly equal to $A$, and whose range (or image) is a subset of $B$. In particular, if we have $f:A \\to B$, then $f(x)$ is defined for all $x \\in A$. Thus, the notation $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ means that $f$ is a real-valued function such that $f(x)$ is defined, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Now suppose $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$. If $f$ has a real root, $r$ say, there is no function $g:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x) = {\\large{\\frac{1}{f(x)}}}$, else $g(r)$ would be undefined. Based on that observation, the problem itself needs to be reworded so as to assert that $g(x)$ exists. So let's assume that the intended problem was this: Prove that if $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $g:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ are such that $g(x) = {\\large{\\frac{1}{f(x)}}}$, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f,g$ have no real roots. The proof is easy . . . Let $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If $r$ is a root of $f$, then \n$$g(r) = \\frac{1}{f(r)} = \\frac{1}{0}$$\nwhich is undefined, contrary to the assumption that $g:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$. Hence $r$ is not a root of $f$. If $r$ is a root of $g$, then\n\\begin{align*}\n&g(r)=0\\\\[4pt]\n\\implies\\;&\\frac{1}{f(r)}=0\\\\[4pt]\n\\implies\\;&f(r)\\left(\\frac{1}{f(r)}\\right)=f(r)(0)\\\\[4pt]\n\\implies\\;&\\require{cancel}\n\\cancel{f(r)}\n\\left(\n{\\small{\\frac{1}{\\cancel{f(r)}}}}\n\\right)=f(r)(0)\\qquad\\text{[since $f(r) \\ne 0$]}\\\\[4pt]\n\\implies\\;&1=0\\\\[4pt]\n\\end{align*}\ncontradiction. Hence $r$ is not a root of $g$. It follows that $f,g$ have no real roots.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and identify the key assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe user is referring to a proof that a function g has no roots. The setup is that f: R → R and g is defined as g(x) = 1/f(x). They want to prove that g has no roots. However, the user is confused because when f(x) = 1/x², then g(x) = x², which has a root at x=0. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, but the original problem must have had some missing assumptions. The example provided by the user shows that if f(x) is 1/x², then g(x) does have a root. Therefore, the original proof must have relied on certain conditions about f that the user might have overlooked.\n\nLooking at the problem statement again: \"Suppose that f: R → R and define a function g: R → R by g(x) = 1/f(x). Prove that g has no roots.\" The user's confusion arises because, in their example, f(x) = 1/x² leads to g(x) = x², which has a root. Therefore, the original problem's proof must have some implicit assumptions about f that prevent such cases, like f(x) never being zero or undefined. But in the problem statement as given, there's no explicit mention of f being non-zero or f(x) never being zero. So the user is pointing out a flaw in the original proof's assumptions.\n\nBut the task here is to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem as stated by the user says f: R → R, which would imply that f is defined for all real numbers, right? Because if f: R → R, then f(x) must be real for all real x. So, if g(x) = 1/f(x), then f(x) can't be zero anywhere, otherwise 1/f(x) would be undefined. However, the user's example uses f(x) = 1/x², which is not defined at x=0, but the user says f: R → R, which would be incorrect because at x=0, f(x) is undefined. Wait, that's a problem. If f is defined as R → R, then f(x) must be defined for all real x. So f(x) = 1/x² isn't actually a valid function from R to R because it's undefined at x=0. Therefore, maybe the original problem assumes that f is everywhere defined and f(x) ≠ 0 for all x, which would make g(x) = 1/f(x) also a function from R to R, and then g(x) would indeed have no roots because 1/f(x) is never zero. But in the user's example, f(x) = 1/x² isn't a valid R → R function because of the undefined point at x=0. However, the user might have made a mistake here by considering f(x) = 1/x² as a function from R to R, which it isn't. Therefore, the original problem's assumption that f: R → R would require that f is defined everywhere, hence f(x) is never zero (since 1/f(x) must also be defined everywhere). Therefore, in that case, g(x) = 1/f(x) would indeed have no roots because 1/f(x) can't be zero. But the user's confusion comes from considering a function f that isn't actually R → R. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is a function from R to R (so f(x) is defined for all real x)\n2. g is defined as g(x) = 1/f(x)\n3. Therefore, since g must also be a function from R to R, f(x) cannot be zero for any x (otherwise g(x) would be undefined)\n4. Hence, 1/f(x) is never zero, so g has no roots.\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user didn't explicitly mention that f(x) is non-zero everywhere, but it's implied by the fact that g is defined as a function from R to R. Therefore, in structuring the problem, the assumptions should include that f is defined for all real numbers and that f(x) ≠ 0 for all x. Wait, but if f: R → R, then to have g: R → R, f(x) must not be zero anywhere. Otherwise, g would have undefined points. So the fact that g is defined as a function from R to R implies that f(x) is non-zero for all x. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f: R → R\n- g: R → R is defined by g(x) = 1/f(x)\n- Therefore, f(x) ≠ 0 for all x ∈ R\n\nBut the problem the user is confused about is when they considered f(x) = 1/x², which isn't actually a valid R → R function because at x=0, it's undefined. Therefore, the original problem's assumptions must include that f is defined everywhere and f(x) ≠ 0 everywhere, which ensures that g is also defined everywhere and 1/f(x) is never zero. So the formatted problem should list these assumptions.\n\nBut looking at the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the key assumptions are that f is defined for all real numbers (since f: R → R), and that g is also defined as a function from R to R, which requires that f(x) is never zero. So these are the necessary assumptions to ensure that g has no roots.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\ng is defined by g(x) = 1/f(x),\ng is a function from R to R.\n\nProblem:\nProve that g has no roots.\n\nAlternatively, since g being a function from R to R implies that f(x) ≠ 0 for all x, which in turn implies that 1/f(x) is never zero. Therefore, the key assumptions are f: R → R and g: R → R defined by g(x) = 1/f(x). The problem is to prove that g has no roots.\n\nBut maybe the original problem didn't state that g is from R to R, but the user is assuming that. Wait, in the user's problem statement, they write: \"Suppose that f: R → R and define a function g: R → R by g(x) = 1/f(x). Prove that g has no roots.\" So the original problem explicitly states that both f and g are functions from R to R. Therefore, this implies that f(x) is defined everywhere and non-zero everywhere (since otherwise g would not be a function from R to R). Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- f: R → R (so f is defined for all real x)\n- g: R → R is defined by g(x) = 1/f(x)\n- Therefore, f(x) ≠ 0 for all x ∈ R (since otherwise g would not be defined everywhere)\n\nBut in the user's example, f(x) = 1/x² is not a valid R → R function because it's undefined at x=0. Hence, the user's mistake is considering an f that's not actually R → R. Therefore, the original problem's assumptions include that f is defined for all real numbers and that 1/f(x) is also defined for all real numbers, which requires f(x) ≠ 0 for all x. Under these conditions, g(x) = 1/f(x) cannot have roots because 1/f(x) = 0 implies f(x) is infinite, which isn't possible for a real function f: R → R.\n\nTherefore, structuring this, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function from R to R.\n2. g is a function from R to R defined by g(x) = 1/f(x).\n3. (Implicitly) f(x) ≠ 0 for all x ∈ R.\n\nBut the problem as posed by the user might not have explicitly stated the third assumption, but it's necessary for g to be defined. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we need to make these assumptions explicit. However, the original problem might have only stated the first two, with the third being implied. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: R → R\n- g: R → R is defined by g(x) = 1/f(x)\n\nThe problem is to prove that g has no roots. The key here is that since g is defined everywhere (as R → R), f(x) cannot be zero anywhere, so 1/f(x) is never zero, hence g has no roots.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\ng is a function from R to R defined by g(x) = 1/f(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that g has no roots.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes that g is well-defined (i.e., f(x) ≠ 0 for all x), then that's an implicit assumption. However, to make it explicit, perhaps the third assumption should be included. But since the problem states that g is defined as a function from R to R, that already includes the requirement that f(x) ≠ 0 everywhere. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are the first two. Hence, the answer should list those two assumptions and the problem as stated.",
