    "Content": "Let me explain my deal. We can split any positive number into addends, and then we can take those addends and use them now as factors. The product will be maximum if all addends were equal. E.g., the number 10 can be split apart as 9 + 1, or 8 + 2... Many ways. However, if we split it as 5 + 5, the product (5 * 5 = 25) will be the greatest of all possible products. I am very grateful to the person who finally explained it to me in case of just two addends. Suppose we have a number a (it's a parameter, or a \"known unknown\"). We can split it into two addends in multiple ways. Let's denote the first addend as x . Then, the second addend would be a – x . After that, we take our two addends and use them as factors. So the resulting function will be as follows: y = x * (a – x) = ax – x². We now take the first derivative: y' = (ax – x²)' = a – 2x. Now, a – 2x must equal zero. a – 2x = 0; a = 2x; x = a/2 — we got the first addend.\nThe second addend will equal a – a/2 = a/2. Thus, they are equal to each other. [In fact, afterwards we should take the second derivative as well, in order to make sure that we found the point of maximum rather than minimum. y'' = (ax – x²)'' = (a – 2x)' = –2. The second derivative is a negative constant. Hence, x = a/2 is indeed the point of maximum.] However, the problem is that I got the proof for two addends. But what if they are more? (Three, four, and so on.) I am afraid we may obtain a function of two or more variables. Deriving such functions was never pleasurable for me. I am certainly not good at it... So is there maybe a simpler way to prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The idea of changing two terms in order to keep the sum the same while increasing the product is an instance of a general technique called smoothing . This idea was attempted in lulu 's post, but the specific smoothing used there (replace by two copies of the average) fails to prove the desired AM-GM inequality without requiring significant real analysis (which is technically more demanding than the desired theorem), because repeating this process generally does not lead to the case where all the terms are equal. You need to somehow reach that case from where you start, in order to conclude that the all-equal case is indeed the maximum. It turns out that there is a way to do smoothing that actually succeeds in reaching the all-equal case. This way is presented quite clearly in the linked wikipedia page (under the section \"Proof by successive replacement of elements\") . The idea is to not replace by two copies of the average of the two terms, but to replace by the average of all the terms and whatever is left. In case the wikipedia link gets broken, here is the key insight: Let $m$ be the average of all the terms. If there are two terms $x,y$ such that $x < m < y$ , then replace them by $m,x+y-m$ , which preserves the sum but changes the product by $m·(x+y-m)-x·y = (m-x)·(y-m) > 0$ and increases the number of copies of $m$ . So you can only do this at most $n$ times where $n$ is the number of terms. When you cannot do this anymore, there are no such $x,y$ , so either all are at least $m$ or all are at most $m$ . In both cases, they must be all equal to $m$ (since $m$ is their average). I note that this argument is presented in some form by bof and Saikat on the 3rd Math SE thread linked by Izaak van Dongen , but not very clearly. So I prefer mine or wikipedia's instead. Also, the technique of smoothing is really useful but not mentioned at all there or on wikipedia. Here are some examples of its power: Maximizing an expression using brackets Cyclic Polygon Maximum Area & Isoperimetric Polygon Maximum Area [this one does use real analysis]",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that splitting a positive number into equal addends gives the maximum product when those addends are used as factors. They already understand the case with two addends using calculus but are struggling with extending it to more addends. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question correctly. The key points are:\n\n1. The number to split is positive.\n2. Split into multiple addends (not just two).\n3. Convert those addends into factors (i.e., multiply them).\n4. Prove that the maximum product occurs when all addends are equal.\n\nThe example given is splitting 10 into 5+5 gives a product of 25, which is the maximum possible. The user provided a calculus-based proof for two variables but is concerned about handling more variables. They’re looking for a simpler method, possibly avoiding multivariable calculus.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n- The number being split is positive. Let's call it 'a'.\n- Split into 'k' addends, where 'k' is a positive integer greater than 1.\n- Each addend is a positive real number.\n- The product of these addends is to be maximized.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"split any positive number into addends,\" so the number is positive, split into addends which are also positive. Then, the product is maximized when all addends are equal. The problem is to prove this for any number of addends, not just two.\n\nThe user is asking for a method that doesn't involve multivariable calculus, which they find complicated. So, possible approaches could be using the AM-GM inequality or induction.\n\nThe AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean, with equality when all numbers are equal. That seems directly applicable here. If we split 'a' into 'k' addends, their sum is 'a'. The arithmetic mean would be a/k. The geometric mean is the product of the addends to the power of 1/k. So, by AM-GM, the product is maximized when all addends are equal to a/k.\n\nBut maybe the user is not familiar with AM-GM, or wants a different approach. Alternatively, using induction: assume that for splitting into k addends, equal ones give maximum product, then prove for k+1. However, induction might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use the two-variable case iteratively. Suppose we have three addends. If they are not all equal, then take two that are unequal and adjust them to be equal while keeping the sum the same, which would increase the product. Repeating this process would lead all addends to become equal. This is similar to the method of smoothing used in optimization.\n\nSo, the structured problem would need to list the assumptions:\n\n- The number to split is a positive real number.\n- The number is split into 'k' addends, where 'k' is a positive integer greater than 1.\n- Each addend is a positive real number.\n- The product of the addends is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the product is maximized when all addends are equal.\n\nWait, the original question didn't specify that the number of addends is fixed. For example, when splitting 10, the user split into two addends. But in the general case, do we fix the number of addends (say, split into k parts) and maximize over all possible splits into k parts? The problem as stated says \"split any positive number into addends\" but doesn't specify if the number of addends is fixed or variable. However, the example given splits into two addends, and the user is asking about more addends, so likely the number of addends is fixed, and we need to split into k equal parts for a given k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is for any split into any number of addends, but the maximum occurs when split into equal addends. But in that case, for example, splitting 10 into two 5s gives 25, but splitting into three 3.333...s gives about 37.037, which is higher. So, perhaps the number of addends is fixed, and we need to maximize for that fixed k.\n\nSo the problem should specify that we split the number into a fixed number of addends k, and prove that the maximum product occurs when all addends are equal. Otherwise, the maximum product would increase as k increases (up to a point), but that's a different problem.\n\nLooking at the original question: \"split any positive number into addends... the product will be maximum if all addends were equal.\" The example splits 10 into two 5s. The user then asks about more than two addends. So, the key is, given a fixed number of addends, the maximum product is achieved when all are equal. Therefore, the problem should be structured with the assumption that the number is split into a fixed number of addends k, each positive, and the product is maximized when they are equal.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The number to split is a positive real number.\n- The number is split into k addends, where k is a fixed positive integer.\n- Each addend is a positive real number.\n- The sum of the addends equals the original number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the product of the addends is maximized when all addends are equal.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem didn't specify k, but the example used two, but the user is asking about more, perhaps the problem is to split into any number of addends (not fixed k), but then the maximum product is achieved when all addends are equal. However, in that case, the maximum product would be when you split into as many addends as possible (approaching e), but that contradicts the example given where splitting into two 5s gives a higher product than other splits into two parts.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that the number is split into a fixed number of addends k, and the maximum product is achieved when all addends are equal. Hence, the problem is to prove that for a fixed k, splitting the number into k equal parts maximizes the product.\n\nSo, the structured format should have assumptions:\n\n- The original number is a positive real number.\n- The number is split into k addends, where k is a fixed positive integer.\n- Each addend is a positive real number.\n- The sum of the addends equals the original number.\n- The product of the addends is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the product is maximized when all addends are equal.\n\nBut in the user's example, for two addends, they used calculus. So, perhaps in the problem statement, the number of addends is variable (like any number, not fixed). Wait, the user says: \"But what if they are more? (Three, four, and so on.)\" So they are considering splitting into three, four, etc., addends, but the problem is for any number of addends. However, in the original problem statement, it's not clear if the number of addends is fixed or variable. Wait, the original problem says: \"We can split any positive number into addends, and then we can take those addends and use them now as factors. The product will be maximum if all addends were equal.\" So the statement is that splitting into any number of addends (not fixed) and the product is maximized when all are equal. However, that's not true because if you split into more addends, you can get a higher product. For example, 10 split into two 5s gives 25, but split into three 3.333s gives approx 37.037, which is higher. So, the original problem must refer to splitting into a fixed number of addends. So the correct interpretation is that given a fixed number of addends, the product is maximized when all are equal.\n\nTherefore, the problem should be structured as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The original number is a positive real number.\n- The number is split into k addends, where k is a fixed positive integer.\n- Each addend is a positive real number.\n- The sum of the addends equals the original number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the product of the addends is maximized when all addends are equal.\n\nNow, considering the example provided by the user for two addends, using calculus. So in the structured problem, the assumptions are similar but generalized to k addends.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe original number is a positive real number,\nThe number is split into $k$ addends where $k$ is a fixed positive integer,\nEach addend is a positive real number,\nThe sum of the addends equals the original number.\nProblem:\nProve that the product of the addends is maximized when all addends are equal.\n###",
