    "Content": "I would like to show that the rational polynomial function $f:\\mathbb{Q}^2\\to\\mathbb{Q}$ defined as $f(x,y)=xy(x+y)$ isn't surjective. To do this, I tried proving that the algebraic plane curve $$K:xy(x+y)=1$$ has no rational points so that $1\\not\\in f[\\mathbb{Q}^2]$ . I then considered the following elliptic curve $$E:v^2-v=u^3$$ which, according to the LMFDB , has the three rational points $E(\\mathbb{Q})=\\{\\mathcal{O},(0,0),(0,1)\\}\\cong\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ . Now, the function $\\psi:K(\\mathbb{Q})\\to E(\\mathbb{Q})$ defined as $\\psi(x,y)=\\left(-\n\\frac{1\n}{x+y},\\frac{y}{x+y}\\right)$ is well defined since $x+y$ isn't annihilated on $K$ and $$v^2-v=\\left(\\frac{y}{x+y}\\right)^2-\\frac{y}{x+y}=\\frac{y^2-y(x+y)}{(x+y)^2}=-\\frac{xy}{(x+y)^2}=-\\frac{1}{(x+y)^3}=u^3$$ with $(u,v)=\\psi(x,y)$ . But this means that $K$ has no rational points since $-\\frac{1}{x+y}\\neq0\\Rightarrow \\psi(x,y)\\not\\in E(\\mathbb{Q}).\\ \\square$ However, this seems too much as it relies on theory of elliptic curves computing the Mordell-Weil group of $E$ . Maybe there's a non-constructive approach which proves that some $q\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ isn't in the image of $f$ without specifying it. Or with elementary number theory employing, for example, modular arithmetic and power residues. So my question then is: Q: Is there an easier approach on proving that $f$ is not surjective?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "With elementary reasoning we can reduce to Fermat's Last Theorem for $n=3$ , which in turn does have an elementary proof (see e.g. Euler's proof ). That is, first write $x=\\frac{r_1}{s_1}$ , $y=\\frac{r_2}{s_2}$ with $\\gcd(r_i,s_i)=1$ , then let $r=\\gcd(r_1,r_2)$ , $s=\\gcd(s_1,s_2)$ , so we may write $x=\\frac{p_1r}{q_1s}$ , $y=\\frac{p_2r}{q_2s}$ with $\\gcd(p_1,p_2)=\\gcd(q_1,q_2)=1$ . We assume only $q_1$ and $q_2$ may be negative. We claim that we can never have $xy(x+y)=1$ .  To see this, suppose otherwise and expand to obtain $$1=\\frac{r^3(p_1q_2+q_1p_2)p_1p_2}{s^3q_1^2q_2^2}.$$ From the fact that $r$ is positive and coprime to $s$ , $q_1$ , and $q_2$ , we have $r=1$ .  Moreover,  since $q_1$ is coprime to $p_1$ and $q_2$ , it is coprime to $(p_1q_2+q_1p_2)$ , and therefore we have $q_1^2|p_2$ , and similarly $q_2^2|p_1$ . Now writing $p_1=k_1q_2^2$ , $p_2=k_2q_1^2$ we have $$1=\\frac{(k_1q_2^3+k_2q_1^3)k_1q_2^2k_2q_1^2}{s^3q_1^2q_2^2}=\\frac{(k_1q_2^3+k_2q_1^3)k_1k_2}{s^3}.$$ Since $p_i$ and $s$ are coprime and positive we then have $k_1=k_2=1$ , so that $$1=\\frac{q_2^3+q_1^3}{s^3}$$ the desired contradiction to Fermat's Last Theorem for $n=3$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the function f(x, y) = xy(x + y) from Q² to Q isn't surjective. The original approach used elliptic curves and showed that the curve xy(x + y) = 1 has no rational points by mapping it to an elliptic curve with only a few rational points. But the user is asking for a simpler method, maybe using number theory or a non-constructive approach.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what surjective means here. For f to be surjective, every rational number q should be expressible as xy(x + y) for some rational x and y. The user wants to show that there's at least one q in Q that isn't in the image of f. The example given in the problem was q=1, leading to the curve K: xy(x + y) = 1, which they showed has no rational points via elliptic curves. But maybe there's a more straightforward way to see that 1 can't be expressed as such, or perhaps another q.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. The user mentioned modular arithmetic or power residues. Maybe we can assume that there exist integers a, b, c (since we can clear denominators) such that xy(x + y) = 1, and then reduce modulo some integer to find a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the method of infinite descent. Suppose there is a solution in rational numbers, then clear denominators to get a solution in integers. Then analyze the equation in integers and show that such a solution can't exist.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Suppose there are integers x, y, z (with z ≠ 0) such that (x/z)(y/z)(x/z + y/z) = 1. Multiplying both sides by z³ gives x y (x + y) = z³. So we need to find integers x, y, z such that x y (x + y) = z³. If we can show that this equation has no non-trivial solutions (other than z=0, which would lead to x or y being zero, but then the left-hand side would be zero, not 1), then we have a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can look at the equation x y (x + y) = 1 in rationals. Suppose x = a/b and y = c/d in reduced form. Then the equation becomes (a/b)(c/d)(a/b + c/d) = 1. Combining terms, (a c (a d + b c)) / (b² d²) = 1. So the numerator must equal the denominator: a c (a d + b c) = b² d². This seems complicated, but maybe by considering divisibility conditions, we can find a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, consider scaling variables. Let’s set x = p, y = q, both rationals. Then, we can write p = a/t, q = b/t where a, b, t are integers with t > 0 and gcd(a, b, t) = 1. Substituting into the equation: (a/t)(b/t)( (a + b)/t ) = 1. This simplifies to ab(a + b) = t³. So we need integers a, b, t with ab(a + b) = t³. If we can show that such a, b, t cannot exist unless t=0, which would not give a valid solution, then we are done.\n\nSo let's suppose a, b, t are integers with ab(a + b) = t³. Let’s analyze this equation. Maybe we can use properties of integers, such as prime factorization. Suppose p is a prime dividing t. Then p³ divides ab(a + b). Let's consider the exponents of p in a, b, and a + b.\n\nAssume that p divides a and p divides b. Then p divides a + b as well. Let’s say p^k || a, p^m || b, and p^n || a + b. Then the exponent of p in ab(a + b) is k + m + n. For this to be a cube, k + m + n must be a multiple of 3. But since p divides a, b, and a + b, we can write a = p^k a', b = p^m b', where p doesn't divide a' or b'. Then a + b = p^k a' + p^m b'. Depending on k and m, the exponent n would be min(k, m) if k ≠ m. Suppose k ≤ m. Then a + b = p^k (a' + p^{m - k} b'), so n = k + exponent of p in (a' + p^{m - k} b'). If p divides a' + p^{m - k} b', then n would be k + 1, but that depends on a' and b'. This might get complicated, but maybe if we choose p=2 or p=3 and look at possible exponents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that if ab(a + b) is a cube, then each prime in its factorization must appear with an exponent divisible by 3. Let's suppose that a and b are coprime. If gcd(a, b) = 1, then since a and b are coprime, a and b must each be cubes, and a + b must also be a cube. But if a, b are coprime cubes, then their sum being a cube would contradict Fermat's Last Theorem for exponent 3, which says there are no non-trivial solutions to x³ + y³ = z³. However, FLT applies to positive integers, but here we could have negative integers. Wait, but in the rational case, if we have a + b = c³, with a and b being cubes, then this would require c³ - a = b, so unless one of them is zero, which would make the product zero, but we need the product to be t³. Wait, but if a and b are cubes, say a = d³ and b = e³, then ab(a + b) = d³ e³ (d³ + e³) = t³. So d³ + e³ must be a cube, which by FLT implies that one of d or e is zero. Then either a or b is zero, which would make ab(a + b) = 0, contradicting t³ being non-zero. Thus, in this case, if a and b are coprime, then the only solution is a or b zero, which isn't allowed, so no solution exists. Therefore, ab(a + b) cannot be a cube if a and b are coprime, implying that there are no non-trivial solutions, hence no rational points on the curve xy(x + y)=1.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about showing that f is not surjective, so showing that 1 is not in the image. If we can show that ab(a + b) cannot be a cube for non-zero integers a, b, then this would suffice. But this seems to be exactly the approach using FLT. However, FLT for exponent 3 is quite a heavy theorem. The original approach used elliptic curves, which is also non-trivial, but the user is asking for something simpler. Maybe there's a way to use infinite descent here without invoking FLT.\n\nAlternatively, consider modulo 9. Let's see if we can find a contradiction modulo 9. Suppose there exist integers a, b, t such that ab(a + b) = t³. Let's analyze this equation modulo 9. Cubes modulo 9 are 0, 1, and -1. So t³ ≡ 0, 1, or -1 mod 9. Let's see what possible values ab(a + b) can take modulo 9.\n\nCompute ab(a + b) mod 9 for all possible a, b mod 9. Since modulo 9 has 9 residues, this is feasible. If we can show that ab(a + b) mod 9 is never ≡1 or -1 unless a or b ≡0 mod 9, then perhaps this would lead to a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe show that ab(a + b) ≡ 0 mod 9, implying that t³ ≡0 mod9, hence t≡0 mod3. Then we can factor out 3s and use infinite descent.\n\nWait, suppose that in the equation ab(a + b) = t³, if 3 divides t, then 3³ divides ab(a + b). So 3 divides ab(a + b). If 3 divides a, then 3 divides a. Similarly for b. If 3 divides both a and b, then 3 divides a + b as well. So the exponents of 3 in a, b, and a + b would each be at least 1. Suppose we write a = 3k, b = 3m. Then a + b = 3(k + m). Then ab(a + b) = 3k * 3m * 3(k + m) = 27 k m (k + m). So t³ = 27 k m (k + m), which implies t = 3n, so (3n)³ = 27n³ = 27 k m (k + m), hence n³ = k m (k + m). Now we have a similar equation but with smaller exponents. If we can show that this leads to an infinite descent, then there are no solutions.\n\nIf there exists a solution with minimal t, then from t = 3n, we get a smaller solution with n. But unless k m (k + m) is a multiple of 3, leading to n being a multiple of 3, and so on. Wait, but this seems similar to the proof of FLT for exponent 3. So maybe using infinite descent here, but it's similar to the FLT approach, which is still non-trivial. However, maybe this is considered more elementary than elliptic curves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for a specific rational number that cannot be in the image. The user mentioned 1. Suppose there are x, y ∈ Q such that xy(x + y) = 1. Let’s write x = a/b and y = c/d in lowest terms. Then, as before, we get ab(a d + b c) = (b d)³. Let’s assume that a and b are coprime, and c and d are coprime. Then, the left-hand side is a c (a d + b c). The right-hand side is (b d)³. If we can find that some prime must divide both sides but cannot, that might lead to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, assume that there is a solution in integers (after clearing denominators). Then, suppose x and y are integers (since we can multiply through by denominators). Then xy(x + y) = z³. Suppose x and y are coprime. Then, since x and y are coprime, each must be a cube. Let x = a³, y = b³. Then x + y = a³ + b³. So a³ b³ (a³ + b³) = z³. Thus, a³ + b³ must be a cube. By FLT, this only possible if one of a or b is zero, which would make x or y zero, leading to xy(x + y) = 0, contradicting z³ = 1. Hence, no solution.\n\nThis uses FLT, which is a big theorem, but maybe it's considered more elementary than elliptic curves. However, FLT for exponent 3 was proven using infinite descent by Euler, which is more elementary than the general FLT. So perhaps this is acceptable as an answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we avoid FLT, maybe consider modulo 4. Let’s see. Suppose x and y are integers, and xy(x + y) is a cube. Let's look at modulo 4. Cubes modulo 4 are 0, 1, or -1. Let's see possible values of xy(x + y) mod4.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nIf x or y even, then product is even. If both even, then product is divisible by 8. If one even, then product is even. If both odd, then x + y is even, so product is even * even = divisible by 4. So in any case, the product is even. Therefore, z³ must be even, so z even. Then z³ divisible by 8. So xy(x + y) must be divisible by 8. If x and y are both even, then x = 2a, y = 2b, then product is 8ab(a + b). So ab(a + b) must be a cube. Then same argument applies recursively. This leads to infinite descent. However, if initially one of x or y is even and the other odd, then x + y is odd. So product is even * odd = even. But to be divisible by 8, since x is even and y odd, x = 2a, then product is 2a y (2a + y). If y is odd, 2a + y is odd. Then 2a y (2a + y) must be divisible by 8. So 2a must be divisible by 8, hence a divisible by 4. So x = 8a', then product is 8a' y (8a' + y). But 8a' + y is odd, so y must be even for 8a' + y to be even? No, y is odd. So 8a' + y is odd. Therefore, the product is 8a' y (odd). To be a cube, this would require a' y (odd) being a cube. But since y is odd and a' is even (since a = 4a'), then a' = 2k, so 2k y (odd). This becomes 2k y. Hmm, not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we start with x and y coprime. Then xy(x + y) must be a cube. Since x and y are coprime, x and y must each be cubes, and x + y must also be a cube. But then x = a³, y = b³, and a³ + b³ = c³. Which by FLT, only possible if one is zero. Hence, no solution. Thus, this approach using FLT for exponent 3 would work. Even though FLT is advanced, for exponent 3 it's more elementary and known since Euler.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer could use this approach: Assume there are integers a, b, c with ab(a + b) = c³. If a and b are coprime, then each must be cubes, leading to a contradiction via FLT. If they aren't coprime, factor out the gcd and apply infinite descent. Hence, no solution exists, so 1 is not in the image, hence f is not surjective.\n\nBut the user wants an easier approach. Maybe this is considered easier than elliptic curves. Alternatively, there's another way using valuations or properties of rational numbers.\n\nAnother idea: Assume there exists x, y ∈ Q such that xy(x + y) = 1. Write x = a/b, y = c/d in lowest terms. Then, cross-multiplying gives a c (a d + b c) = b² d². Since the left side must equal the right side, which is a square, perhaps analyze the exponents of primes in both sides. For a prime p dividing the left side, its exponent in a c (a d + b c) would be the sum of exponents in a, c, and (a d + b c). On the right side, it's 2 times exponents in b and d. This might lead to a contradiction for some prime p.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in the equation xy(x + y) = 1, if x and y are in Q, then scaling variables appropriately. Let’s set x = s, y = t/s, where s and t are rational numbers, s ≠ 0. Then substituting into the equation: s*(t/s)*(s + t/s) = t*(s + t/s) = t*s + t²/s = 1. Multiply both sides by s: t s² + t² = s. Rearranged as t s² - s + t² = 0. This is a quadratic in s: t s² - s + t² = 0. For rational solutions s, the discriminant must be a square. The discriminant D = 1 - 4*t*t² = 1 - 4t³. So 1 - 4t³ must be a square in Q. So we need t ∈ Q such that 4t³ + y² = 1 for some y ∈ Q. This is another elliptic curve equation. But solving this might not be easier than the original problem.\n\nHmm, this might not lead anywhere. Let's go back to the integer approach. Suppose there are integers a, b, t with ab(a + b) = t³. Assume that a, b are coprime. Then since a and b are coprime, each divides t³. So a divides t³ and b divides t³. Because they are coprime, a and b must each be cubes. Let a = m³, b = n³. Then m³ n³ (m³ + n³) = t³. Hence, m³ + n³ must be a cube, say p³. So m³ + n³ = p³. By FLT, this implies one of m, n is zero, which would make a or b zero, leading to ab(a + b)=0, contradicting t³=1. Therefore, no solution exists. Hence, 1 is not in the image of f, so f is not surjective.\n\nThis approach uses FLT for exponent 3, which might be considered more elementary than elliptic curves. However, FLT for exponent 3 is still a non-trivial result. Alternatively, maybe we can use infinite descent directly on the equation ab(a + b) = t³ without invoking FLT.\n\nSuppose there is a minimal solution in positive integers a, b, t. If a and b are both even, then divide by 2: a = 2a', b = 2b', t = 2t', leading to 8a'b'(2a' + 2b') = 8t'³ → 2a' b'(a' + b') = t'³. So t' must be even, say t' = 2t'', then 2a' b'(a' + b') = 8t''³ → a' b'(a' + b') = 4t''³. Now, if a' and b' are both even, repeat. If one is even and one odd, then a' + b' is odd. Then the left side is even*even*odd or even*odd*odd, depending on a', b'. Not sure. This seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, if a and b are coprime, then as before, each must be a cube. If they share a common factor d > 1, then set a = d a', b = d b', gcd(a', b')=1. Then ab(a + b) = d³ a' b'(a' + b') = t³. Thus, d³ divides t³, so d divides t, say t = d t'. Then equation becomes a' b'(a' + b') = t'³. Now, since gcd(a', b')=1, as before, a', b', and a' + b' must be cubes. Hence, a' = m³, b' = n³, a' + b' = p³. Thus, m³ + n³ = p³, which by FLT implies one of m or n is zero, leading to a' or b' zero, hence a or b zero, contradiction. Hence, no solution.\n\nThus, the only solutions would require a or b zero, leading to the product being zero, which can't equal 1. Therefore, no solutions exist, so 1 is not in the image, hence f is not surjective.\n\nThis seems to be a valid approach using FLT for exponent 3. If the answerer is allowed to use FLT for n=3, then this is a valid elementary approach. Otherwise, it's still a bit advanced, but maybe more straightforward than elliptic curves.\n\nAnother angle: Use parity. Suppose x and y are both integers. If one is even and the other odd, then x + y is odd. Then xy(x + y) is even * odd = even. If both are even, then xy(x + y) is divisible by 8. If both are odd, then x + y is even, so product is odd * even = even. Thus, the product is always even. Therefore, t³ must be even, so t is even. Then t³ divisible by 8. Hence, if we assume x and y are coprime, then they can't both be even. If one is even and the other odd, then product is even, but not divisible by 8, leading to contradiction. Wait, not necessarily. If x is even and y odd, then x = 2a, y odd. Then xy(x + y) = 2a * y * (2a + y). Since 2a + y is odd, the product is 2a y (odd). To be divisible by 8, 2a must be divisible by 8, so a divisible by 4. Thus, x = 8a'. Then the product is 8a' y (8a' + y). Now, 8a' + y is odd, so 8a' y (odd) = 8a' y * odd. To be a cube, 8a' y * odd must be a cube. 8 is 2³, so a' y * odd must be a cube. But since y is odd and a' is even (since x = 8a'), then a' is even. Let a' = 2a'', then a' = 2a''. So 2a'' y * odd = cube. But now 2a'' y * odd = 2 a'' y * odd. The factors here: 2, a'', y, and odd. If a'' and y are coprime, then 2 must be a cube factor, which it isn't. Contradiction. Hence, no solution. This uses infinite descent without directly invoking FLT, but relies on properties of factors of 2. However, this only handles the case where x and y are integers with one even and one odd. Other cases need to be considered too. If both x and y are even, then we can factor out 2s as before. This infinite descent shows there's no minimal solution, hence no solution exists.\n\nThis approach might work without using FLT. It focuses on the prime 2 and uses infinite descent by showing that any solution would lead to a smaller solution, ad infinitum. Therefore, no solution exists, so 1 isn't in the image. Hence, f isn't surjective.\n\nThis seems like an elementary approach using infinite descent on the prime 2. It's more involved but doesn't require advanced theorems. Therefore, this could be the \"easier approach\" the user is seeking.",
