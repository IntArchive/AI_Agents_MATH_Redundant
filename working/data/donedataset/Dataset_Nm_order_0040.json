    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem correctly. The original question is asking if an irrational number raised to an irrational power can be rational. They also want to know how to prove it if it's possible.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions here. The user wants me to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem: \"Can an irrational number raised to an irrational power be rational?\" So the main objects here are the base and the exponent. Both are supposed to be irrational numbers. The question is whether their combination (the result) can be rational.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions were about the variables involved. In this case, the problem is more general. There are no specific numbers given; it's a general question. So how do I list the assumptions?\n\nThe problem is asking about the existence of two irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational. So maybe the assumptions would be that a and b are irrational numbers, and the problem is to determine if a^b can be rational. But the problem isn't stating any specific conditions on a and b except their irrationality. However, the question is whether such a case exists, not under what conditions. \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the assumptions are just that a and b are irrational, and the problem is to prove whether a^b can be rational. But the user's example had specific conditions. Let me check the original example again.\n\nOriginal example:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in that case, the assumptions were about n's properties. Here, the problem is about two variables, a and b, both irrational. But the question is whether such a and b exist. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number,\nThe problem is to prove whether a^b can be a rational number.\n\nBut the problem statement is a question: \"Can an irrational number raised to an irrational power be rational?\" So maybe the problem part is exactly that question. But according to the user's format, the problem should be stated as a command, like \"Prove that...\", but in this case, it's a yes/no question with a request for proof.\n\nHmm. Wait, the user's example had the problem statement as \"Prove that...\". But here, the problem is phrased as a question. But according to the format given, the problem should be stated as a directive. So maybe rephrase the question as \"Prove whether an irrational number raised to an irrational power can be rational.\" But the original question in Vietnamese might need to be translated accurately.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to structure the problem in the given format. The example shows that the original problem's assumptions were split into individual lines, each about one object. So here, the problem is about two irrational numbers a and b, and whether a^b is rational. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve whether a^b can be rational.\n\nBut in the original problem, there's also \"If it can be rational, how can one prove it?\" So the problem is both asking if it's possible and to prove it. So the problem statement should encapsulate both parts. So the problem part would be: \"Prove whether an irrational number raised to an irrational power can be rational. If possible, provide a proof.\"\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is simply \"Can an irrational number raised to an irrational power be rational? If it can be rational, how can one prove it?\" So maybe the problem is as stated. But in the example, the problem was rewritten into a \"Prove that...\" statement. However, in this case, the problem is a yes/no question with a request for proof. So how to structure that?\n\nWait, the user's example was about a specific problem with specific assumptions. Here, the problem is more general. Let me check the original problem again:\n\nOriginal question:\nTitle: Can an irrational number raised to an irrational power be rational?\nQuestion: Can an irrational number raised to an irrational power be rational? If it can be rational, how can one prove it?\n\nSo the problem is to determine if such a case exists and if so, prove it. So the problem statement would be: \"Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\" But the original question is phrased as a yes/no question. However, the answer to this is yes, and the proof is classic, usually using sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) or considering e and ln(2), etc.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here are that a and b are irrational, and the problem is to prove whether their exponentiation can yield a rational number. So, following the example's format, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem.\n\nWait, but in this problem, there are no specific conditions given. The question is general. The example had specific conditions (n is integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem is to prove existence, given that a and b are irrational.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve whether a^b can be rational. If yes, provide a proof.\n\nBut the user's example formatted the problem as a statement to prove. In this case, since the original problem is a question, perhaps the problem should be phrased as: \"Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the user's example took the original question and rephrased it into a \"Prove that...\" statement, maybe we need to do the same here. The original question is \"Can X happen? If so, prove it.\" So the problem would be \"Prove that an irrational number raised to an irrational power can be rational.\"\n\nBut in the example, they had an original problem which was a \"Prove that...\" question, and they rephrased it by extracting assumptions. Here, the original problem is a yes/no question with a request for proof. So the formatted problem should be \"Prove whether an irrational number raised to an irrational power can be rational.\" But the answer is yes, so maybe it's better to state it as \"Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\"\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the example's structure, which took the original problem and structured it into assumptions and problem. The original example had the problem to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is integer and divisible by 7. So here, the problem is to prove that there exist irrational a and b such that a^b is rational, with assumptions being that a and b are irrational.\n\nBut the problem doesn't have any additional conditions. The assumptions are just that a and b are irrational. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^b can be rational.\n\nBut the problem is to show existence. So maybe the problem is better phrased as \"Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\"\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^b can be rational.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about whether it's possible, maybe:\n\nProblem:\nProve whether an irrational number raised to an irrational power can be rational. If yes, provide a proof.\n\nBut the example used a direct statement. So I think following the example's structure, it would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^b can be rational.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. So maybe here, the problem is not assuming that both a and b are irrational, but rather the problem is to find if such a and b exist. Therefore, the assumptions may not be explicitly listed, but the problem is to consider the case where a and b are both irrational. However, according to the user's instruction, the assumptions should list all the conditions. Since the question is about \"Can an irrational number raised to an irrational power be rational?\", the conditions are that both the base and the exponent are irrational. Hence, the assumptions would be those two conditions, each on their own line.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^b can be rational.\n\nBut the classic proof uses either a = sqrt(2), b = sqrt(2), then a^b is either rational or not, and if not, take a = sqrt(2)^sqrt(2), b = sqrt(2). So perhaps the problem is to prove existence. Hence, the problem statement should be \"Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\"\n\nTherefore, to make it precise, maybe the problem part should be:\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\n\nBut the original question is \"Can an irrational number raised to an irrational power be rational? If it can be rational, how can one prove it?\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture both parts: the question of possibility and the proof. However, according to the example, the problem is stated as a directive. So perhaps combining both into a problem statement: \"Prove whether an irrational number raised to an irrational power can be rational, and if so, provide a proof.\"\n\nBut I need to check how the user's example was structured. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem restated that. Here, the original problem is a question, so maybe the formatted problem is as is, but the user wants it structured into assumptions and problem.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem's assumptions are that a and b are irrational. The problem is to prove that their exponentiation can be rational. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^b can be rational.\n\nBut since the problem is about existence, maybe it's better to phrase it as existence. However, the original question is phrased generally. Let me verify the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user formatted the problem as \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91\" with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like the user made a mistake. Because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the user provided an incorrect example? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the example in the user's instruction is:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because if n is divisible by 7, then proving divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13) might be easier. But the original problem was for all integers n. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe I should not rely too much on the example's correctness.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the task is to list all the assumptions of the problem, each on one line, applied to one object. So in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The base is an irrational number.\n- The exponent is an irrational number.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^b can be rational.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about existence:\n\nAssumption:\nThere exists an irrational number a,\nThere exists an irrational number b.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^b is rational.\n\nBut the original question is not assuming existence, but asking if it's possible. So the problem is to prove or disprove the existence. The classic proof shows that such numbers exist. So the problem should be to prove that there exist irrational a and b such that a^b is rational.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they restated the problem, possibly altering the original assumptions. However, given the user's example might be incorrect, I should focus on their instructions: list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem.\n\nIn the original problem, the conditions are that a and b are irrational. So each of these is an assumption. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a^b can be rational.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under these assumptions (both a and b irrational), a^b can sometimes be rational. Therefore, the answer should be structured as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \na is an irrational number,\nb is an irrational number.\nProblem: \nProve that a^b can be rational.\n###",
