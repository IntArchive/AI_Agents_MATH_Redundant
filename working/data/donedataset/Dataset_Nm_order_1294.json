    "Content": "I am being asked to prove that $$\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n}\\cos(kx)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\sin(\\frac{2n+1}{2}x)}{2\\sin(x/2)}$$ I have some progress made, but I am stuck and could use some help. What I did: It holds that $$\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n}\\cos(kx)=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n}Re(\\cos(kx))=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n}Re(\\cos(x)^{k})=Re(\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n}\\cos(x)^{k})=Re\\left(\\cos(0)\\cdot\\frac{\\cos(x)^{n}-1}{\\cos(x)-1}\\right)=Re\\left(\\frac{\\cos(x)^{n}-1}{\\cos(x)-1}\\right)\n$$ For any $z_{1},z_{2}\\in\\mathbb{C}$ we have it that if $z_{1}=a+bi,z_{2}=c+di$ then $$\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}=\\frac{z_{1}\\overline{z2}}{|z_{2}|^{2}}=\\frac{(a+bi)(c-di)}{|z_{2}|^{2}}=\\frac{ac-bd+i(bc-ad)}{|z_{2}|^{2}}$$ hence $$Re\\left(\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}\\right)=\\frac{Re(z_{1})Re(z_{2})-Im(z_{1})Im(z_{2})}{|z_{2}|^{2}}$$ Thus, $$Re\\left(\\frac{\\cos(x)^{n}-1}{\\cos(x)-1}\\right)=\\frac{(\\cos(nx)-1)(\\cos(x)-1)-\\sin(nx)\\sin(x)}{(\\cos(x)-1)^{2}+\\sin^{2}(x)}=\\frac{\\cos(nx)\\cos(x)-\\cos(nx)-\\cos(x)+1-\\sin(nx)\\sin(x)}{\\cos^{2}(x)-2\\cos(x)+1+\\sin^{2}(x)}=\\frac{\\cos(nx)\\cos(x)-\\cos(nx)-\\cos(x)+1-\\sin(nx)\\sin(x)}{-2\\cos(x)+2}=\\frac{\\cos(nx)\\cos(x)-\\cos(nx)-\\cos(x)+1-\\sin(nx)\\sin(x)}{-2(\\cos(x)-1)}=\n\\frac{=\\cos(nx)\\cos(x)-\\cos(nx)-\\cos(x)+1-\\sin(nx)\\sin(x)}{-2(-2\\cdot\\sin^{2}(x/2))}=\\frac{\\cos(nx)\\cos(x)-\\cos(nx)-\\cos(x)+1-\\sin(nx)\\sin(x)}{4\\sin^{2}(x/2)}=\\frac{\\cos(nx)\\cos(x)-\\cos(nx)-\\cos(x)+1-\\sin(nx)\\sin(x)}{4\\sin^{2}(x/2)}=\\frac{\\cos(x(n+1))-\\cos(nx)-\\cos(x)+1}{4\\sin^{2}(x/2)}\n$$ This is the part where I am stuck, I would appriciate any help or hint on how to continue. Edit: Given the corrections by André I get: $$(\\cos(nx+x)-1)(\\cos(x)-1)+\\sin(nx+x)\\sin(x)=\\cos(nx+x)\\cos(x)-\\cos(nx)-\\cos(x)+1+\\sin(nx+x)\\sin(x)$$ so $$\\cos(nx+x)\\cos(x)+\\sin(nx+x)\\sin(x)=\\cos(xn+x-x)-\\cos(nx)=0$$ Edit 2: I found anoter mistake in the above, I will try to correct Edit 3: When multiplying correctly the above it works out :-)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are faster ways to go, but if you want to continue along the path you have taken, you are quite close to the end. Please see the remark for a couple of small things that need to be corrected in the calculation.  Essentially the same trigonometric tricks continue to work. By a double angle formula for the cosine, we have \n$$\\cos x=1-2\\sin^2(x/2),$$ so \n$$\\frac{1-\\cos x}{4\\sin^2(x/2)}=\\frac{1}{2},$$ part of what you are aiming for. However, this could have been obtained in a simpler way in the third displayed formula after the \"Thus,\" in the OP. And the front part will \"simplify\" by a difference of $\\cos$ formula, obtained from $$\\cos(a+b)=\\cos a\\cos b-\\sin a\\sin b,\\qquad \\cos(a-b)=\\cos a\\cos b+\\sin a\\sin b.$$ Subtract. We get \n$$\\cos(a+b)-\\cos(a-b)=-2\\sin a\\sin b.$$\nLet $a+b=x(n+1)$, and $a-b=nx$. So $a=\\dfrac{x(2n+1)}{2}$ and $b=\\dfrac{x}{2}$. Remark: There is a little sign glitch in the calculation of $(a+bi)(c-di)$. Note that the real part should be $ac+bd$. Also, when you are summing the geometric progression, we need $\\text{cis}^{n+1}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking to prove the finite sum of cos(kx) from k=0 to n equals 1/2 plus [sin((2n+1)x/2)] divided by [2 sin(x/2)]. They mentioned they've made some progress using complex numbers and taking real parts but got stuck. They tried expanding using trigonometric identities and ended up with a complicated expression. Then through edits, they corrected some mistakes and eventually found that multiplying correctly works out, so they might have solved it.\n\nBut according to the task, I need to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. The example given had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, looking at the problem: sum from k=0 to n of cos(kx). The formula to prove is given, so assumptions would be any conditions on variables. The original problem doesn't specify any restrictions on x or n, except perhaps that x is a real number and n is a non-negative integer? Because k starts at 0 to n, n should be an integer >=0. Also, the denominator has sin(x/2), so sin(x/2) can't be zero, meaning x/2 ≠ mπ, so x ≠ 2mπ for integer m. So that's a condition to ensure the denominator isn't zero.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- x is a real number.\n- x ≠ 2mπ for any integer m.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the title and the initial question doesn't mention these restrictions. However, in the process, the user uses complex numbers and real parts, but the main formula is standard for the sum of cosines. The formula is valid as long as sin(x/2) ≠ 0, so x not a multiple of 2π. So that's an implicit assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- x is a real number such that sin(x/2) ≠ 0.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So in this case, n is a non-negative integer (since k goes from 0 to n), x is a real number, and x ≠ 2πm for any integer m. However, the user might not have specified x ≠ 2πm in their original problem, but the formula provided has sin(x/2) in the denominator, so it's necessary. Therefore, the problem assumes these conditions even if not explicitly stated. So to structure the problem correctly, I need to list these assumptions.\n\nLooking at the original problem statement again: \"Prove that ∑ₖ₌₀ⁿ cos(kx) = 1/2 + sin[(2n+1)x/2]/(2 sin(x/2))\". The user didn't mention x being not a multiple of 2π, but it's required for the formula to hold. So we have to include that as an assumption. Also, n being a non-negative integer, as the sum is from 0 to n.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- x is a real number.\n- x is not an integer multiple of 2π.\n\nEach assumption on a separate line. Then the problem is to prove the given sum equals the formula.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nx is a real number,\nx is not an integer multiple of 2π.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n}\\cos(kx)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{2n+1}{2}x\\right)}{2\\sin(x/2)}.$$\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in their original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the example added \"divisible by 7\" which was part of the problem. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the user had n divisible by 7 as an assumption? Wait, no, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Or maybe the user had another assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the original problem had an error, but in the formatted version, the assistant added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the example is from a different problem where the user might have had additional constraints. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Anyway, in the current problem, we need to make sure our assumptions are correct.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to prove the sum equals the formula. The standard formula for the sum of cos(kx) from k=0 to n is indeed [sin((n+1)x/2) / sin(x/2)] * cos(nx/2). But the given formula here is 1/2 + [sin((2n+1)x/2)] / [2 sin(x/2)]. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the formula to prove is 1/2 plus sin((2n+1)x/2) divided by (2 sin(x/2)). Let me see. If we take the standard formula:\n\nSum_{k=0}^n cos(kx) = [sin((n+1)x/2) * cos(nx/2)] / sin(x/2)\n\nBut maybe through manipulation, this can be rewritten as 1/2 + sin((2n+1)x/2)/(2 sin(x/2)). Let me check for n=0: sum is cos(0) =1. The formula gives 1/2 + sin(x/2)/(2 sin(x/2)) = 1/2 + 1/2 =1. Correct. For n=1: cos(0)+cos(x)=1+cos(x). The formula: 1/2 + sin(3x/2)/(2 sin(x/2)). Let's compute sin(3x/2)/(2 sin(x/2)) using identity: sin(3x/2) = sin(x + x/2) = sinx cos(x/2) + cosx sin(x/2). Then divide by 2 sin(x/2): [sinx cos(x/2) + cosx sin(x/2)] / [2 sin(x/2)] = [sinx cot(x/2) + cosx]/2. Not sure if that equals 1 + cosx -1/2. Wait, original sum is 1 + cosx. Formula: 1/2 + [sin(3x/2)]/[2 sin(x/2)]. Let's compute:\n\nsin(3x/2) = sin(x + x/2) = sinx cos(x/2) + cosx sin(x/2). Divide by 2 sin(x/2):\n\n[sinx cos(x/2) + cosx sin(x/2)] / [2 sin(x/2)] = [sinx cos(x/2)/(2 sin(x/2))] + cosx/2.\n\nNote that sinx / sin(x/2) = 2 cos(x/2), so first term is [2 cos(x/2) * cos(x/2)] / 2 = cos²(x/2). So total becomes cos²(x/2) + cosx/2. Using identity cosx = 2cos²(x/2) -1, so cos²(x/2) = (1 + cosx)/2. Thus, first term is (1 + cosx)/2, second term is cosx/2. Total: (1 + cosx)/2 + cosx/2 = 1/2 + cosx/2 + cosx/2 = 1/2 + cosx. So indeed, 1/2 + [sin(3x/2)/(2 sin(x/2))] = 1/2 + (1 + cosx)/2 + cosx/2? Wait, no. Wait, we have [sin(3x/2)/(2 sin(x/2))] = [ (1 + cosx)/2 + cosx/2 ]? Wait, no, according to the calculation above, it's [sinx cos(x/2) + cosx sin(x/2)] / [2 sin(x/2))] = cos²(x/2) + cosx/2. Then the formula 1/2 + that becomes 1/2 + cos²(x/2) + cosx/2. But cos²(x/2) is (1 + cosx)/2, so substituting gives 1/2 + (1 + cosx)/2 + cosx/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 + cosx/2 + cosx/2 = 1 + cosx, which matches the sum. So the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula holds when sin(x/2) ≠ 0, i.e., x ≠ 2πm. So the assumptions are as I listed before. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those assumptions.",
