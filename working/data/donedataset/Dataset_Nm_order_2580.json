    "Content": "Here is the statement of the Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev theorem. Let $0< \\alpha< n$, $1 < p < q < \\infty$ and $\\frac{1}{q}=\\frac{1}{p}-\\frac{\\alpha}{n}$. Then:\n$$ \\left \\| \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\frac{f(y)dy}{|x-y|^{n-\\alpha} } \\right\\|_{L^q(\\mathbb{R}^n)}\\leq C\\left\\| f\\right\\| _{L^p(\\mathbb{R^n})}.$$ I know two proofs of this theorem. The first one (I think the standard one) uses the Marcinckiewicz interpolation theorem . The second one uses the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function and its boundedness from $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. To prove this boundedness I need the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem again. (Even if it's enough the \"diagonal\" version.) My question is: is there a proof of the above theorem that doesn't use Marcinkiewicz? Is this interpolation theorem necessary in order to prove HLS?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a direct and self-contained proof of HLS inequality in Analysis by Lieb and Loss , Theorem 4.3.  It uses nothing but layer cake representation , Hölder's inequality, and clever manipulation of integrals. A bit too long to reproduce here, though. Also, the boundedness of Hardy-Littlewood maximal function is much more straightforward than the general Marcinkiewicz  interpolation theorem; it is presented in the textbooks as a consequence of the latter just because the authors would like it to be one. Stein  proves it as Theorem 1.1.1 in Singular integrals and differentiability properties of functions . First,  the covering lemma is used to prove the weak $(1,1)$ inequality \n$$m(E_\\alpha)\\le C\\alpha^{-1}\\int_{\\mathbb R^n} |f(x)|\\,dx \\tag{1}$$\nwhere $E_\\alpha = \\{x:Mf(x)>\\alpha\\}$. Fix $\\alpha$ and let $f_1=f\\chi_{|f|\\ge \\alpha/2}$. Since $|f|\\le f_1+\\alpha/2$, it follows that \n$$\\{x:Mf(x)>\\alpha\\}\\subset \\{x:Mf_1(x)>\\alpha/2\\}$$\nApply $(1)$ and use the layercake representation of $\\int (Mf)^p$: \n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb R^n} (Mf(x))^p\\,dx = p\\int_0^\\infty \\alpha^{p-1} m(E_\\alpha)\\,d\\alpha \\le \np \\int_0^\\infty \\alpha^{p-1} \\frac{C}{\\alpha}\\left( \\int_{|f|>\\alpha/2}|f(x)|\\,dx\\right)\\,d\\alpha\n$$\nSwitch the order of integration on the right to get \n$$\nC p \\int_{\\mathbb R^n}|f(x)|\\,dx \\int_0^{2|f(x)|} \\alpha^{p-2} \\,d\\alpha\n= C'\\int_{\\mathbb R^n}|f(x)|^p\\,dx \n$$\nas desired. And now that I typed all this, I see that the Wikipedia article Hardy–Littlewood maximal function also gives this proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition line by line, addressing one property per object. Then the problem is restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question from Math Stack Exchange: The user is asking about the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality and whether its proof requires Marcinkiewicz interpolation. They mention that they know two proofs, both using Marcinkiewicz, either directly or via the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. The main question is if there's a proof without using that interpolation theorem.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem statement. The theorem statement includes parameters 0 < α < n, 1 < p < q < ∞, and the relation 1/q = 1/p - α/n. These are the conditions given. Each of these should be listed as separate assumptions. The problem then is to prove the inequality given these conditions, and the user is specifically asking if it can be done without Marcinkiewicz interpolation.\n\nWait, the problem as presented in the original question is about the necessity of Marcinkiewicz. But in the format example, the problem is to \"Prove that...\". Here, the problem is more of a meta-question: whether the theorem can be proven without a specific method. So how to structure that?\n\nLooking at the example: The original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and in the formatted version, the problem is restated as such, with the assumptions. Here, the user is asking if the HLS theorem can be proven without Marcinkiewicz. So the assumptions are the conditions of the theorem (parameters and relation), and the problem is whether there's a proof avoiding Marcinkiewicz.\n\nBut the example's problem starts with \"Prove that...\", while here it's a question about the necessity of a method. The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which includes listing assumptions and then the problem. So perhaps in this case, the problem part is the question: \"Is the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem necessary to prove the HLS inequality?\" or \"Can the HLS inequality be proven without using Marcinkiewicz interpolation?\"\n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are only the mathematical conditions given in the theorem, not the methods of proof. The original theorem's assumptions are the ranges for α, n, p, q, and their relationship. The problem then is whether Marcinkiewicz is necessary for the proof.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n- 0 < α < n\n- 1 < p < q < ∞\n- 1/q = 1/p - α/n\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is the user's question about the proof method. So the formatted problem should present these assumptions and then state the question.\n\nSo following the format:\n\nAssumption:\n0 < α < n,\n1 < p < q < ∞,\n1/q = 1/p - α/n.\n\nProblem:\nIs there a proof of the Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev inequality that does not use the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem? Is the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem necessary to prove this inequality?\n\nBut the original problem also states the inequality itself. Should that be included in the problem statement? In the example, the problem includes the expression to be proven. So here, the problem is to prove the inequality under the given assumptions, but the actual question is about the method. Hmm. The user's original problem is not to prove the inequality but to ask about the necessity of Marcinkiewicz in its proof. However, the example given by the user was about proving a divisibility statement. So perhaps the problem here should be phrased as \"Prove that [inequality] holds without using Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem?\" But the original question is not to prove it, but to ask if such a proof exists. Wait, the user's exact question is: \"is there a proof of the above theorem that doesn't use Marcinkiewicz? Is this interpolation theorem necessary in order to prove HLS?\"\n\nTherefore, the problem part should reflect that. However, the example had the problem as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps here, the problem is the two questions: existence of a proof without Marcinkiewicz and necessity of the theorem. But the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". Maybe the problem is to determine if Marcinkiewicz is necessary, given the assumptions. But how to phrase that concisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the HLS inequality without Marcinkiewicz, given the assumptions, and the question is whether that's possible, hence the problem is asking for a proof that avoids Marcinkiewicz. But the original question is not to actually provide the proof but to inquire if such a proof exists. However, in the example, the problem was to prove something. So maybe in this case, the problem is as stated in the theorem, and the original question is about the method. But the user wants to structure the problem as per the theorem's statement, with assumptions, and then the problem being to prove it. But the actual question on MSE is about the method of proof.\n\nWait, maybe the user is asking to format the theorem's problem, not the meta-question. Let me check again. The original question starts by stating the theorem, then mentions that proofs use Marcinkiewicz, and asks if there's a proof without it. So the problem here is the theorem itself (the inequality), and the user's question is about the method of proof. However, the format example takes the problem (prove divisibility) and lists assumptions. So perhaps the problem part here is the inequality, and the user's actual question is an additional part. But according to the user's instructions, the task is to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which in the example includes the theorem's assumptions and the problem to prove it. However, in this case, the user's question is about the method of proof. So maybe the problem should be the theorem's statement, and the original question's inquiry about Marcinkiewicz is part of the context, but the structured problem should focus on the theorem's conditions and the inequality. But the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem, but added in the formatted version. Wait, no: looking back, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" (which was in the original) and \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. Wait, that's incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original example's problem is to prove divisibility by 91. The user's formatted version lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. So perhaps there was an error in the example. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem? Wait, the user might have provided an incorrect example. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then adding \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption would make the problem different. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user mistyped. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But the user's example's original problem states \"for every integer n\", which conflicts with the formatted assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. So perhaps the example is wrong, but the user wants the answer to follow that format regardless.\n\nIn any case, the task is to process the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The given question is about the HLS inequality and whether its proof requires Marcinkiewicz interpolation. The theorem's conditions are 0 < α < n, 1 < p < q < ∞, and 1/q = 1/p - α/n. The problem is to prove the inequality, and the user is asking if it can be done without Marcinkiewicz.\n\nBut the format requires the assumptions and the problem. So the assumptions would be the mathematical conditions given in the theorem, and the problem is to prove the inequality. However, the user's actual question is about the method of proof, which is meta. But according to the example, the problem is the mathematical statement to prove. So perhaps the problem here is the inequality, and the user's actual question (whether Marcinkiewicz is necessary) is beyond the format. But the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which in the example takes the original problem (prove divisibility) and structures it with assumptions and problem. Therefore, in this case, the problem should be the HLS inequality statement, with the assumptions listed, and the problem being to prove it. However, the original question is about the method, but the format seems to focus on the mathematical problem itself. So the user might have intended to extract the mathematical problem from the MSE question, list its assumptions, and present the problem as proving the inequality, but the actual MSE question is whether that can be done without Marcinkiewicz. So perhaps there's a confusion here.\n\nWait, maybe the user wants to extract the mathematical problem (the HLS inequality) from the MSE question and present it in the format, while the actual MSE question is about the proof method. But the user's example included an original problem (prove divisibility) and formatted it into assumptions and problem. Similarly, here, the original MSE question states the HLS theorem as part of the question, so we need to extract that theorem's conditions as assumptions and the inequality as the problem. Then, the actual question (about Marcinkiewicz) is separate. But according to the user's instructions, the task is to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps the \"problem\" part is the HLS inequality to prove, and the question about Marcinkiewicz is considered unrelated information to be filtered out. But in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was the same, with added assumptions. Wait, no, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Unless the example had a different original problem. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is correct, and the user made a mistake. If the original problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted version, it's under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, then that's changing the problem. So perhaps the example is flawed. But regardless, the task is to follow the format as described, even if the example is incorrect.\n\nIn the given MSE question, the user provides the statement of the HLS theorem, which has certain conditions (0 < α < n, 1 < p < q < ∞, 1/q = 1/p - α/n), and then asks if there's a proof without Marcinkiewicz. The task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The \"unrelated information\" here might be the discussion about the proofs the user knows and their use of Marcinkiewicz. So the core mathematical problem is the HLS inequality under the given conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions (the parameters) and the problem is to prove the inequality. However, the original question is actually about the method of proof. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut according to the user's example, even if the original problem was about proving for every integer n, the formatted version added an assumption (n divisible by 7), which changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example was from a different problem where such an assumption was present. But regardless, following the user's instruction, we need to structure the given MSE question into assumptions and problem, filtering out unrelated info.\n\nIn the MSE question, the theorem's assumptions are 0 < α < n, 1 < p < q < ∞, 1/q = 1/p - α/n. The problem is to prove the inequality ||...|| <= C||f||_p. The user's actual question is about the proof method, but according to the format, we need to present the mathematical problem, not the meta-question. So the formatted problem would be the HLS inequality with those assumptions, and the problem is to prove it. However, the user's question is whether Marcinkiewicz is necessary. But the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), so perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove the HLS inequality under the given assumptions, and the original question's inquiry about the proof method is considered separate. But according to the user's instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which focused on the mathematical problem, not the meta-question. Therefore, the formatted problem here would be:\n\nAssumption:\n0 < α < n,\n1 < p < q < ∞,\n1/q = 1/p - α/n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$ \\left \\| \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\frac{f(y)dy}{|x-y|^{n-\\alpha} } \\right\\|_{L^q(\\mathbb{R}^n)}\\leq C\\left\\| f\\right\\| _{L^p(\\mathbb{R^n})}. $$\n\nHowever, the original MSE question is not asking to prove it, but whether a certain method can be avoided. But the user's example took the original problem (prove divisibility) and structured it, even though the formatted version had an extra assumption. This is confusing. Maybe the user wants to extract the theorem's conditions as assumptions and present the problem as proving the inequality, regardless of the actual question's focus on proof methods. Therefore, despite the MSE question being about the proof method, the formatted problem is about proving the inequality under the given assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual problem to structure is the question itself: \"Is the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem necessary to prove the HLS inequality?\" But then the assumptions would be the theorem's conditions. But the example structured a problem to prove something, not a yes/no question.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Given the example, which structures a problem to prove something with assumptions, perhaps the intended format is to present the theorem as a problem to prove, with its assumptions. The original MSE question includes that theorem statement, so the formatted problem would be that theorem. The user's actual question (about Marcinkiewicz) is then additional context but filtered out as unrelated. Therefore, the final answer should list the theorem's assumptions and present the problem as proving the inequality.",
