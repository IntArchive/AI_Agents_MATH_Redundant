    "Content": "I am trying to show that $X^n-Y^m$ is irreducible in $\\Bbb{C}[X,Y]$ iff $\\gcd(n,m)=1$ where $n,m$ are positive integers. I showed that if $\\gcd(n,m)$ is not $1$, then $X^n-Y^m$ is reducible. How to show the other direction. Please help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Lemma: If $f \\in \\mathbb{C}[X,Y]$ is irreducible polynomial over $\\mathbb{C}(Y)$, then  its factorization in $\\mathbb{C}[X,Y]$ consists of an irreducible polynomial and zero or more univariate polynomials in $Y$. Theorem: If $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$, then $S^m - T^n$ is an irreducible polynomial in one variable ($S$) over the field $K = \\mathbb{C}(T)$. Proof: The $m$ distinct roots of this polynomial are the values $\\zeta^k T^{n/m}$ lying in the field $L = \\mathbb{C}(T^{1/m})$, where $\\zeta$ is a primitive $m$-th root of unity. We can find $a,b$ so that $am + bn = 1$. This implies $$ T^a \\left(T^{n/m} \\right)^b = T^{(am + bn)/m} = T^{1/m}$$ and so $L = K(T^{n/m})$. There are a number of ways to infer that $S^m - T^n$ is irreducible from this; e.g. $[L:K] = m$ along with the fact $S^m - T^n$ is degree $m$ mean that $S^m - T^n$ is the minimal polynomial of $T^{n/m}$ over $K$. $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, looking at the original question: The title is \"X^n - Y^m is irreducible in ℂ[X,Y] iff gcd(n,m)=1\". The user is asking for help proving the other direction, having already shown that if gcd(n,m) ≠ 1, then the polynomial is reducible.\n\nSo, the main goal is to prove that X^n - Y^m is irreducible over the complex numbers if and only if the greatest common divisor of n and m is 1. The user has done one direction (gcd not 1 implies reducible) and needs the converse (gcd 1 implies irreducible).\n\nNow, applying the format. The example given includes assumptions that list each condition on the objects. Here, the problem involves polynomials in two variables over the complex numbers. The key assumptions would be about the exponents n and m, their gcd, and the polynomial ring being over ℂ.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"iff gcd(n,m)=1\". So the assumptions should include that n and m are positive integers, and the polynomial is in ℂ[X,Y]. The problem then is to show irreducibility if and only if gcd(n,m)=1. However, the user has already shown one direction (if gcd isn't 1, reducible). But the formatted problem in the example only includes necessary assumptions for the problem as stated. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the given problem here, the user is focusing on the other direction.\n\nWait, the example might have been specific to that problem. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, maybe the example was incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, the formatted problem should list all assumptions. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Wait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, we should filter unrelated information and list assumptions. So perhaps in that example, there was a mistake in the original problem, and the correct problem required n divisible by 7. But I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem: The user wants to show X^n - Y^m is irreducible in ℂ[X,Y] iff gcd(n,m)=1. The user has already handled the case where gcd(n,m) ≠ 1, and now needs the converse. So in structuring the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n and m are positive integers.\n- The polynomial is in ℂ[X,Y].\n- gcd(n,m) = 1 (for the direction they need help with).\n\nBut the problem statement is to show the equivalence (iff), but the user is specifically asking for the other direction. Wait, the original question says \"iff gcd(n,m)=1\", and the user has shown that if gcd is not 1, it's reducible. Now they need to show that if gcd is 1, then it's irreducible. So the problem as stated is to prove the equivalence. However, in the example, the formatted problem might focus on the part the user is struggling with. But according to the user's instruction, the formatted problem should structure the original problem as given. The example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, perhaps because the original problem had that, but maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a correction. Maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version fixed it. But in our current case, the problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange is correct.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that X^n - Y^m is irreducible in ℂ[X,Y] if and only if gcd(n,m)=1. The user has already done one direction and needs the other. But for the formatted problem, we need to present the entire problem as given, listing all assumptions. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- n and m are positive integers.\n- The polynomial X^n - Y^m is considered in the ring ℂ[X,Y].\n- gcd(n,m) = 1 (for the \"if\" direction, but the problem is an iff).\n\nWait, but the problem is an equivalence. So the assumptions would include the conditions for both directions. But the example structured the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect. But perhaps in the original example, there was a mistake, and the correct problem required n divisible by 7. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include the assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state it. This is confusing.\n\nBut following the user's instruction: \"filter the unrelated information and structure that problem as the following format\". The example seems to have taken the original problem and added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original, perhaps because the original had an error. But in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions from the original problem. The original problem states that n and m are positive integers, and the polynomial is in ℂ[X,Y]. The problem is to show irreducibility iff gcd(n,m)=1. So the assumptions are:\n\n- n and m are positive integers.\n- The polynomial is in ℂ[X,Y].\n\nThe problem is to prove that X^n - Y^m is irreducible in ℂ[X,Y] if and only if gcd(n,m)=1.\n\nBut the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), so perhaps the user wants us to extract implicit assumptions. Wait, in the original problem from the example, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the correct assumption was that n is divisible by 7. But how do we know? Maybe the answer required divisibility by 7 and 13 (since 91=7*13), so the original problem might have intended n to be any integer, but the divisibility by 91 holds for all n, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem was to show that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 7. This is unclear.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question is correct. So, for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- n and m are positive integers.\n- The polynomial is in ℂ[X,Y].\n\nThe problem is to prove that X^n - Y^m is irreducible in ℂ[X,Y] if and only if gcd(n,m)=1.\n\nBut the example's formatting included specific assumptions about the problem. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This seems contradictory. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user wants us to structure the current problem as per the format.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- m is a positive integer.\n- The polynomial X^n - Y^m is considered in the ring ℂ[X,Y].\n\nProblem:\nProve that X^n - Y^m is irreducible in ℂ[X,Y] if and only if gcd(n, m) = 1.\n\nBut the user's example split assumptions into one per line, each addressing one property. So each assumption should be a separate line. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nm is a positive integer,\nX^n - Y^m is in the ring ℂ[X,Y],\ngcd(n, m) = 1.\n\nWait, but the problem is an if and only if. So the gcd condition is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are the basic conditions needed for the problem, not the hypotheses of the equivalence.\n\nThe problem is to prove that under the assumptions that n and m are positive integers and the polynomial is in ℂ[X,Y], the polynomial X^n - Y^m is irreducible if and only if gcd(n,m)=1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list the basic conditions given in the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nm is a positive integer,\nX^n - Y^m is a polynomial in ℂ[X,Y].\n\nProblem:\nProve that X^n - Y^m is irreducible in ℂ[X,Y] if and only if gcd(n, m) = 1.\n\nYes, this seems correct. The gcd condition is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The assumptions are the given conditions about n, m, and the polynomial's ring.",
