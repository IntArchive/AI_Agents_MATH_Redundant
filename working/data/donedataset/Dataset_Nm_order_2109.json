    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your inequality says $\\left| \\int_0^\\pi e^{i\\phi(x)}\\ dx \\right| > 2$.  In fact if $|\\phi'| < 1$ we have $|\\phi(x) - \\phi(\\pi/2)| < |x - \\pi/2|$ for $0 < x < \\pi$, so \n$$\\left| \\int_0^\\pi e^{i\\phi(x)}\\ dx \\right| \\ge \\text{Re}\\ e^{-i \\phi(\\pi/2)} \\int_0^\\pi e^{i \\phi(x)}\\ dx = \\int_0^\\pi \\cos(\\phi(x)-\\phi(\\pi/2))\\ dx > \\int_0^\\pi \\cos(x - \\pi/2)\\ dx  = 2$$\nHere I'm using the facts that $\\cos$ is even and is decreasing on $[0,\\pi]$.  No smoothness of $\\phi$ is necessary, just differentiability. More generally, if you replaced $|\\phi'| < 1$ by $|\\phi'| < k$ where $0 < k < 2$, the inequality would become $$\\left|\\int_0^\\pi e^{i\\phi(x)}\\ dx \\right| > \\frac{2}{k} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k \\pi}{2}\\right)$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe question is titled \"Simple but difficult to prove inequality involving integrals.\" The user wants to prove that for any smooth function φ: R → R with the derivative's absolute value less than 1 for all x in (0, π), the sum of the squares of the integrals of cos(φ(x)) and sin(φ(x)) over 0 to π is greater than 4.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The problem states \"any smooth function φ: R → R\" which means φ is smooth (infinitely differentiable) and maps real numbers to real numbers. Then, there's the condition on the derivative: |dφ/dx| < 1 for all x in (0, π). So, each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object.\n\nLet me list the assumptions:\n\n1. φ is a smooth function from R to R. (So φ: R → R and smooth.)\n2. The absolute value of the derivative of φ, |dφ/dx|, is less than 1 for all x in (0, π). \n\nWait, does the problem mention anything else? The domain for x is (0, π), but when integrating, it's from 0 to π. The problem doesn't specify any conditions at the endpoints x=0 or x=π, just the derivative condition in the open interval (0, π). Also, the function is defined on R, but the integral is from 0 to π. So φ needs to be smooth on R, but the condition on the derivative is only required on (0, π). \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- φ: R → R is smooth.\n- |dφ/dx| < 1 for all x in (0, π).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each addressing one property of one object (φ here). The problem then is to prove the inequality involving the integrals.\n\nNow, checking the example provided: the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the user split them into two separate assumptions. Similarly, here, the two conditions on φ are separate assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is a smooth function from ℝ to ℝ,\n|dφ/dx| < 1 for all x in (0, π).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\left(\\int_0^\\pi \\cos(\\phi(x)) \\; dx\\right)^2 + \\left(\\int_0^\\pi \\sin(\\phi(x))\\;dx\\right)^2 > 4.$$\n\nI need to make sure there are no other implicit assumptions. The problem states \"for any smooth function φ,\" so there's no restriction on φ's values at 0 or π, just that it's smooth everywhere and the derivative is bounded in (0, π). Also, the problem uses the term \"smooth,\" which typically means C^∞, but sometimes in some contexts it might mean just continuously differentiable. However, since the problem specifies \"smooth,\" I should stick to that term as given.\n\nSo, I think that's all. The two assumptions are clear and separate, and the problem statement is correctly rephrased.",
