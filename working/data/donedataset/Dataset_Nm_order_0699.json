    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a nice solution from R. Tauraso , for those interested in this problem: Solution proposed by Roberto Tauraso, Roma, Italy. The Multiple Harmonic Sum is defined by $$H_{n}(s_{1}, \\dots, s_{l}) == \\sum_{0 < k_{1} < k_{2} < \\dots < k_{l} \\leq n}\\prod_{i = 1}^{l}\\frac{1}{k_{i}^{s_{i}}}$$ Then, by the known properties of the stuffle product,\n\\begin{align}\nH_{n}^{2}(1) &= 2H_{n}(1, 1) + H_{n}(2)\\notag\\\\\nH_{n}^{3}(1) &= 6H_{n}(1, 1, 1) + 3H_{n}(1, 2) + 3H_{n}(2, 1) + H_{n}(3)\\notag\n\\end{align}\nTherefore, for $N > 0$,\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\\frac{H_{n}^{2}}{n} &= 2\\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\\frac{H_{n}(1, 1)}{n} + \\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\\frac{H_{n}(2)}{n}\\notag\\\\\n&= 2H_{N}(1, 1, 1) + 2H_{N}(1, 2) + H_{N}(3) + H_{N}(2, 1)\\notag\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{3}H_{N}^{3}(1) + \\frac{2}{3}H_{N}(3) + H_{N}(1, 2)\\notag\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{3}H_{N}^{3}(1) + \\frac{2}{3}\\zeta(3) + \\zeta(2, 1) + o(1)\\notag\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{3}H_{N}^{3}(1) + \\frac{5}{3}\\zeta(3) + o(1)\\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\nbecause $\\zeta(2, 1) = \\zeta(3)$ (see for example Thirty-two Goldbach Variations by J.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the original problem here: the user is asking about a closed form of a series involving harmonic numbers, the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and Stieltjes constants. The proposition gives a specific sum equal to an expression involving ζ(3), γ, γ₁, γ₂. The question is asking for the tool to prove it.\n\nSo, first, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem defines several terms: H_n is the nth harmonic number, γ is the usual Euler-Mascheroni constant defined as the limit of H_n - ln n. Then γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants, which are defined here through specific limits involving sums of ln k /k and ln²k /k minus terms with logarithms squared and cubed. \n\nEach of these definitions should be separate assumptions. The problem is to prove the closed form of the given series. The original problem statement includes the series sum, the closed form expression, and definitions. The definitions of H_n, γ, γ₁, γ₂ are all assumptions here. The problem is then to prove the equality.\n\nSo breaking down the assumptions line by line, each definition is a separate assumption. Let me check:\n\nAssumption 1: H_n is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of 1/k. That's one line.\n\nAssumption 2: γ is the limit as n approaches infinity of (sum from k=1 to n 1/k - ln n). That's another.\n\nAssumption 3: γ₁ is the limit as n approaches infinity of (sum from k=1 to n (ln k)/k - (1/2)(ln n)^2). Third.\n\nAssumption 4: γ₂ is the limit as n approaches infinity of (sum from k=1 to n (ln²k)/k - (1/3)(ln n)^3). Fourth.\n\nThese are all separate conditions defining each object (H_n, γ, γ₁, γ₂). Then the problem is to prove the series equals the given expression. The question part is \"What tool would use to prove it?\" but the formatted problem in the example only states \"Prove that...\". However, in the example, the original problem's additional question (\"What tool...\") is not included in the formatted problem. Wait, looking at the example, the original problem had \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem just restates that as the problem. The question part here is \"What tool would use to prove it?\" but in the example, the user's formatted problem didn't include that. Wait, looking back, the example's original problem was \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem just says \"Prove that...\". The additional question here is \"What tool would use to prove it?\" which might be part of the problem statement. However, the format requires just the problem part. Let me check the instructions: \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example's formatted problem includes the problem statement, not the question. So in the example, the original problem's question was \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem is \"Prove that...\". Here, the original problem is a proposition of the closed form and then asks \"What tool would use to prove it?\" However, the user wants the problem structured into assumptions and problem. The problem part here should be the statement to prove, and the question about tools is part of the original problem, but maybe not part of the formatted problem. Wait, looking at the user's example, the original problem had \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". So the user's instruction is to structure the problem as assumptions and problem. The question part here is \"What tool would use to prove it?\" but in the example, the question was part of the problem statement. Wait, the example's original problem was \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem's problem section is \"Prove that...\". So perhaps in this case, the problem part is the proposition statement, and the question about the tool is an additional part. But according to the instructions, the assistant is supposed to structure the problem as Assumption and Problem. The example included in the problem shows that the original problem had \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\", with the assumptions being the conditions on n. Here, the original problem states a proposition (the equality of the series to the expression) and then asks \"What tool would use to prove it?\" But in the example, the formatted problem only includes the proposition to prove. Therefore, perhaps the problem part here is the proposition, and the question about the tools is part of the original question but not included in the formatted problem. So the formatted problem would be the proposition, and the assumptions are the definitions given. So the problem is to prove that the sum equals the given expression. The definitions (H_n, γ, γ₁, γ₂) are the assumptions. The Stieltjes constants part is mentioned, but γ₁ and γ₂ are defined here specifically, so those definitions are the assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions would be each of the definitions listed, each as a separate line. The problem is the equality of the series to the expression. Then, the original question \"What tool...\" is part of the original problem, but in the formatted version, perhaps it's omitted, following the example. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". Here, the original problem states the proposition and then asks \"What tool...\". But according to the user's instructions, the task is to \"structure that problem as the following format\" which includes Assumption and Problem. The example included the problem as \"Prove that...\". So in this case, the problem part should be the proposition to prove, and the question about the tool is part of the original problem but not included in the formatted version. So the formatted problem will have the problem as the proposition statement. Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions of H_n, γ, γ₁, γ₂. Each as separate lines. Then the problem is to prove the sum equals the expression. The user's original question in the problem is \"What tool would use to prove it?\" but in the formatted problem, that's not included. The example didn't include the \"how to prove\" part, just the statement to prove. Therefore, I need to structure the problem as the proposition to prove, with the assumptions being the definitions. So the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nH_n is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of 1/k,\nγ is the limit as n approaches infinity of (sum_{k=1}^n 1/k - ln n),\nγ₁ is the limit as n approaches infinity of (sum_{k=1}^n (ln k)/k - (1/2)(ln n)^2),\nγ₂ is the limit as n approaches infinity of (sum_{k=1}^n (ln²k)/k - (1/3)(ln n)^3),\nγ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{H_n^2-(\\gamma + \\ln n)^2}{n} = \\dfrac{5}{3}\\zeta(3)-\\dfrac{2}{3}\\gamma^3-2\\gamma \\gamma_{1}-\\gamma_{2}.$$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's stated that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants. However, the definitions given here for γ₁ and γ₂ are specific representations of them. Stieltjes constants are generally defined as coefficients in the Laurent expansion of the Riemann zeta function around s=1. But in this problem, they are defined through these specific limits. So perhaps the assumption should include that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants as defined by those limits. So each assumption is one line per definition, and the last line stating that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants. But maybe that's redundant, since the definitions already define them. Alternatively, perhaps it's an assumption that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants as per the given definitions. So the user provided the definitions, so each of those is an assumption. The problem then is to prove the equality. The mention that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants is additional information but perhaps not an assumption. Wait, the original problem says \"γ₁, γ₂ being Stieltjes constants\". So that's part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the assumption includes that they are Stieltjes constants. However, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions in the problem. Here, the problem defines the constants and states they are Stieltjes constants. So maybe the assumption is that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants as defined by those limits. Therefore, each definition is an assumption, and the last line is that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants. But since the problem already defines them, perhaps the fact that they are Stieltjes constants is part of the problem context, not an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps it's an assumption that those limits exist and are equal to the Stieltjes constants. Hmm. The example didn't have such meta assumptions. The user in the example just listed the mathematical conditions. Here, the problem provides definitions of H_n, γ, γ₁, γ₂, and mentions that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- H_n is defined as sum_{k=1}^n 1/k\n\n- γ is defined as the limit of (sum 1/k - ln n)\n\n- γ₁ is defined as the limit of (sum (ln k)/k - (1/2)(ln n)^2)\n\n- γ₂ is defined as the limit of (sum (ln²k)/k - (1/3)(ln n)^3)\n\n- γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants\n\nBut since the user wrote in the problem statement that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants, this is part of the problem's given information, hence an assumption. Therefore, each of these definitions is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n is defined as $\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{k}$,\nγ is defined as $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k}-\\ln n\\right)$,\nγ₁ is defined as $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\ln k}{k}-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln^2 n\\right)$,\nγ₂ is defined as $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\ln^2 k}{k}-\\frac{1}{3}\\ln^3 n\\right)$,\nγ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{H_n^2-(\\gamma + \\ln n)^2}{n} = \\dfrac{5}{3}\\zeta(3)-\\dfrac{2}{3}\\gamma^3-2\\gamma \\gamma_{1}-\\gamma_{2}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So in the example, two assumptions: n is integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, the first four definitions are each separate lines, each defining one object. The fifth line states a property of γ₁ and γ₂ (they are Stieltjes constants). But since it's a joint property of two objects, does that violate the \"applied to one object\" rule? The instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". Therefore, the fifth line should be split into two: γ₁ is a Stieltjes constant, γ₂ is a Stieltjes constant. But in the original problem statement, it's stated as \"γ₁, γ₂ being Stieltjes constants\". So perhaps to adhere to the format, each should be a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n is defined as $\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{k}$,\nγ is defined as $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k}-\\ln n\\right)$,\nγ₁ is defined as $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\ln k}{k}-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln^2 n\\right)$,\nγ₂ is defined as $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\ln^2 k}{k}-\\frac{1}{3}\\ln^3 n\\right)$,\nγ₁ is a Stieltjes constant,\nγ₂ is a Stieltjes constant.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{H_n^2-(\\gamma + \\ln n)^2}{n} = \\dfrac{5}{3}\\zeta(3)-\\dfrac{2}{3}\\gamma^3-2\\gamma \\gamma_{1}-\\gamma_{2}.$$\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user just mentions that γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants. Since the problem is to prove the equality, and the Stieltjes constants are part of the given definitions, perhaps the fact that they are Stieltjes constants is additional context but not an assumption. The definitions provided in the problem for γ₁ and γ₂ are specific to their representations, which might be equivalent to their definitions as Stieltjes constants. But since the problem explicitly states that they are Stieltjes constants, that's part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, including them as separate assumptions is correct. Each should be a separate line. So that's six assumptions: four definitions, and two stating γ₁ and γ₂ are Stieltjes constants.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's definitions of γ₁ and γ₂ might be equivalent to their definitions as Stieltjes constants. If that's the case, then perhaps the mention that they are Stieltjes constants is redundant, but since the problem states it, it should be included as an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would include all these assumptions. Thus, the final answer should be as above.",
