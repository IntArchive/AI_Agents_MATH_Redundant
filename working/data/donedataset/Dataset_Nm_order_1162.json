    "Content": "I was assigned the following homework problem for an introductory course in topology: Let $p:\\ X\\to Y$ be a closed continuous surjective map such that $p^{-1}(\\{y\\})$ is compact for each $y\\in Y$.  Show that if $Y$ is compact, then $X$ is compact. My question is, are the assumptions that $p$ be continuous and surjective even necessary for the result to hold?  I've done the following: Let $U$ be an open set containing $p^{-1}(\\{y\\})$.  Since $X-U$ is closed, $p(X-U)$ is closed in $Y$.  Then $W=Y-p(X-U)$ is an open set that contains $y$.  Since $(X-U)\\cap p^{-1}(W)=\\varnothing$, $p^{-1}(\\{y\\})\\subset p^{-1}(W) \\subset U$. Let $\\{U_\\alpha\\}$ be an open cover of $X$.  Then $p^{-1}(\\{y\\})\\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^{N}U_k$.  For each $y\\in Y$, define $W_{y}$ as above; then $\\{W_y\\}$ is an open cover of $Y$, so can be covered by $W_{y_1},...,W_{y_m}$, and $p^{-1}(\\{y_j\\})\\subset p^{-1}(W_{y_j})\\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^{N}U_k$.  Since $X=p^{-1}(Y)$, $X=\\bigcup_{j=1}^{n} p^{-1}(W_{y_j})$.  Since each $p^{-1}(W_{y_j})$ is covered by finitely many $U_k$, so is $X$, so it is compact. If we dispense with surjectivity of $p$, the only thing that happens is that $p^{-1}(\\{y\\})$ may be empty, but then $p^{-1}(\\{y\\})\\subset p^{-1}(W)$ holds vacuously, and the empty set is still compact. If $p$ is continuous, then $p^{-1}(W)$ is open, but I don't use the fact that it is open at all in my proof. I know that all 3 assumptions make a map \"perfect\" so that may be why they were mentioned, but can we dispense with continuity and surjectivity? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "but can we dispense with continuity and surjectivity? Yes. Your - correct - proof uses only the closedness of $p$ to show that every $y\\in Y$ has an open neighbourhood $W_y$ such that $p^{-1}(W_y)$ is covered by finitely many of the $U_\\alpha$, and since $Y$ is covered by finitely many $W_y$, it then follows that $X$ is covered by finitely many $U_\\alpha$. If one can prove something without using some assumptions in the statement of the theorem, these assumptions are then unnecessary to reach the conclusion.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about a homework problem from a topology course. The original problem states: Let p: X → Y be a closed continuous surjective map such that the preimage of each singleton {y} is compact. They need to show that if Y is compact, then X is compact. The user is questioning whether the assumptions that p is continuous and surjective are necessary for the conclusion.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property of a single object. Let's start by extracting the assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that p is a closed continuous surjective map, and that p^{-1}({y}) is compact for each y in Y. Then, Y is given as compact, and the conclusion is X is compact.\n\nSo, the original assumptions are:\n1. p is closed.\n2. p is continuous.\n3. p is surjective.\n4. For each y in Y, p^{-1}({y}) is compact.\n5. Y is compact.\n\nThe problem is to show that X is compact under these assumptions. The user's question is whether continuity and surjectivity of p are necessary. They argue in their proof attempt that maybe these conditions can be relaxed.\n\nBut according to the formatting example, we need to list each assumption line by line. However, the problem as posed in the homework includes all these assumptions. The user's formatted problem would need to include the necessary assumptions as per the problem, but perhaps in their restructured version, they want to question if some assumptions can be omitted. Wait, no. The task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question and structure it into the Assumption and Problem parts as per the example. The example took the original problem and formatted it, even if the user in the problem is questioning some assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it. Wait, no. The example given by the user is: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem? Wait, no. Let me check. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that's different. So in the example, the user restructured the problem, perhaps correcting a mistake or adding an assumption. Wait, maybe the original problem was missing an assumption? The user in the example is rephrasing the problem with corrected assumptions. So perhaps in that case, the original problem had an error, and the formatted version corrects it by adding the necessary assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in the case of the current problem, the user is questioning the necessity of certain assumptions. Hmm.\n\nBut according to the task, the user (me) should act as a knowledgeable math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and structure the problem into Assumption and Problem parts. The example shows that the original problem might have redundant or missing assumptions, and the formatted problem corrects that. So here, the user's problem is about a perfect map p: X→Y, where Y is compact implies X is compact. The original problem's assumptions are that p is closed, continuous, surjective, and each fiber p⁻¹{y} is compact. The user did a proof and thinks that continuity and surjectivity might not be needed. But the task here is not to answer that question, but to structure the problem as per the format.\n\nWait, the user's original problem is as stated in the homework: Let p: X→Y be a closed continuous surjective map with compact fibers, Y compact, then X compact. The user's question is whether continuity and surjectivity are needed. But when structuring the problem, do we include all original assumptions, or only the necessary ones? According to the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in that case, the original problem's conclusion was incorrect without that assumption, so the formatted problem corrects it. Here, the original problem's conclusion (X compact) follows from the given assumptions. The user is asking if some assumptions can be dropped. However, the task is to structure the problem as presented in the homework, not the user's question about the assumptions.\n\nWait, the user is presenting a problem from their homework and then questioning the necessity of some assumptions. But when structuring the problem according to the format, we need to present the problem as it was given, listing all the original assumptions, right? The example included the original problem's assumptions and added another one (n divisible by 7) but that was perhaps a correction. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. So maybe the original problem was incorrect, and the formatted problem corrects it. Therefore, the assistant here should check whether the original problem's assumptions are sufficient or not, and structure the problem with the necessary assumptions. However, in the current case, the problem as stated in the homework includes the assumptions that p is closed, continuous, surjective, and has compact fibers. The user is challenging whether continuity and surjectivity are needed.\n\nBut according to the task, the assistant is supposed to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem. The user's own musings about whether the assumptions are necessary might be part of the question, but the problem to be structured is the original homework problem. However, the user's question is: \"are the assumptions that p be continuous and surjective even necessary for the result to hold?\" So perhaps the formatted problem should include the original problem's assumptions, and then the problem is to determine if X is compact under those assumptions. Wait, but the problem as stated in the homework already includes those assumptions, and the task is to prove X is compact. However, the user is asking whether continuity and surjectivity are necessary. So maybe the problem to be structured is: \"Show that if Y is compact and p: X→Y is a closed map with compact fibers, then X is compact. Are the continuity and surjectivity of p necessary?\"\n\nBut the format requires that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property, applied to one object. Let me re-examine the example. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. So perhaps the example indicates that sometimes the original problem has missing assumptions, and the formatted problem corrects that. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps the original homework problem includes continuity and surjectivity, but the user is questioning their necessity. So if we structure the problem, should we include only the necessary assumptions? But how do we know which are necessary?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to structure the problem as presented by the user, which includes their question. Wait, the user's question is part of the problem. Let me read again the user's question:\n\n\"Let p: X→Y be a closed continuous surjective map such that p^{-1}({y}) is compact for each y∈Y. Show that if Y is compact, then X is compact. My question is, are the assumptions that p be continuous and surjective even necessary for the result to hold?\"\n\nSo the problem is to show that under the given assumptions (closed, continuous, surjective, compact fibers, Y compact), X is compact. Then the user's question is whether continuity and surjectivity are necessary. But in the format we need to present, the problem is the one that needs to be solved. However, the user is also asking a question about the necessity of the assumptions, which might form part of the problem. Wait, the example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the added assumption. So in this case, the problem is the original one, but maybe the user is pointing out that the original problem had superfluous assumptions, and the formatted problem would list only the necessary ones. But how do we know? Since the user is challenging the necessity, perhaps the formatted problem should include only the necessary assumptions. But since we are supposed to act as a knowledgeable professor, we need to know the correct answer here.\n\nIn topology, the statement that a closed map with compact fibers from X to Y, where Y is compact, implies X is compact, requires that the map is also surjective. Because if the map is not surjective, then the image is a closed subset of Y (since p is closed and continuous?), but Y is compact, so the image is compact. But then the fibers over the image are compact, but the part of X not mapped to Y would not be covered. Wait, actually, if p is not surjective, then X is the union of the fibers over the image of p, which is a closed subset of Y, hence compact. So if p: X→Y is closed, has compact fibers, and Y is compact, but p is not surjective, then the image p(X) is closed in Y, hence compact. Then X would be the union of compact fibers over a compact image, which might not be compact unless the indexing is finite. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nBut according to standard results, a perfect map (which is a closed continuous surjective map with compact fibers) preserves compactness. If you drop surjectivity, then the map is called \"proper\" if it is universally closed (closed with compact fibers, and continuous?), but terminology varies. However, the key point is that surjectivity might be necessary to ensure that X is compact. For example, suppose Y is compact, and X is a non-compact space. Let p: X→Y be a constant map (which is continuous, closed, but not surjective unless Y is a singleton). Then the fibers are all X (if p is constant at y₀, then p⁻¹(y₀) = X, and other fibers are empty. But in the problem statement, fibers are compact. So if p is constant, the fiber over y₀ is X, which must be compact. But if X is not compact, then this map would not satisfy the fiber condition. Wait, so if p is a closed map with compact fibers, and Y is compact, then even if p is not surjective, can X be non-compact?\n\nWait, suppose Y is compact, and p: X→Y is closed, has compact fibers, but is not surjective. Let Z = p(X), which is closed in Y (since p is closed), hence compact. Then X is the union of the fibers over Z, each of which is compact. But the union of compact sets need not be compact unless it's a finite union. However, Z is compact, so if we can cover Z with finitely many open sets in Y, and then pull them back, but this is getting too involved.\n\nIn any case, the standard theorem requires the map to be surjective. So the original problem includes surjectivity and continuity for a reason. The user's proof attempt might have a flaw if they didn't use continuity, but continuity is needed for the preimages of open sets to be open. However, in their proof, they defined W_y = Y - p(X - U), which requires p to be closed to ensure that p(X - U) is closed, hence W_y is open. Then they state that p⁻¹(W_y) is open, which would require p to be continuous. Wait, but in their proof, they say \"If p is continuous, then p⁻¹(W) is open, but I don't use the fact that it is open at all in my proof.\" So they might be using that p is closed to get that W_y is open, but not using continuity. However, if p is not continuous, then p⁻¹(W_y) might not be open, but in their proof, they say that they cover X by p⁻¹(W_yj), which are subsets of the finite union. Wait, maybe their proof is incorrect because they are assuming that p⁻¹(W_yj) can be covered by finitely many U_k, but if p⁻¹(W_yj) is not open, how does that work?\n\nThis is getting complex, but the key point is that the original problem's assumptions include continuity and surjectivity, and the user is questioning their necessity. To structure the problem correctly, we need to list all the original assumptions as per the homework problem. The user's own doubts are part of the question but not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list all the original assumptions:\n\nAssumption: p is a closed map,\nAssumption: p is continuous,\nAssumption: p is surjective,\nAssumption: For each y ∈ Y, p⁻¹({y}) is compact,\nAssumption: Y is compact.\n\nProblem: Show that X is compact.\n\nBut the user is asking whether the continuity and surjectivity are necessary. However, according to the example, the formatted problem should present the problem as intended, possibly correcting any missing assumptions. But in the example, the user added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. So maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrected it. In this case, perhaps the continuity and surjectivity are not necessary, and the formatted problem should exclude them? But that requires knowing the answer, which is that surjectivity is necessary, but continuity may not be.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem statement, the user is assigned to prove that X is compact given that p is closed, continuous, surjective, with compact fibers, and Y is compact. They then present a proof where they might not have used continuity and surjectivity, hence their question.\n\nBut according to standard topology, the result is true with the assumptions of p being closed, surjective, and having compact fibers. Continuity might not be necessary. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nA closed map is a map that sends closed sets to closed sets. A perfect map is usually defined as a closed continuous surjective map with compact fibers. The theorem is that if there exists a perfect map p: X→Y, then X is compact if and only if Y is compact. But in the problem, only one direction is given: if Y is compact, then X is compact.\n\nBut can we drop continuity? Suppose p is closed, surjective, has compact fibers, Y is compact, but p is not continuous. Can X still be compact? Alternatively, can we have a non-compact X with such a map to a compact Y?\n\nWait, consider X = [0, 1) (not compact) and Y = [0, 1] (compact). Define p: X → Y by p(x) = x. This is surjective, but p is not closed because the image of the closed set [0, 1) in X is [0,1), which is not closed in Y. So p needs to be closed. If we make p closed, say, by some other mapping. Suppose X is non-compact, Y is compact, and p is a closed surjective map with compact fibers. Is this possible?\n\nAlternatively, take Y as a singleton {y}, which is compact. Then X must be the fiber over y, which is compact. So in that case, X is compact. But if Y is a singleton, any map p: X→Y is continuous, closed, surjective, and the fiber is X itself. So in this case, the conditions force X to be compact.\n\nBut if Y is not a singleton. Suppose Y is compact, p: X→Y is closed, surjective, each fiber is compact, but X is not compact. Is this possible?\n\nI think such an example exists. Let me think. Let Y be the closed unit interval [0,1]. Let X be the disjoint union of [0,1] and a countably infinite discrete space D. Define p: X→Y by mapping [0,1] to Y via the identity, and mapping D to {0} in Y. Then p is surjective, since every point in Y is covered by [0,1]. The fibers: for y ≠ 0, p⁻¹(y) is a single point in [0,1], which is compact. For y=0, p⁻¹(0) is {0} ∪ D, which is not compact since D is infinite discrete. So this does not satisfy the fiber condition. So if we adjust this: let X be the disjoint union of [0,1] and a countably infinite compact space (which doesn't exist, as countably infinite compact spaces are not compact in Hausdorff spaces). Wait, in general, a countably infinite compact Hausdorff space is homeomorphic to a convergent sequence with its limit, which is compact. Let’s take X = [0,1] ∪ {1, 2, 3, ...} where the sequence {n} converges to 0 in [0,1]. Then X is compact. But we need X to be non-compact. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, take Y = [0,1], X = [0,1) × [0,1], and p: X→Y as the projection onto the first coordinate. Then p is continuous and surjective. The fibers are {x} × [0,1], which are compact. But X is not compact (as [0,1) is not compact). However, p is not closed. For example, the closed set { (1 - 1/n, n) | n ∈ ℕ } in X would project to {1 - 1/n}, which is closed in Y, but the limit point 1 is not in the image. Wait, no, projection maps in product spaces are open but not necessarily closed. So maybe this isn't closed. Alternatively, take a different map. This is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider the map p: ℝ → S¹ (the unit circle) given by p(t) = (cos t, sin t). This is continuous, surjective, but not closed. The fibers are discrete (countably infinite) hence not compact. So not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, let Y be a compact space, and X be a non-compact space with a closed surjective map p: X→Y with compact fibers. For example, take Y to be a point. Then X must be compact. So it's impossible. Wait, but if Y is a point, then p is automatically continuous, closed, surjective, and the fiber is X, which must be compact. So in that case, you can't have a non-compact X. But if Y is multi-point.\n\nWait, suppose Y is compact Hausdorff, and X is Y × ℕ, where ℕ is the discrete space of natural numbers. Then X is not compact. Define p: X→Y as the projection. Then p is continuous, surjective, and the fibers are ℕ, which are not compact. So this doesn't satisfy the fiber condition. If we make the fibers compact, say X is Y × K where K is compact, then X is compact if K is compact. But if K is not compact, then X is not compact. But p: Y×K→Y is continuous, surjective, closed if K is compact. Wait, if K is compact, then the projection is closed. But if K is not compact, the projection might not be closed.\n\nThis is getting too involved. The key point is that in standard topology, the result that if p: X→Y is a perfect map (closed, continuous, surjective, compact fibers) and Y is compact, then X is compact, is standard. The question is whether surjectivity and continuity are necessary.\n\nSurjectivity is necessary because if p is not surjective, then X is homeomorphic to the inverse image of p(X), which is closed in Y (since p is closed), hence compact. But X would be the union of compact fibers over a compact image. However, the union of compact spaces over a compact base might not be compact if the base is not finite. Wait, but in general, if you have a continuous map with compact fibers and compact image, the total space is compact? Not necessarily. For example, take Y = [0,1], X = [0,1] × ℕ, where ℕ is discrete. The projection p: X→Y is continuous, surjective, but fibers are ℕ, which are not compact. So that's not applicable. But if fibers are compact, even if infinitely many, but the base is compact, then the total space might still be non-compact. For example, take Y as a point, X as a compact space. Wait, no.\n\nAlternatively, take Y as a compact Hausdorff space, and X as the disjoint union of compact spaces indexed by Y, but the indexing is such that X is not compact. But if the map p: X→Y is the natural projection, then p is continuous, surjective, closed (since Y is Hausdorff and the fibers are compact), but X is the disjoint union of compact spaces, which is not compact if there are infinitely many components. Wait, but the disjoint union of infinitely many compact spaces is not compact. For example, take Y as a point, X as countably infinite disjoint copies of a point. Then X is discrete infinite, hence not compact, but Y is a point, p is continuous, surjective, closed, fibers are points (compact). But Y is compact. So this contradicts the theorem. But this example shows that without the map being a closed map, the theorem fails. Wait, but in this case, the map p is closed because any closed set in X is a union of closed sets in each fiber, which are compact, hence closed. But if Y is a point, then the only closed sets are finite unions of fibers, but since all fibers are points, any closed set in X is a collection of points. The image under p of a closed set in X is either empty or the whole Y (since Y is a point). But if we take a closed set in X that is, say, all even points, then its image is Y (since p is surjective), which is closed. Wait, but Y is a point, so any surjective map to Y is closed. Therefore, in this example, p: X→Y is closed, continuous, surjective, with compact fibers, Y is compact, but X is not compact. This contradicts the theorem. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, but if Y is a point, then X must be the fiber over that point, which is compact by assumption. But in my example, X is countably infinite discrete, which is not compact. However, if p is a map from X to Y (a point), then the fiber over Y is X itself. So if the problem assumes that each fiber is compact, then X must be compact. Therefore, in the problem's assumptions, since each fiber p⁻¹{y} is compact, and if Y is a point, then X is the fiber, hence compact. Therefore, my previous example is invalid because it violates the fiber condition. That is, if Y is a point, and p: X→Y has compact fiber, then X must be compact. So the previous example where X is countably infinite discrete and Y is a point would require that the fiber (X) is compact, which it's not. Hence, such a map cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem assumes that all fibers are compact, and p is closed, surjective, then X must be compact when Y is compact. Wait, but in the case where Y is a point, the only way to have a closed surjective map with compact fiber is if X is compact. Therefore, the theorem holds.\n\nBut in the case where Y is multi-point, say Y is [0,1], and X is a non-compact space with a closed surjective map p: X→Y with compact fibers. Is this possible?\n\nSuppose Y = [0,1]. Let X be the space obtained by taking Y and replacing each point y in Y with a compact fiber F_y. If we take X as the disjoint union of F_y for each y ∈ Y, and give X the disjoint union topology, then X is not compact if there are infinitely many non-empty F_y. But the map p: X→Y sending each F_y to y is continuous, surjective, and closed if each F_y is compact and Y is compact. Wait, but in the disjoint union topology, X is homeomorphic to Y × F, where F is a discrete space of fibers. But if F is compact discrete, it must be finite. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, take X as the product space Y × K, where K is a compact space. Then the projection p: Y × K → Y is continuous, surjective, closed (if K is compact), and has fibers homeomorphic to K, hence compact. Then X is compact if Y and K are compact. But in this case, X is compact. So this doesn't help.\n\nAnother approach: Suppose Y is compact, and X is a non-compact space. Can there exist a closed surjective map p: X→Y with compact fibers? If such a map exists, then the theorem would fail, meaning that continuity is necessary. But I need to construct an example.\n\nConsider Y = [0,1], compact. Let X = [0,1] × ℕ, where ℕ has the discrete topology. Define p: X→Y by p(y, n) = y. This map is continuous, surjective, but fibers are ℕ, which are not compact. So this doesn't satisfy the fiber condition. If we replace ℕ with a compact space, say K = {1, 2} with discrete topology, then X = Y × K is compact. So again, no help.\n\nAlternatively, take X = Y × [0,1) with projection p: X→Y. Then fibers are [0,1), which are not compact. So not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, let X be the space Y with each point y replaced by a compact set F_y. If we can topologize X such that the map p: X→Y collapsing each F_y to y is closed, has compact fibers, and X is non-compact. But this seems difficult because if each F_y is compact and Y is compact, then under suitable topology, X might be compact. For example, if X is the union of compact spaces over a compact base, but with a topology that makes the total space compact. For instance, the one-point compactification of an infinite disjoint union of compact spaces. But this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven the difficulty in constructing such an example, it's likely that the standard theorem requires the map to be surjective, closed, and have compact fibers, but continuity might not be necessary. Wait, but in the user's proof, they use the fact that p is closed to get that certain images are closed, but they don't use continuity. However, continuity is usually required to ensure that preimages of open sets are open, which is used in standard proofs involving covers. However, in their proof, they define W_y = Y - p(X - U), which is open because p is closed. Then p⁻¹(W_y) is a subset of U. But if p is not continuous, p⁻¹(W_y) might not be open. However, in their proof, they don't use that p⁻¹(W_y) is open, only that it's a subset of U. They then cover X with p⁻¹(W_yj), each of which is covered by finitely many U_k. But if p⁻¹(W_yj) are not open, how does this cover X? Because X is the union of p⁻¹(W_yj), which is true because the W_yj cover Y (since p is surjective). So even if p⁻¹(W_yj) are not open, their union is still X. However, each p⁻¹(W_yj) is contained in a finite union of U_k. Therefore, even if the sets p⁻¹(W_yj) are not open, the fact that they are covered by finite U_k means that the entire X is covered by finite U_k. So maybe continuity is not needed.\n\nBut this suggests that the proof goes through without continuity. However, in standard topology, continuity is part of the definition of a perfect map. But perhaps in this specific proof, continuity is not required. Therefore, the user might be correct that continuity is not needed, but surjectivity is. Because if p is not surjective, then X is the union of fibers over the image, which is a closed subset of Y (hence compact), but the fibers over the image are compact, but the total space might not be compact. For example, if the image is a compact subset of Y, then X is the union of compact fibers over a compact set. But an arbitrary union of compact sets is not necessarily compact. However, if the map p is closed, then the image of X is closed in Y, hence compact. Then X is the union of compact fibers over a compact image. But how does that ensure X is compact?\n\nIn the user's proof, they use that Y is compact to get a finite subcover of W_yj, and then X is the union of p⁻¹(W_yj), each of which is covered by finitely many U_k. This requires that each p⁻¹(W_yj) can be covered by finitely many U_k. But how do they know that? Because in their construction, for each y, they choose U_1, ..., U_N covering p⁻¹({y}), then define W_y such that p⁻¹(W_y) is contained in the union of U_1, ..., U_N. Therefore, even if p⁻¹(W_y) is not open, it's contained in the finite union, so when they cover Y with W_yj, the union of p⁻¹(W_yj) is X, and each p⁻¹(W_yj) is contained in finitely many U_k, hence X is covered by finitely many U_k.\n\nBut this seems to work even if p is not continuous. Because the key steps are: p is closed (to get W_y open), surjective (to ensure the W_y cover Y), and fibers are compact. So continuity might not be needed. Therefore, the user's observation might be correct: continuity is not necessary, but surjectivity is. However, in the standard definition, continuity is part of the perfect map. But perhaps in this specific proof, continuity is not used.\n\nHowever, another aspect: if p is not continuous, then p being closed is a weaker condition. But in the user's proof, they only use that p is closed and surjective, with compact fibers. Therefore, the formatted problem might not need continuity as an assumption. But the original problem includes continuity. The user is asking whether it's necessary.\n\nGiven all this, to structure the problem as per the example, we need to list the assumptions. The example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Here, the original problem includes continuity and surjectivity, but the user's proof suggests they might not be needed. However, to structure the problem correctly, we need to see if the original problem's conclusion holds without those assumptions. If the answer is that surjectivity is necessary but continuity is not, then the formatted problem should list the necessary assumptions. But since the user is asking whether they are necessary, the formatted problem would list the original assumptions and the problem is to prove X is compact. But the user's actual question is about the necessity, which is a separate thing. However, the task is to format the problem, not answer the question.\n\nWait, the user's entire post is the question. The title is \"Perfect Map p: X→Y, Y compact implies X compact\", then in the question, they present the homework problem and ask if continuity and surjectivity are necessary. So the problem to format is the homework problem, and the user's question is about the assumptions. But according to the instructions, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter the unrelated information, and structure that problem into the format. The \"unrelated information\" might be the user's own proof attempt and their question about the assumptions. But the core problem is the homework problem: Prove that if p: X→Y is a closed continuous surjective map with compact fibers, and Y is compact, then X is compact. Are the assumptions of continuity and surjectivity necessary?\n\nBut the example given in the instructions includes an original problem and a formatted problem where the formatted problem corrects/refines the assumptions. Here, the user is questioning the assumptions, so perhaps the formatted problem should list the minimal assumptions needed. But since we are to act as a knowledgeable professor, we should know whether continuity and surjectivity are necessary.\n\nFrom the above discussion, surjectivity is necessary. If p is not surjective, then X is the preimage of the image of p, which is closed in Y (since p is closed), hence compact. The fibers over the image are compact, but X would be the union of compact fibers over a compact image. However, an arbitrary union of compact sets is not necessarily compact unless it's a finite union. But in this case, the image is compact, so we can cover it with finitely many open sets W_yj, and each p⁻¹(W_yj) is covered by finitely many U_k, leading to X being compact. Wait, this is what the user's proof does. However, if p is not surjective, then the image p(X) is closed in Y, hence compact, and the proof would apply to p: X→p(X), which is surjective. Hence, X would be compact. Therefore, even without surjectivity, X is compact. Wait, this contradicts the earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, if p: X→Y is closed, has compact fibers, and Y is compact, then p(X) is closed in Y, hence compact. Then, applying the user's proof to the map p: X→p(X), which is closed (since p(X) is closed in Y and p is closed), surjective, continuous (if restricted), but continuity might not matter. Then by the user's proof, X would be compact. Therefore, surjectivity is not necessary. This suggests that both surjectivity and continuity can be dropped. But wait, this can't be right.\n\nWait, suppose Y is compact, and p: X→Y is closed, has compact fibers, but is not surjective. Then p(X) is closed in Y, hence compact. Let Z = p(X). Then the map p: X→Z is closed, surjective, has compact fibers, and Z is compact. By the user's proof, X should be compact. Therefore, surjectivity is not necessary. Hence, the original problem's surjectivity assumption can be dropped. Continuity: if p is not continuous, but closed, surjective (or not), with compact fibers. Does the user's proof require continuity? In their proof, they take an open cover {U_α} of X. For each y, p⁻¹({y}) is compact, so covered by finitely many U_α's. Then they define W_y = Y - p(X - union of those U_α's). Since p is closed, p(X - union) is closed, so W_y is open. Then {W_y} is an open cover of Y, hence has a finite subcover. Then X is the union of p⁻¹(W_yj), each of which is covered by the finite U_α's. This works even if p is not continuous, because the key is that p is closed to ensure W_y is open. Continuity is not used. Therefore, continuity can be dropped as well.\n\nTherefore, the minimal assumptions are: p is closed, has compact fibers, and Y is compact. Surjectivity and continuity are not needed. Hence, the formatted problem should list these assumptions. But the original problem includes continuity and surjectivity, so perhaps the user's formatted problem should cor",
