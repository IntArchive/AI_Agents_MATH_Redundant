    "AcceptedAnswer": "The problem, indeed, is very cute. We just need to check the condition $\\textrm{mod } 5$ : $$u_1 \\equiv 1 \\textrm{ mod } 5$$ $$u_2 \\equiv 2 \\textrm{ mod } 5$$ $$u_3 \\equiv 2 \\textrm{ mod } 5$$ etc. Therefore, one can show by induction that for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ : $$u_{n+1} \\equiv \\left[ n+1+\\sum_{j=2}^n (-1) \\right] \\textrm{ mod } 5 \\equiv 2 \\textrm{ mod } 5.$$ The latter is never true for squares, since squares are equal to either 0,1 or 4 mod 5. To prove the generalization, we use the recurrence relation of type $$u_{n+1} = u_n^2+u_n+a.$$ Notice that $u_{n+1}>u_n^2$ since $a>0$ . Therefore, if $u_{n+1}$ is a perfect square, then $a\\geq u_n+1 > u_n$ . But $a>u_n$ is impossible since for any $n \\geq 3$ : $$u_{n} = u_{n-1}^2+u_{n-1}+a >a.$$ This gives us a contradiction, so $u_n$ is never a perfect square for any $n\\geq 3$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to parse this problem. The original question is about showing that for a sequence defined recursively, starting with u₁ = 1, and each subsequent term u_{n+1} being equal to n plus the sum of the squares of the previous terms up to n, then for n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square. The user also mentions a generalization with parameters a and b, but the main problem seems to focus on the case where a=1 and b=0.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem defines the sequence with u₁ = 1. Then, for each n, u_{n+1} is calculated as n plus the sum of u_k² from k=1 to n. The goal is to show that from n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square. \n\nLooking at the example provided in the original question, the user structured assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. u₁ is defined as 1. That's a single condition on the initial term.\n2. The recursive relation: For each n, u_{n+1} equals n plus the sum of squares of u₁ to uₙ. This is another single condition on how the sequence progresses.\n3. The problem states that for n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square. Wait, but the original statement says \"for n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square.\" However, the user wrote in their example that the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7,\" which was part of the problem's condition. Here, the problem is to show that from n ≥ 2 onwards, u_n isn't a square. But how does that fit into assumptions? Wait, in the example, the assumption was part of the problem's given conditions, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove that under the given recursive definition, u_n is not a square for n ≥ 2. So perhaps the assumption here is the definition of the sequence and the initial term. The \"problem\" part is to prove the non-square property.\n\nSo the assumptions should list the given conditions:\n\n- u₁ = 1\n- For each n, u_{n+1} = n + ∑_{k=1}^n u_k²\n\nThen the problem is to show that for n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the problem here, the user's question is \"show that, for n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square.\" So the problem's conditions are the recursive definitions, and the conclusion is that for n ≥ 2, u_n isn't a square. Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions of the sequence, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- u₁ = 1\n- For each n, u_{n+1} = n + ∑_{k=1}^n (u_k)²\n\nProblem: Show that for n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square.\n\nBut the user's original example included both the general condition (n is an integer) and a specific condition (n divisible by 7). Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n needs to be divisible by 7. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example's problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not requiring n to be divisible by 7. However, the formatted problem in the example includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which contradicts. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants me to follow their formatting style. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example.\n\nBut regardless, according to the user's instruction, I need to list all assumptions of the problem line by line, each addressing only one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the sequence is defined with u₁=1 and the recursive formula. The problem is to show that from n ≥ 2, u_n is not a square. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. u₁ = 1\n2. For each n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = n + ∑_{k=1}^n (u_k)^2\n\nThen the problem is to show that for all integers n ≥ 2, u_n is not a square.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user writes \"for n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square.\" So the variable n here is the index of the sequence. So n in the problem refers to the term's position in the sequence, and we need to show that starting from the second term (since n ≥ 2), u_n is not a square. So the assumptions are the definitions of the sequence, and the problem is to prove the non-square property for n ≥ 2.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions as:\n\n- u₁ = 1\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} = n + ∑_{k=1}^n (u_k)²\n\nProblem: Show that for all integers n ≥ 2, u_n is not a square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second assumption should state that the recurrence holds for all n ≥ 1. Each assumption should address one condition. So splitting:\n\n1. u₁ = 1\n2. For each integer n ≥ 1, u_{n+1} is defined as n plus the sum of squares of u₁ through uₙ\n\nThat's two separate assumptions. Then the problem is to show that for n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square.\n\nThe user's original example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the problem was about \"for every integer n\". Maybe in the example, the user considered that the problem assumes n is an integer, hence listing it. So here, since the problem is about integer n (as the sequence terms are indexed by integers), perhaps we need to list that n is an integer. But in the problem statement, n is a positive integer by the definition of the sequence. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- u₁ = 1\n- For each positive integer n, u_{n+1} = n + ∑_{k=1}^n (u_k)²\n\nProblem: Show that for each integer n ≥ 2, u_n is not a perfect square.\n\nBut in the original problem's statement, the user wrote \"for n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square.\" So the problem is phrased as proving that for those n, u_n is not a square. The assumptions are the initial condition and the recurrence relation.\n\nSo following the example's structure, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. u₁ = 1\n2. For each n, u_{n+1} = n + ∑_{k=1}^n u_k²\n\nBut the second assumption should specify the domain of n. In the problem, n is a positive integer since it's a sequence. So maybe:\n\n- u₁ = 1\n- For each positive integer n, u_{n+1} = n + ∑_{k=1}^n u_k²\n\nProblem: Show that for each integer n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object (the sequence's initial term and the recurrence relation for each n). The problem is to prove the non-square property for n ≥ 2.\n\nThe user's example had two assumptions even though the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. Wait, the original example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem's statement was \"for every integer n\", not restricted to n divisible by 7. However, the user's formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is wrong. Perhaps that example was a mistake. But since the user provided that example as a guide, I should follow their structure, even if it's incorrect. But maybe the original problem in the example had an error. Alternatively, perhaps the example was from a different problem where n was required to be divisible by 7.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the correct assumptions are the initial term and the recurrence relation, and the problem is to show that from n ≥ 2, the terms are not squares.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nu₁ = 1,\nFor each positive integer n, u_{n+1} = n + ∑_{k=1}^n (u_k)²\nProblem:\nShow that for each integer n ≥ 2, u_n is never a square.\n\nThat's two assumptions and the problem statement.",
