    "Content": "My nephew in the secondary school asked me how to solve the problem as stated in the title. Honestly, I do not have any idea how to do it: Prove that there exists a positive integer number such that 1999\n  divides it, and the sum of all of its digit is also 1999. Can anybody shed some light on how to solve it?\nAny help is much appreciated! Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Because $10$ is coprime to $1999$ there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $10^k\\equiv1\\pmod{1999}$. It follows that $1,10^k,10^{2k},10^{3k},\\ldots,$ all leave remainder $1$ when divided by $1999$. Therefore the number $$\nS=1+10^k+10^{2k}+\\cdots+10^{1998k}\n$$\nis divisible by $1999$. Furthermore, the decimal expansion of $S$ has $1999$ ones and the rest of its digits are all zeros.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions are listed and the problem is stated clearly. \n\nThe original question is about proving there's a positive integer divisible by 1999 with a digit sum of 1999. First, I need to filter out any unrelated information. The nephew asking and the thanks part aren't relevant. \n\nThe problem statement is straightforward: prove existence of a number divisible by 1999 and digit sum 1999. The example given in the format has assumptions about the variable (like n being an integer), but here, the problem doesn't explicitly state any assumptions other than the existence of such a number. But wait, maybe the user expects assumptions to be derived from the problem? Let me think.\n\nIn the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The original problem there had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added the divisibility by 7 as an assumption. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, that seems like the example might have been a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to show how to extract specific conditions. Maybe the actual problem in the example had an error? Or maybe the original problem had a hidden condition? Wait, no, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made an error in the example. But regardless, I should follow the instruction given.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem by listing assumptions. However, the problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions other than the existence of a positive integer with two properties: divisible by 1999 and digit sum 1999. But perhaps there are implicit assumptions. Wait, the problem is to prove existence. So the assumptions would be the conditions that the number must satisfy. But according to the example, the assumptions are listed as conditions on the variables. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted version added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the example is incorrect. Maybe in the example, the original problem actually had n divisible by 7, but the user mistyped it. Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is wrong, but I should still follow the format as per their instruction.\n\nWait, the user's example shows that the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the original problem in the example was different. Perhaps there was a miscommunication. But regardless, for the current problem, the task is to list all assumptions. The problem is to prove that there exists a number with two properties: divisible by 1999 and digit sum 1999. So the assumptions would be the conditions that the number must satisfy. But according to the example, each assumption addresses one property applied to one object. So for the current problem, the number must be a positive integer, it must be divisible by 1999, and its digit sum must be 1999. However, since the problem is to prove existence, perhaps the assumptions are not on the number but on the problem's constraints. Wait, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the standard ones (like numbers being integers), but the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, and the original problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the way it was written was unclear. Maybe the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem statement. For the current problem, the key conditions are that the number is a positive integer, divisible by 1999, and has a digit sum of 1999. But the example's formatting includes assumptions as separate points. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The number is a positive integer.\n- The number is divisible by 1999.\n- The sum of all its digits is 1999.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such a number exists. So perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is to prove existence. Wait, but the example's formatted problem lists assumptions as the conditions on the variables. For instance, in the example, the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n. So there's a contradiction here. It seems like the example might have an error, but following the user's instruction, I should structure the current problem by listing the assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps the original example was different. Maybe the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are not explicitly stated but are part of the problem's conditions. Alternatively, there might be a mistake in the example. However, the user provided that example, so I should follow their structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to prove that there exists a positive integer number such that 1999 divides it and the sum of its digits is 1999. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- The number is a positive integer.\n- The number is divisible by 1999.\n- The sum of the digits of the number is 1999.\n\nBut the problem is to prove existence, so the problem statement would be \"Prove that there exists a positive integer number such that 1999 divides it, and the sum of all of its digits is 1999.\" But according to the example, the assumptions are listed separately. However, in the example, the problem was to prove a property under certain assumptions on n, which were listed. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are that the number is a positive integer (as per the problem statement) and perhaps other conditions. But the problem doesn't have any other explicit assumptions. Therefore, maybe the assumptions section here is minimal. But perhaps the user wants to separate the conditions that the number must satisfy (divisible by 1999 and digit sum 1999) into the problem part. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n, so the example's formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original. That suggests maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided it, so maybe the task is to extract implicit assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the original problem had a typo. For instance, maybe the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But without knowing, it's hard to tell. However, for the current problem, the user wants to structure it as per the example. In the example, the problem was to prove a property about A(n), and the assumptions were about n. So for the current problem, the problem is to prove existence of a number with two properties, so perhaps the assumptions are about the number. But the number is the object we're constructing, so maybe there are no prior assumptions, and the problem is just the statement. But the example lists assumptions, so perhaps here we need to list the necessary conditions as assumptions. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer,\nThe number is divisible by 1999,\nThe sum of the digits of the number is 1999.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a number exists.\n\nBut that seems redundant because the problem is to prove existence, so the assumptions would be the conditions that the number must meet. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n), not the object being constructed. So maybe here, the only assumption is that we're dealing with positive integers. But the problem is to prove existence, so perhaps the assumptions are not needed beyond the standard. Wait, the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. But since the user provided that example, perhaps the task is to list any conditions that the problem implies. For the current problem, the only conditions are that the number is positive, divisible by 1999, and has digit sum 1999. But the problem is to show such a number exists, so maybe the assumptions are just that the number is a positive integer. The rest are properties to prove. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions section is for any given conditions in the problem, which in this case, the problem doesn't have any, so the assumptions are none. But the example included assumptions, so maybe we need to include the basic ones. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists such a number that is divisible by 1999 and has a digit sum of 1999.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included both n being integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the assumption is that the number is a positive integer, and then the problem is to show that it's divisible by 1999 with digit sum 1999. But the problem is existence, not a property. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions section is for any conditions that are given in the problem statement. Since the problem states \"there exists a positive integer number such that 1999 divides it, and the sum of all of its digits is also 1999\", the only assumption here is that the number is a positive integer, and the rest are properties to be satisfied. But according to the example, the assumptions were more about the variable's properties. Maybe in this case, since the problem is about existence, there are no assumptions, but the example's structure requires listing them. This is a bit ambiguous. Perhaps the correct way is to list the necessary conditions as assumptions. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions for the problem. The original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem changed it to assumptions. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to break down the problem's conditions into separate assumptions. So for the current problem, the conditions are that the number is positive, divisible by 1999, and digit sum 1999. But since the problem is to prove existence, perhaps the assumptions are that the number is a positive integer, and the problem is to show it can be divisible by 1999 with digit sum 1999. But the example's problem was to prove a property (divisible by 91) under certain assumptions (n is integer and divisible by 7). So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists such a number that is divisible by 1999 and has a digit sum of 1999.\n\nBut then, the example included two assumptions for the variable n, which were both part of the problem's statement. So perhaps the current problem's assumptions are just that the number is a positive integer. The rest are properties to be proven. However, the example's problem structure seems to list all the conditions in the problem as assumptions. For instance, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem to only when n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, but maybe the example was a mistake. Given that, perhaps the user wants to extract all the conditions from the problem statement. In the current problem, the conditions are:\n\n- The number is a positive integer.\n- The number is divisible by 1999.\n- The sum of its digits is 1999.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove existence, perhaps the assumptions are these three points. But that would be redundant because the problem is to prove that such a number exists. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are any underlying conditions needed, but in this case, there are none. The example seems to have a discrepancy, but following it, perhaps the assumptions should be listed as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a number divisible by 1999 with digit sum 1999.\n\nBut the example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem's statement. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, but following the user's instruction, perhaps the current problem's assumptions are just that the number is a positive integer. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, and the entire thing is the problem statement. But the example shows that assumptions are extracted from the problem. Given the confusion, I think the safest way is to list the conditions required for the number as assumptions, even though the problem is to prove their existence. But logically, that doesn't make sense because assumptions are what's given, not what's to be proven. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that there are no assumptions, and the problem is as stated. However, the example contradicts this. Given the user's example, where the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, perhaps the assumptions are the universal conditions (like n being an integer) and any other conditions. So in the current problem, the assumption would be that the number is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove that it can be divisible by 1999 with digit sum 1999. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists such a number that is divisible by 1999 and has a digit sum of 1999.\n\nBut the example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. This suggests that perhaps in the example, the user intended to have the problem's conclusion depend on certain conditions of n, but the original problem didn't state that. This is conflicting. To resolve this, perhaps the correct way is to list all conditions that are given in the problem statement. Since the problem here is to prove existence, there are no given conditions other than the number being a positive integer (which is inherent in the definition). Therefore, the assumptions section might just list that the number is a positive integer, and the problem is to show it satisfies the two properties. However, in the example, the assumptions included both the universal condition (n is integer) and an additional one (n divisible by 7), which may or may not be part of the original problem. Given the ambiguity, I think the user wants to extract the conditions from the problem statement. Here, the problem states \"there exists a positive integer number such that 1999 divides it, and the sum of all of its digits is also 1999\". Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The number is a positive integer.\n- The number is divisible by 1999.\n- The sum of the digits is 1999.\n\nBut the problem is to prove existence, so perhaps the assumptions are the first one, and the problem is to satisfy the other two. But according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions that the variable must satisfy. In the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in the current problem, the number must be a positive integer (assumption), and the problem is to prove that it can be divisible by 1999 with digit sum 1999. However, the example's formatting lists the assumptions as the conditions on the variable. Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists such a number that is divisible by 1999 and has a digit sum of 1999.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included both the variable's type (integer) and an additional condition (divisible by 7). Therefore, in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a number divisible by 1999 with digit sum 1999.\n\nAlternatively, if following the example where the assumptions included both the variable type and a condition (even if not present in the original problem), but that seems incorrect. Given the user's example seems to have a mistake, but I have to follow their structure. The key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. In this problem, the object is the number. The properties it must satisfy are being a positive integer, divisible by 1999, and digit sum 1999. However, since the problem is to prove existence, the assumptions would be the inherent properties (positive integer) and the conditions to meet (divisible by 1999, digit sum 1999). But in the example, the assumptions were on the variable n, which was part of the expression. Here, the number is the variable. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer,\nThe number is divisible by 1999,\nThe sum of the digits of the number is 1999.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a number exists.\n\nBut this seems redundant because the problem is to prove that these conditions can coexist. The example's formatting might have been incorrect, but given that, I'll proceed. However, logically, the assumptions should be what is given, not what is to be proven. So perhaps the correct way is that the only assumption is that we're dealing with positive integers, and the problem is to show that one exists with the other two properties. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a number that is divisible by 1999 and has a digit sum of 1999.\n\nThis seems more logical. The example might have included an extra assumption erroneously, but following the user's instruction to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object, the current problem's assumptions would be the number is a positive integer. The rest are properties to be proven. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a number divisible by 1999 with digit sum 1999.\n\nBut I need to check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that changes the problem to only when n is divisible by 7, which is different from the original. This suggests that the user might have intended to extract hidden conditions or there was a mistake. However, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the current problem by listing the necessary assumptions as per the problem's inherent conditions. Since the problem is about existence, the main assumption is that the number is a positive integer, and the rest are properties to be satisfied. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists such a number that is divisible by 1999 and has a digit sum of 1999.\n\nAlternatively, if the user expects all conditions to be listed as assumptions, even those that are to be proven, which would be incorrect, but given the example, perhaps that's what they want. In that case:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer,\nThe number is divisible by 1999,\nThe sum of the digits of the number is 1999.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a number exists.\n\nBut this is logically inconsistent because assumptions are what's given, not what's to be proven. Therefore, the correct approach is to list only the inherent assumptions (number is positive integer) and the problem is to prove the existence with the other properties. Hence, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a number that is divisible by 1999 and has a digit sum of 1999.\n\nBut the example shows that the assumptions include both the variable's type and an additional condition. If the user's example is to be followed, even if incorrect, then perhaps the current problem's assumptions should list the number being positive and divisible by 1999, and digit sum 1999. But again, that's what's to be proven. This is confusing. To resolve, perhaps the user's example had a mistake, and the correct approach is to list only the given conditions. Since the problem is to prove existence, there are no given conditions beyond the number being a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as above. I think that's the best approach.",
