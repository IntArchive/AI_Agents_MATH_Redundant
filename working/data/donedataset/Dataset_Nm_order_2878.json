    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The original question is about proving a limit involving a harmonic mean subtracted by x as x approaches infinity.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions a limit as x approaches infinity. The expression inside the limit is (n divided by the sum of reciprocals of (x + a_i) minus x). The goal is to show this limit equals the average of the a_i's.\n\nAssumptions: Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The variable x is approaching infinity.\n2. The terms in the denominator are reciprocals of (x + a_i) for i from 1 to n.\n3. The sum is of 1/(x + a_i) for each i.\n4. The problem specifies that Taylor expansion cannot be used. So that's an assumption about the method not allowed.\n\nWait, the problem states \"Taylor expansion cannot be used,\" which is a constraint on the solution method. But according to the example, assumptions are about the problem's conditions, not the solution method. Hmm. The example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is a condition on the problem's variables.\n\nIn the original problem here, the user mentions \"Taylor expansion cannot be used,\" but that's more about the method to solve, not the problem's inherent conditions. So maybe that shouldn't be an assumption here. The problem's conditions are about x approaching infinity, the sum of reciprocals, and the expression structure.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real variable approaching infinity.\n- For each i from 1 to n, a_i is a constant.\n- The expression involves the sum of 1/(x + a_i) for i = 1 to n.\n- The problem requires evaluating the limit as x approaches infinity.\n\nBut the problem statement itself doesn't specify any conditions on the a_i's, like they are real numbers, distinct, etc. The user didn't mention any, so perhaps no assumptions on a_i other than they are constants. Wait, but in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about a limit as x approaches infinity, and the answer is the average of a_i. So perhaps the a_i's are constants, and n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify, but in mathematical problems like this, n would be a positive integer, and a_i's are real constants. So maybe those are implicit assumptions.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable approaching infinity,\nn is a positive integer,\nEach a_i is a constant,\nThe sum in the denominator is over n terms 1/(x + a_i).\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly say n is a positive integer, but given the context (sum from i=1 to n), n must be a positive integer. Similarly, x is approaching infinity, so it's a real variable. The a_i's are constants, so they don't depend on x.\n\nPutting this together, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- Each a_i is a constant (real number).\n- The limit is taken as x approaches infinity.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the given expression equals (a1 + ... + an)/n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem's original question doesn't state any restrictions on a_i or n except what's implied. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nEach a_i is a real constant,\nx is approaching infinity.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't restrict a_i, so maybe no need to assume they are distinct or anything else. The problem is as stated. So the formatted problem would have the assumptions listed as each of these, and the problem is the limit expression.\n\nThe user's example included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each as separate lines. Here, n is a positive integer (assuming that, because the sum is from 1 to n), and each a_i is a constant. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nEach a_i is a constant,\nThe limit is evaluated as x approaches infinity.\n\nBut \"the limit is evaluated as x approaches infinity\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the problem says \"Prove that the limit as x approaches infinity of [expression] equals [something]\". So the assumption would be that x approaches infinity, but that's part of the problem's statement. Wait, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in this case, the assumptions would be the underlying conditions needed for the problem to hold. But the problem as stated doesn't have any hidden assumptions besides what's given.\n\nWait, maybe the key here is that the user's example extracted two assumptions from the original problem: the first that n is an integer (which was given in the problem statement as \"for every integer n\"), and the second assumption that n is divisible by 7 (which was not stated in the original problem, but perhaps the user made a mistake there? Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was wrong. Because the original problem doesn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem adds that as an assumption. That would be incorrect. Wait, maybe the original problem had that condition, but in the user's example, they presented it incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps there was a miscommunication. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is a restriction. That seems like a mistake in the example. Perhaps the user made an error in their example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7. Unless the original problem had a different condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the example's formatting is correct. But the user's example's original problem is written as \"for every integer n\", which conflicts with the assumption. So perhaps the example has an error. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn any case, back to the current problem. The problem is to prove the limit as x approaches infinity of [n / (sum 1/(x + a_i)) - x] equals the average of a_i.\n\nThe assumptions here would be:\n\n- x approaches infinity.\n\nBut x approaching infinity is part of the limit statement, so perhaps not an assumption. The example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was stated in the original problem. Here, the original problem states \"the limit as x approaches infinity\", so maybe that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The assumptions are underlying conditions. For example, in the current problem, the sum is from i=1 to n, so n must be a positive integer. The a_i's must be constants (i.e., not functions of x). So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- Each a_i is a real constant.\n\n- The limit is taken as x approaches infinity.\n\nBut the limit being taken as x approaches infinity is part of the problem statement. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- Each a_i is a constant.\n\nBecause the problem says \"the limit as x approaches infinity\", so that's part of the problem's question, not an assumption. Similarly, the sum is over n terms, so n must be a positive integer, and a_i are constants (not depending on x). So those are the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a positive integer,\n\nEach a_i is a constant.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that\n\n$$\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\left(\\frac{n}{\\frac{1}{x+a_1}+\\frac{1}{x+a_2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{x+a_n}} - x\\right) = \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n}{n}.$$\n\nAdditionally, the original question mentioned that Taylor expansion cannot be used. However, in the example, the assumption included conditions on the variables, not on the method. Therefore, since the user's instruction says to \"filter the unrelated information\", the fact that Taylor expansion cannot be used is part of the problem's constraints but not an assumption about the mathematical objects. Therefore, it's part of the problem statement, but perhaps not an assumption. However, the user's example didn't include such constraints in the assumptions. So in this case, maybe the \"Taylor expansion cannot be used\" is a restriction on the solution method, which should be mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nBut the user's format requires the problem to be restated concisely. The original problem includes \"Taylor expansion cannot be used.\" Should that be included in the problem statement or in the assumptions?\n\nLooking back at the example: the original problem didn't mention any method restrictions, and the formatted problem didn't include them. However, in the current problem, the user's original question mentions \"Taylor expansion cannot be used.\" The user's instruction says to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem. Since the method restriction is not an assumption about the problem's conditions but a constraint on the solution, perhaps it should be omitted in the formatted problem. Or maybe it's part of the problem statement.\n\nIn the example, the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was not stated in the original problem. Wait, that suggests that maybe the example was incorrect. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7. Therefore, perhaps the user's example was wrong, and the actual process is to extract all the conditions from the problem, even if they are part of the problem's statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the question is to prove the limit equals the average. The assumptions needed for the limit to hold would be that the a_i's are constants (so that as x approaches infinity, each term 1/(x + a_i) behaves like 1/x). If any a_i were functions of x, that could complicate things, but the problem states \"the limit as x approaches infinity\", so a_i are presumably constants. Also, n is a positive integer because the sum is from 1 to n.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- Each a_i is a constant.\n\nThe problem is to prove the given limit equals (a1 + ... + an)/n.\n\nThe restriction on Taylor expansion is part of the problem's context but not an assumption on the mathematical objects. Since the user wants to filter unrelated information, perhaps that can be omitted. But the original problem includes it. So maybe include it as part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem's question is:\n\n\"I have to prove that: [limit expression]. The way I started doing this is: [steps]. Then I combine x with the rest, but that leads me nowhere. Any tips on how to do this? Taylor expansion cannot be used.\"\n\nSo the user mentions that Taylor expansion cannot be used. Therefore, in structuring the problem, should that constraint be included? The example given by the user included the assumption from the problem (even if the example had a mistake). But in this case, the method restriction is part of the problem's requirements. However, in academic problems, sometimes such constraints are part of the instructions but not part of the mathematical problem per se. So perhaps the formatted problem should include the mathematical assumptions and the problem statement, excluding the method restrictions unless they are part of the problem's conditions.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"filter the unrelated informations\". The fact that Taylor expansion cannot be used is related to how to solve it, but not the problem's statement. So perhaps it's unrelated information and should be filtered out. Therefore, the formatted problem would not include that constraint.\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might have been part of the original problem's hidden conditions. Wait, perhaps the original example had a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7, but the user presented it incorrectly. Maybe I should follow the user's example structure regardless.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was stated as \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake, or the original problem had a typo. Regardless, to follow the example, perhaps any conditions mentioned or necessary should be listed as assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer (since the sum is from 1 to n).\n\n- Each a_i is a constant (real number).\n\n- x approaches infinity (though that's part of the limit).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So the first was stated in the problem, the second was perhaps a hidden condition. In our current problem, perhaps the assumption is that x is approaching infinity, but that's part of the problem's statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- For each i, a_i is a real constant.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nThe problem is to prove the limit as x approaches infinity equals the average.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a positive integer,\n\nEach a_i is a real constant.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that\n\n$$\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\left( \\frac{n}{\\frac{1}{x+a_1} + \\frac{1}{x+a_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{x+a_n}} - x \\right) = \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n}{n}.$$\n\nThe mention that Taylor expansion cannot be used is part of the original question's context but not part of the problem's mathematical statement, so it's filtered out.",
