    "Content": "So I've been trying to figure out how to prove the following. Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence of positive numbers such that $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty a_n =\\infty$, and define $s_n=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n a_i$. Then $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_n}{s_n} =\\infty$ as well. I can prove it by comparing it to $\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx $ if the sequence $a_n$ is bounded by some $M$, but that's as far as I've been able to get.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $s_n\\to+\\infty$ when $n\\to\\infty$, for each $n\\geqslant1$ there exists some finite $m\\gt n$ such that $s_m\\geqslant2s_n$. In particular, $\\sum\\limits_{k=n+1}^m\\frac{a_k}{s_k}\\geqslant\\sum\\limits_{k=n+1}^m\\frac{a_k}{s_m}=1-\\frac{s_n}{s_m}\\geqslant1/2$. Thus, the rests of the series $\\sum\\limits_k\\frac{a_k}{s_k}$ do not converge to zero, QED.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the required format. The original question is about proving that if a positive series diverges, then another related series also diverges. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that we have a sequence of positive numbers a_n, and the series sum of a_n from n=1 to infinity is divergent. Then, they define s_n as the partial sum up to n. The conclusion to prove is that the series sum of a_n/s_n also diverges.\n\nSo, looking at the example given, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's break it down.\n\n1. The first assumption is that each term a_n is positive. The original problem says \"Let (a_n) be a sequence of positive numbers.\" So that's one assumption: a_n is positive for all n.\n\n2. The series sum of a_n diverges. So, the second assumption is that the sum from n=1 to infinity of a_n is infinity.\n\n3. Then, s_n is defined as the sum from i=1 to n of a_i. So, the third assumption is that s_n equals the sum of a_i from i=1 to n for each n.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sum of a_n/s_n diverges.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, that wasn't stated. Wait, no, looking back at the example: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and another that n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Hmm, perhaps the user intended to show how to extract assumptions, but maybe in that example, they made an error. Wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but then in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to show that even if the original problem has an assumption, you need to list them. But in the case of the problem I'm working on, the assumptions are all given in the problem statement.\n\nSo, in the current problem, the user says: Let (a_n) be a sequence of positive numbers such that sum a_n diverges, and s_n is the partial sum. Then, prove sum a_n/s_n diverges. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- For all n, a_n is positive.\n\n- The series sum_{n=1}^infty a_n diverges.\n\n- For each n, s_n = sum_{i=1}^n a_i.\n\nThe problem is to prove that sum_{n=1}^infty (a_n / s_n) diverges.\n\nSo, translating this into the format: each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption: a_n is positive for all n,\n\nAssumption: The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n diverges,\n\nAssumption: s_n = ∑_{k=1}^n a_k for each n.\n\nProblem: Prove that the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (a_n / s_n) diverges.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the user included two separate assumptions about n: that it's an integer and that it's divisible by 7. But in that case, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so maybe there was a miscommunication. But perhaps the example was from a different problem. Anyway, following the instructions, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn this problem, the objects are a_n and s_n. The conditions are:\n\n1. All a_n are positive.\n\n2. The sum of a_n diverges.\n\n3. s_n is the partial sum up to n of a_n.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So the formatted problem should have those three assumptions, and the problem statement is to prove the divergence of the series a_n/s_n.",
