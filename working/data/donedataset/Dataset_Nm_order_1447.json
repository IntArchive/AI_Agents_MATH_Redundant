    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to prove that the limit of [f(x²) - f(0)]/x as x approaches 0 is 0, given that f is differentiable at 0. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what differentiability at a point means. If f is differentiable at 0, then the derivative f’(0) exists, which is the limit of [f(x) - f(0)]/x as x approaches 0. But here, instead of x, we have x² inside the function. So maybe I can make a substitution. Let’s let h = x². Then as x approaches 0, h also approaches 0. But the problem is that in the original limit, the denominator is x, not h. So substituting h = x² would give [f(h) - f(0)]/sqrt(h), but sqrt(h) is only valid for h ≥ 0, which complicates things because x can approach 0 from both sides. Hmm, maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we have x², maybe we can split the limit into two parts. Let's consider the expression [f(x²) - f(0)]/x. If we can relate this to the derivative of f at 0, which is f’(0). Let's rewrite the expression:\n\n[f(x²) - f(0)]/x = [f(x²) - f(0)]/x² * x.\n\nBecause x² is just h approaching 0 as x does. So the first part [f(x²) - f(0)]/x² is similar to the derivative definition, which would approach f’(0) as x approaches 0. Then multiplying by x, which approaches 0. So the entire limit would be f’(0) * 0 = 0. That seems right, but I need to make sure this is rigorous.\n\nWait, but when x approaches 0, x² approaches 0 from the right, so technically, the limit as x approaches 0 of [f(x²) - f(0)]/x² is actually the right-hand derivative if we consider h = x². But the problem states that f is differentiable at 0, which implies that the two-sided derivative exists. Therefore, the limit from the right (as h approaches 0+) of [f(h) - f(0)]/h is f’(0). So even though x² approaches 0 from the right, since the two-sided derivative exists, the right-hand limit is sufficient here. \n\nTherefore, breaking down the original limit:\n\nlim_{x→0} [f(x²) - f(0)]/x = lim_{x→0} [f(x²) - f(0)]/x² * x = lim_{x→0} ([f(x²) - f(0)]/x²) * lim_{x→0} x = f’(0) * 0 = 0.\n\nThis seems to work. But wait, is there any case where this might not hold? For example, if x approaches 0 from the left, x is negative, but x² is still positive. So even when x is negative, x² is positive, so the limit [f(x²) - f(0)]/x² is still approaching f’(0) because x² is approaching 0 from the right. But since f is differentiable at 0, the right-hand derivative equals the two-sided derivative, so it's okay. Then multiplying by x, which approaches 0 from both sides, but since x is going to 0, the product is still 0. So this argument holds for both x approaching 0 from the right and left.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Use the definition of differentiability. Since f is differentiable at 0, we can write f(h) = f(0) + f’(0) h + o(h) as h → 0. Then substitute h with x²:\n\nf(x²) = f(0) + f’(0) x² + o(x²) as x → 0.\n\nSubtract f(0):\n\nf(x²) - f(0) = f’(0) x² + o(x²).\n\nDivide by x:\n\n[f(x²) - f(0)]/x = f’(0) x + o(x²)/x = f’(0) x + o(x).\n\nThen take the limit as x approaches 0: both terms go to 0, so the limit is 0.\n\nThis also confirms the result. So either approach works. The key points are the differentiability at 0 allowing the use of the derivative in the limit or the expansion with the little-o notation. \n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are correctly listed. The problem states that f: R → R is differentiable at x=0. So the main assumption is that f is differentiable at 0. There are no other conditions on f mentioned, like continuity elsewhere or differentiability elsewhere. So the only assumption needed is that f is differentiable at 0. The problem is to prove the given limit is 0.\n\nWait, but in the example provided in the user's question, the assumption included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem, the user had to restructure it. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be n is an integer, but the user's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not be in the original. Wait, the example seems conflicting. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe that was a mistake? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't have n divisible by 7. Unless maybe the user made a typo. But perhaps in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the condition that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. Hmm, confusing. \n\nBut in our current problem, the user provided a Math Stack Exchange question where f: R→R is differentiable at x=0, and the task is to prove that limit is 0. So the only assumption is that f is differentiable at 0. So in the formatted problem, the assumption should be \"f is differentiable at x=0\". The problem is to prove that limit. So I need to list the assumptions correctly. \n\nThe user's example had two assumptions, but perhaps in this case, there's only one. So in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"f is differentiable at x=0\", and the problem is to prove the given limit. Therefore, following the format, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption: f is differentiable at x=0.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(x^2)-f(0)}{x}=0.$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. The key is that differentiability at 0 is given, and the problem is to show the limit. So the assumptions section lists the differentiability at 0. There's no need for other assumptions as the problem doesn't mention any other conditions on f.",
