    "Content": "(This sounds like a fairly natural question, but I couldn't find it asked on this site before…) Fix an integer $n$ as the modulus, and consider polynomials (with integer coefficients) modulo $n$ . For any polynomial $f$ and any fixed $k$ , we have $f(x) + nx^k \\equiv f(x) \\pmod n$ for all integers $x$ ; thus any two polynomials with some coefficient differing by a multiple of $n$ are equivalent in the sense that they give the same value mod $n$ for any integer $x$ as input. So we can assume that each coefficient of $f$ is one of $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\}$ . When $n$ is prime, we know (from Fermat's little theorem) that $x^n \\equiv x \\pmod n$ for all integers $x$ , which means any polynomial of degree $n$ or greater is equivalent (in the same sense as above) to a polynomial of lower degree. Even when $n$ is not prime, some such relationship probably exists; for example when $n=4$ , we can see that $x^4 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 4$ . (I guess, though this may be wrong and I haven't checked it, that if the prime factorization of $n$ is $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_r^{e_r}$ , then $x^n \\equiv x^{n/(p_1p_2\\cdots p_r)} \\pmod n$ .) In any case, whenever $x \\equiv y \\pmod n$ , we have $f(x) \\equiv f(y) \\pmod n$ , so it is enough to consider the polynomial's values at $n$ consecutive integers say $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\}$ . As there are at most $n$ distinct values it can have mod $n$ for each input $n$ , there are at most $n^n$ distinct polynomials in this sense. The question : How many distinct polynomials with integer coefficients are there mod $n$ ? Here, the meaning of \"distinct\" is that polynomials $f$ and $g$ are \"distinct\" if there exists at least one integer $x$ at which $f(x) \\not\\equiv g(x) \\pmod n$ . Or, using the terminology from what I found later (see below), we want the number of polynomial functions from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ . That is the question, but of course before asking it here I tried a few things to find the answer myself, including writing the following program. Define the \"signature\" (just a name I made up for writing this program: is there already a standard term for this?) of a polynomial $f$ as the tuple $(f(0), f(1), f(2), …, f(n-1))$ of its values at all $n$ points. We can count the number of distinct polynomials mod $n$ by keeping track of all the encountered signatures, as we start with the zero polynomial and successively add $ax^k$ for each $a$ from $0$ to $n-1$ , for increasing $k$ until $x^k$ has the same signature as some already seen polynomial. #!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n# Adding the signatures of two polynomials mod n\ndef add(t1, t2):\n    n = len(t1)\n    assert n == len(t2)\n    return tuple((t1[i] + t2[i]) % n for i in range(n))\n\ndef count(n):\n    szero = tuple([0]*n)  # The signature of the zero polynomial\n    seen = {szero}  # Only the zero polynomial has been seen\n    k = 0\n    sxk = tuple([1]*n)  # The signature of x^k\n    while True:\n        news = set()  # New signatures, by adding ax^k for some a\n        saxk = szero\n        for a in range(1, n):\n            saxk = add(saxk, sxk)  # The signature of a*(x^k)\n            for s in seen:\n                newp = add(saxk, s)  # a*(x^k) + (smaller polynomial)\n                if newp not in seen: news.add(newp)\n        seen.update(news)\n        # Now done with all polynomials of degree k\n        k += 1\n        sxk = tuple((sxk[i]*i) % n for i in range(n))\n        if sxk in seen: break\n    return len(seen)\n\nprint('n', '\\t', 'count(n)')\nfor n in range(1, 11):  # Gets very slow for n=11\n    print(n, '\\t', count(n)) This prints: n    count(n)\n1    1\n2    4\n3    27\n4    64\n5    3125\n6    108\n7    823543\n8    1024\n9    19683\n10   12500 The good thing about computing these small values is that there is the OEIS , using which you can, to quote Donald Knuth , \"compute your way into the literature\". And accordingly, searching the OEIS for this sequence $1$ , $4$ , $27$ , $64$ , $3125$ , $108$ , $823543$ , $1024$ , $19683$ gives A058067 described as \"Number of polynomial functions from Z to Z/nZ\" which is exactly our question. We also learn from that page that there's a formula $$\n\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}\n$$ that fits the numbers we computed and (per that page) was first proved by Aubrey J. Kempner in 1921 in a two-part paper called \"Polynomials and their residue systems\" ( 1 , 2 ), and by David Singmaster ( 1974 ), and there's what appears to be a nice paper in 2000 by Manjul Bhargava called \"The Factorial Function and Generalizations\" PDF that generalizes it (and maybe gives a shorter proof). But I haven't read any of these papers as I ran out of my time budget for this (well, I exceeded it by writing up this question), and I hope someone can give a clear proof/derivation of the formula either using those papers or independently. Edit : I read Bhargava's paper and understood it enough to answer this question below.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a proof based on the article by Manjul Bhargava (2000) : this article is nicely written and won a Merten M. Hasse Prize (\"for a noteworthy expository paper appearing in an Association [MAA] publication, at least one of whose authors is a younger mathematician\"). Though the paper is about a more general setting, we can restrict to the case of integers (undo the generalization!), to get a nice and illuminating proof. Lemma 1: Any integer polynomial $f$ can be written in the \"falling factorial basis\" instead of the monomial basis. In other words, if $f(x) = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^d a_k x^k$ where each $a_k$ is an integer, then we can also write $$f(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^d c_k x^{\\underline k}$$ for some integer coefficients $c_k$ , where $x^{\\underline k}$ means $x(x-1)\\cdots(x-k+1)$ . Proof: We have the expression $x^n = \\sum_k {n \\brace k} x^{\\underline k}$ where ${n \\brace k}$ is a Stirling subset number (\"Stirling number of the second kind\"), etc. See for instance Chapter 6 of the book Concrete Mathematics , or Wikipedia . $\\blacksquare$ So from now on we'll write all polynomials in this basis. Lemma 2: The polynomial $c_k x^{\\underline k}$ vanishes identically mod $n$ (meaning that $c_k x^{\\underline k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ for all integers $x$ ) if and only if $c_k k!$ is divisible by $n$ . Proof: If $c_k x^{\\underline k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ for all $x$ , then taking $x = k$ in particular gives $c_k k! \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ . For the other direction, if $c_k k!$ is divisible by $n$ , then (for any integer $x$ ) note that $x^{\\underline k}$ is a product of $k$ consecutive integers and is thus divisible by $k!$ , which means that $c_k x^{\\underline k}$ is divisible by $c_k k!$ which in turn is divisible by $n$ . $\\blacksquare$ Lemma 3 : Let $f(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^d c_k x^{\\underline k}$ . Then $f$ vanishes identically mod $n$ (meaning that $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ for all integer $x$ ) if and only if each term $c_k x^{\\underline k}$ vanishes identically mod $n$ . Proof: One direction is obvious: if each $c_k x^{\\underline k}$ vanishes identically mod $n$ , then so does their sum $f$ . For the other direction, suppose $f \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ , and let $j$ be the smallest index such that $c_j x^{\\underline j} \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ . Then, for $k < j$ we have $c_k x^{\\underline k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ by definition of $j$ , for $k > j$ , by taking $x = j$ we see that $c_k j^{\\underline k}$ includes a factor $0$ so $c_k j^{\\underline k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ . As $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ , this means (still looking at $x=j$ ) that the only remaining term $c_j j^{\\underline j} \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ as well, i.e. $c_j j!$ is divisible by $n$ . This from Lemma 2 means that $c_j x^{\\underline j} \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ for all $x$ . $\\blacksquare$ Lemma 4: $c_k k!$ is divisible by $n$ if and only if $\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$ divides $c_k$ . Proof: A special case of \"If $a$ divides $bc$ , then $a/gcd(a,b)$ divides $c$ \", which can be proved in many ways, say using the unique prime factorization. $\\blacksquare$ This leads to a theorem characterizing all the polynomial functions mod $n$ : Theorem: Any polynomial function $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ can be expressed uniquely in the form $$f(x) = \\sum_k c_k x^{\\underline k} \\qquad\\text{ where }0 \\le c_k < \\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}.$$ Proof: By the previous lemmas, note that changing one of the coefficients $c_k$ by a multiple of $\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$ means adding a term which vanishes identically mod $n$ , and thus does not change the function $f$ . This means that each of the coefficients $c_k$ is determined only modulo $\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$ . $\\blacksquare$ (Note that this is essentially a \"structure theorem\" for the abelian group (under addition) of polynomial functions mod $n$ .) Finally, as there are $\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$ choices for each coefficient $c_k$ , the number of distinct polynomial functions modulo $n$ is $$\\prod_k \\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$$ Edit. Here's another proof I came up with, that's more computational and less \"magic\". It came up while trying to enumerate all possible \"signatures\" $(f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(n-1))$ . Specifically, suppose we are given a \"signature\" $(y_0, y_1, \\ldots y_{n-1})$ and want to find a polynomial (or all polynomials) $f$ such that $f(0) \\equiv y_0$ and $f(1) \\equiv y_1$ and so on (all congruences are modulo $n$ ). By Lemma 1 from the proof above, we can suppose that the polynomial we are trying to find has been written in the basis of \"falling factorial powers\" $x^{\\underline k}$ , where $x^{\\underline k}$ means $x(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-k+1)$ . That is, we can suppose that the polynomial we want is $$f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^{\\underline 2} + c_3 x^{\\underline 3} + \\ldots,$$ where we are trying to solve for the coefficients $c_0, c_1, \\dots$ . This we can do iteratively, by considering the given values of $f(0), f(1), \\dots$ in order: $f(0) = y_0$ is the same as $c_0 \\equiv y_0$ , which can always be \"solved\" for $c_0$ , i.e. just set $c_0 \\equiv y_0$ . Having thus determined $c_0$ , the next equation we were given, namely $f(1) = y_1$ , is now the same as $c_0 + c_1 \\equiv y_1$ or equivalently $c_1 \\equiv y_1 - c_0$ which can always be solved for $c_1$ , as $c_0$ is known. Next, $f(2) = y_2$ is the same as $c_0 + 2c_1 + 2c_2 \\equiv y_2$ or equivalently $2c_2 \\equiv y_2 - c_0 - 2c_1$ which (now that we have determined $c_0$ and $c_1$ ) can be solved for $c_2$ except in one case: if $n$ is even and the RHS is odd, then our congruence $2c_2 = \\text{(an odd number)} \\pmod n$ is impossible. So we need to impose a condition, namely: if $n$ is even then $y_2$ must be such that the RHS is also even. When $n$ is odd, any value mod $n$ will do for $y_2$ , but when $n$ is even only half the values mod $n$ will do for $y_2$ . In short, there are $\\dfrac{n}{\\gcd(n, 2)}$ values for $y_2$ for which we can find $c_2$ to satisfy $f(2) = y_2$ . Next, $f(3) = y_3$ is the same as $c_0 + 3c_1 + 6c_2 + 6c_3 \\equiv y_3$ or equivalently $6c_3 \\equiv y_3 - …$ which can be solved for $c_3$ , for $\\dfrac{n}{\\gcd(n, 6)}$ values of $y_3$ . And so on: in general $f(k) = y_k$ is the same as $k!c_k \\equiv y_k - …$ which can be solved (for $c_k$ ) for $\\dfrac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$ values of $y_k$ . So the number of $(y_0, y_1, \\ldots)$ that can possibly be the signatures of a polynomial (and thus also the number of polynomial functions) is: $$\\prod_{k \\ge 0} \\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$$ (Deep down there are of course some similarities between this proof and the previous one, but at least this version is something I could imagine having come up with by myself, with only the falling factorial basis idea.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure the problem according to the given format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the original question. The user is asking about the number of distinct polynomial functions modulo n. The key points here are:\n\n1. The modulus is an integer n.\n2. Polynomials have integer coefficients.\n3. Two polynomials are considered equivalent if they produce the same value mod n for all integer inputs x.\n4. Coefficients can be reduced modulo n, so each coefficient is in {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n5. When n is prime, Fermat's little theorem allows reducing the degree, but for composite n, similar reductions might exist.\n6. The problem mentions that it's sufficient to consider polynomials evaluated at n consecutive integers (like 0 to n-1) because f(x) ≡ f(y) mod n if x ≡ y mod n.\n7. The user references a formula involving the product of n divided by gcd(n, k!) for k from 0 to n-1.\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property. Let me parse the original question again.\n\n- The modulus n is an integer.\n- Polynomials have integer coefficients.\n- Polynomials are considered equivalent if they agree on all integer inputs modulo n.\n- Each coefficient of the polynomial is in {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n- The problem considers polynomial functions from Z to Z/nZ.\n- The number of distinct polynomials is given by the product formula mentioned.\n\nWait, the problem states that after coefficient reduction, we still have to account for possible equivalences due to relations like x^n ≡ x mod n for primes. So another assumption is that there exist degree-reduction identities depending on n's factorization.\n\nBut the main problem is to count the number of distinct polynomial functions mod n. The user found a formula and wants to derive it.\n\nSo for the assumptions:\n\n- n is a fixed integer modulus.\n- Two polynomials f and g are equivalent modulo n if f(x) ≡ g(x) mod n for all integers x.\n- Coefficients of polynomials are considered modulo n (so each coefficient is in {0, 1, ..., n-1}).\n- Polynomial functions are determined by their values on the residues {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n- The number of distinct polynomial functions modulo n is given by the product formula ∏_{k=0}^{n-1} n / gcd(n, k!).\n\nBut the problem is to determine how many distinct polynomial functions there are, which is answered by that product formula. So the assumptions should capture the conditions given in the problem.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"How many 'distinct' polynomial functions are there mod n?\" and in the body, they define equivalence as differing by multiples of n in coefficients, but also note that due to congruence relations (like x^n ≡ x mod n for primes), higher-degree terms can be reduced. However, the answer involves the product formula.\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n- The modulus is an integer n.\n- Polynomials are considered equivalent if they induce the same function from Z to Z/nZ.\n- The problem is to count the number of such distinct polynomial functions.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, they listed assumptions like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, in the problem, n is given as an integer modulus, but there's no specific divisibility condition unless the formula has some implicit conditions.\n\nWait, the original example had the user mentioning that n could be prime or composite. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- Polynomial functions are considered over the integers modulo n.\n- Two polynomials are equivalent if they produce the same function modulo n.\n\nBut the formula given is general for any n. So perhaps the assumptions are just that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to find the number of distinct polynomial functions from Z to Z/nZ, which is given by the product formula.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nPolynomials have integer coefficients,\nTwo polynomials are equivalent modulo n if they produce the same function from Z to Z/nZ,\nCoefficients of polynomials are reduced modulo n to the set {0, 1, ..., n-1},\nThe number of distinct polynomial functions is determined by their values on {0, 1, ..., n-1},\nThere exists a product formula for the number of distinct polynomial functions modulo n.\n\nWait, but the product formula is part of the problem's answer, not an assumption. The problem is to find the number, which the user states is given by that product. However, the original question is asking for a proof/derivation of that formula. Therefore, the problem should be to prove that formula.\n\nLooking back at the original problem's text: The user writes \"The question: How many distinct polynomials with integer coefficients are there mod n?\" and later mentions the formula. So the problem is to find the number, and the answer is that formula. Thus, the problem is to prove that the number of distinct polynomial functions is equal to the product from k=0 to n-1 of n/gcd(n, k!).\n\nSo the assumptions would be the necessary conditions for that formula to hold. However, the formula is general for any positive integer n. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- Polynomial functions are considered equivalent if they agree modulo n for all integer inputs.\n- Coefficients are reduced modulo n.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. Maybe other implicit assumptions from the problem's context:\n\n- The polynomial functions are from Z to Z/nZ.\n- Two polynomials are equivalent if they induce the same function.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nPolynomials have integer coefficients,\nTwo polynomials are equivalent modulo n if they agree on all integer inputs,\nCoefficients are reduced modulo n to {0, 1, ..., n-1},\nThe number of distinct polynomial functions is determined by their evaluations at {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n\nBut maybe these are more detailed than needed. The problem is asking for the count, which is given by the product formula. So the problem statement is: \"How many distinct polynomials with integer coefficients are there mod n?\" where \"distinct\" means they differ in at least one integer input modulo n.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have assumptions that n is a positive integer, polynomials with integer coefficients considered modulo n, and equivalence is functional equivalence. The problem is to prove that the number is the given product.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nPolynomials are considered as functions from integers to integers modulo n,\nTwo polynomials are equivalent if they produce the same function modulo n.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of distinct polynomial functions from integers to integers modulo n is $$\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$$.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption was more specific, like \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is general for any positive integer n, so the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. The rest are part of the problem's setup.\n\nBut the original user's problem statement includes the modulus n, polynomials with integer coefficients, equivalence defined by agreement on all inputs mod n, coefficients reduced mod n, and values determined by residues 0 to n-1. However, the problem is to find the count, which the formula provides. So the key assumptions are n being a positive integer and the equivalence relation. The rest are part of the problem's context but not assumptions per se.\n\nSo after considering, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- Polynomials with integer coefficients are considered modulo n.\n- Two polynomials are equivalent if they yield the same function from Z to Z/nZ.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the problem's specific conditions. Here, the problem is more general, so the main assumption is n being a positive integer, and the equivalence as functional equivalence.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nPolynomials are considered as functions from integers to integers modulo n,\nTwo polynomials are equivalent if they produce the same function modulo n.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of distinct polynomial functions is $$\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$$.\n\nBut looking back at the user's example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, in this problem, the user is not specifying any particular condition on n other than it being an integer modulus. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nPolynomials have integer coefficients,\nTwo polynomials are equivalent modulo n if they agree on all integer inputs.\n\nProblem: How many distinct polynomial functions from integers to integers modulo n are there?\n\nWait, but the user already knows the answer is the product formula. So the problem is to prove that formula. Therefore, the problem statement in the formatted version should be to prove the formula.\n\nThe original problem's title is \"How many 'distinct' polynomials functions are there mod $n$?\", and the user mentions they found the formula via OEIS and references. Therefore, the formatted problem should request proving that formula.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with assumptions listed. Here, the problem is to prove that the number of polynomial functions is equal to the product formula.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nPolynomial functions are considered modulo n,\nTwo polynomial functions are equivalent if they agree on all integer inputs.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of distinct polynomial functions from integers to integers modulo n is $$\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$$.\n\nBut the original problem mentions that coefficients can be reduced modulo n, so maybe that's an assumption. However, in the user's example, assumptions were about properties of objects in the problem. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nPolynomial coefficients are integers considered modulo n,\nPolynomial functions are equivalent if they agree modulo n for all integer inputs.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of distinct polynomial functions from integers to integers modulo n is given by $$\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{n}{\\gcd(n, k!)}$$.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property. The first is about n, the second about coefficients, the third about equivalence. Then the problem is to prove the formula.",
