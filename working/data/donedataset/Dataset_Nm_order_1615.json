    "Content": "For example, let's take the polynomial $$x^8-x^7+x^2-x+15$$ Here, the power ( $n=8$ ) is even so it can have real roots or it might not have real roots. Something which I thought was to find the minima and show that if the minima of $p(x)$ is greater than $0$ and $a_1$ that is the coefficient of $x^8$ are both greater than $0$ then we cannot have real roots . But in this case the derivative is $8x^7-7x^6+2x-1$ and I cannot find minima for it . So what should I do in this example? Well it is already given this polynomial does not have real roots, but I have to prove it. Also even if I get that this does not have any real roots then is this a general method for all kinds of polynomials? Edit: I know Strum's theorem is one general way to solve such questions but this question is from an undergrad entrance paper and I guess a method under the reach of calculus or something similar will suffice better.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Clearly there is no negative root as all terms are positive for $x < 0$.  The question remains if there are positive roots.  Here is a simple way which often works. Case 1: $0 < x <1$. $$P(x) = (15-x) + (x^2-x^7) + x^8 > 0$$ \nas each term is positive. Case 2: $ x > 1$. Similarly\n$$P(x) = (x^8-x^7) + (x^2-x) + 15 > 0$$ as $x=1$ is not a root, we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the polynomial \\( x^8 - x^7 + x^2 - x + 15 \\) does not have real roots. The user also mentions that methods within the reach of calculus are preferred, not something advanced like Sturm's theorem.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The problem is about a specific polynomial. Let me list the assumptions:\n\n1. The polynomial in question is \\( p(x) = x^8 - x^7 + x^2 - x + 15 \\).\n2. The problem requires proving that this polynomial has no real roots.\n3. The method should be accessible with calculus or similar undergrad-level math.\n\nWait, but the user also mentions that the derivative is \\( 8x^7 - 7x^6 + 2x - 1 \\) and that they couldn't find minima for it. Maybe that's part of their attempt, but the assumptions should focus on the problem's given conditions. The derivative is part of their approach, not an assumption of the problem itself. So perhaps the assumptions are just about the polynomial and the requirement to show no real roots.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions listed were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the main object is the polynomial, so the assumption is the polynomial's form. The problem is to prove it has no real roots.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The polynomial is \\( p(x) = x^8 - x^7 + x^2 - x + 15 \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that this specific polynomial has no real roots. The user also mentions that the coefficient of \\( x^8 \\) (which is 1) is positive. Maybe that's part of the analysis but not an assumption. The problem's assumptions are the given polynomial and possibly that we are considering real roots. However, since the problem is to show no real roots, perhaps the only assumption is the polynomial itself.\n\nWait, in the example, they listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the polynomial is given, so the assumption is just the polynomial's definition. The problem is to prove it has no real roots. So:\n\nAssumption: The polynomial is \\( p(x) = x^8 - x^7 + x^2 - x + 15 \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( p(x) \\) does not have real roots.\n\nBut the user also mentioned that the derivative is complicated. However, that's part of their attempt, not an assumption. So the formatted problem should include the polynomial as the assumption and the problem statement.\n\nWait, the example included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. In this case, the polynomial is the only assumption. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( p(x) = x^8 - x^7 + x^2 - x + 15 \\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( p(x) \\) does not have real roots.\n\nBut the user's original problem might have other implicit conditions. For instance, the polynomial is defined over the reals, but that's standard. The example didn't mention the domain, so perhaps it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that we are to consider real roots, but that's implied by the problem statement. So the formatted problem should be as above.",
