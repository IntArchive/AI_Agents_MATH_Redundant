    "Content": "How do you prove that the Sobolev space $H^s(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is an algebra if $s>\\frac{n}{2}$, i.e. if $u,v$ are in $H^s(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, then so is $uv$? Actually I think we should also have $\\lVert uv\\rVert_s \\leq C \\lVert u\\rVert_s \\lVert v\\rVert_s$. Recall that $\\lVert f\\rVert_s=\\lVert(1+|\\eta|^2)^{s/2}\\,\\hat{f}(\\eta)\\rVert$, the norm on $H^s(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. This is an exercise from Taylor's book, Partial differential equations I.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the Sobolev space H^s(R^n) is an algebra when s > n/2. The user also mentions that the norm involves the Fourier transform and wants the inequality ||uv||_s ≤ C||u||_s ||v||_s.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The Sobolev space in question is H^s(ℝ^n). So the first assumption is that we're working in H^s(ℝ^n).\n2. The condition given is that 2s > n, which is equivalent to s > n/2. So the second assumption is s > n/2.\n3. The elements u and v are in H^s(ℝ^n). That's two separate assumptions: u ∈ H^s(ℝ^n) and v ∈ H^s(ℝ^n).\n4. The norm is defined using the Fourier transform: ||f||_s = ||(1 + |η|²)^(s/2) ȳf(η)||, which refers to the L² norm of the weighted Fourier transform. So another assumption is the norm definition as given.\n\nWait, but the problem statement might not need to repeat the norm definition as an assumption since it's part of the standard definition of H^s. But the user mentions it, so maybe include it. However, in the example provided, assumptions were about the variables and conditions on them. So perhaps the norm definition is part of the problem's given context, not an assumption. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had A(n) defined, and the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. The problem part restated the expression to prove. So in this case, the norm definition is part of the problem's setup, not an assumption. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- s is a real number such that s > n/2 (or 2s > n, same thing).\n- u and v are elements of H^s(ℝ^n).\n- The norm ||·||_s is defined as the L² norm of (1 + |η|²)^{s/2} times the Fourier transform.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that H^s is an algebra under these conditions, meaning that the product uv is also in H^s, and the inequality holds. So the assumptions would list the conditions on s, the space, and the functions u and v.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions line by line:\n\nAssumption:\ns is a real number,\ns > n/2,\nu is an element of H^s(ℝ^n),\nv is an element of H^s(ℝ^n),\nThe norm ||f||_s is defined as ||(1 + |η|²)^{s/2} \\hat{f}(η)||_{L²(ℝ^n)}.\n\nProblem: Prove that H^s(ℝ^n) is an algebra, i.e., uv is in H^s(ℝ^n), and there exists a constant C such that ||uv||_s ≤ C ||u||_s ||v||_s.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"H^s is an algebra if s > n/2\", so maybe the key assumptions are s > n/2 and u, v ∈ H^s. The norm definition is part of the problem's context. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. The problem part restated the expression to prove. So here, the main assumptions are s > n/2 and u, v ∈ H^s. The norm is part of the problem's definition.\n\nSo revised assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\ns is a real number,\ns > n/2,\nu is an element of H^s(ℝ^n),\nv is an element of H^s(ℝ^n).\n\nProblem: Prove that the product uv is also in H^s(ℝ^n) and that there exists a constant C such that ||uv||_s ≤ C ||u||_s ||v||_s.\n\nThe norm is part of the problem statement because it's specified in the original question. The user mentions \"Recall that ||f||_s=||(1+|η|²)^{s/2} \\hat{f}(η)||...\". So perhaps the norm's definition is part of the problem's restatement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions on s, u, v, and the problem part includes the norm as part of what needs to be proven.",
