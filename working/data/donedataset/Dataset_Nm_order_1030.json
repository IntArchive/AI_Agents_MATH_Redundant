    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe question is about proving the recurrence relation for Hermite polynomials: H_{n+1}(x) = 2xH_n(x) - 2nH_{n-1}(x). The user tried starting with the Rodrigues formula, took the first derivative, and ended up with H_{n+1}(x) = 2xH_n(x) - H_n'(x). But they're stuck on showing that H_n'(x) = 2nH_{n-1}(x).\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem involves Hermite polynomials defined via Rodrigues' formula: H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²}. The user is using this definition and taking derivatives. The key assumptions here are about the properties of the Hermite polynomials as per Rodrigues' formula and their derivatives.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that H_n(x) is defined by that Rodrigues formula. Then, when taking the derivative, they used the product rule, leading to the expression involving H_n'(x). The main issue is connecting H_n'(x) to H_{n-1}(x), so another assumption might be the relationship between the derivative of H_n and H_{n-1}.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So:\n\n1. H_n(x) is defined by the Rodrigues formula: H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²}\n2. The derivative of H_n(x) with respect to x is considered (as part of the process)\n3. The goal is to relate H_n'(x) to H_{n-1}(x)\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the original question is to prove the recurrence relation H_{n+1}(x) = 2xH_n(x) - 2nH_{n-1}(x). The user has derived up to H_{n+1}(x) = 2xH_n(x) - H_n'(x) and is stuck on showing H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}.\n\nSo the core problem now is to prove that the derivative of H_n(x) is 2n H_{n-1}(x). That seems to be the missing link here.\n\nSo structuring this, the main problem is to show H_n'(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x), which would then allow the recurrence relation to be proven. The assumptions would be the definition of Hermite polynomials via Rodrigues formula and the steps taken so far.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list:\n\n- H_n(x) is defined by the Rodrigues formula: (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²}\n- The recurrence relation H_{n+1}(x) = 2xH_n(x) - H_n'(x) has been derived\n- The user needs to show that H_n'(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x)\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, assumptions are conditions or properties applied to one object. So perhaps each assumption is a separate condition. Let's check the example again:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer\n- n is divisible by 7\n\nBut in the original problem, n is just any integer, but the assumption added was that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem was that the user had to prove divisibility by 91, but in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that example was incorrect? Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user had a different original problem. Hmm, maybe there was a miscommunication in the example.\n\nBut regardless, according to the user's example, the assumptions are supposed to list all the conditions given in the problem, each as a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the Hermite polynomials are defined via Rodrigues formula. The user is using the derivative of that formula. The key steps they did are:\n\n1. Start with Rodrigues formula: H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²}\n\n2. Take derivative of H_n(x):\n\nd/dx H_n(x) = (-1)^n [2x e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²} + e^{x²} d^{n+1}/dx^{n+1} e^{-x²}]\n\nThen rearranged to get H_{n+1}(x) = 2x H_n(x) - d/dx H_n(x), i.e., H_{n+1}(x) = 2x H_n(x) - H_n'(x)\n\nBut the user can't see how H_n'(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x). So the problem now is to prove H_n'(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x). Therefore, the problem as presented in the question is to show that derivative equals 2n H_{n-1}(x).\n\nBut the original problem was to prove the recurrence relation. However, the user's specific issue is at the step where they need to connect H_n' to H_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should capture the exact problem the user is stuck on. The user's problem is now: How to show that H_n'(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x)?\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- H_n(x) is defined by Rodrigues formula: H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²}\n\n- The derivative of H_n(x) is expressed as H_n'(x) = (-1)^n [2x e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²} + e^{x²} d^{n+1}/dx^{n+1} e^{-x²}]\n\n- The recurrence relation H_{n+1}(x) = 2x H_n(x) - H_n'(x) has been derived\n\nBut perhaps to structure it according to the example, each assumption is a single condition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- H_n(x) is defined by the Rodrigues formula: H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²}\n\n- The derivative of H_n(x) is calculated as \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) = (-1)^n [2x e^{x²} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²} + e^{x²} \\frac{d^{n+1}}{dx^{n+1}} e^{-x²}]\n\n- The recurrence relation H_{n+1}(x) = 2x H_n(x) - \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) is established\n\nProblem: Show that \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is still to prove the original recurrence relation, but the user is stuck on showing H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}, so maybe the problem is to prove the recurrence relation, given that H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}.\n\nBut according to the user's question, they have already derived H_{n+1} = 2x H_n - H_n', but need to show H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}.\n\nTherefore, the problem as per the user's current step is to prove H_n'(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x), given the Rodrigues formula.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the Rodrigues formula and the existing steps, and the problem is to show the derivative relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main problem is still the original recurrence, but the specific step needed is to show H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}.\n\nBut the user's exact question is \"I don't know how to show that H_n' (x)=2nH_{n-1} (x). Can you help me?\"\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that H_n'(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x), given the assumptions from the Rodrigues formula and the previous steps.\n\nSo, putting this all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Hermite polynomials H_n(x) are defined by the Rodrigues formula: H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²}\n\n- The derivative of H_n(x) is computed as \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) = (-1)^n [2x e^{x²} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²} + e^{x²} \\frac{d^{n+1}}{dx^{n+1}} e^{-x²}]\n\n- The recurrence relation H_{n+1}(x) = 2x H_n(x) - \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) has been derived\n\nProblem: Show that \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x)\n\nBut maybe some of these assumptions are redundant. For example, the derivative computation is part of the process, but maybe the key assumption is the Rodrigues formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more succinct: given the Rodrigues formula for H_n(x), show that its derivative is 2n H_{n-1}(x).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption: H_n(x) is defined by H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²}\n\nAssumption: The derivative \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) is calculated as (-1)^n [2x e^{x²} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²} + e^{x²} \\frac{d^{n+1}}{dx^{n+1}} e^{-x²}]\n\nAssumption: The recurrence relation H_{n+1}(x) = 2x H_n(x) - \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) is derived\n\nProblem: Show that \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x)\n\nBut the user might not have stated all these as assumptions, but they are part of the process. However, according to the instructions, we need to filter unrelated information and list assumptions. The key starting point is the Rodrigues formula. The rest might be part of the problem-solving process, but the main assumption is the definition of H_n(x). The problem is to show that H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only assumption needed is the Rodrigues formula, and the problem is to derive H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: Hermite polynomials are defined by H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²}\n\nProblem: Show that the derivative of H_n(x) is \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x)\n\nThis seems more aligned with the example, where the main assumption is the definition, and the problem is to show the derivative relation.\n\nBut the user also mentions that they have derived H_{n+1} = 2x H_n - H_n', so maybe that is part of the assumptions? Wait, in the example, they included the divisibility by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That might have been an error. However, in this case, the user's problem is after deriving up to H_{n+1} = 2x H_n - H_n', and now needs to show H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is not just to show H_n' = 2n H_{n-1} in isolation, but as part of proving the original recurrence relation. However, the user's specific question is about showing H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}.\n\nSo, to follow the example's structure, which filtered the original problem into the assumption and problem. The original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, but the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems odd. Wait, perhaps the example was from a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7? Maybe the example is not correctly formatted. But regardless, the instruction is to filter unrelated information and list assumptions.\n\nIn the given problem, the user is using the Rodrigues formula and derived up to a certain point, but needs to connect H_n' to H_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the key assumption here is the definition of H_n(x) via Rodrigues formula. The problem is to show that its derivative is 2n H_{n-1}(x).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: Hermite polynomials are defined by H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²}\n\nProblem: Show that the derivative of H_n(x) is \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x)\n\nYes, this seems to capture the core of the user's question. The user's problem is to prove the derivative relation, given the Rodrigues formula. The other steps they did (calculating the derivative and rearranging) are part of their attempt but not necessarily assumptions. The main assumption is the definition.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless there was a misunderstanding. However, perhaps the example was a bad one, but we should follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn this case, the user's problem is to prove that H_n' = 2n H_{n-1}, given that H_n is defined by Rodrigues formula. Therefore, the assumption is the Rodrigues formula, and the problem is to show the derivative.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: Hermite polynomials are defined by H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} \\frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x²}\n\nProblem: Show that \\frac{d}{dx} H_n(x) = 2n H_{n-1}(x)\n\nThis seems to fit the required format, filtering out the intermediate steps the user took and focusing on the core assumption and the problem they need to solve.",
