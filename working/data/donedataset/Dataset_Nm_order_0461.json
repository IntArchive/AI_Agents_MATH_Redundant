    "Content": "My math teacher left two questions last week, prove (1) $6^9>10^7$ and (2) $7^{71}>75^{32}.$ I did the first question: \\begin{align}\\frac{6^9}{10^7}&=\\frac{4}{5}\\times\\frac{27^3}{25^3}\\\\&=0.8\\times1.08^3\\\\&>0.8\\times(1+3\\times0.08+3\\times0.08^2)\\\\&>0.8\\times(1+3\\times0.086)\\\\&>0.8\\times1.25=1.\\end{align} But I can't work out the second,  I calculated it out on my computer, $\\frac{7^{71}}{75^{32}}=1.000000949\\cdots$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will give a solution that involve only calculations with 2 digit numbers; all the other contributions will be estimated. I will call my approach the sloppy continued fractions method. Unluckily, if you want to cut down computations you have to be smarter, and in particular lengthy. Sorry for that, but you will enjoy! After the theoretical framework is set up, the problem is easy to understand, but if you prefer you can skip to the \"out of the blue\" section at the bottom. Theory Firstly, notice that the problem can be reformulated as $\\log_7(75) < \\frac{71}{32}$ . The instance of finding good rational approximants to irrational numbers is a classical one, and it is addressed by the continued fractions method. In case of logarithms and inequalities, it has the following simpler form. Say we want to understand whether $\\log_a(b) < \\frac{p}{q}$ . Then: Take the maximum integer $n_0$ less than $\\log_a(b)$ , i.e. solve $a^{n_0} < b < a^{n_0+1} $ , and let $m_0$ be the maximum integer less than $p/q$ . If $m_0 \\ge n_0 +1$ the inequality is true, because $$\\frac{p}{q} \\ge m_0 \\ge n_0 +1 \\ge \\log_a(b) $$ Else, if $n_0 \\ge m_0 +1$ the inequality is false, because $$ \\frac{p}{q} \\le m_0 +1 \\le n_0 \\le \\log_a(b) $$ Otherwise, go to step 3 supposing $n_0 = m_0$ . Since $\\log_a(b) - n_0 = \\log_a(b/a^{n_0})$ is less than one, we can write $$ \\log_a(b) = n_0+ \\frac{1}{\\log_{a_1}(b_1) } $$ where $a_1 = b/a^{n_0}, b_1 = a$ . Analogously we can write $$ \\frac{p}{q} = n_0 + \\frac{1}{ \\frac{p_1}{q_1} } $$ where $p_1 = q, q_1 = p-n_0 q$ . Now we reformulate the inequality and we get $$ n_0 + \\frac{1}{\\log_{a_1}(b_1) } < n_0 + \\frac{p-n_0 q}{q} $$ $$ \\log_{a_1}(b_1) > \\frac{p_1}{q_1} $$ And we can repeat from step 1 with a similar problem (but sign reversed). There is a little problem: while the fraction gets simpler at step (5), the numbers involved in logarithms becomes harder. Let me state a little lemma. Logarithm approximation. Let $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $k,j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ small with respect to $\\alpha, \\beta$ . Then if $x = k/\\alpha, y = j/\\beta$ : $$ 1+\\frac{1}{\\ln(\\alpha/\\beta)} (x -y -(x^2+y^2)) <  \\log_{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} (\\frac{\\alpha+k}{\\beta+j} )  < 1+\\frac{1}{\\ln(\\alpha/\\beta)} (x-y +(x^2+y^2))$$ Proof. This is a simple consequence of $ x-x^2 \\le \\ln(1+x) \\le x+x^2$ . Also, depending on the sign of $k,j$ and the inequality that must be used, sometimes the quadratic term is not necessary (indeed $\\log(1+x) \\le x$ for positive $x$ and $\\log(1+x) \\ge x$ for negative $x$ ). Now let me restate the continued fraction method with a sloppiness parameter. We want to solve inequalities of the form $\\log_a (b) < \\frac{p}{q} \\cdot \\alpha$ , where $\\alpha \\simeq 1 $ is a rational number (the approximation parameter). The bad thing is that it can stop at some time because of our sloppiness, but if it doesn't stop it works with few digits!! Also, don't worry if you can't follow the exact formulas, because they will get explicit thereafter. Take the maximum integer $n_0$ less than $\\log_a(b)$ , i.e. solve $a^{n_0} < b < a^{n_0+1} $ , and let $m_0$ be the maximum integer less than $p/q$ . If If $\\alpha m_0 \\ge n_0 +1$ the inequality is true, because $$\\alpha\\frac{p}{q} \\ge \\alpha m_0 \\ge n_0 +1 \\ge \\log_a(b) $$ Else, if $n_0 \\ge \\alpha (m_0 +1)$ the inequality is false, because $$ \\alpha \\frac{p}{q} \\le \\alpha(m_0 +1) \\le n_0 \\le \\log_a(b) $$ Else, if $n_0 = m_0$ go to step 3.\nIn any other case, return \"YOU HAVE BEEN TOO SLOPPY! TRY AGAIN!\". Since $\\log_a(b) - n_0 = \\log_a(b/a^{n_0})$ is less than one, we can write $$ \\log_a(b) = n_0+ \\frac{1}{\\log_{a_1}(b_1) } $$ where $a_1 = b/a^{n_0}, b_1 = a$ . Analogously we can write $$ \\alpha \\frac{p}{q} - n_0 = \\alpha(n_0 + \\frac{q_1}{p_1} ) - n_0  = (\\alpha -1)n_0 + \\alpha \\frac{q_1}{p_1} = \\frac{q_1}{p_1} ( \\alpha + \\frac{p_1}{q_1} n_0 (\\alpha-1) )= \\frac{1}{ \\alpha_1 \\frac{p_1}{q_1} } $$ where $p_1 = q, q_1 = p-n_0 q, \\alpha_1 = \\left (  \\alpha + \\frac{p_1}{q_1} n_0 (\\alpha-1) \\right )^{-1} $ . Now we reformulate the inequality and we get $$ n_0 + \\frac{1}{\\log_{a_1}(b_1) } < n_0 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha_1 \\frac{p_1}{q_1} }  $$ $$ \\log_{a_1}(b_1) > \\alpha_1 \\frac{p_1}{q_1} $$ If we want to, we can approximate a bit the logarithm on the left using the logarithm approximation and move this contribution in $\\alpha_1$ . Then we can repeat from step 1 with a similar problem (but reversed inequality). Calculations Let's start! At the beginning $a=7, b= 75, p=71, q=32, \\alpha=1$ . Also, let me notice that the continued fraction of $71/32$ is $[2,4,1,1,3]$ , that is: $$ \\frac{71}{32} = 2+\\frac{1}{4+\\frac{1}{1+ \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{3}}}} $$ Since we suspect this approximations is really close, probably the continued fraction of the logarithm will be the same for a lot of time, so that we have a guess of what the \" $n_0$ \" should be. STEP 1 1.1 Note that $7^2 < 75 < 7^3$ , so that $n_0 = 2= m_0$ and we go to point 3. 1.3 We have $a_1 = 75/49, b_1 = 7, p_1 = 32, q_1 = 71 - 64 = 7$ . The inequality is now $$ \\log_{75/49} (7) > \\frac{32}{7}$$ here it is a trick we will use repeatedly: $$ \\log_{75/49}(7) = \\color{red}{\\log_{75/49}(75/50)}\\log_{75/50}(7) > \\color{red}{\\left(1- \\frac{1}{50} \\right)} \\log_{3/2}(7) = \\frac{49}{50} \\log_{3/2}(7) $$ 1.5 It is enough to verify that something smaller than LHS is greater than RHS, and we get the sloppy inequality $$ \\log_{3/2}(7)  > \\frac{50}{49} \\frac{32}{7} $$ STEP 2 2.1 The suggestion from the continued fraction of 32/7 makes us try $n_1 = 4$ , and indeed $$ 3^4 = 81 < 112 = 7 \\cdot 16 = 7 \\cdot 2^4, \\ \\ \\ 3^5 = 343 > 7 \\cdot 32 $$ 2.3 Formulas yield $a_2 = 112/81 , b_2 = 3/2, p_2 = 7, q_2 = 4$ and $$\\alpha_2 = \\left ( \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{7}{4} \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{49}\\right)^{-1} = \\left ( \\frac{57}{49} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{49}{57} $$ The inequality is now $$ \\log_{112/81} (3/2) < \\frac{7}{4} \\frac{49}{57}$$ and the log trick yields $$ \\log_{112/81}(3/2) = \\log_{112/81}(110/80) \\log_{11/8}(3/2) < \\left ( 1-\\frac{2}{112} + \\frac{1}{81} \\right ) \\log_{11/8}(3/2) <  \\log_{11/8}(3/2)$$ 2.5 The sloppy inequality remains $$ \\log_{11/8} (3/2) < \\frac{7}{4} \\frac{49}{57} $$ STEP 3 3.1 Under the usual suggestion we try $n_2 = 1$ and it works: $$ \\frac{11}{8} = 1+ \\frac{3}{11} < 1+ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{11^2}{8^2} = \\left( 1+ \\frac{3}{11} \\right)^2 > 1+ \\frac{6}{11} > \\frac{3}{2}  $$ 3.3 We get $p_3 =4, q_3 = 3, a_3 = 24/22 = 12/11,  b_3 = 11/8$ and $$ \\alpha_3 =  \\left (  \\frac{49}{57} -\\frac{4}{3} \\frac{9}{57} \\right )^{-1} = \\frac{57}{37} $$ 3.5 The fraction $12/11$ is nice, so we don't do the trick at this step. The sloppy inequality is just $$ \\log_{12/11}( 11/8) > \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{57}{37} $$ STEP 4. 4.1 Here it is the surprise: using the rule for the cube of a sum we have that $$ \\left  ( 1 + \\frac{1}{11} \\right) ^3 = 1 + \\frac{3}{11} + \\frac{3}{11^2} + \\frac{1}{11^3}  < 1 + \\frac{3}{11} + \\frac{10}{121} + \\frac{11}{11^3} = \\frac{15}{11} < \\frac{11}{8}$$ because $15 \\cdot 8 = 120 < 121 = 11^2$ . This translates into $\\log_{12/11}(11/8) \\ge 3$ . On the other side $$ \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{57}{37} < \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{60}{36} = \\frac{20}{9} < 3 \\le \\log_{12/11}(11/8) $$ And we are done. Victory! Yey! Out of the blue Let's start from the observation that $$ (\\#1) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\left ( \\frac{12}{11} \\right ) ^3 = \\left (1+ \\frac{1}{11} \\right ) ^3 = $$ $$ =1+ \\frac{3}{11} +\\frac{3}{11^2} +\\frac{1}{11^3} \\le 1+ \\frac{3}{11} + \\frac{10}{11^2} + \\frac{11}{11^3} $$ $$  = \\frac{15}{11} < \\frac{11}{8} $$ So that $\\log_{12/11}(11/8) > 3$ . Also, note that $$ (\\#2) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\    3 > \\frac{20}{9} = \\frac{60}{36} \\frac{4}{3} > \\frac{57}{37} \\frac{4}{3} $$ If we combine (1) and (2) we get $ \\log_{12/11}(11/8) > \\frac{57}{37} \\frac{4}{3}$ . Taking reciprocal (that swaps base and argument in the logarithm) and adding 1 we get $$ (\\#3) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\    \\log_{11/8} \\left ( \\frac{12}{11} \\frac{11}{8} \\right ) = \\log_{11/8}(3/2) < $$ $$ <1+\\frac{37}{57} \\frac{3}{4} < \\frac{37}{57}+ \\frac{21}{57} + \\frac{37}{57} \\frac{3}{4} =  $$ $$ = \\frac{37}{57} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{12}{57} \\frac{7}{4} + \\frac{37}{57} \\frac{3}{4}  = $$ $$ =\\frac{37}{57} \\frac{7}{4} + \\frac{12}{57} \\frac{7}{4} = \\frac{49}{57} \\frac{7}{4}$$ Using the inequality $$ (\\#4) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\log_{112/81} (11/8) = 1+ \\log_{112/81}\\left (\\frac{110 \\cdot 81}{112 \\cdot 80} \\right )  = $$ $$ = 1+ \\log_{112/81} \\left (1- \\frac{2}{122} \\right ) - \\log_{112/81}\\left ( 1-\\frac{1}{81} \\right ) < $$ $$ < 1+ \\frac{1}{\\ln(112/81) } \\left ( -\\frac{2}{122} + \\frac{1}{81} \\right ) < 1 $$ We can multiply inequality (3) by the (4), and using $\\log_x y \\log_y z = \\log_x z$ : $$ (\\#5) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\    \\log_{11/8}(3/2) < \\frac{49}{57} \\frac{7}{4} \\Rightarrow \\log_{112/81}(3/2) = \\log_{112/81}(11/8) \\log_{11/8}(3/2) < \\frac{49}{57} \\frac{7}{4} $$ Taking reciprocals and adding 4 we get $$ (\\#6) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\    \\log_{3/2} \\left ( \\frac{112}{81} \\frac{81}{16} \\right) = \\log_{3/2}(7) > $$ $$ > 4+ \\frac{57}{49} \\frac{4}{7}  = \\frac{57}{49} \\cdot 4 - \\frac{8}{49} \\cdot 4 + \\frac{57}{49} \\frac{4}{7} = $$ $$ = \\frac{57}{49} \\frac{32}{7} - \\frac{32}{7} \\frac{7}{49} = \\frac{50}{49} \\frac{32}{7} $$ Consider the following inequality $$ (\\#7) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\log_{75/49}(3/2) = 1+ \\log_{75/49} \\left ( \\frac{49 \\cdot 75}{75 \\cdot 50} \\right ) = $$ $$ = 1+ \\log_{75/49} \\left ( 1- \\frac{1}{50}  \\right ) > 1+ \\frac{1}{\\ln(75/49) } (- \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50^2}) > $$ $$ > 1- 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{51} > 1- \\frac{1}{50} =  \\frac{49}{50} $$ To show (7) we used, between the second and the third row, that $$ (75/49)^2 < (75/48)^2 = (25/16)^2 < e \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\ln(75/49) } = \\log_{75/49}(e) > 2 $$ Indeed, $625 < 256 \\cdot e$ .  We are almost finished: combining the inequalities $$\\log_{3/2}(7) > \\frac{50}{49} \\frac{32}{7}, \\ \\ \\color{red}{\\log_{75/49}(3/2) > \\frac{49}{50}} $$ we get $ \\log_{75/49}(7) > \\frac{32}{7}$ . Taking inverses and adding 2 we get $$ 2+ \\log_7(75/49) = \\log_7(75) < 2+ \\frac{7}{32} = \\frac{71}{32} $$ Putting this to the exponent of $7$ we get $$ 75 < 7^{71/32} \\Rightarrow 75^{32} < 7^{71} $$ as desired!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is to prove that \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\). The user mentioned that their teacher gave this problem along with another one, which they solved using a ratio and expanding it. For the second problem, they tried calculating the ratio numerically and found it's approximately 1.000000949, just barely over 1.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that we need to prove \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\). The user didn't mention any specific constraints or conditions given by the teacher, so the main assumption here is just that we're dealing with the inequality between these two exponential expressions. \n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions were about the variable (like n being an integer) and any divisibility conditions. But in this case, there's no variable with conditions. The problem is purely an inequality comparison. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the numbers given. However, sometimes in inequalities, there might be implicit assumptions, like the exponents being positive integers, but since 71 and 32 are positive integers, and 7 and 75 are positive numbers, those are inherent to the problem. But according to the example, the user listed only necessary assumptions that are explicitly stated or necessary for the problem. Since the original problem doesn't specify any conditions on the exponents or bases beyond what's given, perhaps the only assumption is the problem itself. Wait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was an assumption. Here, the problem is to prove the inequality, so maybe there are no separate assumptions beyond the problem statement. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But here, there's no variable; it's a specific case. So maybe the assumption is just that the exponents and bases are as given. Wait, the problem is to compare two specific numbers: 7^71 and 75^32. So perhaps there are no assumptions needed here beyond the problem statement. But the example included an assumption even when the original problem had a universal quantifier. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's actually modifying the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem changed it to \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", which makes the problem more specific. But in this current problem, the user is to structure the given problem as per the format, which requires listing assumptions. But since the original problem here is just \"Prove \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\)\", there are no additional conditions. So maybe the assumptions section is left empty, but the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps, in this case, the problem's assumptions are the given numbers, but since there are no variables, maybe there are no explicit assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, then another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this problem, there are no variables, so maybe the assumptions are just the problem's numbers. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user wants the problem structured with assumptions and the problem. Since there are no variables or conditions, maybe the assumption is just that 7, 71, 75, and 32 are positive integers, but that's inherent. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed here. But the example included the problem's premise as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed it to assume n is an integer and divisible by 7, which modified the original problem. Wait, maybe the user in that example made a mistake? Wait, the original example says the formatted problem has assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated info and restate the problem with specific assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem had some hidden assumption? No, the example seems to have modified the problem. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo. Anyway, the key point is that the assistant needs to extract assumptions from the original problem. In the current problem, the original problem is to prove \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\). There are no variables here; it's a specific numerical inequality. So perhaps the only assumption is that all numbers are positive real numbers, but that's inherent. Alternatively, there might be no assumptions listed, but according to the example, even if the original problem is a general statement, the assumptions are listed. However, in this case, since it's a specific case, maybe there are no assumptions. But the format requires the assumption section. So perhaps the assumption is just the problem itself. Wait, but the example's problem was restructured with assumptions. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user in the example intended to filter out unrelated info and restate the problem with specific assumptions. Maybe in that example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it? Or perhaps the user in the example made an error. Regardless, for the current problem, the original problem is to prove \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\). There's no variables, so perhaps the assumptions section is left blank. But according to the format, we need to list assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions beyond the given numbers. But perhaps the user wants to structure the problem as per the example, where the assumptions are the conditions on the variables. Since there are no variables here, perhaps the assumptions are implicit. Alternatively, maybe the problem is being misrepresented. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, perhaps in this case, since there are no variables, the assumption is just that 7 and 75 are positive real numbers, and exponents are positive integers. But that's trivial. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any assumptions beyond what's given, so the assumption section is empty. But the example shows that even if the original problem has a universal quantifier, the formatted problem lists assumptions. So maybe the correct approach here is to note that there are no explicit assumptions beyond the problem statement. However, the format requires the assumption section. Perhaps in this case, since there are no variables, we can list the problem's elements as assumptions. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n7 and 75 are positive real numbers,\n71 and 32 are positive integers.\n\nBut that's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compare these two exponentials, so the only assumption is that the exponents are as given. But maybe the user wants to keep the assumption section empty. But according to the example, even if the original problem had no explicit assumptions, the formatted problem includes some. So maybe in this case, there are no additional assumptions, so the assumption section is empty. But that's not allowed in the format. Wait, looking at the example again, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which was converted into an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added. Wait, perhaps the user in the example made a mistake. Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7, which restricts it. Maybe that was intentional. But in the current problem, there's no such variable. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list no assumptions, but according to the example, it's required. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the inequality is to be proven using mathematical methods without relying on calculators, since the user mentioned they computed it numerically. But that's more of a constraint. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, but the format requires at least one. In that case, perhaps the assumption is that 7 and 75 are positive numbers, which they are. But that's trivial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are that the exponents are positive integers, but again, that's inherent. \n\nGiven the example provided, even when the original problem had a universal quantifier, the formatted problem added specific assumptions. So perhaps the current problem, which is a specific case, should have assumptions that 7 and 75 are positive real numbers, and 71 and 32 are positive integers. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, and the user just needs to restate the problem. However, the example shows that assumptions are extracted from the problem. Since this problem is a specific numerical inequality, there's no variable to apply assumptions to. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is to have an empty assumption section, but the format requires it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are that the operations are defined (exponents are valid), but that's too trivial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions, and the user should list that. But in the example, even when the problem was general, they listed assumptions. Therefore, perhaps in this case, since there are no variables, the assumption section is left as is. But the format requires it. Maybe the user expects the assumption section to be empty, but according to the example, it's not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is being misrepresented. \n\nWait, perhaps the original example had a mistake. Let me check. The original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that changes the original problem from \"for every integer n\" to \"n is an integer divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Unless the original problem was misstated. Maybe the original problem was for every integer n divisible by 7, but the user miswrote it. Otherwise, the formatted problem is incorrect. \n\nAssuming that the example is correct, perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. But in the current problem, there are no such implicit assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to state the problem without any assumptions, but the format requires at least one. Maybe the user wants to list that the problem involves exponents and inequalities. But that's not an assumption. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the inequality, maybe the assumption is that the operations are valid (i.e., exponents are defined), but that's again trivial. \n\nGiven the example's structure, even if the original problem has a universal quantifier, the formatted problem lists assumptions related to the variables. In this current problem, there are no variables, so perhaps the assumptions are not applicable. But since the format requires the assumption section, maybe we list that there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem statement. However, the example didn't do that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example had a mistake, and the correct approach is to list the problem's conditions. Given that, for the current problem, the only thing to list is the problem itself. But according to the example, the problem is split into assumptions and the problem. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the components of the problem. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n7^{71} and 75^{32} are real numbers.\nProblem:\nProve that 7^{71} > 75^{32}.\n\nBut that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that the exponents are integers, which they are. So:\n\nAssumption:\n71 and 32 are positive integers,\n7 and 75 are positive real numbers.\n\nBut again, that's obvious. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions, and the user just needs to restate the problem. However, the example shows that even when the original problem had a general statement, the formatted problem added specific assumptions. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the correct answer is to list no assumptions and restate the problem. But the format requires both sections. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to follow the example's structure. The example took the original problem, which was a universal statement, and turned it into a specific assumption (adding that n is divisible by 7). But in the current problem, there's no such variable. Therefore, maybe the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: None (or not applicable)\nProblem: Prove that \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\).\n\nBut since the example didn't have \"None\", perhaps the user expects to list the problem's components as assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considered to have no assumptions beyond the given numbers. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nProblem: Prove that \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\).\n\nBut the example's assumption section had two assumptions. However, in this case, there are no variables or conditions. Therefore, the correct formatting is to leave the assumption section empty. But the user's example shows that even when the original problem has a general variable, the formatted problem adds specific assumptions. Therefore, perhaps in this case, since there are no variables, the assumption section is empty. But the format requires it. Maybe the user wants us to write \"None\" or similar, but in the example, it wasn't done. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the inequality is to be proven using algebraic methods without relying on numerical computation, as the user mentioned they used a computer. But that's part of the problem's context, not an assumption. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to follow the example but adapt it to this problem. Since there are no variables or additional conditions, the assumption section is empty. However, the user's example didn't have an empty assumption section. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is to list the problem's elements as assumptions, even if they're trivial. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n7 and 75 are positive real numbers,\n71 and 32 are positive integers.\nProblem:\nProve that \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe the problem as stated has no assumptions beyond what's given, so the assumption section is left blank. However, the example shows that assumptions are listed even when they're part of the problem's original statement. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list the problem's components as assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's only assumption is that the inequality is to be proven, so the problem is restated. But that's not correct. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the intended answer is:\n\nAssumption: \nProblem: Prove that \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\).\n\nBut according to the example, the assumption section should list conditions applied to one object each. However, in this problem, there are no variables or conditions. Therefore, the assumption section is empty, but since the format requires it, perhaps we list the problem's components. Alternatively, the problem is to be taken as-is. \n\nGiven the example provided, which added an assumption even when it wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps the user wants to filter out unrelated information. In the current problem, the user mentions that they computed the ratio numerically, but the problem requires a proof. So perhaps the assumption is that we need to prove it without using numerical computation. But that's a method, not an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, the problem has no assumptions, so the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: \nProblem: Prove that \\(7^{71} > 75^{32}\\).\n\nBut the example's format had two assumptions listed. To adhere to the example's structure, maybe the assumptions are the exponents and bases. But since there's no conditionality, perhaps the answer is as above.",
