    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is about proving that a function f is differentiable at a point a, given that for every path g through a with derivative v at 0, the composition f∘g has a derivative at 0 equal to T(v), where T is a fixed linear transformation. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what differentiability means in multivariable calculus. A function f is differentiable at a if there exists a linear map T (the derivative) such that the limit as v approaches 0 of [f(a + v) - f(a) - T(v)] / |v| is zero. That's exactly equation (0) the user mentioned. So, they already know that T is supposed to be the derivative, and they need to prove that this limit holds.\n\nThe problem says that for every path g with g(0) = a and g’(0) = v, the derivative of f∘g at 0 is T(v). So, the key here is that this condition holds for every possible such path, not just straight lines. The user tried using the straight-line path t ↦ a + tv, but that might not use the full strength of the hypothesis, as they mentioned. Because maybe if you only have that path, you can get directional derivatives, but differentiability requires more than just directional derivatives existing; they need to be linear and the remainder term has to vanish appropriately.\n\nWait, but in this case, T is already given as a linear transformation. So, the directional derivatives in every direction v are T(v), which is linear in v. Normally, if directional derivatives exist in all directions and are linear, that's not enough for differentiability, right? Because you need some uniformity or continuity in the directions. For example, there are functions with directional derivatives in all directions, linear in the direction, but not differentiable because the limit doesn't hold uniformly.\n\nBut here, the hypothesis is stronger: not just directional derivatives, but the derivative of f along any smooth path through a with velocity v at t=0 is T(v). So, even if the path approaches a from different directions with velocity v, the derivative is always T(v). That must be a stronger condition than just having directional derivatives. So, maybe this condition ensures that the remainder term goes to zero.\n\nSo, how do I approach proving that the limit (0) is zero? Suppose, for contradiction, that the limit is not zero. Then there exists some ε > 0 such that for every δ > 0, there's a vector v with |v| < δ but |f(a + v) - f(a) - T(v)| ≥ ε |v|. If we can construct a path g that in some way oscillates or approaches a in such a way that the derivative of f∘g at 0 would not be T(v), which would contradict the given hypothesis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize a path that approaches a along different directions with varying speeds. But since the hypothesis holds for every path, perhaps we can choose a path that moves along a direction v scaled in such a way that the ratio of the error term to |v| doesn't go to zero. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the definition. Let me think. The user already knows that T is the candidate derivative. So, suppose we define the remainder R(v) = f(a + v) - f(a) - T(v). We need to show that R(v)/|v| → 0 as v → 0.\n\nIf this is not the case, then there exists a sequence v_k → 0 such that |R(v_k)| / |v_k| ≥ ε for some ε > 0. Then, perhaps we can construct a path that goes through the points a + v_k in such a way that the derivative of f∘g at 0 does not equal T(v), leading to a contradiction.\n\nHow to construct such a path? For each k, let’s say we have a vector v_k with |v_k| = r_k, where r_k → 0. Let’s parametrize a path that for t near 0, moves from a to a + v_k when t is of a certain size. For example, maybe piecewise linear paths that go through a + v_k at t = 1/k. But we need the path to be smooth at t=0. Alternatively, we can use a path that moves in the direction of v_k with a certain speed.\n\nWait, perhaps using a path that is a straight line but scaled so that at t = t_k, we reach a + v_k. But we need the derivative at 0 to be a certain velocity. Let's think. Suppose we have a sequence of vectors v_k approaching 0. Let’s define paths g_k(t) such that g_k(0) = a, and g_k’(0) = w_k, where w_k is something related to v_k. But we need the composite function (f∘g_k)’(0) to equal T(w_k). If we can arrange that along this path, the difference quotient [f(g_k(t)) - f(a)] / t tends to T(w_k). But how does that relate to the remainder R(v)?\n\nAlternatively, suppose we take a specific path that for each k, moves in the direction of v_k with a certain parametrization. For example, define g(t) = a + t w + h(t) where h(t) is some higher-order term. But I need to think more carefully.\n\nAnother approach: Let's suppose that the limit (0) does not hold. Then, as I said, there exists ε > 0 and a sequence v_k → 0 such that |R(v_k)| ≥ ε |v_k|. Let’s normalize the vectors v_k by setting h_k = v_k / |v_k|, so |h_k| = 1. Then, we can write v_k = |v_k| h_k. Now, the sequence h_k is on the unit sphere, which is compact in finite dimensions, so there is a subsequence converging to some h with |h| = 1. Let's assume h_k → h (by passing to a subsequence if necessary).\n\nNow, consider the paths g_k(t) = a + t |v_k| h_k. Then, g_k’(0) = |v_k| h_k. But according to the hypothesis, (f∘g_k)’(0) = T(|v_k| h_k) = |v_k| T(h_k). On the other hand, (f∘g_k)’(0) is the derivative of f at a in the direction of |v_k| h_k. Let's compute (f∘g_k)’(0):\n\n(f∘g_k)'(0) = lim_{t→0} [f(g_k(t)) - f(a)] / t = lim [f(a + t |v_k| h_k) - f(a)] / t.\n\nBut f(a + t |v_k| h_k) = f(a) + T(t |v_k| h_k) + R(t |v_k| h_k). So, substituting that in:\n\n(f∘g_k)'(0) = lim [T(t |v_k| h_k) + R(t |v_k| h_k)] / t = lim [t |v_k| T(h_k) + R(t |v_k| h_k)] / t = |v_k| T(h_k) + lim [R(t |v_k| h_k) / t].\n\nBut according to the problem's hypothesis, this should equal T(g_k’(0)) = T(|v_k| h_k) = |v_k| T(h_k). Therefore, the limit term [R(t |v_k| h_k) / t] must go to zero as t → 0. But that limit is lim_{t→0} [R(t |v_k| h_k) / t] = lim [R(s h_k) / (s / |v_k|)] where s = t |v_k|. So, s → 0 as t →0, so this becomes lim_{s→0} [R(s h_k) |v_k| / s ] = |v_k| lim_{s→0} [R(s h_k)/s].\n\nBut R(s h_k) = f(a + s h_k) - f(a) - T(s h_k) = s [ (f(a + s h_k) - f(a))/s - T(h_k) ]. So, R(s h_k)/s = [ (f(a + s h_k) - f(a))/s - T(h_k) ] → 0 as s → 0 because the directional derivative in direction h_k is T(h_k). Wait, but this seems to suggest that the limit is zero, hence (f∘g_k)’(0) = |v_k| T(h_k) + |v_k| * 0 = |v_k| T(h_k), which matches the hypothesis. So, this path doesn't give a contradiction. Hmm. Maybe this approach is not helpful.\n\nWait, but we have another sequence v_k where R(v_k)/|v_k| ≥ ε. Let's think of the vectors v_k. Let’s parametrize a path that goes through a + v_k at some t_k. For example, define a path that goes from a to a + v_k in a way that the derivative at 0 is in the direction of v_k. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider a path that moves along the direction of v_k with a certain scaling. For example, let’s define g_k(t) = a + t w_k, where w_k is such that t w_k = v_k for some t. But that might not work because t would have to vary. Wait, perhaps if we take a path that for t in [0,1], goes from a to a + v_k. But that would have derivative w_k = v_k, but then (f∘g_k)’(0) = D_v_k f(a) = T(v_k). But according to the problem, this is already given, so we can’t get a contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, think of a path that oscillates between different directions. Suppose that as t approaches 0, the path g(t) approaches a, but the direction of g(t) - a varies in such a way that the difference quotient doesn't settle down. But since the hypothesis requires that for every path, the derivative exists and is T(v), maybe such a path would violate the hypothesis.\n\nWait, but if the limit (0) does not hold, then there are points approaching a where the error R(v) is not negligible compared to |v|. So, perhaps construct a path that passes through those points with a certain parametrization. For example, take a sequence v_k → 0 with |R(v_k)| ≥ ε |v_k|. For each k, define a segment from a to a + v_k, and then concatenate these segments in a smooth way such that the path approaches a as t→0. Then, the derivative along this path at t=0 would need to be T(v), but the actual derivative might differ because of the accumulated error from the R(v_k).\n\nBut constructing such a path smoothly might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe use a single direction but scaled according to the sequence. Wait, if we take h_k = v_k / |v_k|, which is a unit vector. Then, since h_k converges to some h (by compactness), we can take a path that moves in the direction h but with a parametrization that sometimes goes out to h_k with speed |v_k|. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider the path defined by g(t) = a + t h + t^2 w(t), where w(t) is some function. But not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Suppose that the limit (0) does not hold. Then, there exists ε > 0 and a sequence v_k → 0 such that |R(v_k)| ≥ ε |v_k|. Let’s write v_k = |v_k| h_k with |h_k| = 1. Then, define a path g(t) such that near t = 0, it follows the directions h_k scaled by |v_k|. For example, let’s set g(t) = a + t h_k when t is in an interval around |v_k|. But how to make this smooth?\n\nAlternatively, use a piecewise linear path that goes through the points a + v_k at times t = |v_k|. But this would not be smooth at the points t = |v_k|. To make it smooth, perhaps use a bump function or mollify the path. But this might be too involved.\n\nAlternatively, take a path that for each k, when t is in [1/(k+1), 1/k], it moves from a + v_{k} to a + v_{k+1} in some smooth way, but ensuring that the derivative at t=0 is some direction. Wait, but as t approaches 0, which corresponds to k approaching infinity, the path would have to move through all the v_k's. This might not necessarily have a derivative at t=0 unless the directions h_k stabilize.\n\nBut since h_k converges to h (by compactness), maybe the derivative at t=0 would be in the direction h. Then, the composite function (f∘g)'(0) should be T(h). However, along this path, when t is near 1/k, the function f(g(t)) would have a change related to f(a + v_k), which has a large error term. So, perhaps the derivative (f∘g)'(0) would not just be T(h), leading to a contradiction.\n\nBut I need to formalize this. Let's suppose that the path g(t) is constructed such that for each k, g(1/k) = a + v_k. Then, the derivative from the right at t=1/k would involve [f(a + v_k) - f(a)] / (1/k). But this is not directly helpful for the derivative at t=0.\n\nAlternatively, parametrizing g(t) such that for t > 0, g(t) = a + v_k when t = t_k, where t_k → 0. Then, the derivative at t=0 would be lim_{t→0} [f(g(t)) - f(a)] / t. If g(t) is designed such that when t approaches 0, g(t) approaches a through the points a + v_k, then [f(g(t)) - f(a)] / t ≈ [f(a + v_k) - f(a)] / t_k, where t_k is the corresponding t for v_k. But if we set t_k = |v_k|, then [f(a + v_k) - f(a)] / t_k = [T(v_k) + R(v_k)] / |v_k| = T(h_k) + R(v_k)/|v_k|. Since R(v_k)/|v_k| ≥ ε, this would imply that the difference quotient [f(g(t)) - f(a)] / t does not approach T(h), assuming h_k → h. But according to the hypothesis, (f∘g)'(0) should be T(v), where v = g’(0). If g’(0) exists, then v would be the derivative of g at 0. However, if g is constructed such that it moves through the points a + v_k at times t_k, then the derivative g’(0) might not exist unless the directions h_k stabilize.\n\nThis seems a bit too vague. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that they tried assuming the limit does not exist and constructing a path, but didn't succeed. Maybe a different approach. Let's recall that differentiability is equivalent to the existence of a linear approximation with the error term vanishing faster than |v|. Here, the hypothesis gives that all directional derivatives exist and are linear, but even more, that the derivative along any path with velocity v is T(v). So, maybe use a mean value theorem approach or consider integrating over paths?\n\nAlternatively, since T is linear, maybe express f(a + v) - f(a) - T(v) in terms of an integral of the derivative along some path from a to a + v. But since f is only known to have directional derivatives along paths, not necessarily being differentiable, that might not hold.\n\nWait, but if we take any path from a to a + v, say g(t) = a + tv for t in [0,1], then (f∘g)'(t) exists for t in [0,1], right? Because the hypothesis says that for any path, (f∘g)'(0) exists and equals T(v). But does it say anything about (f∘g)'(t) for t ≠ 0? The problem states that for every path g:(-ε, ε) → U with g(0) = a and g’(0) = v, the derivative (f∘g)’(0) = T(v). It doesn’t say anything about other points. So, we can’t assume differentiability elsewhere.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps integrate along the straight line from a to a + v. If we can write f(a + v) - f(a) as the integral of (f∘g)’(0) over some parameter. Wait, but (f∘g)’(0) is T(v) for the straight line path. But integrating over what?\n\nAlternatively, consider that for the straight line path g(t) = a + tv, then (f∘g)'(0) = T(v). But (f∘g)'(t) at other points would require differentiability along the path, which we don't have. So, maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Use the definition of differentiable. Let's write:\n\nf(a + v) - f(a) - T(v) = o(|v|). We need to show that this remainder is o(|v|). Suppose it's not. Then, as before, there's a sequence v_k → 0 with |R(v_k)| ≥ ε |v_k|. Let’s consider those v_k. For each such v_k, define a path that moves from a to a + v_k in a way that the velocity at 0 is h_k = v_k / |v_k|. But then, the derivative (f∘g_k)’(0) = T(h_k) by hypothesis. However, expanding f(a + tv_k) - f(a) = t T(v_k) + R(t v_k). So, (f∘g_k)'(0) = lim_{t→0} [f(a + tv_k) - f(a)] / t = T(v_k) + lim_{t→0} R(tv_k)/t. But R(tv_k)/t = [f(a + tv_k) - f(a) - T(tv_k)] / t = [f(a + tv_k) - f(a)] / t - T(v_k). So, lim_{t→0} R(tv_k)/t = 0, because the directional derivative exists and is T(v_k). Therefore, (f∘g_k)'(0) = T(v_k) + 0 = T(v_k). But according to the problem's hypothesis, this must equal T(g_k’(0)). What's g_k’(0)? If g_k(t) = a + tv_k, then g_k’(0) = v_k. Therefore, T(g_k’(0)) = T(v_k). So, there's no contradiction here. So, this doesn't help.\n\nWait, but the problem is that even though along straight lines the derivative matches T(v), the remainder R(v) might not be o(|v|). But how does the condition on all paths help? Because if we can find some path where the remainder doesn't vanish, but according to the problem, along any path, the derivative of f∘g at 0 is T(v). So, maybe consider a path that approaches a in a way that the difference quotient [f(a + v) - f(a) - T(v)] / |v| doesn't go to zero.\n\nLet’s formalize this. Suppose the limit (0) does not exist. Then, there exists ε > 0 and a sequence v_k → 0 with |R(v_k)| ≥ ε |v_k|. Let’s normalize u_k = v_k / |v_k|, so |u_k| = 1. Then, we can write v_k = |v_k| u_k. Since the unit sphere is compact, {u_k} has a convergent subsequence, say u_k → u.\n\nNow, construct a path g: (-ε, ε) → U such that g(t) = a + t u + h(t), where h(t) is a function that adjusts the direction to pass through the points v_k. For example, for t near |v_k|, adjust the direction to u_k. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, construct a path that for each k, when t = |v_k|, the path is at a + v_k. For example, set g(t) = a + t u + t w(t), where w(t) is chosen such that when t = |v_k|, then t u + t w(t) = v_k. Then, w(|v_k|) = (v_k / |v_k| - u). But as k → ∞, |v_k| → 0, and u_k → u, so w(|v_k|) = (u_k - u). Which tends to 0. So, if w(t) is continuous, then w(t) → 0 as t →0. Then, g’(0) = u + 0 = u. Therefore, according to the hypothesis, (f∘g)’(0) = T(u). But let's compute (f∘g)'(0):\n\nlim_{t→0} [f(g(t)) - f(a)] / t = lim [f(a + t u + t w(t)) - f(a)] / t.\n\nExpanding using the definition of R:\n\n= lim [T(t u + t w(t)) + R(t u + t w(t))] / t\n\n= lim [t T(u) + t T(w(t)) + R(t(u + w(t)))] / t\n\n= T(u) + T(w(t)) + lim [R(t(u + w(t))) / t]\n\nAs t →0, w(t) →0, so T(w(t)) →0 because T is linear and continuous. So, the middle term tends to 0. Then, we need the last term to tend to 0. But R(t(u + w(t))) / t = [f(a + t(u + w(t))) - f(a) - T(t(u + w(t)))] / t.\n\n= [f(a + t(u + w(t))) - f(a)] / t - T(u + w(t)).\n\nThe first term is the difference quotient along the direction u + w(t), which by hypothesis has a limit T(u + w(t)). So, the expression becomes T(u + w(t)) - T(u + w(t)) = 0. Therefore, the limit is zero. Hence, (f∘g)’(0) = T(u). Which matches the hypothesis. So, this path doesn't give a contradiction either.\n\nHmm. This approach doesn't seem to work. Maybe there's a different way.\n\nWait, the key is that the hypothesis holds for every path. So, even if you take a path that zig-zags or varies directions as it approaches a, the derivative must still be T(v) where v is the velocity of the path at 0.\n\nSuppose that the remainder R(v) is not o(|v|). Then, there exists a sequence v_k with |R(v_k)| ≥ ε |v_k|. Let's use these v_k to construct a path that at certain scales t_k = |v_k|, the function f has a large error. For example, define a path that moves in the direction of v_k with a parameterization such that the derivative at 0 is some averaged velocity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider a path that is a combination of the directions v_k. For instance, a path that for t in [1/(k+1), 1/k], moves along v_k. But again, the smoothness at t=0 is an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps use a spiral-like path that approaches a through different directions. But unless the directions v_k are arranged in a particular way, it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that T is linear and so the error term R(v) must satisfy R(v)/|v| →0. Suppose, for contradiction, that it doesn't. Then, there exists ε>0 and v_k→0 such that |R(v_k)| ≥ ε |v_k|. Let’s define a path g such that g(t_k)=a + v_k for some t_k→0, and the derivative at 0 is in some direction. But to have g’(0)=v, we need g(t) ≈ a + tv for small t. So, if we want g(t_k) =a + v_k, then perhaps set t_k = |v_k| and define g(t) = a + t*(v_k / |v_k|) when t is near |v_k|. But this would make the derivative at 0 to be v_k / |v_k|, which is a unit vector. But as k increases, v_k / |v_k| might approach some unit vector h. Then, the derivative g’(0) would need to be h, and according to the hypothesis, (f∘g)’(0)=T(h). But when t approaches 0 through t = |v_k|, then [f(g(t)) - f(a)] / t = [f(a + v_k) - f(a)] / |v_k| = [T(v_k) + R(v_k)] / |v_k| = T(v_k / |v_k|) + R(v_k)/|v_k|. As k→∞, T(v_k / |v_k|) approaches T(h), and R(v_k)/|v_k| is ≥ ε. Therefore, the limit would be T(h) + something ≥ ε, contradicting the hypothesis that (f∘g)’(0)=T(h). Therefore, this would give a contradiction.\n\nWait, let's formalize this. Suppose that for the constructed path g, g’(0) = h. Then, by hypothesis, (f∘g)’(0) must be T(h). However, if along the sequence t_k = |v_k|, the difference quotient [f(g(t_k)) - f(a)] / t_k = [f(a + v_k) - f(a)] / |v_k| = T(v_k)/|v_k| + R(v_k)/|v_k| = T(h_k) + R(v_k)/|v_k|. Since h_k = v_k / |v_k| converges to h, T(h_k) converges to T(h). But R(v_k)/|v_k| ≥ ε. Therefore, the difference quotient approaches T(h) + something ≥ T(h) + ε. But (f∘g)’(0) must be T(h), which requires the difference quotient to approach T(h). Therefore, we have a contradiction, implying that our assumption that the limit (0) does not hold is false.\n\nTherefore, the error term must be o(|v|), so f is differentiable at a with derivative T.\n\nThis seems to work. So, the key idea is to assume that the limit does not hold, take a sequence v_k with |R(v_k)| ≥ ε |v_k|, construct a path that passes through these v_k in such a way that the derivative of the composite function at 0 would not match T(h), hence contradicting the hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is structured as per the required format, listing assumptions and the problem.",
