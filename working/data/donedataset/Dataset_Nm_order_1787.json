    "Content": "This problem has been bugging me for a while.  As was stated in the title, I wish to prove: $A$ is an integrally closed domain $\\Rightarrow$ $A[t]$ is integrally closed domain Here's what I have so far... Suppose $f \\in k(t) = Frac(A[t])$ is integral over $A[t]$.  Then, trivially, it is integral over $k[t]$.  However, $k[t]$ is a PID, hence a UFD, and is thus integrally closed.  So $f \\in k[t]$. So the problem is reduced to: $A$ is an integrally closed domain $\\Rightarrow$ $A[t]$ is integrally closed in $k[t]$. Now, $f$ is integral.  We may (with no loss of generality) assume $f$ is monic by adding a high power of $t$.  (Since $t^n$ is integral, $t^n + f$ is integral if and only if $f$ is.)  We write $$f^n + a_{n-1}f^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_1 f + a_0 = 0$$ $$f (f^{n-1} + a_{n-1} f^{n-2} + \\ldots + a_2 f + a_1 ) = -a_0$$ Now I'd like to be able to use the Gauss lemma and win, but every time I try to do that it beats me. Attempt 1: $f$ is monic, so I'd like to make $f^{n-1} + a_{n-1} f^{n-2} + \\ldots + a_2 f + a_1$ monic as well.  However, if I divide by the leading coefficient $q$, I have to divide $-a_0$ by $q$.  Unfortunately, there's no guarantee (that I know of) keeping $-a_0/q$ in $A[t]$. Attempt 2: Add a really high power of $t$ to $f$.  But there is no bound on the degree of the coefficients, so again there's no guarantee this will be monic. I think I'm in the right direction, but this problem is getting into my head.  Any thoughts are welcome! Thanks (For those who are interested, this is a question from Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory Chapter 1, Section 2, Question 2)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that $f\\in k[t]$ is integral over $A[t]$ and $f^n + a_{n-1}(t)f^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1(t)f + a_0(t) = 0$, where $a_i(t)\\in A[t]$. Let $m$ be an integer greater than the degree of $f$ and all the degrees of $a_i$. Set $f_1(t)=f(t)-t^m$. If $q(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}(t)x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_1(t)x+a_0(t)$, then $f_1$ is a root of $q_1(x)=q(x+t^m)$. Note that $q_1(x)=x^n+b_{n-1}(t)x^{n-1}+\\cdots+b_1(t)x+b_0(t)$ and $b_0(t)=q(t^m)$ is monic. Since $f_1(f_1^{n-1}+b_{n-1}f_1^{n-2}+\\cdots +b_1(t))=-b_0(t)$ and $f_1$ and $b_0$ are monic, it follows that $f_1^{n-1}+b_{n-1}f_1^{n-2}+\\cdots +b_1(t)$ is also monic, and now you can apply Gauss Lemma.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that if A is an integrally closed domain, then A[t] is also an integrally closed domain. Let me parse through the given question and the attempts made so far to understand where the difficulty lies.\n\nFirst, the user starts by considering an element f in the fraction field of A[t], which is k(t) where k is the fraction field of A. They note that if f is integral over A[t], then it's also integral over k[t]. Since k[t] is a PID and hence a UFD, it's integrally closed, so f must be in k[t]. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that A[t] is integrally closed in k[t].\n\nNext, the user assumes f is monic (by adding a high power of t if necessary) and writes out the integral equation: f^n + a_{n-1}f^{n-1} + ... + a_0 = 0. They manipulate this to f*(f^{n-1} + ... + a_1) = -a_0. The idea here is to apply Gauss's Lemma, which relates the irreducibility in a polynomial ring to the content of the polynomials.\n\nIn Attempt 1, the user considers making the cofactor (the term multiplied by f) monic by dividing by its leading coefficient q, but they're concerned about whether -a_0/q would remain in A[t]. Without knowing that q is a unit in A, this step is problematic.\n\nAttempt 2 mentions adding a high power of t to f to make it monic, but they realize there's no bound on the coefficients' degrees, so this might not help.\n\nThe key here is to use the fact that A is integrally closed. Since f is in k[t] and integral over A[t], we need to show that f actually lies in A[t]. One approach is to look at the coefficients of f and use the integrality condition to show each coefficient must be in A, leveraging that A is integrally closed.\n\nGauss's Lemma in this context might require that A be integrally closed to ensure that the content of a product of polynomials is the product of their contents. Since A is integrally closed, the content of any polynomial in A[t] that's primitive would remain so in k[t], helping to conclude that f must have coefficients in A.\n\nThe user's attempts are on the right track but missing the connection to the integral closure of A. By considering the coefficients of f and using the integral equation, each coefficient of f can be shown to be integral over A. Because A is integrally closed, those coefficients must then be in A, proving f is in A[t].\n\nSo, the assumptions need to include that A is an integrally closed domain, and the problem is to show A[t] is integrally closed. The user's original problem might have some missing assumptions, but based on the given information, the key assumption is that A is integrally closed.",
