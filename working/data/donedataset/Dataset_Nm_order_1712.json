    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: start with $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{7}} = \\cos(\\pi/7) + i\\sin(\\pi/7)$ and the fact that the lhs is a 7th root of -1. Let $u = e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{7}}$, then we want to find $\\Re(u + u^3 + u^5)$. Then we have $u^7 = -1$ so $u^6 - u^5 + u^4 - u^3 + u^2 -u + 1 = 0$. Re-arranging this we get: $u^6 + u^4 + u^2 + 1 = u^5 + u^3 + u$. If $a = u + u^3 + u^5$ then this becomes $u a + 1 = a$, and rearranging this gives $a(1 - u) = 1$, or $a = \\dfrac{1}{1 - u}$. So all we have to do is find $\\Re\\left(\\dfrac{1}{1 - u}\\right)$. $\\dfrac{1}{1 - u} = \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\cos(\\pi/7) - i \\sin(\\pi/7)} = \\dfrac{1 - \\cos(\\pi/7) + i \\sin(\\pi/7)}{2 - 2 \\cos(\\pi/7)}$ so $\\Re\\left(\\dfrac{1}{1 - u}\\right) = \\dfrac{1 - \\cos(\\pi/7)}{2 - 2\\cos(\\pi/7)} = \\dfrac{1}{2} $",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let's see. The original problem is about proving that the sum of cosines of π/7, 3π/7, and 5π/7 equals 1/2. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The example given had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Here, the problem doesn't mention any specific conditions except the angles involved. The angles π/7, 3π/7, and 5π/7 are all in radians, and they're odd multiples of π/7. Since cosine is a trigonometric function, I should check if there are any implicit assumptions. \n\nThe problem doesn't state any restrictions on the angles other than their specific values, so the main assumptions would be about the angles being in radians and the sum involving those specific cosines. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the variables are the angles, but they are fixed. Wait, maybe there are no variables here, just specific angles. So perhaps the assumptions are the specific angles given? Let me think.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sum of these three cosines equals 1/2. The original question mentions trying trigonometric identities and a geometric interpretation. So the assumptions would be the specific angles: π/7, 3π/7, 5π/7. Each term is a cosine of these angles. So each assumption would be one angle? But the example had assumptions applied to one object each. In the example, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps each angle is part of the problem, but they are given. Wait, maybe there are no separate assumptions here beyond the problem statement. The problem is to prove the sum equals 1/2. So maybe the assumptions are just the three cosine terms being summed. But the example's format required listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nHmm. Let me re-examine the example. In the example, the user had to split the problem's conditions into assumptions. The original problem said \"for every integer n,\" which became \"$n$ is an integer.\" Then there was a separate assumption \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" But in the current problem, the angles are fixed. The user is just asking to prove that the sum of those three cosines equals 1/2. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions here except the angles themselves. Wait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, which was made explicit. Here, the problem is about specific angles. Maybe the only assumption is that the angles are in radians? But that's standard unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed here beyond the problem's statement, but the format requires listing assumptions. Wait, looking at the example, even if the problem didn't have explicit assumptions, the user had to extract them. But in this case, the problem is straightforward: sum these three cosines and prove it's 1/2. There are no variables here, just specific values. So perhaps there are no assumptions, but the format requires at least an assumption section. But in the example, the user included \"$n$ is an integer\" even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n,\" so maybe here, since the problem is about specific angles, the assumptions would be that each angle is a real number, or more specifically, each angle is a multiple of π/7. Wait, the angles are π/7, 3π/7, 5π/7. So maybe each angle is of the form (2k-1)π/7 for k=1,2,3. But how to phrase that as assumptions. Alternatively, since the problem is just summing these three terms, maybe each term is an assumption. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nθ₁ = π/7,\nθ₂ = 3π/7,\nθ₃ = 5π/7.\n\nBut the example used assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer,\" so each assumption is a property of one object. Here, the problem is about three specific angles. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nθ₁ is π/7,\nθ₂ is 3π/7,\nθ₃ is 5π/7.\n\nBut maybe that's redundant because the problem already states those angles. Alternatively, maybe there are no separate assumptions, and the problem is self-contained. However, according to the example, even if the problem is \"Prove that for every integer n...\", the assumption is \"$n$ is an integer,\" which is redundant but necessary for the format. So perhaps here, even though the angles are given, we need to list each angle as an assumption. But since they are all part of the problem statement, maybe the assumptions are just each term in the sum. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any assumptions beyond what's given, but the format requires me to list them. Wait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was split into an assumption. Wait, maybe in the original problem, the user had a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7, but in the example, the user structured it as assumptions. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, maybe the example was modified. Let me check again.\n\nThe example's original problem says: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that would actually be incorrect, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't include n is divisible by 7 unless the problem was miswritten. Alternatively, maybe the example is wrong. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote it as \"for every integer n\". That would be a problem. But regardless, following the example, the user split the problem's conditions into separate assumptions. So even if the problem says \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". Then, perhaps the example had a typo, but moving forward, for the current problem, the task is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to prove that cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) + cos(5π/7) = 1/2. So what are the assumptions here? The problem doesn't specify any variables or conditions; it's a specific identity. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the three angles involved. So each angle is an odd multiple of π/7. So, for example:\n\nAssumption:\nθ₁ = π/7,\nθ₂ = 3π/7,\nθ₃ = 5π/7.\n\nBut the example used assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\", so maybe each angle is considered an object with a specific value. Alternatively, since the problem is about summing three cosines, maybe each term in the sum is an assumption. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Since this problem doesn't have variables but fixed angles, maybe there are no explicit assumptions. But the format requires listing assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the angles being in radians, but that's standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the angles are in the first quadrant, but π/7, 3π/7, 5π/7 are all between 0 and π, so their cosines are defined. But maybe these are not necessary assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the sum is taken over these specific angles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, but the format requires something. In that case, perhaps the assumptions are the three terms being summed. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, there's no variable. So perhaps the answer should have no assumptions? But the example required splitting the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem in the example was \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. But here, since there's no variable, maybe the assumptions are left empty. But that can't be. The user provided an example where even the problem had a universal quantifier, they broke it into an assumption. But in this problem, there's no quantifier; it's a specific identity. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the three cosine terms. But how to phrase them as assumptions.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just the sum equals 1/2, and there are no separate assumptions. But according to the example, even if the problem is a general statement, the assumptions are extracted. So maybe in this case, the only assumption is that the angles are π/7, 3π/7, 5π/7. So each angle is listed as an assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nθ₁ = π/7,\nθ₂ = 3π/7,\nθ₃ = 5π/7.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nθ₁ is π/7,\nθ₂ is 3π/7,\nθ₃ is 5π/7.\n\nBut in the example, they used \"$n$ is an integer\", so maybe here, each angle is an object with a value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's assumption is that the sum is of these three cosines. But the problem is to prove the sum equals 1/2, so the sum itself is the problem. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to list each term in the sum as an assumption. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any assumptions beyond what's stated, so the assumptions section is empty. But the example shows that even if the problem is general, assumptions are extracted. So perhaps in this case, the only assumption is that the angles are given as specified. So each angle is an assumption. Therefore, three assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nFirst term is cos(π/7),\nSecond term is cos(3π/7),\nThird term is cos(5π/7).\n\nBut each assumption should be one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first angle is π/7,\nThe second angle is 3π/7,\nThe third angle is 5π/7.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to sum those three cosines, the assumptions are that each cosine is taken at those specific angles. Therefore, each line would state the value of the angle inside the cosine. So:\n\nAssumption:\ncos(π/7) is a term in the sum,\ncos(3π/7) is a term in the sum,\ncos(5π/7) is a term in the sum.\n\nBut that's repeating the problem. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look back at the example. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems contradictory because if n must be divisible by 7, then it's not for every integer n. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. If the original problem was \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", then the assumptions would be correct. But if it's \"for every integer n\", then the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the example was wrong. \n\nAssuming that the example is correct as provided, the user wants to split the problem's conditions into separate assumptions, even if they are part of the problem statement. In this case, the current problem states the sum of three specific cosines. Therefore, the assumptions would be each of those three cosine terms. So each term is present in the sum. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum includes cos(π/7),\nThe sum includes cos(3π/7),\nThe sum includes cos(5π/7).\n\nBut that's redundant with the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the problem is as stated. But the example required listing assumptions even when they were part of the problem's universal statement. Therefore, perhaps for this problem, there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem's own terms. In that case, maybe the assumptions section is empty, but the format requires it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's only assumption is that the angles are in radians. But that's standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions, so the assumption section is empty. But according to the user's example, even the universal quantifier is turned into an assumption. Therefore, maybe in this case, the problem is to prove the equality, and the assumptions are that each term is a cosine function evaluated at the specified angle. But I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to list the three angles as the assumptions, each being a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nθ₁ = π/7,\nθ₂ = 3π/7,\nθ₃ = 5π/7.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that their sum equals 1/2. That way, each angle is listed as an assumption. I think that's the best approach here, following the example where the variable's conditions are split into assumptions. Even though the angles are not variables, they are specific, but to fit the format, this seems appropriate.",
