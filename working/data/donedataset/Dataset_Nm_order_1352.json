    "Content": "In typical proofs of the irrationality of $\\sqrt{2}$, I have seen the following logic: If $p^2$ is divisible by $2$, then $p$ is divisible by $2$. Perhaps I am being over-analytical, but how do we know this to be true? IE. do we require a proof of this implication, or is it simply fact?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The quickest proof of that fact is to note that every whole number $n$ is either even or odd. If $n$ is even, $n=2k$ for some whole number $k$: $n^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$ is even. If $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$ for some whole number $k$: $n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 +4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 +2k) +1$ is odd. Therefore the square of a whole number is even if and only if that number is even.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about the proof of the irrationality of √2. The user is confused about a specific step in the proof where it's stated that if p² is divisible by 2, then p must also be divisible by 2. They want to know if this is a fact that can be taken for granted or if it needs a proof.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions in the problem. The example provided lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the original problem, the key assumption seems to be related to the properties of integers and divisibility by 2. Specifically, the step in question assumes that if the square of an integer p is divisible by 2, then p itself must be divisible by 2. \n\nSo, the main assumption here is about the integer p and the implication of divisibility by 2 when its square is divisible by 2. The problem is asking whether this implication is something that needs proof or is accepted as fact. Therefore, the structured problem should list the assumption that p is an integer and that p² is divisible by 2, leading to the problem of proving that p is divisible by 2.\n\nI should make sure that each assumption is separate. The first assumption is that p is an integer. The second is that p squared is divisible by 2. The problem then is to show that p itself is divisible by 2. The original question is essentially asking for the justification of this step, so structuring it this way captures the core of the problem.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are different. The problem isn't about n being divisible by something, but about p² being divisible by 2 implying p is. So the two assumptions would be p is an integer, and p² is divisible by 2. The problem is to prove that p is divisible by 2. That should fit the format.\n\nLet me check again. The user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. In this case, the assumptions are p is an integer and p² is divisible by 2. The problem is to prove that p is divisible by 2. That seems correct.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other hidden assumptions. The original proof is about the irrationality of √2, which typically starts by assuming √2 is rational, so p/q where p and q are coprime integers. But the specific step in question is about the implication from p² divisible by 2 to p divisible by 2. So the key assumptions here are just about p being an integer and p² divisible by 2. The problem is to show p is divisible by 2. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as proving p's divisibility by 2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be structured with those two assumptions and the problem as stated.",
