    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem step by step. So, the user is asking about maximal ideals in two different rings: first in the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1], and then in the ring of complex entire functions. \n\nStarting with the first part about continuous functions on [0,1]. The question mentions that every maximal ideal in X = C([0,1], R) is of the form M_x = {f in X | f(x)=0} for some x in [0,1]. They used compactness of [0,1] to show this. Now, they're extending this question to the ring of complex entire functions, denoted here as C(z). The question is whether each M_λ (the set of entire functions vanishing at λ) is a maximal ideal in C(z), and whether every maximal ideal is of this form.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. In ring theory, a maximal ideal is an ideal that is not contained in any other ideal except the ring itself. For the ring of continuous functions on a compact space, like [0,1], the correspondence between points and maximal ideals is established by the Gelfand-Kolmogorov theorem, which states that maximal ideals are precisely the kernels of evaluation homomorphisms at points in the space. That's why for X = C([0,1], R), each M_x is maximal.\n\nNow, moving to the ring of entire functions. Entire functions are holomorphic on the entire complex plane, and the ring C(z) consists of all such functions. The question is whether the ideals M_λ, which are functions vanishing at a specific complex number λ, are maximal and if all maximal ideals are like this.\n\nI need to remember the structure of ideals in rings of entire functions. Unlike the ring of continuous functions, the ring of entire functions is a Bézout domain, meaning every finitely generated ideal is principal. However, it's not a principal ideal domain because there exist ideals that are not finitely generated. \n\nAn important property of entire functions is that they can have zeros only at isolated points, and the zeros can be specified with multiplicities. However, due to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, any set of zeros with appropriate multiplicities can correspond to an entire function. \n\nNow, considering an ideal M_λ. This ideal consists of all entire functions that vanish at λ. To check if it's maximal, we can see if the quotient ring C(z)/M_λ is a field. The quotient ring would consist of equivalence classes of entire functions where two functions are equivalent if they differ by a function vanishing at λ. But evaluating at λ gives a ring homomorphism from C(z) to C, with kernel M_λ. Since the image is a field (C), the kernel M_λ is a maximal ideal. So M_λ is indeed a maximal ideal.\n\nBut the second part of the question is whether every maximal ideal in C(z) is of the form M_λ for some λ in C. This is trickier. In the case of polynomials C[z], every maximal ideal is of the form (z - λ), corresponding to evaluation at λ. But entire functions are more complicated. For example, consider an ideal generated by functions vanishing at infinitely many points. However, in the ring of entire functions, any ideal not contained in any M_λ would have to consist of functions with no common zeros. But by the Weierstrass theorem, if functions have no common zeros, you can generate the entire ring, which implies the ideal is the whole ring. Wait, so maybe every proper ideal is contained in some M_λ? \n\nWait, but if you take a maximal ideal, it must be contained in some M_λ, hence equal to M_λ. Because if an ideal is not contained in any M_λ, then for every λ in C, there is a function in the ideal not vanishing at λ. But since the functions are entire, having no common zero would imply that the ideal contains 1, by the absence of common zeros (using the Weierstrass product theorem to construct an entire function with prescribed zeros, but if there are no common zeros, you can invert the functions somehow? Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, suppose there's a maximal ideal M not of the form M_λ. Then for every λ, there exists a function f_λ in M that doesn't vanish at λ. These functions generate an ideal, but in the ring of entire functions, which is a Bézout domain, the ideal generated by these functions would be principal. However, if there's a function f that generates the ideal, then f cannot have any zeros, because for every λ, there's a function in the ideal not vanishing at λ. But an entire function with no zeros is invertible (since it can be written as e^g for some entire function g), which would mean the ideal is the entire ring, contradicting that M is a proper ideal. Therefore, such a maximal ideal M must be contained in some M_λ, hence equal to M_λ. Thus, every maximal ideal is of the form M_λ.\n\nWait, this seems like a standard argument in analytic geometry. The key idea is that if an ideal is not contained in any M_λ, then it must contain invertible elements, hence the ideal is the whole ring. Therefore, all maximal ideals are indeed of the form M_λ.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes: each M_λ is a maximal ideal, and every maximal ideal in C(z) is of this form. So the user's problem is to prove these two statements.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the given format. The original problem is asking two things: whether each M_λ is maximal, and whether every maximal ideal is of that form. The assumptions here are about the ring being the ring of complex entire functions, M_λ being defined as the set of entire functions vanishing at λ, and the problem is to show M_λ is maximal and that all maximal ideals are of this form. \n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption listed specific conditions on the objects. So in this case, the assumptions should list the definitions of the ring and the ideals M_λ. The problem part will be the two questions.\n\nSo the Assumption part should include:\n\n- C(z) is the ring of complex entire functions.\n- For λ ∈ C, M_λ is the set of entire functions in C(z) with a zero at λ.\n\nThen the Problem is: Prove that each M_λ is a maximal ideal in C(z) and that every maximal ideal in C(z) is of the form M_λ for some λ ∈ C.\n\nBut the user's original question says \"is M_λ a maximal ideal in C(z), and does every ideal happen to be of this form?\" But \"every ideal\" here probably means \"every maximal ideal\", since the first part is about maximality. So the problem is to show two things: M_λ is maximal, and every maximal ideal is M_λ.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have assumptions about the ring and M_λ, and the problem statement combining both questions.",
