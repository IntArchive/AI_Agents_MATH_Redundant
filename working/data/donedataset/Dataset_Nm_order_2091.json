    "Content": "I am in calc 1 and we have just learned the epsilon-delta definition of a limit and I (on my own) wanted to try and use this methodology in order to prove $(e^x-1)/x = 1$ (one of the equivalencies), along with $\\displaystyle \\frac {\\sin(x)}{x} = 1$, that the proof just told us \"was so.\" I do not know how to put the happy little math symbols in this website so I'm going to upload a picture of my work. Now, I understand how to apply the epsilon-delta definition of the limit for some easy problems, even for some complex functions where the numbers simply \"fall out,\" but what do I do with the the $|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon$ after I've made it be $|(e^x-1-x)/x| < \\epsilon$? I understand that I basically need to get $|(e^x-1-x)/x|$ to become equivalent to $|x|$ but how do I do this? Is this factorable? And if this kind of easy problem is difficult for me, does this mean that I do have what it takes to become a math major? I really love this kind of problem-solving but sometimes I just don't get the answer. Thanks! http://tinypic.com/r/wiae6f/7 The above is my problem.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Another approach, harder to handle rigorously than any of the ones suggested so far, is to do it the way Euler did, essentially by defining $e$ as \n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n.$$\n(But then we would in particular want to prove that the limit exists, which is not easy.) Now imagine that $n$ is large, and let $h=1/n$. Then $e^h$ should be about $1+1/n$, and the rest follows. But the details, such as making precise the weaselly \"should be about $1+1/n$,\" are not easy. In particular, we would have to define precisely the general exponential function. So unless we fill in a lot of detail, the above idea involves quite vigorous hand waving, diametrically opposite to the epsilon-delta approach.  However, the idea has useful intuitive content.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that (e^x - 1)/x approaches 1 as x approaches 0 using the epsilon-delta definition. They mentioned struggling with handling the |(e^x -1 -x)/x| < epsilon part. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the epsilon-delta definition. For every epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that whenever 0 < |x| < delta, |(e^x -1)/x - 1| < epsilon. Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value: (e^x -1)/x -1 = (e^x -1 -x)/x. So we need to make |(e^x -1 -x)/x| < epsilon.\n\nThe user is asking how to get this expression into a form that relates to |x|. Maybe they need to bound |e^x -1 -x| by some multiple of |x|^2, since dividing by |x| would leave a term proportional to |x|. Let's think about the Taylor series expansion of e^x around 0: e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... So e^x -1 -x = x^2/2 + x^3/6 + ... Therefore, (e^x -1 -x)/x = x/2 + x^2/6 + ... So the absolute value would be |x|/2 + |x|^2/6 + ... which for small x is approximately |x|/2. So if we can bound this by epsilon, then we can set delta to be something like 2epsilon. But wait, maybe we need to make sure that higher-order terms are negligible. Alternatively, using inequalities. For example, using the Taylor series with remainder. For x near 0, maybe e^x can be expressed as 1 + x + (x^2)/2 * e^c for some c between 0 and x. Then e^x -1 -x = (x^2)/2 e^c. Then |(e^x -1 -x)/x| = |x/2 e^c|. Since c is between 0 and x, if |x| < delta, then |c| < delta, so e^c < e^delta. If we choose delta < 1, then e^c < e^1 = e. So |x/2 * e^c| < (delta/2)*e. To make this less than epsilon, set (delta/2)*e <= epsilon, so delta <= 2epsilon/e. But since we also need delta <=1 to ensure e^c < e, then delta would be the minimum of 1 and 2epsilon/e. That seems like a valid approach. But does the user know about Taylor's theorem with remainder? Maybe they're in calc 1 and haven't covered that yet. Alternatively, use the definition of derivative. Since the limit as x approaches 0 of (e^x -1)/x is the derivative of e^x at 0, which is 1. But the user specifically wants to use epsilon-delta, not the derivative definition. Another approach: use the inequality that for x near 0, e^x can be bounded by 1 + x + x^2. Wait, maybe using the mean value theorem. Let’s see. Let’s write e^x -1 = x*e^c for some c between 0 and x. Then (e^x -1)/x = e^c. So the limit as x approaches 0 is e^0 =1. But again, that uses the mean value theorem, which might be a different approach than epsilon-delta. The user wants to use the epsilon-delta directly. So going back to the expansion. If we can bound |e^x -1 -x| <= C x^2 for some constant C when |x| is small, then |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <= C |x|. Then to make this < epsilon, we can set |x| < epsilon/C. So delta would be epsilon/C. But how to establish that bound without using Taylor's theorem. Maybe using the definition of e^x as a power series and truncating it. For |x| <1, e^x =1 +x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... So |e^x -1 -x| <= |x|^2/2 + |x|^3/6 + ... <= |x|^2/2 (1 + |x| + |x|^2 + ... ) = |x|^2/2 * 1/(1 - |x|) if |x| <1. Wait, but that sum is a geometric series. So for |x| <1/2, 1/(1 - |x|) <=2. So |e^x -1 -x| <= |x|^2/2 *2 = |x|^2. Therefore, |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <= |x|. So if we set delta to be min(1/2, epsilon), then when |x| < delta, |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <= |x| < epsilon. Wait, that seems too good. Let me check again. If |x| <1/2, then the sum 1 + |x| + |x|^2 + ... = 1/(1 - |x|) < 2. So |e^x -1 -x| <= |x|^2 (1/2 + |x|/6 + |x|^2/24 + ...) < |x|^2 (1/2 + 1/12 + 1/96 + ...) < |x|^2 (1/2 + 1/12 + 1/48 + ...). Let's compute that series: 1/2 +1/12 +1/48 +... Let's see, after 1/2, each term is multiplied by 1/6, then 1/4? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a better bound. Since for |x| <1/2, each term |x|^k/(k+2)! <= (1/2)^k / (k+2)!), which is very small. So maybe |e^x -1 -x| <= |x|^2 (1/2 + 1/6 + 1/24 + ... ) <= |x|^2 (e -2) approximately? Because e =1 +1 +1/2! +1/3! + ... so e -2 =1/2 +1/6 +1/24 + ... ≈0.718... So |e^x -1 -x| <= |x|^2*(e -1) perhaps? Not sure. But even if we take the first term |x|^2/2, then |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <= |x|/2. So to make |x|/2 < epsilon, we set |x| <2epsilon. Therefore, delta=2epsilon. But this requires that our initial assumption holds, which is that the remainder is bounded by |x|^2/2. But how to justify that without using Taylor's theorem. Maybe the user hasn't learned that yet. Alternatively, using the definition of e^x as the limit of (1 +x/n)^n. Not sure. Alternatively, using the inequality e^x >=1 +x for all x, which is known. But that might not help directly. Another approach: use the mean value theorem for the function f(x)=e^x. Then f(x) - f(0) = f’(c)x for some c between 0 and x. So e^x -1 = e^c x. Then (e^x -1)/x = e^c. As x approaches 0, c approaches 0, so e^c approaches 1. But this shows the limit is 1, but to frame it in epsilon-delta terms: Given epsilon >0, since e^c is continuous at 0, there exists delta>0 such that if |c| < delta, |e^c -1| < epsilon. Then since |c| < |x| when x is approaching 0, set delta such that when |x| < delta, |c| < delta, so |e^c -1| < epsilon. Hence, |(e^x -1)/x -1| = |e^c -1| < epsilon. Therefore, delta can be chosen as the same delta from the continuity of e^c at 0. But this is somewhat circular because we need to know that e^x is continuous, which might be assumed in the course. However, the user is in calc 1, and maybe they can use this approach. But the problem is that the user wants to do it directly using epsilon-delta, not via the MVT or continuity. So perhaps the answer should proceed by using the Taylor expansion and bound the remainder, assuming that's permissible. Alternatively, using the definition of the derivative. The limit is f’(0) where f(x)=e^x. Since f’(0)=1, but again, the user wants to use epsilon-delta. Maybe combine both. If they can accept that e^x is differentiable at 0 with derivative 1, then the epsilon-delta would follow. But the user wants to prove it from scratch. So going back to the original problem. The user's work in the image (which I can't see) might have tried manipulating the inequality |(e^x -1)/x -1| < epsilon. So simplifying that to |(e^x -1 -x)/x| < epsilon. Then they need to find a delta such that when |x| < delta, this inequality holds. The key is to bound |e^x -1 -x| in terms of |x|^2. If they can show that |e^x -1 -x| <= C|x|^2 for some constant C when |x| is small, then |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <= C|x|, and then choosing delta = epsilon/C would work. So the task is to find such a C and delta. For example, using the Taylor series, as I did before, but maybe they need to use known inequalities. Alternatively, use the fact that for |x| <1, e^x <=1 +x +x^2. Let me check: For x>0, e^x =1 +x +x^2/2! +x^3/3! +... <1 +x +x^2(1/2 +1/4 +1/8 +...) =1 +x +x^2(1). So e^x <1 +x +x^2 for 0 <x <1. Similarly for x<0, e^x =1 +x +x^2/2 - ... but since it's alternating, perhaps a different bound. Alternatively, for |x| <1, e^x <=1 +x +x^2. Then e^x -1 -x <=x^2. Hence, |e^x -1 -x| <=x^2 for |x| <1. Therefore, |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <= |x|. So to make this < epsilon, set delta = min(1, epsilon). Then for |x| < delta, |x| <1 and |x| < epsilon, so |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <=|x| <epsilon. Wait, this seems to work. But does the inequality e^x <=1 +x +x^2 hold for |x| <1? Let me test x=0.5: e^0.5≈1.6487. 1 +0.5 +0.25=1.75. Yes, 1.6487 <1.75. For x=0.1: e^0.1≈1.10517, 1 +0.1 +0.01=1.11. Yes, 1.10517 <1.11. For x= -0.5: e^{-0.5}≈0.6065, 1 -0.5 +0.25=0.75. 0.6065 <0.75. So seems to hold. So maybe we can use this inequality. Therefore, for |x| <1, |e^x -1 -x| <=x^2. Therefore, |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <= |x|. Hence, given epsilon >0, choose delta = min(1, epsilon). Then when |x| <delta, |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <=|x| <epsilon. Therefore, this works. But does the user know that e^x <=1 +x +x^2 for |x| <1? Maybe they need to prove that inequality first. Alternatively, use the Taylor series and bound the remainder. Either way, this seems like a path forward. So the key steps are:\n\n1. Establish that for |x| <1, e^x -1 -x <=x^2.\n\n2. Then |(e^x -1 -x)/x| <= |x|.\n\n3. Set delta = min(1, epsilon).\n\nThen when |x| < delta, the expression is bounded by epsilon.\n\nSo the assumptions needed are:\n\n- x is a real number approaching 0, so x ≠0.\n\n- The inequality e^x <=1 +x +x^2 holds for |x| <1. (This might be an assumption or need to be proven, but since the user is in calc 1, maybe they can take this as given or use the Taylor series approximation.)\n\nBut in terms of assumptions for the problem, the original problem is to prove the limit using epsilon-delta. So the problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- The function is defined as (e^x -1)/x for x ≠0.\n\n- The limit is considered as x approaches 0.\n\nSo the formatted problem should capture these assumptions. The user didn't mention any restrictions on x other than approaching 0. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx approaches 0,\nx is not equal to 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve using the epsilon-delta definition that $$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1.$$\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions listed specific conditions on the variables (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the main assumptions are about x approaching 0, being real, and not equal to 0. But perhaps in the problem structure, we need to list each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx approaches 0,\nx is not equal to 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1$$ using the epsilon-delta definition of a limit.\n\nYes, that seems appropriate. The assumptions ensure that x is in the domain of the function (x≠0), and that we're considering the real limit as x approaches 0.",
