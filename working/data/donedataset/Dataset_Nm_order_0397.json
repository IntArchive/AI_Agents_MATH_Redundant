    "Content": "Let $K$ be a field and let $K(x)$ be the field of rational functions in $x$ whose coefficients are in $K$. Let $\\theta(x)$ $\\in \\operatorname{Aut}(K(x))$ such that $\\theta|_K = \\operatorname{id}_K$.  Show that $\\theta(x) =\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$, with $ad\\neq bc$. Here is my attempt. Let $\\theta(x) = \\frac{f}{g}$, $f,g \\in K[x]$, with $\\gcd(f, g)=1$. let $h \\in K(x)$. Then  $h(\\frac{f}{g}) = x$ and $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\neq\\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}$ if $x\\neq y$ . Suppose $\\deg f \\gt 1$ or $\\deg g \\gt 1$, then the equation $g(x)b=f(x)$, $b\\in K$,  will have more than one solution for $x$. Hence $f$ and $g$ have degrees at most $1$ and thus $\\theta(x)=\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$ with inverse function $\\theta(x) =\\frac{dx-b}{a-cx}$. What I'd like to know is if Ive approached the problem in the right manner. Please any input will be very much appreciated. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is unclear to me on what grounds you claim that $g(x)b=f(x)$ will have more than one solution for $x$ . Even assuming that $K$ were algebraically closed, how do you know that you don't have one solution which is a multiple solution? For a very simple example, consider the case of $K=\\mathbf{F}_2$ , the field with two elements, and take $g(x) = x^2+x+1$ and $f(x)=x$ . Then $g(x)0 = f(x)$ has one solution ( $x=0$ ) and $g(x)1 = f(x)$ has one solution ( $x=1$ ), so it does not follow merely from the degrees of $f$ and $g$ : there is more work to be done. I don't know for sure if you can push it through, but you are correct that the first step is showing that the degrees have to be at most one. I know two proofs: a direct way and a clever way. The direct way is to start as you do, with $\\theta(x)=\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ , with $f$ and $g$ coprime. Then consider an $\\alpha = p(x)/q(x)$ , with $p$ and $q$ coprime. If you write $f(x) = a_nx^n+\\cdots +a_0$ and $g(x)=b_nx^n+\\cdots+b_0$ , with $a_n$ and $b_n$ not both zero, and you write $p(x) = c_mx^m+\\cdots+c_0$ , $q(x) = d_mx^m+\\cdots+d_0$ , with $c_m$ and $d_m$ not both zero, then you can think about the degrees of the numerator and denominator of $\\theta(\\alpha)$ . Try to think about what you would need for the degrees to drop after applying $\\theta$ in order to conclude information about what can map to $x$ under $\\theta$ . From there what you want will follow. This proof basically amounts to working things through in the obvious manner until you get to where you want to go. Details Added. Pick any $\\alpha=p(x)/q(x)$ that is written as above; then $$\\begin{align*}\n\\theta(\\alpha) &= \\frac{c_m\\theta(x)^m + \\cdots + c_0}{d_m\\theta(x)^m+\\cdots + d_0}\\\\\n&= \\frac{c_mf^mg^0 + \\cdots + c_0g^m}{d_mf^mg^0+\\cdots + d_0g^m}.\n\\end{align*}$$ I claim that this is written in lowest terms: since $p$ and $q$ are coprime, we can find polynomials $r(x)$ and $s(x)$ with coefficients in $K$ such that $r(x)p(x)+q(x)r(x) = 1$ . Applying $\\theta$ and clearing denominators, we obtain a linear combination of $$c_mf^mg^0+\\cdots + c_0g^m\\quad\\text{and}\\quad d_mf^mg^0+\\cdots+d_0g^m$$ which is equal to some power of $g$ ; thus, if there is any common factor among the numerator and denominator, it must be a divisors of a power of $g(x)$ . But let $k(x)$ be a divisors of $g$ that divides both numerator and denominator of $\\theta(\\alpha)$ . Since either $c_m\\neq 0$ or $d_m\\neq 0$ , then $k(x)$ must divide $f^m(x)$ . Since $g(x)$ and $f(x)$ are relatively prime, it follows that $k(x)=1$ . Thus, the rational function $\\theta(\\alpha)$ is already expressed in lowest terms. The degree of the numerator of this fraction is at most $mn$ , and is strictly smaller than $mn$ if and only if the coefficient of $x^{mn}$ , which is $c_ma_n^m +c_{m-1}a_n^{m-1}b_m+ \\cdots + c_0b_n^m$ , vanishes. The denominator has degree at most $mn$ , and the degree is strictly smaller if and only if the coefficient of $x^{mn}$ in the expression, which is $d_ma_n^m + \\cdots + d_0b_n^m$ , is equal to $0$ . Suppose first that $b_n\\neq 0$ . Then the numerator has degree strictly smaller than $mn$ if and only if $\\frac{a_n}{b_n}$ is a root of $p(x)$ ; and the degree of the denominator is strictly less than $mn$ if and only if $\\frac{a_n}{b_n}$ is a root of $q(x)$ . Since these two polynomials are coprime, they cannot have a common root; thus, we cannot have both numerator and denominator of degree strictly less than $mn$ , so at least one of them has degree exactly $mn$ . Suppose next that $b_n=0$ . Then the numerator has degree strictly smaller than $mn$ if and only if $c_ma_n^m=0$ , which requires $c_m=0$ since $b_n$ and $a_n$ are not both equal to zero. Similarly, the degree of the denominator is strictly smaller than $mn$ if and only if $d_ma_n^m=0$ , which requires $d_m=0$ . But since we cannot have both $c_m$ and $d_m$ equal to zero, at least one of the numerator and denominator has degree exactly $mn$ . Since $\\theta$ is assumed to be an isomorphism, there has to be an $\\alpha$ such that $\\theta(\\alpha)=x$ . Proceeding as above, since the expression is written in lowest terms and the degree of at least one of the numerator and denominator is $mn$ , it follows that we must have $mn=1$ , or $m=n=1$ . That is, $\\theta$ must be defined as $$\\theta(x) = \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d},$$ with $ax+b$ and $cx+d$ coprime, $a$ and $c$ not both equal to zero. From here it is straightforward to finish the problem. $\\Box$ The second proof I know is the \"clever proof\". Again, take $\\theta(x)=\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ as you do. Note that $\\theta(x)\\notin K$ . Show that $\\theta(x)$ is transcendental over $K$ by showing that $x$ is algebraic over $K(\\theta(x))$ , and find its irreducible polynomial. Then use the fact that $K(\\theta(x))$ is isomorphic to $K(x)$ to deduce that the irreducible polynomial must be of degree $1$ . The irreducible polynomial turns out to be closely related to $f$ and $g$ , of course. (I also like the fact that Gauss's Lemma comes into play to show that the obvious polynomial satisfied by $\\theta(x)$ is in fact irreducible in the field you are looking at). The argument proceeds as follows: again, pick any $\\beta = p(x)/q(x)$ written in lowest terms. The polynomial $\\beta q(y) - p(y)\\in K(\\alpha)[y]$ has $x$ as a root, so $x$ is algebraic over $K(\\beta)$ (since $p$ and $q$ are coprime, the polynomial is not equal to $0$ ). It follows that $\\alpha$ is transcendental over $K$ . I claim the polynomial $\\beta q(y)-p(y)$ is irreducible in $K(\\beta)[y]$ . Indeed, this polynomial is irreducible over $K(\\beta)[y]$ if and only if it is irreducible over $K[\\beta][y]$ by Gauss's Lemma; but $K[\\beta][y]=K[y][\\beta]$ , and this polynomial is trivially irreducible over $K[y][\\beta]$ because it is linear in $\\beta$ and the two coefficients are relatively prime in $K[y]$ . Therefore, $[K(x):K(\\beta)] = \\max(\\deg(p),\\deg(q))$ . So, if $\\theta$ defined by $\\theta(x)=\\beta$ gives an automorphism, then we must have $1=[K(x):K(\\beta)] = \\max(\\deg(p),\\deg(q))$ . Hence $\\theta(x) = \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$ and the argument finishes as before. $\\Box$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that any automorphism θ of the field K(x) that fixes K element-wise must be of the form (ax + b)/(cx + d) with ad ≠ bc. They attempted a proof by expressing θ(x) as a rational function f/g, assuming h(f/g) = x for some h, and arguing about the degrees of f and g. Let me parse through their approach and the problem's requirements.\n\nFirst, the problem states that θ is an automorphism of K(x), the field of rational functions over K. Automorphisms must be bijective homomorphisms, so θ must preserve the field operations and be invertible. The condition θ|_K = id_K means θ acts as the identity on constants, so for any a in K, θ(a) = a. The goal is to show θ(x) is a Möbius transformation (linear fractional transformation) with the determinant condition ad - bc ≠ 0.\n\nLooking at the user's attempt: They set θ(x) = f/g with f, g in K[x], coprime. Then they mention h(f/g) = x, implying that h is the inverse function of θ, since applying θ followed by h gives x. Then they argue that if deg f or deg g is greater than 1, the equation g(x)b = f(x) would have multiple solutions, leading to a contradiction on injectivity. Hence, f and g must be linear, leading to θ(x) being of the desired form.\n\nWait, the user's reasoning seems to hinge on the inverse function existing and being a rational function. For θ to be an automorphism, it must indeed have an inverse in Aut(K(x)). The user's key step is considering the degree of f and g. If θ(x) = f/g is invertible as a rational function, then its inverse must also be a rational function. But in general, the inverse of a rational function need not be rational unless it's a Möbius transformation. So if f/g has degree higher than 1, its inverse would involve solving a higher-degree equation, which might not be expressible as a rational function, hence contradicting the bijectivity required for an automorphism. Therefore, the degrees of f and g must be at most 1. That seems to be the crux.\n\nBut let me verify if this approach is valid. Suppose θ(x) = f/g where f and g are coprime polynomials. For θ to be invertible, there must exist some h ∈ K(x) such that h(θ(x)) = x. If h is a rational function, then composing θ and h gives x. If f/g has degree greater than 1, then h would need to be a rational function that undoes that, which is only possible if the composition's degree is 1. The composition of two rational functions has degree equal to the product of their degrees. So if θ(x) is of degree d > 1, then h must be of degree 1/d, which isn't possible. Therefore, d must be 1. Hence, f and g must be linear. So the user's approach seems correct.\n\nHowever, the problem statement in the original question might not explicitly assume that the inverse is a rational function, but since θ is an automorphism of K(x), the inverse must indeed be a rational function, so that part is justified.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the required format. The original problem mentions K is a field, θ is in Aut(K(x)), θ restricts to identity on K, and needs to show θ(x) is a Möbius transformation with ad ≠ bc. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n- K is a field.\n- K(x) is the field of rational functions in x over K.\n- θ is an element of Aut(K(x)) (i.e., θ is a field automorphism of K(x)).\n- θ restricted to K is the identity automorphism on K (θ fixes K element-wise).\n- θ(x) is a rational function in K(x).\n\nProblem: Show that θ(x) must be of the form (ax + b)/(cx + d) where a, b, c, d ∈ K and ad ≠ bc.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user didn't state θ(x) is a rational function; that's part of what needs to be shown. Wait, θ is an automorphism of K(x), so by definition, it's a bijective homomorphism from K(x) to itself. Since K(x) consists of rational functions, θ must map x to some element of K(x), i.e., a rational function θ(x). So θ is determined by its action on x, and since it's a homomorphism fixing K, θ is determined by θ(x). So the key is to show that θ(x) must be a linear fractional transformation.\n\nSo the assumptions are K is a field, θ is an automorphism of K(x), θ fixes K pointwise. The problem is to show θ(x) is of the form (ax + b)/(cx + d) with ad ≠ bc.\n\nThe user's attempt starts by writing θ(x) as f/g with f, g coprime, then considering the inverse function. The user assumes that h(f/g) = x, which would be the inverse map. Then they argue about the degrees of f and g. So their approach is valid if they can show that higher degrees lead to non-injectivity, which would contradict θ being an automorphism (since automorphisms must be bijective). However, the user mentions that if deg f >1 or deg g >1, then the equation g(x)b = f(x) has more than one solution. Wait, maybe they're considering that if θ is not injective, which can't happen because field automorphisms are injective by definition. Alternatively, perhaps they're considering the inverse function's existence requiring the equation θ(x) = constant to have multiple solutions? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that if θ(x) = f/g is a rational function of degree >1, then the field extension K(x)/K(θ(x)) would be of degree >1, implying that K(x) is not generated by θ(x), which contradicts that θ is an automorphism (since automorphisms must generate the whole field). That might be a more algebraic approach. But maybe the user's approach is more elementary.\n\nIn any case, the key points for the formatted problem are the assumptions about K being a field, θ being an automorphism of K(x) fixing K, and the problem being to show θ(x) is a Möbius transformation with the determinant condition.",
