    "Content": "I am really sure that if two sets have the same power set, then they are the same set. I just am wondering how does one exactly go about proving/showing this? I'm usually wrong, so if anyone can show me an example where this fails, I'd like that too. The homework just asks for true/false, but I'm wanting to show it if possible. My thoughts are that since the power set is by definition the set of all subsets of a set, if each of the two power sets are identical, we have an identity map between each set, thus it's indistinguishable which power set is a given set's power set. I hope that wasn't verbose. Since a set has only one power set, we can conclude they are in fact the same set.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. Let me read through the original problem again.\n\nThe user is asking whether if two sets have the same power set, then they must be the same set. They believe it's true but want to know how to prove it or see a counterexample if it's false. The homework question is a true/false type, but they want to understand the reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The main assumption here is that two sets have the same power set. The problem is to prove or disprove that these two sets are equal.\n\nWait, the example given in the original instruction mentioned listing each assumption line by line, addressing one property per line. In the example, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by $7$\" as separate assumptions. So for this problem, the key assumption is that two sets have the same power set. But since the problem is about two sets, maybe I should specify that there are two sets involved.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. There exist two sets, let's call them A and B.\n2. The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nThe problem then is to prove or disprove that A equals B.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the first assumption is the existence of two sets. Wait, maybe the original problem doesn't mention two sets explicitly, but the question is about two sets. So perhaps the assumption is that two sets have the same power set, and the problem is to show they are the same set.\n\nBut how to phrase the assumptions? Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate line. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: \n- There are two sets A and B.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that A and B are the same set.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"if two sets have the same power set then they are the same set\". So maybe the assumptions are that two sets have the same power set, and the problem is to prove they are equal. The user is asking to prove or find a counterexample, but in the problem statement, it's phrased as \"Prove/Disprove...\". But according to the example, the problem part should state the problem as given. So the original question is \"Prove/Disprove that if two sets have the same power set then they are the same set\".\n\nBut the user's own problem statement in the example was structured as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps here, the problem should be \"Prove or disprove that if two sets have the same power set, then they are the same set\".\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, they want the problem structured in the given format. Let me look at the example again. The example's formatted problem was:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem here, the user's question is about proving or disproving a statement. However, the example only used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the problem part here should be \"Prove or disprove that...\".\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Prove/Disprove that if two sets have the same power set then they are the same set\". So the problem statement is exactly that.\n\nSo, following the format, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The problem is structured as \"if two sets have the same power set, then they are the same set\". Therefore, the assumption here is that two sets have the same power set, and the problem is to prove they are the same set.\n\nWait, but in logical terms, the problem is to show that if Pow(A) = Pow(B), then A = B. So the assumption is that Pow(A) = Pow(B), and the problem is to conclude A = B.\n\nBut how to list the assumptions? Each line should address one property or condition applied to one object. So the two sets A and B are given, and their power sets are equal.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem statement, the user is considering the general case, not specific sets. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- There exist two sets A and B.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A and B are the same set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption is just that the power sets are equal, and the problem is to prove the sets are equal. But in terms of the problem structure, the user's example listed the assumptions as specific conditions on the variables. So for this problem, the key assumption is that two sets have the same power set. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- For two sets A and B, the power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nBut the example separated each assumption line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let A and B be two sets.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A and B are the same set.\n\nBut the original problem is phrased as \"if two sets have the same power set, then they are the same set\". So the problem is to prove that implication. Therefore, the assumptions are the antecedent (if part), and the problem is to show the consequent (then part).\n\nIn the example given by the user, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the assumptions are the conditions given, and the problem is to show the conclusion.\n\nSimilarly here, the assumptions are the conditions (two sets have same power set), and the problem is to prove they are the same set. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Two sets A and B have the same power set.\n\nProblem: Prove that A and B are the same set.\n\nBut wait, in the example, each assumption is a separate line. So \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, perhaps \"Two sets A and B exist\" and \"Power set of A equals power set of B\" as separate assumptions. But the problem statement in the example didn't list existence as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the problem was about \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So here, the existence of A and B is implied in the problem statement. The key assumption is that their power sets are equal. But in terms of the format, maybe just list the key condition as the assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- Two sets have the same power set.\n\nProblem: Prove that the two sets are equal.\n\nAlternatively, to be precise, since the problem is about two sets, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- For sets A and B, the power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A = B.\n\nBut to follow the example's structure, each assumption is a separate line. In this case, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exist two sets A and B.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A equals B.\n\nBut does the first assumption \"There exist two sets A and B\" necessary? Because the problem is about any two sets that satisfy the condition. But in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", which is part of the problem statement \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, the first assumption is that A and B are sets, and the second is that their power sets are equal. However, in the original problem, the user's question is general: \"if two sets have the same power set, then they are the same set\". So the antecedent is \"two sets have the same power set\", and the conclusion is \"they are the same set\". Therefore, the key assumption is that their power sets are equal. The fact that they are sets is part of the context, not an additional assumption.\n\nBut in the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So maybe here, the assumptions are:\n\n- A and B are sets.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A equals B.\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"A and B are sets\" is considered an assumption here. In set theory, when we talk about power sets, we are already assuming they are sets. The original question is in the context of set theory, so perhaps the key assumption is just that the power sets are equal. But the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem was \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, the first assumption is \"A and B are sets\", and the second is \"power set of A equals power set of B\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the example, the user considered that the problem stated \"for every integer n\", but the assumptions listed were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. Then in the example's formatted problem, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. It should be that the assumption is \"n is an integer\", and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the user formatted it with two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7. But 91 is 13*7, so maybe there was a mistake in the example. Perhaps the original problem was supposed to have n divisible by 7? Or maybe the user made an error in the example.\n\nBut regardless, following that example structure, for the current problem, the key is to list each assumption line by line. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- Two sets A and B exist.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A and B are the same set.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user's question is \"Prove/Disprove that if two sets have the same power set then they are the same set\". So the format should capture the conditional: if (power sets are equal) then (sets are equal). Therefore, the assumption is the hypothesis of the implication, which is that the power sets are equal, and the problem is to prove the conclusion that the sets are equal.\n\nSo translating that into the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- The power set of set A is equal to the power set of set B.\n\nProblem: Prove that set A is equal to set B.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to list the existence of A and B as separate assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- A and B are sets.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A equals B.\n\nBut since in the original problem, the existence of two sets is part of the hypothesis (\"if two sets have the same power set\"), perhaps the first assumption is that there are two sets, and the second is their power sets being equal.\n\nHowever, in standard mathematical logic, when we say \"if P, then Q\", the assumption is P, and we need to prove Q. So the assumption here is that two sets have the same power set, and the problem is to prove they are equal. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- Two sets have the same power set.\n\nProblem: Prove that the two sets are equal.\n\nBut to be more precise in terms of the structure, following the example where each assumption is applied to one object, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let A and B be sets.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A = B.\n\nThis seems accurate. The first assumption is that A and B are sets (objects in consideration), and the second is the specific condition (their power sets are equal). Then the problem is to show they are equal.\n\nSo following this structure, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let A and B be two sets.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A equals B.\n\nAlternatively, to match the original problem's title, which is \"Prove/Disprove that if two sets have the same power set then they are the same set\", perhaps the problem statement should be phrased as \"Prove or disprove that A equals B\". But according to the example, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that...\". However, in the example, the user's formatted problem had \"Prove that...\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". The example's assumptions included \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be an error. \n\nBut given the user's example, perhaps the problem part should be \"Prove that...\" even if the original question is \"Prove/Disprove\". However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as the example. In the example, the original problem said \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem said \"Prove that...\". Here, the original problem is \"Prove/Disprove...\", but according to the user's example, they might expect the problem part to be \"Prove that...\", but maybe the correct approach is to mirror the original problem's phrasing. However, the example might have been a simplification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem part should mirror exactly what the original question is asking. In the original example, the user's formatted problem changed \"for every integer n\" into assumptions and problem statement. But perhaps the answerer is supposed to filter out the unrelated information and structure it as assumptions and problem. In this case, the original question is asking to prove or disprove the statement, so the problem part should be \"Prove or disprove that...\".\n\nBut the user's example turned \"for every integer n\" into an assumption \"n is an integer\" and added another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems like a mistake unless the original problem had a different condition. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example was supposed to have n divisible by 7? Let me check again.\n\nThe original problem in the example was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem was to show divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by both 7 and 13? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the example. This confusion suggests that perhaps the example was not perfectly structured, but we have to follow the user's format regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the current problem should have the assumptions listed as:\n\nAssumption:\n- Two sets A and B have the same power set.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that A and B are the same set.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is \"Prove that...\", but the original question here is \"Prove/Disprove...\". Since the user's instruction says to structure it as per the example, maybe the answer should follow the example's style, which for the original problem here would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Two sets have the same power set.\n\nProblem: Prove that the two sets are the same set.\n\nBut the original question is framed as a prove/disprove, which is more of a true/false with justification. However, in the example, the problem was presented as \"Prove that...\", even though the original problem might have had other nuances. Given that the user's example formatted a general statement with specific assumptions, perhaps here the problem should be stated as \"Prove that...\" since the user believes it's true, but the answer should reflect the actual problem's requirement. However, the instruction is to structure the problem as per the example, so we'll follow that.\n\nPutting it all together, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- Two sets have the same power set.\n\nProblem: Prove that the two sets are the same set.\n\nAlternatively, to be more precise with the sets:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let A and B be sets.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A equals B.\n\nThis seems more in line with the example, where each assumption is a separate line addressing one property or object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let A and B be sets.\n- The power set of A is equal to the power set of B.\n\nProblem: Prove that A = B.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is on a separate line, and the problem is clearly stated.",
