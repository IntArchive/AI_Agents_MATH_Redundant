    "Content": "Can anyone offer an elementary proof why: $$\\forall n \\in {\\mathbb Z} \\space \\exists a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h \\in {\\mathbb Z}$$such that$$n=a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3+e^3+f^3+g^3+h^3{\\rm ?}$$ In other words, why every integer is the sum of eight cubes integers. My first thought was that since the gaps between $p^3$ and $(p+1)^3$ increase with $p,$ this would only hold for small integers.  This is wrong; can anyone tell me why? N.B. This is different to Waring's problem because $n,a,b,c...$ dot not have to be natural numbers, so we can have $27=3^3+(-1)^3+(-1)^3+(-1)^3+(-1)^3$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Allowing negative cubes, five suffice. It is suspected that four suffice but this is an open problem. I will see if I can find the argument for five, it is just one or two explicit formulas. By the way, these are called the \"Easier\" Waring problems. Can't find them at this point, so here is section D5 form Richard K. Guy, Unsolved Problems in Number Theory. Note that he is allowing cubes to be positive, negative, or zero: Is every number the sum of four cubes? This has been proved for all\n  numbers except possibly those of the form $9n \\pm 4$ Part 1: $$ 6n = (n+1)^3 + (n-1)^3 - n^3 - n^3  $$ Part 2:\n$$ 6n - 2 = n^3 +(n+2)^3 - (n+1)^3 - (n+1)^3 - 2^3  $$ \n$$ 6n-1 =  (n+1)^3 + (n-1)^3 - n^3 - n^3 - 1^3  $$\n$$ 6n = (n+1)^3 + (n-1)^3 - n^3 - n^3  $$\n$$ 6n+1 =  (n+1)^3 + (n-1)^3 - n^3 - n^3 + 1^3  $$\n$$ 6n + 2 = n^3 +(n-2)^3 - (n-1)^3 - (n-1)^3 + 2^3  $$\n$$ 6n + 3 = (n-3)^3 +(n-5)^3 - (n-4)^3 - (n-4)^3 + 3^3  $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that any integer can be written as the sum of eight integer cubes. The user mentions that it's different from Waring's problem because here integers can be negative, not just natural numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that for every integer n, there exist eight integers a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h such that their cubes sum up to n. The assumptions should be each on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are that n is an integer, and each of the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers. However, the problem doesn't specify any additional conditions on n, like divisibility. So the main assumptions are about n being an integer and the existence of eight integers whose cubes sum to n. \n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\" but in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that example might be specific to the problem given. Let me check the original example again. The example problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake, or perhaps the user made a typo. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would actually change the problem. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example provided by the user, the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which would mean no additional assumptions. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions given. \n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange. The question is: Can any integer be written as the sum of 8 integer cubes? The problem statement is that for every integer n, there exist eight integers a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h such that n is the sum of their cubes. So the assumptions here are that n is an integer, and each of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers. But since the problem is about existence for all integers n, the main assumption is that n is an integer, and the variables a through h are integers. However, in the example, they listed each assumption line by line. So perhaps each variable's integrality is a separate assumption? But in the example, they only had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the original problem doesn't have any divisibility conditions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\nBut also, the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers. However, in the problem statement, the question is about existence of such integers. So perhaps the assumptions are only the conditions given in the problem. Wait, the problem is asking to prove that for all integers n, there exist integers a,...,h such that the sum of their cubes is n. So the assumptions would be that n is an integer. The problem is to show that there exist integers a,...,h (so their integrality is part of the problem's conclusion, not the assumption). Wait, perhaps the variables a,...,h are part of the existential quantifier in the problem, so they are not assumptions but variables to be found. Therefore, the only assumption here is that n is an integer. Because the problem is ∀n∈ℤ, ∃a,...,h∈ℤ such that n = sum of cubes. So the assumption is that n is an integer. The rest is part of the problem statement. \n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. So perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, the key is to list all assumptions. The user's problem here states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. The problem is to show that eight integer cubes can sum to n. So the variables a,...,h being integers is part of the existential quantifier in the problem statement, not the assumptions. Therefore, the only assumption is that n is an integer. \n\nWait, but the example had two assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. But perhaps in the original problem, the user intended to include that assumption. Let me check again. The original example's formatted problem says:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem was stated as \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" So the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was a mistake. So perhaps the user made an error in the example. Therefore, when applying the instructions, I need to be careful to list only the assumptions given in the original problem. \n\nIn the current problem, the original question is: Can any integer be written as the sum of 8 integer cubes? So the assumptions here are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\nBecause the problem is for all integers n, so the only assumption is that n is an integer. The variables a,...,h are part of the existential quantifier, so their integrality is part of the problem's requirements, not assumptions. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist integers a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h such that n = a³ + b³ + c³ + d³ + e³ + f³ + g³ + h³.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as the original question: Can any integer be written as the sum of eight integer cubes? In the example, the problem part restated the problem. \n\nBut let me check the original question's exact wording. The user wrote:\n\nProblem: Prove that $$A(n) = ...$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in the example, the problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, given that n is an integer divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo or the user made a mistake. But regardless, in the current problem, the user's question is:\n\nOriginal problem: Can any integer be written as the sum of 8 integer cubes?\n\nQuestion: Can anyone offer an elementary proof why: ∀n ∈ ℤ, ∃a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h ∈ ℤ such that n = sum of their cubes. The user clarifies that it's different from Waring's problem because integers can be negative.\n\nSo the assumptions here are that n is an integer. The rest is the problem to prove existence of the eight integers. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist integers a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h such that n = a³ + b³ + c³ + d³ + e³ + f³ + g³ + h³.\n\nAlternatively, keeping the original problem's wording: \"every integer is the sum of eight integer cubes.\" So the problem statement can be phrased as such.\n\nSo I think that's the correct formatting here. The key is to list all assumptions, each on a separate line, and then the problem. In this case, the only assumption is that n is an integer. The problem is to show that it can be expressed as the sum of eight cubes of integers.",
