    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the unit sphere S^n is an n-dimensional topological manifold. The definition provided states that a topological n-manifold is a Hausdorff space where each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-dimensional disc.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are the properties that S^n must satisfy to be a manifold. Let me list them:\n\n1. S^n is a Hausdorff space. Since it's a subset of R^{n+1} with the subspace topology, and R^{n+1} is Hausdorff, subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff. But maybe the user wants this as an explicit assumption.\n\n2. Each point in S^n has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-dimensional disc. The problem is to prove this, so this isn't an assumption but part of the problem. Wait, no—the definition is given, so the assumptions are the conditions from the definition that need to be verified for S^n.\n\nWait, the user's example had assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. The formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though it's part of the problem's premise. So in this case, the assumptions would be the properties that S^n must have according to the manifold definition, which are:\n\n- The space is Hausdorff.\n\n- Each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-dimensional disc.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove S^n is an n-manifold, those two conditions are the ones that need to be verified. However, the user's example included the assumptions as given conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So the assumptions are the given conditions, not the ones to prove.\n\nSo in this case, the original problem is: \"How can I prove that S^n is an n-manifold?\" The definition requires that it's Hausdorff and each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-disc. So the assumptions here would be the properties that S^n is a subset of R^{n+1} with the subspace topology, and perhaps that R^{n+1} is Hausdorff. Wait, maybe the assumptions are the given structures, like S^n is defined as the unit sphere in R^{n+1}, which is a Hausdorff space. Then the problem is to verify the two conditions. But according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions. Let's see the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made an error there. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Wait, perhaps the original example had a different problem. Let me check.\n\nThe user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That would narrow down the problem to n divisible by 7, but the original didn't have that. So either there's a mistake in the example, or perhaps the original problem was misstated. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to include a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. This is confusing. But according to the user's example, the formatted problem's assumptions include conditions beyond the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user wants to extract all implicit assumptions from the problem. But in this case, the example might be incorrect. However, regardless, I need to follow the user's format as per their instruction.\n\nSo for the current problem, the original question is asking to prove S^n is an n-manifold, which by definition is a Hausdorff space where each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-disc. Therefore, the assumptions here would be the properties that S^n is a Hausdorff space (inherited from R^{n+1}), and that each point has such a neighborhood. But since the problem is to prove that S^n is a manifold, the assumptions are the given structures, like S^n is the unit sphere in R^{n+1}, which is a Hausdorff space. But the problem is to verify the second condition. Wait, the Hausdorff condition is part of the definition, so to prove S^n is a manifold, we need to verify both that it's Hausdorff and the local homeomorphism. But maybe the user considers the Hausdorff property as given because it's a subspace of a Hausdorff space, so that's an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- S^n is a subset of R^{n+1} with the subspace topology.\n\n- R^{n+1} is a Hausdorff space.\n\nBut maybe the user wants more concise assumptions. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove S^n is a manifold, the necessary assumptions would be the conditions required by the definition. But in the example, the formatted assumptions included conditions from the problem statement. Wait, perhaps the user wants to list the given conditions as assumptions, and the problem is the conclusion to prove. So in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\", and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the example, the formatted problem also added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user intended that the problem was actually to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state that. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I should focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user's task is to structure the problem as per the format: list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object, then the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is: How to prove that S^n is an n-manifold? The definition given is that a n-manifold is a Hausdorff space where each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-disc.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- S^n is a Hausdorff space.\n\n- Each point of S^n has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-dimensional disc.\n\nBut wait, no, because the problem is to prove that S^n is a manifold, so those two are the conditions that need to be verified. Therefore, the assumptions would be the given structures that allow us to verify those conditions. For example:\n\n- S^n is equipped with the subspace topology from R^{n+1}.\n\n- R^{n+1} is a Hausdorff space.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants the problem's own assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the Hausdorff property is inherited, so the assumption is that S^n is a subspace of a Hausdorff space, hence Hausdorff. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing the local homeomorphism part. But according to the user's example, the assumptions included conditions that were given in the problem. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. So here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- S^n is defined as the unit sphere in R^{n+1}.\n\n- The space S^n is considered with the subspace topology.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that it's a Hausdorff space and each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-disc. But the problem statement in the original question is to prove that S^n is an n-manifold, which by definition requires both conditions. However, maybe the user wants to split the assumptions into parts. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove it's a manifold, the assumptions are the given data, and the problem is to verify the definition.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is to list the properties that are given as part of the problem's setup. The problem is to show S^n is an n-manifold. The setup is that S^n is the unit sphere in R^{n+1}. So assumptions could be:\n\n- S^n is the set {x ∈ R^{n+1} : |x| = 1}.\n\n- S^n is equipped with the subspace topology from R^{n+1}.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that S^n is an n-manifold (i.e., Hausdorff and each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-disc).\n\nBut in the user's example, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\", which was part of the problem's universal quantifier. So in this case, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- S^n is a topological space with the subspace topology inherited from R^{n+1}.\n\n- R^{n+1} is a Hausdorff space.\n\nBut I think the key is to list each assumption as a single line, each applying to one object. So for S^n to be a manifold, the problem is to verify the two conditions. But perhaps the user expects the assumptions to be the given premises, not the conditions to prove. So in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake unless the original problem had a typo. But perhaps in the example, the user intended to structure a problem where n is divisible by 7, even if the original didn't state that. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but we need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- S^n is a subset of R^{n+1} with the subspace topology.\n\n- The problem is to prove that S^n is a Hausdorff space and each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-dimensional disc.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove that S^n is an n-manifold, which by definition requires both conditions, maybe the assumptions are the components of the definition that need to be verified. However, according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions. So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- S^n is the unit sphere in R^{n+1}.\n\n- S^n is equipped with the subspace topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that S^n is an n-manifold, i.e., a Hausdorff space where each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-dimensional disc.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as the conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So here, the equivalent would be the structure of S^n as a subspace of R^{n+1}, which is Hausdorff. Therefore, the Hausdorff property is inherited, so maybe the assumption is that S^n is a subspace of a Hausdorff space, hence Hausdorff. Then the problem reduces to proving the local homeomorphism part. But the problem as stated in the original question is to prove both conditions. However, since in topology, subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff, that part is straightforward, and the main task is to show the local homeomorphism. But according to the problem statement, the user is to structure the problem, not solve it. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions as given conditions and the problem as what needs to be proven.\n\nIn the original question, the user wants to prove S^n is an n-manifold. The definition requires two things: Hausdorff and local Euclidean. The user might need to verify both, but perhaps the Hausdorff property is considered given because it's a subspace of R^{n+1}. Therefore, the assumption could be that S^n is a subspace of R^{n+1}, which is Hausdorff, hence S^n is Hausdorff. Then the problem is to show each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-disc. Alternatively, if the user wants to list both conditions as part of the problem, but according to the example, the assumptions are the premises. Let me re-examine the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which narrows it down. That suggests the user might have made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct problem is when n is divisible by 7. But regardless, for the current task, I need to follow the user's instruction to format the problem as per the example.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the assumptions should be the given conditions in the problem statement. The problem statement defines S^n as the unit sphere in R^{n+1}, and asks to prove it's an n-manifold, which requires it to be Hausdorff and locally Euclidean. Since the problem is to prove both, but in reality, the Hausdorff property is inherited, so perhaps the assumption is that S^n is a subspace of a Hausdorff space (R^{n+1}), hence Hausdorff. Then the problem is to show the local Euclidean part. But the original problem requires proving both. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- S^n is a subset of R^{n+1} with the subspace topology.\n\n- R^{n+1} is a Hausdorff space.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that S^n is an n-manifold (which would involve showing it's Hausdorff and locally Euclidean). However, since subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff, the Hausdorff property is automatically satisfied, so the main task is the local Euclidean part. But the problem as stated in the original question is to prove the entire definition, so the formatted problem should reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- S^n is the unit sphere in R^{n+1}.\n\n- S^n is equipped with the subspace topology.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that S^n is an n-manifold (Hausdorff and locally Euclidean of dimension n).\n\nBut the user's example listed the assumptions as conditions on the variables in the problem. Here, the conditions are the structure of S^n. So each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- S^n is the set {x ∈ R^{n+1} : |x| = 1}.\n\n- S^n is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from R^{n+1}.\n\n- R^{n+1} is a Hausdorff space.\n\nProblem: Prove that S^n is an n-manifold, i.e., a Hausdorff space where each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-dimensional disc.\n\nBut maybe the Hausdorff condition of R^{n+1} is an assumption, and since S^n is a subspace, it's Hausdorff. Then the problem reduces to proving the local homeomorphism. But the original problem's definition requires both, so the problem statement should encompass both. However, according to the example, the problem is to prove the divisibility by 91, with assumptions on n. So perhaps here, the assumptions are the structure of S^n and its topology, and the problem is to verify the manifold conditions.\n\nI think the correct formatting, following the user's example, would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- S^n is defined as {x ∈ R^{n+1} : |x| = 1}.\n\n- S^n is equipped with the subspace topology from R^{n+1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that S^n is an n-manifold (i.e., a Hausdorff space where each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-dimensional disc).\n\nBut the example included even the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps the user wants to extract all the underlying assumptions, including those that are implicitly given. In this case, S^n is a topological space with the subspace topology, which is Hausdorff because R^{n+1} is. Therefore, the Hausdorff property is an implicit assumption, and the problem is to prove the local Euclidean part. But the original problem requires proving both, so the formatted problem should include both. However, according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". Therefore, in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- S^n is a Hausdorff space.\n\n- Each point of S^n has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open n-dimensional disc.\n\nBut that's circular because those are the conditions to prove. Therefore, perhaps the user's example was incorrect, and the correct approach is to list the given structures as assumptions.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the appropriate assumptions are the definition of S^n and its topology, leading to the problem of verifying the manifold conditions.
