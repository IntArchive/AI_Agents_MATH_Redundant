    "Content": "How to prove that the $p$-adic units can be written as\n$$\\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times \\cong \\mu_{p-1}\\times(1 + p\\mathbb{Z}_p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/(p-1)\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_p$$\nwhere $\\mu_n$ is the $n$-th roots of unity in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$? Here $p>2$ is a prime number. Any hint or link would be helpful. Besides, it looks strange: why the units of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is isomorphic to some guy which looks bigger than $\\mathbb{Z}_p$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This must be covered in almost every text on the $p$ -adic numbers; I think the book of Gouvêa is the best of these. And your statement is not quite true: for $p=2$ , $\\mu_{p-1}$ is trivial all right, but the other part is isomorphic to $\\{\\pm1\\}\\times(1+4\\Bbb Z_2)$ . My tale below omits the story for $p=2$ , and you can fill this in yourself. First, you can consider the units, $\\Bbb Z_p^\\times$ , and reduce them modulo $p$ to the multiplicative group of $\\Bbb F_p\\cong\\Bbb Z/p\\Bbb Z$ . It’s cyclic of order $p-1$ , as I’m sure you know. So we have an exact sequence: $$\n0\\longrightarrow K\\longrightarrow\\Bbb Z_p^\\times\\longrightarrow\\Bbb F_p^\\times\\longrightarrow0\\,;\n$$ if you’re unfamiliar with the notation of exact sequences this merely says that there’s a surjective map from the middle term to the one to its right, with kernel equal to the one to its left. What’s the kernel? It’s the units that go to $1$ in the field $\\Bbb F_p$ , in other words $1+p\\Bbb Z_p$ . To prove that $\\Bbb Z_p^\\times$ is the direct product of the two things to either side of it, it’s enough to show that there’s a homomorphism from $\\Bbb F_p^\\times$ into it whose image hits $K$ only in the identity. This is the fun part: You can find $(p-1)$ -th roots of unity in $\\Bbb Z_p$ either by a routine application of any version of Hensel’s Lemma that you like, or, my favorite method, take an element of $\\Bbb F_p^\\times$ , lift it to any element of $\\Bbb Z_p$ that goes to it modulo $p$ , and take successive $p$ -th powers: $x\\mapsto x^p\\mapsto(x^p)^p\\mapsto\\cdots$ etc. I’ll leave it to you to show that this is a good convergent sequence, and its limit is clearly a suitable root of unity. Showing that the multiplicative group $1+p\\Bbb Z_p$ is isomorphic to the additive group $\\Bbb Z_p^+$ is rather less fun. To tell you the truth, when I first saw the logarithmic argument, I didn’t like it, but I now think it’s the best one. You have to convince yourself that as long as the series for $\\log(1+x)$ that you saw in Calculus is convergent, then $\\log\\bigl[(1+x)(1+y)\\bigr]=\\log(1+x)+\\log(1+y)$ , and for $x\\in p\\Bbb Z_p$ , the series is convergent. And the values of the log are all in $p\\Bbb Z_p\\cong\\Bbb Z_p$ (as additive groups, of course), and fill out that group.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can filter out unrelated information and present the problem with clear assumptions and the main question.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question from Math Stack Exchange carefully. The title is \"Units of p-adic integers,\" and the user is asking how to prove that the p-adic units can be written as a specific isomorphism involving the roots of unity and a subgroup. They also mention that p is a prime greater than 2 and express confusion about why the units seem isomorphic to something \"bigger\" than Z_p.\n\nSo, the main problem is to prove the given isomorphism for the units of Z_p. The assumptions here are that p is a prime number and p > 2. The user also references mu_{p-1} as the (p-1)th roots of unity in Z_p. Additionally, the structure 1 + pZ_p is mentioned, which is a multiplicative subgroup of the units.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse that. The key assumptions are:\n\n1. p is a prime number.\n2. p > 2.\n3. mu_{p-1} is the group of (p-1)th roots of unity in Z_p.\n4. 1 + pZ_p is a subgroup of Z_p^x (the units).\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions the isomorphism Z_p^x ≅ mu_{p-1} x (1 + pZ_p) ≅ Z/(p-1)Z x Z_p. The user is asking for a proof of this. So the assumptions would include the properties of mu_{p-1}, the structure of 1 + pZ_p, and the conditions on p (prime and greater than 2). Also, the problem itself is about the isomorphism, so the assumptions need to cover the components of that isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a prime number,\n- p > 2,\n- μ_{p−1} is the group of (p−1)-th roots of unity in ℤ_p,\n- 1 + pℤ_p is a subgroup of ℤ_p^×.\n\nProblem: Prove that ℤ_p^× ≅ μ_{p−1} × (1 + pℤ_p) ≅ ℤ/(p−1)ℤ × ℤ_p.\n\nI need to check if these assumptions are all mentioned in the original problem. The user states \"Here p > 2 is a prime number,\" so that's two separate assumptions. The definitions of μ_{p−1} and 1 + pℤ_p are part of the problem's context. The user didn't state those as given, but since they are part of the isomorphism statement, maybe those are part of the problem's setup. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking to prove the structure, so perhaps the definitions of μ and 1+pZ_p are part of the problem's components to be established. However, in the example given, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, even though in the original problem it wasn't mentioned, but in the example, maybe that was inferred. Wait, no, in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem didn't specify that n is divisible by 7; the user's example added that. Wait, maybe that was an error in the example. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n,\" so why is the formatted problem adding that n is divisible by 7? That might be a mistake. But perhaps the original problem had an unstated assumption that n is divisible by 7? Or perhaps the example is incorrect. Hmm. But the user provided that example as their own structuring, so maybe they made a mistake. Anyway, I need to follow the user's instruction, which is to extract the assumptions from the original problem and list them line by line.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wrote: \"Here p>2 is a prime number.\" So the assumptions are p is prime, p>2. The other parts like μ_{p-1} and 1 + pZ_p are part of the structure to be proven, so they are not assumptions but components of the problem. Unless the problem is assuming those structures exist. Wait, the problem is to prove the isomorphism. So the definitions of μ_{p−1} and 1 + pZ_p are given as part of the problem's context. Therefore, we should include them as assumptions.\n\nFor example, the problem statement says \"the p-adic units can be written as...\" so the structure is part of what's to be proven. The user also mentions that μ_n is the n-th roots of unity in Z_p. So in the problem, μ_{p-1} is defined as the (p-1)th roots of unity in Z_p. Therefore, that's an assumption about μ_{p-1}. Similarly, 1 + pZ_p is a multiplicative subgroup, which is part of the problem's setup.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a prime number.\n- p > 2.\n- μ_{p−1} is the group of (p−1)-th roots of unity in ℤ_p.\n- 1 + pℤ_p is a multiplicative subgroup of ℤ_p^×.\n\nBut wait, is the third assumption given in the problem or is it part of what needs to be proven? The problem states \"the p-adic units can be written as... μ_{p-1} × (1 + pℤ_p)\", so perhaps the problem is assuming that μ_{p-1} exists as the roots of unity in ℤ_p. Similarly, 1 + pℤ_p is a standard notation for the subgroup of units congruent to 1 modulo p. So these are standard definitions in the context, so the problem is using these terms as given.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include the definitions of μ_{p−1} and 1 + pℤ_p as part of the problem's setup. So in the assumptions, we list:\n\n- p is a prime number,\n- p > 2,\n- μ_{p−1} is the group of (p−1)-th roots of unity in ℤ_p,\n- 1 + pℤ_p is a multiplicative subgroup of ℤ_p^×.\n\nThe problem then is to prove the isomorphism between ℤ_p^× and the product of these two groups, and further that this is isomorphic to ℤ/(p−1)ℤ × ℤ_p.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a prime number,\n- p > 2,\n- μ_{p−1} is the group of (p−1)-th roots of unity in ℤ_p,\n- 1 + pℤ_p is a multiplicative subgroup of ℤ_p^×.\n\nProblem: Prove that ℤ_p^× ≅ μ_{p−1} × (1 + pℤ_p) ≅ ℤ/(p−1)ℤ × ℤ_p.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is one line, one condition per object. The first two are clear: p is prime and p > 2. The third and fourth are about the definitions of the groups involved. The problem is to establish the isomorphism, so those groups are part of the problem's context.\n\nThe user also mentions confusion about why the units seem isomorphic to something \"bigger\" than ℤ_p. But in the formatted problem, we don't include the user's confusion, just the problem itself. So the final answer should capture the assumptions and the problem as per the structure.",
