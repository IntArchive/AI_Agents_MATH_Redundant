    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given math problem into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and filter out any unnecessary information.\n\nThe original problem is about a function f defined on the interval [a, b]. The conditions given are:\n1. f''(x) + f(x) > 0 for all x in (a, b).\n2. f(x) > 0 for all x in (a, b).\n3. f(a) = f(b) = 0.\n\nThe goal is to prove that b - a > π.\n\nHmm, the example provided in the instructions showed that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let me check if there's any implicit assumption here. The function is twice differentiable since f'' exists, so maybe that's an assumption. But the problem states f:[a,b] → R and mentions f''(x), so differentiability is given. The user probably wants each condition as separate assumptions.\n\nLet me parse the original question again:\n\n- \"f:[a,b] → R\" – the function is defined on [a,b].\n- \"f''(x) + f(x) > 0 for all x ∈ (a, b)\" – differential inequality.\n- \"f(x) > 0 for all x ∈ (a, b)\" – positivity in the open interval.\n- \"f(a) = f(b) = 0\" – boundary conditions.\n\nSo each of these should be separate assumptions. Wait, the example had two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the function's domain, the differential inequality, the positivity, and the boundary conditions are all separate. So the assumptions should list each of these conditions.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't explicitly state differentiability beyond f''. However, to have f''(x), the function must be twice differentiable on [a,b], right? But the problem states f:[a,b] → R and mentions f''(x), so the differentiability is part of the problem's setup. Therefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n1. f is a twice differentiable function from [a, b] to R.\n2. For all x in (a, b), f''(x) + f(x) > 0.\n3. For all x in (a, b), f(x) > 0.\n4. f(a) = 0.\n5. f(b) = 0.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"f: [a,b] → R satisfies: f''(x) + f(x) > 0 and f(x) > 0 for all x ∈ (a, b); f(a) = f(b) = 0.\" So in the problem statement, they mention the domain and codomain, the differential inequality, the positivity, and the boundary conditions. However, the fact that f is twice differentiable is implied because they refer to f''(x). So perhaps the first assumption is that f is twice differentiable on [a, b]. But the problem didn't explicitly state that; it's part of the problem's premise. So in the formatted problem, should that be an assumption?\n\nLooking back at the example given in the instructions: the original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91, with n being an integer. The user formatted the assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but in the original example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem's answer required that n is an integer, but the example's formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, but in the original example, the user structured it as:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe that example was incorrect, or perhaps the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are added. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example was miswritten. Alternatively, perhaps the example was for a different problem where the divisibility by 7 is part of the assumptions. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. But in the given example, the formatted problem's assumptions include n being an integer and n divisible by 7, even though the original problem states \"for every integer n\". That might be an error in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the instruction: list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\nSuppose f:[a,b] → R satisfies:\n\n- f''(x) + f(x) > 0 for all x in (a, b)\n- f(x) > 0 for all x in (a, b)\n- f(a) = f(b) = 0\n\nProve that b - a > π.\n\nSo, to structure this:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is a function from [a, b] to R.\n- f is twice differentiable on [a, b]. (Because f'' exists; but the original problem didn't state this explicitly, but mentions f''(x). So this is an implicit assumption. But in the problem statement, the user wrote \"Suppose f:[a,b] → R satisfies: f''(x) + f(x) > 0...\" so the existence of f'' is given. Hence, f is twice differentiable on [a,b] is an assumption.\n\nBut the original problem may not have explicitly stated that f is twice differentiable; it's part of the problem's setup. So perhaps we need to include that as an assumption. However, in the problem statement, when they mention f''(x), they are assuming that f is twice differentiable. So yes, that's an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f is a function from [a, b] to R.\n2. f is twice differentiable on [a, b].\n3. For all x in (a, b), f''(x) + f(x) > 0.\n4. For all x in (a, b), f(x) > 0.\n5. f(a) = 0.\n6. f(b) = 0.\n\nWait, but maybe \"f is a function from [a, b] to R\" and \"f is twice differentiable on [a, b]\" can be combined as \"f: [a, b] → R is twice differentiable.\" But according to the instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps they need to be separate? But the first is about the domain and codomain, the second about differentiability.\n\nBut the original problem states \"f: [a,b] → R\", so that's the first assumption. Then, the existence of f''(x) implies twice differentiable, which is the second assumption. Then the other conditions follow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the original problem, the differentiability is part of the problem's premise, so it's an assumption. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list all the conditions given in the problem, each as a separate line.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nAssumption 1: f is defined on the interval [a, b] and maps to R (i.e., f: [a, b] → R).\n\nAssumption 2: f is twice differentiable on [a, b].\n\nAssumption 3: For all x in (a, b), f''(x) + f(x) > 0.\n\nAssumption 4: For all x in (a, b), f(x) > 0.\n\nAssumption 5: f(a) = 0.\n\nAssumption 6: f(b) = 0.\n\nBut the original problem statement combines some of these. Let's check the exact wording:\n\n\"Suppose f:[a,b] → R satisfies: f''(x)+f(x)>0 and f(x)>0 for all x∈(a,b); f(a)=f(b)=0. Prove that b-a>π.\"\n\nSo the problem statement includes:\n\n- Domain and codomain: f:[a,b] → R.\n\n- Conditions:\n\n  1. f''(x) + f(x) > 0 for all x ∈ (a,b).\n\n  2. f(x) > 0 for all x ∈ (a,b).\n\n  3. f(a) = f(b) = 0.\n\nThe differentiability is implied by the mention of f''(x). So, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n1. f: [a, b] → R is twice differentiable.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"f:[a,b] → R satisfies: f''(x) + f(x) >0...\", so the existence of f''(x) is part of the problem's conditions, hence f must be twice differentiable. So, perhaps the first assumption is that f is a twice differentiable function from [a, b] to R.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be one line, one property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f: [a, b] → R is twice differentiable,\n\n- For all x in (a, b), f''(x) + f(x) > 0,\n\n- For all x in (a, b), f(x) > 0,\n\n- f(a) = 0,\n\n- f(b) = 0.\n\nBut \"f: [a, b] → R is twice differentiable\" combines two things: the domain/codomain and differentiability. However, according to the example, each assumption should address only one property. In the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", the second \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here, \"f is defined on [a, b] with codomain R\" and \"f is twice differentiable on [a, b]\" are two separate assumptions.\n\nBut the original problem statement starts with \"f: [a,b] → R\", so that's the first assumption. Then, since f''(x) is mentioned, the second assumption is that f is twice differentiable. Then the rest as separate lines.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem statement, \"f: [a,b] → R\" is given, and then the conditions include the differential inequality, the positivity, and the boundary conditions. So in terms of assumptions, we can structure as:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is a function from [a, b] to R,\n\n- f is twice differentiable on [a, b],\n\n- For all x in (a, b), f''(x) + f(x) > 0,\n\n- For all x in (a, b), f(x) > 0,\n\n- f(a) = 0,\n\n- f(b) = 0.\n\nThis way, each line is a single assumption about one property of f. However, the first two lines could be combined as \"f: [a, b] → R is twice differentiable,\" but according to the example's structure, each assumption should be a separate line. But in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. Therefore, here, \"f is a function from [a, b] to R\" and \"f is twice differentiable on [a, b]\" are two separate assumptions.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, \"f: [a,b] → R\" is part of the problem statement. So that's one assumption. Then, the differentiability is another because f'' exists. So yes, two separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these six assumptions? Wait, no, let me count:\n\n1. f is a function from [a, b] to R.\n\n2. f is twice differentiable on [a, b].\n\n3. For all x in (a, b), f''(x) + f(x) > 0.\n\n4. For all x in (a, b), f(x) > 0.\n\n5. f(a) = 0.\n\n6. f(b) = 0.\n\nBut in the example, the user combined some conditions. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions:\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. But maybe the example was from a different problem. Alternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user's instruction is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the assumptions should include all the given conditions in the problem statement, each as a separate line.\n\nThe problem says \"Suppose f:[a,b] → R satisfies: f''(x) + f(x) >0 and f(x) >0 for all x∈(a,b); f(a)=f(b)=0. Prove that b-a>π.\"\n\nSo breaking down:\n\n1. f: [a, b] → R. (Function's domain and codomain)\n\n2. f is twice differentiable on [a, b]. (Because f''(x) exists)\n\n3. For all x ∈ (a, b), f''(x) + f(x) > 0.\n\n4. For all x ∈ (a, b), f(x) > 0.\n\n5. f(a) = 0.\n\n6. f(b) = 0.\n\nTherefore, six assumptions. However, maybe the differentiability is part of the function's definition. For example, when they say \"f: [a,b] → R satisfies...\", the satisfaction of f''(x) implies that f is twice differentiable. So perhaps the differentiability is already included in the first assumption. But strictly speaking, the domain and codomain don't specify differentiability. So to be precise, we need to list the twice differentiability as a separate assumption.\n\nHence, the formatted assumptions should include all six points. However, in practice, when someone states a function satisfies a differential equation, they usually assume the necessary differentiability. But following the example's structure, which split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even if the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem included both. So maybe the user wants all explicit and implicit assumptions listed separately.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \n- f is a function from [a, b] to R,\n- f is twice differentiable on [a, b],\n- For all x in (a, b), f''(x) + f(x) > 0,\n- For all x in (a, b), f(x) > 0,\n- f(a) = 0,\n- f(b) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that b - a > π.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition of one object (f in this case).",
