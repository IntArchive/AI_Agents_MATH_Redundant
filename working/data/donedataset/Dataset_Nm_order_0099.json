    "Content": "How can I understand that $A^TA$ is invertible if $A$ has independent columns? I found a similar question , phrased the other way around, so I tried to use the theorem $$\nrank(A^TA) \\le min(rank(A^T),rank(A))\n$$ Given $rank(A) = rank(A^T) = n$ and $A^TA$ produces an $n\\times n$ matrix, I can't seem to prove that $rank(A^TA)$ is actually $n$. I also tried to look at the question another way with the matrices $$\nA^TA\n= \\begin{bmatrix}a_1^T \\\\ a_2^T \\\\ \\ldots \\\\ a_n^T \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}A^Ta_1 A^Ta^2 \\ldots A^Ta_n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ But I still can't seem to show that $A^TA$ is invertible. So, how should I get a better understanding of why $A^TA$ is invertible if $A$ has independent columns?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the following:\n$$A^TAx=\\mathbf 0$$\nHere, $Ax$, an element in the range of $A$, is in the null space of $A^T$. However, the null space of $A^T$ and the range of $A$ are orthogonal complements, so $Ax=\\mathbf 0$. If $A$ has linearly independent columns, then $Ax=\\mathbf 0 \\implies x=\\mathbf 0$, so the null space of $A^TA=\\{\\mathbf 0\\}$. Since $A^TA$ is  a square matrix, this means $A^TA$ is invertible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking why A^TA is invertible if A has independent columns. They mention trying to use the rank inequality, rank(A^TA) ≤ min(rank(A^T), rank(A)), and note that since rank(A) = rank(A^T) = n (assuming A has n independent columns), A^TA is an n×n matrix. But they can't figure out why the rank of A^TA is exactly n. They also tried looking at the matrix multiplication structure but still couldn't show invertibility.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key assumptions here. The main condition is that matrix A has independent columns. Since the columns are independent, the rank of A is equal to the number of columns, which is n. So A is an m×n matrix with rank n. Then, A^TA is an n×n matrix. The problem is to show that A^TA is invertible under this assumption.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n- A is a matrix with independent columns. (This implies rank(A) = n)\n- The rank of A is n. (But this might be redundant since independent columns already give rank n)\n- The product A^TA is an n×n matrix. (Since A is m×n, A^T is n×m, so A^TA is n×n)\n\nWait, but maybe the key assumption is just that A has linearly independent columns. The rest might follow from that. The problem is to prove that under this condition, A^TA is invertible.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list that A has independent columns. Then the problem is to prove that A^TA is invertible.\n\nThe example given earlier had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. In this case, the main assumption is that A has independent columns. However, sometimes people might also note that A is of size m×n with rank n, but maybe the user here is assuming that A is a real matrix? Wait, the invertibility of A^TA holds when A has real entries and full column rank. But the question doesn't specify real matrices, though typically in such contexts, it's real. Maybe that's an implicit assumption. However, the original question doesn't mention that. So perhaps the only explicit assumption is that A has independent columns.\n\nWait, but in linear algebra, if A has independent columns, then rank(A) = n (if there are n columns). So that's an assumption. Also, A^TA is invertible if and only if A has full column rank. So the key assumption is A has linearly independent columns (i.e., full column rank). So I think the main assumption here is that A has independent columns. Therefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a matrix with independent columns.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A^TA is invertible.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"if A has independent columns\", so the assumption is just that. The problem is to prove invertibility of A^TA under that assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list that assumption and state the problem as proving A^TA is invertible. The example given in the user's example had two assumptions (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). In this case, the user's problem has one main assumption: A has independent columns. So that's the only one needed.",
