    "Content": "Consider the simplex determined by the origin, and $n$ unit basis vectors. The volume of this simplex is $\\frac{1}{n!}$, but I am intuitively struggling to see why. I have seen proofs for this and am convinced, but I can't help but think there must be a slicker or more intuitive argument for why this is so than what I have already seen. Any help would be appreciated!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It's easier to see an alternate simplex has volume $1/n!$ : The set of all points $(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)$ with $0\\leq x_1\\leq x_2\\leq\\cdots\\leq x_n\\leq 1$ . That's because the volume measures the probability that a random sequence of $n$ real numbers is in sorted order, and (except with the probability zero case where some pair of values are equal) there are $n!$ ways to permute a set of $n$ values, and only one of them is sorted. That this is the same volume as the original simplex is a little harder to see - these two simplices are not congruent, so their equal volume requires a little linear algebra. There is a linear transformation between the two sending $0\\leq x_1\\leq x_2\\leq \\cdots\\leq x_n\\leq 1$ to $(x_1,x_2-x_1,\\dots,x_n-x_{n-1})$ . The determinant of this linear transformation is $1$ , so it preserves hyper-volumes. Another approach is to ask how many ways can $n$ natural numbers $a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$ be chosen so that $a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n \\leq m$ . Standard combinatorics says this is $\\binom{m+n}{n}$ . And we see that $\\frac{1}{m^n}\\binom{n+m}{n}$ is an approximation of the hypervolume you want as $m$ gets large, by dividing the space into \"hypercubes\" of side length $\\frac{1}{m}$ , and this value approaches the volume as $m\\to\\infty$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition line by line, applying to one object each. The problem then states the main question.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: the user is asking about the intuition behind the volume of a simplex being 1/n!. The simplex in question is determined by the origin and n unit basis vectors. The title and the question both mention this, so the key elements are the origin, n basis vectors, and the volume being 1/n!.\n\nNow, the task is to extract the assumptions. The problem states that the simplex is determined by the origin and n unit basis vectors. So the assumptions should include:\n\n1. The simplex is determined by the origin.\n2. The simplex is determined by n unit basis vectors.\n3. The volume of this simplex is 1/n! (though this is actually the conclusion; wait, no. Wait, the problem is asking why the volume is 1/n!, so the volume being 1/n! is not an assumption but the thing to prove. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem, which are the simplex's vertices: the origin and the n unit basis vectors. So the problem's given conditions are that the simplex is formed by those points. Therefore, the assumptions should list those conditions.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though in the original problem statement, the user just said \"for every integer n\". The formatted problem split into two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem's assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the example must have been a typo or mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. Hmm. Maybe the example was a bad one, but regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nThe current problem is about the simplex formed by the origin and n unit basis vectors. So the assumptions here should be:\n\n1. The simplex is determined by the origin.\n2. The simplex is determined by n unit basis vectors.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't state any other conditions, like the dimension. The simplex in n-dimensional space, since there are n basis vectors. So maybe another assumption is that the simplex is in n-dimensional space. But the original problem doesn't explicitly state that, but from the context, it's implied. So perhaps we need to list that as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not. The problem says \"the simplex determined by the origin, and n unit basis vectors\". So each unit basis vector is in n-dimensional space. So the simplex is in n-dimensional space. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. The simplex is in n-dimensional space.\n2. The simplex is determined by the origin.\n3. The simplex is determined by n unit basis vectors.\n\nBut I need to check each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each assumption is a separate line, each about one property.\n\nSo, the simplex is determined by the origin: that's one assumption. Then, it's determined by n unit basis vectors: that's another. But maybe the fact that these are unit vectors and basis vectors is another condition. Wait, \"unit basis vectors\" is a single term, so perhaps each of the n vectors is a unit basis vector. So the assumption is that the simplex is determined by n unit basis vectors. So maybe that's one assumption. But the problem is structured as \"the simplex determined by the origin, and n unit basis vectors\", so the vertices are the origin and each of the n basis vectors.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The simplex has the origin as one of its vertices.\n- The simplex has n unit basis vectors as its other vertices.\n\nBut perhaps each vertex is a separate assumption? But the format says each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. Hmm. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate condition on the same object. In this case, the simplex's vertices are the origin and the n basis vectors, so each of those could be separate assumptions. But since they are all part of defining the simplex, perhaps it's better to split them. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex includes the origin as a vertex.\n- The simplex includes each of the n standard basis vectors as vertices.\n\nBut maybe the problem is that the simplex is determined by these points, so the problem's setup is that the simplex is the convex hull of the origin and the n unit basis vectors. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The simplex is the convex hull of the origin and n unit basis vectors in n-dimensional space.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction had separate assumptions for each condition, even if they are on the same object. For instance, in the example, n being an integer and n being divisible by 7 are separate assumptions, even though both apply to n.\n\nSo translating that to this problem: the simplex is determined by the origin (assumption 1) and by the n unit basis vectors (assumption 2). Wait, but each of these is part of the definition of the simplex. So perhaps each is a separate assumption. Alternatively, the problem says \"determined by the origin and n unit basis vectors\", so maybe that's considered one condition, but according to the example, it's better to split them into separate assumptions if possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each vertex is an assumption. But the origin is one vertex, and then there are n other vertices, each a unit basis vector. However, the problem states \"n unit basis vectors\", which are the standard basis vectors in n-dimensional space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex is in n-dimensional space.\n- The vertices of the simplex include the origin.\n- The vertices of the simplex include each of the n standard basis vectors.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line. So each of these would be separate assumptions. But the original problem statement might not mention the dimension, so maybe that's inferred.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions \"n unit basis vectors\", which in standard terms are in n-dimensional space. So the simplex is in n-dimensional space. So maybe that's an assumption.\n\nBut does the original problem explicitly state that? The original question's title and content just mention \"the simplex determined by the origin, and n unit basis vectors\". So the user is considering a simplex formed by 0 and e_1, e_2, ..., e_n in R^n. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The simplex is in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\n- The simplex has the origin as a vertex.\n- The simplex has each of the n standard basis vectors as vertices.\n\nBut perhaps the problem didn't mention the space's dimension, so maybe that's not an assumption. Alternatively, the n unit basis vectors imply that the space is n-dimensional. So maybe the assumption is that the simplex is in n-dimensional space, but that's inferred. However, since the problem doesn't state it explicitly, maybe we shouldn't include it. But maybe we should, to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions \"unit basis vectors\", which in mathematics typically are in the space of dimension equal to the number of vectors if they are standard basis vectors. So for n vectors, they are in n-dimensional space. So the simplex is in n-dimensional space. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The simplex is in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\n2. The simplex is determined by the origin (0,0,...,0).\n3. The simplex is determined by the n standard basis vectors e_1, e_2, ..., e_n.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"the simplex determined by the origin, and n unit basis vectors\". So perhaps the way to split the assumptions is:\n\n- The simplex is determined by the origin.\n- The simplex is determined by n unit basis vectors.\n\nEach as separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, \"the simplex is determined by the origin and n unit basis vectors\" as a single assumption, but the example shows splitting into multiple. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and they split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is wrong. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the example might have an error, perhaps confusing two different problems. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, maybe I shouldn't rely too much on the example, but rather follow the user's instruction to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the simplex is determined by two sets of points: the origin and the n unit basis vectors. So each of these is part of the simplex's definition. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. The simplex includes the origin as a vertex.\n2. The simplex includes each of the n unit basis vectors as vertices.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each applied to the simplex.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex includes the origin as a vertex.\n- The simplex includes each of the n unit basis vectors as vertices.\n\nProblem: Prove that the volume of this simplex is $\\frac{1}{n!}$.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that the basis vectors are unit vectors is another assumption. But \"unit basis vectors\" is a single term; each basis vector is a unit vector, so that's part of their definition. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex is determined by the origin and n unit basis vectors in n-dimensional space.\n\nBut that's combining multiple conditions into one line, which the example didn't do. The example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate lines. So following that, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex includes the origin as a vertex.\n- The simplex includes n basis vectors as vertices.\n- Each basis vector is a unit vector.\n\nBut the problem says \"unit basis vectors\", which are basis vectors that are unit vectors. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex includes the origin as a vertex.\n- The simplex includes n basis vectors as vertices.\n- Each basis vector is a unit vector.\n\nBut maybe the term \"unit basis vectors\" is a single condition. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex is determined by the origin and n unit basis vectors.\n\nBut this is one line. However, according to the example, it's better to split into separate assumptions. But in the example, it was incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions:\n- n is an integer.\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumptions added an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. So perhaps the example is not a good guide. Therefore, I should just follow the instruction: list all assumptions of the problem, each as a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the simplex is determined by the origin and n unit basis vectors. The assumptions here are:\n\n1. The simplex has the origin as a vertex.\n2. The simplex has n vertices, each being a unit basis vector in n-dimensional space.\n\nBut \"unit basis vector\" implies they are part of a basis, so in n-dimensional space. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\n1. The simplex is in n-dimensional space.\n2. The simplex has the origin as a vertex.\n3. The simplex has each of the n standard basis vectors as vertices.\n\nThat seems more precise. Because standard basis vectors in n-dimensional space are (1,0,...,0), (0,1,...,0), etc. Each is a unit vector.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex is in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\n- The simplex includes the origin as a vertex.\n- The simplex includes each of the n standard basis vectors as vertices.\n\nEach of these is a separate line, each addressing one property. The problem is to prove the volume is 1/n!.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't explicitly mention the space's dimension, so including that as an assumption might be adding information not present. The original question says \"the simplex determined by the origin, and n unit basis vectors\". The term \"unit basis vectors\" typically implies that they are orthonormal and part of a basis for the space, which would require the space to be n-dimensional if there are n vectors. So perhaps the dimension is inferred.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex is determined by the origin.\n- The simplex is determined by n unit basis vectors.\n\nEach of these is one line. Then the problem is to prove the volume is 1/n!.\n\nBut perhaps \"unit basis vectors\" is a single condition. However, in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are two separate conditions on n. Similarly, here, maybe \"determined by the origin\" and \"determined by n unit basis vectors\" are two separate conditions on the simplex.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex is determined by the origin.\n- The simplex is determined by n unit basis vectors.\nProblem: Prove that the volume of this simplex is $\\frac{1}{n!}$.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's original wording says \"the simplex determined by the origin, and n unit basis vectors\", so maybe that's a single assumption. But the example suggests splitting into multiple assumptions. Given that, perhaps splitting into:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex is determined by the origin.\n- The simplex is determined by n unit basis vectors.\n\nProblem: Prove that the volume of this simplex is $\\frac{1}{n!}$.\n\nThis seems consistent with the example provided, even if the example had an error. The key is to follow the structure: list each assumption on separate lines, each addressing one property or condition on one object.\n\nAnother angle: in the problem, the simplex is formed by the origin and the n unit basis vectors. So each of these points is a vertex of the simplex. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The simplex has the origin as a vertex.\n- The simplex has each of the n unit basis vectors as vertices.\n\nBut since there are n basis vectors, this would be n+1 vertices. So each vertex is a separate condition? No, the problem states that the simplex is determined by all these points together, so the two conditions are \"includes the origin\" and \"includes the n unit basis vectors\". Hence, two assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider the entire set of points (origin and basis vectors) as a single assumption, but according to the example, it's better to split them.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have two assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex includes the origin as a vertex.\n- The simplex includes each of the n unit basis vectors as vertices.\nProblem: Prove that the volume of this simplex is $\\frac{1}{n!}$.\n\nAlternatively, if \"n unit basis vectors\" is considered a single condition, then one assumption. But given the example's approach, splitting into multiple is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex is the convex hull of the origin and n unit basis vectors in n-dimensional space.\n\nBut that's combining multiple conditions into one line. The example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", so similar logic here: split into separate conditions.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The simplex is determined by the origin.\n- The simplex is determined by n unit basis vectors.\nProblem: Prove that the volume of this simplex is $\\frac{1}{n!}$.\n\nBut to be more precise, since the simplex is determined by all those points together, maybe it's one assumption. However, following the example's structure where multiple conditions are split, even if they are on the same object, I think splitting is the way to go here.",
