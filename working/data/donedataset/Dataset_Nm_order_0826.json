    "Content": "Let $A\\in GL_2\\left(\\mathbb{Z}\\right)$, the group of invertible matrices with integer coefficients, and denote by $\\omega(A)$ the order of $A$. How we prove that\n$$\\left\\{\\omega(A);A\\in GL_2\\left(\\mathbb{Z}\\right)\\right\\}=\\{1,2,3,4,6,\\infty\\}.$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's assume that $A\\in GL_2\\left(\\mathbb{Z}\\right)$ has finite order, let say $n$. Then $A^n=I$. Now look at this matrix as a matrix in $M_2(\\mathbb Q)$: we have $\\det A=\\pm 1$ and if consider its minimal polynomial $m_A\\in\\mathbb Q[X]$ this must divide $X^n-1$ and $\\deg m_A\\le 2$. If $\\deg m_A=1$, then $m_A=X-1$, that is, $A=I$ and $n=1$ or $m_A=X-1$, that is, $A=-I$ and $n=2$. (The only rational roots of unity are $\\pm1$.) If $\\deg m_A=2$, then $m_A(X)=(X-\\epsilon_1)(X-\\epsilon_2)$, $\\epsilon_1\\neq\\epsilon_2$, where $\\epsilon_i$ is an $n$th root of unity. Since $m_A\\in\\mathbb Q[X]$ we have $\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2\\in\\mathbb Q$ and $\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2\\in\\mathbb Q$. In fact, $m_A(X)=X^2-\\operatorname{tr}(A)X\\pm1$, and thus we get $\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2\\in\\mathbb Z$ and $\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2=\\pm1$. If $\\epsilon_1=1$, then $\\epsilon_2=-1$, $m_A=X^2-1$ and therefore $A^2=I$, so $n=2$. Now suppose that $\\epsilon_i\\neq 1$. Some easy remarks show that the only case to consider is $\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2=1$, that is, $\\epsilon_2=\\overline{\\epsilon}_1$. Then $m_A(X)=X^2-2\\cos\\frac{2k\\pi}{n}X+1$, with $n\\ge 2$ and $1\\le k<n$. But $2\\cos\\frac{2k\\pi}{n}\\in\\mathbb Z$ implies $2\\cos\\frac{2k\\pi}{n}=0,\\pm1,\\pm2$ so we have five possible minimal polynomials: $X^2+1$, $X^2\\pm X+1$ and $X^2\\pm2X+1$. (In fact only three, since the last two can't appear.) These give: $A^2+I=0$, so $n=4$; $A^2+A+I=0$, so $n=3$ and $A^2-A+I=0$, so $n=6$. I leave the OP the pleasure to find for each $n\\in\\{1,2,3,4,6,\\infty\\}$ a matrix $A\\in GL_2\\left(\\mathbb{Z}\\right)$ of order $n.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Order of matrices in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$\". The question says: Let $A$ be in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, which is the group of invertible 2x2 matrices with integer coefficients. Then $\\omega(A)$ is the order of $A$. We need to prove that the set of all such orders is {1,2,3,4,6,∞}. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The user mentioned that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem.\n\nAssumption 1: $A$ is an element of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. This means that $A$ is a 2x2 matrix with integer entries and that it's invertible. Since invertible here means that the determinant is ±1 (because the inverse must also have integer entries), maybe that's another assumption. Wait, but in the problem statement, $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is defined as the group of invertible matrices with integer coefficients. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- $A$ is a 2×2 matrix.\n- The entries of $A$ are integers.\n- $A$ is invertible (i.e., determinant is ±1).\n\nBut according to the example given, each assumption should be a single line. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. $A$ is a 2×2 matrix.\n2. The entries of $A$ are integers.\n3. The determinant of $A$ is ±1 (since $A$ is in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$).\n4. $\\omega(A)$ denotes the order of $A$ in the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nWait, but the problem is about proving the possible orders. The problem statement doesn't add more conditions on $A$ except being in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. So maybe the assumptions are just:\n\n- $A$ is an element of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ (which encapsulates being 2x2, integer entries, invertible with determinant ±1).\n\nBut the example given in the problem splits the assumptions into separate lines. For instance, in the example, they had \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But here, the key properties are that $A$ is in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, which inherently requires it to be a 2x2 integer matrix with determinant ±1. However, the user's example splits even the inherent properties. Wait, the original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here, we need to break down the components of $A$ being in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nSo, for the assumptions:\n\n1. $A$ is a 2×2 matrix.\n2. All entries of $A$ are integers.\n3. The determinant of $A$ is ±1.\n4. $\\omega(A)$ is the order of $A$ in the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nBut maybe \"A is in GL_2(ℤ)\" is a single assumption? But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property. So maybe split it into the matrix being 2x2, integer entries, invertible (det ±1). Then the problem is to determine the possible orders.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- $A$ is a 2×2 matrix.\n- All entries of $A$ are integers.\n- The determinant of $A$ is either 1 or -1.\n- $\\omega(A)$ is the order of $A$ in the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement defines $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ as the group of invertible matrices with integer coefficients, so perhaps the determinant is ±1 is part of the group's definition. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. $A$ is an element of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ (so 2×2, integer entries, determinant ±1).\nBut the user's example broke down even inherent properties. For instance, in the original example, the problem was about $n$ being an integer and divisible by 7. The user split into two assumptions. Similarly, here, maybe we should split into:\n\n1. $A$ is a 2×2 matrix.\n2. All entries of $A$ are integers.\n3. The determinant of $A$ is ±1.\n4. $\\omega(A)$ is the order of $A$ in the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nBut the problem is to find the set of possible orders, so these are all the assumptions. The problem is to show that this set is exactly {1,2,3,4,6,∞}. So the problem statement is as given.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$A$ is a 2×2 matrix,\nAll entries of $A$ are integers,\nThe determinant of $A$ is ±1,\n$\\omega(A)$ is the order of $A$ in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\left\\{\\omega(A);A\\in GL_2\\left(\\mathbb{Z}\\right)\\right\\}=\\{1,2,3,4,6,\\infty\\}.$$\n\nWait, but the user example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So perhaps each inherent property should be listed. So since being in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ requires being 2x2, integer entries, invertible (det ±1), so each of these is an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$A$ is a 2×2 matrix,\nAll entries of $A$ are integers,\nThe determinant of $A$ is ±1,\n$\\omega(A)$ is the order of $A$ in the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nProblem:\nProve that the set $\\{\\omega(A) \\mid A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})\\}$ is equal to $\\{1,2,3,4,6,\\infty\\}$.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each line is a separate condition. The problem is to prove the possible orders. So the answer should structure it this way.",
