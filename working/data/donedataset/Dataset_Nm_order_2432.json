    "Content": "I am trying to solve the following problem. Assume that we are given 26 distinct positive integers.\nShow that either there exist 6 of them $x_1<x_2<x_3<x_4<x_5<x_6$ , with $x_1$ dividing $x_2$ , $x_2$ dividing $x_3$ , $x_3$ dividing $x_4$ , $x_4$ dividing $x_5$ and $x_5$ dividing $x_6$ or there exist six of them, such that none of them divides another one of these six. A possibly good start is to assume that, in every six of these numbers, there exists at least one dividing another one of the same six. Update. I have found a solution of the problem (for 17 numbers though) in a Russian site. As unbelievable as it may sound, this problem was a question in a 1983 Soviet Mathematics contest (Турниры Городов) for student of 7-8 grades! I am presenting the solution I found in that site below as an answer, \nand it is generalised for $n^2+1$ distinct integers, where we show that either there exist $n+1$ of them dividing each other or none diving none else.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I have found this solution (for 17 numbers though) in a Russian site , as this problem was a question in a 1983 Soviet Mathematics contest ( Турниры Городов ) for student of 7-8 classes! Solution. We shall attach on each of our numbers $$\nx_1<x_2<\\cdots<x_{26},\n$$ an index next to their subscript in the following fashion: $x_1$ becomes $x_{1,1}$ . If $x_1$ divides $x_2$ , then $x_2$ becomes $x_{2,2}$ , otherwise it becomes $x_{2,1}$ . In general, if we have attached indices to $x_1,\\ldots,x_k$ , then the index of $x_{k+1}$ will be $1$ is none of the $x_1,\\ldots,x_k$ divides $x_{k+1}$ , or it will become $i+1$ , if $i$ is the largest index of all the numbers which divide $x_{k+1}$ . If the index of some of the $x_j$ 's is at least $6$ then we have have a sequence $$\nx_{k_1,1} \\mid x_{k_2,2} \\mid x_{k_3,3} \\mid x_{k_4,4}\n\\mid x_{k_5,5}\\mid x_{k_6,6}.\n$$ If all the indices are less or equal to $5$ , then some number in $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ , say $j$ , is necessarily the index of at least $6$ numbers, i.e. $$\nx_{k_1,j} < x_{k_2,j} < x_{k_3,j} < x_{k_4,j} < x_{k_5,j} < x_{k_6,j},\n$$ which means that none of the above $6$ numbers divide another one of them. Note. Τhis can be generalised to finding a chain of $k$ numbers, fully ordered by division, or a subset of $\\ell$ numbers, with none of them dividing another one, among $m$ distinct positive integers, whenever $(k-1)(\\ell-1)\\le m-1$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example they provided shows how to break down the problem into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The problem states: We have 26 distinct positive integers. We need to show that either there's a chain of 6 numbers where each divides the next, or there's a set of 6 numbers where none divides any other. The user mentioned an example where they broke down assumptions, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the key points are:\n\n1. 26 distinct positive integers are given.\n2. We need to show either a chain of 6 numbers with each dividing the next (x1 | x2 | x3 | x4 | x5 | x6) or a set of 6 numbers where none divides another.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The numbers are distinct. (Each number is unique.)\n- All numbers are positive integers. (Each number is positive.)\n- There are exactly 26 numbers. (The count is 26.)\n\nThe problem statement is to show the either/or condition regarding divisibility chains or independent sets.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Each assumption is a single property for one object. Here, the problem's assumptions are about the 26 numbers: they are distinct, positive, and there are 26 of them. Each of these is a separate condition, so they should each be their own bullet point under Assumption.\n\nThe problem part is the either/or statement. So the formatted problem would list those three assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem doesn't mention any restrictions beyond the 26 numbers being distinct and positive. The original problem also mentions \"either there exist 6 of them...\" which is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The update talks about a solution for 17 numbers, but that's probably extra info not needed in the formatted problem.\n\nSo the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The numbers are distinct.\n- The numbers are positive integers.\n- There are 26 numbers.\n\nProblem:\nShow that either there exist 6 numbers forming a chain where each divides the next, or there exist 6 numbers where none divides another.\n\nThat seems to fit the required format. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property. The problem is stated concisely.",
