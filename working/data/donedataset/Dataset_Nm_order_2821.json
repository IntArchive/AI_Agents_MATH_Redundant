    "Content": "The phrase \"neon number\" is sometimes used for a number where: square the number, add the digits of that in base 10, and you get the original number. So, 9 is a neon number (-> 81, 8+1, 9) Indeed it is usually said there are only three neon numbers (0, 1, and 9). Surprisingly I couldn't google any proof of this. (All the numbers up to a few billion have been trivially tested.) Is there a proof? And angularly, are \"neon numbers\" of any value or interest at all, or is it just a quirky thing?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose a number $m$ has $n$ digits. Then $m^2$ has atmost $2n$ digits. The sum of digits of $m^2$ is at most $9\\times 2n=18n$ . If the sum of digits of $m^2$ is equal to $m$ then $10^{n-1}\\le m\\le18n$ . This only true if $n<3$ , so only single digit and double digit numbers can possibly be neon numbers. You can prove using modular arithmetic that only numbers of the form $9k$ and $9k+1$ can be neon numbers. This reduces the number of positive integers that we have to check. EDIT Like @JBentley pointed out in the comments $0$ has to be considered separately because the inequality $10^{n-1}\\le m$ does not hold.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem about neon numbers. First, I need to understand what a neon number is. From the question, it's defined as a number where if you square it and sum the digits of the square (in base 10), you get the original number. The user mentions that it's usually said there are only three: 0, 1, and 9. They want a proof of this and also some context on whether these numbers have any significance.\n\nStarting with the assumptions. The problem is about proving there are only three neon numbers. The key here is to list all the conditions each number must satisfy. The main property is that the sum of the digits of the square of the number equals the number itself. Since the user is asking for a proof, I need to structure the problem properly.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem format included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this case, the problem is about neon numbers, which are numbers satisfying a certain condition. The assumptions here would be the properties that define a neon number. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo, the neon number definition: Let’s break it down. Let’s say a number x is a neon number if when you square x, then sum the digits of x² in base 10, the result is x. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a non-negative integer. (Since we’re talking about digits in base 10, negative numbers might complicate things, but maybe the problem assumes non-negative.)\n- x² is computed and expressed in base 10.\n- The sum of the digits of x² equals x.\n\nBut the user mentions that testing up to a few billion shows only 0, 1, 9. So maybe the problem is implicitly assuming x is a non-negative integer, and the task is to prove that only 0, 1, and 9 satisfy the condition. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a non-negative integer,\nThe sum of the digits of x² in base 10 equals x.\n\nProblem: Prove that the only neon numbers are 0, 1, and 9.\n\nWait, the user's original question says \"the problem\" is to prove that there are only three neon numbers. The example in the format had specific conditions, but here the condition is the definition of a neon number. So the assumptions are the definition. Each part of the definition should be a separate line. Let me check:\n\nThe definition: A neon number is a number x such that the sum of the digits of x² equals x. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a non-negative integer,\n- The sum of the digits of x² (in base 10) is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that the only numbers x satisfying these assumptions are 0, 1, and 9.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The first line is that x is a non-negative integer. The second line is about the sum of digits of x² equals x.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a non-negative integer,\nThe sum of the digits of x² in base 10 equals x.\n\nProblem: Prove that the only neon numbers are 0, 1, and 9.\n\nYes, that seems right. The user's example included an assumption about divisibility, but here the assumptions are the definition of the neon number. The problem is to show only three numbers meet those conditions.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned \"angularly, are 'neon numbers' of any value or interest...\" but the answer format only includes the problem part, not the additional discussion. So in the formatted problem, we just need the assumptions and the problem statement. The rest about their interest is an aside, so we filter that out.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as above.",
