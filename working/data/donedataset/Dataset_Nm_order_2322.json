    "Content": "Show the set of points $X = \\{(t^3, t^4, t^5) \\}$ with $t\\in k$ is closed in $\\mathbb A^{3}$ and find three generators of $\\mathcal{I}(X)$. This is a homework question, so please don't provide full answers. I've just started algebraic geometry and am not familiar with techniques to use at all. I have that the canonical map $k[x,y,z] \\rightarrow k[t^3, t^4, t^5]$ has kernel $\\mathcal{I}(X)$. Since it's surjective then $k[x,y,z]/ \\mathcal{I}(X) \\simeq k[t^3, t^4, t^5]$. But $k[t^3, t^4, t^5]$ is an integral domain so $\\mathcal{I}(X)$ must be prime. Then $X$ is irreducible (by the correspondence $\\mathcal{I}(-)$ between prime ideals and irreducible subsets). But I have no idea how to find the generators. Looking around it seems that the generators are $xz-y^2, yz-x^3, z^2-x^2y$, but I don't know how these are deduced or to prove that it is indeed $\\mathcal{I}(X)$ that they span (of course it is contained in $\\mathcal{I}(X)$). Any help, please? Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Edit: As pointed out in the comments, my original answer was incorrect. I have now updated it to something that I believe works. What we want to do is find some ideal $I$ such that $Z(I) = X$, to show that it is closed. Something that is helpful to notice is that if $(x,y,z)\\in X$ isn't $0$, then $\\frac{z}{y}=t=\\frac{y}{x}$. So any element of $X$ satisfies the equations $ZX=Y^2$ and $ZX^5=Y^5$ i.e. lies in the affine variety generated by the two polynomials $ZX-Y^2$ and $ZX^5-Y^5$. To show that this variety is exactly $X$, you need to show that for a given point satisfying both of the given equations, you can find some $t$ such that the point is of the form $(t^3,t^4,t^5)$ (hint, look at how we derived the two equations from $t$ and try and reverse the procedure.) In general, showing that $I(X)$ is generated by a given set of generators is hard, but provided you have a small number of generators where some variables occur to low degrees, there is a method that will sometimes work, it is essentially a glorified division algorithm: We try to show that $I(X)=\\langle Z^2-X^2Y, Y^2-XZ, X^3-YZ\\rangle$*. Clearly each of the three given elements lies in $I(X)$, so we just need to show that any element of $I(X)$ is lies in the right hand ideal. First suppose $f(X,Y,Z)$ is in $I(X)$. Then we can look at the monomials occurring in $f$, and look in particular at how many times $Z$ appears in each monomial. In each monomial, $Z$ might not appear at all, $Z$ might appear once, or $Z$ might appear two or more times. This means that we can split $f$ up into simpler polynomials: $$f(X,Y,Z)=Z^2f_2(X,Y,Z)+Zf_1(X,Y)+f_0(X,Y)$$ where $f_0$ is the sum of monomials in $f$ where $Z$ doesn't appear, $Zf_1$ is the sum of monomials in $f$ where $Z$ appears once, and $Z^2f_2$ is the sum of monomials in $f$ where $Z$ appears at least twice. You can also think of this as applying the division algorithm to $f$ when you consider $f$ as a polynomial in $Z$ with coefficients in $k[X,Y]$, and you are dividing $f$ by $Z^2$ to get remainder $Zf_1(X,Y)+f_2(X,Y)$. Now we can re-write the above equation as follows: $$f(X,Y,Z)=(Z^2-X^2Y)f_2(X,Y,Z)+X^2Yf_2(X,Y)+Zf_1(X,Y)+f_0(X,Y).$$ But since $I(X)$ is an ideal and $f(X,Y,Z), (Z^2-X^2Y) \\in I(X)$, this means that: $$f(X,Y,Z) - (Z^2-X^2Y)f_2(X,Y) = Zf_1(X,Y)+f_3(X,Y) \\in I(X)$$ where $f_3(X,Y) = X^2Yf_2(X,Y) +f_0(X,Y)$, a polynomial only involving powers of $X$ and $Y$. Now we can repeat the process with $f_1(X,Y)$ and $f_3(X,Y)$, but instead of looking at how many times $Z$ appears in the monomial of each of these, we now look at how many times $Y$ appears. Then we can write $f_1(X,Y)$ as a sum of three polynomials in just the single variable $X$, with one of them multiplied by $Y$ and one of the multiplied by $Y^2$. We can then do a similar thing for $f_3$. Using these expressions for $f_1$ and $f_3$, and a similar argument to what we used to show $Zf_1(X,Y)+f_3(X,Y) \\in I(X)$, we can show that some polynomial of the form: $$XZ^2g_1(X)+ZYg_2(X)+Zg_3(X)+XZg_4(X)+Yg_5(X)+g_6(X)$$ lies in $I(X)$. But by writing $XZ^2g_1 = (Z^2-X^2Y)Xg_1 + X^3Yg_1$ and by realizing that e.g. $Xg_4(X)$ is still a polynomial in $X$, we can deduce that a polynomial of the form: $$h(X,Y,Z) = YZh_1(X) + Zh_2(X)+Yh_3(X)+h_4(X)$$ lies in $I(X)$. The natural continuation would be to repeat the process with each of the $h_i(X)$ and the third generator $X^3-YZ$, and then multiply out and deduce that some polynomial $f'(X,Y,Z)$ which is a sum of monomials obtained by multiplying one element of the set $\\{YZ,Z,Y,1\\}$ with one element of the set $\\{YZ,X^2,X,1 \\}$ lies in $I(X)$. But this would mean that $f'$ vanishes on $X$, and so for all $t$, $f'(t^3,t^4,t^5) = 0$. Assuming we have an infinite (and in particular algebraically closed) field, this then implies that the polynomial in $t$, $f'(t^3,t^4,t^5)$ is then the zero polynomial. But then you can check by hand that all of the monomials that appear in $f'$ give different powers of $t$ when we substitute $X = t^3, Y = t^4, Z = t^5$, so that $f'$ must have been the zero polynomial also. Thinking about what we have done here, you should be able to see that $f'$ is in some sense a remainder of $f$ when divided by the three generators. Explicitly, what we did was write $$f(X,Y,Z) = (Z^2-X^2Y)\\bar{f_1}(X,Y,Z)+(Y^2-XZ)\\bar{f_2}(X,Y,Z)+(X^3-YZ)\\bar{f_3}(X,Y,Z)+f'(X,Y,Z)$$ and then deduced that $f'(X,Y,Z) = 0$. In other words we have shown that any element of $I(X)$ lies within $(Z^2-X^2Y,Y^2-XZ,X^3-YZ)$, so this ideal is all of $I(X)$. Remark: To make things a bit simpler computationally, we could have substituted powers of $t$ for $X,Y$ & $Z$ into our expression for $h$, and looked at the possible powers of $t$ appearing in each of the four simpler polynomials in our expression of $h$ modulo $3$. Since $Zh_2(X)$ is the only part contributing terms of order equal to $2\\pmod 3$ and $Yh_3(X)$ is the only part contributing terms of order equal to $1\\pmod 3$, we must have that $Zh_2(X)=0=Yh_3(X)$. We may now decompose $h_1(X)$ and $h_3(X)$ as before, but our remainder $f'$ now consists of fewer monomials, so it is easier to check that $f'$ is $0$. *The real question is, why did we choose these generators? If you use the method described it should be reasonably clear why we want something similar to the given ones. What we look for in possible choices of generators are elements of $I(X)$ which have a small number of terms (here each generator has two terms, but if one term were possible that would be better) and where one of the terms is  a power of $X,Y$ or $Z$, and preferably as low a power as possible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the set X = {(t³, t⁴, t⁵)} in 𝔸³ is closed and find three generators for its ideal ℐ(X). They mentioned using the canonical map k[x,y,z] → k[t³,t⁴,t⁵], which has kernel ℐ(X). Since the map is surjective, the quotient k[x,y,z]/ℐ(X) is isomorphic to k[t³,t⁴,t⁵], which is an integral domain, so ℐ(X) is prime, implying X is irreducible.\n\nFirst, to show X is closed in 𝔸³, we need to demonstrate that X is the zero set of some ideal, i.e., X = V(I) for some ideal I. Since X is parametrized by (t³, t⁴, t⁵), we need to find polynomials in k[x,y,z] that vanish on all such points. The user already knows the generators might be xz - y², yz - x³, z² - x²y. But how do we arrive at these?\n\nStarting with the parametrization x = t³, y = t⁴, z = t⁵. Let's look for relations among x, y, z. For example:\n\n1. x³ = (t³)³ = t⁹, and y z = t⁴ * t⁵ = t⁹. So x³ = y z ⇒ y z - x³ = 0. That gives the polynomial yz - x³.\n\n2. Similarly, x z = t³ * t⁵ = t⁸, and y² = (t⁴)² = t⁸. So x z - y² = 0 ⇒ xz - y².\n\n3. z² = (t⁵)² = t¹⁰, and x² y = (t³)² * t⁴ = t¹⁰. So z² - x² y = 0 ⇒ z² - x² y.\n\nThese three polynomials vanish on X. Now, to show that these generate the entire ideal ℐ(X), we need to verify that any polynomial vanishing on X can be expressed as a combination of these generators. Since the user is a beginner, maybe using the fact that the coordinate ring k[X] is isomorphic to k[t³,t⁴,t⁵], which has a monomial basis. Then, using the map k[x,y,z] → k[t³,t⁴,t⁵], the kernel is precisely ℐ(X). The relations we found generate the kernel, so they should suffice. But how to formalize this? Maybe using Gröbner bases or showing that any relation can be reduced using these generators. Alternatively, since the three generators form a prime ideal of height 2 (by the principal ideal theorem?), and the dimension of X is 1, so the ideal has height 2 in k[x,y,z], which is 3-dimensional. Thus, a prime ideal of height 2 generated by three elements would require checking they form a regular sequence or using some other criterion. But this might be advanced. Alternatively, since the parametrization is injective (if k is algebraically closed and t is in k), then the ideal is generated by those three polynomials. The user can check that these polynomials vanish on X, and that any polynomial vanishing on X is in the ideal generated by them. To prove they generate the entire ideal, one might use elimination theory or the fact that the coordinate ring is isomorphic to k[t³,t⁴,t⁵], which has Krull dimension 1, so the ideal must be of height 2, and the three generators form a prime ideal of height 2. Therefore, they must generate ℐ(X). \n\nBut perhaps more simply, since the user knows the generators, they can show inclusion both ways: the ideal generated by those three is contained in ℐ(X), and conversely, any element of ℐ(X) is in the ideal. This might involve taking a polynomial f(x,y,z) that vanishes on X and expressing it as a combination of the generators. Using the parametrization, substitute x = t³, y = t⁴, z = t⁵ into f, set it to zero, and show that this implies f can be written using the relations. Alternatively, use the fact that the coordinate ring is generated by t³, t⁴, t⁵, so any relation among x, y, z must come from the syzygies of these monomials. The generators provided are the basic syzygies, and higher ones can be expressed via these. \n\nAs for showing X is closed, since we have generators for ℐ(X), then X is the zero set of these polynomials, hence closed in the Zariski topology. So the problem reduces to showing that these three polynomials generate the ideal, which would confirm X is closed as it's the vanishing set of that ideal.\n\nBut the user is just starting, so maybe they need to check that V(I) = X, where I is generated by those three polynomials. Show that any point in V(I) has coordinates (a³, a⁴, a⁵) for some a in k. Suppose (x,y,z) is in V(I). Then xz - y² = 0, yz - x³ = 0, z² - x² y = 0. Let’s try to solve these equations. Suppose x ≠ 0. Then from xz = y² ⇒ z = y²/x. Substitute into yz = x³: y*(y²/x) = x³ ⇒ y³/x = x³ ⇒ y³ = x⁴ ⇒ y = x^{4/3}. Similarly, substituting z = y²/x into z² = x² y: (y²/x)² = x² y ⇒ y⁴/x² = x² y ⇒ y⁴ = x⁴ y ⇒ y⁴ - x⁴ y = 0 ⇒ y(y³ - x⁴) = 0. If y ≠ 0, then y³ = x⁴. So x must be a cube, y a fourth power, and z a fifth power. Let’s set x = a³, then y³ = (a³)^4 = a¹² ⇒ y = a⁴. Then z = y²/x = (a⁴)^2 / a³ = a^8 / a³ = a⁵. So (x,y,z) = (a³, a⁴, a⁵). If x = 0, then from xz = y² ⇒ 0*z = y² ⇒ y = 0. Then from yz = x³ ⇒ 0*z = 0, and z² = x² y ⇒ z² = 0 ⇒ z = 0. So the only point with x=0 is (0,0,0), which is also (0³, 0⁴, 0⁵). Thus, V(I) = X, so X is closed. Therefore, the three generators suffice. \n\nThis process shows that X is closed and the three polynomials generate ℐ(X). The key steps are verifying that the given polynomials vanish on X and that any solution to those polynomials must lie in X. For a beginner, focusing on substitution and solving the equations step by step would help understand why those generators work.",
