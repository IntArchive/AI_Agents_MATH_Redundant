    "Content": "Consider the following positive integers:\n$$a,a+d,a+2d,\\dots$$\nSuppose there is a perfect square in the above list of numbers. Then prove that there are infinitely many perfect square in the above list. How can I do this? At first I started in this way:\nLet the $n$th term is perfect square. Therefore,\n$$t_n=a+(n-1)d=m^2.$$\nThen I think that I will put values at the position of $n$. But I failed to find anything from this level. Can somebody help me?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that $$(m+d)^2=m^2+(2m+d)\\cdot d$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the original question. The problem is about an arithmetic progression of positive integers: a, a+d, a+2d, and so on. The key points here are:\n\n1. The sequence is an arithmetic progression. That means each term increases by a common difference d.\n2. The terms are positive integers. So, both a and d must be positive integers to ensure all terms are positive.\n3. There is at least one perfect square in the sequence. The problem states that if there's one square, there are infinitely many.\n4. The goal is to prove the existence of infinitely many perfect squares in this arithmetic progression.\n\nNow, breaking down the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n- The first term of the arithmetic progression is a positive integer. So, \"a is a positive integer.\"\n- The common difference d is also a positive integer because the sequence consists of positive integers. So, \"d is a positive integer.\"\n- The sequence is an arithmetic progression. That's a key structure, so \"The sequence is an arithmetic progression with initial term a and common difference d.\"\n- There exists at least one perfect square in the sequence. The original problem mentions \"there is a perfect square in the above list,\" so \"There exists at least one term in the sequence that is a perfect square.\"\n\nPutting these together, each assumption is a separate line. Now, the problem statement is to prove that there are infinitely many perfect squares in the arithmetic progression given that there's at least one. So, the problem part is straightforward as stated.\n\nI should check if I missed any assumptions. The user's example included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the conditions are more about the structure of the sequence and the existence of one square. I think that's all. Maybe the user initially thought about setting a particular term as a square (like tn = m²), but the problem as stated doesn't require specific values for a and d beyond them being positive integers. So the key assumptions are the ones listed.",
