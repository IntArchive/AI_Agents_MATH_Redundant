    "Content": "I am trying to prove that: The matrix $C = \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}A& 0\\\\0 & B\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)$ is diagonalizable, if only if $A$ and $B$ are diagonalizable. If $A\\in GL(\\mathbb{C}^n)$ and $B\\in GL(\\mathbb{C}^m)$ are diagonalizable, then is easy to check the $C\\in GL(\\mathbb{C}^{n+m})$ is diagonalizable. But if I suppose that $C$ is diagonalizable, then exists $S = [S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{n+m}]$ , $S_i\\in\\mathbb{C}^{m+n}$ , such that $S^{-1}CS = \\mbox{diag}(\\lambda_i)$ . Now $CS_i = \\lambda_iS_i$ , and  if $S_i = \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}x_i\\\\y_i\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)$ , $x_i\\in\\mathbb{C}^n$ and $y_i\\in\\mathbb{C}^m$ , then $$Ax_i = \\lambda_ix_i\\quad\\mbox{ and }\\quad By_i = \\lambda_iy_i.$$ So, if I can justify that $\\{x_1,\\ldots,x_{n+m}\\}$ have exactly $n$ linear independent vectors and $\\{y_1,\\ldots,y_{n+m}\\}$ have $m$ linear independent vectors, I will prove that $A$ and $B$ are diagonalizables, but I don't know how to prove that? Please, anyone have an idea? Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "When $C$ is diagonalisable, we have $S^{-1}CS=\\Lambda$ , or equivalently, $CS=S\\Lambda$ for some invertible matrix $S$ and some diagonal matrix $\\Lambda=\\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_{m+n})$ . Hence $$\n\\pmatrix{A&0\\\\ 0&B}\\pmatrix{x_j\\\\ y_j}=\\lambda_j\\pmatrix{x_j\\\\ y_j}\n$$ where $\\pmatrix{x_j\\\\ y_j}$ is the $j$ -th column of $S$ . Consequently $Ax_j=\\lambda_jx_j$ . As $S$ is invertible, the top $n$ rows of $S$ , i.e. the matrix $(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{m+n})$ , must have full row rank, i.e. rank $n$ . Since row rank is always equal to column rank, it follows that the $n\\times n$ submatrix $X=(x_{k_1},x_{k_2},\\ldots,x_{k_n})$ is invertible for some $k_1,\\ldots,k_n\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,m+n\\}$ . Hence the equality $Ax_j=\\lambda_jx_j$ implies that $AX=XD$ , where $D=\\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda_{k_1},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k_n})$ . So $X^{-1}AX=D$ , i.e. $A$ is diagonalisable. For the similar reason, $B$ is diagonalisable too. Remark. As the OP asks for a way to find $n$ linearly independent vectors among $x_1,\\ldots, x_n$ , this answer directly addresses the OP's question. However, in my opinion, the preferred way to show that $A$ and $B$ are diagonalizable is to employ minimal polynomials. See Julien's answer for instance. Sadly, undergraduate linear algebra courses nowadays are not quite \"algebraic\" as they were.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about proving that a block diagonal matrix C is diagonalizable if and only if both A and B are diagonalizable. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe original problem states that the matrix C, which is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B, is diagonalizable if and only if A and B are diagonalizable. The user has managed to show one direction: if A and B are diagonalizable, then C is diagonalizable. But the reverse direction is giving them trouble. They suppose that C is diagonalizable and then try to show that A and B must also be diagonalizable. Their approach is to use the eigenvectors of C to get eigenvectors for A and B, but they're stuck on proving that there are enough linearly independent vectors for A and B.\n\nLet me parse the user's attempt. They mention that if C is diagonalizable, there exists an invertible matrix S whose columns are eigenvectors of C, such that S^{-1}CS is diagonal. Then, each eigenvector S_i of C can be split into parts x_i and y_i corresponding to the dimensions of A and B. The equations Ax_i = λ_i x_i and By_i = λ_i y_i come out, meaning each x_i and y_i are eigenvectors of A and B respectively with the same eigenvalue λ_i. The user wants to show that among these x_i's and y_i's, there are n linearly independent vectors for A and m for B. But they don't know how to prove that.\n\nSo, the problem is to show that if C is diagonalizable, then A and B must be diagonalizable. The user's missing step is ensuring that the eigenvectors of A and B obtained from the eigenvectors of C provide a full set of linearly independent vectors for each block. \n\nNow, the task is to structure this problem into the specified format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\nOriginal problem assumptions:\n1. C is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B, i.e., C = diag(A, B).\n2. A is an n×n matrix, B is an m×m matrix (since C is in GL(C^{n+m})).\n3. C is diagonalizable.\n4. The user is working over the complex numbers (since they mention GL(C^n) and GL(C^m)), which might be important because complex matrices have eigenvalues, but diagonalizability still requires the geometric multiplicity to equal algebraic multiplicity for each eigenvalue.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is trying to prove the \"if and only if\". The example given in the original problem (the A(n) divisible by 91) had assumptions listed as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the example, the assumption was actually that the original problem had n as an integer, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but that seems like the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was wrong. Maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, we need to focus on the current problem.\n\nBut for the current problem about diagonalizable matrices, the user's original problem states: \"Prove that the matrix C = diag(A, B) is diagonalizable if and only if A and B are diagonalizable.\" So the problem is an if and only if statement. The user has proven one direction (if A and B are diagonalizable, then C is), and is stuck on the converse (if C is diagonalizable, then A and B are).\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- C is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B.\n- C is diagonalizable.\n- A is an n×n matrix over the complex numbers.\n- B is an m×m matrix over the complex numbers.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user mentions \"if A ∈ GL(C^n) and B ∈ GL(C^m) are diagonalizable...\", which implies that A and B are invertible (since GL is the general linear group). But in the converse direction, the user is not assuming A and B are invertible, just that C is diagonalizable. Wait, but the problem statement is general: \"the matrix C is diagonalizable if and only if A and B are diagonalizable\". So invertibility might not be part of the problem's assumptions. Wait, in the user's attempt, they mention \"if A ∈ GL(C^n) and B ∈ GL(C^m) are diagonalizable...\", but the problem statement itself is not restricted to invertible matrices. So perhaps the user added the invertibility condition in their own attempt, but the actual problem is more general.\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should include that C is block diagonal with A and B as blocks, and that C is diagonalizable. The problem is to prove that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nWait, but the problem is an if and only if. So in the formatted problem, the user wants to present the reverse direction. But the original problem as stated by the user is the entire if and only if. But when structuring, we need to list the assumptions and the problem. The example given had the original problem's assumptions split into two lines. So for the current problem, the assumptions would include that C is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B, and that C is diagonalizable. Then the problem is to prove that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nWait, but the original problem is an equivalence. So the user wants both directions. But the specific problem part here is the direction where if C is diagonalizable, then A and B are. The other direction is already done by the user. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be that C is block diagonal with A and B, and that C is diagonalizable. The problem is to prove that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nBut also, perhaps the user is working over the complex numbers, but diagonalizability is a field-dependent concept. Since the user mentions GL(C^n), perhaps the field is complex, but that's part of the problem's setup. So the assumptions would include that A and B are square matrices over the complex numbers, and C is their block diagonal matrix, and C is diagonalizable. Then the problem is to show A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nSo putting that together:\n\nAssumption:\nC is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B,\nA is an n×n complex matrix,\nB is an m×m complex matrix,\nC is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify the field, but since they mentioned GL(C^n), it's safe to assume they are working over the complex numbers. However, diagonalizable matrices can be considered over any field, but over algebraically closed fields like C, every matrix has eigenvalues, but diagonalizability requires more. However, the problem doesn't specify that A and B are invertible, so maybe the GL part was just in the user's attempt. So perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nC is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B,\nA is an n×n matrix,\nB is an m×m matrix,\nC is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nBut maybe also, since the user's attempt involves working with eigenvectors over C, perhaps the field is complex, but the problem statement might not require it. However, given the context of GL(C^n), the problem is over the complex field. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nC is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B,\nA is a complex n×n matrix,\nB is a complex m×m matrix,\nC is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not specify the field, but the user's context is over C. But the problem as stated by the user is general, so perhaps the field is arbitrary. Wait, but diagonalizability depends on the field. For example, a matrix might be diagonalizable over C but not over R. However, the problem doesn't specify, but the user's example uses complex matrices. So perhaps the assumption is that we're working over an algebraically closed field, but the user didn't state that. Alternatively, the problem might be over any field. But the answer would depend on that. However, given the user's mention of GL(C^n), it's safe to assume the field is C.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nC is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B,\nA is a complex n×n matrix,\nB is a complex m×m matrix,\nC is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nC is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B,\nA is a square matrix of size n×n,\nB is a square matrix of size m×m,\nC is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nBut since the user is working over the complex numbers, maybe that's part of the assumptions. However, the original problem as stated by the user doesn't specify the field, but their attempt does. So perhaps to be precise, include the field.\n\nAlternatively, the field might not be necessary for the problem's statement, but it's part of the context. But since the example given didn't include the field, perhaps we should omit it unless specified.\n\nWait, the original problem's example didn't mention the field, but in this problem, the user mentioned GL(C^n), which is over complex numbers. So perhaps the field is part of the assumptions.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\nC is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B,\nA is an n×n matrix over the complex numbers,\nB is an m×m matrix over the complex numbers,\nC is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are that C is block diagonal, A and B are square matrices, and C is diagonalizable. The problem is to show A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nI think the critical assumptions here are:\n\n- C is block diagonal with A and B on the diagonal.\n\n- A and B are square matrices (of sizes n and m respectively).\n\n- C is diagonalizable.\n\nThe field being complex might be important, but since diagonalizability can be considered over any field, but the user is working over C, it's safer to include that. However, in the problem statement, the user didn't specify the field, but their attempt uses C. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nC is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B,\nA is a complex n×n matrix,\nB is a complex m×m matrix,\nC is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nThat should capture the necessary conditions. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But that changes the original problem. That example might be incorrect. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding. But regardless, in the current problem, we need to accurately capture the original problem's assumptions.\n\nThe user's problem is to prove the equivalence: C is diagonalizable iff A and B are. The user can do one direction but not the other. The formatted problem should present the direction they are struggling with. So the assumptions when proving that C diagonalizable implies A and B diagonalizable are:\n\n- C is block diagonal with A and B.\n\n- C is diagonalizable.\n\n- A and B are square matrices (sizes n and m).\n\nPossibly over complex numbers, given the context.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nC is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B,\nA is a complex n×n matrix,\nB is a complex m×m matrix,\nC is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nAlternatively, if the field is not specified, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nC is a block diagonal matrix with blocks A and B,\nA is an n×n matrix,\nB is an m×m matrix,\nC is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are diagonalizable.\n\nBut since the user's context involves GL(C^n), indicating the field is complex, it's better to include that. Therefore, the final formatted problem should include the complex field in the assumptions.",
