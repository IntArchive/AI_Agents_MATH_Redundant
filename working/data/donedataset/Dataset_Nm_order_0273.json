    "Content": "I have an n-dimensional hyperplane: $w'x + b = 0$ and a point $x_0$. The shortest distance from this point to a hyperplane is $d = \\frac{|w \\cdot x_0+ b|}{||w||}$. I have no problem to prove this for 2 and 3 dimension space using algebraic manipulations, but fail to do this for an n-dimensional space. Can someone show a nice explanation for it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are many ways to solve this problem. In principal one can use Lagrange multipliers and solve a large system of equations, but my attempt to do so met with a road block. However, since you are working in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ we have the privilege of orthogonal projection via the dot product. To this end we need to construct a vector from the plane to $x_0$ to project onto a vector perpendicular to the plane. Then we compute the length of the projection to determine the distance from the plane to the point. First, you have an affine hyperplane defined by $w \\cdot x + b=0$ and a point $x_0$. Suppose that $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a point satisfying $w \\cdot X+b=0$, i.e. it is a point on the plane. You should construct the vector $x_0 - X$ which points from $X$ to $x_0$ so that you can project it onto the unique vector perpendicular to the plane. Some quick reasoning should tell you that this vector is, in fact, $w$. So we want to compute $\\| \\text{proj}_{w} (x_0-X)\\|$. Some handy formulas give us\n$$ d=\\| \\text{proj}_{w} (x_0-X)\\| = \\left\\| \\frac{(x_0-X)\\cdot w}{w \\cdot w} w \\right\\| = |x_0 \\cdot w - X \\cdot w|\\frac{\\|w\\|}{\\|w\\|^2} = \\frac{|x_0 \\cdot w - X \\cdot w|}{\\|w\\|}$$\nWe chose $X$ such that $w\\cdot X=-b$ so we get\n$$ d=\\| \\text{proj}_{w} (x_0-X)\\| = \\frac{|x_0 \\cdot w +b|}{\\|w\\|} $$\nas desired. This almost seems like cheating and purely heuristic based on Euclidean geometry. Indeed, I would be more satisfied with a solution via Lagrange multipliers since it would not have required the fact that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has an inner product and just needed the topology of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ instead. But we have the inner product, so maybe geometry will suffice for us this time. To make this argument more concrete you should do each step in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ for a line $y=mx+b$ and a point $(x_0,y_0)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the distance from a point to a hyperplane in n-dimensional space is given by the formula d = |w·x0 + b| / ||w||. They mentioned they can do it in 2D and 3D but are struggling with n-dimensions. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how the proof works in lower dimensions. In 2D, a hyperplane is a line, and the distance from a point to the line can be found by projecting the vector from a point on the line to x0 onto the normal vector w. Then, dividing by the norm of w gives the distance. Similarly, in 3D, it's the same idea but with a plane.\n\nSo, generalizing this to n-dimensions: the hyperplane is defined by w·x + b = 0. The normal vector to the hyperplane is w. To find the distance from x0 to the hyperplane, we can take any point x1 on the hyperplane and compute the projection of the vector (x0 - x1) onto the normal vector w. The length of this projection should be the distance d.\n\nLet me write that out. Let x1 be a point on the hyperplane, so w·x1 + b = 0. The vector from x1 to x0 is (x0 - x1). The projection of this vector onto w is [(x0 - x1)·w] / ||w||. The absolute value of this divided by ||w|| gives the distance. But since x1 is on the hyperplane, w·x1 = -b. So substituting that in, the numerator becomes |w·x0 - (-b)| = |w·x0 + b|. Hence, d = |w·x0 + b| / ||w||. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned they already know the formula and need to prove it. So the key steps are:\n\n1. Take a point x1 on the hyperplane.\n2. Express the distance as the length of the projection of (x0 - x1) onto the normal vector w.\n3. Use the hyperplane equation to substitute w·x1 = -b.\n4. Simplify the expression to get the formula.\n\nI need to make sure that all these steps are valid in n-dimensions. The projection formula and the normal vector concept generalize to any dimension, so the same approach should work. There's no need for geometric intuitions that only hold in 2D or 3D. The algebraic manipulation should suffice.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using calculus: minimize the distance from x0 to any point x on the hyperplane. The distance squared is ||x - x0||², subject to w·x + b = 0. Using Lagrange multipliers, set up the function to minimize: ||x - x0||² + λ(w·x + b). Taking derivative w.r.t. x and setting to zero gives 2(x - x0) + λw = 0. Solving for x gives x = x0 - (λ/2)w. Substitute back into the hyperplane equation: w·(x0 - (λ/2)w) + b = 0 → w·x0 - (λ/2)||w||² + b = 0 → λ = 2(w·x0 + b)/||w||². Then the minimal distance is ||x - x0|| = ||-(λ/2)w|| = |λ/2| ||w|| = |w·x0 + b| / ||w||. That also gives the same formula.\n\nBut the user might be looking for a more geometric explanation rather than calculus. Either way, both methods work in n-dimensions. The projection method is probably simpler for the user since they mentioned algebraic manipulations in lower dimensions.\n\nSo, structuring the problem according to the required format: the assumptions would include that we're working in n-dimensional space, the hyperplane is defined by w·x + b = 0, and x0 is a point in that space. The problem is to prove the distance formula. The original question didn't mention any specific constraints on w or b, except that the hyperplane is n-dimensional. So the main assumption is that w is the normal vector, and the hyperplane is non-degenerate (i.e., w is not the zero vector). But since the formula includes ||w||, it's implied that ||w|| ≠ 0, so w ≠ 0. So that should be an assumption.",
