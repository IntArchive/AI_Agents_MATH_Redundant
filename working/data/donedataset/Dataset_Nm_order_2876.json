    "Content": "I'm 9th grade student, and my teacher said that $|x|$ is not rational expression ( expression like $\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ s.t $p(x)$ and $q(x)\\neq 0$ are polynomial) but he didn't have convincing reason. One of my friends said that it is provable by use of differential, but I don't know about calculus. Is there any proof for this fact, without use of calculus?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If there were polynomials $p$ and $q$ such that $|x|=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ for all $x\\in\\Bbb R$, then $\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ would be defined for all $x\\in\\Bbb R$, and $q(x)$ could never be $0$. Moreover, we’d have $p(x)=|x|q(x)$ for all $x\\in\\Bbb R$. If $x\\ge 0$, this means that $p(x)=xq(x)$, and if $x<0$ it means that $p(x)=-xq(x)$. Let $r(x)=p(x)-xq(x)$; this is certainly a polynomial, and $$r(x)=\\begin{cases}\n0,&\\text{if }x\\ge 0\\\\\n-2xq(x),&\\text{if }x<0\\;.\n\\end{cases}$$ I’m going to assume that you know that a polynomial of degree $n\\ge 1$ has at most $n$ real roots, though you’ve probably never seen a proof. Our supposed polynomial $r(x)$ evidently has infinitely many real roots, since each non-negative real is a root, so it must be the constant function $r(x)\\equiv 0$. But then $-2xq(x)=0$ for each $x<0$, and it follows that $q(x)=0$ for each $x<0$. We saw at the beginning that this is impossible: $q(x)$ can never be $0$. This contradiction shows that in fact no such polynomials $p$ and $q$ exist, and $|x|$ is not a rational function.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out why |x| isn't a rational function. So, the problem is asking to prove that the absolute value of x, which is |x|, can't be written as a ratio of two polynomials p(x) and q(x), where q(x) isn't zero. The user mentioned that they're a 9th-grade student, so they probably don't know calculus, which means I need to think of a way without using derivatives or integrals.\n\nFirst, I remember that rational functions are fractions where both numerator and denominator are polynomials. Polynomials have terms with non-negative integer exponents, right? So, for example, something like 3x^2 + 2x + 1 is a polynomial, and a rational function would be like (3x^2 + 2)/(x + 5).\n\nNow, |x| is defined as x when x is non-negative and -x when x is negative. So, it's a piecewise function. But polynomials and rational functions are smooth everywhere except where the denominator is zero. Maybe the problem with |x| is that it has a corner at x=0, which polynomials don't have. But wait, the user said not to use calculus, so talking about differentiability might not be allowed.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the behavior of |x| versus rational functions. For example, rational functions can have asymptotes, but |x| doesn't. On the other hand, |x| is V-shaped, which might not match the behavior of any rational function. But how to formalize that?\n\nAnother approach: suppose |x| = p(x)/q(x), where p and q are polynomials. Then, cross-multiplying, we get |x| q(x) = p(x). Let's consider x >= 0 and x < 0 separately. For x >= 0, |x| = x, so x q(x) = p(x). For x < 0, |x| = -x, so -x q(x) = p(x). So, for x > 0, p(x) = x q(x), and for x < 0, p(x) = -x q(x). But polynomials are defined for all real numbers, and they must agree on overlapping domains except at x=0. Wait, but x=0 is just a single point. Let's see.\n\nIf p(x) and q(x) are polynomials, then p(x) must equal x q(x) for all x >= 0 and also equal -x q(x) for all x < 0. But polynomials that agree on infinitely many points must be identical. However, x q(x) and -x q(x) can only be the same polynomial if x q(x) = -x q(x) for all x, which would imply that 2x q(x) = 0 for all x, which would mean q(x) is the zero polynomial, but q(x) can't be zero. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. Hence, |x| can't be a rational function.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Suppose we have p(x) = x q(x) for x >= 0 and p(x) = -x q(x) for x < 0. But polynomials are defined for all real numbers, so the polynomial p(x) must satisfy both equations for all x. But for x positive, p(x) = x q(x), and for x negative, p(x) = -x q(x). Let's consider substituting x = -a where a > 0. Then, p(-a) = -(-a) q(-a) = a q(-a). But since p(x) is a polynomial, p(-a) must also equal (-a) q(-a) if we use the x >= 0 case, but x here is -a which is negative. Wait, maybe I need to think of extending the equations.\n\nAlternatively, if p(x) = x q(x) for all x, then substituting x with -x, we get p(-x) = (-x) q(-x). But if we also have that for x < 0, p(x) = -x q(x). Let x = -t where t > 0. Then p(-t) = -(-t) q(-t) = t q(-t). But according to the polynomial p(x) = x q(x), when we plug in x = -t, we get p(-t) = (-t) q(-t). Therefore, we have two expressions for p(-t): (-t) q(-t) from the x >=0 case, and t q(-t) from the x <0 case. Therefore, (-t) q(-t) = t q(-t) => (-t - t) q(-t) = 0 => -2t q(-t) = 0. Since this must hold for all t >0, then q(-t) must be zero for all t>0, which would mean q(x) is zero for all x <0. But a polynomial that is zero for infinitely many points must be the zero polynomial, which contradicts q(x) ≠ 0. Therefore, our assumption that |x| is a rational function leads to a contradiction, so |x| cannot be a rational function.\n\nYes, that seems like a valid argument without using calculus. So the key idea is that if |x| were a rational function, then the polynomial p(x) would have to satisfy contradictory conditions on positive and negative x, forcing the denominator to be zero, which isn't allowed.\n\nAnother way: suppose |x| = p(x)/q(x), then for x ≠0, |x| = p(x)/q(x). For x >0, this is x = p(x)/q(x), so p(x) = x q(x). For x <0, this is -x = p(x)/q(x), so p(x) = -x q(x). So the polynomial p(x) is equal to x q(x) for x >0 and -x q(x) for x <0. But polynomials are determined by their values on an infinite set, so the expressions x q(x) and -x q(x) must agree as polynomials. So, x q(x) = -x q(x) for all x, which implies that 2x q(x) =0 for all x, hence q(x) is zero polynomial, which is a contradiction. Therefore, |x| isn't rational.",
