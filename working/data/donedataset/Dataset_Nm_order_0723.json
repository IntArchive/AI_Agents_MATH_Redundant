    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified structure. The example provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, with each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement itself.\n\nThe original problem here is \"Prove that Every compact metric space is separable\". First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The problem is about proving a statement in topology. Let's break down the components.\n\nA compact metric space: So the space in question must be a metric space, and it must be compact. Those are two separate properties. The metric space part gives it a metric, hence the topology is induced by the metric. Compactness here is in the topological sense, meaning every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The space is a metric space.\n2. The space is compact.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. There's no mention of any other conditions like being Hausdorff or second-countable, but since it's a metric space, some properties like being Hausdorff are already implied. However, the key assumptions here are metric space and compactness.\n\nThe problem is to prove that such a space is separable. Separable means having a countable dense subset. So the problem statement is straightforward once the assumptions are laid out.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the user's example had the problem statement mentioning \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Maybe that example was incorrect. But perhaps the user intended that the problem had a mistake, but actually, in the original example, the user might have intended to present a problem where n is divisible by 7. Hmm, perhaps there's confusion. Anyway, I need to focus on the current problem, which is about compact metric spaces being separable.\n\nSo, back to the problem at hand. The assumptions are:\n\n1. The space is a metric space.\n2. The space is compact.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove that the space is separable.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list these two assumptions, each on their own line, and then state the problem as proving separability.\n\nI don't see any other assumptions here. The problem is straightforward. The user might have included an example where additional assumptions were listed, but in this case, the problem only has the two main assumptions: metric space and compactness. So I'll proceed with that.",
