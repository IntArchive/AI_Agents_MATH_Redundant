    "Content": "Let $n \\geq 1$ be an odd integer. Show that $D_{2n}\\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times D_n$ . I define a map $$\\phi:D_{2n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times D_n$$ by $R \\mapsto (0,r^{\\frac{n+1}{2}})$ and $M \\mapsto(1,m)$ . Then I am stuck at showing the map is bijective. By the way, do we need to show that $(0,r^{\\frac{n+1}{2}})(1,m)(0,r^{\\frac{n+1}{2}})^{-1}=(1,m)$ ? If we can prove this, then what can we conclude?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's look at your map--let's call it $\\phi$ . I claim that it fails to be surjective. Suppose it is surjective, so in particular, $\\phi(R^jM^k)=(1,e)$ for some natural $j,k$ . Now, $$\\phi(R^j)=\\phi(R)^j=\\bigl(0,r^{\\frac{n+1}2}\\bigr)^j=\\bigl(j\\cdot 0,r^{j\\cdot\\frac{n+1}2}\\bigr)=\\bigl(0,r^{j\\cdot\\frac{n+1}2}\\bigr)$$ and $$\\phi(M^k)=\\phi(M)^k=(1,m)^k=(k\\cdot 1,m^k)=(k,m^k),$$ so $$\\begin{align}(1,e) &= \\phi(R^jM^k)\\\\ &= \\phi(R^j)\\phi(M^k)\\\\ &= \\bigl(0,r^{j\\cdot\\frac{n+1}2}\\bigr)(k,m^k)\\\\ &= \\bigl(0+k,r^{j\\cdot\\frac{n+1}2}m^k\\bigr)\\\\ &= \\bigl(k,r^{j\\cdot\\frac{n+1}2}m^k\\bigr).\\end{align}$$ Then $k$ must be odd (since $1=k$ modulo $2$ ), but if $k$ is odd, then we can't have $r^{j\\cdot\\frac{n+1}2}m^k=e$ , so we have a contradiction. Finding an isomorphism is (in many cases) quite a bit out of our way, but let's go ahead and do it here anyway. Whatever we map $R$ to is going to have to have order $2n$ for the map to be injective. (Why?) A convenient choice is $(1,r),$ because $$(0,e)=(1,r)^k=(k,r^k)$$ implies that $k$ is even (since $k=0$ modulo $2$ ) and that $n$ divides $k$ (since $r^k=e$ and $r$ has order $n$ ), whence $k$ is an integer multiple of $2n$ (since $n$ is odd). Whatever we map $M$ to can't be in the subgroup of $\\Bbb Z_2\\times D_n$ generated by $(1,r)$ (why not?). An easy choice then is $(1,m).$ Now, let's prove surjectivity by showing that every member of a generating set of $\\Bbb Z_2\\times D_n$ is mapped to by the homomorphism $\\Phi:D_{2n}\\to\\Bbb Z_2\\times D_n$ induced by $R\\mapsto(1,r),M\\mapsto(1,m).$ (Why is this enough?) A nice generating set of $\\Bbb Z_2\\times D_n$ is $$\\bigl\\{(1,e),(0,r),(0,m)\\bigr\\},$$ and it can be determined that $$\\Phi(R^n)=(1,e),\\;\\Phi(R^{n+1})=(0,r),\\text{ and }\\Phi(R^nM)=(0,m).$$ Since we're dealing with finite groups of the same order, then surjectivity is the same as injectivity, so we're done. The approach above was fairly tedious, and we'd generally like to avoid using it. Instead, consider the following Theorem : Let $G,H,K$ be (multiplicative) groups. Then $G\\cong H\\times K$ if and only if $G$ has normal subgroups $H',K'$ such that $H'\\cong H,K'\\cong K,H'\\cap K'=\\{\\text{id}_G\\},$ and $$G=H'K':=\\{hk:h\\in H',k\\in K'\\}.$$ Proving the above result is a nice exercise (let me know if you want any hints on how to prove the backward direction). It then yields the following Corollary : Let $G,H,K$ be finite (multiplicative) groups. Then $G\\cong H\\times K$ if and only if $G$ has normal subgroups $H',K'$ such that $H'\\cong H,K'\\cong K,\\text{ and }H'\\cap K'=\\{\\text{id}_G\\}.$ By the Corollary, we need only find normal subgroups of $D_{2n}$ isomorphic to $\\Bbb Z_2$ and $D_n$ , whose intersection is precisely $\\{E\\}.$ The subgroup generated by $R^2$ and $M$ should do the trick as a subgroup isomorphic to $D_n$ (automatically normal, since it has index $2$ ), and since $R^n$ has order $2$ and commutes with everything, then the subgroup it generates is normal and isomorphic to $\\Bbb Z_2$ . Edit : Sadly, the Corollary is false in the form shown above! (Credit to Geralt of Rivia for pointing out the issue.) Another condition is needed. If we add the hypothesis that $\\|H\\|\\cdot\\|K\\|=\\|G\\|,$ that gets us the rest of the way. As far as the specific example goes, since we readily have $\\left\\|D_{2n}\\right\\|=2\\cdot\\left\\|D_n\\right\\|,$ then the adjusted Corollary gets us there.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about showing that the dihedral group D_{2n} is isomorphic to the direct product of Z_2 and D_n when n is an odd integer greater than or equal to 1. The user defined a map phi from D_{2n} to Z_2 × D_n, sending R to (0, r^{(n+1)/2}) and M to (1, m). They are stuck on proving the map is bijective and have a specific question about conjugation.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. The original problem states that n is an odd integer and n ≥ 1. So the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 1.\n- n is odd.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Let n ≥ 1 be an odd integer.\" So combining these, but according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So separate into three? But n being an integer and n ≥1 and n is odd. However, in the example given, the user separated \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So here, similarly, the three assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 1.\n- n is odd.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"Let n ≥ 1 be an odd integer,\" so maybe \"n is an odd integer\" and \"n ≥ 1\" are two separate conditions. However, the first line in the example was \"n is an integer\" and the second \"n is divisible by 7.\" So perhaps here, since the problem states \"n ≥ 1 be an odd integer,\" the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 1.\n- n is odd.\n\nEach on separate lines. Because \"n is an odd integer\" is a single condition, but in the example, they separated \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So perhaps here, \"n is an integer\" is one assumption, and \"n is odd\" is another. Then \"n ≥ 1\" is another assumption.\n\nSo the problem statement is to show that D_{2n} is isomorphic to Z_2 × D_n under these assumptions.\n\nNow, the user's specific question is about defining the map phi and getting stuck on showing it's bijective. They also have a side question about conjugation. But in the problem formatting, we need to present the problem as it is, without the user's specific stuck points. Because in the example, the formatted problem was just \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" even though the original problem included more details. Wait, looking back at the example, the original problem had the definition of A(n), so the formatted problem included that. Here, the problem is to show the isomorphism, so perhaps the problem statement is exactly \"Show that D_{2n} ≅ Z_2 × D_n.\"\n\nBut the user defined a specific map and is stuck on bijectivity. However, in the example, the user's original problem included an expression for A(n), and the formatted problem included that expression. So in this case, maybe the problem should include the definition of the map phi? Wait, but the example didn't include the user's approach. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem was the same. The user in the example had written A(n) with the formula, so the formatted problem included that. Here, the problem is \"Show that D_{2n} ≅ Z_2 × D_n,\" and the user is using a specific map. But in the problem formatting, should we include the map or not? The example didn't include the user's attempt, only the problem's original statement. Wait, the user's original problem here is \"Show that D_{2n} ≅ Z_2 × D_n,\" and the user attempted to define a map phi. But the problem itself is to show the isomorphism, so the formatted problem should be just that, with the assumptions. The user's attempt is part of their question but not part of the problem statement. Therefore, the problem statement is \"Show that D_{2n} is isomorphic to Z_2 × D_n,\" with the assumptions on n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 1.\n- n is odd.\n\nProblem:\nShow that D_{2n} ≅ ℤ_2 × D_n.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user had an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7,\" but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. However, the formatted problem's assumptions included \"n is divisible by 7,\" which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7.\" That can't be right. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nThe user-provided example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the user's example was wrong. Therefore, the assistant needs to be careful here. But according to the user's example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't have that. So perhaps in their formatting, the assumptions are derived from the problem's conditions. Wait, maybe in the original problem, the divisibility by 91 requires that n satisfies certain conditions, but the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which would mean no additional assumptions. Therefore, the example might have been incorrect. But given that, the user's instruction is to follow their example, even if it's flawed. Therefore, in the current problem, the original question states \"Let n ≥ 1 be an odd integer,\" which translates to three assumptions: n is integer, n ≥1, n is odd.\n\nTherefore, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 1.\n- n is odd.\n\nProblem:\nShow that D_{2n} ≅ ℤ_2 × D_n.\n\nBut the user's problem also mentions defining a map phi and being stuck on showing it's bijective. However, the problem statement is to show the isomorphism, regardless of the approach. Therefore, the formatted problem should just be the problem statement with the given assumptions. The user's specific approach with the map phi is part of their solution attempt, not part of the problem statement. Therefore, the problem remains as above.",
