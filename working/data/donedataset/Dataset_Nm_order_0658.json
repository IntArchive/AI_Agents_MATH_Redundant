    "Content": "Recently, I stumbled upon what I believe to be a new representation of $\\zeta(\\sigma+i t)^b$ by chance, and thus have no proof of it, and I am wondering if it is possible to prove. Let $\\eta (s) = \\zeta (s) (1-2^{1-s})$ denote the Dirichlet eta function, where $\\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function and $s = \\sigma + i t$ . Motivation: To motivative the potential usefulness of this representation, notice that $\\zeta$ is transformed from taking a complex argument, to a real argument, allowing safer manipulations with it, as log singularities are no longer as major of an issue. I've had Mathematica numerically verify the conjecture on a few hundred combinations of $\\sigma, t$ , and $b$ , each time producing the correct values- as far as I can tell, it even seems to behave appropriately near $\\zeta$ zeros, from approaching the first few zeros, above and below the real line, from all directions. $\\forall \\sigma, t, b \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ : $$\\eta (s)^b-1=\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\cos(\\sqrt{t}x e^{i \\pi/4})\\cos(x y)\\left(\\eta(\\sigma+y^2)^b-1\\right)\\,dy\\,dx$$ Is it possible to prove/disprove this representation? A suggestion by @DinosaurEgg was the fact that a Fourier inversion formula indicates: $$f(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos \\left(y\\left(x-t\\right)\\right) f(x) \\, dx \\, dy$$ which for even functions can be written as $$f(t) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\cos \\left( x y \\right) \\cos \\left( y t\\right) f(x) \\, dx \\, dy$$ However, to my knowledge, Fourier inversion only generally holds for functions $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ so perhaps the Paley-Wiener theorem is at play here to allow my $\\eta$ representation to hold, however, I’m not sure how to apply it here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "With $\\sigma > -2$ , $H(y)=\\eta(\\sigma+y^2)^b-1$ is Schwartz on the real line so we can look at its inverse Fourier transform, which is Schwartz again $$h(x)=\\frac1{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i xy} H(y)dy$$ And for all $u\\in \\Bbb{R}$ $$H(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty  e^{-i x u}h(x)dx\\tag{1}$$ When $\\color{red}{b\\text{ is an integer}}$ , $H$ is entire and Schwartz on every horizontal line. The Cauchy integral theorem gives that for any $r$ $$h(x)=\\frac1{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i x(y+ir)} H(y+ir)dy$$ from which $$|h(x)|\\le e^{-r |x|} C_r, \\qquad C_r=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (|H(y+ir)|+|H(y-ir)|)dy$$ This implies that there won't be any problem in continuing $(1)$ analytically to $\\color{red}{\\text{ every } u\\in \\Bbb{C}}$ , obtaining $$\\forall u\\in \\Bbb{C}, \\qquad H(u)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty  e^{-i x u}h(x)dx$$ With $u=\\sqrt{it}$ it gives the formula in your question. When $b$ is not an integer, we can only do the Cauchy integral theorem up to $r = \\sqrt{2+\\sigma}$ , so that $(1)$ stays convergent and valid only for $|\\Im(u)|\\le \\sqrt{2+\\sigma}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and format it according to the user's requirements. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nThe original question is about proving or disproving a certain integral representation of the Dirichlet eta function raised to a power. The user mentions that they found this representation by chance and had Mathematica verify it numerically. They also reference a Fourier inversion formula suggested by another user, DinosaurEgg, and mention the Paley-Wiener theorem as a possible avenue.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is then restated clearly.\n\nSo, first, let's extract the assumptions. The problem involves the Dirichlet eta function η(s) = ζ(s)(1 - 2^{1-s}), where s = σ + it. The variables σ, t, and b are all real numbers greater than or equal to zero. The integral expression given is supposed to hold for all σ, t, b in ℝ≥0. \n\nThe user also mentions that Fourier inversion usually applies to functions f: ℝ → ℂ, but here they might be extending it using Paley-Wiener. However, the main assumptions needed for the problem are the definitions and conditions given explicitly. The conjecture is about the integral representation holding under these conditions.\n\nPotential assumptions:\n1. η(s) is defined as ζ(s)(1 - 2^{1-s}).\n2. s = σ + it where σ, t are real numbers.\n3. σ, t, b are non-negative real numbers (σ, t, b ∈ ℝ≥0).\n4. The integral representation is conjectured to hold for all such σ, t, b.\n\nThe problem is to prove or disprove this integral representation. The user also references Fourier inversion and Paley-Wiener, but those are part of their thought process rather than assumptions of the problem itself. The key assumptions are the definitions and the domain of the variables.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumption: Each line should be one assumption. So:\n\n- η(s) = ζ(s)(1 - 2^{1-s}), where ζ is the Riemann zeta function.\n- s = σ + it with σ and t being real numbers.\n- σ, t, b are non-negative real numbers (σ, t, b ∈ ℝ≥0).\n- The integral representation involves a double integral over [0, ∞) for both x and y.\n\nWait, the original problem states that the conjecture is for all σ, t, b ∈ ℝ≥0. So that's an assumption on the variables. Also, the definition of η(s) is given, which is an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. η(s) is defined as ζ(s)(1 - 2^{1-s}).\n2. s = σ + it where σ, t ∈ ℝ.\n3. σ, t, b are non-negative real numbers (σ, t, b ∈ ℝ≥0).\n4. The integral expression is conjectured to hold under these conditions.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\n- First assumption defines η(s) in terms of ζ(s).\n- Second assumption defines s as σ + it with σ and t real.\n- Third assumption states that σ, t, b are in ℝ≥0.\n- The integral itself is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nWait, the problem is the conjecture that the integral equals η(s)^b - 1. So the assumptions are the conditions under which this conjecture is made. Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n- η(s) = ζ(s)(1 - 2^{1-s}).\n- s is a complex number with s = σ + it, where σ and t are real numbers.\n- σ, t, and b are non-negative real numbers (σ, t, b ∈ ℝ≥0).\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for all σ, t, b ∈ ℝ≥0, the equation\nη(s)^b - 1 = (2/π) ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ cos(√t x e^{iπ/4}) cos(x y) (η(σ + y²)^b - 1) dy dx\nholds.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line. For example, the definition of η(s) is one line. Then the definition of s as σ + it is another. Then the conditions on σ, t, b. Each of these is a separate line.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nη(s) = ζ(s)(1 - 2^{1-s}),\ns = σ + it where σ and t are real numbers,\nσ, t, b are non-negative real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for all σ, t, b ∈ ℝ≥0,\nη(s)^b -1 = (2/π) ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ cos(√t x e^{iπ/4}) cos(x y) (η(σ + y²)^b -1) dy dx.\n\nCheck if any other assumptions are present. The user mentions that Fourier inversion holds for functions f: ℝ → ℂ, but that's part of their reasoning, not an assumption of the problem. The main assumptions are those given in the problem statement.\n\nThus, the answer should be structured as above.",
