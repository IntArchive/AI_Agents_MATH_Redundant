    "Content": "I would like to understand why the two rings\n$$\nR={\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}/{(xy - (1 - z^2))} \\\\ S=\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/{(x^2y - (1 - z^2))}\n$$\nare not isomorphic, but $R[t]\\cong S[t]$. This example is discussed in this document by Hochster. He references a paper by Danielewski, but it is a preprint from 1989, so I could not locate it anywhere. In fact, this example was also given by Timothy Wagner in this MSE thread , but no proof was supplied. Finally, this MSE thread seems to refer to this problem (though possibly with different formulation), but unfortunately it hasn't even received a single comment in the last 3.5 years. Can someone either find a precise reference (preferably online, or at least published in some book/journal) or supply a proof for this claim?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First of all, a good friend of mine wrote a nice exposition of this topic! Also, there is a very nice overview by Kraft: \" Challenging problems on affine $n$ -space \". R $\\not\\cong$ S There are two methods I found of proving this: Topological method (Danielewski, Fieseler , tom Dieck ). Let X , Y be the surfaces in $\\mathbf{C}^3$ defined by $xy-(1-z^2)$ and $x^2y-(1-z^2)$ , respectively. Then, their fundamental groups at infinity are not isomorphic, in particular $$\\pi_1^\\infty(X) \\cong \\mathbf{Z}/2\\mathbf{Z}, \\qquad \\pi_1^\\infty(Y) \\cong \\mathbf{Z}/4\\mathbf{Z}.$$ Danielewsi and Fieseler showed similar statements for the first homology groups at infinity; the former showed $H_1^\\infty(X) \\cong \\mathbf{Z}/2\\mathbf{Z}$ and that 4 divides the order of $H_1^\\infty(Y)$ , while Fieseler was able to compute them. Tom Dieck computed the $\\pi_1^\\infty$ . Algebraic method (Makar-Limanov). For $A$ a $\\mathbf{C}$ -algebra, recall that a $\\mathbf{C}$ -endomorphism $\\delta\\colon A \\to A$ is a derivation if it satisfies the Leibniz rule. Denote by $A^\\delta$ the kernel of a derivation $\\delta$ . We call a derivation $\\delta$ locally nilpotent if for every $a \\in A$ there is an $n$ such that $\\delta^n(a) = 0$ , and denote the set of these $\\delta$ as $\\operatorname{LND}(A)$ . Finally, the AK-invariant denoted $\\operatorname{AK}(A)$ of $A$ is the intersection of the kernels of all locally nilpotent derivations, i.e., $$\\operatorname{AK}(A) := \\bigcap_{\\delta \\in \\operatorname{LND}(A)} A^\\delta.$$ Then, Makar-Limanov showed that $\\operatorname{AK}(R) = \\mathbf{C}$ , while $\\operatorname{AK}(S) = \\mathbf{C}[x]$ . The former is simple to show, since $$x \\mapsto 0, \\quad y \\mapsto -2z, \\quad z \\mapsto x$$ is a locally nilpotent derivation with kernel $\\mathbf{C}[x]$ , and since we can replace $x \\leftrightarrow y$ to get a locally nilpotent derivation with kernel $\\mathbf{C}[y]$ . The other computation is a bit more difficult; see Makar-Limanov's \" On the group of automorphisms of a surface $x^ny = P(z)$ \". There is a nice textbook discussion of this in Rowen's Graduate algebra: commutative view , starting at p. 201. R [ t ] $\\cong$ S [ t ] The idea is as follows, following Rem. 1.5 in Fieseler . Both $X$ and $Y$ can be realized as $\\mathbf{G}_a$ -principal bundles over the line $V$ with two origins; see one of Prof. Speyer's answers on MathOverflow (which is for a slightly different defining equation, but a similar glueing argument should work). Then, in the cartesian square $$\\require{AMScd}\n\\begin{CD}\nX \\times_V Y @>>> Y\\\\\n@VVV @VVV\\\\\nX @>>> V\n\\end{CD}\n$$ all maps are projections of $\\mathbf{G}_a$ -principal bundles. Since $X$ and $Y$ are both affine, $H^1(X,\\mathbf{G}_a) = H^1(Y,\\mathbf{G}_a) = 0$ , and so by Hilbert's theorem 90 (see Serre's \" Espaces fibrés algébriques ,\" §2.3), $X \\times \\mathbf{C} \\cong X \\times_V Y \\cong Y \\times \\mathbf{C}$ is a trivial $\\mathbf{G}_a$ -principal bundle over both $X$ and $Y$ . I would love to know if the last isomorphism can be written out explicitly!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants the assumptions and the problem structured according to the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The question is about two rings R and S defined as quotients of polynomial rings, and the claim is that R and S are not isomorphic, but their polynomial extensions R[t] and S[t] are isomorphic. The user is asking for a proof or a reference for this claim.\n\nNow, applying the format: The \"Assumption\" section should list each condition applied to one object. Let's identify the assumptions.\n\n1. R is defined as the quotient ring ℂ[x,y,z]/(xy - (1 - z²)).\n2. S is defined as the quotient ring ℂ[x,y,z]/(x²y - (1 - z²)).\n3. R and S are not isomorphic as rings.\n4. The polynomial rings R[t] and S[t] are isomorphic as rings.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption about each object (R, S, their isomorphism status, and their polynomial extensions). The problem then is to understand why R ≇ S but R[t] ≅ S[t], which is already stated, but according to the example, the problem section restates the problem to prove these two points. However, the original question seems to accept that R ≇ S and R[t] ≅ S[t] are given, and the user is asking for a proof or reference. But according to the example, the assumptions should include the given conditions, and the problem is to prove the statements.\n\nWait, the example's assumptions included the conditions (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. In this case, the problem as presented in the original question is that R and S are not isomorphic but their polynomial rings are. The user is asking for an explanation or proof of that. So, the assumptions would be the definitions of R and S, and the problem is to prove the two claims: non-isomorphism of R and S, and isomorphism of R[t] and S[t]. However, in the example, the assumptions included the conditions given in the problem (like n being integer and divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove the divisibility. Here, the problem is to show two things: R ≇ S and R[t] ≅ S[t]. But the way the user presented the question is that these are claims (they are stated as facts), and the user is asking for a proof. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of R and S, and the problem is to prove the two statements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the definitions of R and S, and the problem is to show that R ≇ S but R[t] ≅ S[t]. So in the Assumption section, each line is a property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nR is the ring ℂ[x,y,z]/(xy - (1 - z²)),\nS is the ring ℂ[x,y,z]/(x²y - (1 - z²)),\nR is not isomorphic to S,\nR[t] is isomorphic to S[t].\n\nBut wait, the original problem states that they are not isomorphic but their polynomial rings are. The user wants to understand why. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of R and S, and the problem is to prove that R ≇ S and R[t] ≅ S[t]. But the example's assumptions included the given conditions (like n being integer and divisible by 7), which are part of the problem's hypotheses. Here, the problem's hypotheses are that R and S are defined as such. So the Assumptions should list the definitions of R and S. Then the Problem is to prove the two claims. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nR is the quotient ring ℂ[x,y,z]/(xy - (1 - z²)),\nS is the quotient ring ℂ[x,y,z]/(x²y - (1 - z²)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that R is not isomorphic to S but R[t] is isomorphic to S[t].\n\nBut the original problem says \"why the two rings ... are not isomorphic, but R[t] ≅ S[t]\". So the problem is to explain/prove those two points. So the formatted problem should have the assumptions as the definitions of R and S, and the problem is to prove the two claims. That seems correct. Each assumption line is about one object (R and S) and their respective definitions. The problem is the two-part claim.",
