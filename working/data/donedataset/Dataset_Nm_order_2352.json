    "Content": "I'm trying to understand Chapter 12, Section 11 in Cartan + Eilenberg's Homological Algebra , which concerns finite groups with periodic cohomology. Unfortunately I am jumping right to this section in the book (I've been working in Serre's Local Fields , and I'm doing the exercise at the end of Chapter 8, Section 4, which refers to the above section in Cartan + Eilenberg), so I'm a little disconcerted with the notation change (and things like using $(\\Pi:1)$ for the order of the group $\\Pi$ - what is up with that?) I suppose I have two main questions. How do we know that, given a finite group $G$ with periodic cohomology, say with $${\\widehat{H}}{}^n(G,A)\\cong\\!\\!\\!{\\widehat{H}}{}^{n+q}(G,A)$$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ for some $q\\in\\mathbb{N}$, these isomorphisms must be given by cup-producting with a fixed element $g\\in\\widehat{H}{}^q(G,\\mathbb{Z})$? This seems to be an implicit assumption in their investigation, and while I can very well believe that it's true (the cup-product satisfies some universal property, if I understand correctly), I don't see what's barring the isomorphisms from being \"accidental\". The fact that the period $q$ is necessarily even (unless $G$ is trivial in which case $q=1$) seems very mysterious to me. Of course, this is the key property for the exercise I'm doing (defining a generalization of the Herbrand quotient), so I would like to have a firm grasp of why it's true. I can more or less follow the reasoning in Cartan + Eilenberg for why this is true, but it's just a proof by contradiction by making a computation using the cup product, and using the fact that $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ has periodic cohomology with even period. Furthermore, I again am not seeing why cup-producting with an element of $\\widehat{H}{}^q(G,\\mathbb{Z})$ is necessarily involved. So, are there any more intuitive explanations of why group cohomology, if it is periodic, has even period? Are there any references other than Cartan + Eilenberg I can look at for this fact?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As stated, neither 1 nor 2 is true. For example, (for $p>2$) $H^{\\bullet}(\\mathbb F_p;\\mathbb F_p)=\\mathbb F_p[\\varepsilon,t]/\\varepsilon^2$ ($\\deg\\varepsilon=1$, $\\deg t=2$) — so (corresponding Tate) cohomology are 1-periodic, but this periodicity is not given by cup-product (of course, these groups are also 2-periodic, and 2-periodicity is given by cup-product). P.S. One actually needn't compute ring structure in $H^{\\bullet}(\\mathbb F_p;\\mathbb F_p)$ to show that the periodicity is not given by cup-product: indeed, it can't be given by an element of $H(G;\\mathbb Z)$ because $H^1(\\mathbb F_p;\\mathbb Z)=0$; it can't be even given by cup-product with an element of $H^1(\\mathbb F_p;\\mathbb F_p)$ — because (by supercommutativity) square of such element must have order 2 and there are no such elements in $H^2$ (which is not very surprising for a vector space over a field of $char\\ne2$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem following the user's example. The original question is about finite groups with periodic cohomology, specifically focusing on two main points: why the period must be even and why the isomorphisms between cohomology groups are given by cup product with a fixed element.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentions a finite group G with periodic cohomology. The periodicity is given by an isomorphism between the nth cohomology group and the (n+q)th one for all n, using the cup product with an element g in H^q. The problem here is to understand why q must be even and why the isomorphisms are necessarily via cup product.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. G has periodic cohomology, i.e., there exists q in natural numbers such that for all integers n, the Tate cohomology groups satisfy H^n(G, A) ≅ H^{n+q}(G, A) for all modules A.\n3. The isomorphisms in assumption 2 are induced by cup product with a fixed element g in H^q(G, Z).\n\nWait, but the user is questioning whether the isomorphisms must come from cup product. So maybe the assumption isn't that they are, but rather the problem is to show that they must be. Hmm. The example given in the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem but not explicitly stated. So perhaps here, the assumptions are the given conditions, not including what needs to be proven.\n\nSo, the problem is in two parts:\n\n1. Prove that if a finite group G has periodic cohomology with period q, then q is even (unless G is trivial).\n2. Show that the isomorphisms H^n ≅ H^{n+q} must be given by cup product with a fixed element g in H^q(G, Z).\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"how do we know that...\" and \"why it's true...\". So the problem statement would be to prove these two points under the assumptions given.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a finite group.\n- G has periodic cohomology, i.e., there exists q ∈ ℕ such that for all n ∈ ℤ and all modules A, there is an isomorphism Ĥ^n(G, A) ≅ Ĥ^{n+q}(G, A).\n- The cohomology isomorphisms are induced by cup product with a fixed element g ∈ Ĥ^q(G, ℤ).\n\nWait, but the user is questioning whether the isomorphisms must be induced by cup product. So perhaps in the assumptions, that part isn't included. The problem is to show that the isomorphisms must come from cup product, given that the cohomology is periodic. So maybe the assumptions are just that G is finite and has periodic cohomology, and the problem is to show that the period is even and that the isomorphisms are via cup product.\n\nSo, the user is assuming G has periodic cohomology (as per the chapter in Cartan-Eilenberg) and wants to know why q must be even and why the isomorphisms come from cup product. Therefore, the problem is to prove these two facts under the assumption that G is a finite group with periodic cohomology.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nG has periodic cohomology (i.e., there exists q ∈ ℕ such that Ĥ^n(G, A) ≅ Ĥ^{n+q}(G, A) for all n ∈ ℤ and all modules A).\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. The period q must be even if G is non-trivial.\n2. The isomorphisms are induced by cup product with a fixed element g ∈ Ĥ^q(G, ℤ).\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property. So splitting the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nThere exists a natural number q such that for all integers n and all G-modules A, Ĥ^n(G, A) is isomorphic to Ĥ^{n+q}(G, A).\n\nProblem:\nProve that q is even if G is non-trivial,\nProve that the isomorphisms are induced by cup product with a fixed element g ∈ Ĥ^q(G, ℤ).\n\nBut the problem should be phrased as a single problem statement. The user's example had the problem as a single statement. However, here, the original question has two parts. So perhaps the problem is structured as two separate problems, but the user wants it in one. Alternatively, since the user's example had the problem as a single statement, maybe this should also be a single problem with two parts.\n\nBut the formatting example shows that \"Problem:\" is followed by the problem statement. So perhaps combining both parts into one problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants each question as a separate problem, but given the original post is a single question with two parts, we need to structure it accordingly.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nG has periodic cohomology: there exists q ∈ ℕ such that for all integers n and all G-modules A, the Tate cohomology groups satisfy Ĥ^n(G, A) ≅ Ĥ^{n+q}(G, A).\n\nProblem:\n1. Prove that if G is non-trivial, then the period q must be even.\n2. Show that the isomorphisms are necessarily induced by cup product with a fixed element g ∈ Ĥ^q(G, ℤ).\n\nBut the example in the user's instruction had the problem as a single statement. Maybe we need to present the problem as two separate points under one problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem is from the user's perspective, asking two questions, but the formatting requires a single problem statement. Maybe rephrase the problem as:\n\nProve that for a finite group G with periodic cohomology of period q, the following hold:\n- The period q is even if G is non-trivial.\n- The periodicity isomorphisms are induced by cup product with a fixed element in Ĥ^q(G, ℤ).\n\nTherefore, combining both parts into one problem statement.\n\nChecking the example again: the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem listed those assumptions and the problem as to prove divisibility by 91. So here, the problem would be the two statements about q being even and the isomorphisms being via cup product.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nG is a finite group,\nThere exists a natural number q such that for all integers n and all G-modules A, the Tate cohomology groups satisfy Ĥ^n(G, A) ≅ Ĥ^{n+q}(G, A).\nProblem:\nProve that if G is non-trivial, then the period q is even, and the isomorphisms are induced by cup product with a fixed element g ∈ Ĥ^q(G, ℤ).\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
