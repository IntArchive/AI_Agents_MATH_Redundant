    "AcceptedAnswer": "I assume you are talking about complex $n\\times n$ matrices. This is not true in general within real square matrices. A simple proof goes by functional calculus. If $A$ is invertible, you can find a determination of the complex logarithm on some $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus e^{i\\theta_0}[0,+\\infty)$ which contains the spectrum of $A$. Then by holomorphic functional calculus , you can define $B:=\\log A$ and it satisfies $e^B=A$. Notes: 1) There is a formula that says $\\det e^B=e^{\\mbox{trace}\\;B}$ (easy proof by Jordan normal form, or by density of diagonalizable matrices). Therefore the range of the exponential over $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ is exactly $GL_n(\\mathbb{C})$, the group of invertible matrices. 2) For diagonalizable matrices $A$, it is very easy to find a log. Take $P$ invertible such that $A=PDP^{-1}$ with $D=\\mbox{diag}\\{\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n\\}$. If $A$ is invertible, then every $\\lambda_j$ is nonzero so we can find $\\mu_j$ such that $\\lambda_j=e^{\\mu_j}$. Then the matrix $B:=P\\mbox{diag}\\{\\mu_1,\\ldots,\\mu_n\\}P^{-1}$ satisfies $e^B=A$. 3) If $\\|A-I_n\\|<1$, we can define explicitly a log with the power series of $\\log (1+z)$ by setting $\\log A:=\\log(I_n+(A-I_n))=\\sum_{k\\geq 1}(-1)^{k+1}(A-I_n)^k/k.$ 4) For a real matrix $B$, the formula above shows that $\\det e^B>0$. So the matrices with a nonpositive determinant don't have a log. The converse is not true in general. A sufficient condition is that $A$ has no negative eigenvalue. For a necesary and sufficient condition, one needs to consider the Jordan decomposition of $A$. 5) And precisely, the Jordan decomposition of $A$ is a concrete way to get a log. Indeed, for a block $A=\\lambda I+N=\\lambda(I+\\lambda^{-1}N)$ with $\\lambda\\neq 0$ and $N$ nilpotent, take $\\mu$ such that $\\lambda=e^\\mu$ and set $B:=\\mu+\\log(I+\\lambda^{-1}N)=\\mu+\\sum_{k\\geq 1}(-1)^{k+1}\\lambda^{-k}N^k$ and note that this series has actually finitely many nonzero terms since $N$ is nilpotent. Do this on each block, and you get your log for the Jordan form of $A$. It only remains to go back to $A$ by similarity. 6) Finally, here are two examples using the above:\n$$\n\\log\\left( \\matrix{5&1&0\\\\0&5&1\\\\0&0&5}\\right)=\\left(\\matrix{\\log 5&1&-\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ 0&\\log 5&1\\\\0&0&\\log 5} \\right)\n$$\nand \n$$\n\\log\\left(\\matrix{-1&0\\\\0&1} \\right)=\\left(\\matrix{i\\pi&0\\\\0&0} \\right)\n$$\nare two possible choices for the log of these matrices.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that every invertible matrix can be written as the exponential of another matrix. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states \"every invertible matrix,\" so the main assumption is that the matrix is invertible. But I should check if there are any other implicit conditions. For example, are we dealing with real or complex matrices? The original question doesn't specify, so maybe that's an assumption missing. Wait, the user example didn't include field assumptions unless stated. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" The original problem had that, but in the example formatted problem, the assumptions listed were only the ones explicitly given. Wait, in the original example, the problem stated \"for every integer n,\" but in the formatted problem, the assumption listed was \"$n$ is an integer,\" and then the user added another assumption \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like the user might have made a mistake. Wait, no, maybe the original problem in the example had a mistake? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumptions are \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" But wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption that n is an integer is correct, but then why is there an additional assumption that n is divisible by 7? That seems contradictory. Unless maybe there was a typo in the original problem. Wait, perhaps the original problem was actually requiring n to be divisible by 7, but the user miswrote it? Or maybe in the example, the user made a mistake in structuring. Hmm. Anyway, perhaps the key is that in the formatted problem, the assumptions are all the given conditions. So if the problem says \"for every integer n,\" then the assumption is n is an integer. If the problem had a condition like \"n is divisible by 7,\" then that's another assumption.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is: \"Every invertible matrix can be written as the exponential of one other matrix.\" The user is asking for a proof of this claim. The original question mentions not being familiar with logarithms of matrices and wanting a proof without them. So the main assumption here is that the matrix is invertible. But in the context of matrix exponentials, there might be additional conditions. For example, over the complex field, every invertible matrix is the exponential of some complex matrix. But over the reals, this is not true. For instance, a real matrix with negative determinant cannot be expressed as the exponential of a real matrix, because the exponential of a real matrix has positive determinant. However, if the field isn't specified, the problem might be assuming complex matrices. But the original question doesn't mention the field. So perhaps the assumption is that the matrix is invertible and the underlying field is complex. But the original question doesn't state that. So maybe I need to check if the problem as posed on Math Stack Exchange includes any such information.\n\nLooking at the original question again: The title is \"Every invertible matrix can be written as the exponential of one other matrix.\" The question body says the user is looking for a proof of that claim, mentions logarithms, and wants a proof without them. The user doesn't specify the field. So in the absence of such information, maybe the standard assumption is that the matrices are over the complex numbers. However, the user might not know that. But according to the instructions, I need to structure the problem by listing all assumptions as per the given problem. If the original problem doesn't specify the field, then perhaps we can't assume it. But in reality, the statement is only true over algebraically closed fields like the complex numbers. So maybe the problem implicitly assumes complex matrices. But since the user doesn't mention it, should we include it as an assumption? The example given by the user included an assumption that was not in the original problem (n divisible by 7) but maybe that was part of the problem's hidden assumptions. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" which contradicts. That must have been a mistake in the example. So perhaps I should follow the user's example as presented, even if it's incorrect. Wait, but the user's example might have had a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumptions are \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" which would mean n is an integer, but the conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem actually required n to be divisible by both 7 and 13? Or maybe the user in their example made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo. Regardless, perhaps the key takeaway is that in the formatted problem, the assumptions are all the conditions given in the problem. So if the problem states \"for every integer n,\" then the assumption is that n is an integer, and if there's another condition like \"n divisible by 7,\" that's another assumption. So applying that to the current problem: the problem states \"every invertible matrix,\" so the assumption is that the matrix is invertible. But do we need to specify the field? If the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we shouldn't assume. But the answer might depend on the field. However, the problem as stated is a claim, so perhaps the standard assumption is complex matrices. Alternatively, maybe the problem is over real matrices, but then the statement is false. Therefore, there's a missing assumption here. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we need to proceed with the given information. The problem as stated is to prove that every invertible matrix can be written as the exponential of another matrix. If the field isn't specified, but the user is asking for a proof, perhaps the standard assumption is complex matrices, so we might need to include that as an assumption. But how?\n\nWait, the user's instructions say to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem. So perhaps if the original problem doesn't specify the field, but the answer depends on it, then we need to include that as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where the field is understood, like complex matrices. But since the problem is on Math Stack Exchange, and the user is asking for a proof, maybe the answer requires complex matrices. However, since the original problem doesn't mention the field, perhaps it's part of the assumptions. But how do I know? Maybe the answer is that over the complex field, every invertible matrix is the exponential of some matrix. So, perhaps the assumption is that the matrix is invertible and the entries are complex numbers. But the original problem doesn't state that. So perhaps the formatted problem's assumption is just \"the matrix is invertible.\" But that might be insufficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from linear algebra and assumes real matrices, but then the statement is false. So there's an ambiguity here. However, the user's example didn't include field assumptions unless stated. So perhaps we proceed with the given information. Therefore, the assumption is that the matrix is invertible. The problem is to prove that it can be written as the exponential of another matrix. But in reality, this is only true over certain fields, so maybe there's an implicit assumption here. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we just list \"the matrix is invertible\" as the assumption, and the problem as stated. However, this might lead to an incorrect problem statement, as over the reals, not every invertible matrix is an exponential. Therefore, perhaps the problem is implicitly about complex matrices. The original poster might be unaware of this nuance. So, to structure this correctly, maybe we need to include the field as an assumption. But since the original problem doesn't mention it, perhaps we can't. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as stated, and the user is referring to complex matrices. Given that the user is asking for a proof and mentions logarithms, maybe the context is complex matrices. Therefore, I should include the assumption that the matrix is invertible and that the entries are complex numbers. But how to phrase it. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is invertible,\nThe matrix has complex entries.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't mention complex entries. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of complex matrices, so that's an implicit assumption. But if the user is unaware, perhaps the answer would need to specify that. But according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the given example, filtering unrelated information. The original problem's title and question don't mention the field, so perhaps the assumption is just that the matrix is invertible, and the problem is as stated. However, this would be incorrect in general, but maybe the user is following a textbook where the field is assumed to be complex. Alternatively, perhaps the answer requires the field to be algebraically closed. Since the user wants a proof without using logarithms, maybe there's a different approach. But regardless, the task here is to structure the problem as per the user's example. Given that the example included assumptions that were explicit in the problem (n is an integer), even if there was a mistake, maybe in this case, the only assumption is that the matrix is invertible. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is invertible.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every invertible matrix can be written as the exponential of another matrix.\n\nBut that might be incomplete, as the statement is not true over the reals. However, given that the user hasn't specified the field, but the problem is posed as a general claim, maybe we need to proceed with that. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem on Math Stack Exchange has more context, like tags indicating linear algebra over complex numbers. But since we don't have that information, we have to go with what's given. Therefore, the safest assumption is that the matrix is invertible, and the problem is as stated. The answer would then require mentioning that this holds over the complex field, but since the user's task is to structure the problem, not to solve it, perhaps the assumptions are only what's given. So I think the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is invertible.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every invertible matrix can be written as the exponential of another matrix.\n\nBut to be precise, since over real numbers this isn't true, but the problem states it as a claim, it's possible that the intended field is complex. However, the problem as stated by the user doesn't mention that, so perhaps we shouldn't include it as an assumption unless it's explicitly stated. Therefore, the formatted problem would have only the invertible matrix as the assumption. The answer would then have to clarify the field, but the problem structure as per the user's example doesn't include implicit assumptions. Therefore, proceeding with the given information.",
