    "Content": "I know there are different definitions of Matrix Norm, but I want to use the definition on WolframMathWorld , and Wikipedia also gives a similar definition. The definition states as below: Given a square complex or real $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ , a matrix norm $\\|A\\|$ is a nonnegative number associated with $A$ having the properties 1. $\\|A\\|>0$ when $A\\neq0$ and $\\|A\\|=0$ iff $A=0$ , 2. $\\|kA\\|=|k|\\|A\\|$ for any scalar $k$ , 3. $\\|A+B\\|\\leq\\|A\\|+\\|B\\|$ , for $n \\times n$ matrix $B$ 4. $\\|AB\\|\\leq\\|A\\|\\|B\\|$ . Then, as the website states, we have $\\|A\\|\\geq|\\lambda|$ , here $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ . I don't know how to prove it, by using just these four properties.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $v$ is an eigenvector for $A$ corresponding to $\\lambda$. Form the \"eigenmatrix\" $B$ by putting $v$ in all the columns. Then $AB = \\lambda B$. So, by properties $2$ and $4$ (and $1$, to make sure $\\|B\\| > 0$),\n$$|\\lambda| \\|B\\| = \\|\\lambda B\\| = \\|AB\\| \\le \\|A\\| \\|B\\|.$$\nHence, $\\|A\\| \\ge |\\lambda|$ for all eigenvalues $\\lambda$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and identify all the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe question is about proving that the norm of a matrix is larger than its eigenvalue. The user mentions different definitions of matrix norms but specifically refers to the one on WolframMathWorld and Wikipedia. The definition includes four properties:\n\n1. The norm is positive if the matrix isn't zero, and zero only if the matrix is zero.\n2. Scalar multiplication property: norm of kA is |k| times norm of A.\n3. Triangle inequality: norm of A + B is ≤ norm of A + norm of B.\n4. Submultiplicativity: norm of AB is ≤ norm of A times norm of B.\n\nThe problem states that given these properties, we need to prove that the norm of A is at least the absolute value of any eigenvalue λ of A.\n\nNow, I need to list each assumption line by line, making sure each addresses one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the properties:\n\n- The matrix A is square (since it's n×n and they mention eigenvalues, which require square matrices).\n- The norm is a function with the four given properties.\n- The eigenvalue λ is of matrix A.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify any particular conditions on A except that it's square (complex or real). The assumptions are about the norm's properties and that λ is an eigenvalue of A. So each property of the norm should be listed as separate assumptions. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variables (like n being an integer). Here, the assumptions are about the norm's properties and the matrix A.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Given a square complex or real n×n matrix A, a matrix norm ||A|| is a nonnegative number associated with A having the properties 1. ... 4. ... Then, we have ||A|| ≥ |λ| for any eigenvalue λ of A.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square complex or real n×n matrix.\n- ||A|| is a matrix norm satisfying the four properties listed.\n- λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The four properties of the norm are part of the definition of the norm, so they can be considered as the norm's properties, but in the example given, the assumptions were listed as conditions on the variables. However, here, the key assumptions are that A is a square matrix, the norm satisfies those four properties, and λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n\nSo, translating this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a square complex or real n×n matrix.\n- The matrix norm ||A|| satisfies ||A|| > 0 if A ≠ 0 and ||A|| = 0 iff A = 0.\n- The matrix norm ||A|| satisfies ||kA|| = |k| ||A|| for any scalar k.\n- The matrix norm ||A|| satisfies ||A + B|| ≤ ||A|| + ||B|| for any n×n matrix B.\n- The matrix norm ||A|| satisfies ||AB|| ≤ ||A|| ||B|| for any n×n matrix B.\n- λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n\nProblem: Prove that ||A|| ≥ |λ|.\n\nBut the example provided had only two assumptions, each as separate lines. Wait, the example given was:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn that case, each assumption is a separate condition. So here, the properties of the norm are part of the definition, so perhaps each property is a separate assumption. But the problem states \"using just these four properties\", so maybe each property is considered an assumption for the proof. However, the user's example treated assumptions as given conditions on the variables. So perhaps in this case, the main assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square complex or real matrix.\n- The norm satisfies the four properties (but each property is a separate line).\n- λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that the norm is at least the eigenvalue's absolute value. So the key assumptions are the four norm properties and that λ is an eigenvalue. So, structuring each norm property as a separate assumption line, but that might be too detailed. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about the matrix, the norm's properties, and the eigenvalue. But the norm's properties are part of the definition, so perhaps the main assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square complex or real n×n matrix.\n- ||·|| is a matrix norm satisfying the four given axioms.\n- λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n\nBut the user's example broke down the assumptions into separate lines. For instance, if there are multiple conditions on different objects, each gets a line. So here, the norm's four properties are part of the norm's definition, but maybe each property is listed as a separate assumption. Alternatively, since they are all part of the definition of a matrix norm, perhaps the assumption is that ||·|| is a matrix norm (with those properties), and the other conditions (A is square, λ is eigenvalue). \n\nWait, the original problem states \"Given a square complex or real n×n matrix A, a matrix norm ||A|| is a nonnegative number associated with A having the properties 1. ... 4. ... Then, we have ||A|| ≥ |λ|, here λ is an eigenvalue of A.\"\n\nSo the problem assumes that we have a matrix A which is square, the norm has those four properties, and λ is an eigenvalue of A. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is a square complex or real n×n matrix.\n- The matrix norm ||·|| satisfies the four properties (1 to 4).\n- λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n\nBut to follow the example's style, where each assumption is a separate line addressing one property. However, the four norm properties are multiple. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Similarly, here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square complex or real n×n matrix,\nThe matrix norm ||A|| satisfies ||A|| > 0 when A ≠ 0 and ||A|| = 0 iff A = 0,\nThe matrix norm ||A|| satisfies ||kA|| = |k| ||A|| for any scalar k,\nThe matrix norm ||A|| satisfies ||A + B|| ≤ ||A|| + ||B|| for any n×n matrix B,\nThe matrix norm ||A|| satisfies ||AB|| ≤ ||A|| ||B|| for any n×n matrix B,\nλ is an eigenvalue of A.\n\nProblem: Prove that ||A|| ≥ |λ|.\n\nBut this might be too verbose, but the example had each condition as a separate line. Since the problem states that the norm has these four properties, each property is an assumption. Therefore, each of the four norm properties should be listed as separate assumptions, plus the matrix being square and λ being an eigenvalue.\n\nSo the final answer should list each of the four norm properties as separate assumptions, each on its own line, along with the matrix being square and λ being an eigenvalue. That way, each line addresses one property or condition applied to one object.",
