    "Content": "Prove that if $4^m-2^m+1$ is a prime number, then all the prime divisors of $m$ are smaller than $5$ I initially thought about putting $4^m-2^m+1=p$ where $p$ is some prime and after eliminating initial cases of $p<5$ , setting $p=6k \\pm 1$ . However, since I'm just a beginner in Number Theory,  I couldn't figure out anything else. What is more surprising that my teacher gave this problem in an Algebra worksheet, so perhaps there is some good algebraic way to do this. So, thinking on Algebraic lines, I made a substitution $2^m=x$ and did some manipulations to the quadratic thus made. However, still no luck (despite the fact that I'm pretty confident about my Algebraic skills) I look forward for some help with this one. Any (or both) method will do. Thanks in advance!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is asking to prove that if \\(4^m - 2^m + 1\\) is a prime number, then all prime divisors of \\(m\\) are smaller than 5. \n\nFirst, I need to list out the assumptions. The problem states that \\(4^m - 2^m + 1\\) is prime. That's one assumption. Then, there's the conclusion about the prime divisors of \\(m\\). But wait, are there any other implicit assumptions here? The variable \\(m\\) is probably a positive integer since we're talking about prime divisors. So maybe I should include that as an assumption. Let me check the example provided. In the example, the assumption was that \\(n\\) is an integer. So here, similarly, \\(m\\) should be an integer, perhaps positive.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- \\(4^m - 2^m + 1\\) is a prime number.\n- \\(m\\) is a positive integer (since prime divisors apply to integers greater than 1, but maybe the problem allows m=1? Though m=1 would have no prime divisors, but the conclusion would still hold vacuously. Hmm, but the original problem doesn't specify, so maybe we just take m as a positive integer. The user didn't state any restriction, but to be safe, maybe list that m is a positive integer.)\n\nWait, the example only listed the assumptions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was n is an integer, and then the user added another assumption about divisibility by 7. But in this case, the original problem states \"if \\(4^m -2^m +1\\) is a prime number\", so the main assumption is that this expression is prime. The problem is about prime divisors of m, so m must be a positive integer greater than 1 (since prime divisors exist for m ≥ 2). Wait, but m=1 is allowed? If m=1, then \\(4 - 2 + 1 = 3\\), which is prime. Then m=1 has no prime divisors, so the conclusion holds. So m is a positive integer, and the problem wants to show that any prime divisor of m is less than 5. So the problem's assumption is that \\(4^m -2^m +1\\) is prime, and m is a positive integer (as per context). So the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\(4^m - 2^m + 1\\) is a prime number,\n\\(m\\) is a positive integer.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove that all prime divisors of \\(m\\) are smaller than 5.\n\nBut wait, the original question's problem statement says \"Prove that if \\(4^m -2^m +1\\) is a prime number, then all the prime divisors of \\(m\\) are smaller than 5\". So the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. The example included an assumption that the original problem had (n is integer) and another assumption (divisible by 7). But in this case, the problem is given as an implication: If \\(4^m -2^m +1\\) is prime, then prime divisors of m are less than 5. So the main assumption is the hypothesis of the implication, which is that \\(4^m -2^m +1\\) is prime. However, since m must be a positive integer (as primes are defined in positive integers), maybe that's another assumption. But in the example, they didn't explicitly state that n is a positive integer unless necessary. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was n is an integer. Here, the original problem is \"if 4^m -2^m +1 is a prime number\", which implies that m must be a positive integer (since primes are positive integers greater than 1, and exponents would make sense here for m being non-negative, but m=0 would give 1 -1 +1=1, which isn't prime. So m must be at least 1. Therefore, m is a positive integer. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption. So to structure the problem, we need to list all assumptions. The user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. In this problem, the assumptions would be that m is a positive integer, and that 4^m -2^m +1 is prime. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\(4^m - 2^m + 1\\) is a prime number,\n\\(m\\) is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that all prime divisors of \\(m\\) are smaller than 5.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the user structured the problem as:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So maybe in that example, there was a mistake? Wait, maybe the original problem actually had the divisibility by 7 as part of the problem? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Maybe there was an error in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem is under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, perhaps modifying the problem. But that's unclear. However, given that example, perhaps in our current problem, the assumptions are only the ones given in the problem statement, even if some are implicit.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user says \"Prove that if 4^m -2^m +1 is a prime number, then all the prime divisors of m are smaller than 5\". So the only explicit assumption is that 4^m -2^m +1 is prime. But m must be a positive integer (since prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1). So the problem assumes m is a positive integer. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we need to list both:\n\nAssumption:\n\\(4^m - 2^m + 1\\) is a prime number,\n\\(m\\) is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that all prime divisors of \\(m\\) are smaller than 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"m is an integer\" is sufficient, but since prime divisors apply to positive integers, m must be a positive integer. So the two assumptions are necessary. Let me confirm. If m were a negative integer, 4^m would not be an integer, so the expression 4^m -2^m +1 wouldn't be an integer prime. Hence, m must be a positive integer. So the assumption that m is a positive integer is implicit in the problem statement. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, these two assumptions are necessary. So I think that's the correct formatting here.",
