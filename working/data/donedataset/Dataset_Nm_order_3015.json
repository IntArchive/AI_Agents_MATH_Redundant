    "Content": "I need some help with this problem: Let $f\\colon D \\to D$ analytic and $f(z_1)=0, f(z_2)=0, \\ldots, f(z_n)=0$ where $z_1, z_2, \\ldots, z_n \\in D= \\{z:|z|<1\\}$. I want to show that $$|f(z)|\n \\leq \\prod_{k=1}^n \\left| \\frac{z-z_k}{1-\\overline{z_k}\\, z} \\right|$$ for all $z \\in\n D$. It seems that I need to use Schwarz-Pick Lemma but it seems that the problem doesn't satisfy the conditions. Another lemma that I can use is that of Lindelöf saying: Let $f:D \\to D$ analytic, then $$|f(z)|\\leq \\frac{|f(0)|+|z|}{1+|f(0)| \\cdot |z|}$$ for all $  z \\in D$. It seems to be an easy problem but I couldn't succeed in solving it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the problem is to show that for an analytic function f mapping the unit disk D to itself, with zeros at points z₁, z₂, ..., zₙ in D, the inequality |f(z)| ≤ product from k=1 to n of |(z - z_k)/(1 - conjugate(z_k) z)| holds for all z in D. \n\nFirst, I recall that when dealing with bounded analytic functions on the unit disk, especially those that map the disk to itself, the Schwarz-Pick lemma is often useful. The Schwarz-Pick lemma states that if f: D → D is analytic, then for any z in D, |f'(z)| ≤ (1 - |f(z)|²)/(1 - |z|²), and if there's a point where equality holds, then f is a Blaschke product of degree 1, i.e., a Möbius transformation. But the problem here has multiple zeros, so maybe a Blaschke product with multiple factors?\n\nWait, the Blaschke product is a function of the form B(z) = product_{k=1}^n ( (z - z_k)/(1 - conjugate(z_k) z) ) multiplied by a constant of modulus 1. Since the function f in the problem has zeros exactly at z₁,...,zₙ, perhaps we can consider dividing f by this Blaschke product. Because the Blaschke product has the same zeros as f, each with the same multiplicity, then f(z)/B(z) would be analytic and non-vanishing in D. Moreover, since |B(z)| = 1 on the boundary of the disk (when |z|=1), by the maximum modulus principle, |B(z)| ≤ 1 in D. Wait, actually, each factor in the Blaschke product maps D to D, and the product would also map D to D. So if f has zeros at z_k, then f(z)/B(z) is analytic in D with no zeros, and |f(z)/B(z)| ≤ 1 on the boundary, so by maximum modulus, |f(z)/B(z)| ≤ 1 in D. Hence |f(z)| ≤ |B(z)|, which is exactly the inequality we need to prove. \n\nBut wait, the problem states to use Schwarz-Pick or Lindelöf's lemma. Maybe the user is not familiar with Blaschke products? Let me check the original question again. The user mentions they tried using Schwarz-Pick but the problem didn't satisfy the conditions. Maybe they thought Schwarz-Pick requires injectivity or something else. But Schwarz-Pick applies to any analytic self-map of the disk, regardless of zeros. However, the standard Schwarz-Pick gives a bound on the derivative, but here we need a bound on the function itself in terms of its zeros.\n\nAlternatively, Lindelöf's lemma is mentioned, which gives a bound |f(z)| ≤ (|f(0)| + |z|)/(1 + |f(0)| |z|). But how to connect that with the zeros? Maybe inductively applying the lemma for each zero?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the case when there's a single zero z₁. Then, if f(z₁) = 0, then by the Schwarz lemma, we can write f(z) = ( (z - z₁)/(1 - conjugate(z₁) z) ) * g(z), where g is analytic and maps D to D. Then |f(z)| = |(z - z₁)/(1 - conjugate(z₁) z)| |g(z)| ≤ |(z - z₁)/(1 - conjugate(z₁) z)|, since |g(z)| ≤ 1. So in the case of one zero, the inequality holds. For multiple zeros, maybe we can iterate this process. Each time you have a zero, factor out the corresponding Blaschke factor, and the remaining function still maps D to D. Hence, by induction, after factoring out all n zeros, the remaining function g(z) has no zeros and |g(z)| ≤ 1, so |f(z)| ≤ product of |(z - z_k)/(1 - conjugate(z_k) z)|. \n\nTherefore, the key idea is that dividing f by the Blaschke product with zeros at z_k gives a function without zeros, which by maximum modulus has absolute value ≤1. Hence the inequality follows. \n\nBut the problem is presented as something that might need Schwarz-Pick or Lindelöf. If the user isn't aware of Blaschke products, maybe they need to approach it via Schwarz-Pick. Let me see: For each zero z_k, consider the Möbius transformation phi_k(z) = (z - z_k)/(1 - conjugate(z_k) z), which maps D to D, sending z_k to 0. Then f(z) can be written as product_{k=1}^n phi_k(z) * g(z), where g is analytic and maps D to D without zeros. Then |g(z)| ≤1, hence |f(z)| ≤ product |phi_k(z)|. That would be the approach. So the key assumption is that f is analytic from D to D with zeros at z₁,...,zₙ. Then the inequality follows from factoring out the Blaschke product and noting the remaining function is bounded by 1. \n\nThe assumptions would then be: f is analytic on D, f maps D to D, f has zeros at z₁,...,zₙ in D. Each of these is a separate condition. The problem is to show the inequality involving the product of the Blaschke factors.",
