    "Content": "How could we prove that $$\\lim_{x\\to1^-}~\\bigg(\\sqrt[a]{1-x}\\cdot\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty~x^{n^a}\\bigg)~=~\\Gamma\\bigg(1+\\frac1a\\bigg)$$ for $a>0$ ? The inspiration came to me while trying find a solution to this related question , which treats the special case $a=2$. I am pretty confident that the best way to approach this is by some clever manipulation of the well-known identities $~\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty e^{-t^a}~dt~=~\\Gamma\\bigg(1+\\frac1a\\bigg)~$ and $~e^u~=~\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{u^n}{n!}~,$ but unfortunately I haven't been able thus far to capitalize on my own idea. I also tried writing x as $1-\\epsilon$, and then expanding $(1-\\epsilon)^{n^a}$ into its binomial series, but this endeavor has also been proven worthless, or, at the very least, it appears to be so in my hands. Which is where you, dear reader, come in! Can you help me out of my impasse ? Any ideas or suggestions are welcome!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original problem is about proving a limit involving a sum and a Gamma function. The user mentioned the limit as x approaches 1 from the left of the product of the a-th root of (1-x) and the sum of x raised to n^a, and that this equals Gamma(1 + 1/a) for a > 0. \n\nSo, the main elements here are:\n- The limit as x approaches 1 from the left.\n- The expression involves sqrt[a]{1-x} (which is (1-x)^(1/a)) multiplied by a sum from n=0 to infinity of x^{n^a}.\n- The result should be Gamma(1 + 1/a).\n- The parameter a is positive.\n\nNow, the assumptions. The problem states that a > 0. Also, the limit is one-sided (x approaching 1 from below). The sum is an infinite series, which presumably converges for x in [0,1). The user is trying to relate this to the integral of e^{-t^a} which connects to the Gamma function. \n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nthe limit is taken as x approaches 1 from the left,\nthe sum is over all non-negative integers n,\neach term in the sum is x raised to the power of n^a,\nthe expression involves the product of (1 - x)^{1/a} and the sum.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the expression is already given. The key assumptions here are the conditions on a, the direction of the limit, and the structure of the sum. The problem is to prove that this limit equals the Gamma function. \n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nthe limit is taken as x approaches 1 from below,\nthe sum is over all integers n ≥ 0,\neach term in the sum is x^{n^a},\nthe expression is the product of (1 - x)^{1/a} and the sum.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. The problem statement is the equation itself. The assumptions are the given conditions. So, the key assumptions are a > 0, x approaching 1 from the left, and the structure of the expression. The rest (like the sum being over n ≥ 0) is part of the problem's setup. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So, assumptions are the conditions given for the problem, not the structure of the expression. Therefore, in this case, the assumptions would be a > 0 and the limit direction. The rest is part of the problem's expression. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"for a > 0\". That's an assumption. The limit as x approaches 1 from the left (since it's 1^-). The sum is from n=0 to infinity, which is part of the problem's statement. So, the assumptions should be:\n\n- a is a positive real number.\n- The limit is taken as x approaches 1 from the left.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the product of (1 - x)^{1/a} and the sum of x^{n^a} from n=0 to infinity equals Gamma(1 + 1/a) in the limit.\n\nSo, formatted accordingly:\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nthe limit is taken as x approaches 1 from below.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{x\\to1^-}~\\left(\\sqrt[a]{1-x}\\cdot\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^{n^a}\\right)~=~\\Gamma\\left(1+\\frac{1}{a}\\right).$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. The sum structure is part of the problem, not an assumption. The key conditions are a > 0 and the direction of the limit.",
