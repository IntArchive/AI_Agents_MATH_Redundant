    "Content": "I was watching this Mathologer video ( https://youtu.be/YuIIjLr6vUA?t=1652 ) and he says at 27:32 First, suppose that our initial chunk is part of a parabola, or if you like a cubic, or any polynomial. If I then tell you that my mystery function is a polynomial, there's always going to be exactly one polynomial that continues our initial chunk . In other words, a polynomial is completely determined by any part of it. [...] Again, just relax if all this seems a little bit too much. So he didn't give a proof of the theorem in bold text – I think this is very important. I understand that there always exists a polynomial of degree $n$ that passes through a set of $n+1$ points (i.e. there are finitely many custom points to be passed by, the chunk has to be discrete, like $(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,5)$ ). But there also exists some polynomial of degree $m$ ( $m\\ne n$ ) that passes through the same set of points. But how do I prove that there exists one and only one polynomial that passes through a set of infinitely many points?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $p$ and $q$ are polynomials agreeing on infinitely many points, then $p-q$ is a polynomial that’s 0 on infinitely many points. But if a polynomial $f$ of degree $n$ is $0$ on more than $n$ points, then it’s zero everywhere.  (If it has zeroes $a_1, \\ldots a_n$ , then by repeated division it’s of the form $c(x-a_1)\\cdots(x-a_n)$ ; if it’s zero at some other point as well, then we get $c=0$ .) So a polynomial that’s 0 on infinitely many points is 0 everywhere.  So, going back to the beginning, if $p$ and $q$ are polynomials agreeing on infinitely many points, then $p-q$ is zero everywhere, i.e. $p=q$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is referring to a statement from a Mathologer video that a polynomial is completely determined by any part of it, implying that if you have a polynomial and you know its values on some \"chunk\" (which seems to be an interval with infinitely many points), then there's only one polynomial that can extend that chunk. The user is confused because they know that for finitely many points, you can have multiple polynomials of different degrees passing through them, but with infinitely many points, it's different.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions here. The main assumption is that the function in question is a polynomial. The problem is to prove that if two polynomials agree on an infinite set of points (like an interval), then they must be the same polynomial. That would mean there's only one polynomial that can pass through all those infinitely many points, hence being uniquely determined by any infinite part of it.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"any part of it,\" but in the context, the part has to be an interval or something with infinitely many points. So the key assumptions would be that the function is a polynomial and that the chunk (part) it's known on has infinitely many points. The user's example with discrete points (finite) allows multiple polynomials, but with infinitely many points, uniqueness follows.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The function is a polynomial.\n2. The function is known on an infinite set of points (e.g., an interval).\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists exactly one polynomial that agrees with the given values on an infinite set of points.\n\nBut wait, the original statement is that \"a polynomial is completely determined by any part of it,\" where the part could be any interval (infinitely many points). The confusion comes from finite vs. infinite points. So the problem is to show that two polynomials that agree on infinitely many points must be identical. Therefore, if you have a chunk (infinite points) of a polynomial, only that polynomial can extend it.\n\nSo the formatted problem should capture that. The assumptions would include that two polynomials agree on infinitely many points, perhaps specifying that the set of points has no limit point (but in the video, it's an interval, which in real numbers has limit points). Wait, actually, over the real numbers, any interval contains infinitely many points and is a perfect set (every point is a limit point). But in the problem, maybe the key is that if two polynomials agree on infinitely many points, they must be the same. But in general, over a field, two polynomials of degree at most n agreeing on more than n points are identical. So if they agree on infinitely many points, then they must be the same polynomial.\n\nSo the problem here is: Prove that if two polynomials agree on infinitely many points, then they are identical.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let p(x) and q(x) be polynomials.\n- There exists an infinite set of points where p(x) = q(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that p(x) and q(x) are identical polynomials (i.e., all their coefficients are equal).\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"there exists one and only one polynomial that passes through a set of infinitely many points.\" So uniqueness given infinitely many points.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is: Prove that if a polynomial passes through a set of infinitely many points, then it is uniquely determined by those points. So the assumption is that we have a set of infinitely many points (x_i, y_i) and there exists a polynomial p(x) passing through them. The problem is to show that this polynomial is unique.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, for finite points, you can have multiple polynomials (different degrees). But with infinitely many points, only one. So the key is that the polynomial is uniquely determined by infinitely many points.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- There exists a polynomial passing through an infinite set of points.\n- The set of points is infinite.\n\nProblem: Prove that this polynomial is unique.\n\nAlternatively, more formally: Let S be an infinite set of points in the plane such that there exists a polynomial p(x) passing through all points in S. Prove that p(x) is the only polynomial that passes through all points in S.\n\nBut the standard theorem is that two polynomials that agree on infinitely many points must be identical. So the problem can be phrased as: Prove that if two polynomials agree on infinitely many points, then they are the same polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions that p and q are polynomials and they agree on an infinite set of points, and the problem is to prove they are identical.\n\nSo, the user's original problem is to prove uniqueness when given infinitely many points, which reduces to showing that two such polynomials must coincide.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let p(x) and q(x) be polynomials.\n- There exists an infinite set of points {x_i} such that p(x_i) = q(x_i) for all i.\n\nProblem:\nProve that p(x) = q(x) for all x.\n\nThis captures the essence. The key assumptions are two polynomials agreeing on an infinite set of points, leading to the conclusion they are the same.",
