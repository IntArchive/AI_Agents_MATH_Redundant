    "Content": "Prove that if $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are nonzero orthogonal vectors in $\\Bbb R^n$ they are linearly Independent. I've struggled with this a bit, here is what I know so far: Suppose $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are orthogonal.  Then $\\mathbf{u\\cdot v}=0$\nand\n$c_1\\mathbf{u}+c_2\\mathbf{v}=0$ is linearly Independent iff $c_1=c_2=0$ I know I need to end with $c_1=c_2=0$ but I can't find a path that reaches this conclusion.  I feel like I need to use properties of the dot product to connect my first assumption to my second assumption but I'm lost on the way.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Then $c_1\\mathbf{u}+c_2\\mathbf{v}=0$ is linearly Independent iff $c_1=c_2=0$ This does not actually make sense: $c_1\\mathbf{u}+c_2\\mathbf{v}=0$ isn’t something that can be linearly independent. Linear independence is a property of sets of vectors; $c_1\\mathbf{u}+c_2\\mathbf{v}=0$ is an equation involving vectors, but it is not a set of vectors. The correct statement is that the set $\\{\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}\\}$ is linearly independent (or, more casually, that the vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are linearly independent) iff it has the following property: if $c_1$ and $c_2$ are scalars such that $c_1\\mathbf{u}+c_2\\mathbf{v}=0$, then $c_1=c_2=0$. Your problem, then, is to show that if $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are orthogonal, and if $c_1$ and $c_2$ are scalars such that $c_1\\mathbf{u}+c_2\\mathbf{v}=0$, then $c_1=c_2=0$. To do this, assume that $c_1$ and $c_2$ are scalars such that $c_1\\mathbf{u}+c_2\\mathbf{v}=0$. Now apply the hint that Ayman Hourieh gave in his answer to show that $c_1=0$ and $c_2=0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that if two nonzero vectors u and v in R^n are orthogonal, then they are linearly independent. \n\nFirst, I remember that linear independence means that the only solution to c1*u + c2*v = 0 is c1 = 0 and c2 = 0. The user mentioned they know that part. The vectors being orthogonal means their dot product u·v = 0. \n\nSo, starting with the equation c1*u + c2*v = 0. To show c1 and c2 must be zero. Maybe take the dot product of both sides with one of the vectors, say u. Then:\n\n(c1*u + c2*v) · u = 0 · u\n\nWhich simplifies to c1*(u·u) + c2*(v·u) = 0. But since u and v are orthogonal, v·u = 0. So this becomes c1*(u·u) = 0. Since u is nonzero, u·u is positive, so c1 must be 0. Similarly, take the dot product with v:\n\n(c1*u + c2*v) · v = 0 · v\n\nWhich gives c1*(u·v) + c2*(v·v) = 0. Again, u·v is 0, so c2*(v·v) = 0. Since v is nonzero, v·v is positive, so c2 = 0. Therefore, both c1 and c2 are zero, proving linear independence.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't mention any specific conditions other than u and v being nonzero and orthogonal. So the assumptions should list those properties. Each assumption should be one line, one condition per object. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each line is a single condition applied to one object. Here, the problem states u and v are nonzero vectors in R^n, they are orthogonal. So each of those would be separate assumptions. Let me structure that.\n\nAssumptions:\n- u and v are vectors in R^n,\n- u is a nonzero vector,\n- v is a nonzero vector,\n- u and v are orthogonal.\n\nProblem: Prove that u and v are linearly independent.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single condition applied to the respective objects. The key points are that they are vectors in R^n, both nonzero, and orthogonal. The problem is to show linear independence. The user's confusion was connecting the orthogonality to linear independence via the dot product. The solution involves using the dot product with each vector to isolate the coefficients.",
