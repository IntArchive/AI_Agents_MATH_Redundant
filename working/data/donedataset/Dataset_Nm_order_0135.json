    "Content": "I am having trouble seeing the difference between weak and strong induction. There are a few examples in which we can see the difference, such as reaching the $k^{th}$ rung of a ladder and proving every integer $>1$ can be written as a product of primes: To show every $n\\ge2$ can be written as a product of primes, first we note that $2$ is prime. Now we assume true for all integers $2 \\le m<n$ . If $n$ is prime, we're done. If $n$ is not prime, then it is composite and so $n=ab$ , where $a$ and $b$ are less than $n$ . Since $a$ and $b$ are less than $n$ , $ab$ can be written as a product of primes and hence $n$ can be written as a product of primes. QED However, it seems sort of like weak induction, only a bit dubious. In weak induction, we show a base case is true, then we assume true for all integers $k-1$ , (or $k$ ), then we attempt to show it is true for $k$ , (or $k+1$ ), which implies true $\\forall n \\in \\mathbb N$ . When we assume true for all integers $k$ , isn't that the same as a strong induction hypothesis? That is, we're assuming true for all integers up to some specific one. As a simple demonstrative example, how would we show $1+2+\\cdots+n= {n(n+1) \\over 2}$ using strong induction? (Learned from Discrete Mathematics by Kenneth Rosen)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Initial remarks: Good question. I think it deserves a full response (warning: this is going to be a long, but hopefully very clear, answer). First, most students do not really understand why mathematical induction is a valid proof technique . That's part of the problem. Second, weak induction and strong induction are actually logically equivalent; thus, differentiating between these forms of induction may seem a little bit difficult at first. The important thing to do is to understand how weak and strong induction are stated and to clearly understand the differences therein (I disagree with the previous answer that it is \"just a matter of semantics\"; it's not, and I will explain why). Much of what I will have to say is adapted from David Gunderson's wonderful book Handbook of Mathematical Induction , but I have expanded and tweaked a few things where I saw fit. That being said, hopefully you will find the rest of this answer to be informative. Gunderson remark about strong induction: While attempting an inductive proof, in the inductive step one often needs only the truth of $S(n)$ to prove $S(n+1)$; sometimes a little more \"power\" is needed (such as in the proof that any positive integer $n\\geq 2$ is a product of primes--we'll explore why more power is needed in a moment), and often this is made possible by strengthening the inductive hypothesis. Kenneth Rosen remark in Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications Study Guide : Understanding and constructing proofs by mathematical induction are extremely difficult tasks for most students. Do not be discouraged, and do not give up, because, without doubt, this proof technique is the most important one there is in mathematics and computer science. Pay careful attention to the conventions to be observed in writing down a proof by induction. As with all proofs, remember that a proof by mathematical induction is like an essay--it must have a beginning, a middle, and an end; it must consist of complete sentences, logically and aesthetically arranged; and it must convince the reader. Be sure that your basis step (also called the \"base case\") is correct (that you have verified the proposition in question for the smallest value or values of $n$), and be sure that your inductive step is correct and complete (that you have derived the proposition for $k+1$, assuming the inductive hypothesis that proposition is true for $k$--or the slightly strong hypothesis that it is true for all values less than or equal to $k$, when using strong induction. Statement of weak induction: Let $S(n)$ denote a statement regarding an integer $n$, and let $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ be fixed. If (i) $S(k)$ holds, and (ii) for every $m\\geq k, S(m)\\to S(m+1)$, then for every $n\\geq k$, the statement $S(n)$ holds. Statement of strong induction: Let $S(n)$ denote a statement regarding an integer $n$. If (i) $S(k)$ is true and (ii) for every $m\\geq k, [S(k)\\land S(k+1)\\land\\cdots\\land S(m)]\\to S(m+1)$, then for every $n\\geq k$, the statement $S(n)$ is true. Proof of strong induction from weak: Assume that for some $k$, the statement $S(k)$ is true and for every $m\\geq k, [S(k)\\land S(k+1)\\land\\cdot\\land S(m)]\\to S(m+1)$. Let $B$ be the set of all $n>m$ for which $S(n)$ is false. If $B\\neq\\varnothing, B\\subset\\mathbb{N}$ and so by well-ordering, $B$ has a least element, say $\\ell$. By the definition of $B$, for every $k\\leq t<\\ell, S(t)$ is true. The premise of the inductive hypothesis is true, and so $S(\\ell)$ is true, contradicting that $\\ell\\in B$. Hence $B=\\varnothing$. $\\blacksquare$ Proof of weak induction from strong: Assume that strong induction holds (in particular, for $k=1$). That is, assume that if $S(1)$ is true and for every $m\\geq 1, [S(1)\\land S(2)\\land\\cdots\\land S(m)]\\to S(m+1)$, then for every $n\\geq 1, S(n)$ is true. Observe (by truth tables, if desired), that for $m+1$ statements $p_i$,\n$$\n[p_1\\to p_2]\\land[p_2\\to p_3]\\land\\cdots\\land[p_m\\to p_{m+1}]\\Rightarrow[(p_1\\land p_2\\land\\cdots\\land p_m)\\to p_{m+1}],\\tag{$\\dagger$}\n$$\nitself a result provable by induction (see end of answer for such a proof). Assume that the hypotheses of weak induction are true, that is, that $S(1)$ is true, and that for arbitrary $t, S(t)\\to S(t+1)$. By repeated application of these recent assumptions, $S(1)\\to S(2), S(2)\\to S(3),\\ldots, S(m)\\to S(m+1)$ each hold. By the above observation, then\n$$\n[S(1)\\land S(2)\\land\\cdots\\land S(m)]\\to S(m+1).\n$$\nThus the hypotheses of strong induction are complete, and so one concludes that for every $n\\geq 1$, the statement $S(n)$ is true, the consequence desired to complete the proof of weak induction. $\\blacksquare$ Proving any positive integer $n\\geq 2$ is a product of primes using strong induction: Let $S(n)$ be the statement \"$n$ is a product of primes.\" Base step ($n=2$): Since $n=2$ is trivially a product of primes (actually one prime, really), $S(2)$ is true. Inductive step: Fix some $m\\geq 2$, and assume that for every $t$ satisfying $2\\leq t\\leq m$, the statement $S(t)$ is true. To be shown is that\n$$\nS(m+1) : m+1 \\text{ is a product of primes},\n$$\nis true. If $m+1$ is a prime, then $S(m+1)$ is true. If $m+1$ is not prime, then there exist $r$ and $s$ with $2\\leq r\\leq m$ and $2\\leq s\\leq m$ so that $m+1=rs$. Since $S(r)$ is assumed to be true, $r$ is a product of primes [ note: This is where it is imperative that we use strong induction; using weak induction, we cannot assume $S(r)$ is true]; similarly, by $S(s), s$ is a product of primes. Hence $m+1=rs$ is a product of primes, and so $S(m+1)$ holds. Thus, in either case, $S(m+1)$ holds, completing the inductive step. By mathematical induction, for all $n\\geq 2$, the statement $S(n)$ is true. $\\blacksquare$ Proof of $1+2+3+\\cdots+n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ by strong induction: Using strong induction here is completely unnecessary, for you do not need it at all, and it is only likely to confuse people as to why you are using it. It will proceed just like a proof by weak induction, but the assumption at the outset will look different; nonetheless, just to show what I am talking about, I will prove it using strong induction. Let $S(n)$ denote the proposition\n$$\nS(n) : 1+2+3+\\cdots+n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.\n$$ Base step ($n=1$): $S(1)$ is true because $1=\\frac{1(1+1)}{2}$. Inductive step: Fix some $k\\geq 1$, and assume that for every $t$ satisfying $1\\leq t\\leq k$, the statement $S(t)$ is true. To be shown is that\n$$\nS(k+1) : 1+2+3+\\cdots+k+(k+1)=\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\n$$\nfollows. Beginning with the left-hand side of $S(k+1)$,\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{LHS} \n&= 1+2+3+\\cdots+k+(k+1)\\tag{by definition}\\\\[1em]\n&= (1+2+3+\\cdots+k)+(k+1)\\tag{group terms}\\\\[1em]\n&= \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}+(k+1)\\tag{by $S(k)$}\\\\[1em]\n&= (k+1)\\left(\\frac{k}{2}+1\\right)\\tag{factor out $k+1$}\\\\[1em]\n&= (k+1)\\left(\\frac{k+2}{2}\\right)\\tag{common denominator}\\\\[1em]\n&= \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\\tag{desired expression}\\\\[1em]\n&= \\text{RHS},\n\\end{align}\nwe obtain the right-hand side of $S(k+1)$. By mathematical induction, for all $n\\geq 1$, the statement $S(n)$ is true. $\\blacksquare$ $\\color{red}{\\text{Comment:}}$ See how this was really no different than how a proof by weak induction would work? The only thing different is really an unnecessary assumption made at the beginning of the proof. However, in your prime number proof, strong induction is essential; otherwise, we cannot assume $S(r)$ or $S(s)$ to be true. Here, any assumption regarding $t$ where $1\\leq t\\leq k$ is really useless because we don't actually use it anywhere in the proof, whereas we did use the assumptions $S(r)$ and $S(s)$ in the prime number proof, where $1\\leq t\\leq m$, because $r,s < m$. Does it now make sense why it was necessary to use strong induction in the prime number proof? Proof of $(\\dagger)$ by induction: For statements $p_1,\\ldots,p_{m+1}$, we have that\n$$\n[p_1\\to p_2]\\land[p_2\\to p_3]\\land\\cdots\\land[p_m\\to p_{m+1}]\\Rightarrow[(p_1\\land p_2\\land\\cdots\\land p_m)\\to p_{m+1}].\n$$ Proof. For each $m\\in\\mathbb{Z^+}$, let $S(m)$ be the statement that for $m+1$ statements $p_i$,\n$$\nS(m) : [p_1\\to p_2]\\land[p_2\\to p_3]\\land\\cdots\\land[p_m\\to p_{m+1}]\\Rightarrow[(p_1\\land p_2\\land\\cdots\\land p_m)\\to p_{m+1}].\n$$ Base step: The statement $S(1)$ says\n$$\n[p_1\\to p_2]\\Rightarrow [(p_1\\land p_2)\\to p_2],\n$$\nwhich is true (since the right side is a tautology). Inductive step: Fix $k\\geq 1$, and assume that for any statements $q_1,\\ldots,q_{k+1}$, both\n$$\nS(1) : [q_1\\to q_2]\\Rightarrow [(q_1\\land q_2)\\to q_2]\n$$\nand\n$$\nS(k) : [q_1\\to q_2]\\land[q_2\\to q_3]\\land\\cdots\\land[q_k\\to q_{k+1}]\\Rightarrow[(q_1\\land q_2\\land\\cdots\\land q_k)\\to q_{k+1}].\n$$\nhold. It remains to show that for any statements $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k,p_{k+1},p_{k+2}$ that\n$$\nS(k+1) : [p_1\\to p_2]\\land[p_2\\to p_3]\\land\\cdots\\land[p_{k+1}\\to p_{k+2}]\\Rightarrow[(p_1\\land p_2\\land\\cdots\\land p_{k+1})\\to p_{k+2}]\n$$\nfollows.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about the difference between weak and strong induction. The example provided in the question uses the proof that every integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes. The user also mentions trying to apply strong induction to the sum of the first n natural numbers formula.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The problem here isn't to prove something specific but to explain the difference between weak and strong induction, using the examples provided. However, in the example given by the user (the primes product proof), they might be asking how that proof uses strong induction versus weak, and perhaps how to apply strong induction to another example like the sum formula.\n\nWait, the actual problem stated in the question is \"What exactly is the difference between weak and strong induction?\" and then the user provides two examples: the ladder rung and the prime product proof. The user is confused because in the prime product proof, they assume true for all integers from 2 up to n-1, which seems like strong induction, but the user thought it might be similar to weak induction. Then, the user asks how to show the sum formula using strong induction as an example.\n\nSo, when structuring this, the problem is to clarify the difference between weak and strong induction, particularly through the examples given. But the specific task is to format the problem as per the given structure. The original problem in the question is the user's request to understand the difference, with the examples provided.\n\nBut in the user's example (the A(n) divisible by 91), they extracted assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more about structuring the question's content into the Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nLooking at the user's question on Math Stack Exchange, the main problem is: \"What exactly is the difference between weak and strong induction?\" with specific examples. The user also asks how to apply strong induction to the sum formula example.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format. The Assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the primes example, the assumptions would be that n is an integer greater than 1, and the problem is to prove that n can be written as a product of primes using strong induction. However, in the original question, the user is not asking to prove that, but to explain the difference between induction types.\n\nWait, maybe the problem here is to take the specific example the user mentioned (proving the sum 1+2+...+n = n(n+1)/2 using strong induction) and structure that as the Problem part, with the necessary assumptions.\n\nLooking back at the example given by the user, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the current case, the problem the user is working on is to show the sum formula using strong induction. Therefore, the assumptions would be about n being a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the formula using strong induction.\n\nBut in the original Stack Exchange question, the user's main problem is about understanding the difference between weak and strong induction, with the examples provided. However, the task here is to structure the problem as per the given format. The example given by the user (the A(n) problem) shows that the formatted problem includes the specific mathematical statement and the assumptions.\n\nBut in the current case, the user's question isn't a single mathematical problem to prove something, but a conceptual question about induction types. However, the user does provide specific examples, so maybe the task is to structure one of those examples into the format. For instance, the prime factorization example or the sum formula example.\n\nLooking at the user's instruction again: they want the assistant to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated information, and structure it into Assumptions and Problem. The example given was a problem to prove a divisibility property, with assumptions on n.\n\nIn the current case, the Stack Exchange question includes two examples: the prime factorization and the sum formula. The user is asking how to apply strong induction to the sum formula. So perhaps the formatted problem would be to prove the sum formula using strong induction, with assumptions about n being a positive integer.\n\nWait, but the original question is more about the difference between weak and strong induction. However, the user's instruction is to structure the problem as per the example. The example took a specific problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) and listed assumptions. So here, perhaps the problem to structure is the one the user is asking about: proving the sum formula using strong induction, with the assumption that n is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the Assumptions would be that n is a positive integer, and the Problem is to prove that 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 using strong induction.\n\nAlternatively, if the main problem is the prime factorization example, then assumptions would be n is an integer greater than 1, and the problem is to prove n can be written as a product of primes using strong induction. But since the user specifically asks about the sum formula example in the question, that might be the focus.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$1 + 2 + \\cdots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ using strong induction.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any other assumptions in the problem. In the sum formula, typically induction starts at n=1. The base case would be n=1. In strong induction, the inductive step assumes the statement is true for all previous cases. So the assumptions here are that n is a positive integer, and possibly that the formula holds for all positive integers up to n-1. However, in the problem statement, the assumptions should be the given conditions, not the inductive hypothesis.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user (the A(n) problem), the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Those are the given conditions, not the inductive hypothesis. Similarly, here, the problem is to prove the sum formula for any positive integer n using strong induction. So the assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$1 + 2 + \\cdots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ using strong induction.\n\nThis matches the structure of the example, where the assumption is about n's properties, and the problem is to prove the statement.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's question is about the prime factorization example, then:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every integer n ≥ 2 can be written as a product of primes using strong induction.\n\nBut the user's question includes both examples. However, the specific problem they ask at the end is about the sum formula. Therefore, structuring that as the Problem part.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. The user wants to see how strong induction is applied to the sum formula example, so structuring that as the problem with the assumption that n is a positive integer.",
