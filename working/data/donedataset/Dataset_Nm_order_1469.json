    "Content": "This is an exercise from Apostol, which i have been struggling for a while. Given a prime $p$, how does one show that $${n \\choose p} \\equiv \\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr] \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$$ Note that $\\Bigl[\\frac{n}{p}\\Bigr]$ denotes the integral part of $\\frac{n}{p}$. I would also like to know as to how does one try to solve this problem. Well, what we need is to show is whenever one divides ${n \\choose p}$ by a prime $p$ the remainder is the integral part of $\\frac{n}{p}$. Now, $${ n \\choose p} = \\frac{n!}{p! \\cdot (n-p)!}$$ Now $n!$ can be written as $$n!= n \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot (n-2) \\cdots (n-p) \\cdots 2 \\cdot 1$$ But i am really struggling in getting the integral part.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint $\\ $ If $\\rm\\ n\\equiv j\\ \\: (mod\\ p)\\: $ and $\\rm\\: \\bigl[\\frac{n}{p}\\bigr] = k, \\: $ then pairing factors so that top $\\equiv$ bottom $\\rm\\:(mod\\ p)\\:$ in the binomial coefficient fractions below makes the result obvious. For example $${17\\choose 7}\\ =\\ \\frac{17}3 \\frac{16}2 \\frac{15}1 \\color{#c00}{\\frac{14}7}\\frac{13}6\\frac{12}5\\frac{11}4\\,\\equiv\\, \\color{#c00}2\\, =\\, \\left\\lfloor\\frac{17}7\\right\\rfloor\\pmod 7\\qquad\\qquad\\ $$ since all of the fractions with bottom $\\rm\\ne p\\,$ are $\\,\\rm\\equiv 1\\pmod p\\,$ by top $\\equiv$ bottom, and the red term with the bottom = $\\rm \\,p = 7\\,$ is just $\\rm\\,\\color{#c00}{kp/p = k}.\\,$ Generally we have $$\\begin{eqnarray}\\rm {n \\choose p}\\ &=&\\rm\\ \\frac{n\\:(n-1)\\:\\cdots\\:(n-p+1)}{p\\:(p-1)\\:\\cdots\\: 1} \\\\\n\\\\\n &=&\\ \\rm \\frac{n}{j}\\ \\frac{n-1}{j-1}\\cdots\\frac{kp+1}{1}\\ \\color{#c00}{\\frac{kp}p}\\ \\frac{kp-1}{p-1}\\:\\cdots\\frac{n-p+2}{j+2}\\ \\frac{n-p+1}{j+1}\\end{eqnarray}$$ This is a very special case of much more general arithmetical results on binomial coefficients. For example, see Andrew Granville's very interesting survey The Arithmetic Properties of Binomial Coefficients Remark The above proof is a special case of a very simple purely arithmetical proof that I devised to show that binomial coefficients are integral. Namely, the same idea of exploiting the innate symmetry by aligning the numerators and denominators $\\rm\\:(mod\\ p)\\:$ extends to yield a simple algorithm that, given a binomial coefficient and a prime $\\rm p$, rewrites the binomial coefficient as a product of fractions whose denominators are all coprime to $\\rm p$. This implies that no prime divides the lowest-terms denominator, so that we may therefore conclude that the binomial coefficient is integral. For an example and further discussion see my post here .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"Proving ${n \\choose p} \\equiv \\Bigl[\\frac{n}{p}\\Bigr] \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$\". The question mentions that this is an exercise from Apostol, and the user is struggling to show that the binomial coefficient ${n \\choose p}$ is congruent to the integer part of n/p modulo a prime p. They also note that the integral part is denoted by [n/p].\n\nLooking at the example provided, the Assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the original problem states that p is a prime. That's a key assumption here. Also, the problem is about proving a congruence modulo p, so p must be prime for the properties related to binomial coefficients modulo primes to hold. Additionally, n is presumably an integer since we are dealing with binomial coefficients and the floor function of n/p. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that n is an integer, but since binomial coefficients are defined for integers and the floor function applies to real numbers (but here n/p would be a rational number if n and p are integers), we can infer that n is an integer. But maybe the assumption should include that n is an integer. Wait, the original problem says \"Given a prime p, how does one show that...\" and the binomial coefficient is defined for integers n and p. So both n and p are integers here, with p prime. But in the problem statement, does it specify any conditions on n? The example given in the user's example included assumptions even if they were part of the original problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. Similarly, here, the problem mentions \"Given a prime p\", so p is a prime, which is one assumption. But the problem is about binomial coefficients, so n must also be an integer, probably a non-negative integer, but maybe the problem allows n to be any integer. Wait, binomial coefficients are usually defined for non-negative integers with n ≥ p. But the problem doesn't specify that n is a non-negative integer, but since it's talking about the floor of n/p, maybe n can be any integer. However, to be precise, the binomial coefficient is defined when n is a non-negative integer and p is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n. But in this problem, p is a prime, so p is a positive integer, and n must be at least p? Or maybe not. The problem could be considering generalized binomial coefficients, but the question mentions the factorial definition, which implies that n and p are non-negative integers with n ≥ p. So perhaps the assumptions are that p is a prime number, and n is a non-negative integer. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that n is a non-negative integer. But since the problem is from Apostol, and given the context, it's likely that n is a positive integer, and p is a prime such that p ≤ n. Alternatively, maybe the problem holds for any integer n, even if n < p, but in that case, the binomial coefficient would be zero, and the floor of n/p would also be zero, so the congruence 0 ≡ 0 mod p would hold. So perhaps the problem holds for all integers n, but given that the user is asking for help, maybe the key assumption is that p is a prime. The problem statement says \"Given a prime p\", so that's one assumption. The other is that n is an integer. Wait, the problem mentions the integral part of n/p, which would require n/p to be a real number, so n must be an integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- n is an integer.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since binomial coefficients are defined for non-negative integers, but maybe Apostol's text defines it more generally. Hmm. Alternatively, the problem might not restrict n to be non-negative. For example, if n is negative, the binomial coefficient can be defined using Gamma functions, but in the context of the problem, the user is using factorial definitions, which implies n and p are non-negative integers with n ≥ p. However, the problem statement doesn't explicitly state that. Therefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. p is a prime.\n2. n is an integer (probably non-negative, but the problem doesn't specify, so just integer).\n3. The binomial coefficient ${n \\choose p}$ is defined (which would require n ≥ p ≥ 0 if we follow the standard definition, but maybe the problem allows for other cases where the binomial coefficient can be zero or defined differently).\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user is: \"how does one show that ${n \\choose p} \\equiv \\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr] \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$\". The user also mentions that they wrote the binomial coefficient as n!/(p! (n-p)!), which suggests that they are considering n and p as non-negative integers with n ≥ p. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- n ≥ p (since the binomial coefficient is defined as n!/(p!(n-p)!), but perhaps this is not an explicit assumption but a condition for the binomial coefficient to be non-zero. However, the problem might hold even when n < p, in which case the binomial coefficient is zero, and the floor of n/p is also zero, so 0 ≡ 0 mod p. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are simply p is a prime and n is an integer (non-negative). But the original problem says \"for a prime p\", so p is given as a prime, and n is any integer (probably non-negative, but the problem might work for any integer n, considering the floor function). However, since the user didn't specify any restrictions on n other than the binomial coefficient, perhaps the key assumptions are p is a prime and n is an integer. The problem may hold for all integers n (including negative?), but in the context of the problem, likely non-negative. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps it's safest to include:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a prime.\n- n is an integer.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. Here, the problem states \"Given a prime p\", so p is a prime, which is one assumption. The other is that n is an integer, but the original problem doesn't explicitly say \"for every integer n\", but the binomial coefficient is typically defined for integers. So perhaps we need to infer that n is an integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a prime.\n- n is an integer.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"This is an exercise from Apostol, which i have been struggling for a while. Given a prime p, how does one show that...\" So the problem is given a prime p, and n is presumably any integer (as the problem doesn't restrict n). But the floor function [n/p] makes sense for any real number n/p, but since n is an integer and p is a prime (hence integer), n/p is a rational number, and the floor is the integer part. So the assumptions are p is a prime and n is an integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a prime.\n- n is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $${n \\choose p} \\equiv \\biggl\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\biggr\\rfloor \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote the congruence with [n/p], which they defined as the integral part. The LaTeX code in the problem is \\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr], which is using square brackets. But the floor function is usually denoted with \\lfloor and \\rfloor. However, sometimes square brackets are used to denote the floor function, especially in older texts or certain contexts. So maybe the problem uses [n/p] to mean the floor function. Therefore, in the formatted problem, it's better to use the standard notation \\lfloor and \\rfloor for clarity, but since the original problem uses square brackets, perhaps we should keep it as \\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr] but note that it's the integral part. However, in the example provided by the user, they used \\Bigl[\\frac{n}{p}\\Bigr] in the problem statement, so perhaps we should follow the original notation. So the problem remains as:\n\nProblem:\nProve that $${n \\choose p} \\equiv \\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr] \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$$  \nwhere $\\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr]$ denotes the integral part of $\\frac{n}{p}$.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part should include the mathematical expression as given, even if using square brackets. The example didn't expand on the notation in the problem section, but in the original example, the note was included in the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem had a note: \"Note that $\\Bigl[\\frac{n}{p}\\Bigr]$ denotes the integral part of $\\frac{n}{p}$.\" So in the formatted problem, it's included as part of the problem statement. Therefore, in our current case, the problem should include that note. However, in the user's instruction, the example formatted problem included the note in the problem part. Let me check:\n\nIn the example, the original problem said \"Note that $\\Bigl[\\frac{n}{p}\\Bigr]$ denotes the integral part...\", and the formatted problem included that note in the problem statement. So in our case, the problem statement should be:\n\nProblem:\nProve that $${n \\choose p} \\equiv \\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr] \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$$  \nNote that $\\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr]$ denotes the integral part of $\\frac{n}{p}$.\n\nBut wait, in the user's example, the formatted problem's problem section included the note. However, in the user's example, the original problem had the note, and they included it. In our current problem, the original question says: \"Note that $\\Bigl[\\frac{n}{p}\\Bigr]$ denotes the integral part of $\\frac{n}{p}$.\" So we should include that note in the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the problem as:\n\nProve that $${n \\choose p} \\equiv \\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr] \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$$  \nNote that $\\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr]$ denotes the integral part of $\\frac{n}{p}$.\n\nAlternatively, since in the problem section, perhaps it's better to write it concisely. Maybe the note can be included in parentheses. But following the example, the note was part of the problem statement. So yes, we need to include it.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $p$ is a prime.\n- $n$ is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $${n \\choose p} \\equiv \\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr] \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$$  \nwhere $\\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr]$ denotes the integral part of $\\frac{n}{p}$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by $7$.\" So each assumption is a single line addressing one property. In this problem, the assumptions are that p is a prime and n is an integer. Each on their own line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$p$ is a prime,\n$n$ is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $${n \\choose p} \\equiv \\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr] \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$$  \nwhere $\\biggl[\\frac{n}{p}\\biggr]$ denotes the integral part of $\\frac{n}{p}$.\n\nYes, that looks correct. The key points are that p is prime and n is an integer. The problem is to prove the congruence modulo p between the binomial coefficient and the floor of n/p.",
