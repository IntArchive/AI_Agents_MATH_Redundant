    "Content": "Basically, I'm trying to prove (by induction) that: $$1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}+\\dots+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} > 2\\:(\\sqrt{n+1} − 1)$$ I know to begin, we should use a base case.  In this case, I'll use $1$.  So we have: $$1 > 2\\:(1+1-1) = 1>-2$$ Which works out. My problem is the next step.  What comes after this?  Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Mean Value Theorem can also be used, Let $\\displaystyle f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$ $\\displaystyle f'(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}$ Using mean value theorem we have: $\\displaystyle \\frac{f(n+1)-f(n)}{(n+1)-n}=f'(c)$ for  some $c\\in(n,n+1)$ $\\displaystyle \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\sqrt{n+1}-\\sqrt{n}}{1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}$....(1) $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n+1}}<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ Using the above ineq. in $(1)$ we have, $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{n+1}}<\\sqrt{n+1}-\\sqrt{n}<\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{n}}$ Adding the left part of the inequality we have,$\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=2}^{n}\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{k}}<\\sum_{k=2}^{n}(\\sqrt{k}-\\sqrt{k-1})=\\sqrt{n}-1$ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=2}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}<2\\sum_{k=2}^{n}(\\sqrt{k}-\\sqrt{k-1})=2(\\sqrt{n}-1)$ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle1+\\sum_{k=2}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}<1+2\\sum_{k=2}^{n}(\\sqrt{k}-\\sqrt{k-1})=2\\sqrt{n}-2+1=2\\sqrt{n}-1$ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}<2\\sqrt{n}-1$ Similarly adding the right side of the inequality we have, $\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{k}}>\\sum_{k=1}^{n}(\\sqrt{k+1}-\\sqrt{k})=\\sqrt{n+1}-1$ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}>2(\\sqrt{n+1}-1)$ This completes the proof. $\\displaystyle 2\\sqrt{n+1}-2<\\sum_{k=1}^{n}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}}<2\\sqrt{n}-1.$ This is a much better proof than proving by induction(Ofcourse if someone knows elementary calculus).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully. The user wants to prove by induction that the sum 1 + 1/√2 + 1/√3 + ... + 1/√n is greater than 2(√(n+1) − 1). The example provided in the question uses a base case of n=1, which gives 1 > 2*(√2 -1). They simplified it to 1 > 2*(1.414... -1) which is 1 > 0.828..., which is true. \n\nNow, the user is stuck on the next step, which would be the induction hypothesis and the inductive step. But our task here isn't to solve the problem, just to format it according to the example. Let me check the example again. The original problem in the example was about divisibility by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is trying to prove an inequality by induction. The assumptions here would be related to the conditions needed for the induction proof. Let's see. The base case is n=1, but induction typically requires that if it holds for n=k, it holds for n=k+1. The problem is for all positive integers n, right? So the key assumptions here would be that n is a positive integer. The original problem didn't specify any restrictions beyond that. Wait, the example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the problem presented here, the user is using induction starting at n=1, so the assumption is that n is a positive integer. There's no divisibility condition here. So maybe the assumptions are just that n is a positive integer. But looking at the original example, they broke down each assumption into separate lines. So in this case, the problem is to prove the inequality for every positive integer n. So the assumption is n is a positive integer. But maybe the user started the base case at n=1, so another assumption could be that the inequality is considered for n ≥ 1. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. So here, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. Let me check the problem statement again. The user wrote: \"Prove that [...] > 2(√(n+1) − 1)\". The original problem's title is \"Prove [...] > 2(\\sqrt{n+1} − 1)\". So the variable here is n, and the problem is for all n, presumably starting at n=1. So the assumptions would be that n is a positive integer, n ≥ 1. But in the example, they had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, maybe only one assumption: n is a positive integer. But perhaps the induction requires n ≥ 1. Wait, but in the example, the problem had an assumption that n is an integer (general) and then another that it's divisible by 7. Here, maybe the only assumption needed is that n is a positive integer. Let me verify. The problem is to prove the inequality for every n, starting from n=1 as the base case. So the assumption is n is a positive integer. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption would be \"n is a positive integer.\" The problem is to prove the given inequality. The example included specific conditions on n. Here, there's no divisibility, just that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption \"n is a positive integer\" and the problem as stated. Let me check the original problem again. The user says \"begin with base case 1\", so n=1. Then they want to do induction. So n must be a positive integer. So yes, the assumption is n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should have that assumption. Let me check if the example in the original problem had multiple assumptions. The example had two: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, perhaps only one assumption. But maybe the problem is for all integers n ≥1, so n is an integer and n ≥1. But in the example, they separated \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Similarly, here, maybe two assumptions: n is an integer, and n ≥1. However, in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify that n is an integer; they might just be assuming n is a positive integer. But in mathematical induction, n is typically a positive integer. So perhaps the assumption is \"n is a positive integer.\" Alternatively, splitting into \"n is an integer\" and \"n ≥1\". But in the example, they split into separate lines. So to follow the example format, maybe list two assumptions: n is an integer, n ≥1. But in the original problem, the title says \"for every integer n\", but in the example, they specified n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, in the original example, the problem was \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps the user's example was incorrect? Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) -6^n(...) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by7? That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example was modified to add an extra assumption. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption. But according to the example provided by the user, they restructured the problem with assumptions. So in that case, maybe the example had an error. However, the current problem here is that the user on Math Stack Exchange is trying to prove the inequality by induction, starting with n=1, and the problem is for all positive integers n. Therefore, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. So I should list that as the assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}+\\dots+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} > 2(\\sqrt{n+1} − 1)$$\n\nBut wait, in the original problem's title, the user wrote \"1+1/sqrt(2)+...+1/sqrt(n) > 2(sqrt(n+1)−1)\". So the problem is to prove that inequality for all positive integers n. The user's own example in the question uses n=1, and then is stuck on the next step, which would be the induction step. So the assumption here is that n is a positive integer, so that induction can be applied. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that assumption. Therefore, following the example's structure, even though in the example they split into two lines (n is integer, n is divisible by7), here it's just one assumption. However, if n is a positive integer, that inherently includes that n is an integer and n ≥1. So maybe split into two assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that...\n\nBut I need to check if that's necessary. The example split into two, so perhaps the user wants each assumption to be a separate line, even if they are related. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, maybe \"n is an integer\" and \"n is at least 1\". But in the original problem statement, the user starts the induction with n=1, so n must be a positive integer, which is equivalent to n being an integer and n ≥1. Therefore, to adhere to the example's format, splitting into two separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that...\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me check again. The example's original problem was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumptions were: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by7\". Wait, that contradicts the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example was wrong? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Hmm, this is confusing. But according to the user's instruction, they provided an example where they structured the problem with assumptions, even if the original problem didn't state those assumptions. Wait, perhaps the user wanted to filter out unrelated information and list all necessary assumptions. But in the example, perhaps the problem actually required n to be divisible by7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory, unless 91 divides A(n) only when n is divisible by7. So maybe the example is correct, and the original problem had an error. But that's aside. \n\nIn the current problem, to structure it correctly, we need to list all assumptions. The problem is to prove the inequality for all positive integers n. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are that n is an integer and n ≥1. Therefore, following the example's format, list each assumption on a separate line. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}+\\dots+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} > 2(\\sqrt{n+1} − 1)$$\n\nBut I should check the original problem again. The user wrote in the question: \"Prove (by induction) that: [inequality]\". So induction is the method, which requires n to be a positive integer. Therefore, the assumptions are indeed n is an integer and n ≥1. So that's two separate assumptions. Therefore, formatted correctly.",
