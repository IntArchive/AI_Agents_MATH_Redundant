    "Content": "I've been playing with the functions $$f_n:[0,\\pi/2]\\to[0,1]\\\\\\begin{cases} f_1&=&\\sin\\\\f_{n+1}&=&\\sin\\circ f_n\\end{cases}.$$ A simple argument proves that $f_n(x)\\to 0$ for $x\\in [0,\\pi/2].$ I thought it was interesting, though, how the functions did that. Near $0,$ we have $\\sin\\approx \\operatorname{id},$ so near $0,$ iterating the sine should be close to iterating the identity function. I wanted to see what happens near zero that the function $f_n$ stops behaving like the identity function and starts behaving so as to allow the convergence of the sequence to zero. I've plotted some iterations and it looks like the functions get \"broken\" near zero. The point of the \"breaking\" seems to go to zero as $n$ goes to infinity. And the \"break\" seems to get more and more \"severe\". I'll post some graphs of the following \"normalized\" functions: $$g_n:[0,\\pi/2]\\to[0,1]\\\\g_n=\\frac{f_n}{f_n(\\pi/2)}$$ These functions approximate the indicator function of the domain. (I've actually seen a proof of this. My teacher showed me when I asked him, but I've already forgotten it. I remember it involved the Stolz–Cesàro theorem.) As you can see, there are points when the functions slow down abruptly. I believe the point where it happens should be the unique zero of the third derivative of $g_n.$ It is easy to see that the first derivatives of the functions are all positive and the second derivatives are all negative. However, writing down a general formula for the third derivative is difficult. I've tried doing it despite the length, but I realized that even if I finish doing it, I'll never see anything in such a long formula. So my question is: can you see a way of proving that the third derivative of $g_n$ has a unique zero in $(0,\\pi/2)$ for $n>1?$ And if so, that those zeroes converge to zero as $n\\to \\infty?$ EDIT: I still don't know how to prove it, but my interpretation of the pictures has changed on further reflection. It seems to me that I was wrong, and the points I'm asking about are not the zeroes of the third derivatives, but their minima (zeroes of the fourth derivatives). They are points were the speed of deceleration is the greatest, not the points where the speed of deceleration is zero. This means that there is more to prove apparently. I'm still unable to handle the third derivatives of these functions, so I can't prove that the third derivatives are negative, which I now think is true. But I can't even dream of trying to write down the formula of the fourth derivative and equate it to zero to find out something about the points. $g_1$ $g_{10}$ $g_{200}$ $g_{1000}$ $g_{10000}$ $g_{100000}$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is possible to explain the location of the knee in the graphs above without taking derivatives of $f_n$ or $g_n$. Suppose that, for $x\\in(0,\\pi/2]$, we set $x_0:=x$, $x_{n+1}:=\\sin x_n$.  For all $n\\ge 0$, we then have $x_n\\in(0,\\pi/2]$, so we can set $x_n:=\\sqrt{3/t_n}$ for some $t_n=3/x_n^2$ in $[1.2,\\infty)$.  Expanding the Taylor series for $\\sin x$ around $0$, we then have\n$$x_{n+1}=x_n-\\frac{x_n^3}{6}+\\theta_n \\frac{x_n^5}{120}, \\qquad 0\\le \\theta_n\\le 1,\n$$\nso\n$$t_{n+1}=t_n (1-\\frac{1}{2 t_n} +\\theta_n \\frac{3}{40 t_n^2})^{-2}=t_n+1+O(t_n^{-1})$$\nand with some computation we can find the bounds\n$$0\\le t_{n+1}-(t_n+1)\\le \\frac{2}{t_n},$$\nso, in particular, $t_n\\ge n+1$ for all $n$ (since $t_0\\ge 1.2)$, and\n$$0\\le t_n-(t_0+n)\\le \\frac{2}{t_0}+\\cdots+\\frac{2}{t_{n-1}}\\le 2 H_n,\\qquad (*)$$\nwhere $H_n$ is the $n$th harmonic number,\n$$H_n=1+\\frac12+\\cdots+\\frac1n=O(\\log n).$$ Now, from (*), we can see that if we iterate $\\sin x$ $n$ times, starting from $x_0=\\pi/2$, we will reach the value $t_n=n+O(\\log n)$, or $M_n:=x_n=(1+o(1))\\sqrt{3/n}$.  If, as is done in the graphs above, we normalize $x_n$ by dividing by $M_n$, setting $\\bar x_n:=x_n/M_n$, we get\n$$\\bar x_n=\\sqrt{\\frac{n+O(\\log n)}{t_n}}=(1+\\frac{t_0}{n})^{-1/2} (1+O(\\frac{\\log n}{n})).\\qquad (**)$$\nTherefore, we will have $\\bar x_n\\approx 1$ for $t_0=o(n)$.  On the other hand,\nif $t_0/n\\to\\infty$, then from (*), $t_n/t_0=1+o(1)$, so $x_n=x_0(1+o(1))$     and $\\bar x_n\\approx x_0/ M_n \\approx x_0 \\sqrt{n/3}$.\nThe knee in the graph is located between these two regimes, which is where $t_0$ is on the order of $n$, i.e., $x_0$ is on the order of $\\sqrt{3/n}$.  For example, if we set $x_0=\\sqrt{3/n}$ and $t_0=n$, we see from (**) that $\\bar x_n\\to 2^{-1/2}$ as $n\\to\\infty$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe user is talking about iterated sine functions f_n defined on [0, π/2]. Each f_{n+1} is the composition of sin with f_n. They mention that f_n(x) approaches 0 for x in [0, π/2], and they're interested in how this convergence happens, especially near zero. \n\nThey introduce normalized functions g_n = f_n / f_n(π/2), which approximate the indicator function. The key part of the question is about proving that the third derivative of g_n has a unique zero in (0, π/2) for n > 1, and whether these zeros converge to zero as n approaches infinity. Later, they correct themselves, suggesting it might be the minima (zeroes of the fourth derivative) instead.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the original question is about the third derivative's unique zero. However, the edit mentions they might have been wrong and it's about the fourth derivative. But the actual question still asks about the third derivative. Hmm, the user is confused but hasn't changed the main question. The problem as posed is about the third derivative, so I should stick to that unless the user clarifies otherwise. \n\nNow, listing assumptions. The problem defines f_n recursively: f_1 is sin(x), f_{n+1} = sin(f_n). The domain is [0, π/2]. The normalized function g_n is f_n divided by f_n(π/2). They mention that first derivatives are positive, second derivatives negative. The user wants to prove that the third derivative of g_n has a unique zero in (0, π/2) for n > 1, and that these zeros converge to 0 as n → ∞.\n\nAssumptions to extract:\n\n1. Each function f_n is defined as f_1 = sin(x), f_{n+1} = sin(f_n(x)) for x in [0, π/2].\n2. The normalized function g_n is defined as g_n(x) = f_n(x) / f_n(π/2).\n3. For all n, the first derivative of g_n is positive on [0, π/2].\n4. For all n, the second derivative of g_n is negative on [0, π/2].\n5. The problem concerns the third derivative of g_n for n > 1.\n6. The question asks to prove that the third derivative of g_n has a unique zero in (0, π/2) for n > 1.\n7. Additionally, to prove that these zeros converge to zero as n approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but the user also mentions that the third derivative might actually be negative (as per their edit), but they're still asking about the unique zero. However, in the original problem statement, the user says \"can you see a way of proving that the third derivative of g_n has a unique zero...\". So the problem is about the third derivative, regardless of the user's later doubts. The assumptions would include the definitions and the properties of the first and second derivatives given (positive and negative, respectively). The problem is to prove uniqueness of zero for the third derivative and convergence to zero of those zeros.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n- f_n is defined recursively as f_1(x) = sin(x), f_{n+1}(x) = sin(f_n(x)) for x in [0, π/2].\n- g_n(x) = f_n(x) / f_n(π/2) for x in [0, π/2].\n- For each n, the first derivative g_n' is positive on [0, π/2].\n- For each n, the second derivative g_n'' is negative on [0, π/2].\n- The problem is about n > 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the third derivative of g_n has a unique zero in (0, π/2) for n > 1, and that these zeros converge to 0 as n → ∞.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions they initially thought it was the third derivative's zero but later thought maybe fourth. But the question as asked is about third derivative. The user is confused but hasn't changed the question. So we should take the problem as stated in the original question: proving unique zero of third derivative and convergence. The edit is just their own reflection but the problem remains as stated. So the answer should follow that.",
