    "Content": "Lets look at this exercise: $G$ is a finite group and $p$ is a prime that divides $|G|$. If for every element $x\\in G$ such that $g.c.d.(o(x),p)=1$, we have that $g.c.d.\\left([G:C_G(x)],p\\right)=1$, prove that $G$ is the direct product of a $p$-Sylow with a group that has order coprime with $p$. (notation: clearly $C_G(\\cdot)$ is the centralizer in $G$) If $|G|=p^rm$ ($p$ is coprime with $m$), to solve the exercise, I think that it is enough to find a normal subgroup of $G$ that has order $m$ and such that centralize a $p$-Sylow.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'd translate your condition on $G$ to \"every $p'$-element centralizes some $p$-Sylow subgroup\". As all $p$-Sylow subgroups are conjugate, this is equivalent to saying that every $p'$-element has a conjugate lying in the centralizer of a fixed $p$-Sylow subgroup $S$. For finite groups the only subgroup intersecting each conjugacy class is the whole group (see https://mathoverflow.net/questions/26979/generating-a-finite-group-from-elements-in-each-conjugacy-class ). So if you can show that the normalizer $N_G(S)$ contains a conjugate to every element of $G$ that has order a multiple of $p$, you know that $S$ is normal in $G$. Then by Schur-Zassenhaus there exists a $p'$-subgroup $H$ such that $G = S\\rtimes H$. But as $H$ centralizes $S$ by the assumptions, the product is direct. To close the gap, by Sylow's theorem it is enough to show that given an element $x \\in G$ of order divisible by $p$ it normalizes some $p$-Sylow subgroup. Write $x = y\\cdot z$ with $y$ a $p$-element, $z$ a $p'$-element and $y$ and $z$ commuting (look at $\\langle x \\rangle$ if you are unsure about the existence of such a decomposition). If $z=1$ then $x$ is contained in some $p$-Sylow subgroup. Otherwise the centralizer of $z$ contains a $p$-Sylow $T$ that wlog contains $y$. As $z$ centralizes $T$ it also normalizes it, and we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange. Let's start by reading through the original question carefully. The user is asking about a problem involving Sylow subgroups. The problem states: \n\n\"Prove that if G is a finite group and p is a prime dividing |G|, and for every element x in G where the greatest common divisor of the order of x and p is 1, it follows that the greatest common divisor of [G : C_G(x)] and p is 1, then G is the direct product of a p-Sylow subgroup and a group of order coprime with p.\"\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentioned some notation, like C_G(x) being the centralizer. The problem mentions that G is finite, p divides |G|, and for every element x in G where gcd(o(x), p) = 1, then gcd([G : C_G(x)], p) = 1. So each assumption should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. p is a prime number that divides the order of G (|G|).\n3. For every element x in G, if the greatest common divisor of the order of x (o(x)) and p is 1, then the greatest common divisor of the index [G : C_G(x)] and p is 1.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove that G is the direct product of a p-Sylow subgroup and a subgroup whose order is coprime with p. \n\nWait, in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it was stated as \"for every integer n\". However, the user's formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like they might have made a mistake, but perhaps in their example, they considered a different problem. Hmm. But in this current problem, the user didn't mention any missing assumptions, so I need to stick strictly to what's written in the question.\n\nThe user wrote: \"If |G|=p^r m (p is coprime with m), to solve the exercise, I think that it is enough to find a normal subgroup of G that has order m and such that centralize a p-Sylow.\" But this is part of the user's attempt, not the original problem. The original problem is stated in the first part. So the assumptions are as I listed above.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user says \"for every element x ∈ G such that g.c.d.(o(x),p)=1, we have that g.c.d.([G:C_G(x)],p)=1\". So that's the key condition. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. p divides |G|.\n3. For all x ∈ G with gcd(o(x), p) = 1, gcd([G : C_G(x)], p) = 1.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that G is the direct product of a p-Sylow subgroup and a group of order coprime with p.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the assumption included n being divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem statement. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the user formatted it with the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But I should follow their instruction to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So in this case, the problem is as stated, so the assumptions are the three points I listed.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\np is a prime dividing |G|,\nfor every element x ∈ G with gcd(o(x), p) = 1, gcd([G : C_G(x)], p) = 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that G is the direct product of a p-Sylow subgroup and a group of order coprime with p.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line and applied to one object. Let me check:\n\n1. G is a finite group. (One object, G; one property, being finite.)\n2. p is a prime dividing |G|. (One object, p; one condition, being a prime divisor of |G|.)\n3. For every element x ∈ G, if gcd(o(x), p) = 1, then gcd([G : C_G(x)], p) = 1. (This is a condition applied to elements x in G, but it's one condition overall. However, according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. The third point here is a single condition, so it should be one line.)\n\nYes, that seems correct. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. Similarly here, the three assumptions would each be on separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be as above.",
