    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a way to prove it without knowing the answer before hand. Let $c > 2$ be a number such that $c > e^{n+1}$. It is enough to consider $$\\int_{c}^{x} \\frac{dt}{\\log^n t}$$ Integrating by parts, we get $$\\int_{c}^{x} \\frac{dt}{\\log^n t} =  \\frac{x}{\\log^n x} - K + n \\int_{c}^{x} \\frac{dt}{\\log^{n+1} t}$$ Now $$n\\int_{c}^{x} \\frac{dt}{\\log^{n+1} t} \\le \\frac{n}{n+1} \\int_{c}^{x} \\frac{dt}{\\log^n t} $$ as $\\log t \\ge n+1$ for $t \\ge c$ Thus $$\\frac{1}{n+1}\\int_{c}^{x} \\frac{dt}{\\log^n t} < \\frac{x}{\\log^n x}  $$ In fact, we have that $$\\int_{2}^{x} \\frac{dt}{\\log^n t} = \\theta(\\frac{x}{\\log^n x})$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and identify the assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe title of the question is \"Bounding the integral ∫₂ˣ dt/(logⁿ t)\". The question states: If x ≥ 2, then how do we prove that ∫₂ˣ dt/(logⁿ t) = O(x/logⁿ x)? \n\nSo the main problem is to prove that the integral from 2 to x of 1/(log t)ⁿ dt is Big O of x/(log x)ⁿ. The assumptions here are probably the conditions given in the problem. The first assumption is x ≥ 2. The integral is from 2 to x, so the lower limit is 2, which might be important. Also, the integrand is 1/(log t)ⁿ, so n is some exponent. The problem mentions that x is greater than or equal to 2, so that's one assumption. \n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, the assumption was split into two: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. However, in the current problem, the user hasn't specified any conditions on n. The integral is ∫₂ˣ dt/(logⁿ t), and they want to show it's O(x/logⁿ x). So, perhaps n is a positive integer? But the problem as stated doesn't specify. The original question might assume n is a positive integer, or maybe a real number? The problem statement as given in the question just says \"log^{n} t\", which usually implies n is an integer unless specified otherwise, but sometimes it's used for real exponents. Since the user didn't specify, but in the example, they included assumptions from the problem. Here, the problem says \"If x ≥ 2\", so that's one assumption. But maybe n is a fixed positive integer? The problem doesn't specify, but to answer the question, we might need to assume n is a positive integer. However, the original problem didn't state any restrictions on n. Wait, but maybe the integral is for any n, so perhaps n is a positive real number? Hmm. The question doesn't specify, so perhaps we shouldn't make assumptions beyond what's given. The problem as stated only has x ≥ 2. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number greater than or equal to 2.\n- The integral is taken from 2 to x.\n- The integrand is 1/(log t)^n.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. The original problem here is to bound the integral in terms of x and n, so perhaps the problem assumes that n is a fixed positive integer, but since the original problem doesn't specify, maybe we can't include that. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"log^{n} t\", which in math notation, if n is a variable exponent, it's typically assumed to be a positive integer unless otherwise stated, but sometimes people use real exponents. However, without more information, maybe the only explicit assumption given in the problem is x ≥ 2.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"If x ≥ 2, then how do we prove...\". So the primary assumption is x ≥ 2. But maybe there's an implicit assumption that n is a positive integer or real number. However, since the problem statement doesn't specify, perhaps we can only list the explicit assumption. However, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n needs to be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that can't be right. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. That seems like an error. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, when applying the format, I should be careful. The user might have provided a flawed example.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants us to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example includes assumptions, possibly including both the given conditions and perhaps some implicit ones. However, given that the example might be wrong, but following the user's instruction, we have to proceed.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is: If x ≥ 2, prove that the integral from 2 to x of dt/(logⁿ t) is O(x/logⁿ x). So the explicit assumption is x ≥ 2. But to perform the integral, we also have to consider that the integrand is defined. The logarithm in the denominator, log t, for t ≥ 2, log t is positive (since t ≥ 2, log t ≥ log 2 > 0). Therefore, log t is positive, and raising it to the power n (whatever n is) would keep the denominator positive as long as n is a real number. However, if n is such that logⁿ t is zero or undefined, that would be an issue. But since t ≥ 2, log t is at least log 2 > 0, so logⁿ t is defined for any real exponent n. Therefore, the integral is well-defined for any real number n, as long as t ≥ 2. Therefore, the problem's only explicit condition is x ≥ 2. However, the problem might have an implicit assumption that n is a positive integer, but since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we can't include that. Therefore, the only assumption we can list is x ≥ 2. However, in the integral, the variable of integration is t, going from 2 to x. So perhaps another assumption is that the integral is taken over the interval [2, x]. But that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\", which was part of the original problem's statement \"for every integer n\". Therefore, in the current problem, the assumption is x ≥ 2, as given in the problem statement. The other elements, like the integral being from 2 to x and the integrand being 1/(log t)^n, are part of the problem's statement, not assumptions. So perhaps the only assumption here is x ≥ 2. However, maybe the problem also assumes that n is a fixed positive integer, but since it's not stated, perhaps we shouldn't include that unless the original problem implies it. Since the original problem uses \"log^{n}t\", which is standard notation for any exponent n, not necessarily integer. Therefore, perhaps the only explicit assumption is x ≥ 2. \n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number greater than or equal to 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{2}^{x} \\frac{\\mathrm dt}{\\log^{n}{t}} = O\\left(\\frac{x}{\\log^{n}{x}}\\right).$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were split into separate lines. In the current problem, the only assumption is x ≥ 2. Therefore, the assumption section should list that. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number greater than or equal to 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{2}^{x} \\frac{\\mathrm dt}{\\log^{n}{t}} = O\\left(\\frac{x}{\\log^{n}{x}}\\right).$$\n\nBut the original question didn't specify if n is a positive integer, real number, etc. But the problem as stated is to prove the integral is Big O of x/(log^n x). The Big O notation is about the behavior as x approaches infinity, so maybe another implicit assumption is that x is tending to infinity, but in the problem statement, x is just any number ≥2. However, in asymptotic analysis, when we say f(x) = O(g(x)), we usually consider x approaching infinity, unless specified otherwise. So perhaps another assumption is that x is sufficiently large, but the problem states x ≥ 2. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"If x ≥ 2\", so we have to take x ≥ 2 as given. Therefore, the assumption is just x ≥ 2. But in the context of Big O notation, the result is likely intended for x tending to infinity, so maybe the problem wants to show that the integral is asymptotically bounded by C*x/(log^n x) for some constant C as x approaches infinity. Therefore, the assumption is x ≥ 2, and the problem is to prove the asymptotic bound. Hence, the formatted problem should have the assumption as x ≥ 2 and the problem as stated. \n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem is as above.",
