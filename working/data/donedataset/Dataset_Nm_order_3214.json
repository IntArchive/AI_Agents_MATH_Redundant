    "Content": "I am working on the problem from \" Ideas, Varieties and Algorithms \" by David Cox, John Little and Donal O'Shea. Here is the homework problem for my course. Let $V \\subset k^n$ and $W \\subset k^m$ be two affine varieties, and let $$\\begin{aligned}\nV \\times W &= \\{(x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m) \\in k^{n + m}|\\\\&\\quad(x_1, \\dots x_n) \\in k^n, (y_1, \\dots y_m) \\in k^m\\}\n\\end{aligned}$$ be their cartesian product.  Prove that $V \\times W$ is an affine variety in $k^{n + m}$.  Hint: If $V$ is defined by $f_1, \\dots, f_s \\in k[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$, then we can regard $f_1, \\dots, f_s$ as polynomials in $k[x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m]$, and similarly for $W$.  Show that this gives defining equations for the cartesian product. My Attempt Assume that $V \\subset k^n$ and $W \\subset k^m$ are affine varieties.  That is:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nV &= \\{(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in k^n |f_1=f_2=\\cdots=f_s = 0 \\}\\\\\nW &= \\{(y_1, \\dots, y_m) \\in k^m |g_1=g_2=\\cdots=g_t = 0 \\}\n\\end{aligned}$$ As already given\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nV \\times W &= \\{(x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m) \\in k^{n + m}|\\\\&\\quad(x_1, \\dots x_n) \\in k^n, (y_1, \\dots y_m) \\in k^m\\}\n\\end{aligned}$$ Using the hint for this problem, we have the following: If $V$ is defined by $f_1, \\dots, f_s \\in k[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$, then we can regard $f_1, \\dots, f_s$ as polynomials in $k[x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m]$ Likewise, if $W$ is defined by $g_1, \\dots, g_t \\in k[y_1, \\dots, y_m]$, then we can regard $g_1, \\dots, g_t$ as polynomials in $k[x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m]$ I am not sure what to claim for this problem (e.g. for $V \\cup W$, we claim $V \\cup W = \\mathbf{V}(f_ig_i : 1 \\leq i \\leq s, 1 \\leq i \\leq t)$), so I go on and write what I understand about this problem... Set $(x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m) \\in (V \\times W)$, where $(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in V$ and $(y_1, \\dots, y_m) \\in W$.  Then, at the same time $f_1, \\dots, f_s$ vanish at $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ and $g_1, \\dots, g_t$ vanish at $(y_1, \\dots, y_m)$. For the next step, I thought for around hours or so and then gave the following try: Since $f_1, \\dots, f_s \\in k[x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m]$, and $f_1, \\dots, f_s$ vanish at $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, the set of those polynomials also vanish at $(x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$.  Likewise, since $g_1, \\dots, g_t \\in k[x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m]$ and $g_1, \\dots, g_t$ vanish at $(y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, the set of those polynomials also vanish at $(x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$.  So $f_ig_j$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq s$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq t$ vanish at $(x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$. I think my proof needs a bit of adjustment or extra reasoning, but I'm not sure about this. Any advices or comments about my approach?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Looks like the correct approach. Note that what you're showing is that\n$$V \\times W = \\{(x_1, \\dots,x_n,y_1, \\dots, y_m) \\in k^{n+m} \\mid f_1(x) = \\dots = f_s(x) = 0, g_1(y) = \\dots = g_t(y) = 0 \\}.$$ If you feel uncomfortable because the defining equations should be polynomials in $x, y$ (instead of just in $x$ for the $f$'s and just in $y$ for the $g$'s), you might want to make things explicit. Say $\\hat {f_i}(x_1,\\dots,x_n,y_1,\\dots,y_m) = f_i(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ (i.e., $f_i$ explicitly considered as a polynomial in $x, y$) and similarly $\\hat{g_j}(x_1,\\dots,x_n,y_1,\\dots,y_m) = g_j(y_1,\\dots,y_m)$. Phrased this way, you're showing that\n$$V \\times W = \\{(x_1, \\dots,x_n,y_1, \\dots, y_m) \\in k^{n+m} \\mid \\hat{f_1}(x,y) = \\dots = \\hat{f_s}(x,y) = 0, \\hat{g_1}(x,y) = \\dots = \\hat{g_t}(x, y) = 0 \\},$$\nbut the right-hand side of this is of course still equal to \n$$\\{(x_1, \\dots,x_n,y_1, \\dots, y_m) \\in k^{n+m} \\mid f_1(x) = \\dots = f_s(x) = 0, g_1(y) = \\dots = g_t(y) = 0 \\},$$\nso that is really just a notational issue.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original question. The problem is about proving that the Cartesian product of two affine varieties V and W is itself an affine variety. \n\nLooking at the original problem, the user mentions that V and W are affine varieties in k^n and k^m respectively. So the first assumption is that V is an affine variety in k^n. Similarly, W is an affine variety in k^m. The definition of an affine variety here would be a set defined by the vanishing of polynomials, so V is defined by polynomials f_1,...,f_s in k[x_1,...,x_n], and W is defined by g_1,...,g_t in k[y_1,...,y_m]. \n\nThe problem then defines the Cartesian product V × W as a subset of k^{n+m}, consisting of points where the first n coordinates are in V and the next m coordinates are in W. The task is to prove this product is an affine variety. \n\nThe hint suggests lifting the defining equations of V and W into the larger polynomial ring k[x_1,...,x_n,y_1,...,y_m]. So another assumption might be that these lifted polynomials define the product variety. But in the original problem statement, the user is asking to show that V × W is affine, given that V and W are affine. \n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n1. V is an affine variety in k^n.\n2. W is an affine variety in k^m.\n3. The defining equations for V are f_1,...,f_s in k[x_1,...,x_n].\n4. The defining equations for W are g_1,...,g_t in k[y_1,...,y_m].\n5. These equations can be viewed in the larger ring k[x_1,...,x_n,y_1,...,y_m].\n6. The product V × W is the set of points in k^{n+m} where the first n coordinates are in V and the last m are in W.\n\nWait, but the problem statement already states that V and W are affine varieties, so the first two assumptions are about V and W being affine. Then, their definitions via the polynomials are part of their structure as varieties. The problem is to show their product is affine, which requires showing that V × W can be defined by polynomial equations in the larger space. The user's attempt considers lifting the equations of V and W to the larger ring and evaluating them on the product coordinates. \n\nSo, in terms of assumptions for the problem, each line should be a single condition on one object. Therefore, each assumption should be listed separately. Let me parse the original question again:\n\nOriginal problem statement: Prove that if V and W are affine varieties, then V × W is an affine variety. Given that V is defined by f_1,...,f_s and W by g_1,...,g_t, the hint suggests using these polynomials in the larger ring. \n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- V is an affine variety in k^n.\n- W is an affine variety in k^m.\n- V is defined by polynomials f_1, ..., f_s ∈ k[x_1, ..., x_n].\n- W is defined by polynomials g_1, ..., g_t ∈ k[y_1, ..., y_m].\n- The Cartesian product V × W is the set of points in k^{n+m} with (x_1,...,x_n) in V and (y_1,...,y_m) in W.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were things like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, we need to list all the conditions given in the problem. The problem states V and W are affine varieties, so that's two assumptions. Then, the definition of V × W as a subset of k^{n+m} with coordinates in V and W. The rest might be part of the problem setup but not assumptions. Wait, the user also mentions that they can regard f_i and g_j in the larger polynomial ring. Is that part of the problem's given conditions or part of the hint? The problem includes the hint as part of the question, so perhaps the fact that f_i and g_j can be considered in the larger ring is part of the problem's assumptions. However, the problem doesn't state that explicitly as a given; the hint suggests doing that. So maybe the user is supposed to use that idea, but it's not an assumption per se. \n\nSo the problem as stated requires proving V × W is affine given that V and W are affine. The rest is the setup. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- V is an affine variety in k^n.\n- W is an affine variety in k^m.\n- The Cartesian product V × W is defined as the set of points (x_1,...,x_n, y_1,...,y_m) in k^{n+m} such that (x_1,...,x_n) ∈ V and (y_1,...,y_m) ∈ W.\n\nBut maybe the definitions of V and W via their ideals are part of the assumptions. The problem says \"if V and W are affine varieties\", which in algebraic geometry terms means they are defined by polynomial equations. So perhaps each assumption is:\n\n- V is a subset of k^n defined by the vanishing of polynomials f_1, ..., f_s ∈ k[x_1, ..., x_n].\n- W is a subset of k^m defined by the vanishing of polynomials g_1, ..., g_t ∈ k[y_1, ..., y_m].\n- V × W is the subset of k^{n+m} consisting of points (x, y) where x ∈ V and y ∈ W.\n\nThus, the problem is to show that V × W, defined as such, is an affine variety, i.e., it can be defined by the vanishing of some set of polynomials in k[x_1,...,x_n,y_1,...,y_m].\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an affine variety in k^n,\nW is an affine variety in k^m,\nV is defined by polynomials f_1, ..., f_s ∈ k[x_1, ..., x_n],\nW is defined by polynomials g_1, ..., g_t ∈ k[y_1, ..., y_m],\nV × W is the set {(x_1, ..., x_n, y_1, ..., y_m) ∈ k^{n+m} | (x_1, ..., x_n) ∈ V and (y_1, ..., y_m) ∈ W}.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that V × W is an affine variety. The user's attempt considers lifting the equations of V and W into the larger polynomial ring and using them to define V × W. So perhaps the key is that the defining equations for V × W are the union of the lifted equations from V and W. Therefore, the problem is to show that these lifted equations define V × W.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions included specific conditions on the variables or objects involved. So in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n1. V is an affine variety in k^n.\n2. W is an affine variety in k^m.\n3. The Cartesian product V × W is as defined in the problem statement.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The definitions via polynomials are part of what it means for V and W to be affine varieties. Therefore, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an affine variety in k^n,\nW is an affine variety in k^m,\nV × W is defined as {(x_1,...,x_n,y_1,...,y_m) ∈ k^{n+m} | (x_1,...,x_n) ∈ V, (y_1,...,y_m) ∈ W}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that V × W is an affine variety in k^{n+m}.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem mentioned the definition of V and W via polynomials. However, in the example given by the user, the formatted problem didn't restate all the definitions unless they were part of the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The user formatted it with the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is not part of the problem's original statement. That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example was a misapplication. However, since that's the example provided, maybe the user intended to extract specific conditions from the problem. However, in that case, the original problem's divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13) might require that the expression is divisible by both 7 and 13. If the problem is to prove it for every integer n, then perhaps the user made a mistake in adding \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, unless there was a typo in the original problem. Alternatively, perhaps the example was incorrect. \n\nBut in any case, going back to the current problem. The current problem is to prove that if V and W are affine varieties, then their Cartesian product is an affine variety. The original problem's assumptions are that V and W are affine varieties. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an affine variety in k^n,\nW is an affine variety in k^m,\nV × W is the Cartesian product of V and W as defined in k^{n+m}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that V × W is an affine variety in k^{n+m}.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user also defines V and W via their equations. Since being an affine variety means being defined by polynomial equations, perhaps the assumptions should include that V and W are defined by those polynomials. The original problem states:\n\n\"Assume that V ⊂ k^n and W ⊂ k^m are affine varieties. That is:\nV = {(x_1, ..., x_n) ∈ k^n | f_1=...=f_s=0}\nW = {(y_1, ..., y_m) ∈ k^m | g_1=...=g_t=0}\"\n\nSo in the problem, the fact that V and W are defined by those specific equations is part of their definition as affine varieties. Therefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- V is defined by polynomials f_1, ..., f_s ∈ k[x_1, ..., x_n],\n- W is defined by polynomials g_1, ..., g_t ∈ k[y_1, ..., y_m].\n\nTherefore, combining all these, the formatted problem would have assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an affine variety in k^n defined by f_1, ..., f_s ∈ k[x_1, ..., x_n],\nW is an affine variety in k^m defined by g_1, ..., g_t ∈ k[y_1, ..., y_m],\nV × W is the subset {(x_1, ..., x_n, y_1, ..., y_m) ∈ k^{n+m} | (x_1, ..., x_n) ∈ V and (y_1, ..., y_m) ∈ W}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that V × W is an affine variety in k^{n+m}.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So splitting the first two into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\nV is an affine variety in k^n,\nV is defined by polynomials f_1, ..., f_s ∈ k[x_1, ..., x_n],\nW is an affine variety in k^m,\nW is defined by polynomials g_1, ..., g_t ∈ k[y_1, ..., y_m],\nV × W is the subset {(x_1, ..., x_n, y_1, ..., y_m) ∈ k^{n+m} | (x_1, ..., x_n) ∈ V and (y_1, ..., y_m) ∈ W}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that V × W is an affine variety in k^{n+m}.\n\nThis way, each line is a separate assumption about one object (V, W, V×W). The first line states V is an affine variety in k^n, the next specifies its defining polynomials, similarly for W, and finally the definition of V×W. \n\nI think this fits the required format. Each assumption is a single condition on a single object. The problem is to prove the product is affine.",
