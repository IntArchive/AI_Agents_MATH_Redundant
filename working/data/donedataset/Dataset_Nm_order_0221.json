    "AcceptedAnswer": "You have to use the axiom of choice in the infinite case. And this usage is essential because it is consistent that there are sets which cannot be linearly ordered (in which the case the identity relation cannot be extended to a linear order). Let $(P,R)$ be a partially ordered set. We define the collection $\\{\\leq\\mid (P,\\leq)\\text{ is a poset and }R\\subseteq\\leq\\}$, order this by $\\subseteq$ and show it satisfies the conditions of Zorn's lemma. The maximal element has to be a linear order. It should be remarked that simply requiring that every partially ordered set can be extended to a linear order is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice. Here is a very neat trick using the Compactness Theorem of first-order logic (which is weaker than the axiom of choice). Although you probably didn't cover that in the course, it's a nice trick to know: Let $(P,\\leq)$ be a partially ordered set. Let $\\cal L$ be the language with one binary relation $\\preceq$ and a constant symbol $c_p$ for every $p\\in P$. We write the following $T$: $\\preceq$ is a partial order; whenever $p\\leq q$ we add the axiom $c_p\\preceq c_q$; for every pair $p,q\\in P$ we add the axiom $c_p\\preceq c_q\\lor c_q\\preceq c_p$. Now we will show that $T$ is finitely-satisfiable. If $S\\subseteq T$ has only axioms of the form $1$ or from the schema described in $2$ then $(P,\\leq)$ is a model for $S$. Otherwise it has a finite number of axioms from the schema in $3$. We can extend $\\leq$ to some $\\leq^\\ast$ which satisfy these axioms. We do this by induction: if there is only one axiom and it hasn't been satisfied then $p$ and $q$ are incomparable, and we can take $\\leq^\\ast=\\leq\\cup\\{\\langle p,q'\\rangle\\mid q\\leq q'\\}$. Suppose we did this for $k$ axioms; simply repeat the argument for the $k+1$. This requires no axiom of choice because we only have to make finitely many choices. (Alternatively one can replace schema $3$ by the axiom $3'$, $\\forall x\\forall y(x\\preceq y\\lor y\\preceq x)$, now notice that any finite fragment talks only about finitely many constants, $c_{p_1},\\ldots,c_{p_k}$. Restricting $\\leq$ to $\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_k\\}$ is a finite partially ordered set, and can be extended to a linear ordering which satisfies $3'$ as wanted.) Therefore every finite fragment of $T$ has a model, and so by the compactness theorem $T$ itself has a model $(P',\\leq')$. We define $\\preceq$ on $P$ as follows: $p\\preceq q\\iff (P',\\leq')\\models c_p\\preceq c_q$. The schema $2$ ensures this extends $\\leq$, and schema $3$ (or axiom $3'$) ensures this is a linear ordering.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that every partial order can be extended to a linear ordering. They mentioned they can do it for finite sets but are stuck on infinite sets. Alright, first, I need to structure the problem according to the given format.\n\nThe original question is about extending a partial order to a linear order. The key assumptions here are that we have a set with a partial order, and we need to extend it to a linear order. The problem is for both finite and infinite sets, but the user is specifically asking about the infinite case after handling the finite one.\n\nWait, the example given had assumptions listed line by line, each about one property of one object. So here, the main assumptions are:\n\n1. There exists a set (let's call it P) with a partial order (≤).\n2. The partial order ≤ is defined on set P.\n3. The problem is to extend this partial order to a linear (total) ordering.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were specific, like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In this case, the problem is more general. The user is asking about any partial order, not under specific conditions. But perhaps the assumptions are implicit here. Let me think.\n\nThe problem statement is: \"Every partial order can be extended to a linear ordering.\" So the assumptions would be:\n\n- Let P be a set.\n- Let ≤ be a partial order on P.\n- There exists a linear order ≤' on P such that ≤' extends ≤.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such a linear order exists. So in the assumption section, we need to list the conditions given. Since the problem is general, the assumptions are just that we have a set with a partial order. The user also mentions they can do it for finite sets but need help with infinite. So the problem is about extending a partial order on any set (including infinite) to a linear order.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\n- P is a set.\n- ≤ is a partial order on P.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a linear ordering ≤' on P such that ≤' extends ≤.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is general, so the assumptions are just the existence of the partial order on a set. However, the user is asking about how to handle infinite sets. But the problem statement itself doesn't add extra conditions; it's a general claim. Therefore, the assumptions are just the basic setup: a set with a partial order. The problem is to extend it to a linear order.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a set,\n≤ is a partial order on P.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a linear ordering ≤' on P such that ≤' extends ≤.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions \"every partial order can be extended to a linear ordering.\" So the problem is to show that for any set P and any partial order ≤ on P, there's a linear order ≤' that extends it. The user is asking about the infinite case. But the problem as stated is general. The answer would involve using something like the Szpilrajn extension theorem, which uses Zorn's lemma for infinite sets. But the formatting just needs to structure the problem, not the answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct format should capture the problem as stated, filtering out the extra information about finite and infinite. The user's question is about the method for infinite after handling finite, but in the problem structure, we just present the core problem. So the assumptions are the existence of a partial order on a set, and the problem is to prove the existence of a linear extension.\n\nYes, that seems right. The example given in the user's prompt had specific conditions, but in this case, the problem is more general. So the formatted problem should list the basic assumptions: a set with a partial order, and the task is to extend it to a linear order.",
