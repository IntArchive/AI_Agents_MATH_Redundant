    "Content": "Consider the following statement: For any integer $n>1$ there is a prime number strictly between $n$ and $n^2$. This problem was given as an (extra) qualification problem for certain workshops (which I unfortunately couldn't attend). There was a requirement to not use Bertrand's postulate (with which the problem is nearly trivial), and I was told that there does exist a moderately short proof of this statement not using Bertrand. This is my question: How can one prove the above statement without Bertrand postulate or any strong theorems? Although I can only accept one answer, I would love to see any argument you can come up with. I would also want to exclude arguments using a proof of Bertrand's postulate, unless it can be significantly simplified to prove weaker statement. Thank you in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I have stumbled upon this paper due to Erdős, which in the course of proving something far more general proves this result (see a remark at the end of this page). I am replicating that proof here, with minor modifications by myself. Suppose $n>8$ and that there are no primes between $n,n^2$ . Since clearly (obvious induction works) $\\pi(n)\\leq\\frac{1}{2}n$ , by assumption we have $\\pi(n^2)=\\pi(n)\\leq\\frac{1}{2}n$ . Now consider number $\\binom{n^2}{n}$ . All of its prime factors are less than $n^2$ , and so less than $n$ . We have the following inequality: $$\\binom{n^2}{n}=\\frac{n^2}{n}\\frac{n^2-1}{n-1}\\dots\\frac{n^2-n+2}{2}\\frac{n^2-n+1}{1}>\\frac{n^2}{n}\\frac{n^2}{n}\\dots\\frac{n^2}{n}\\frac{n^2}{n}=\\left(\\frac{n^2}{n}\\right)^n=n^n$$ At the same time, consider $p$ prime and let $p^a$ be the greatest power of $p$ less than or equal to $n^2$ . Since $\\binom{n^2}{n}=\\frac{(n^2)!}{(n^2-n)!n!}$ , By Legendre's formula, exponent of the greatest power of $p$ dividing this binomial coefficient is equal to $$\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^2}{p}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^2-n}{p}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p}\\right\\rfloor\\right)+\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^2}{p^2}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^2-n}{p^2}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p^2}\\right\\rfloor\\right)+\\dots+\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^2}{p^a}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n^2-n}{p^a}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p^a}\\right\\rfloor\\right)\\leq 1+1+\\dots+1=a$$ (first equality is true, because all further terms in the sum are zero. First inequality is true because for any $a,b\\in\\Bbb R$ $\\lfloor a+b\\rfloor-\\lfloor a\\rfloor-\\lfloor b\\rfloor\\in\\{0,1\\}$ ) Since $\\binom{n^2}{n}$ is a product of at most $\\pi(n)$ prime powers, all at most $p^a\\leq n^2$ (by above), we must have $$\\binom{n^2}{n}\\leq (n^2)^{\\pi(n)}\\leq (n^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}n}=n^n$$ We have proved two contradictory inequalities, so this ends the proof by contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving that for any integer n > 1, there's a prime strictly between n and n² without using Bertrand's postulate. They mentioned that Bertrand makes it almost trivial, so the challenge is to find another method, maybe using more elementary number theory concepts.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states \"for any integer n > 1\", so the first assumption is that n is an integer greater than 1. Then, the goal is to show there exists a prime between n and n². The constraints are not using Bertrand's postulate or strong theorems, and avoiding proofs that are just simplified versions of Bertrand's proof.\n\nSo, the key points to capture in the formatted problem are:\n\n1. The variable n is an integer.\n2. The integer n is greater than 1.\n3. The problem requires proving the existence of a prime number strictly between n and n².\n4. The proof should not use Bertrand's postulate or similar strong theorems.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Here, n has two conditions: being an integer and being greater than 1. Each of those should be separate lines in the assumptions. The problem statement then is about the existence of the prime in that interval without Bertrand. The user also mentions excluding arguments that use Bertrand's proof unless significantly simplified, but since the main instruction is to avoid Bertrand altogether, maybe that's an additional note, but the main problem statement would just mention the exclusion of Bertrand's postulate.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn > 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a prime number strictly between n and n² without using Bertrand's postulate or any strong theorems.\n\nThat should cover it. The original problem's title mentions \"without Bertrand,\" so that's crucial to include. The problem statement in the question is the same as the title but elaborated. The user wants a proof using elementary methods. So the formatted problem should encapsulate all these points.",
