    "Content": "It is a nontrivial fact that there are only countably many isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups. One can prove this by a series of reductions: first to the connected case, then to the simply connected case, then by classifying simple Lie algebras. Of course, this proof actually gives a much stronger classification result. If I only want to prove that there are countably many isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups, can I work without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras? I have some ideas involving Tannaka's theorem but I haven't worked out a proof yet.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It suffices to show that for each $n$, there are only countably many non-isomorphic compact $n$-dimensional Lie algebras. Let $M_n$ be the space of $n$-dimensional Lie algebras: This is a certain affine variety. According to https://mathoverflow.net/questions/47447/deformations-of-semisimple-lie-algebras (see Ben Webster's answer, which does not use any structure theory), for every compact Lie algebra $g\\in M_n$, all nearby Lie algebras are isomorphic to $g$. Therefore, the subset $C_n\\subset M_n$ consisting of compact Lie algebras is discrete and, hence, countable.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows how to list assumptions line by line and then state the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is asking if we can prove there are countably many isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups without using the classification of simple Lie algebras. The user mentions that the usual proof uses a series of reductions leading to the classification of simple Lie algebras, but they want a proof that avoids that step, possibly using Tannaka's theorem.\n\nSo, the main problem here is to prove the countability of isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups without invoking the classification of simple Lie algebras. The assumptions need to be broken down into individual conditions applied to one object each.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the key assumptions are:\n1. Considering compact Lie groups.\n2. The goal is about isomorphism classes (so we're considering groups up to isomorphism).\n3. The proof should not use the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, the assumptions included conditions on the object in the problem. Here, the problem is more about the method of proof rather than conditions on the Lie groups themselves. The example had assumptions on 'n', but here the assumptions are about the approach. However, the format requires assumptions to be properties or conditions applied to one object. Maybe I need to frame the assumptions as the properties the groups must satisfy and the constraints on the proof method.\n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n- The groups considered are compact Lie groups.\n- Isomorphism classes are considered (i.e., two groups are equivalent if isomorphic).\n- The proof must not use the classification theorem of simple Lie algebras.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The first two are about the objects (the groups), and the third is a constraint on the method. But according to the example, the assumptions are about the problem's conditions, not the proof method. Wait, in the example, the assumption was that 'n' is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem's conditions are that the groups are compact Lie groups, and we want to count their isomorphism classes. The additional constraint is on the method, not the problem itself. Hmm, maybe the user's format expects the problem's inherent assumptions, not the proof constraints. But the original problem says \"without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras,\" which is a condition on the proof method. So perhaps in this case, the assumption should include that the proof must avoid using the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the problem's variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the problem is a meta-mathematical question about the existence of a certain type of proof. So how to structure that?\n\nThe problem is to prove that there are countably many isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups. The key conditions are that the groups are compact and Lie, and the proof should not use the classification of simple Lie algebras. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nCompact Lie groups are considered,\nIsomorphism classes are considered,\nThe classification of simple Lie algebras is not used in the proof.\n\nBut each assumption should apply to one object. Wait, maybe:\n\n- The objects under consideration are compact Lie groups.\n- Isomorphism between compact Lie groups is considered.\n- The proof does not utilize the classification theorem of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut the third one is about the method, not the object. The example's assumptions were about the problem's variables. So perhaps in this case, since the problem is about the existence of a proof under certain constraints, the assumptions are the conditions that the proof must satisfy. But the format might require the problem's assumptions, not the proof's. However, the original question's problem is to prove the countability without using the classification. So the problem's condition is that the proof must avoid that classification. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups,\nThe proof must not appeal to the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut the user's example included two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, the first assumption is the objects (compact Lie groups), the second is the constraint on the proof. So perhaps that's acceptable. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition. So here, the two main assumptions are that we're dealing with compact Lie groups and that the proof must not use the classification. However, the problem itself is to show there are countably many isomorphism classes. So structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups,\nThe classification of simple Lie algebras is not used in the proof.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups.\n\nBut the original question also mentions that isomorphism classes are considered, so maybe that's another assumption. Wait, the problem is about isomorphism classes, so perhaps that's part of the problem statement. For example, in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove the countability of isomorphism classes, so the assumptions would be the groups are compact Lie groups, and the proof method constraint. The fact that isomorphism classes are considered is part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, let's look at the original example again. The problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" and the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is \"Prove that there are countably many isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups,\" so the assumptions would be the conditions on the groups (they are compact Lie groups) and any other conditions (like not using the classification). The part about isomorphism classes is inherent to the problem statement.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups,\nThe proof does not use the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many isomorphism classes.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question includes \"of compact Lie groups,\" so maybe the problem line should include that. Wait, in the example, the problem line was \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91,\" which included the object. So here, the problem would be \"Prove that there are countably many isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups,\" and the assumption is that the proof does not use the classification. But the assumption part is for conditions on the objects or variables. However, the constraint on the proof method is part of the problem's requirement. So perhaps the problem statement should include the constraint. But in the example, the assumption included both n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups,\nIsomorphism classes are considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many such classes without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem line as \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91,\" with assumptions on n. So here, the problem line should state what needs to be proven, and the assumptions are the conditions on the groups and the method. However, the original question's problem is to prove countability without using the classification. Therefore, the problem line should include both the countability and the constraint on the proof method.\n\nAlternatively, the assumption part can include the method constraint. But according to the example, assumptions are about the problem's variables or objects. The method constraint is part of the problem statement. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, maybe the only assumption is that the groups are compact Lie groups, and the problem includes the method constraint. But the original question's problem is to prove countability without using the classification. Therefore, the problem line should include the \"without appealing...\" part. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups,\nIsomorphism classes are considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many isomorphism classes without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut perhaps \"isomorphism classes are considered\" is redundant because the problem is about isomorphism classes. Hmm. The example's problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is about countability of isomorphism classes, so the assumptions are the groups are compact Lie, and the proof method constraint is part of the problem. Alternatively, the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is a condition on the variable. Here, the analogous assumption is that the groups are compact Lie. The proof method constraint is part of the problem statement. However, in the original example, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that it's divisible by 7, even though the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. The divisibility by 7 is part of the assumptions, but in reality, the original problem didn't have that assumption—it was a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example's problem was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption included n divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the user's format regardless.\n\nAssuming that in the example, the user added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) even though the original problem didn't state that. But perhaps the user intended to modify the problem. So maybe the example is not accurate, but we have to follow the format they provided. Therefore, in the current problem, we need to list all assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's inherent conditions.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The groups are compact Lie groups.\n- Isomorphism classes are considered.\n- The proof does not use the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut each assumption should apply to one object. The third one is about the proof method, not an object. So maybe the user's format allows for such assumptions if they are part of the problem's conditions. Alternatively, maybe the third point is part of the problem statement. Given the example's inconsistency, it's a bit confusing. But following the user's instruction to structure it as in the example, where assumptions are listed even if they modify the original problem, perhaps here the assumption is that the proof must not use the classification. But the example had assumptions on the variable, not the method. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem line should include the constraint, and the assumptions are only about the objects. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many isomorphism classes without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut the original question's title includes \"without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras,\" which is part of the problem's condition. Therefore, the problem line should include that constraint. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumption being the groups are compact Lie, and the problem line includes the constraint. But the example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original example's problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91,\" but the formatted problem's assumption included that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to modify the problem, but in reality, the original problem didn't have that assumption. Therefore, maybe the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the user's format as given.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is asking to prove countability without using the classification. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The groups considered are compact Lie groups.\n- The proof must not use the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut the second is a constraint on the method, not an assumption about the groups. However, following the example where the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, perhaps here the user wants to list the proof constraint as an assumption. That might not be accurate, but to follow the example, maybe that's how it should be structured.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem line should include both the countability and the method constraint, with the assumption being the groups are compact Lie. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many isomorphism classes without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut in the example, the problem line was just \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91,\" and the assumptions were on n. So here, the problem line would be \"Prove that there are countably many isomorphism classes of compact Lie groups,\" and the assumptions would include that the groups are compact Lie, and the proof doesn't use the classification. But that seems mixing object assumptions and method constraints.\n\nThis is a bit confusing due to the example's inconsistency. However, given the user's instruction, I'll proceed to list the assumptions as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups,\nIsomorphism classes are considered,\nThe proof does not use the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many isomorphism classes.\n\nBut this might not be correct because the problem is to prove countability under a proof constraint. Alternatively, the problem line should include the constraint. Given the example's structure, where the problem line includes the main claim and the assumptions list the conditions, including any constraints on variables or objects, here the constraint is on the proof method. However, the example's assumption included a condition on n that wasn't part of the original problem (n divisible by 7), which suggests that the user might allow including such constraints as assumptions even if they are part of the proof method.\n\nAlternatively, the problem line should include the constraint, and the assumptions are about the groups. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many isomorphism classes without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nThis seems more accurate. The assumption is about the groups being compact Lie, and the problem includes both the countability and the proof constraint. The example had the problem line as \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91,\" with assumptions on n. Similarly here, the problem line includes the main claim and the constraint, while the assumption is on the groups.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe groups considered are compact Lie groups.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are countably many isomorphism classes without appealing to the classification of simple Lie algebras.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions isomorphism classes, so maybe that's part of the problem statement. The assumption is just that the groups are compact Lie. The problem is to prove countability of their isomorphism classes without using the classification.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The example's assumptions were on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7), and the problem line was the main claim. Here, the assumption is on the groups (they are compact Lie), and the problem line is to prove countability of isomorphism classes under a proof constraint.",
