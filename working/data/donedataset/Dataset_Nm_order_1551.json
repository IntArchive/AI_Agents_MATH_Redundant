Zucker,\n  SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis 15 (1984), 406-413, DOI 10.1137/0515031 .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the infinite sum of 1 over (2n+1) times hyperbolic sine of (2n+1)π equals log(2)/8. They mentioned that both sides agree numerically to 100 digits, so the identity is likely true. But how to approach proving it?\n\nFirst, I recall that hyperbolic sine functions often show up in series related to elliptic functions or theta functions. Maybe there's a connection here. The sum is over odd integers (2n+1), which makes me think of Fourier series expansions or maybe the Mittag-Leffler expansion for hyperbolic functions. Alternatively, since sinh is involved, perhaps using partial fractions or some integral representation?\n\nLet me write down the sum: Σ [1/((2n+1) sinh((2n+1)π))] from n=0 to ∞. The sinh term is exponential in nature, sinh(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2. So sinh((2n+1)π) = [e^{(2n+1)π} - e^{-(2n+1)π}]/2. Since (2n+1)π is positive and large for n ≥ 0, the term e^{-(2n+1)π} is very small, so sinh((2n+1)π) ≈ e^{(2n+1)π}/2. But maybe the exact expression is needed here.\n\nWait, but even if I approximate sinh, the sum becomes roughly Σ [2/( (2n+1) e^{(2n+1)π} )]. But that's just an approximation. However, the exact value is supposed to be log(2)/8, which is a simple constant. So there must be a clever way to sum this series exactly.\n\nLooking for similar series. I remember that some infinite series involving hyperbolic functions can be evaluated using residue theorems or Poisson summation formulas. Alternatively, maybe using the properties of the Riemann zeta function or Dirichlet series? But this sum isn't a standard zeta function.\n\nAlternatively, consider Fourier series. For example, there are known expansions for functions in terms of sinh terms. Maybe integrating a function over a period and relating it to the sum? Or perhaps using the inverse Laplace transform?\n\nAnother thought: since the sum is over odd integers, perhaps using a Fourier series expansion of a function with period 2, or related to the Dirichlet lambda function, which sums over odd integers. The lambda function is λ(s) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(2n+1)^s = (1 - 2^{-s})ζ(s). But here we have an extra sinh term in the denominator, complicating things.\n\nWait, maybe consider the integral representation of 1/sinh. Since 1/sinh(z) can be expressed as 2/(e^z - e^{-z}) = 2e^{-z}/(1 - e^{-2z}) = 2e^{-z} Σ_{k=0}^∞ e^{-2k z}, which converges for Re(z) > 0. So maybe substituting this into the sum:\n\nΣ_{n=0}^∞ [1/((2n+1)) * 2e^{-(2n+1)π} / (1 - e^{-2(2n+1)π})]\n\nBut 1/(1 - e^{-2(2n+1)π}) is a geometric series, so expanding it:\n\nΣ_{n=0}^∞ [2/(2n+1) * e^{-(2n+1)π} Σ_{k=0}^∞ e^{-2k(2n+1)π} ]\n\nThen swapping the sums (if allowed):\n\n2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ Σ_{n=0}^∞ [e^{-(2n+1)π(2k +1)} / (2n+1)]\n\nSo it becomes 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ Σ_{n=0}^∞ [e^{-(2k+1)(2n+1)π} / (2n+1)]\n\nBut now, the inner sum over n is Σ_{n=0}^\\infty [e^{-(2k+1)(2n+1)π} / (2n+1)]. Let me denote m = 2n+1, so m runs over odd integers starting from 1. Then the inner sum is Σ_{m odd} e^{-(2k+1)m π} / m.\n\nBut Σ_{m odd} e^{-a m}/m = (1/2) [Σ_{m=1}^∞ e^{-a m}/m - Σ_{m even} e^{-a m}/m] = (1/2)[ -ln(1 - e^{-a}) - (-ln(1 - e^{-2a})/2 ) ]? Wait, let's verify:\n\nThe sum over all m ≥1: Σ_{m=1}^∞ e^{-a m}/m = -ln(1 - e^{-a})\n\nThe sum over even m: Σ_{m=1}^∞ e^{-a (2m)}/(2m) = (1/2) Σ_{m=1}^∞ e^{-2a m}/m = (1/2)( -ln(1 - e^{-2a}) )\n\nTherefore, the sum over odd m is:\n\nΣ_{m odd} e^{-a m}/m = Σ_{m=1}^∞ e^{-a m}/m - Σ_{m even} e^{-a m}/m = -ln(1 - e^{-a}) - (1/2)( -ln(1 - e^{-2a}) ) = -ln(1 - e^{-a}) + (1/2)ln(1 - e^{-2a})\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -ln(1 - e^{-a}) + (1/2)ln((1 - e^{-a})(1 + e^{-a})) )\n\n= -ln(1 - e^{-a}) + (1/2)[ln(1 - e^{-a}) + ln(1 + e^{-a})]\n\n= (-1 + 1/2)ln(1 - e^{-a}) + (1/2)ln(1 + e^{-a})\n\n= (-1/2)ln(1 - e^{-a}) + (1/2)ln(1 + e^{-a})\n\n= (1/2)[ln(1 + e^{-a}) - ln(1 - e^{-a})]\n\n= (1/2) ln[(1 + e^{-a})/(1 - e^{-a})]\n\n= (1/2) ln[(e^{a/2} + e^{-a/2})/(e^{a/2} - e^{-a/2})] * e^{a/2}/e^{a/2}\n\nWait, alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by e^{a}:\n\n(1 + e^{-a})/(1 - e^{-a}) = (e^{a} + 1)/(e^{a} - 1) = [ (e^{a/2} + e^{-a/2}) / (e^{a/2} - e^{-a/2}) ]^2 ?\n\nWait, (e^{a} + 1)/(e^{a} -1) = [e^{a/2}]^2 + 1 / [e^{a/2}]^2 -1 = not exactly. Wait, (e^{a} +1) = e^{a} -1 + 2, so maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, notice that (1 + e^{-a})/(1 - e^{-a}) = coth(a/2). Because:\n\ncoth(a/2) = (e^{a/2} + e^{-a/2})/(e^{a/2} - e^{-a/2}) ) = [ (e^{a} +1 ) / (e^{a} -1 ) ]^{1/2} }?\n\nWait, perhaps more straightforward:\n\n(1 + e^{-a})/(1 - e^{-a}) = [ (e^{a} +1 ) / e^{a} ] / [ (e^{a} -1 ) / e^{a} ] = (e^{a} +1)/(e^{a} -1) = coth(a/2) +1 ? Wait, no. Let me recall that coth(a/2) = (e^{a} +1)/(e^{a} -1). Yes, exactly. Because:\n\ncoth(x) = (e^{x} + e^{-x})/(e^{x} - e^{-x}) = (e^{2x} +1)/(e^{2x} -1). So if we set x = a/2, then coth(a/2) = (e^{a} +1)/(e^{a} -1).\n\nTherefore, (1 + e^{-a})/(1 - e^{-a}) = e^{a}*(1 + e^{-a}) / [e^{a}*(1 - e^{-a})] = (e^{a} +1)/(e^{a} -1) = coth(a/2).\n\nTherefore, the sum over odd m is (1/2) ln[coth(a/2)].\n\nSo going back, in our case, a = (2k +1)π. So:\n\nΣ_{m odd} e^{-(2k+1)π m}/m = (1/2) ln[coth( (2k +1)π /2 ) ]\n\nBut coth( (2k +1)π /2 ) is a hyperbolic cotangent of a multiple of π/2. Let's compute it:\n\ncoth( (2k +1)π /2 ) = [ e^{(2k+1)π/2} + e^{-(2k+1)π/2} ] / [ e^{(2k+1)π/2} - e^{-(2k+1)π/2} ]\n\nBut for integer k ≥0, (2k+1)π/2 is (k + 0.5)π. The coth of (k + 0.5)π. But coth( (k + 0.5)π ) is equal to 1/tanh( (k + 0.5)π ). However, tanh( (k + 0.5)π ) approaches 1 as k increases, so coth( (k + 0.5)π ) approaches 1. But for specific k, perhaps we can compute exact values?\n\nWait, for k=0: coth(π/2). There's no standard simplification for coth(π/2), but maybe using some elliptic function properties? Alternatively, perhaps there's a product formula or identity that can relate these terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is not the right way. Let me think of another method.\n\nThe original sum is S = Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/[(2n+1) sinh((2n+1)π)].\n\nGiven that sinh(mπ) = (e^{mπ} - e^{-mπ})/2, so sinh((2n+1)π) = [e^{(2n+1)π} - e^{-(2n+1)π}]/2 ≈ e^{(2n+1)π}/2 for large n. So the terms decay exponentially, which explains why the series converges.\n\nBut how to sum it?\n\nMaybe consider the sum S = Σ_{n=0}^\\infty [2 / ( (2n+1)(e^{(2n+1)π} - e^{-(2n+1)π}) ) ]\n\n= 2 Σ_{n=0}^\\infty [1 / ( (2n+1)(e^{(2n+1)π} (1 - e^{-2(2n+1)π}) ) ]\n\n= 2 Σ_{n=0}^\\infty [ e^{-(2n+1)π} / ( (2n+1)(1 - e^{-2(2n+1)π}) ) ]\n\nThen, expanding 1/(1 - e^{-2(2n+1)π}) as a geometric series:\n\n= 2 Σ_{n=0}^\\infty Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ e^{-(2n+1)π(2k +1)} / (2n+1) ]\n\nInterchange the sums (assuming convergence allows):\n\n= 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty Σ_{n=0}^\\infty [ e^{-(2k +1)(2n +1)π} / (2n +1) ]\n\nLet me denote m = 2n +1, so n = (m -1)/2, but m runs over odd integers 1,3,5,... Then,\n\n= 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty Σ_{m=1, odd}^\\infty [ e^{-(2k +1)m π} / m ]\n\nBut this is similar to the earlier approach. Then, we have:\n\n= 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ Σ_{m=1, odd}^\\infty e^{-(2k +1)m π} / m ]\n\nAs before, Σ_{m odd} e^{-am}/m = (1/2) ln( (1 + e^{-a}) / (1 - e^{-a}) )\n\nSo here, a = (2k +1)π, so:\n\n= 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ (1/2) ln( (1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) / (1 - e^{-(2k +1)π}) ) ]\n\n= Σ_{k=0}^\\infty ln( (1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) / (1 - e^{-(2k +1)π}) )\n\n= Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ ln(1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) - ln(1 - e^{-(2k +1)π}) ]\n\nThis becomes:\n\nΣ_{k=0}^\\infty ln(1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) - Σ_{k=0}^\\infty ln(1 - e^{-(2k +1)π})\n\nBut each of these sums can be written as product expansions, since Σ ln(1 ± x^k) = ln Π(1 ± x^k). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\nln [ Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) ] - ln [ Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 - e^{-(2k +1)π}) ]\n\n= ln [ Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) / (1 - e^{-(2k +1)π}) ]\n\nBut this product might relate to some known theta function or modular form. The product Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) is similar to a product over odd exponents. Maybe there's a connection with the Jacobi theta functions?\n\nRecall that theta functions have product representations. For example, the Jacobi theta function ϑ_4(z, q) = Π_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - q^{2n})(1 - 2q^{2n-1} cos 2z + q^{4n-2}) ). But I'm not sure if this directly helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + x^{2k+1}) is known in q-series, but here x is e^{-π}, and we have a ratio of products. Wait, the ratio would be Π (1 + x^{2k+1}) / (1 - x^{2k+1}) ), where x = e^{-π}.\n\nThis ratio is equal to Π (1 + x^{2k+1}) / (1 - x^{2k+1}) ) = Π [ (1 - x^{4k+2}) / (1 - x^{2k+1})^2 } ] ??? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that (1 + x^{2k+1}) / (1 - x^{2k+1}) ) = (1 + x^{2k+1}) / (1 - x^{2k+1}) = [1/(1 - x^{2k+1}) ] * (1 + x^{2k+1}) = [1 + x^{2k+1}]/[1 - x^{2k+1}] = 1 + 2x^{2k+1}/(1 - x^{2k+1})\n\nBut this might not be helpful. Let me consider specific values. Here, x = e^{-π} ≈ 0.0432, which is a small number. So the products converge quickly. But the problem is to relate this product to log(2)/8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a known identity for this product. Alternatively, consider taking the logarithm of the product ratio, which is the sum we have:\n\nΣ_{k=0}^\\infty [ ln(1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) - ln(1 - e^{-(2k +1)π}) ]\n\nBut each term can be expanded using Taylor series for ln(1 ± y). For small y, ln(1 + y) ≈ y - y^2/2 + y^3/3 - ..., and ln(1 - y) ≈ -y - y^2/2 - y^3/3 - ..., so ln(1 + y) - ln(1 - y) ≈ 2(y + y^3/3 + y^5/5 + ... ). For y = e^{-(2k +1)π}, which is very small, since e^{-π} ≈ 0.043, so even for k=0, y=e^{-π}≈0.043, and higher k makes it much smaller. So the difference ln(1 + y) - ln(1 - y) ≈ 2y + (2/3)y^3 + ... So the sum S ≈ 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty e^{-(2k +1)π} + (2/3) Σ_{k=0}^\\infty e^{-3(2k +1)π} + ... But given that e^{-π} is small, maybe the first term is dominant. However, the exact sum is supposed to be log(2)/8 ≈ 0.0866, while 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty e^{-(2k +1)π} = 2 e^{-π}/(1 - e^{-2π}) ) ≈ 2 * 0.0432 / (1 - 0.00187) ≈ 0.0864 / 0.998 ≈ 0.0866, which matches the given value. Wait, that's interesting. So the first term in the expansion already gives log(2)/8. So maybe the higher-order terms are negligible, but since the problem states that both sides agree to 100 digits, this suggests that the entire sum S is exactly equal to log(2)/8, which numerically matches the first term. Therefore, perhaps there's an identity where the entire sum equals the first term of the expansion, but why?\n\nWait, this seems confusing. If I approximate S ≈ 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty e^{-(2k +1)π}, and that sum is a geometric series:\n\nΣ_{k=0}^\\infty e^{-(2k +1)π} = e^{-π} Σ_{k=0}^\\infty e^{-2π k} = e^{-π}/(1 - e^{-2π}) = 1/(e^{π} - e^{-π}) = 1/(2 sinh π)\n\nThus, 2 * [1/(2 sinh π)] = 1/sinh π ≈ 0.0866. But 1/sinh π ≈ 1/11.5487 ≈ 0.0866, which is log(2)/8 ≈ 0.086643397... So they are equal up to that decimal. Therefore, the sum S is equal to 1/sinh π. But wait, the original problem states that S = log(2)/8. But 1/sinh π ≈ 0.0866 and log(2)/8 ≈ 0.086643397..., which are almost equal. Wait, are they exactly equal?\n\nLet me compute sinh π:\n\nπ ≈ 3.1415926535\n\nsinh π = (e^π - e^{-π})/2 ≈ (23.14069263 - 0.043213918)/2 ≈ (23.09747871)/2 ≈ 11.54873935\n\nSo 1/sinh π ≈ 1/11.54873935 ≈ 0.08658. However, log(2)/8 ≈ 0.69314718056/8 ≈ 0.0866433976. These are close but not exactly equal. However, the user said they agree to 100 digits. Therefore, my approximation must be missing something. Therefore, the previous approach where the sum S is approximated by the first term is insufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an exact identity here. Let me recall that sums of this form sometimes relate to elliptic integrals or theta functions. For example, there are formulas for sums involving 1/( (2n+1) sinh( (2n+1)π ) ).\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral of some function which generates these terms. For example, since 1/sinh(a) = 2/(e^a - e^{-a}) = 2e^{-a}/(1 - e^{-2a}) = 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty e^{-(2k +1)a}. So 1/( (2n+1) sinh( (2n+1)π ) ) = (2/(2n+1)) Σ_{k=0}^\\infty e^{-(2k +1)(2n+1)π}. Then, swapping sums:\n\nS = 2 Σ_{n=0}^\\infty Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ e^{-(2k +1)(2n+1)π} / (2n+1) ]\n\nLet me change variables: Let m = 2n+1, which runs over odd integers 1,3,5..., and l = k, so:\n\nS = 2 Σ_{m odd} Σ_{l=0}^\\infty [ e^{-(2l +1)m π} / m ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nS = 2 Σ_{l=0}^\\infty Σ_{m odd} [ e^{-(2l +1)m π} / m ]\n\nThen, for each l, we have Σ_{m odd} e^{-am}/m, where a = (2l +1)π. As before, this sum is (1/2) ln( (1 + e^{-a}) / (1 - e^{-a}) ). So:\n\nS = 2 Σ_{l=0}^\\infty [ (1/2) ln( (1 + e^{- (2l +1)π}) / (1 - e^{- (2l +1)π}) ) ]\n\n= Σ_{l=0}^\\infty ln( (1 + e^{- (2l +1)π}) / (1 - e^{- (2l +1)π}) )\n\nNow, this product telescopes or relates to some known product formula? Alternatively, consider that the terms in the product might relate to the Jacobi theta functions. Theta functions often have product representations involving terms like (1 - q^{2n}), etc. But I need to find a connection between this sum and log(2)/8.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the infinite product Π_{l=0}^\\infty (1 + e^{- (2l +1)π}) / (1 - e^{- (2l +1)π}) ) equals e^{log(2)/8}? If S = log(2)/8, then the sum of logs would be log( log(2)/8 ), which doesn't align. Wait, no, S is the sum of the logs, which equals the log of the product. So:\n\nS = log [ Π_{l=0}^\\infty (1 + e^{- (2l +1)π}) / (1 - e^{- (2l +1)π}) ) ]\n\nBut if this product equals 2^{1/8}, then log(2^{1/8}) = (1/8) log 2, which matches the desired result. Therefore, if Π_{l=0}^\\infty (1 + e^{- (2l +1)π}) / (1 - e^{- (2l +1)π}) ) = 2^{1/8}, then S = log(2)/8.\n\nBut why would that product equal 2^{1/8}? This seems to require a known identity. Alternatively, consider special values of modular forms. Given that π appears in the exponent, and the product involves terms e^{- (2l +1)π}, this might be related to the Ramanujan theta functions or some modular identity.\n\nRecall that the Rogers-Ramanujan identities and similar products are related to q-series with q = e^{-π} or other values. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider the value of the Dedekind eta function. The eta function is defined as η(τ) = e^{π i τ /12} Π_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - e^{2π i n τ} ). But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.\n\nAlternatively, recall that when τ = i, then q = e^{-2π}, and certain product formulas might simplify. For example, the eta function at τ = i is η(i) = ... But this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, consider the identity from the theory of elliptic functions. The sum in question resembles the sum over poles or zeros of an elliptic function, but I don't recall the exact connection.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sum as related to the Lambert series. A Lambert series is of the form Σ_{n=1}^\\infty a_n (q^n)/(1 - q^n}), but this isn't exactly the same.\n\nWait, another idea: use the identity that sum_{n odd} 1/(n sinh(nπ)) = log(2)/8. But I need a reference or a way to derive this.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral of a function that generates the terms 1/((2n+1) sinh((2n+1)π)). For example, integrate term-by-term.\n\nSuppose we write S = Σ_{n=0}^\\infty [1/( (2n+1) sinh((2n+1)π) ) ]\n\nNotice that 1/sinh(x) = 2/(e^x - e^{-x}) = 2e^{-x}/(1 - e^{-2x}) = 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty e^{-(2k+1)x}\n\nTherefore, S = 2 Σ_{n=0}^\\infty Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ e^{-(2k+1)(2n+1)π} / (2n+1) ]\n\nThen, swapping the sums (if justified):\n\nS = 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty Σ_{n=0}^\\infty [ e^{-(2k+1)(2n+1)π} / (2n+1) ]\n\nLet’s denote m = 2n+1, so m is odd, and n = (m-1)/2. Then,\n\nS = 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty Σ_{m=1, odd}^\\infty [ e^{-(2k+1)mπ} / m ]\n\nBut Σ_{m=1, odd}^\\infty e^{-am}/m = (1/2) ln( (1 + e^{-a}) / (1 - e^{-a}) ) as before. Here, a = (2k +1)π. Therefore,\n\nS = 2 Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ (1/2) ln( (1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) / (1 - e^{-(2k +1)π}) ) ]\n\n= Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ ln(1 + e^{-(2k +1)π}) - ln(1 - e^{-(2k +1)π}) ]\n\nAs established earlier. Now, if we can show that this infinite sum equals log(2)/8, then we're done.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider the case when k=0: ln( (1 + e^{-π}) / (1 - e^{-π}) ) = ln( coth(π/2) ). Similarly, for k=1: ln( (1 + e^{-3π}) / (1 - e^{-3π}) ) = ln( coth(3π/2) ), etc. So the sum is Σ_{k=0}^\\infty ln( coth( (2k +1)π/2 ) )\n\nBut coth( (2k +1)π/2 ) = [ e^{(2k +1)π/2} + e^{- (2k +1)π/2} ] / [ e^{(2k +1)π/2} - e^{- (2k +1)π/2} ] = [ e^{(2k +1)π} +1 ] / [ e^{(2k +1)π} -1 ].\n\nTherefore, ln( coth( (2k +1)π/2 ) ) = ln( (e^{(2k +1)π} +1 ) / (e^{(2k +1)π} -1 ) )\n\n= ln(1 + e^{- (2k +1)π}) - ln(1 - e^{- (2k +1)π})\n\nWhich matches our previous expression. Therefore, S = Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ ln(1 + e^{- (2k +1)π}) - ln(1 - e^{- (2k +1)π}) ]\n\nBut again, how to sum this?\n\nPerhaps notice that each term is the difference of logs, and the sum telescopes? Unlikely, since each term is exponentially decaying. Alternatively, recognize that the sum S is related to the integral of a certain function.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum S can be written as the difference between two Lambert series:\n\nΣ_{k=0}^\\infty ln(1 + e^{- (2k +1)π}) = Σ_{k=0}^\\infty Σ_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m+1} e^{- m (2k +1)π } / m\n\nSimilarly for the other term. But this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following identity: for q = e^{-π}, the sum S is:\n\nS = Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [ ln(1 + q^{2k +1}) - ln(1 - q^{2k +1}) ]\n\n= Σ_{k=0}^\\infty ln( (1 + q^{2k +1}) / (1 - q^{2k +1}) )\n\n= ln [ Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + q^{2k +1}) / (1 - q^{2k +1}) ) ]\n\nThis product is known in the theory of partitions. In particular, the product Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + q^{2k +1}) is the generating function for partitions into distinct odd parts, and Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 - q^{2k +1})^{-1} is the generating function for partitions into odd parts. Therefore, their ratio is the generating function for partitions into distinct odd parts divided by partitions into odd parts. However, I don't see how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, there's an identity related to the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction or other q-series identities. For example, the product Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + q^{2k +1}) / (1 - q^{2k +1}) ) might have a closed form when q = e^{-π}.\n\nBut I don't recall such an identity. However, since q = e^{-π} is a specific value related to elliptic integrals. Recall that theta functions at certain points relate to values of elliptic integrals and modular functions.\n\nAlternatively, consider the transformation formulas for theta functions under τ → -1/τ. But this might be a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the sum S is related to the derivative of some theta function at a specific point. But without more knowledge, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, look for a connection with the Riemann zeta function. But the terms involve exponentials of π times integers, which doesn't directly relate to zeta values.\n\nAlternatively, consider numerical evaluation. The user says both sides agree to 100 digits, so there must be a sophisticated proof involving advanced mathematical tools.\n\nPerhaps a more fruitful approach is to recall that sums of this nature often appear in the context of solutions to Laplace's equation in certain geometries, and the sum represents a potential or a Green's function. Alternatively, in conformal field theory or string theory, such sums can emerge from partition functions.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following identity from complex analysis. Suppose we consider a function f(z) with poles at z = (2n+1)πi for integers n, and then integrate it over a contour, using residue theorem. But this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider the partial fraction expansion of hyperbolic functions. For example, sinh(z) has zeros at z = nπi, so maybe using Mittag-Leffler expansion. The Mittag-Leffler theorem states that meromorphic functions can be expressed in terms of their poles. For 1/sinh(z), the expansion is 1/sinh(z) = 1/z + Σ_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n (2z)/(z^2 + (nπ)^2). But I don't see how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating a suitable function. For example, consider integrating a function involving log terms over a suitable contour to pick up the residues related to the sum.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the sum S can be related to the imaginary part of some complex integral. But without a concrete example, this is too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for similar known sums. A quick search in my memory: there's a formula similar to Σ_{n=0}^\\infty [1/( (2n+1) sinh((2n+1)π/2) ] = π/16. But that's different from our case. Alternatively, in Borwein's books on pi and the AGM, there are sums involving hyperbolic functions.\n\nAlternatively, consider the identity involving the sum over n of 1/(n^3 sinh(nπ)) = something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the Chowla-Selberg formula, which relates sums over lattices to products involving eta functions. But I don't recall the exact connection.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + e^{- (2k +1)π}) / (1 - e^{- (2k +1)π}) ) could be expressed as e^{S}, but S is supposed to be log(2)/8, so the product is e^{log(2)/8} = 2^{1/8}. Therefore, if we can show that the product equals 2^{1/8}, then S = log(2)/8.\n\nBut why would the product equal 2^{1/8}? This seems to require an identity from number theory or modular forms. Let me recall that when q = e^{-π}, certain products related to theta functions equal simple expressions. For example, the product Π_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - q^{2n}) is related to the theta function θ_4(0, q). But I need to connect it to our product.\n\nAlternatively, recall that Ramanujan's theta functions have product representations. For example, φ(q) = Π_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - q^{2n}) / (1 + q^{2n})^2. But this doesn't directly help.\n\nAlternatively, use the Jacobi triple product identity. The triple product identity states that:\n\nΣ_{n=-∞}^\\infty q^{n^2} z^n = Π_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - q^{2n})(1 + q^{2n-1}z)(1 + q^{2n-1}/z)\n\nSetting z = 1, we get:\n\nΣ_{n=-∞}^\\infty q^{n^2} = Π_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - q^{2n})(1 + q^{2n-1})^2\n\nBut this also doesn't directly help.\n\nAlternatively, consider that our product Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + q^{2k +1}) / (1 - q^{2k +1}) with q = e^{-π} equals 2^{1/8}.\n\nThis seems plausible only if there's a hidden symmetry or identity when q = e^{-π}. For example, in the theory of modular forms, certain modular functions take simple values at specific points. For instance, when τ = i, then q = e^{-π}, and some functions have known values. \n\nIn particular, the Dedekind eta function η(τ) = q^{1/24} Π_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - q^n), where q = e^{2πiτ}. For τ = i, q = e^{-2π}. But in our case, q = e^{-π}, which corresponds to τ = i/2. \n\nThe eta function at τ = i/2: η(i/2) = e^{-π/12} Π_{n=1}^\\infty (1 - e^{-2π n}). \n\nBut our product is Π_{k=0}^\\infty (1 + e^{- (2k +1)π}) / (1 - e^{- (2k +1)π}) ) = Π_{m odd} (1 + e^{-mπ}) / (1 - e^{-mπ}) )\n\nThis can be rewritten as Π_{m odd} [ (1 + e^{-mπ}) / (1 - e^{-mπ}) ) ] = Π_{m odd} [ (1 - e^{-2mπ})^{-1} (1 + e^{-mπ})^2 ]\n\nBut (1 + e^{-mπ}) / (1 - e^{-mπ}) = [ (1 - e^{-2mπ})^{-1} (1 + e^{-mπ})^2 ]\n\nWait, no: (1 + e^{-mπ}) / (1 - e^{-mπ}) = (1 + e^{-mπ}) / (1 - e^{-mπ}) = [ (1 - e^{-2mπ}) / (1 - e^{-mπ})^2 ]^{-1} ??? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, notice that:\n\nΠ_{m odd} (1 + e^{-mπ}) / (1 - e^{-mπ}) = Π_{m odd} [1 + 2/(e^{mπ} -1)]\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the product Π_{m odd} (1 + e^{-mπ}) / (1 - e^{-mπ}) is equal to 2^{1/8} by some identity. If this is true, then S = log(2)/8. But how to prove it?\n\nI think this requires referencing advanced mathematical literature or known identities. Since I don't have access to that, but given that the numerical value matches to 100 digits, it's likely that such an identity exists. Therefore, the key assumption is that this product telescopes or relates to a simple exponential via some modular identity, leading to S = log(2)/8.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following approach from complex analysis: consider a function f(z) whose residues at z = (2n+1)πi contribute to the sum. But constructing such a function is non-trivial.\n\nAlternatively, use the Poisson summation formula. The Poisson formula relates a sum over integers to a sum over their Fourier transforms. But applying it here would require careful setup.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a concrete path, I think the answer hinges on recognizing an advanced identity involving products of exponentials that equate to 2^{1/8}, leading to S = log(2)/8. Therefore, the formatted problem should include the necessary assumptions, which in this case are that the sum is over all non-negative integers n, each term involves hyperbolic sine of odd multiples of π, and the sum equals log(2)/8.",
