    "Content": "Let $GL_n(k)$ be the $n$ by $n$ general linear group over $k$ , $B_n(k)$ be the subgroup of $GL_n(k)$ consisting of all upper triangular matrices, and $U_n(k)$ be the subgroup of $B_n(k)$ whose diagonal elements are all $1$ . To show $B_n(k)$ is solvable, I'm proving it now by following steps: $U_n(k)$ is a subgroup of $B_n(k)$ . (done) $U_n(k)$ is normal in $B_n(k)$ . (done) $U_n(k)$ is solvable. (question) $B_n(k) / U_n(k)$ is also solvable. (not yet) $B_n(k)$ is solvable. (by the below thm) I'll use a theorem to verify $B_n(k)$ is solvable. $G$ is solvable if and only if $H$ and $G/H$ are solvable for some normal subgroup $H$ of $G$ . So, I have to prove both step 3 and step 4. But I have no idea about them. How to prove them? Since my knowledge is not enough, I don't want to show them using Lie theory. Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $A$ is an $n\\times n$ matrix, I call the entries $a_{i,i+\\ell}$ of $A$ the $\\ell$ -th diagonal of $A$ . In particular, the $0$ -th diagonal of $A$ is its actual diagonal. You can prove that if $A,B \\in U_n(k)$ and $C = [A,B]$ then the first diagonal of $C$ is $0$ . More in general, if the first $\\ell$ diagonals (except the $0$ -th) of $A$ are $0$ and the first $m$ diagonals (except the $0$ -th) of $B$ are $0$ , then the first $\\ell+m+1$ diagonals of $[A,B]$ are $0$ . In order to prove the statement about the quotient, you can observe that $B_n/U_n$ is indeed isomorphic to the group of diagonal matrices.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show that the group B_n(k) of upper triangular matrices is solvable. They've already established that U_n(k), the subgroup of unit upper triangular matrices (those with 1s on the diagonal), is normal in B_n(k). Now they need to show that both U_n(k) and B_n(k)/U_n(k) are solvable. \n\nFirst, for step 3: Proving U_n(k) is solvable. I remember that solvable groups have a derived series that terminates in the trivial group. For matrix groups like U_n(k), which are nilpotent in the case of finite fields, maybe they are also solvable. Wait, but nilpotent implies solvable, right? So if U_n(k) is nilpotent, then it's solvable. But is U_n(k) nilpotent? In general, the group of upper triangular matrices with 1s on the diagonal is called the unipotent radical, and in algebraic groups, unipotent radical is nilpotent. So perhaps U_n(k) is nilpotent, hence solvable. But maybe this is using Lie theory, which the user wants to avoid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe construct the derived series directly. For U_n(k), the commutator subgroup might be a subgroup of matrices with more zeros. For example, in U_3(k), the commutator [U,U] would consist of matrices with 1s on the diagonal, 0s in the first superdiagonal, and arbitrary entries in the higher diagonals. Then taking successive commutators would eventually reduce to the trivial group. So the derived series terminates, hence U_n(k) is solvable. But how to explain this without Lie theory?\n\nFor step 4: B_n(k)/U_n(k) is solvable. The quotient B_n(k)/U_n(k) is isomorphic to the group of diagonal matrices, right? Because B_n(k) consists of upper triangular matrices, and modding out by U_n(k) would make all the off-diagonal entries irrelevant, leaving only the diagonal entries. The group of diagonal matrices in GL_n(k) is abelian (since diagonal matrices commute if their entries are multiplied component-wise, though wait, actually diagonal matrices do commute under multiplication, right? Because multiplying two diagonal matrices just multiplies their corresponding diagonal entries. So the group of invertible diagonal matrices is abelian. Abelian groups are solvable since their derived subgroup is trivial. Therefore, B_n(k)/U_n(k) is abelian, hence solvable.\n\nSo putting it together: Since U_n(k) is solvable (as a nilpotent group) and B_n(k)/U_n(k) is abelian (hence solvable), then by the theorem that if G has a normal subgroup H such that H and G/H are solvable, then G is solvable, it follows that B_n(k) is solvable.\n\nBut the user might need more concrete steps. For U_n(k), perhaps they can use induction on n. For example, in U_n(k), consider the series where each subgroup consists of matrices with zeros in the first superdiagonal, then the next, etc. Each quotient in this series is abelian. So this gives a normal series with abelian quotients, hence U_n(k) is solvable. Alternatively, the lower central series terminates, showing nilpotency, hence solvability.\n\nAlternatively, another approach for U_n(k): The group U_n(k) can be written as a product of root subgroups, each corresponding to positions above the diagonal. These root subgroups are abelian, and the commutator of two root subgroups is in a higher root subgroup. So by taking successive commutators, the derived series eventually becomes trivial. This might be a way to see it, but again, perhaps this is too Lie-theoretic.\n\nBut maybe in the specific case, for matrices, the commutator [U_n(k), U_n(k)] is contained in the subgroup with first superdiagonal zero, and so on. Each step of the derived series reduces the number of non-zero diagonals until you reach the trivial group. So U_n(k) is solvable. Similarly, for the quotient being abelian.\n\nSo the assumptions would involve the structure of B_n(k) and U_n(k), their normality, and the properties of their quotients. The problem is to prove that U_n(k) is solvable and that B_n(k)/U_n(k) is solvable. Then apply the theorem to conclude B_n(k) is solvable.\n\nNow, translating that into the required format. The user's original question is to structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. The example given lists each assumption line by line. Let's parse the original question.\n\nOriginal problem components:\n- B_n(k) is a subgroup of GL_n(k) consisting of upper triangular matrices.\n- U_n(k) is a subgroup of B_n(k) with diagonal elements 1.\n- The user has already shown that U_n(k) is a normal subgroup of B_n(k).\n- Need to show U_n(k) is solvable (step 3).\n- Need to show B_n(k)/U_n(k) is solvable (step 4).\n- Then by the theorem, B_n(k) is solvable.\n\nAssumptions to list: Each assumption about the objects involved. For example:\n- U_n(k) is a subgroup of B_n(k).\n- U_n(k) is normal in B_n(k).\n- The theorem that if G has a normal subgroup H with H and G/H solvable, then G is solvable.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were about the properties of the objects in the problem. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $U_n(k)$ is a subgroup of $B_n(k)$,\n- $U_n(k)$ is a normal subgroup of $B_n(k)$,\n- If a group $G$ has a normal subgroup $H$ such that $H$ and $G/H$ are solvable, then $G$ is solvable.\n\nProblem: Prove that $U_n(k)$ is solvable and $B_n(k)/U_n(k)$ is solvable.\n\nBut the original problem's question is \"Why is the group of unit upper triangular matrices solvable?\" but in the context of the steps the user is taking, the problem is to prove steps 3 and 4, i.e., that U_n(k) is solvable and B_n(k)/U_n(k) is solvable. The title is about why the unit upper triangular matrices are solvable, but the actual problem in the question is proving steps 3 and 4. However, the user might be conflating two things: they need to show B_n(k) is solvable by showing U_n(k) and B_n(k)/U_n(k) are solvable. So the problem as per the user's description is to prove steps 3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions (existing conditions) and then state the problem as proving those two steps.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumption section lists the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which were part of the problem statement. In the current case, the user has already established that U_n(k) is a subgroup and normal, and the theorem is given. So the assumptions would include:\n\n- $U_n(k)$ is a subgroup of $B_n(k)$,\n- $U_n(k)$ is normal in $B_n(k)$,\n- The theorem that G is solvable iff H and G/H are solvable for some normal H.\n\nBut wait, the theorem is a general theorem, not an assumption specific to the problem. The user is using it in their steps. The problem's assumptions would be the given conditions that the user has already established. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $U_n(k)$ is a subgroup of $B_n(k)$,\n- $U_n(k)$ is a normal subgroup of $B_n(k)$,\n- The solvability of $B_n(k)$ can be determined by the solvability of $U_n(k)$ and $B_n(k)/U_n(k)$ (per the theorem mentioned).\n\nProblem: Prove that $U_n(k)$ is solvable and $B_n(k)/U_n(k)$ is solvable.\n\nAlternatively, since the theorem is a known result, perhaps it's not listed as an assumption but rather as part of the problem's context. The example given included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was part of the problem's hypothesis. Here, the user is asking to prove U_n(k) and the quotient are solvable, given that U_n(k) is normal in B_n(k).\n\nBut the original question's problem is: the user has done steps 1 and 2 (subgroup and normal), needs to do steps 3 and 4 (solvable for U and quotient), to conclude step 5 via the theorem. So the problem as structured would be to prove steps 3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the established facts (U is a normal subgroup), and the problem is to show U and the quotient are solvable.\n\nSo formatting:\n\nAssumption:\n- $U_n(k)$ is a subgroup of $B_n(k)$,\n- $U_n(k)$ is a normal subgroup of $B_n(k)$,\n- The theorem states that if a group $G$ has a normal subgroup $H$ where $H$ and $G/H$ are solvable, then $G$ is solvable.\n\nProblem: Prove that $U_n(k)$ is solvable and $B_n(k)/U_n(k)$ is solvable.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were only about the objects in the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7). The theorem is part of the method, not an assumption of the problem. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions should only include the given conditions about the groups:\n\nAssumption:\n- $U_n(k)$ is a subgroup of $B_n(k)$,\n- $U_n(k)$ is a normal subgroup of $B_n(k)$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $U_n(k)$ is solvable and $B_n(k)/U_n(k)$ is solvable.\n\nBecause the theorem is a tool the user is using, not an assumption of the problem itself. The problem is within the context of the steps the user has already taken, so the assumptions are the parts they've already proven (subgroup and normal), and the problem is to prove the remaining steps (solvable for U and quotient). The theorem is part of the background knowledge, not an assumption of the problem.",
