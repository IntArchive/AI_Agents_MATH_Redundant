    "AcceptedAnswer": "The idea of a mathematical proof is that without dependence of a specific input, if certain properties are true, then the conclusion is also true. In this case, if the composition is injective then it has to be that the \"outer\" function is injective, and that if the functions are surjective then their composition is as such. Showing a specific case is a valid method for disproving a claim, as it shows that at a certain time the properties hold but the conclusion is false. For example, consider $A=\\{0\\}$ and $B=\\{1,2\\}$ and $C=\\{0\\}$ and $f(0)=1$ and $g(1)=0, g(2)=0$. The composition $g\\circ f$ is a function from $A$ to $C$, since $A$ is a singleton every function is injective. However $g$ is clearly not injective. This is a counterexample to the claim, thus disproving it. The proof for the second one, if both functions are surjective then so is their composition, let us check this. Let $A,B,C$ any sets, and $f,g$ functions as required. To show that $g\\circ f$ is surjective we want to show that every element of $C$ is in the range of $g\\circ f$. Assume $c\\in C$ then there is some element $b\\in B$ such that $g(b)=c$. Since $f$ is surjective we have some $a\\in A$ such that $f(a)=b$. It follows that $g\\circ f (a) = c$ and therefore the composition of surjective functions is surjective. Now, consider this proof. There was nothing to limit ourself. I did not require anything from $A,B,C$ other than them being sets, and I did not require anything from $f,g$ other than them being functions from/onto the required set in the premise of the claim. Furthermore, I did not check the surjective-ness of the composition by choosing a certain element. I picked and arbitrary element, from a set which was also arbitrary . Using this sort of argument assures us that the property is not dependent on any of the characteristics of the set (for example, some things are only true on finite, or infinite, or other certain sets). This allows us to have a very general theorem. Whenever we have three sets, and two functions which are surjective between them, then the composition is also surjective!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user has two parts to their question: part (a) and part (b). They initially tried to prove both statements but then realized part (a) needed a counterexample. Let me parse each part carefully.\n\nStarting with part (a): If g∘f is injective, then g is injective. The user first gave a proof using specific sets and functions where both g∘f and g were injective. But then they revised it with a counterexample where A has one element, B has two, and C has one. In their counterexample, g∘f is injective because the single element in A maps to the single element in C, but g itself is not injective since both elements in B map to the same element in C. That makes sense because injectivity of the composition doesn't necessarily force g to be injective. The key here is that if the domain of f is smaller, even if g isn't injective over the entire B, the composition can still be injective if f maps to a part of B where g acts injectively on that image. So the counterexample is valid because it shows a case where the composition is injective, but g isn't.\n\nNow part (b): If f and g are surjective, then g∘f is surjective. The user tried to prove this with an example where A, B, and C are small sets. In their example, f maps both elements of A to the single element in B, and g maps that element to the single element in C. So g∘f is surjective because every element in C is covered. However, the user is now confused about whether this is a valid proof or if they need to find a counterexample. Wait, actually, the statement here is that if f and g are both surjective, then the composition is surjective. The user's example shows that when f and g are surjective, the composition is also surjective. But the problem is asking to prove or disprove the statement. The user's example supports the statement, but is that sufficient as a proof? No, because a single example doesn't prove a general statement. To prove it, you need to show that for any c in C, there exists an a in A such that g∘f(a) = c. Since g is surjective, for every c in C, there exists a b in B such that g(b) = c. Since f is surjective, for that b, there exists an a in A such that f(a) = b. Therefore, g∘f(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b) = c. Hence, the composition is surjective. So actually, the original statement in part (b) is true, and the user's example is just an instance of it, not a full proof. However, the user might have thought their example was a proof, but in reality, the general proof requires the argument I just outlined. So the user's example is correct, but it's not a proof; they need to understand the general case. However, the user is asking if their proofs (examples) are valid. For part (b), their example is valid as an example, but not as a proof. However, the actual statement is true, so the user's example is a correct instance, but the general proof is needed. Wait, but the user initially said \"Here's my proof that this is true\" using that example, which is incorrect because examples don't prove general statements. So the user's approach is flawed here. But since the actual statement is true, the user needs to provide a general proof, not just an example. However, the problem is asking to prove or disprove. Since part (b) is actually true, the user's example is not a valid proof, but the statement itself is true. So the user's answer for part (b) is incorrect because they used an example as a proof, but the statement is actually true. Therefore, the user needs to correct their approach for part (b) by providing a general proof.\n\nWait, but let me double-check part (b). If f: A → B and g: B → C are both surjective, then g∘f: A → C is surjective. This is indeed true. Because for any c in C, since g is surjective, there exists b in B such that g(b) = c. Since f is surjective, there exists a in A such that f(a) = b. Therefore, g∘f(a) = g(b) = c. Hence, the composition is surjective. Therefore, part (b) is true, and the user's example is just an example, but their method of \"proof\" is inadequate. However, in their question, they present the example as a proof, which is wrong. So their answer to part (b) is incorrect because they used an example instead of a general proof. But the problem is to prove or disprove. Since the statement is true, the user should have provided a general proof, not an example. However, the user is asking if their proofs (examples) are valid. So for part (b), their \"proof\" is invalid because it's just an example, but the statement is actually true. So they need to correct their approach.\n\nBut the user's main question is whether their proofs (the examples they gave) are valid. For part (a), their counterexample is valid. For part (b), their example supports the statement, but it's not a valid proof. However, since the statement is actually true, the user needs to understand that part (b) is true in general, and their example is just a case of it. But their method of using an example as a proof is incorrect.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n- Part (a): The user initially tried to prove it but then correctly provided a counterexample. The counterexample is valid, so the answer is that the statement is false.\n\n- Part (b): The user tried to prove it with an example, but the statement is actually true. However, the example is not a valid proof. The correct approach is a general proof.\n\nBut the user's question is asking if their proofs are valid. So for part (a), the revised counterexample is valid. For part (b), their example is not a valid proof, but the statement is true. However, the user might be confused because they presented an example as a proof, which isn't sufficient. Therefore, their answer for part (b) is invalid, but the statement itself is true, so they need to provide a proper proof.\n\nNow, the user also mentions that they are having trouble with part (b), so perhaps they are unsure whether the statement is true or false. Since part (b) is true, they need to construct a general proof, not a counterexample. But their initial attempt was an example, which isn't enough.\n\nNow, moving to structuring the problem as per the given format. The original problem is two parts:\n\na) If g∘f is injective, then g is injective. Prove or disprove.\n\nb) If f and g are surjective, then g∘f is surjective. Prove or disprove.\n\nThe user provided their attempts and is asking if their proofs (counterexamples for a, and example for b) are valid.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line and then the problem.\n\nLooking at the example given, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted version, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer, but the formatted problem in the example added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was structured incorrectly. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which is not part of the original problem. Wait, this might be an error in the example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer. However, in the formatted problem, it's adding that n is divisible by 7, which is not part of the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect. But the user wants me to follow the format where assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nBut in the given problem here, the user's question is about functions f and g with given domains and codomains. So for part (a), the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: A → B is a function.\n\n- g: B → C is a function.\n\n- g∘f is injective.\n\nProblem: Is g necessarily injective?\n\nSimilarly for part (b):\n\n- f: A → B is surjective.\n\n- g: B → C is surjective.\n\nProblem: Is g∘f necessarily surjective?\n\nBut the user is asking about both parts (a) and (b). However, the original problem in the question is split into two parts: a) and b). Therefore, each part should be structured separately.\n\nWait, but the example given by the user in the problem had assumptions and then the problem. So perhaps for each part (a) and (b), we need to structure them separately.\n\nBut the user's problem includes both parts. Therefore, when structuring, we need to separate them.\n\nBut the user's main question is whether their proofs (counterexample for a, example for b) are valid. However, the task here is not to answer their question, but to structure their problem into the specified format: Assumptions and Problem.\n\nSo for part (a):\n\nOriginal problem statement: If g∘f is injective, then g is injective. Prove or disprove.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is a function from A to B.\n\n- g is a function from B to C.\n\n- g∘f is injective.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that g is injective.\n\nSimilarly, part (b):\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is a function from A to B.\n\n- g is a function from B to C.\n\n- f is surjective.\n\n- g is surjective.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that g∘f is surjective.\n\nTherefore, each part should be structured with their respective assumptions and problem. However, the user's original question includes both parts, so perhaps they should be formatted as two separate problems.\n\nBut looking back at the example, the original problem was a single problem, and the formatted version included the assumptions and the problem. So perhaps each part (a) and (b) should be formatted separately.\n\nAlternatively, the entire problem includes both parts, so the assumptions for each part are different. Therefore, the formatted problem should present each part with its own assumptions and problem.\n\nHowever, the example provided by the user seems to have combined assumptions and problem into one. But the original example was about a single problem. Here, the user's question has two parts. Therefore, perhaps each part should be formatted separately.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format given. So perhaps for each part (a) and (b), list their respective assumptions and problem.\n\nAlternatively, if the entire problem is considered as two parts, then the assumptions for each part would differ. But the formatting example given was for a single problem. Therefore, I think each part should be treated as a separate problem.\n\nBut since the user's original question includes both parts in one post, perhaps we need to format each part as a separate problem.\n\nSo for part (a):\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $f\\colon A\\to B$ is a function,\n\n- $g\\colon B\\to C$ is a function,\n\n- $g \\circ f$ is injective.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $g$ is injective.\n\nFor part (b):\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $f\\colon A\\to B$ is a surjective function,\n\n- $g\\colon B\\to C$ is a surjective function.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $g \\circ f$ is surjective.\n\nBut the user's original question includes both parts (a) and (b), so perhaps the formatted problem should include both parts with their respective assumptions.\n\nHowever, the example given by the user was a single problem. Therefore, perhaps we need to format each part as a separate problem. Alternatively, since the user's question includes both parts, we can structure them together, but the format requires one assumption list and one problem. Therefore, maybe each part is a separate problem.\n\nAlternatively, considering the user's original problem as two separate problems, each with their own assumptions and problem statements.\n\nIn any case, the key is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nFor part (a):\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $f$ is a function from set $A$ to set $B$,\n\n- $g$ is a function from set $B$ to set $C$,\n\n- The composition $g \\circ f$ is injective.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $g$ is injective.\n\nFor part (b):\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $f$ is a function from set $A$ to set $B$,\n\n- $g$ is a function from set $B$ to set $C$,\n\n- $f$ is surjective,\n\n- $g$ is surjective.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $g \\circ f$ is surjective.\n\nThis way, each part is addressed separately with their respective assumptions and problem statements. However, the original problem statement on Math Stack Exchange includes both parts in one question, so perhaps they should be presented as two separate problems within the same post.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the formatted problem was a single problem. Therefore, perhaps each part (a) and (b) should be formatted as separate problems under the same question.\n\nHowever, the user's instructions specify to structure the problem as per the format given, which includes Assumption and Problem. Therefore, each part (a) and (b) must be formatted individually.\n\nBut since the user's original question combines both parts, I need to parse the question and separate them into two problems.\n\nLet me check the original question again:\n\nTitle: Injective and Surjective Functions\n\nQuestion: Let $f$ and $g$ be functions such that $f\\colon A\\to B$ and $g\\colon B\\to C$. Prove or disprove the following:\n\na) If $g\\circ f$ is injective, then $g$ is injective.\n\nHere's my proof that this is true... [details]... revised my proof for a. I will disprove it using a counterexample... [details].\n\nb) If $f$ and $g$ are surjective, then $g\\circ f$ is surjective. Here's my proof that this is true... [details].\n\nAre these proofs valid?\n\nTherefore, the original problem has two parts, (a) and (b), each with their own conditions. So to format each part separately:\n\nFor part (a):\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $f\\colon A \\to B$ is a function,\n\n- $g\\colon B \\to C$ is a function,\n\n- $g \\circ f$ is injective.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $g$ is injective.\n\nFor part (b):\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $f\\colon A \\to B$ is a surjective function,\n\n- $g\\colon B \\to C$ is a surjective function.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $g \\circ f$ is surjective.\n\nThis seems correct. Each part has its own assumptions and problem. The user's original question combines both, but the formatted version should present each part separately with their respective assumptions and problem statements.",
