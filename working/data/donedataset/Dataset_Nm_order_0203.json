    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully. The title is \"Show that (1 + 1/n)^n is monotonically increasing.\" The user's question restates that they need to show U_n, defined as (1 + 1/n)^n for natural numbers n, is a monotonically increasing sequence. They mention wanting to prove that U_{n+1} - U_n ≥ 0, specifically the expression [(1 + 1/(n+1))^{n+1} - (1 + 1/n)^n] ≥ 0, and they're stuck trying to move forward from that step.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem defines U_n as (1 + 1/n)^n where n is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ). The goal is to show the sequence is monotonically increasing, so the key assumption here is that n is a natural number. The original problem doesn't mention any divisibility conditions or other constraints beyond n being in ℕ.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed as separate lines, each addressing one property of one object. In the example, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the main assumption is that n is a natural number. However, since the sequence is defined for all natural numbers n, maybe there's an implicit assumption that n ≥ 1 or something? Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote \"n ∈ ℕ,\" which typically starts at 1, but sometimes ℕ includes 0. But since (1 + 1/n) would require n ≥ 1, so n is a positive integer. So the assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nSo the assumptions would be: n is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ), and perhaps also that n is a positive integer. Wait, but in the example, they split assumptions into separate lines, even if they're about the same object. Wait, in the example, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Both apply to the same object n, but they are separate conditions. Here, the problem states n is a natural number, which implies it's a positive integer. So maybe just one assumption: n is a natural number. But maybe to be precise, since the problem is about the sequence U_n defined for n ∈ ℕ, and ℕ here is defined as the positive integers (1,2,3,...). So perhaps the assumption is just that n is a natural number. But maybe the original problem in the user's mind might need to consider n starting at 1? Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote \"n ∈ ℕ\" and \"defines a monotonically increasing sequence.\" The key point is that the sequence is defined for all natural numbers n. So the main assumption is that n is a natural number. There are no additional constraints given, so the assumption list should just be one line: n is a natural number.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have Assumption: n is a natural number. Problem: Prove that the sequence U_n = (1 + 1/n)^n is monotonically increasing.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. But in the current problem, there's no such extra condition. The user's task is to structure the problem by filtering out unrelated information and listing the assumptions. Since the original problem only states that n is a natural number, that's the only assumption needed here. There are no other conditions applied. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: n is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequence $$U_n = \\left(1+\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right)^n$$ is monotonically increasing.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"monotonically increasing,\" and the user restates it as \"defines a monotonically increasing sequence.\" So that's the problem statement. The user also mentions they need to show U_{n+1} - U_n ≥ 0, but that's part of their approach, not an assumption. So the problem is to prove that the sequence is monotonically increasing, and the assumption is that n is a natural number.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list the assumption as n being a natural number, and the problem is to prove that U_n is monotonically increasing. The user's own attempt mentions trying to show the difference is non-negative, but that's part of their method, not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nAnother check: the example given had two assumptions because the original problem had two conditions (n is integer and divisible by 7). In this problem, there's only one condition: n is in the natural numbers. So the assumptions section should only include that. Therefore, the formatted problem is as above.",
