    "Content": "I'm having trouble with the following exercise in do Carmo's Riemannian geometry. Let $X$ and $Y$ be differentiable vector fields on a Riemannian manifold $M$. Let $p \\in M$ and let $c: I \\to M$ be an integral curve of $X$ through $p$, i.e. $c(t_0) = p$ and $\\frac{dc}{dt} = X(c(t))$. \nProve that the Riemannian connection of $M$ is $(\\nabla_XY \\ )(p) = \\frac{d}{dt} (P^{-1}_{c,t_0,t}(Y(c(t)))\\ |_{t=t_0}$ where $P^{-1}_{c,t_0,t}: T_{c(t_0)}M \\to T_{c(t)}M$ is the parallel transport along $c$, from $t_0$ to $t$. I guess, I don't have enough understanding of how to handle the parallel transport (since it is only given as the unique solution to a differential equation). Any hints would be greatly appreciated! Thank you,\nS. L. Edit: Do Carmo first introduced the notion of an affine connection $\\nabla: \\text{Vect}(M) \\times \\text{Vect}(M) \\to \\text{Vect}(M)$,   $(X,Y) \\mapsto \\nabla_XY$. With the following properties: $\\nabla_{fX + gY}Z = f\\nabla_XZ + g \\nabla_YZ$ $\\nabla_X(Y+Z) = \\nabla_XY + \\nabla_XZ$ $\\nabla_X(fY) = f\\nabla_XY + X(f)Y$ for $X,Y,Z \\in \\text{Vect}(M)$ and $f,g \\in C^\\infty(M)$. And then showed that there is a unique correspondence which associates to a vector field $V$ along the differentiable curve $c: I \\to M$ another vector field $\\frac{DV}{dt}$ along c, called covariant derivative of $V$ along $c$, with three more properties: $\\frac{D}{dt}(V+W) =  \\frac{D}{dt}V +  \\frac{D}{dt}W$ $ \\frac{D}{dt}(fV) =  \\frac{df}{dt}V +  f\\frac{D}{dt}V$ If $V$ is induced by a vector field $Y \\in \\text{Vect}(M), then  \\frac{D}{dt}V = \\nabla_{dc/dt}Y$ Then he showed existence and uniqueness of the parallel transport along a curve, and went on to prove existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connection. I hope this makes things clearer? Thanks for the quick answer!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\{e_i\\}\\subseteq T_{c(t_0)}M$ be a basis.  Define $E_i(t)$ as the parallel translation of $e_i$ along $c(t)$.  Prove to yourself that $\\{E_i(t)\\}$ forms a basis of $T_{c(t)}$ for all $t$ (hint, use the uniqueness part of solving linear ODEs). Now, we can write $Y(c(t)) = \\sum_i a_i(t) E_i(t)$.  Then, since the $E_i(t)$ are parallel, and since $P_{c,t_0,t}$ is linear, we have $P^{-1}_{c,t_0, t}(Y(c(t)) = \\sum_i a_i(t) e_i$. From here, by actually computing the limit, it's not too hard to see that $\\frac{d}{dt} P^{-1}_{c,t_o,t}Y(c(t))|_{t=t_0} = \\sum_i a_i'(t_0)e_i$. Thus, the goal is to show that $\\nabla_X Y(p)$ can also be written like this. But $\\nabla_X Y(p) = \\nabla_X \\sum_i a_i(t)E_i(t)|_{t=t_0} = \\sum_i a_i(t_0) \\nabla_X E_i(t)|_{t=t_0} + \\sum_i a_i'(t_0) E_i(t_0)$.  (The second equality is just the Leibniz rule every connection must satisfy).  However, $\\nabla_X E_i(t)$ is $\\frac{D}{dt} E_i(t)$ and this is 0 since the $E_i$ are parallel.  Hence, the first term of the sum vanishes, so we get the desired result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is working on an exercise from do Carmo's Riemannian geometry book. The goal is to prove that the Levi-Civita connection, specifically the covariant derivative ∇_X Y at a point p, can be expressed as the derivative of the parallel transport inverse applied to Y along the integral curve of X through p. \n\nFirst, let's outline the given information and assumptions. The problem states that X and Y are differentiable vector fields on a Riemannian manifold M. There's a point p in M, and an integral curve c of X passing through p. That means c(t_0) = p and the derivative of c with respect to t is X(c(t)). The main claim is that the Levi-Civita connection ∇_X Y at p equals the derivative with respect to t at t_0 of the inverse parallel transport of Y(c(t)) along c from t_0 to t. \n\nThe user is confused about handling parallel transport, which is defined via a differential equation. They also added details about how do Carmo introduced affine connections and the covariant derivative along a curve, leading to the existence and uniqueness of parallel transport and the Levi-Civita connection.\n\nTo structure this problem properly, I need to list each assumption clearly. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's start:\n\n1. M is a Riemannian manifold. (This is given because the problem is in Riemannian geometry.)\n2. X and Y are differentiable vector fields on M. (Explicitly stated in the problem.)\n3. p is a point in M. (Given as \"Let p ∈ M\".)\n4. c: I → M is an integral curve of X through p, meaning c(t_0) = p and dc/dt = X(c(t)). (The problem defines c as the integral curve with these conditions.)\n5. The Levi-Civita connection is used. (Since the problem refers to the Riemannian connection, which is the Levi-Civita connection.)\n6. P^{-1}_{c,t_0,t} is the inverse parallel transport along c from t_0 to t. (The problem defines P^{-1} as such.)\n7. The covariant derivative ∇_X Y at p is given by the derivative of P^{-1}(Y(c(t))) evaluated at t = t_0. (This is the expression they need to prove.)\n\nWait, but point 7 is actually the conclusion they need to prove, not an assumption. So the problem is to show that under the assumptions of M being Riemannian, X and Y being vector fields, c being the integral curve of X through p, and using the Levi-Civita connection, then ∇_X Y(p) equals that derivative involving parallel transport.\n\nSo the assumptions should be the given conditions, not including what needs to be proven. Let me correct that:\n\nAssumptions:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- X and Y are differentiable vector fields on M.\n- p is a point in M.\n- c: I → M is an integral curve of X through p, i.e., c(t_0) = p and dc/dt = X(c(t)).\n- P_{c,t_0,t} is the parallel transport along c from t_0 to t.\n- The Levi-Civita connection is the Riemannian connection on M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (∇_X Y)(p) = d/dt|_{t=t_0} [P^{-1}_{c,t_0,t}(Y(c(t)))].\n\nNow, checking the example provided earlier, the assumptions are listed line by line, each about one object or condition. Here, each bullet point addresses a single condition. For example, \"M is a Riemannian manifold\" is one condition. \"X and Y are differentiable vector fields\" is another. The integral curve conditions are two, but in the problem statement, they are part of the same sentence. However, in the example, sometimes multiple conditions related to the same object are separate. For instance, in the original example, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. Here, the integral curve c has two properties: passing through p at t_0 and having derivative X(c(t)). So maybe split those into two assumptions:\n\n- c: I → M is an integral curve of X.\n- c(t_0) = p.\n- dc/dt = X(c(t)) for all t in I.\n\nBut in the problem statement, they wrote \"Let c: I → M be an integral curve of X through p, i.e., c(t_0) = p and dc/dt = X(c(t))\". So perhaps each of these is a separate condition. So to split them:\n\nAssumptions:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- X is a differentiable vector field on M.\n- Y is a differentiable vector field on M.\n- p is a point in M.\n- c: I → M is a curve such that c(t_0) = p.\n- c is an integral curve of X, i.e., dc/dt = X(c(t)).\n- P_{c,t_0,t} is the parallel transport along c from t_0 to t.\n- The connection ∇ is the Levi-Civita connection on M.\n\nBut perhaps \"c is an integral curve of X\" and \"c passes through p at t_0\" can be separate assumptions. However, the problem states \"integral curve of X through p\", which combines both. But according to the example, each assumption should address one property. So splitting into two: c is an integral curve of X, and c passes through p at t_0.\n\nBut wait, the definition of integral curve through p is that it satisfies c(t_0) = p and dc/dt = X(c(t)). So maybe these two are both necessary conditions for c to be an integral curve through p.\n\nBut according to the problem's original statement: \"c: I → M be an integral curve of X through p, i.e., c(t_0) = p and dc/dt = X(c(t))\". So the problem combines both conditions under the definition of integral curve through p. However, in the example, each condition is listed separately. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So here, \"c(t_0) = p\" and \"dc/dt = X(c(t))\" should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold,\n- X is a differentiable vector field on M,\n- Y is a differentiable vector field on M,\n- p is a point in M,\n- c is a curve defined on interval I,\n- c(t_0) = p,\n- The derivative of c with respect to t is X(c(t)),\n- P_{c,t_0,t} is the parallel transport along c from t_0 to t,\n- The connection ∇ is the Levi-Civita connection on M.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. For example, \"c is an integral curve of X through p\" is given, which includes both c(t_0) = p and dc/dt = X(c(t)). So perhaps in the problem statement, \"c is an integral curve of X through p\" is one condition, but according to the example's approach, we need to split it into two separate assumptions. So to follow the example strictly, each single property on one line.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions list would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is a Riemannian manifold,\n- X is a differentiable vector field on M,\n- Y is a differentiable vector field on M,\n- p is a point in M,\n- c: I → M is a differentiable curve,\n- c(t_0) = p,\n- The derivative of c at t is X(c(t)) for all t ∈ I,\n- P_{c,t_0,t} denotes the parallel transport along c from t_0 to t,\n- ∇ is the Levi-Civita connection on M.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (∇_X Y)(p) = d/dt|_{t=t_0} [P^{-1}_{c,t_0,t}(Y(c(t)))].\n\nThis seems to capture all the necessary conditions. The key points are that c is the integral curve of X through p, which involves both the initial condition c(t_0)=p and the derivative being X along c. The parallel transport is along the curve c, and the connection is Levi-Civita. The problem is to show the expression for the covariant derivative at p.\n\nI should also check if any other assumptions are implied but not stated. For example, the existence of parallel transport is guaranteed by the Riemannian structure and the Levi-Civita connection, which is covered by M being Riemannian and ∇ being Levi-Civita. So that's covered.\n\nAnother thing: The inverse parallel transport P^{-1} goes from T_{c(t)}M to T_{c(t_0)}M, right? Because parallel transport P_{c,t_0,t} goes from T_{c(t_0)}M to T_{c(t)}M, so the inverse would go the other way. So when they write P^{-1}_{c,t_0,t}(Y(c(t))), Y(c(t)) is in T_{c(t)}M, so applying the inverse parallel transport brings it back to T_{c(t_0)}M, which is T_p M. Then taking the derivative in t at t_0 gives an element of T_p M, which matches the left-hand side ∇_X Y(p). So that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list all these assumptions, each on a separate line, and then state the problem as proving that the covariant derivative equals that derivative of the parallel-transported vector field.",
