    "Content": "We have the sum of squares of $n$ consecutive positive integers: $$S=(a+1)^2+(a+2)^2+ ... +(a+n)^2$$ Problem was to find the smallest $n$ such, that $S=b^2$ will be square of some positive integer. I found an example for $n=11$. Now, I'm trying to prove, that if $2<n<11$ there is't any solution. So I need some help with this: If $n,a,b \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $n<11$ prove that equation $$\nn\\cdot a^2 + n(n+1)\\cdot a + \\frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)=b^2\n$$ can't be solved. Or if I'm wrong, find counterexample. The only idea I have is: to consider the remains $\\operatorname{Mod}[b^2,n]$ and $\\operatorname{Mod}[\\frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1),n]$. For each $2<n<11$, but it is very long.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In general, there are $n$ consecutive squares that add to a square if and only if the following Diophantine equation has solutions: $$x^2-ny^2=\\frac{n(n-1)(n+1)}{3}$$ with the added parity condition that $y$ and $n$ are different parities. The value $y$ is just the sum of the first and last element of the sequence, so $$\\frac{y-n+1}{2}$$ is the beginning of the sequence. When $n$ is not  square, then the nice thing about Pell-like equations is that if there is one solution with the above parity condition, there are infinitely many. In particular, then there is always a sequence of consecutive positive numbers if there is any consecutive sequence of integers. If $n$ is a perfect square, then there is a solution if and only if $(n,6)=1$. It is not always the case that you can find consecutive squares of positive numbers in this case. But we can get a solution $m,m+1,\\dots,m+n-1$ with $m=\\frac{(n+1)(n-25)}{48}$ when $n$ a perfect square, which gives positive solutions except when $n=1$ and $n=25$.  But $n=1$ obviously has positive solutions, so the only problem case is $n=25$. There is no positive solution when $n=25$, only a non-negative solution: $0^2+1^2\\dots+24^2$ is a square. When $n$ is not a perfect square, this condition gets harder, but the Pell-like nature of the equation gives us a way to find some solutions. For exmaple, $u^2-nv^2=n(n-1)$ has a trivial solution, so if $n+1$ is divisible by $3$ then we can find a solution to the above equation of $w^2-nz^2 = \\frac{n+1}{3}$ yields a solution to the above, and it turns out you can easily show in that case that the solution satisfies the parity condition. In particular, if $n=3w^2-1$, then $(w,z)=(w,0)$ is a solution, so we know we have infinitely many non-square values of $n$, and, in particular, $n=11$ when $w=2$. Necessary conditions when $n$  is not a square: A. Factor $n=a^{2}b$, with $b$ square-free, then: If $2 \\mid a$, then $2 \\mid b$ If $3 \\mid a$, then $3 \\mid b$ $3$ is a square $\\pmod{b}$. (Alternatively, the only primes that divide\n $b$ are $2$,  $3$, and primes of the form $12k \\pm 1$.) If $3 \\mid b$, then $b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$ B. If $3 \\mid n+1$, then $\\frac{n+1}{3}$ is the sum of two perfect squares If $3 \\nmid n+1$, then $n+1$ is the sum of two perfect squares These can be used to exclude $n=3,...,10$: $3$ violates $A.4.$ $4$ is a square and $(4,6)\\neq 1$ $5$ violates $A.3.$. $6$ violates $B.2$. $7$ violates $A.3.$ $8$ violates $B.1.$ $9$ is a square not relatively prime to $6$. $10$ violates $B.2.$ See here for some more details and some ways to explicitly construct such $n$. I don't have sufficient conditions.  The smalles number that satisfies the above conditions but for which there is no solution is $n=842$. It is easier to come up with necessary and sufficient conditions for the question of whether there exists an arithmetic progression of length $n$ such that the sum of the squares is a square. Indeed, if $y$ and $n$ are the same parity in the above equation, that amounts to a sequence of $n$ consecutive odd numbers whose squares add up to a square.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully to identify all the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that for certain values of n (specifically when 2 < n < 11), the equation involving the sum of consecutive squares doesn't have a solution. The equation given is:\n\n$$\nn\\cdot a^2 + n(n+1)\\cdot a + \\frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)=b^2\n$$\n\nThe user mentions that they found a solution for n=11 but want to prove no solutions exist for 2 < n < 11. They also mentioned considering modular arithmetic approaches but found it lengthy.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that n, a, b are natural numbers (so they are positive integers). Also, n is between 2 and 11 (exclusive), so n ranges from 3 to 10 inclusive. The goal is to prove that under these conditions, the equation can't be solved unless I'm wrong, in which case a counterexample should be found.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. a is a natural number.\n3. b is a natural number.\n4. n is greater than 2.\n5. n is less than 11.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applying to individual objects (n, a, b). The original problem statement might have combined some of these, but according to the format, each assumption should be a single property for one object. So splitting into each condition line by line.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the given equation can't be solved under these assumptions or find a counterexample.\n\nI need to check if the original problem mentions anything else. The user mentions \"n,a,b ∈ N\" and \"n<11\" and \"2<n<11\". So the key assumptions are n, a, b are natural numbers, n is between 3 and 10 inclusive. The problem is to show the equation can't hold under these constraints.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions as per the example, each on a separate line:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\na is a natural number,\nb is a natural number,\nn is greater than 2,\nn is less than 11.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the equation $$n\\cdot a^2 + n(n+1)\\cdot a + \\frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)=b^2$$ cannot be solved, or find a counterexample.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included both n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. Here, the original problem states n,a,b are natural numbers, so they are positive integers. Also, n is between 3 and 10 inclusive. So each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nYes, that's correct. Each assumption line addresses one property of one object.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list each of these conditions as separate assumptions, then state the problem as proving the equation has no solution under these conditions, or find a counterexample.\n\nI think that's it. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, we have n, a, b as natural numbers (so three assumptions), then n >2 and n <11 (two more). So total five assumptions, each on its own line.",
