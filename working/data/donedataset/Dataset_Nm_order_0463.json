    "Content": "This is ex. 14.2.7. from Terence Tao's Analysis II book. Let $I:=[a,b]$ be an interval and $f_n:I \\rightarrow \\mathbb R$ differentiable functions with $f_n'$ converges uniform to a function $g:I \\rightarrow \\mathbb R$. Suppose $\\exists x_0 \\in I: \\lim \\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} f_n(x_0) = L \\in \\mathbb R$. Then the $f_n$ converge uniformly to a differentiable function $f:I \\rightarrow \\mathbb R$ with $f' = g$. We are not given that the $f_n'$ are continuous but he gives the hint that\n$$\nd_{\\infty}(f_n',f_m') \\leq \\epsilon \\Rightarrow |(f_n(x)-f_m(x))-(f_n(x_0)-f_m(x_0))| \\leq \\epsilon |x-x_0|\n$$ This can be shown by the mean value theorem. My question is : How does this help me to prove the theorem ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $\\{f_n(x_0)\\}$ converges, for each $\\epsilon > 0$ and $n, m$ large enough we have $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\lvert f_n(x) - f_m(x) \\rvert &\\leq \\left\\lvert (f_n(x)-f_m(x))-(f_n(x_0)-f_m(x_0)) \\right\\rvert + \\left\\lvert f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0) \\right\\rvert \\\\ \n&\\leq \\epsilon \\left\\lvert x - x_0 \\right\\rvert + \\epsilon \\\\\n&\\leq \\epsilon (b - a) + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n$$ Hence $f_n$ converges uniformly on $I$ to a function $f$ , moreover for each $\\epsilon > 0$ and $m, n$ large enough, the inequality $$\n\\left\\lvert \\frac {f_n(y) - f_n(x)} {y - x} - \\frac {f_m(y) - f_m(x)} {y - x} \\right\\rvert \\leq \\epsilon\n$$ holds for each $x\\neq y\\in I$ . (It is the same inequality of the hint but now we can assume it holds for generic $y\\in I$ , because we showed $f_n(y)$ converges for all $y \\in I$ ) The above relation implies that $\\frac {f_n(y) - f_n(x)} {y - x}$ converges uniformly to $\\frac {f(y) - f(x)} {y - x}$ . Now we can write $$\n\\left\\lvert\\frac {f(y) - f(x)} {y - x} - g(x) \\right\\rvert \\leq \\\\\n\\left\\lvert\\frac {f(y) - f(x)} {y - x} - \\frac {f_n(y) - f_n(x)} {y - x} \\right\\rvert + \\left\\lvert \\frac {f_n(y) - f_n(x)} {y - x}  - f_n'(x)\\right\\rvert + \\left\\lvert f_n'(x) - g(x) \\right\\rvert\n$$ For each $\\epsilon > 0$ and $n$ large enough we get $$\n\\left\\lvert\\frac {f(y) - f(x)} {y - x} - g(x) \\right\\rvert \\leq 2\\frac \\epsilon 3 + \\left\\lvert \\frac {f_n(y) - f_n(x)} {y - x}  - f_n'(x)\\right\\rvert\n$$ and for $y$ close enough to $x$ $$\n\\left\\lvert\\frac {f(y) - f(x)} {y - x} - g(x) \\right\\rvert \\leq \\epsilon \n$$ So $f'(x)$ exists and is equal to $g(x)$ . Edit To clarify the point raised by @DavidC.Ullrich. Since ${f'_n}$ converges uniformly, there exists $N \\in \\mathbb N$ such that $\\lVert f'_n - f'_m \\rVert_\\infty < \\epsilon$ for all $n, m > N$ , that is $$\n|f'_n(x) - f'_m(x)| < \\epsilon \\qquad \\forall m,n > N, \\forall x\\in I\n$$ So, by means of the mean value theorem , for each $m,n > N$ and for each $x \\neq y\\in I$ we can write $$\n\\left\\lvert \\frac {f_n(y) - f_n(x)} {y - x} - \\frac {f_m(y) - f_m(x)} {y - x} \\right\\rvert = \\\\\n\\left\\lvert \\frac {f_n(y) - f_m(y)} {y - x} - \\frac {f_n(x) - f_m(x)} {y - x} \\right\\rvert = \\\\\n\\left\\lvert \\frac {(f_n - f_m)(y)- (f_n - f_m)(x)} {y - x}\\right\\rvert = \\\\\n\\lvert (f_n - f_m)'(\\xi) \\rvert = \\\\\n\\lvert f_n'(\\xi) - f_m'(\\xi)\\rvert < \\epsilon\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the problem is about proving that if we have a sequence of differentiable functions \\( f_n \\) on an interval \\( I = [a, b] \\), and their derivatives \\( f_n' \\) converge uniformly to a function \\( g \\), and there's a point \\( x_0 \\) where \\( f_n(x_0) \\) converges to some limit \\( L \\), then the functions \\( f_n \\) themselves converge uniformly to a differentiable function \\( f \\) with \\( f' = g \\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall the given hint. The hint mentions that if the uniform distance between \\( f_n' \\) and \\( f_m' \\) is small (say, less than \\( \\epsilon \\)), then the difference \\( |(f_n(x) - f_m(x)) - (f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0))| \\) is bounded by \\( \\epsilon |x - x_0| \\). This comes from the Mean Value Theorem. So, how does this help in proving uniform convergence of \\( f_n \\)?\n\nWell, uniform convergence of the derivatives \\( f_n' \\) to \\( g \\) suggests that the derivatives are getting close to each other uniformly. The hint seems to relate the difference in the functions \\( f_n - f_m \\) to the difference in their derivatives. Using the Mean Value Theorem on the function \\( f_n - f_m \\), we can say that there exists some \\( c \\) between \\( x \\) and \\( x_0 \\) such that \\( (f_n(x) - f_m(x)) - (f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0)) = (f_n' - f_m')(c)(x - x_0) \\). Taking absolute values and using the uniform convergence of derivatives, we can bound this by \\( \\epsilon |x - x_0| \\), which is then at most \\( \\epsilon (b - a) \\) since \\( x \\) is in the interval \\( [a, b] \\).\n\nBut wait, how does this help with the convergence of \\( f_n \\)? Maybe we can show that \\( f_n \\) is uniformly Cauchy. If we can show that for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists \\( N \\) such that for all \\( m, n \\geq N \\), \\( |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \\epsilon \\) for all \\( x \\), then by the completeness of real numbers, \\( f_n \\) would converge uniformly.\n\nLet's see. Using the inequality from the hint: \\( |(f_n(x) - f_m(x)) - (f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0))| \\leq \\epsilon |x - x_0| \\). If we rearrange this, we get \\( |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \\leq |f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0)| + \\epsilon |x - x_0| \\).\n\nBut we also know that \\( f_n(x_0) \\) converges to \\( L \\), so \\( f_n(x_0) \\) is a Cauchy sequence. Therefore, for sufficiently large \\( m, n \\), \\( |f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0)| < \\epsilon \\). Combining this with the previous inequality, we get \\( |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \\leq \\epsilon + \\epsilon (b - a) \\). If we choose \\( \\epsilon \\) appropriately, this can be made arbitrarily small, which shows that \\( f_n \\) is uniformly Cauchy, hence converges uniformly to some function \\( f \\).\n\nNow, once we have uniform convergence of \\( f_n \\) to \\( f \\), we need to show that \\( f \\) is differentiable with derivative \\( g \\). Normally, we know that if the derivatives \\( f_n' \\) converge uniformly and \\( f_n \\) converges at least pointwise, then the limit function is differentiable and its derivative is the limit of the derivatives. But here, since the derivatives are converging uniformly to \\( g \\), and \\( f_n \\) converges uniformly to \\( f \\), we can apply the theorem that under these conditions, \\( f' = g \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the derivatives are not necessarily continuous. However, in the standard theorem (like in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis), the theorem requires that the derivatives are continuous, but here Tao's problem doesn't assume that. So how does that affect the proof?\n\nPerhaps because even without the continuity of the derivatives, the uniform convergence of the derivatives and the pointwise convergence at \\( x_0 \\) are sufficient. The key is using the Mean Value Theorem to relate the derivatives to the functions. Since the derivatives converge uniformly, the functions are not just converging uniformly, but their difference quotients will converge to the derivative.\n\nAlternatively, once we have uniform convergence of \\( f_n \\) to \\( f \\), and \\( f_n' \\) converges uniformly to \\( g \\), then even without continuity of \\( f_n' \\), we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. If we can express \\( f_n(x) = f_n(x_0) + \\int_{x_0}^x f_n'(t) dt \\), then taking the limit as \\( n \\to \\infty \\), we get \\( f(x) = L + \\int_{x_0}^x g(t) dt \\), which would imply that \\( f' = g \\).\n\nBut the problem is that the functions \\( f_n \\) are differentiable, but we don't know if their derivatives are integrable. However, since \\( f_n' \\) converges uniformly to \\( g \\), and each \\( f_n' \\) is Riemann integrable (as a derivative, not necessarily continuous), but actually, derivatives can be discontinuous, but according to the FTC, if \\( f_n' \\) is Riemann integrable, then the integral formula holds. However, in Tao's Analysis II, he might be working in a context where derivatives are assumed to be Riemann integrable, or perhaps using Henstock-Kurzweil integral, but I think in standard analysis, even if the derivative is not continuous, the integral of the derivative from \\( x_0 \\) to \\( x \\) is still \\( f_n(x) - f_n(x_0) \\).\n\nWait, actually, the FTC part 1 says that if \\( f_n' \\) is Riemann integrable, then \\( \\int_{x_0}^x f_n' = f_n(x) - f_n(x_0) \\). But if \\( f_n' \\) is not continuous, we might not know if it's integrable. However, in Tao's book, he might be assuming that derivatives are Riemann integrable, or perhaps working in a context where this is given. Alternatively, since \\( f_n \\) is differentiable on [a,b], and the derivative is bounded (since \\( f_n' \\) converges uniformly, hence uniformly Cauchy, hence uniformly bounded), then perhaps \\( f_n' \\) is Riemann integrable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we don't need to use the integral. Since we have uniform convergence of \\( f_n' \\) to \\( g \\), and we have uniform convergence of \\( f_n \\) to \\( f \\), then perhaps by the theorem of differentiation of sequences, which usually requires uniform convergence of derivatives and pointwise convergence of functions at least one point, then the limit function is differentiable and its derivative is the limit of the derivatives.\n\nBut the standard theorem (like in Rudin) does require that the derivatives are continuous. However, according to the problem statement here, Tao's exercise doesn't assume the continuity of the derivatives. So how does the proof go?\n\nMaybe through the Mean Value Theorem approach. Let me think. Let \\( f_n \\) converges uniformly to \\( f \\), and \\( f_n' \\) converges uniformly to \\( g \\). We need to show that \\( f' = g \\). Take any point \\( x \\in I \\). We need to show that the derivative of \\( f \\) at \\( x \\) is \\( g(x) \\).\n\nConsider the difference quotient \\( \\frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x} \\). We can write this as the limit as \\( n \\to \\infty \\) of \\( \\frac{f_n(t) - f_n(x)}{t - x} \\). By the Mean Value Theorem, for each \\( n \\), there exists \\( c_n \\) between \\( t \\) and \\( x \\) such that \\( \\frac{f_n(t) - f_n(x)}{t - x} = f_n'(c_n) \\). Now, as \\( n \\to \\infty \\), \\( f_n'(c_n) \\) converges to \\( g(c_n) \\). But \\( c_n \\) is between \\( t \\) and \\( x \\), so as \\( t \\to x \\), \\( c_n \\to x \\) (assuming \\( t \\) approaches \\( x \\)). However, we have uniform convergence of \\( f_n' \\) to \\( g \\), so \\( |f_n'(c_n) - g(c_n)| \\leq \\sup_{y \\in I} |f_n'(y) - g(y)| \\), which goes to zero as \\( n \\to \\infty \\). Therefore, the limit as \\( n \\to \\infty \\) of \\( f_n'(c_n) \\) is \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(c_n) \\). But since \\( g \\) is continuous (as a uniform limit of functions, which are derivatives, but not necessarily continuous themselves; however, uniform limit of functions is continuous, so \\( g \\) must be continuous). Wait, even if each \\( f_n' \\) is not continuous, their uniform limit \\( g \\) is continuous. So \\( g \\) is continuous.\n\nTherefore, as \\( t \\to x \\), \\( c_n \\) approaches \\( x \\), but \\( n \\) is going to infinity. Wait, this seems a bit tangled. Alternatively, once we have that \\( f_n \\to f \\) uniformly and \\( f_n' \\to g \\) uniformly, then \\( f \\) is differentiable and \\( f' = g \\). The key is that even without assuming \\( f_n' \\) are continuous, the uniform convergence of the derivatives and the pointwise convergence of the functions at one point is enough to bootstrap the uniform convergence of the functions, and then use the Mean Value Theorem to connect the derivatives.\n\nBut let's get back to the original problem. The user is asking how the given hint helps in proving the theorem. The hint provides an inequality that relates the difference of the functions to the difference of their derivatives. So, using this inequality, we can establish that \\( f_n \\) is uniformly Cauchy, given that \\( f_n' \\) is uniformly Cauchy (which follows from the uniform convergence of \\( f_n' \\)) and that \\( f_n(x_0) \\) is Cauchy (which is given). \n\nOnce we have uniform convergence of \\( f_n \\) to \\( f \\), then we need to show that \\( f \\) is differentiable with derivative \\( g \\). For this, take a point \\( x \\in I \\), and consider \\( \\frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x} \\). Since \\( f_n \\to f \\) uniformly, we can interchange the limit and the difference quotient? Not exactly, but we can write:\n\n\\( \\frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f_n(t) - f_n(x)}{t - x} \\).\n\nFor each \\( n \\), by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists \\( c_n \\) between \\( t \\) and \\( x \\) such that \\( \\frac{f_n(t) - f_n(x)}{t - x} = f_n'(c_n) \\).\n\nNow, as \\( n \\to \\infty \\), \\( f_n'(c_n) \\) converges to \\( g(c_n) \\) because \\( f_n' \\) converges uniformly to \\( g \\). So, \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n'(c_n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(c_n) \\). But as \\( t \\to x \\), \\( c_n \\) approaches \\( x \\) for each fixed \\( n \\), but since \\( n \\) is going to infinity, this is tricky. Instead, perhaps we need to take the limit as \\( t \\to x \\) first, then \\( n \\to \\infty \\), but we need to interchange the limits.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( f_n' \\) converges uniformly to \\( g \\), which is continuous, then for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists \\( N \\) such that for all \\( n \\geq N \\), \\( |f_n'(y) - g(y)| < \\epsilon \\) for all \\( y \\). Then, for \\( n \\geq N \\):\n\n\\( |\\frac{f_n(t) - f_n(x)}{t - x} - g(x)| \\leq |f_n'(c_n) - g(c_n)| + |g(c_n) - g(x)| \\leq \\epsilon + |g(c_n) - g(x)| \\).\n\nSince \\( g \\) is continuous, as \\( t \\to x \\), \\( c_n \\to x \\), so \\( |g(c_n) - g(x)| < \\epsilon \\) for \\( t \\) close enough to \\( x \\). Therefore, the difference quotient \\( \\frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x} \\) can be made arbitrarily close to \\( g(x) \\) by choosing \\( t \\) close to \\( x \\), hence \\( f'(x) = g(x) \\).\n\nPutting it all together, the key steps are:\n\n1. Use the given hint and the convergence of \\( f_n(x_0) \\) to show that \\( f_n \\) is uniformly Cauchy, hence converges uniformly to some \\( f \\).\n\n2. Use the uniform convergence of \\( f_n \\) and \\( f_n' \\), along with the Mean Value Theorem, to show that \\( f \\) is differentiable with derivative \\( g \\).\n\nThe hint is essential for step 1, establishing the uniform convergence of \\( f_n \\). Without the hint, it might not be obvious how to connect the uniform convergence of derivatives to the convergence of the functions themselves, especially when only given convergence at a single point \\( x_0 \\).",
