    "Content": "It is well-known that if $S$ is a graded ring, and $f$ is a homogeneous element of positive degree, then there is a bijection between the homogeneous prime ideals of the localization $S_f$ and the prime ideals of $S_{(f)}$, the subring of $S_f$ comprising the homogeneous elements of degree $0$. This is proposition II.2.5b in Hartshorne, exercise 5.5B in Ravi Vakil's notes $[1]$ (p. $130$ of the February $24$, $2012$ version), and proposition 8.1.21 of Akhil Mathew's notes $[2]$ (p. $136$). Unfortunately I cannot follow any of those proofs to my own satisfaction, perhaps because I'm not well-versed in commutative algebra. The crux of the proof appears to be to show that, given a homogeneous prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $S$ not containing $f$, the construction used to obtain a prime ideal $\\Psi (\\mathfrak{q})$ of $S$ from a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ of $S_{(f)}$ will recover $\\mathfrak{p}$ when $\\mathfrak{q} = S_f  \\mathfrak{p} \\cap S_{(f)}$. To be precise, let $\\Psi (\\mathfrak{q})$ be the homogeneous ideal of $S$ generated by\n$$\\bigcup_{d \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\{ s \\in S_d : s / f^d \\in \\mathfrak{q} \\}$$\nand let $\\Phi (\\mathfrak{p}) = S_f \\mathfrak{p} \\cap S_{(f)}$. It's easy to see that $\\Phi \\circ \\Psi$ acts as the identity on $\\operatorname{Spec} A$ (or, for that matter, the set of all ideals of $A$), but I cannot see any obvious reason why $\\Psi \\circ \\Phi$ should act as the identity on the set of prime ideals of $S$ not containing $f$. A detailed proof of this point would be much appreciated.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "I guess I should post an answer and resolve this question... Let $D = \\{ \\mathfrak{p} \\in \\operatorname{Proj} S : f \\notin \\mathfrak{p} \\}$. Suppose $\\mathfrak{p} \\in D$. If $s \\in \\mathfrak{p} \\cap S_d$, i.e. if $s$ is an element of $\\mathfrak{p}$ of degree $d$, then $s / f^d \\in \\Phi (\\mathfrak{p})$, so certainly $s \\in \\Psi (\\Phi (\\mathfrak{p}))$, and thus $\\mathfrak{p} \\subseteq \\Psi (\\Phi(\\mathfrak{p}))$. Conversely, if $s \\in \\Psi (\\Phi (\\mathfrak{p})) \\cap S_d$, then $s / f^d \\in \\Phi (\\mathfrak{p})$, so there is some $s' \\in \\mathfrak{p}$ such that $s' / f^{d'} = s / f^d$. This implies, for some $e$, $f^e ( f^d s' - f^{d'} s ) = 0$. Observe that $s' \\in \\mathfrak{p}$ but $f^{d' + e} \\notin \\mathfrak{p}$, so $s \\in \\mathfrak{p}$ since $\\mathfrak{p}$ is a homogeneous prime ideal. Hence, $\\mathfrak{p} \\supseteq \\Psi(\\Phi(\\mathfrak{p}))$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help the user by formatting their math problem according to the specified structure. Let's start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user's question is about understanding a bijection between homogeneous prime ideals of the localization S_f and prime ideals of the subring (S_f)_0. They mention references to Hartshorne, Vakil, and Mathew's notes but are struggling with the proof details. Specifically, they're stuck on showing that the composition of the maps Ψ and Φ acts as the identity on the set of prime ideals of S not containing f.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem from this. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem is the main statement to be proven.\n\nLooking at the problem: The key elements are that S is a graded ring, f is a homogeneous element of positive degree, and the bijection between homogeneous prime ideals of S_f and prime ideals of (S_f)_0 (which is S_{(f)}). The user is focusing on proving that Ψ ∘ Φ is the identity on primes not containing f.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n- S is a graded ring.\n- f is a homogeneous element of S with positive degree.\n- The prime ideals considered in S_f are homogeneous.\n- The prime ideals in S_{(f)} are considered.\n- The prime ideal 𝔭 does not contain f.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove the bijection via showing Ψ ∘ Φ acts as the identity on those primes.\n\nWait, the original problem in the references is about the bijection between homogeneous primes of S_f and primes of S_{(f)}. The user is specifically asking about the step where given a homogeneous prime 𝔭 in S not containing f, when you take Φ(𝔭) = S_f 𝔭 ∩ S_{(f)} and then apply Ψ to it, you should get back 𝔭. They need a detailed proof of this.\n\nSo the problem as posed is to show that Ψ(Φ(𝔭)) = 𝔭 when 𝔭 is a homogeneous prime ideal of S not containing f.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. S is a graded ring.\n2. f is a homogeneous element of S with positive degree.\n3. 𝔭 is a homogeneous prime ideal of S.\n4. 𝔭 does not contain f.\n5. Φ(𝔮) = S_f 𝔮 ∩ S_{(f)} for a prime ideal 𝔮 of S_{(f)}.\n6. Ψ(𝔭) is the homogeneous ideal generated by ∪_{d∈ℕ} {s ∈ S_d : s/f^d ∈ 𝔭}.\n\nBut maybe need to break down each assumption into single conditions. Let's see:\n\nAssumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nS is a graded ring,\nf is a homogeneous element of S,\nf has positive degree,\n𝔭 is a homogeneous prime ideal of S,\n𝔭 does not contain f,\nΦ(𝔮) is defined as S_f 𝔮 ∩ S_{(f)},\nΨ(𝔭) is the homogeneous ideal generated by ∪_{d∈ℕ} {s ∈ S_d : s/f^d ∈ 𝔮}.\n\nWait, maybe adjust that. The problem is about the maps Φ and Ψ. The user defines Φ(𝔭) = S_f 𝔭 ∩ S_{(f)} where 𝔭 is a homogeneous prime ideal of S not containing f. Then Ψ takes a prime 𝔮 of S_{(f)} and constructs a homogeneous ideal of S by taking elements s in S_d such that s/f^d is in 𝔮, for each d.\n\nThe key is that for 𝔭 in Spec S homogeneous, not containing f, then Ψ(Φ(𝔭)) should equal 𝔭.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. S is a graded ring.\n2. f is a homogeneous element of S of positive degree.\n3. 𝔭 is a homogeneous prime ideal of S.\n4. 𝔭 does not contain f.\n5. Φ is the map sending 𝔭 to S_f 𝔭 ∩ S_{(f)}.\n6. Ψ is the map sending a prime ideal 𝔮 of S_{(f)} to the homogeneous ideal generated by {s ∈ S_d | s/f^d ∈ 𝔮} for all d ≥ 0.\n\nEach of these is a single condition applied to one object. Then the problem is to show that Ψ(Φ(𝔭)) = 𝔭.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wants to prove the bijection between homogeneous primes in S_f and primes in S_{(f)}, but the specific crux is showing Ψ ∘ Φ is identity on the relevant primes. So the problem as per the user is to prove that Ψ ∘ Φ acts as the identity on homogeneous prime ideals of S not containing f.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions listing all these conditions, and the problem is to prove that Ψ(Φ(𝔭)) = 𝔭 for such 𝔭.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nS is a graded ring,\nf is a homogeneous element of S,\nf has positive degree,\n𝔭 is a homogeneous prime ideal of S,\n𝔭 does not contain f,\nΦ(𝔭) is the prime ideal S_f 𝔭 ∩ S_{(f)},\nΨ(𝔮) is the homogeneous ideal generated by ⋃_{d∈ℕ} {s ∈ S_d : s/f^d ∈ 𝔮} for a prime ideal 𝔮 of S_{(f)}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Ψ(Φ(𝔭)) = 𝔭.\n\nI think this captures all the necessary assumptions and the specific problem. Each assumption is a single line addressing one property. The problem is the specific statement to prove.",
