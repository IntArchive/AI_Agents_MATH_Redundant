    "Content": "Suppose that $X$ have finite measure, let $1<p<\\infty$ , and suppose that $f_n \\colon X\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a sequence of measurable functions such that $\\sup_n \\int_X |f_n|^p d\\mu < \\infty$ . Show that the sequence $f_n$ is uniformly integrable. In another word, show that $$\\sup_n \\int_X |f_n|^p d\\mu < \\infty \\;\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\\; \\sup_n \\int_{|f_n|>M} |f_n| d\\mu \\rightarrow 0 \\text{ when } M\\rightarrow \\infty.$$ I have tried using contradiction, but I am not sure how to use the power $p$ in the problem. I can see why it would work, in some sense, the power $p$ gets rid of the case often called \"escape to vertical infinity\". For example, define $f_n :[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with $f_n = n\\chi_{[0,\\frac{1}{n}]} $ , without the power $p$ , we have $$\\sup_n \\int_X |f_n| d\\mu =1 \\;\\;\\text{ and }\\;\\; \\sup_n \\int_{|f_n|>M} |f_n| d\\mu =1 \\text{ for each } M,$$ but $$\\sup_n \\int_X |f_n|^p d\\mu = \\infty$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Use the inequality $$\\chi\\{|f|>R\\}\\cdot |f(x)|\\cdot R^{p-1}\\leqslant |f(x)|^p,$$ where $\\chi(A)$ denotes the indicator function of the set $A$ . Then integrate to obtain $$\\int_{\\{|f_n|>R\\}}|f_n|\\mathrm d\\mu(x)\\leqslant R^{1-p}\\sup_k\\int_X\\left|f_k(x)\\right|^p\\mathrm d\\mu(x).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let's start by reading the original question carefully. The user is asking about showing that a sequence of functions is uniformly integrable given certain conditions. \n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states that X has finite measure. That's one assumption. Then, 1 < p < ∞. That's another. The sequence of functions f_n is measurable, and the supremum of their L^p norms is finite. Each of these should be separate assumptions. \n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"X have finite measure,\" so that's about the measure space. Then p is between 1 and infinity, not including the endpoints. The functions f_n are measurable, and their L^p integrals are uniformly bounded. Each of these is a distinct condition applied to different objects: X's measure, the exponent p, the functions f_n's measurability, and the uniform bound on their integrals. \n\nThe problem is to show that under these conditions, the sequence is uniformly integrable, which translates to showing the supremum of the integrals over the sets where |f_n| > M tends to zero as M approaches infinity.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. X has finite measure.\n2. 1 < p < ∞.\n3. f_n: X → ℝ is a sequence of measurable functions.\n4. sup_n ∫_X |f_n|^p dμ < ∞.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem statement is to show that the sequence is uniformly integrable, which is phrased in the problem's own words as the implication involving the limit of the integrals over |f_n| > M as M approaches infinity.\n\nI should make sure that all the given conditions are included. The user mentioned \"another word\" restating the problem, but in the format, the problem should be stated concisely. So the problem part here is to show that the sequence f_n is uniformly integrable, given those assumptions. Alternatively, using the user's restatement, but maybe keeping it as the original problem's request. The original problem's title is about uniform L^p bound on finite measure implying uniform integrability, so the core problem is to prove that implication.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list all these assumptions and then state the problem as proving uniform integrability. Let me check for any other conditions or possible missed points. The functions are measurable, the measure is finite, p is in (1, ∞), and the L^p norms are uniformly bounded. Yes, that's all. The example given by the user in their own problem included the specific mathematical expressions, so maybe in the problem statement here, we can include the mathematical implication as well, but maybe the problem can be phrased more succinctly. The user's original problem statement has both a general request and the mathematical implication. So maybe the problem part should be: \"Show that the sequence f_n is uniformly integrable. In other words, show that sup_n ∫_{|f_n|>M} |f_n| dμ → 0 as M → ∞.\"\n\nBut in the example, the problem was stated with the mathematical expression. So perhaps following that style. Let me check the example again. The example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem would be \"Show that the sequence f_n is uniformly integrable,\" which can be followed by the mathematical implication. Alternatively, present both, but the user's original problem includes both a general statement and the mathematical equation. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Show that the sequence f_n is uniformly integrable. In other words, show that sup_n ∫_{|f_n|>M} |f_n| dμ → 0 as M → ∞.\n\nBut to match the example, which includes the mathematical expression in the problem part, we can include the equation. Let me see how the user phrased it. The problem statement in the original question says: \"Show that the sequence f_n is uniformly integrable. In another word, show that [equation]\". So in the formatted problem, maybe include both, but the main problem is the first part, and the equation is an equivalent restatement. However, in the example, only the main problem was included with the mathematical expression. Maybe we can combine them. Alternatively, given the user's example, it's acceptable to have the problem part with the mathematical implication.\n\nSo, the problem part would be: \"Show that $$\\sup_n \\int_X |f_n|^p d\\mu < \\infty \\;\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\\; \\sup_n \\int_{|f_n|>M} |f_n| d\\mu \\rightarrow 0 \\text{ when } M\\rightarrow \\infty.$$\"\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"Show that the sequence f_n is uniformly integrable. In another word...\" So perhaps the problem is to show uniform integrability, which is equivalent to the implication. So maybe it's better to state the problem as \"Show that the sequence f_n is uniformly integrable. In other words, show that...\" to capture both. However, the example in the instruction only included the main problem and the mathematical expression. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So they took the problem as the main statement. Here, the main problem is to show uniform integrability, but the user also provided the equivalent statement. To follow the example, perhaps the problem should be phrased as the main request, including the mathematical implication.\n\nAlternatively, since the user included both, maybe we can present it as \"Show that the sequence f_n is uniformly integrable; that is, show that [equation]\". This way, the problem is one statement with an equivalent formulation.\n\nIn any case, the key is to capture all the necessary assumptions and the problem statement accurately. Let me now structure this properly.",
