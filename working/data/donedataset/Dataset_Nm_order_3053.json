    "Content": "Problem 17 of Chapter 6 of Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis asks us to prove the following: Suppose $\\alpha$ increases monotonically on $[a,b]$, $g$ is\n  continuous, and $g(x)=G'(x)$ for $a \\leq x \\leq b$. Prove that, $$\\int_a^b\\alpha(x)g(x)\\,dx=G(b)\\alpha(b)-G(a)\\alpha(a)-\\int_a^bG\\,d\\alpha.$$ It seems to me that the continuity of $g$ is not necessary for the result above. It is enough to assume that $g$ is Riemann integrable. Am I right in thinking this? I have thought as follows: $\\int_a^bG\\,d\\alpha$ exists because $G$ is differentiable and hence continuous. $\\alpha(x)$ is integrable with respect to $x$ since it is monotonic. If $g(x)$ is also integrable with respect to $x$ then $\\int_a^b\\alpha(x)g(x)\\,dx$ also exists. To prove the given formula, I start from the hint given by Rudin\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n\\alpha(x_i)g(t_i)\\Delta x_i=G(b)\\alpha(b)-G(a)\\alpha(a)-\\sum_{i=1}^nG(x_{i-1})\\Delta \\alpha_i$$\nwhere $g(t_i)\\Delta x_i=\\Delta G_i$ by the intermediate mean value theorem. Now the sum on the right-hand side converges to $\\int_a^bG\\,d\\alpha$. The sum on the left-hand side would have converged to $\\int_a^b\\alpha(x)g(x)\\,dx$ if it had been\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha(x_i)g(x_i)\\Delta x$$\nThe absolute difference between this and what we have is bounded above by\n$$\\max(|\\alpha(a)|,|\\alpha(b)|)\\sum_{i=1}^n |g(x_i)-g(t_i)|\\Delta x$$\nand this can be made arbitrarily small because $g(x)$ is integrable with respect to $x$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Compare with the following theorem, Theorem : Suppose $f$ and $g$ are bounded functions with no common discontinuities on the interval $[a,b]$, and the Riemann-Stieltjes integral of $f$ with respect to $g$ exists. Then the Riemann-Stieltjes integral of $g$ with respect to $f$ exists, and $$\\int_{a}^{b} g(x)df(x) = f(b)g(b)-f(a)g(a)-\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dg(x)\\,. $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user is asking whether the continuity of \\( g \\) is necessary for the integration by parts formula involving Riemann-Stieltjes integrals as presented in Rudin's problem. They think that instead of requiring \\( g \\) to be continuous, it's sufficient for \\( g \\) to be Riemann integrable. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall the original problem statement from Rudin. It says that \\( \\alpha \\) is monotonically increasing on \\([a, b]\\), \\( g \\) is continuous, and \\( g(x) = G'(x) \\) for \\( x \\) in \\([a, b]\\). The goal is to prove the integration by parts formula:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b \\alpha(x) g(x) \\, dx = G(b)\\alpha(b) - G(a)\\alpha(a) - \\int_a^b G \\, d\\alpha.\n\\]\n\nThe user questions if continuity of \\( g \\) is needed. Their reasoning is that since \\( G \\) is differentiable (hence continuous), \\( \\alpha \\) being monotonic ensures that \\( \\int_a^b G \\, d\\alpha \\) exists. Also, if \\( g \\) is Riemann integrable, then \\( \\int_a^b \\alpha(x) g(x) \\, dx \\) should exist. They then proceed with an argument involving Riemann sums, using the mean value theorem to relate \\( \\Delta G_i \\) to \\( g(t_i) \\Delta x_i \\), and argue that the difference between the Riemann sum with \\( g(t_i) \\) and one with \\( g(x_i) \\) can be made small due to \\( g \\) being integrable.\n\nLet me verify each part. The key here is understanding the conditions under which the Riemann-Stieltjes integral \\( \\int_a^b G \\, d\\alpha \\) exists and when the integration by parts formula holds. \n\nRudin's Theorem 6.22 states that if \\( f \\) is continuous and \\( \\alpha \\) is of bounded variation, then \\( \\int_a^b f \\, d\\alpha \\) exists. Here, \\( \\alpha \\) is monotonic, hence of bounded variation. Since \\( G \\) is differentiable, it's continuous, so \\( \\int_a^b G \\, d\\alpha \\) exists. That part checks out.\n\nNow, for the left-hand side integral \\( \\int_a^b \\alpha(x) g(x) \\, dx \\), if \\( g \\) is Riemann integrable and \\( \\alpha \\) is monotonic (hence Riemann integrable as well, since monotonic functions are Riemann integrable), then the product \\( \\alpha(x) g(x) \\) should be Riemann integrable, provided that \\( g \\) is bounded. But Riemann integrable functions are bounded by definition, so this should hold. Therefore, the integral exists if \\( g \\) is Riemann integrable.\n\nThe user's argument then uses Riemann sums. The sum on the right converges to \\( \\int_a^b G \\, d\\alpha \\). The left sum, as given in the problem, is \\( \\sum \\alpha(x_i) g(t_i) \\Delta x_i \\). The user points out that if the sum were \\( \\sum \\alpha(x_i) g(x_i) \\Delta x_i \\), then it would converge to \\( \\int \\alpha(x) g(x) \\, dx \\). The difference between these two sums is bounded by \\( \\max |\\alpha| \\sum |g(x_i) - g(t_i)| \\Delta x_i \\).\n\nSince \\( g \\) is Riemann integrable, for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), there exists a partition where the upper and lower sums differ by less than \\( \\epsilon \\). However, to make \\( \\sum |g(x_i) - g(t_i)| \\Delta x_i \\) small, we might need more than just integrability. Integrability ensures that the difference between upper and lower sums can be made small, but here we have a sum involving the oscillation of \\( g \\) over each subinterval. The term \\( |g(x_i) - g(t_i)| \\) relates to the oscillation of \\( g \\) in each subinterval. If \\( g \\) is continuous, then it's uniformly continuous on \\([a, b]\\), so the maximum difference \\( |g(x_i) - g(t_i)| \\) can be made uniformly small by choosing a fine enough partition, which would make the entire sum small. However, if \\( g \\) is merely integrable, it might have points of discontinuity, and the oscillation might not be controllable in the same way. \n\nBut wait, the user argues that because \\( g \\) is integrable, the sum \\( \\sum |g(x_i) - g(t_i)| \\Delta x_i \\) can be made small. Let me think. For Riemann integrability, it's true that the set of discontinuities has measure zero. However, the Riemann sums can still converge even if the function isn't continuous everywhere. But in this case, we are dealing with the difference between two Riemann sums: one with tags \\( t_i \\) and another with tags \\( x_i \\). If \\( g \\) is Riemann integrable, then the Riemann sum shouldn't depend on the choice of tags as long as the partition is sufficiently fine. But this is precisely the definition of Riemann integrability: for any choice of tags, the Riemann sums converge to the same integral as the mesh size goes to zero. Therefore, even if \\( g \\) is not continuous, as long as it's Riemann integrable, the difference between different tagged Riemann sums should go to zero as the partition becomes finer. \n\nWait, but the user is using a specific bound: \\( \\max |\\alpha| \\sum |g(x_i) - g(t_i)| \\Delta x_i \\). If \\( \\alpha \\) is bounded (which it is, since it's monotonic on a closed interval), then the max term is a constant. The sum \\( \\sum |g(x_i) - g(t_i)| \\Delta x_i \\) is like the integral of \\( |g(x) - g(t)| \\) over some partition. But how does that relate to integrability?\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the Riemann sum for \\( \\int \\alpha(x) g(x) dx \\), the choice of tags \\( t_i \\) versus \\( x_i \\) should not matter if \\( g \\) is integrable. The difference between the two sums would go to zero as the mesh size goes to zero. Therefore, even without continuity, the equality should hold. \n\nThus, perhaps the user is correct. The continuity of \\( g \\) is not necessary; Riemann integrability might suffice. However, I need to check if there are any subtleties I'm missing. \n\nIn the original problem, Rudin requires \\( g \\) to be continuous. Maybe because in the proof, he uses the Mean Value Theorem for derivatives to write \\( \\Delta G_i = G(x_i) - G(x_{i-1}) = g(t_i) \\Delta x_i \\). But the Mean Value Theorem requires \\( G \\) to be continuous on \\([x_{i-1}, x_i]\\) and differentiable on \\((x_{i-1}, x_i)\\). Since \\( G \\) is differentiable everywhere on \\([a, b]\\), that holds. But \\( g \\) being the derivative of \\( G \\) only needs to exist, not necessarily be continuous. However, \\( g \\) is Riemann integrable if \\( G' \\) exists everywhere and is Riemann integrable. \n\nWait, there's a theorem that states if \\( G \\) is differentiable on \\([a, b]\\) and \\( G' \\) is Riemann integrable, then \\( \\int_a^b G' dx = G(b) - G(a) \\). This is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. But in this case, \\( g = G' \\), so if \\( g \\) is Riemann integrable, then that theorem applies. \n\nSo, even if \\( g \\) is not continuous, as long as it's Riemann integrable, the steps in the proof would still hold. The key point in the user's argument is that the difference between the Riemann sums with different tags can be made small because \\( g \\) is integrable. Therefore, the continuity condition might be redundant here, and Rudin might have included it for simplicity or because he hasn't introduced the more general case where \\( g \\) is only integrable.\n\nTherefore, the user is likely correct in their assertion that continuity of \\( g \\) is not necessary and that Riemann integrability suffices. The assumptions needed are that \\( \\alpha \\) is monotonically increasing, \\( g \\) is Riemann integrable on \\([a, b]\\), and \\( g = G' \\) (so \\( G \\) is an antiderivative of \\( g \\)). Under these conditions, the integration by parts formula should hold.",
