    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided helps clarify the expectations. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving a specific logarithmic integral:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}dx = \\frac{1}{3}\\log^3(2)-\\frac{\\pi^2}{12}\\log(2)+\\frac{\\zeta(3)}{8}$$\n\nThe task is to format this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. The example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption about $n$ being an integer and divisible by 7. But in the formatted problem, only the integer part was kept. Wait, no, actually, the example original problem mentioned \"for every integer $n$\" and the formatted assumption included \"$n$ is an integer\", and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that's not correct. Wait the original problem was to prove for every integer $n$, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem in the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their example, so I have to follow their structure regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is log(1+x)log(1-x)/(1+x). The question is to prove the equality. So what assumptions are present here?\n\nIn integration problems, assumptions typically include the domain of integration, the functions involved being integrable, and any conditions needed for convergence or validity of manipulations. Here, the integral is from 0 to 1. The integrand involves log(1+x) and log(1-x). At x=1, log(1-x) becomes log(0), which is negative infinity, but since the denominator is 1+x approaching 2, the integrand behaves like log(0) which tends to -infinity. However, the integral might converge if the singularity is integrable. Similarly, at x=0, the logs are finite. So we need to check if the integral converges. But since the user says they found this result using Mathematica and asks for help proving it, maybe the convergence is assumed.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n- The functions log(1+x) and log(1-x) are defined on [0, 1).\n- The integrand is integrable on [0, 1).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. The example had \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So perhaps here, we can list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}$,\nThe functions $\\log(1+x)$ and $\\log(1-x)$ are defined on the interval [0,1),\nThe integrand is integrable on [0,1].\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant or not necessary. The problem statement itself includes the integral from 0 to 1, so perhaps the main assumption is the domain of integration. The integrability might be considered implicit since the user is asking to prove the equality, assuming the integral exists. However, to follow the example, perhaps list the integral's limits as an assumption.\n\nWait in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption that n is an integer. So here, the problem states the integral from 0 to 1, so that would be an assumption: the integral is over the interval [0,1].\n\nAdditionally, maybe the integrand's structure is an assumption. But perhaps not. The problem is to compute the integral of that specific integrand. So the problem statement itself is the integral expression. Therefore, the assumptions might just be the limits of integration and perhaps the integrability.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they included the divisibility condition as an assumption even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe in that example, the user mistakenly added an extra assumption. But regardless, I need to follow the user's format.\n\nSo, applying this to the current problem:\n\nOriginal question: Integral from 0 to 1 of [log(1+x)log(1-x)/(1+x)] dx equals the given expression.\n\nAssumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is computed over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is $\\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}$.\n- The logarithm functions are defined as real-valued functions on their respective domains.\n\nWait, but log(1-x) is defined for x < 1, so on [0,1), which is the interval of integration except at x=1. Since the integral is up to 1, but the integrand has a singularity there. However, the integral is still convergent because near x=1, log(1-x) ~ -(1-x), and the denominator is approaching 2, so the integrand behaves like -(1-x)/2 * log(2), which is integrable. Wait, no: log(1-x) ~ -(1-x) - (1-x)^2/2 - ..., so near x=1, log(1-x) ~ -(1-x). So the integrand near x=1 is approximately log(2) * [ - (1 - x) ] / 2, which is O(1 - x). Integrating O(1 - x) from near 1 to 1 is finite, since the integral of (1 - x) dx converges. Therefore, the integral is convergent. Hence, the assumption would be that the integral converges, but maybe that's considered given.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}$,\n$\\log(1+x)$ and $\\log(1-x)$ are real-valued functions on [0,1).\n\nBut maybe the last one is too much. Alternatively, perhaps no need to state the domains since the problem already specifies the integral from 0 to 1, implying the functions are defined there except at x=1, but the integral is still handled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main assumption is just the integral bounds and the integrand. Since in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's original statement. So here, the problem states the integral from 0 to 1 of that integrand, so the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is computed over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is $\\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}$.\n\nBut maybe that's redundant because the problem already states the integral. However, the example included the assumptions even though they were part of the problem statement. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption that n is an integer. So similarly, here, the integral's limits and the integrand would be assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So there's a discrepancy. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I need to follow their structure.\n\nSo perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is $\\frac{\\log(1+x) log(1-x)}{1+x}$.\n\nBut maybe more precise. Alternatively, considering the example, the user might have intended that the problem is restructured to list all conditions/assumptions that are given in the problem. Since the problem is to compute the integral, the main assumption is the integral's setup. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}dx = \\frac{1}{3}\\log^3(2)-\\frac{\\pi^2}{12}\\log(2)+\\frac{\\zeta(3)}{8}.$$\n\nBut the example included assumptions that were part of the problem's statement. So in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. However, the formatted problem in the example added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I have to follow their lead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was that the original problem had a hidden assumption, but no. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That would change the problem, making it incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the example is wrong, but the user intended to show that assumptions are extracted from the problem's conditions. So perhaps in the example, the original problem had a typo, and the correct assumption is that n is an integer.\n\nGiven that confusion, but the user provided that example, I have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is specified. Therefore, the assumptions are the integral's limits and the form of the integrand. However, in the example, they broke down the problem's conditions into assumptions. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is $\\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}$.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Thus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that  \n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log(1+x)\\log(1-x)}{1+x}dx = \\frac{1}{3}\\log^3(2)-\\frac{\\pi^2}{12}\\log(2)+\\frac{\\zeta(3)}{8}.$$\n\nBut I should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, the logarithms are real-valued, which requires their arguments to be positive. So log(1+x) is defined for x > -1, which is satisfied on [0,1]. log(1-x) is defined for x < 1, which is satisfied on [0,1). At x=1, log(1-x) is -infinity, but the integral's upper limit is 1, so it's an improper integral. Therefore, another assumption could be that the integral converges. But since the problem asks to prove the equality, convergence is assumed. However, if I follow the example, which didn't include convergence assumptions, then maybe it's not necessary here. \n\nAlternatively, if the example included conditions from the problem statement, then the assumptions here are just the integral's setup. Therefore, the final formatted problem should be as above.",
