    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original problem is about proving that if four natural numbers a, b, c, d satisfy ab = cd, then their sum a + b + c + d is composite. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The original problem states that a, b, c, d are natural numbers and that ab = cd. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is a natural number.\n2. b is a natural number.\n3. c is a natural number.\n4. d is a natural number.\n5. ab = cd.\n\nBut according to the example provided, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Wait, in the example, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. However, in this problem, the conditions are that a, b, c, d are natural numbers (each is an individual object) and the equation ab = cd.\n\nBut the example structured \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So maybe each variable's condition should be listed separately. So for each of a, b, c, d being natural numbers, that's four separate assumptions. Then the fifth assumption is ab = cd.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a natural number,\n- b is a natural number,\n- c is a natural number,\n- d is a natural number,\n- ab = cd.\n\nThen the problem statement is to prove that a + b + c + d is composite.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, no, looking back: the original example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the user provided an example where they added an assumption? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example had a mistake? Or perhaps the user made an error in the example. But according to that example, the assumptions include both the original conditions and perhaps some additional ones. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem? The original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, but 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by both 7 and 13? Or maybe the user wanted to restructure it differently. Hmm, this could be confusing.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants us to filter the original question and structure it according to the format. The original question says: Let a,b,c,d be natural numbers with ab=cd. Prove that a+b+c+d is composite. So the assumptions are a,b,c,d are natural numbers and ab=cd. Therefore, each variable being a natural number is a separate assumption, and then ab=cd is another assumption. So following the example, each assumption is listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Wait, but \"ab=cd\" is a relation between multiple objects. However, in the example, the assumption was \"n is divisible by 7\", which is a condition on n. But in the current case, \"ab=cd\" is a relation between a, b, c, d. So perhaps the example allows for such relational assumptions as a single line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a natural number,\nb is a natural number,\nc is a natural number,\nd is a natural number,\nab = cd.\n\nProblem: Prove that a + b + c + d is composite.\n\nBut let me check again. The example had:\n\nOriginal problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", so n is an integer. The formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That seems like an error in the example. Unless there was a miscommunication. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as an example of how to structure. So perhaps we need to follow that structure regardless. But in the example, they split the conditions into separate lines, even if they are about the same object. For instance, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So in the current problem, the four variables being natural numbers would each be separate lines, and the fifth line is the equation ab=cd.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be as above. However, maybe the equation ab=cd is considered a single assumption. Therefore, the answer should follow that structure.",
