    "Content": "Possible Duplicate: Distribution Functions of Measures and Countable Sets The question at hand is: Let F be a distribution function on $\\mathbb{R}$. Prove that F has at most countably many discontinuities.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Another approach: let $D$ be the set of points of discontinuity.  For each $x \\in D$ we have $F(x-) < F(x+)$ so we can choose a rational $q_x$ with $F(x-) < q_x < F(x+)$.  Since $F$ is increasing we can check that if $x \\ne y$ then $q_x \\ne q_y$.  So $x \\mapsto q_x$ is a one-to-one function from $D$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$, and $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, hence so is $D$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The task is to prove that a distribution function F on the real numbers has at most countably many discontinuities. \n\nFirst, I remember that a distribution function F is non-decreasing, right-continuous, and has limits from the left at every point. Also, the limits at negative infinity and positive infinity are 0 and 1, respectively. But the key properties here are probably the non-decreasing nature and the right-continuity.\n\nSince F is non-decreasing, I recall that monotonic functions can only have jump discontinuities. So each discontinuity point would be a jump where the left limit F(φ⁻) is less than the right limit F(φ⁺). But because F is right-continuous, the value at φ is F(φ⁺), so the jump is F(φ⁺) - F(φ⁻).\n\nNow, to count these discontinuities. Each jump is a positive number because F is non-decreasing. If we can show that there are only countably many jumps, that would suffice since countable sets are the only ones that can be put into a sequence.\n\nHow do we count them? Maybe for each positive integer n, consider the jumps of size greater than or equal to 1/n. If we can show that there are finitely many such jumps for each n, then the total number of jumps is a countable union of finite sets, hence countable.\n\nWait, let me think. If F is non-decreasing, the total sum of all jumps must be less than or equal to F(∞) - F(-∞) = 1 - 0 = 1. So for each ε > 0, the number of jumps with size greater than ε must be finite. Because if each such jump is at least ε, then the number of such jumps is at most 1/ε. For example, if ε = 1/10, then there can be at most 10 jumps of size 1/10 or more.\n\nTherefore, the set of all discontinuity points is the union over n of the set of jumps with size ≥ 1/n. Each of those sets is finite, hence their union is countable.\n\nBut let me check the user's attempt. They mentioned intervals (a,b] and summing the jumps there. They said that the sum of P(φ_k) (which I think is the jump size at φ_k) is ≤ F(b) - F(a). So in any finite interval, the number of jumps with size ≥ ε is ≤ (F(b) - F(a))/ε. Since F(b) - F(a) is bounded by the total increase over the real line, which is 1. Therefore, even in the entire real line, the number of jumps ≥ ε is ≤ 1/ε, hence finite. Then the union over all ε=1/n gives a countable set.\n\nThe user seems to be on the right track, but their original attempt might not have fully connected the dots. They restricted to a finite interval (a,b], but actually, since the entire real line's total jump is 1, we can consider the whole line instead of intervals. But maybe handling intervals is a way to deal with possible accumulation points. However, since F is defined on ℝ, which is σ-compact, we can cover ℝ with countably many intervals and apply the argument in each interval. But even without that, the total sum of jumps is bounded by 1, so for each n, the number of jumps ≥1/n is ≤ n. Thus, the total discontinuities are countable.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here are that F is a distribution function, which gives us non-decreasing, right-continuous, and limits from the left. Each discontinuity is a jump where the left limit is less than the right limit. By using the fact that the sum of jumps is bounded, we can argue countability.",
