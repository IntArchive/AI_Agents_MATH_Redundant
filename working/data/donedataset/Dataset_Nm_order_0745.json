A norm-limit of compact operators is compact so $T$ is compact. Conversely, if $T$ is compact, then you can extract from $\\{Te_n\\}$ a converging subsequence so you can extract from $\\{\\lambda_ne_n\\}$ a converging subsequence, say $\\{\\lambda_{n_k}e_{n_k}\\}$. Since $\\lVert \\lambda_{n_{k+1}}e_{n_k{+1}}-\\lambda_{n_k}e_{n_k}\\rVert^2=|\\lambda_{n_{k+1}}|^2+|\\lambda_{n_k}|^2\\to 0$, we should have $\\lambda_{n_k}\\to 0$. We thus can prove that for each subsequence $\\{\\lambda_{n_j}\\}$, we can extract that a further subsequence which converges to $0$, hence the whole sequence converges to $0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that a certain operator T on ℓ² is compact. The operator is defined by Te_k = λ_k e_k where λ_k tends to 0 as k approaches infinity. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions that T is an operator from ℓ² to ℓ². Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo, the first assumption is that T is an operator acting on ℓ² spaces, specifically T: ℓ² → ℓ². Next, the operator acts on the basis vectors e_k by scaling them with λ_k. So another assumption is that T maps each basis vector e_k to λ_k e_k. Then, there's the condition that λ_k converges to 0 as k approaches infinity. That should be the third assumption. \n\nWait, the original problem might not state that {e_k} is the standard basis, but in ℓ², it's common to assume that e_k are the standard basis vectors where e_k has 1 in the k-th position and 0 elsewhere. However, maybe I should include that as an assumption? Hmm, the problem says \"Consider T: ℓ²→ℓ² an operator such that Te_k = λ_k e_k...\" so it's given that T acts on the standard basis vectors e_k. But perhaps the user didn't specify what e_k is. However, in the context of ℓ², e_k usually denotes the canonical basis. Since the problem states it that way, maybe it's safe to assume that e_k are the standard basis vectors. But do I need to include that as an assumption? Let me check the example provided. In the example, the user had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So they broke down each condition.\n\nIn this case, the operator T is defined on ℓ², so that's one assumption. Then, T acts on each e_k (which are the standard basis vectors) by Te_k = λ_k e_k. So maybe that's another assumption. Then, the sequence λ_k converges to 0. So three separate assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user didn't explicitly state that {e_k} is the standard basis. However, in the context of ℓ², when someone refers to e_k without specification, it's typically the canonical basis. So maybe the problem assumes that, but perhaps to be thorough, should I list that as an assumption? But according to the example, the user might not include implicit assumptions unless they are critical. For example, in the original example, the user had \"n is an integer\" which was part of the problem statement. Similarly, here, the problem statement says \"Te_k = λ_k e_k\" where e_k are part of the problem's given. So maybe we need to include that T is defined on the standard basis vectors e_k. Wait, but the problem doesn't explicitly state that e_k are the standard basis vectors, but in ℓ², that's standard. Maybe the problem assumes that the user knows that e_k is the standard basis. However, to be precise, should we list that as an assumption? Let me check the example again. In the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So in this case, since the problem mentions e_k, perhaps the assumption is that {e_k} is the standard orthonormal basis of ℓ². But the problem statement might not state that explicitly. However, the user's problem says \"Consider T: ℓ²→ℓ² an operator such that Te_k=λ_k e_k...\" So the problem defines T's action on e_k, but doesn't define e_k. So maybe to make the assumptions clear, we need to include that {e_k} is the standard orthonormal basis. But the original problem didn't state that. Hmm, this is a bit of a dilemma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that e_k is some orthonormal basis, but in ℓ², the usual basis is the standard one. Since the problem is about operators diagonal with respect to the standard basis, maybe that's part of the assumptions. However, the problem as stated does not explicitly mention the basis. So perhaps in the Assumption section, I need to list:\n\n- T is a linear operator from ℓ² to ℓ².\n\n- For each k, T(e_k) = λ_k e_k, where {e_k} is the standard orthonormal basis of ℓ².\n\n- The sequence {λ_k} converges to 0 as k approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"Te_k = λ_k e_k\" with λ_k → 0. So the user is assuming that {e_k} is the standard basis. But since the problem is written in the context of ℓ², perhaps {e_k} is given as the standard basis. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. T is an operator on ℓ² (so T: ℓ² → ℓ²).\n\n2. For each k, T(e_k) = λ_k e_k (so T acts diagonally on the basis vectors).\n\n3. The sequence λ_k converges to 0 as k → ∞.\n\nThese are three separate assumptions, each applying to one object: T's domain and codomain, T's action on basis vectors, and the convergence of λ_k.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem accordingly:\n\nAssumption: \nT is a linear operator from ℓ² to ℓ²,\nFor each k, Te_k = λ_k e_k where e_k is the standard basis vector,\nThe sequence (λ_k) converges to 0 as k approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that T is compact.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the user's instruction had the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which was actually not part of the original problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which is incorrect. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the user structured it as:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in reality, the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7; it was for every integer n. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Or maybe the example was altered. Wait, perhaps the user intended to show that even if the original problem had some conditions, they were filtering unrelated information. Wait, maybe in the example, the user mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but the original problem didn't have that. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, maybe the user's example is not a good reference. Wait, but regardless, according to the user's instruction, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So perhaps in the example, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might have been part of a different problem. But in this current problem, how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was that the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was converted into an assumption \"n is an integer\", and then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But then why in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\"? That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the original example was mistyped. Let me recheck:\n\nThe user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean that n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So the example might have an error. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to show that even if the original problem had some redundant information, the formatted version should list all necessary assumptions, but in this case, the example seems flawed.\n\nBut regardless, proceeding with the current problem. The problem as stated in the Math Stack Exchange question is: \"Consider T: ℓ² → ℓ² an operator such that Te_k = λ_k e_k with λ_k → 0 as k → ∞. How to prove that it is compact?\" So the problem is to prove T is compact given those conditions.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. T is an operator from ℓ² to ℓ².\n\n2. For each k, Te_k = λ_k e_k (i.e., T acts diagonally on the standard basis vectors).\n\n3. The sequence λ_k tends to 0 as k approaches infinity.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these three assumptions, each on its own line, and then state the problem as proving T is compact.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a linear operator from ℓ² to ℓ²,\nFor each k, Te_k = λ_k e_k where e_k are the standard basis vectors,\nThe sequence (λ_k) converges to 0 as k approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that T is compact.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify that T is linear. However, in functional analysis, an operator is typically assumed to be linear unless stated otherwise. However, perhaps the problem assumes that T is linear. But since the problem statement just says \"operator\", which in some contexts can mean bounded linear operator, but sometimes just any map. However, in the context of compact operators, we are talking about linear operators. Since the problem is on Math Stack Exchange about proving an operator is compact, it's safe to assume that T is linear. Therefore, maybe the first assumption is that T is a linear operator. However, the original problem didn't explicitly state that T is linear. Hmm, this is a potential issue.\n\nWait, the problem says \"operator\" in the context of ℓ² spaces. In functional analysis, an \"operator\" usually refers to a bounded linear operator. So perhaps the linearity is implicit. However, if we are to list assumptions, should we include that T is linear? The original problem didn't state it, but perhaps it's part of the definition. In the example provided, the user didn't include implicit assumptions unless they were part of the problem's explicit statement. For example, in the original example, the problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". But in this case, the problem says \"operator\", and the user is supposed to know that in this context, operators are linear. Therefore, maybe we should include \"T is a linear operator\" as an assumption, even though it's not explicitly stated. But the problem didn't say \"linear operator\", just \"operator\". Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that T is linear, given the way it's defined on the basis vectors. Because if T is defined on each basis vector and extended linearly, then T is linear. However, if T is defined just on the basis vectors without specifying linearity, then technically T could be non-linear. But in practice, when someone defines an operator by its action on a basis, they usually mean the linear extension. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes T is linear. But to make the assumptions explicit, maybe we should list that T is a linear operator. Because in the problem statement, it's not explicitly stated. However, in the context of compact operators, we are dealing with linear operators. So the answer would be for linear operators.\n\nTherefore, to be precise, even if the problem didn't say \"linear\", we should include that T is a linear operator as an assumption. Because otherwise, the problem might be ill-posed. Therefore, the first assumption is \"T is a linear operator from ℓ² to ℓ²\". Then the second assumption is the action on the basis vectors, and third the convergence of λ_k to 0.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a linear operator from ℓ² to ℓ²,\nFor each k, Te_k = λ_k e_k where e_k are the standard basis vectors,\nThe sequence (λ_k) converges to 0 as k approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that T is compact.\n\nYes, this seems accurate. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove compactness.",
