    "Content": "Prove that $2xy\\mid x^2+y^2-x$ implies $x$ is a perfect square. My work: $2xy\\mid x^2+y^2-x \\implies x^2+y^2-x=2xy\\cdot k$ So,$x^2+y^2+2xy-x=(x+y)^2-x=2xy \\cdot (k+1)$ And,$x^2+y^2-2xy-x=(x-y)^2-x=2xy \\cdot (k-1)$ I found that for $x,y$ both odd, no solution exists. For $x$ even, and $y$ odd,no solution exists. Solution exists only for $x$ odd, $y$ even and $x$ even and $y$ even solution exists. Cannot do anything more. Please help!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We use the following Fact: A non-zero integer is a perfect square (by that I mean a number of the form $k^2$ or $-k^2$) if and only if in its prime factorization, the exponent of every prime factor is even. Now let $p$ be any prime factor of $x$ and $k$ the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $x$. If $k$ is even, there is nothing to show. So assume that $k$ is odd: $k=2j+1$. Then $p^k|x|2xy|x^2+y^2-x$. Since $p^k|x^2-x$, it must also hold that $p^{2j+1}=p^k|y^2$. Since $y^2$ is a square, also $p^{k+1}=p^{2j+2}|y^2$. But then $p^{k+1}|2xy|x^2+y^2-x$. But since $p^{k+1}|x^2+y^2$, it also follows that $p^{k+1}|x$. This is a contradiction (we assumed that $k$ is the exponent of $p$ in the factorization of $x$). Since $p$ was an arbitrary prime factor, the exponents of all prime factors in the prime factorization of $x$ are even, i.e. $x$ is a square in the above sense. Edit: Made precise what is meant by a square.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"Prove that $2xy\\mid x^2+y^2-x$ implies $x$ is a perfect square.\" The question body adds some details about the user's work, where they manipulated the divisibility condition into different forms and considered cases based on the parity of x and y. However, the key part is the original problem statement in the title.\n\nThe task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. In the example, assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the original assumption is that 2xy divides x² + y² - x. The conclusion to prove is that x must be a perfect square.\n\nSo the main assumption here is the divisibility condition. However, do we need to consider any other implicit assumptions? For example, in number theory problems, variables are often assumed to be positive integers unless stated otherwise. The user's work mentions cases where x and y are odd or even, which suggests that x and y are integers. But does the original problem explicitly state that x and y are integers? The title doesn't say, but in the context of divisibility, it's standard to assume x and y are integers. However, to be precise, maybe we should include that as an assumption.\n\nWait, the example given by the user didn't include the divisibility by 7 in the original problem but added it as an assumption. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is different. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Maybe the example was incorrect. But the user provided that as their example. So perhaps the user intended that sometimes the original problem might have conditions that are not explicitly stated but need to be listed as assumptions. But in the given example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which is the assumption, but the formatted problem splits it into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that contradicts the original problem. Hmm, maybe the example is wrong. Or maybe the original problem had an error. But regardless, the user provided that example as how they want the formatting to be done.\n\nSo, going back to the current problem: the original problem is \"Prove that $2xy\\mid x^2+y^2-x$ implies $x$ is a perfect square.\" The user's formatted problem in the example split the assumptions into each condition. So here, the main assumption is the divisibility condition. However, variables in number theory problems are typically assumed to be positive integers unless otherwise stated, but maybe we need to make that explicit. The user's work mentions x and y being even or odd, which again implies integers. So, perhaps the assumptions should include that x and y are integers. But the original problem statement doesn't specify that. So do we need to include it? The example given by the user includes assumptions even if they are part of the original problem's statement. For instance, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was split into an assumption. So, in the current problem, if the original problem says \"implies x is a perfect square\" without stating the domain of x and y, but the context implies integers, then we should list \"x and y are integers\" as assumptions.\n\nWait, but the original problem is \"Prove that $2xy\\mid x^2+y^2-x$ implies $x$ is a perfect square.\" So the problem is saying that if 2xy divides x² + y² - x, then x is a perfect square. But in order for divisibility to make sense, x and y must be integers. So, perhaps the assumptions are that x and y are integers, and 2xy divides x² + y² - x. Then the problem is to show x is a perfect square. However, in the example provided, the user split each assumption line by line. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumption 1: x is an integer.\n\nAssumption 2: y is an integer.\n\nAssumption 3: 2xy divides x² + y² - x.\n\nProblem: Prove that x is a perfect square.\n\nBut maybe the original problem is only given that 2xy divides x² + y² - x, and we need to assume x and y are integers. But since the problem is about divisibility, it's necessary to specify that x and y are integers. However, the original problem didn't state that explicitly. But in mathematical contexts, divisibility is considered in integers. So, perhaps the user expects that the assumptions include x and y being integers. But in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was split into an assumption. So, if the current problem's original statement didn't specify x and y are integers, but the problem is about divisibility, we need to include that as an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\nx is an integer,\n\ny is an integer,\n\n2xy divides x² + y² - x.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that x is a perfect square.\n\nBut looking back at the user's example, in the original problem, \"for every integer n\" was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" (which was incorrect). Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example was actually different. Maybe there was a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user provided it as a correct example. So, following that example, perhaps in the current problem, even if the original problem didn't state that x and y are integers, we need to include them as assumptions. Because in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So in the current problem, even if it's not explicitly stated, if the context implies x and y are integers, we need to list them as assumptions. So, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nx is an integer,\n\ny is an integer,\n\n2xy divides x² + y² - x.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that x is a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem does not state that x and y are integers, but the problem is about divisibility, so we must assume they are integers. Therefore, the assumptions are x and y are integers, and 2xy divides x² + y² - x. The problem is to prove x is a perfect square.\n\nIn the user's example, they split the problem's given conditions into separate assumptions. So here, similarly, the divisibility condition is one assumption, and the integrality of x and y are separate assumptions. So that seems correct.",
