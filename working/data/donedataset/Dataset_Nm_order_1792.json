    "AcceptedAnswer": "We'll first prove the easier statement that there exists at least one root, which is the one in your book, but we can do better than that. Assume to the contrary that $f$ has no roots in $\\Bbb{C}$ . We can therefore construct the following function $g_r(s): I \\to S^1$ for each $r \\in \\Bbb{R}$ : $$g_r(s) = \\frac{f(re^{2\\pi is})/f(r)}{|f(re^{2\\pi is})/f(r)|}$$ Notice how $g_r(0) = g_r(1) = 1$ and it is continuous, so it forms a closed loop in $S^1$ , whose fundamental group we know to be isomorphic to the infinite group generated by a single generator, i.e. $\\mathbb{Z}$ . We also know, however that $g_r(s) = g(r,s)$ is continuous in $r$ , so as $r$ varies we get a homotopy between $g_r(s)$ and $g_{0}(s)$ given by $H_r(s,t) = g_{tr}(s)$ . But $g_0(s) = \\frac{f(0)/f(0)}{|f(0)/f(0)|} = 1$ , and is therfore constant, and a constant loop is the class of $0 \\in \\pi_1(S^1)$ , implying $[g_r] = 0$ . Now lets fix some $r_0 >\\max( \\sum |a_i|,1)$ . For all $x$ on the circle of radius $r_0$ (i.e., $|x| = r_0$ ) we have the following: $$|x^n| = r_0^n = r_0\\cdot r_0^{n-1} > (\\sum |a_i|)|x^{n-1}| \\geq |a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0|$$ Because $|x^n| > t|a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0|$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$ , the polynomial $$f_t(x) = x^n + t(a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0)$$ has no roots on the circle of radius $r_0$ . And we can define the homotopy: $$g_{r_0,t}(s):= \\frac{f_t(r_0e^{2\\pi is})/f_t(r_0)}{|f_t(r_0e^{2\\pi is})/f_t(r_0)|}$$ Lets notice that $g_{r_0,1} = g_{r_0}$ and $g_{r_0,0} = \\omega_n$ , the loop that winds $n$ times around the origin, because $$g_{r_0,0}(s) = \\frac{r_0^ne^{2\\pi nis}/r_0^n}{|r_0^n/r_0^n|} = e^{2\\pi nis} ,\\;\\text{for } s\\in[0,1]$$ And this is an homotop between $ g_{r_0,1}$ and $\\omega_n$ . Finally we have that $[\\omega_n] = [g_{r_0,1}] = [g_{r_0}] = 0$ but this implies $n=0$ , contrary to assumption that $f$ is non constant. The stronger proof simply follows from using $f'(x) = f(x)/(x-c)$ given the root $c$ found in the prequel until the degree of the polynomial is 0. I've tried to flesh out all of the details in order to guide through the proof as much as possible. If there's anything I can clarify let me know.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want me to act as a bilingual mathematics professor, specifically handling problems from Math Stack Exchange. The task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem into the given format with assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and the problem is restated concisely.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had a divisibility condition for all integers n, but in the formatted version, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. This makes me think that maybe the user wants me to extract implicit assumptions from the problem or clarify any conditions that are necessary but not explicitly stated. However, in the given example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but it was added as an assumption. Wait, that seems odd. Let me check again. The original problem states \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem includes an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. Wait, no. Let me look again. The original problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But wait, 91 is 7*13. Maybe the user intended to break down the problem into cases where n is divisible by 7 and 13? Or perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Hmm, this might be a red flag. But perhaps the example was an incorrect structuring, but the user wants me to follow that format regardless. The key point is that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nNow, the current problem to format is from Math Stack Exchange titled \"Fundamental theorem of Algebra using fundamental groups.\" The question is asking for help understanding a proof using fundamental groups. The user wants me to structure this problem into the specified format.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The original problem is about proving the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) using fundamental groups. The user tried to do this but is stuck. So, what are the assumptions here? The FTA states that every non-constant polynomial has a complex root. To prove this using fundamental groups, certain topological concepts are involved. \n\nPossible assumptions:\n- The proof is approached using fundamental groups (method assumption).\n- The polynomial is non-constant (as FTA applies to non-constant polynomials).\n- The polynomial has complex coefficients (since FTA is about complex roots).\n- The fundamental group of the circle is known (perhaps as ℤ, which is used in such proofs).\n- The existence of a polynomial without roots leads to a contradiction in the fundamental group setup.\n\nEach of these should be listed as separate assumptions, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\n1. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is being proven using fundamental groups.\n2. The polynomial under consideration is non-constant.\n3. The polynomial has coefficients in the complex numbers.\n4. The fundamental group of the circle S¹ is isomorphic to ℤ.\n5. A non-constant polynomial with no roots in ℂ would induce a certain map on fundamental groups.\n\nBut wait, some of these might be part of the problem's context rather than assumptions. The original question is that the user tried to prove FTA using fundamental groups but can't understand the proof. So the problem is to explain or help them understand that proof. But according to the user's example, the formatted problem should list assumptions and then the problem. The example took the original problem, which was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in reality, the original problem didn't have that assumption. This might indicate that the example was incorrect, but the user wants me to follow it regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was from a different problem where n was supposed to be divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state it, hence adding that as an assumption. But that would be incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. For instance, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which contradicts \"for every integer n.\" That suggests that maybe the example is flawed. However, the user is providing that example as guidance, so I need to follow the structure even if the example is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, how to structure the current problem. The problem is about proving FTA using fundamental groups, and the user is stuck. So the assumptions would be the necessary conditions or properties used in such a proof. For example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Fundamental groups are used as the primary tool for the proof.\n- Polynomials considered are non-constant.\n- Polynomials have complex coefficients.\n- The fundamental group of the punctured plane is known.\n- A non-vanishing polynomial would allow contraction of loops.\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLet me think again. When proving FTA using fundamental groups, a common approach is to assume that a polynomial p(z) has no roots, then consider the map from the complex plane to the complex plane minus zero, and analyze the induced map on fundamental groups. If p(z) has no roots, then p(z) is a map from ℂ to ℂ\\{0}, which has a nontrivial fundamental group. However, for a polynomial of degree n, the induced map on the fundamental groups would be trivial if n=0, but since the polynomial is non-constant, degree is at least 1. This leads to a contradiction because the induced map on the fundamental group (which is ℤ) would send the generator to n times the generator, but if there's no root, the map can be contracted, leading to the induced map being zero, hence n=0, contradiction.\n\nSo the assumptions for such a proof would include:\n\n1. The polynomial p(z) is non-constant.\n2. p(z) has complex coefficients.\n3. The fundamental group of ℂ \\ {0} is ℤ.\n4. If p(z) has no roots, then p induces a continuous map from ℂ to ℂ \\ {0}.\n5. The induced homomorphism on fundamental groups by a polynomial of degree n is multiplication by n.\n6. A contractible space has trivial fundamental group.\n\nBut each of these should be separate assumptions. However, some of these are standard results in algebraic topology. The problem is that the user is trying to understand the proof, so the assumptions might be the ones used in the proof that they are stuck on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is simply to prove FTA using fundamental groups, and the assumptions are the prerequisites for that proof. But the user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which suggests that perhaps the formatted problem should include both the original problem's conditions and any necessary assumptions that are implicit.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem was split into cases where n is divisible by 7 and 13, but the original problem didn't specify that. That seems like a mistake. However, the user might have intended that the assumptions are the conditions needed for the problem, which in the example, perhaps the problem was actually for n divisible by 7, but the original statement was incorrect. Alternatively, the example might have been a mistake, but the user wants the format where assumptions are listed, even if they are redundant.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions would include the standard conditions needed for the proof using fundamental groups. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial is non-constant.\nThe polynomial is complex-coefficient.\nThe fundamental group of the circle is ℤ.\nA non-vanishing polynomial induces a map from ℂ to ℂ \\ {0}.\nThe induced map on fundamental groups by such a polynomial would be trivial if the polynomial extends to a map on the Riemann sphere.\nThe fundamental group of a contractible space is trivial.\n\nBut again, each assumption should be one line, one property per object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to be the given conditions in the problem. Since the problem is \"Prove FTA using fundamental groups,\" the assumptions would be the prerequisites for the proof, but the user might not list them all. However, the example shows that the formatted problem added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, which suggests that perhaps the user is mistaken, but I should follow the example's structure regardless.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to extract any explicit assumptions from the problem statement. The problem here is \"Prove the fundamental theorem of algebra using fundamental groups.\" The user tried and can't understand the proof. The question is asking for help. So the problem is to explain or provide the proof. However, in the format, we need to structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove FTA using fundamental groups. The user is stuck.\n\nFormatted problem should have assumptions and the problem. The assumptions would be the conditions necessary for the proof. For example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The fundamental theorem of algebra states every non-constant complex polynomial has a root.\n- Fundamental groups are used to show a contradiction.\n- If a polynomial has no roots, it induces a map from the plane to the punctured plane.\n- The fundamental group of the punctured plane is ℤ.\n- The induced map on fundamental groups by a degree n polynomial is nontrivial.\n\nBut each of these should be separate lines, each addressing one property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the components of the proof. However, given the example, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions. The original problem didn't specify any conditions beyond using fundamental groups. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof uses fundamental groups.\nThe polynomial is non-constant.\nThe polynomial has complex coefficients.\nProblem:\nProve the fundamental theorem of algebra using fundamental groups.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the mathematical prerequisites, like knowledge that the fundamental group of the circle is ℤ, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the example, where assumptions were added that were not in the original problem, perhaps I should list the necessary assumptions for the proof. For the FTA proof using fundamental groups, the key steps are:\n\n1. Assume a non-constant polynomial p(z) with no roots.\n2. Then p: ℂ → ℂ \\ {0}.\n3. ℂ is contractible, so its fundamental group is trivial.\n4. ℂ \\ {0} has fundamental group ℤ.\n5. The induced map p_*: π₁(ℂ) → π₁(ℂ \\ {0}) must be trivial (since π₁(ℂ) is trivial).\n6. But for large loops, p(z) acts like z^n, which induces multiplication by n on π₁(S¹) ≅ ℤ.\n7. This leads to a contradiction unless n=0, hence p(z) must have a root.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n- The polynomial p(z) is non-constant.\n- p(z) has no roots in ℂ.\n- The fundamental group of ℂ (contractible space) is trivial.\n- The fundamental group of ℂ \\ {0} is isomorphic to ℤ.\n- The induced map on fundamental groups by a polynomial of degree n is multiplication by n.\n- A contradiction arises if such a map is both trivial and non-trivial.\n\nBut each of these needs to be one line per assumption. However, some of these are part of the proof steps rather than assumptions. The user's example might have included an incorrect assumption (n divisible by 7), but perhaps the actual assumptions for the original problem (divisible by 91) would be that 91 divides the expression, but that's the problem statement. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions that are given or necessary for the problem. In the current problem, the user is trying to prove FTA using fundamental groups. The assumptions would be the hypotheses needed for that approach. The standard assumptions for such a proof are:\n\n1. The polynomial is non-constant.\n2. The polynomial has complex coefficients.\n3. The fundamental group of the punctured complex plane (ℂ \\ {0}) is ℤ.\n4. The fundamental group of the entire complex plane (ℂ) is trivial.\n5. A non-vanishing polynomial would induce a continuous map ℂ → ℂ \\ {0}.\n6. Induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups must be compatible with the maps.\n\nEach of these can be listed as separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove FTA using these assumptions.\n\nSo, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial $p(z)$ is non-constant.\nThe polynomial $p(z)$ has complex coefficients.\nThe fundamental group of $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe fundamental group of $\\mathbb{C}$ is trivial.\nIf $p(z)$ has no roots, then $p: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is continuous.\nA continuous map induces a homomorphism between fundamental groups.\nProblem:\nProve the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using fundamental groups.\n\nThis seems to align with the example format, listing each assumption line by line. Each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. For example, each line refers to a different object (polynomial, fundamental group of ℂ\\{0}, etc.) and a single property.",
