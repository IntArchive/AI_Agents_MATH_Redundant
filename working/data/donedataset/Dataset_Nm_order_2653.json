    "Content": "We all know the geometric proofs for $$\\lim _{x\\to0}\\frac{\\sin(x)}x=1$$ can we find one based on purely functional definition? For example, let's take Apostol's definition: $\\sin (x)$ and $\\cos (x)$ are defined for all $x \\in \\mathbb R$ . $\\cos (0) = \\sin (\\frac{\\pi}2) = 1$ and $\\cos (\\pi) = -1$ . $\\cos (y-x) = \\cos y \\cos x + \\sin x \\sin y$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb R ^2$ . and there is a fourth one used to get the limit: $0 < \\cos (x) < \\frac {\\sin (x)}x <1$ for $0 < x< \\frac{\\pi}2$ . Do we always need this fourth one? Is that limit really unobtainable without geometry? It seems to me we can't reach all values of sine and cosine with just the three properties, as we can only define $\\aleph _0$ values for $\\cos (x)$ , but could we change the fourth one for \" $\\cos(x)$ is continuous\" or something similar and derive the fundamental limit? Notice that in the use of the Taylor expansion we're already assuming the limit to be one as we are using the derivative of $\\sin(x)$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This question is related to this one . Any definition that allows a uniqueness proof should let us prove the desired limit. It turns out that continuity is not required for this. So long as we carefully specify the wavelength in terms of $\\pi$ , along with the Pythagorean and angle sum and identities, we can prove uniqueness. In particular, it can be proven that there exists a unique pair of functions $(\\cos,\\sin)$ mapping $\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ which satisfy the following conditions. The Pythagorean identity $\\cos(x)^2+\\sin(x)^2=1$ The angle sum formulae $$\\cos(x+y)=\\cos(x)\\cos(y)-\\sin(x)\\sin(y)$$ $$\\sin(x+y)=\\sin(x)\\cos(y)+\\cos(x)\\sin(y)$$ The wavelength condition, $\\sin(\\pi)=0$ while $0<\\sin(x)$ for any $x\\in(0,\\pi)$ By proving that this characterization is unique, and that the ordinary Taylor series for $(\\cos,\\sin)$ satisfies all these conditions, we prove the desired limit and much more. The proofs of these claims can be found below. We first show that the functions $(\\cos,\\sin)$ , if they exist, are unique. To do this, we translate our four conditions into a more manageable state. Define the function $H(x)=\\cos(x)+i\\sin(x)$ , which has real part $\\Re(H(x))=\\cos(x)$ and imaginary part $\\Im(H(x))=\\sin(x)$ . Using this definition, our conditions are point by point equivalent to the following. $|H(x)|=1$ $H(x+y)=H(x)H(y)$ $H(\\pi)\\in\\mathbb{R}$ while $\\Im(H(x))>0$ for any $x\\in(0,\\pi)$ . To show $(\\cos,\\sin)$ is unique, we instead prove that $H$ is unique. Since $H(\\pi)\\in\\mathbb{R}$ has $|H(\\pi)|=1$ , then $H(\\frac{\\pi}{2})^4=H(\\pi)^2=1$ , so that $H(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\in\\{1,i,-1,-i\\}$ . Since $\\Im(H(\\frac{\\pi}{2}))>0$ , then $H(\\frac{\\pi}{2})=i$ . Using this, we find that $H(x+\\frac{\\pi}{2})=H(x)H(\\frac{\\pi}{2})=iH(x)$ , thus $\\sin(x+\\frac{\\pi}{2})=\\cos(x)$ and likewise $\\cos(x+\\frac{\\pi}{2})=-\\sin(x)$ . It follows that for $x\\in(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ we have $\\sin(x)>0$ and $\\cos(x)=\\sin(x+\\frac{\\pi}{2})>0$ , thus $H(x)$ is in the first quadrant. For $x\\in(\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi)$ , we have $H(x-\\frac{\\pi}{2})=-iH(x)$ in the first quadrant, thus $H(x)$ is in the second quadrant. Continuing like this, any $x\\in(\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2})$ has $H(x)$ in the third quadrant, and likewise any $x\\in(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},2\\pi)$ has $H(x)$ in the fourth quadrant. Since $H(2\\pi)=H(\\pi)^2=1$ , then $H(x+2\\pi)=H(x)$ , so the quadrant of $H(x)$ is entirely determined by $x$ . Let $H_1,H_2$ be two functions satisfying our conditions, then we prove $H_1=H_2$ . Let $I(x)=\\frac{H_1(x)}{H_2(x)}$ , and notice that $|I(x)|=\\frac{|H_1(x)|}{|H_2(x)|}=1$ , and likewise $I(x+y)=\\frac{H_1(x)H_1(y)}{H_2(x)H_2(y)}=I(x)I(y)$ . Therefore if we let $C(x)=\\Re(I(x))$ and $S(x)=\\Im(I(x))$ , the pair $(C,S)$ satisfy our conditions 1 and 2. Since $H_1$ and $H_2$ are always in the same quadrant, and $H_1=H_2\\cdot I$ , we must have $\\Re(I(x))>0$ for all $x$ , thus $C(x)>0$ . Let $\\sigma$ be the infimum value of $C(x)$ , and notice the following. $$C(x) \\geq C(x)^2 = \\frac{(2C(x)^2-1)+1}{2} = \\frac{C(2x)+1}{2} \\geq \\frac{\\sigma+1}{2}$$ The first inequality holds since $C(x)\\in (0,1]$ , where $C(x)\\leq 1$ follows from the Pythagorean identity. The equalities after that follow from a basic rearrangement of the double angle formula (derived from conditions 1 and 2 on $I$ ). The last inequality follows from $C(2x)\\geq \\sigma$ . Since $\\sigma$ is the infimum of $C(x)$ , and $C(x)\\geq\\frac{\\sigma+1}{2}$ , it follows that $\\sigma\\geq \\frac{\\sigma+1}{2}$ , which is equivalent to $\\sigma\\geq 1$ . It follows that $C(x)\\geq 1$ for all $x$ , but since $C(x)\\leq 1$ then $C(x)=1$ for all $x$ , therefore $S(x)^2=1-C(x)^2 = 0$ so that $I(x)=1$ is constant, proving $H_1=H_2$ . To finish our demonstration, let $\\cos,\\sin$ be defined by the usual Taylor series, then we show that these satisfy our conditions, and are thus the unique solution. As some preliminary observations, notice that by the Taylor series we have $\\sin(-x)=-\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(-x)=\\cos(x)$ . Let $\\exp$ be the natural exponential function defined by its power series for any complex number, which has $\\exp(0)=1$ . Euler's formula comes out very quickly from this, that $\\exp(ix)=\\cos(x)+i\\sin(x)$ . We can also prove the product formula for exponentials $\\exp(x+y)=\\exp(x)\\exp(y)$ , which works even if $x,y$ are complex numbers. A simple consequence of the above observations is that $\\exp(i(x+y))=\\exp(ix)\\exp(iy)$ . Since $H(x)=\\cos(x)+i\\sin(x)=\\exp(ix)$ , this proves $H(x+y)=H(x)H(y)$ , condition 2, the angle sum formulas. Applying the negative angle formulas, we find that $H(-x)=\\overline{H(x)}$ is the complex conjugate, thus $1=H(0)=H(x)H(-x)=|H(x)|^2$ proves condition 1, the Pythagorean identity. Previously we showed that if some function $I$ satisfied our conditions 1 and 2, and also obeyed $\\Re(I(x))>0$ , then $I$ would be constant. By the contrapositive, since $H$ is not constant, $H$ fails one of the three premises. Since $H$ satisfies conditions 1 and 2, it must be the case that some $x$ has $\\Re(H(x))\\leq 0$ , that is to say, $\\cos(x)\\leq 0$ . Since $\\cos$ is even, we can assume that $x\\geq 0$ . Now we can take the infimum $\\ell=\\inf\\{x\\geq 0 : \\cos(x)\\leq 0\\}$ . Due to continuity and $\\cos(0)=1$ , we must have $\\ell>0$ . Taking the limit from the right side, $\\cos(\\ell)\\leq 0$ , but taking a limit from the left side, we instead get $\\cos(\\ell)\\geq 0$ , so in fact $\\cos(\\ell)=0$ . Now we get the following. $$\\sin(2\\ell)=2\\sin(\\ell)\\cos(\\ell)=0$$ As above, there exists $x>0$ for which $\\sin(x)=0$ , namely $x=2\\ell$ . Let $\\lambda=\\inf\\{x>0 : \\sin(x)=0\\}$ , and notice that since $\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}=1>0$ by the Taylor series, then $\\lambda>0$ . By continuity we get $\\sin(\\lambda)=0$ , and since $\\sin$ is positive in a right-side neighborhood of $0$ , then all $x\\in(0,\\lambda)$ must have $\\sin(x)>0$ . Now we just prove $\\lambda=\\pi$ . Recall that $H(x)=\\cos(x)+i\\sin(x)$ has $|H(x)|=1$ for all $x$ , thus $H$ stays on the unit circle. More specifically for $x\\in(0,\\lambda)$ we have $\\Im(H(x))>0$ , so on this range, $H$ stays on the upper half unit circle. Analyzing the taylor series, we find that $\\frac{d}{dt}\\cos(t)=-\\sin(t)$ , so for $t\\in(0,\\lambda)$ we have $\\frac{d}{dt}\\cos(t)=-\\sin(t)<0$ , thus $\\cos$ is strictly decreasing, so $H(x)$ is injective over $t\\in[0,\\lambda]$ . Since $H(0)=1$ while $H(\\lambda)=-1$ , by continuity $H(x)$ is surjective to the upper half unit circle over $x\\in[0,\\lambda]$ . It follows that over the range $[0,\\lambda]$ , we have $H$ smoothly and bijectively parametrizing the upper half unit circle. We can therefore calculate $\\pi$ as follows. $$\\pi = \\int_0^\\lambda \\left|\\frac{d}{dt}H(t)\\right|dt = \\int_0^\\lambda \\left|\\frac{d}{dt}\\exp(it)\\right|dt = \\int_0^\\lambda |i\\exp(it)|dt = \\int_0^\\lambda 1dt = \\lambda$$ Indeed, if we consider $t$ to be time, then $H(t)$ traces the upper half unit circle, with its velocity being the derivative $\\frac{d}{dt}H(t)$ . The magnitude of the velocity is its speed, so by integrating over the speed, we produce the total length of the path traveled, which is the arclength of the upper half unit circle, exactly $\\pi$ . Since the integral reduces to $\\lambda$ , then $\\lambda=\\pi$ , proving that our $(\\cos,\\sin)$ satisfy condition 3.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user is asking if we can prove the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0 equals 1 using a functional definition of sine, like Apostol's, without relying on geometric proofs. They mentioned Apostol's four properties and wonder if the fourth one (the inequality 0 < cos(x) < sin(x)/x < 1 for 0 < x < π/2) is necessary or if it can be replaced with something else, like continuity of cosine.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Apostol's definitions. He defines sin and cos for all real numbers. The key properties given are:\n1. cos(0) = sin(π/2) = 1\n2. cos(π) = -1\n3. The identity cos(y - x) = cos y cos x + sin x sin y for all x, y.\n4. The inequality 0 < cos(x) < sin(x)/x < 1 for 0 < x < π/2.\n\nThe question is whether we can drop the fourth condition and replace it with continuity of cosine (or some other condition) and still derive the limit lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1.\n\nHmm. Let me think. If we remove the fourth condition, we lose the direct relationship between cos(x) and sin(x)/x in the inequality. But if we add continuity of cosine, maybe we can derive the limit. Alternatively, maybe using the other three properties plus continuity can lead us to the limit.\n\nWait, but Apostol's approach uses that inequality to establish the limit. Without that, how else can we approach it? Let's see. The third condition is the cosine of a difference formula. Maybe we can use that identity to derive some properties.\n\nSuppose we take y = x in the cosine difference formula. Wait, cos(y - x) = cos(0) = 1. So substituting y = x, we get cos(0) = cos x cos x + sin x sin x. Therefore, cos^2 x + sin^2 x = 1. So that's the Pythagorean identity. So that's derived from the third condition.\n\nSo we have the Pythagorean identity. Now, if we have continuity of cosine, maybe we can use that along with the other properties.\n\nBut how to get the derivative or the limit? The user mentions that in the Taylor expansion, we assume the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), which in turn requires knowing the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0.\n\nAlternatively, if we can show that sin(x) is differentiable at 0 with derivative 1, that would give the limit. But to do that, we need to evaluate lim_{x→0} (sin(x) - sin(0))/x = lim sin(x)/x. So we need to show this limit is 1.\n\nBut without the inequality, can we use continuity and the other properties?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. Maybe using the Taylor series is circular because they depend on derivatives, which depend on the limit. So we need another way.\n\nSuppose we use the identity cos(y - x) = cos y cos x + sin x sin y. Let's set y = 0. Then cos(-x) = cos 0 cos x + sin x sin 0. Since cos(-x) = cos x, and sin 0 = 0, this gives cos x = cos 0 cos x, which holds because cos 0 = 1. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, set x = 0. Then cos(y - 0) = cos y cos 0 + sin 0 sin y. Which simplifies to cos y = cos y * 1 + 0, which is true. Again, not helpful.\n\nMaybe consider small x. Let's consider the limit as x approaches 0 of sin(x)/x. Let's denote L = lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x. If we can express L in terms of other properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the continuity of cosine. Suppose we know that cosine is continuous. Then, from the Pythagorean identity, sin(x)^2 = 1 - cos(x)^2. So as x approaches 0, cos(x) approaches cos(0) = 1, so sin(x) approaches 0. Therefore, sin(x)/x is 0/0 indeterminate form, which requires L'Hospital's Rule. But to use L'Hospital's Rule, we need the derivatives of sin(x) and x, which again require knowing the derivative of sin(x) at 0, which is the limit we're trying to find. So that's circular.\n\nAlternatively, can we use the addition formulas to derive a differential equation?\n\nWait, Apostol in his calculus book actually derives the properties of sine and cosine using these functional definitions. Let me recall. He uses the four properties, including the inequality, to establish the limit. Then, using that, he shows the derivatives. So the inequality is crucial in his approach.\n\nBut the question is, can we replace the fourth condition with continuity of cosine? Let's see.\n\nSuppose instead of the inequality, we assume cosine is continuous at 0. Then, since cos(0) = 1, continuity would imply that lim_{x→0} cos(x) = 1. Then, from the Pythagorean identity, lim_{x→0} sin(x)^2 = 1 - 1 = 0, so lim sin(x) = 0. So sin(x)/x as x→0 is 0/0. But we need more than continuity here. Maybe we can use the addition formula to find a relation.\n\nLet me try to compute the derivative of sin(x) at 0. The derivative is lim_{h→0} [sin(h) - sin(0)]/h = lim sin(h)/h. So we need to compute this limit.\n\nSuppose we take the sine addition formula. We can write sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b. But I don't know if that's available here. Wait, in Apostol's definitions, we have the cosine addition formula, but not the sine addition formula. However, from the cosine difference formula, perhaps we can derive sine addition.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to use the cosine difference formula to find an expression for sin(x). Maybe express sin(x) in terms of cosine functions.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity for cos(y - x) and set y = h and x = 0, so cos(h - 0) = cos h cos 0 + sin 0 sin h. Which gives cos h = cos h * 1 + 0, which is trivial.\n\nAlternatively, set y = h and x = h, so cos(0) = cos^2 h + sin^2 h. Again, gives the Pythagorean identity.\n\nNot helpful for the limit.\n\nAlternatively, take y = x + h and use the difference formula.\n\nWait, let's consider the difference quotient for cosine. Let's compute lim_{h→0} [cos(x + h) - cos x]/h. Using the cosine addition formula, cos(x + h) = cos x cos h - sin x sin h. Therefore, [cos(x + h) - cos x]/h = [cos x (cos h - 1) - sin x sin h]/h. Taking the limit as h→0, if we know that lim_{h→0} (cos h - 1)/h = 0 and lim_{h→0} sin h /h = 1, then the derivative of cos x would be -sin x. But this requires knowing the limit lim sin h /h =1, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nThis seems circular. So if we don't have that limit, how else can we proceed?\n\nWait, maybe if we assume that cosine is differentiable at 0. Then, the derivative of cosine at 0 is lim_{h→0} [cos h - cos 0]/h = lim [cos h -1]/h. If we can show that this limit is 0, then we could use that in conjunction with other identities.\n\nBut how to show that [cos h -1]/h →0 as h→0? If we have the Pythagorean identity, then [cos h -1]/h = [ - sin^2 h ] / [h (1 + cos h)]. Because cos h -1 = -2 sin^2 (h/2), but perhaps that's getting too much into trigonometric identities which might rely on the limit we're trying to find.\n\nAlternatively, if we can bound [cos h -1]/h in some way. For example, if we can show that |cos h -1| ≤ h^2/2, then [cos h -1]/h would be bounded by h/2, which goes to 0. But to show that |cos h -1| ≤ h^2/2, we might need the Taylor series expansion of cosine, which again requires knowing the derivatives, which depend on the limit. So that's circular.\n\nAlternatively, can we use the continuity of cosine and the Pythagorean identity to derive some inequality? Suppose we have continuity, so cos h approaches 1 as h→0. Then, from sin^2 h = 1 - cos^2 h = (1 - cos h)(1 + cos h). So sin h = sqrt((1 - cos h)(1 + cos h)). Then sin h /h = sqrt( (1 - cos h)/h^2 * (1 + cos h) ). If we can show that (1 - cos h)/h^2 approaches 1/2, then sqrt( (1/2) * 2 ) = 1, but again, this requires knowing the limit of (1 - cos h)/h^2, which is typically derived using the limit of sin h /h. So again circular.\n\nHmm. It seems challenging to derive the limit without some sort of inequality that directly relates sin h and h. Apostol's fourth condition provides such an inequality, which allows sandwiching sin x /x between cos x and 1, both approaching 1. If we don't have that inequality, but assume continuity, maybe it's not enough. Because continuity tells us that cos x approaches 1, but doesn't give the rate at which it approaches. Similarly, sin x approaches 0, but we need to know the rate is linear in x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if we assume differentiability of sine at 0. If we assume that sine is differentiable at 0, then the derivative is lim_{h→0} sin h /h. If we can show that this derivative is 1, but we need to connect it to other properties. However, without the inequality, how would we find the value of the derivative?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the mean value theorem or some other theorem. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose we define the function S(x) = sin x and C(x) = cos x. We have the identities:\n\n1. C(0) = 1, S(π/2) = 1, C(π) = -1\n2. C(y - x) = C(y)C(x) + S(x)S(y)\n3. Continuity of C(x)\n\nFrom these, can we derive that S(x)/x →1 as x→0?\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find the value of S(x) for small x. Let's take x approaching 0. Suppose we set y = x in the identity C(y - x) = C(y)C(x) + S(x)S(y). Wait, if y = x, then C(0) = C(x)^2 + S(x)^2 → 1 = C(x)^2 + S(x)^2, which we already have.\n\nAlternatively, take y = 2x. Then C(2x - x) = C(2x)C(x) + S(x)S(2x). So C(x) = C(2x)C(x) + S(x)S(2x). Rearranging, C(x)(1 - C(2x)) = S(x)S(2x). But not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, set y = x/2. Then C(x/2 - x) = C(x/2)C(x) + S(x)S(x/2). So C(-x/2) = C(x/2)C(x) + S(x)S(x/2). Since C(-x/2) = C(x/2), we have C(x/2) = C(x/2)C(x) + S(x)S(x/2). Then, rearranged: C(x/2)(1 - C(x)) = S(x)S(x/2). Still not helpful.\n\nPerhaps use induction or some iterative approach. For example, express S(x) in terms of S(x/2). But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the continuity of C(x). We know C(0) =1, and C is continuous, so for small x, C(x) is close to 1. From the identity S(x)^2 =1 - C(x)^2, S(x) is close to 0. So S(x) is approximately sqrt(2(1 - C(x))) for small x, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we define the limit L = lim_{x→0} S(x)/x. If we can express this limit in terms of the derivative of C(x) at 0. For example, C'(0) = lim_{x→0} [C(x) - C(0)]/x = lim [C(x) -1]/x. From the Pythagorean identity, S(x) = sqrt(1 - C(x)^2). So S(x)/x = sqrt( (1 - C(x))(1 + C(x)) ) /x. If we assume that C(x) is differentiable at 0, then 1 - C(x) ≈ -C'(0)x, so S(x)/x ≈ sqrt( -C'(0)x * 2 ) /x = sqrt( -2 C'(0) x ) /x = sqrt( -2 C'(0) ) / sqrt(x). This would go to infinity unless C'(0) =0. But if C'(0)=0, then S(x)/x ≈ sqrt(0)/x =0, which contradicts S(x)/x →1. So this approach seems problematic unless there's an error in reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, if C'(0)=0, then lim_{x→0} [C(x)-1]/x =0, which implies that C(x) ≈1 + o(x). Then S(x) = sqrt(1 - C(x)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1 + o(x))^2) ≈ sqrt(-2 o(x) - o(x^2)), which becomes imaginary unless we have more precise information. So this suggests that differentiability of C(x) at 0 is not sufficient, and we need a quadratic approximation for C(x) near 0.\n\nBut to get that, we need to know that C''(0) exists. But again, this requires knowing the derivatives, which depend on the limit we're trying to find.\n\nIt seems like without an inequality that directly relates S(x)/x to something that can be squeezed, like in the original Apostol's approach, it's difficult to establish the limit. The fourth condition provides such a squeeze: cos(x) < sin(x)/x <1, and since cos(x) approaches 1 as x→0, the squeeze theorem gives the limit.\n\nIf we remove that inequality and replace it with continuity of cosine, we might not have enough information to bound sin(x)/x. Continuity tells us that cos(x) approaches 1, but not how quickly. For example, if cos(x) =1 -x^4 for small x, then sin(x)/x would be sqrt(1 - (1 -x^4)^2)/x = sqrt(2x^4 -x^8)/x ≈ sqrt(2)x^2/x = sqrt(2)x, which approaches 0. But this contradicts the known limit. So in this case, if we don't have the inequality, the limit could be 0, which is wrong. Therefore, the inequality is necessary to ensure that cos(x) approaches 1 at a rate that allows sin(x)/x to approach 1.\n\nTherefore, the fourth condition in Apostol's definition is necessary unless we can find another condition that provides a similar bound. The user suggests replacing it with \"cos(x) is continuous,\" but as shown above, continuity alone isn't sufficient. We need more information about the behavior of cos(x) near 0, specifically that it's bounded below by something approaching 1 linearly (or similar). The inequality 0 < cos(x) < sin(x)/x <1 provides exactly that.\n\nHence, the answer to the question is that yes, the fourth condition (the inequality) is necessary to derive the limit lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x =1. Continuity of cosine alone isn't sufficient, and you can't derive the limit from just the first three conditions plus continuity. The fourth condition provides the necessary squeeze to apply the squeeze theorem.",
