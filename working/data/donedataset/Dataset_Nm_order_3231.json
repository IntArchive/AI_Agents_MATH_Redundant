    "Content": "I want to show that the set of orthogonal matrices, $O(n) = \\{A \\in M_{n \\times n} | A^tA=Id\\}$, is an embedded submanifold of the set of all $n \\times n$ matrices $M_{n \\times n}$. So far, I have used that this set can be described as $O(n) = f^{-1}(Id)$, where $f: M_{n \\times n} \\rightarrow Sym_n = \\{A \\in M_{n \\times n} | A^t = A\\}$ is given by $f(A) = AA^t$, and that the map $f$ is smooth. Hence I still need to show that $Id$ is a regular point of this map, i.e. that the differential map $f_*$ (or $df$ if you wish) has maximal rank in all points of $O(n)$. How do I find this map? I tried taking a path $\\gamma = A + tX$ in $O(n)$ and finding the speed of $f \\circ \\gamma$ at $t=0$, which appears to be $XA^t + AX^t$, but don't see how to proceed. Another way I thought of was by expressing everything as vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$, but the expressions got too complicated and I lost track.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think you have almost done. As you said, it suffices to show that $\\mathrm{Id}$ is a regular value of $f$, i.e. for each $A\\in O(n)$, $f_*:T_A M_{n\\times n}\\to T_{\\mathrm{Id}}Sym_n$ is surjective, where $T_pX$ denotes the tangent space of $X$ at $p$. Note that $T_A M_{n\\times n}$(resp. $T_{\\mathrm{Id}}Sym_n$) can be identified with $M_{n\\times n}$(resp. $Sym_n$) and, as you have known, $f_*(X)=XA^t+AX^t$. Then you only need to verify that for any $S\\in Sym_n$, there exists $X\\in M_{n\\times n}$, such that $XA^t+AX^t=S$. At least you may choose  $X=\\dfrac{1}{2}SA$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that O(n), the orthogonal group, is an embedded submanifold of M_{n×n}, the space of all n×n matrices. They mentioned using the preimage f^{-1}(Id) where f(A) = AA^t, and they need to show that Id is a regular value. That means the differential df at any A in O(n) should be surjective.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the differential of a map between manifolds is. For matrix manifolds, often the differential can be computed by taking directional derivatives. The user tried taking a path γ(t) = A + tX in O(n) and found that the derivative of f∘γ at t=0 is XA^t + AX^t. But wait, if γ is a path in O(n), then γ(t) must satisfy γ(t)^t γ(t) = Id for all t. Differentiating this at t=0 gives X^t A + A^t X = 0, so X is in the tangent space at A, which is the set of matrices X such that A^t X is skew-symmetric. But the user's calculation gives the derivative of f along X as XA^t + AX^t. \n\nSo the differential df_A(X) = XA^t + AX^t. Now, to show that df_A is surjective onto the symmetric matrices Sym_n. Let’s see: For any symmetric matrix S, we need to find X such that XA^t + AX^t = S. Since A is orthogonal, A^t = A^{-1}. Let me substitute Y = XA^t, so the equation becomes Y + Y^t = S. Because Y + Y^t is symmetric, any symmetric S can be written as Y + Y^t by choosing Y = (1/2)S. Then Y = (1/2)S, so X = (1/2)SA. But wait, does this X satisfy the condition? Let me check: If X = (1/2)SA, then XA^t = (1/2)SA A^t = (1/2)S Id = (1/2)S. Then AX^t = A ( (1/2)SA )^t = (1/2) A A^t S^t = (1/2) Id S, since S is symmetric. So AX^t = (1/2) S. Adding XA^t + AX^t = (1/2)S + (1/2)S = S. So yes, that works. Therefore, for any S in Sym_n, there exists X = (1/2)SA such that df_A(X) = S. Hence, df_A is surjective. Therefore, Id is a regular value, so O(n) = f^{-1}(Id) is an embedded submanifold.\n\nWait, but the problem in the original question is to structure it into assumptions and problem. Let me check the example given. The user's example had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is about O(n) being an embedded submanifold. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. Let's parse the original question again.\n\nOriginal question says: Show that O(n) = {A in M_{n×n} | A^t A = Id} is an embedded submanifold of M_{n×n}. The user's approach is to define f: M_{n×n} → Sym_n by f(A) = AA^t, so O(n) = f^{-1}(Id). Then they need to show that Id is a regular value, i.e., df_A is surjective for all A in O(n). The problem is to show that Id is a regular value of f, which would imply O(n) is an embedded submanifold.\n\nSo structuring this into the required format: The assumptions would include the definitions and given conditions. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- O(n) is the set of orthogonal matrices {A ∈ M_{n×n} | A^T A = Id}.\n- M_{n×n} is the space of all n×n real matrices.\n- Sym_n is the space of symmetric n×n real matrices.\n- f: M_{n×n} → Sym_n is defined by f(A) = A A^T.\n- f is a smooth map.\n- O(n) = f^{-1}(Id).\n\nProblem:\nShow that Id is a regular value of f, i.e., the differential df_A is surjective for every A ∈ O(n).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more about the setup. So each assumption should list the properties. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem says: Show that O(n) is an embedded submanifold of M_{n×n}. The approach is using f(A) = AA^T, so O(n) = f^{-1}(Id). They have already shown f is smooth. The remaining part is to show that Id is a regular value. So the assumptions are:\n\n- f is smooth.\n- O(n) is the preimage of Id under f.\n- The target space of f is Sym_n.\n\nBut the user's question is to structure the problem as per the format. The original problem as presented by the user includes that they have already defined f and shown it's smooth. So the assumptions to list would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- O(n) is the set {A ∈ M_{n×n} | A^T A = Id}.\n- f: M_{n×n} → Sym_n is defined by f(A) = A A^T.\n- f is smooth.\n- O(n) = f^{-1}(Id).\n\nProblem:\nShow that Id is a regular value of f, i.e., for every A ∈ O(n), the differential df_A: T_A M_{n×n} → T_{f(A)} Sym_n is surjective.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more precisely to compute the differential df_A and show it's surjective. The user tried taking a path and computed the derivative. So the structured problem should capture that. The key assumption is that f is smooth and O(n) is the preimage of Id. The problem is to show that the differential at each A in O(n) is surjective.",
