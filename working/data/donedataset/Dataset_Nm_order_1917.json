    "Content": "Update on 5/27/2020: I summarized all discussions related to this post, added a bit more about computational complexity, and published it on my blog, here . I've been working on this problem for a long time, read great books on the topic, and came up with the following. I am wondering if my approach could result in a very fast algorithm for factoring big numbers. 1. Algorithm As an illustration of how it works, let's apply it to factoring a very modest number, $z=x\\cdot y = 1223 \\times 2731$ . It involves the following steps. Step 1 . Compute $z_p = z \\mbox{ Mod } p$ , for $p=2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,\\cdots, p_z$ . In this case, the upper bound can be as low as $p_z = 127$ (see section 2 about the choice of $p_z$ ). Check values of $p$ generating many identical $z_p$ values. Here, $z_p = 5$ or $z_p = 23$ for instance. Step 2 . We have $z_{59} = z_{85} = z_{111} = 23$ . Thus if $b = 59 \\times 85 \\times 111$ , because of Theorem A listed below, we have $z_b=23$ . Not sure if this is of any help. Step 3 . Find the set of $(x, y)$ with $x<y$ , with $x, y$ odd, and $x\\cdot y \\leq z$ satisfying all of the following: $x\\cdot y = 23 \\mbox{ Mod } 59$ $x\\cdot y = 23 \\mbox{ Mod } 85$ $x\\cdot y = 23 \\mbox{ Mod } 111$ You need to create 3 multiplication tables to identify the full list (intersection of 3 infinite lists) of candidates, and ignore those $(x, y)$ that result in $x\\cdot y> z$ or $x$ even or $y$ even. Step 4 . The result is $(x, y) \\in \\{(61,36503),(173,12871),(211,10553),(829, 1327),(1223,2731) \\}$ . Step 5 . Among all the 5 above candidates, check if one yields $x\\cdot y = z$ . Here $(x=1223, y=2731)$ does and we've factored $z$ . The big question is: how difficult it is to perform step 3? The following elementary theorem could be useful. Could you find a reference for this theorem, or at least prove it? I discovered it myself, but I am sure it must be at least 300 years old. Theorem A Let $p_1, \\cdots, p_k$ be $k$ pairwise co-prime positive integers, and $a>0$ an integer. If $z= a \\mbox{ Mod } p_i$ for $i=1,\\cdots,k$ , then $z= a \\mbox{ Mod } (p_1\\cdots p_k)$ . Also, let $$q = \\arg \\max_{p<z} \\{z= a \\mbox{ Mod } p\\}.$$ Then $q+a = z$ . 2. Choice of $p_z$ In practice, in step 1, you can choose the smallest $p_z$ such that $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5\\cdot 7 \\cdots \\cdot p_z > M z$ where $M$ is an absolute constant, maybe as low as $M=30$ . Then you have more than enough choices for step 3. In our example in section 1, we have $z= 3,340,013$ while $59\\times 85 \\times 111 = 556,665$ . It results in only 5 candidates in step 4. If instead, we consider $x\\cdot y = 5 \\mbox{ Mod } 21$ $x\\cdot y = 5 \\mbox{ Mod } 47$ $x\\cdot y = 23 \\mbox{ Mod } 59$ $x\\cdot y = 23 \\mbox{ Mod } 85$ $x\\cdot y = 23 \\mbox{ Mod } 111$ then there would be only 1 candidate in step 4, resulting in factoring $z$ . Note that the product $21 \\times 47 \\times 59\\times 85 \\times 111 =549,428,355$ is big enough (much bigger than $z$ itself) and this is what causes the candidate in step 4 to be unique, thus removing the need for step 5. Another example also producing a single candidate (the correct one) is $x\\cdot y = 2 \\mbox{ Mod } 3$ $x\\cdot y = 3 \\mbox{ Mod } 5$ $x\\cdot y = 5 \\mbox{ Mod } 7$ $x\\cdot y = 6 \\mbox{ Mod } 11$ $x\\cdot y = 1 \\mbox{ Mod } 13$ $x\\cdot y = 6 \\mbox{ Mod } 17$ $x\\cdot y = 3 \\mbox{ Mod } 19$ Again only one candidate in step 4 (thus no step 5) because $3\\times 5 \\times 7 \\cdots \\times 19 =  4,849,845$ is big enough, bigger than $z$ . 3. Working with non-primes and conjecture Weirdly enough, this choice works too, resulting in 4 candidates in step 4, including the correct one: $x\\cdot y = 1242861 \\mbox{ Mod } 2^{21}$ The result is $(x, y) \\in \\{(3,414287),(97,12813),(291,4271),(1223,2731) \\}$ . Remember, $z = 1223 \\times 2731$ . This leads to the following conjecture. Conjecture If $z$ is not a prime number, then the following system, with $x \\cdot y \\leq z$ , uniquely determines two non-trivial numbers $x, y$ such that $x\\cdot y = z$ . The system is as follows: $$x\\cdot y = m_i \\mbox{ Mod } p_i, \\mbox{ with } i=1,\\cdots, k$$ where $p_1,p_2$ and so on are the prime numbers, $m_i = z \\mbox{ Mod } p_i$ , and $k$ is the smallest integer such that $p_1\\times \\cdots\\times p_k > C z$ where $C$ is an absolute constant. I don't know what would be the lower bound for $C$ , maybe $C=10$ works. The congruence system is linked to the Chinese Remainder Theorem. See page 88 in the book Prime Numbers - A Computational Perspective (2nd Edition), by R Grandall and C Pomerance (Springer, 2010). A careful choice of the moduli (rather than $p_1, \\cdots, p_k$ ) could lead to a faster algorithm.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is describing an algorithm for factoring large numbers and wants to know if their approach, specifically step 3, is feasible. They also mention a theorem they call Theorem A and ask for a reference or proof. The example given factors z = 1223 × 2731 by using congruences modulo several numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the main problem. The assumptions should list all the conditions and properties applied to each object. The problem is to determine the difficulty of step 3 and to prove or reference Theorem A.\n\nLooking at the Theorem A: It states that if p1,...,pk are pairwise coprime and z ≡ a mod pi for each i, then z ≡ a mod (p1...pk). Also, if q is the largest p less than z such that z ≡ a mod p, then q + a = z. The theorem seems related to the Chinese Remainder Theorem but with an additional part about the maximum modulus.\n\nThe problem also mentions the conjecture about uniquely determining x and y through the system of congruences with moduli being primes and the product of moduli exceeding Cz. The user references a book, so maybe Theorem A is a variation of CRT, but the second part about q + a = z needs verification.\n\nAssumptions need to be broken down into individual points. For Theorem A, the assumptions would be that p_i are pairwise coprime, a is a positive integer, and z ≡ a mod each p_i. Then the conclusions are z ≡ a mod product of p_i, and q + a = z where q is the largest p < z with z ≡ a mod p.\n\nThe problem is twofold: first, to assess the difficulty of step 3 in the algorithm (which involves solving multiple congruences to find x and y) and second, to prove or find a reference for Theorem A.\n\nI need to structure this according to the given format. The assumptions for Theorem A would be the pairwise coprimality of the moduli, and z ≡ a mod each p_i. The problem part would be asking to prove Theorem A and to analyze the computational difficulty of step 3.",
