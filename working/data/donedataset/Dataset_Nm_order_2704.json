I don't know how generally this is true, but: assume $K=L$ . In that case, if $char(K) \\neq 2$ then there is a usual proof that $n=m$ by looking at the group of involutions of each, that yields $2^m = 2^n$ and this the result. if $char(K) = 2$ , I do not find any proof of this fact. is there a stronger result without supposing $K = L$ ? Can we at least conclude that $char(K) = char(L)$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think I have an answer for the case of $\\mathrm{char}(K) = 2$ (when $K = L$ ). First, for the case $\\mathrm{char}(K) \\neq 2$ , I don't understand what you mean about the group of involutions in $GL_{n}(K)$ . My interpretation is that if you look at the involutions of $GL_{n}(K)$ (i.e. the elements with $x^2 = 1$ ), they fall into one of exactly $n+1$ conjugacy classes: when $\\mathrm{char}(K) \\neq 2$ , a matrix with $x^2 = 1$ is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$ , hence the conjugacy class only depends on the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $-1$ , which can be $0, 1, 2, \\dots, n$ . Thus we can distinguish the groups $GL_n(K)$ by looking at the number of conjugacy classes of involutions. Let's try the same thing when $\\mathrm{char}(K) = 2$ . How many conjugacy classes of involutions are there in this case? We can write the condition $x^2 = 1$ as $(x - 1)^2 = 0$ . A matrix satisfying this equation can be written in Jordan canonical form as a block matrix with Jordan blocks $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\,\\,\\text{and}\\,\\, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$ and the conjugacy class is determined by the numbers of each type of Jordan block, so the number of conjugacy classes is just the number of partitions of the number $n$ into parts of size $1$ or $2$ , which is $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + 1$ . This almost works, but it fails to distinguish the case $n = 2k$ from $n = 2k+1$ . Instead, consider the number of conjugacy classes of elements which satisfy $x^4 = 1$ . In characteristic $2$ this condition can be written as $(x - 1)^4 = 0$ , so a matrix satisfying this equation can be written in Jordan canonical form as a block matrix with Jordan blocks $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$ where again the conjugacy class is determined by the numbers of each type of Jordan block. It follows that the number of conjugacy classes is the number $p_4(n)$ of partitions of the number $n$ into parts of size $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , and $4$ . With some work, we can explicitly calculate this number as a function of $n$ , but it suffices to show that it's strictly increasing in $n$ . Note that for $n \\geq 1$ we have an injection from the partitions of $n$ of this form to the partitions of $n+1$ of this form given by adding an additional part of size $1$ . But we can represent all numbers $m \\geq 2$ as a sum $2a + 3b$ for $a, b \\geq 0$ , so in particular, there is a partition of $n+1$ into only parts of size $2$ and $3$ -- which is necessarily not in the image of our injection. It follows that $p_4(n+1) \\geq p_4(n) + 1$ , so $p_4$ is strictly increasing. Then for $n \\neq m$ , $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(K)$ have distinct numbers of conjugacy classes of elements with $x^4 = 1$ , since $p_4(n) \\neq p_4(m)$ , so they are not isomorphic.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided includes breaking down assumptions and stating the problem clearly. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is \"When are $GL_n$ and $GL_m$ equivalent... in characteristic 2?\" The question discusses proving that $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups if and only if $m=n$ and $K \\simeq L$. The user mentions that when the characteristic isn't 2, there's a proof using involutions, but in characteristic 2, they can't find a proof. They also ask if there's a stronger result without assuming $K = L$ and whether the characteristics must be equal.\n\nNow, the task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the main problem. The example given by the user lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition on one object.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the key points are:\n\n1. The fields $K$ and $L$ are being considered.\n2. The question is about the isomorphism of $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ as groups.\n3. The characteristic of the fields is involved: specifically, when $char(K) = 2$ and whether the conclusion holds in that case.\n4. The problem also asks if we can conclude $char(K) = char(L)$ without assuming $K = L$.\n\nWait, the original problem has two parts: one when $K = L$ and characteristic 2, and another when $K$ and $L$ might be different. The user is asking if the result can be strengthened without assuming $K = L$, and whether characteristics must match.\n\nBut the user's example structure for the problem seems to focus on specific assumptions. So, in the current problem, the assumptions would include that we're dealing with general linear groups over fields, maybe the characteristic of the field being 2, and possibly that $K$ and $L$ are fields.\n\nWait, the user's example for the divisibility problem had two assumptions: $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, the user starts by stating they want to prove that $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic iff $m=n$ and $K \\simeq L$. Then they discuss the case when $K = L$ and characteristic not 2, but in characteristic 2, they have no proof. Then they ask two questions: can we have a stronger result without assuming $K = L$, and can we at least conclude the characteristics are equal.\n\nBut the user wants the problem structured into assumptions and the problem. So perhaps the main problem here is whether $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ being isomorphic as groups implies $m=n$ and $K \\simeq L$, especially in characteristic 2, and whether characteristics must be equal without assuming $K = L$.\n\nBut the original question is a bit multi-part. The user is asking two things: first, in the case when $K = L$ and characteristic 2, does the result hold (i.e., does $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(K)$ imply $n = m$?), and second, without assuming $K = L$, can we conclude $char(K) = char(L)$?\n\nThe example given in the user's instruction has the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions. So here, perhaps the problem is to determine under what conditions $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic, focusing on characteristic 2, and the other parts are sub-questions.\n\nBut the user's example includes assumptions as separate points. Let me parse the original question again:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n\"When are $GL_n$ and $GL_m$ equivalent... in characteristic 2?\n\nFor fields $K$ and $L$, I am interested in proving that \"$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic (as groups) if and only if $m=n$ and $K\\simeq L$\". I don't know how generally this is true, but: assume $K=L$. In that case, if $char(K) \\neq 2$ then there is a usual proof that $n=m$ by looking at the group of involutions of each, that yields $2^m = 2^n$ and this the result. if $char(K) = 2$, I do not find any proof of this fact. is there a stronger result without supposing $K = L$? Can we at least conclude that $char(K) = char(L)$?\"\n\nSo the user's main problem is to prove the equivalence $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(L) \\iff m = n$ and $K \\simeq L$, but they are specifically stuck on the case when $char(K) = 2$ and $K = L$. Additionally, they ask two things: whether there's a stronger result without assuming $K = L$, and whether we can conclude the characteristics are equal.\n\nBut the user wants the problem structured into assumptions and the problem. So the problem here would be, perhaps, the original statement: Prove that $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups if and only if $m = n$ and $K \\simeq L$, especially when $char(K) = 2$, and whether characteristics must match. But the example shows that the problem is written concisely, and the assumptions are specific.\n\nWait, in the user's example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem being to prove divisibility by 91. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. \n\nIn the current problem, the user mentions that when $K = L$ and characteristic ≠ 2, the proof works, but when characteristic is 2, it's unclear. So perhaps the problem here is: Under the assumption that $K$ is a field of characteristic 2, prove that if $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(K)$ are isomorphic as groups, then $n = m$. But the user is also asking if we can avoid assuming $K = L$ and still get that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nBut the user's problem statement is multi-part. However, the user's format example has only one problem statement. So perhaps the main problem is the original assertion, and the assumptions include that $K = L$ and $char(K) = 2$, but the problem also includes the other questions. Wait, but the example has only one problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is split into two parts: one about the case when $K = L$ and characteristic 2, and another about when $K$ and $L$ are different but we can conclude characteristics are equal. But the user's example includes only one problem. So maybe the user wants each part structured as a separate problem? But according to the example, it's one problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are that $K$ and $L$ are fields, $K = L$, and $char(K) = 2$, leading to the problem of proving $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(K) \\implies n = m$. Then, another problem could be whether $char(K) = char(L)$ without assuming $K = L$, but the user's example only structures one problem at a time. However, the original question has multiple parts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the problem structured into two separate formatted problems. But given that the user's example is a single problem, perhaps the answer should structure each part as a separate problem. Wait, but the user didn't specify that. The instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", so maybe each part (the main problem and the additional questions) should be separate. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to address the original assertion (iff statement) when $char(K) = 2$, and the assumptions are $K = L$ and $char(K) = 2$, leading to the problem being to prove that $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(K)$ implies $n = m$. Then, the other part about whether characteristics must be equal even when $K \\neq L$ is another problem. But perhaps the user wants to capture both in the formatted problem.\n\nBut the user's example only had one problem and a few assumptions. Let me re-examine the original problem's key points:\n\nThe user wants to prove that $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(L) \\iff m =n$ and $K \\simeq L$. In the case when $K = L$, if the characteristic is not 2, they can prove $n = m$, but when characteristic is 2, they can't. So the problem here is whether the original assertion holds in characteristic 2. Then, they ask if there's a stronger result without $K = L$, and if we can at least conclude the characteristics are equal.\n\nSo perhaps the formatted problem should capture the main problem (the equivalence) under the assumption that $char(K) = 2$ and $K = L$, and then another problem about characteristics when $K \\neq L$. But according to the user's example, each problem is structured with its own assumptions and problem statement. Therefore, maybe there are two separate problems here:\n\nFirst problem:\nAssumptions:\n$K$ and $L$ are fields,\n$K = L$,\n$char(K) = 2$.\nProblem: Prove that $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(K)$ are isomorphic as groups if and only if $n = m$.\n\nSecond problem:\nAssumptions:\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem: Can we conclude that $char(K) = char(L)$?\n\nBut the user's example only structures one problem. However, the original question has two parts. Perhaps the answer should list both problems separately. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem in the original post is structured accordingly. But the original post is one question with multiple parts. So maybe the user wants all assumptions listed and the problem as the main question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $m = n$ and $K \\simeq L$, or at least $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nBut the original problem is about the equivalence. Wait, the original user is trying to prove the if and only if statement. So the problem would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups if and only if $m = n$ and $K \\simeq L$, particularly when $char(K) = 2$.\n\nBut the assumptions here would be that $K$ and $L$ are fields, and possibly that $char(K) = 2$ if we are focusing on that case. However, the example given by the user includes assumptions that are more specific. For instance, in the example, they listed that $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7. So for this problem, the assumptions might be:\n\n- $K$ and $L$ are fields\n- $char(K) = 2$\n- $K = L$\n\nBut the original question first assumes $K = L$ and then asks about the case without $K = L$. Therefore, maybe there are two separate problems here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main problem is when $K = L$ and characteristic 2, and the other part is about characteristics.\n\nBut since the user's format example has one problem with multiple assumptions, I'll need to structure each part accordingly.\n\nLooking back at the original question: The user starts by wanting to prove the equivalence for general $K$ and $L$, then focuses on the case when $K = L$ and characteristic 2. They also ask two questions: can we strengthen the result without assuming $K = L$, and can we conclude characteristics are equal.\n\nBut perhaps the formatted problem should capture the main problem the user is stuck on, which is the case when $K = L$ and characteristic 2. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ is a field,\n$char(K) = 2$,\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(K)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $n = m$.\n\nThen, another problem when $K$ and $L$ are different fields:\n\nAssumption:\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nBut according to the example, each problem is separate. However, the user may expect both to be addressed. But perhaps the user's original problem is a single question with multiple parts, so we need to structure it as such. However, the example given by the user has a single problem with multiple assumptions. Therefore, maybe the best approach is to list all relevant assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is interested in proving the equivalence (iff) statement. However, they note that in the case when $K = L$ and characteristic ≠2, there's a proof, but not when characteristic is 2. So the main problem here is to prove the equivalence when $K = L$ and characteristic 2. Additionally, they ask whether, without assuming $K = L$, can we at least conclude the characteristics are equal.\n\nBut how to structure this into the given format? The format requires listing assumptions line by line and then the problem.\n\nFor the first part:\n\nAssumption:\n$K = L$,\n$char(K) = 2$,\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(K)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $n = m$.\n\nFor the second part:\n\nAssumption:\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nBut the user's example lists assumptions related to the problem's conditions, not the problem's given. Wait, in the example, the assumption is that $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem statement is to prove the equivalence (iff) for general $K$ and $L$. Then, the user discusses the case when $K = L$ and characteristic 2. So perhaps the formatted problem for that specific case is:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ is a field of characteristic 2,\n$K = L$,\nProblem:\nProve that $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups if and only if $n = m$ and $K \\simeq L$.\n\nBut since $K = L$, $K \\simeq L$ is trivial, so the problem simplifies to proving $n = m$. Hence, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n$K = L$,\n$char(K) = 2$,\nProblem:\nProve that $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(K)$ implies $n = m$.\n\nThen, the other part:\n\nAssumption:\n$GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(L)$ as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentions \"is there a stronger result without supposing $K = L$?\" So maybe the first problem is the equivalence when $K = L$ and characteristic 2, and the second is the characteristic part.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is seeking help on two aspects, perhaps the answer should structure two separate problems.\n\nBut given the user's example, I think the main problem here is the case when $K = L$ and characteristic 2, so:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ is a field,\n$K = L$,\n$char(K) = 2$.\nProblem:\nProve that if $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(K)$ are isomorphic as groups, then $n = m$.\n\nAnd the other problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is asking for the iff statement. So perhaps the first problem should be the forward direction: if they are isomorphic, then $n = m$ and $K \\simeq L$, in the case of $K = L$ and characteristic 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is stated as:\n\nProblem: Prove that for fields $K$ and $L$ of characteristic 2, $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(L)$ as groups if and only if $n = m$ and $K \\simeq L$.\n\nBut the user is unsure if this holds in characteristic 2. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ and $L$ are fields,\n$char(K) = 2$,\n$char(L) = 2$.\nProblem:\nProve that $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(L)$ as groups if and only if $n = m$ and $K \\simeq L$.\n\nBut the user's problem is whether this holds in characteristic 2. Alternatively, maybe the user is focusing on the case where $K = L$ and characteristic 2. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ is a field,\n$char(K) = 2$,\nProblem:\nProve that $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(K)$ as groups if and only if $n = m$.\n\nAlternatively, since the \"if and only if\" would require that when $n = m$, they are isomorphic, but that's trivial, so the non-trivial part is the converse: isomorphic implies $n = m$. So perhaps the problem is to prove that when $K$ is a field of characteristic 2, $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(K)$ implies $n = m$.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ is a field,\n$char(K) = 2$,\nProblem:\nProve that if $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(K)$ are isomorphic as groups, then $n = m$.\n\nThen, the second part is:\n\nAssumption:\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each problem is structured individually. Therefore, I think the user would want each part structured separately. However, since the original question is a single post, perhaps we need to capture both in the formatted problem.\n\nBut given the example's structure, I think each problem should be separate. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying that the entire original question is to be formatted into one entry. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ and $L$ are fields,\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups,\n$char(K) = 2$,\n$K = L$.\nProblem:\nProve that $n = m$ and $K \\simeq L$.\n\nBut this seems conflating multiple points. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is being asked. The user is interested in two cases: when $K = L$ and char 2, and when $K$ and $L$ are different but we can conclude characteristics are equal.\n\nBut how to capture that in the format? The user's example had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So in this case, perhaps:\n\nFor the first part:\n\nAssumption:\n$K = L$,\n$char(K) = 2$.\nProblem:\nProve that $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(K)$ implies $n = m$.\n\nFor the second part:\n\nAssumption:\n$GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(L)$.\nProblem:\nProve that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nSo perhaps the formatted problem would need to include both. But since the user's example only includes one problem per format, maybe each part is a separate formatted problem. However, the original question is a single post. Given that, perhaps the answer should be two formatted problems.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying one structured entry per original problem. The original question has multiple parts but is a single problem. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions include all relevant conditions and the problem is the combined one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main problem is the original assertion, with assumptions that $K$ and $L$ are fields and maybe their characteristics. But the example includes specific assumptions that are conditions on the problem.\n\nAlternatively, given the user's example, the assumption is that n is an integer and divisible by 7, leading to the problem to prove divisibility by 91. So in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- $K$ and $L$ are fields,\n- $char(K) = 2$,\n- $K = L$,\n\nProblem: Prove that $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(K)$ implies $n = m$.\n\nAnd then another formatted problem for the characteristic part:\n\nAssumption: $GL_n(K) \\cong GL_m(L)$ as groups.\nProblem: Prove that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nBut since the original question is one post, perhaps both parts need to be captured. However, the user's format example is for one problem. So perhaps the answer should have two separate formatted entries.\n\nBut given the user's instruction, maybe the assistant should process the original question into two formatted problems. However, the user's example processes one problem. Therefore, I think the answer should present two formatted problems based on the original question's two parts.\n\nSo, first formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n$K = L$,\n$char(K) = 2$.\nProblem:\nProve that $GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(K)$ are isomorphic as groups if and only if $n = m$.\n\nSecond formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nBut let me check the original problem again. The user wrote: \"Can we at least conclude that $char(K) = char(L)$?\" So the second problem is whether isomorphism of the general linear groups implies the characteristics are equal. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$GL_n(K)$ and $GL_m(L)$ are isomorphic as groups.\nProblem:\nProve that $char(K) = char(L)$.\n\nYes, that makes sense. And the first problem is when $K = L$ and characteristic 2, whether isomorphism implies $n = m$. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be two formatted problems as above.",
