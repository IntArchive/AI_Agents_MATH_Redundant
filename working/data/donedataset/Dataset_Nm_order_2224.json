    "Content": "My teacher said to use Bertrand's postulate and I have tried this for so long and I seem to go nowhere. Help would be appreciated. EDIT: Here's what I've done in my proof so far (I need help finalizing case 2) First note that for $p_0=13$, we can express all integers $7 \\leq n \\leq 2p_0=26$ as a sum of distinct primes less than or equal to $13$. \nNow, we will prove that we can construct these sums indefinitely. Assume we know some prime $p'$ exists such that every integer $7\\leq n \\leq 2p'$ can be expressed as a sum of distinct primes less than or equal to $p'$. Then, by Bertrand's postulate, there exists a prime $p$ such that $p'<p<2p'$. We claim now that every integer $7\\leq n \\leq 2p$ can be written as a sum of distinct primes less than or equal to $p$. Consider the two following cases Case 1: $2p'-p\\geq 7$, hence $2p'\\geq p+7$ so the terms $p,p+1,\\dots,p+7$ are less than or equal to $2p'$ which means they can be written as a sum of distinct primes $\\leq p'$ by hypothesis. It is left to check whether the terms $p+8,p+9,\\dots, 2p$ satisfy our claim. Note if we subtract $p$ from every term in the arithmetic progression above, it becomes $8,9,\\dots, p<2p'$ which shows that each term can be written as the sum of $p$ plus some other distinct primes less than or equal to $p'<p$ by hypothesis. Case 2: $2p'-p\\leq 6$, hence $2p'\\leq p+6$. Here we can see all terms $p+7,\\dots, 2p$ satisfy our claim along with $p+2,p+3$ and $p+5$ by a similar argument as in Case 1. I'm not sure how to deal with $p+1,p+4,$ and $p+6$ though. EDIT: Oh, since any prime $p \\geq 13$ is odd, then the only possible values for $2p'$ in Case 2 are $p+1,p+3$ and $p+5$, so I don't have to worry about the other cases. I think I'm done! EDIT: Nope, I still need to deal with $p+4$ and $p+6$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We shall inductively prove a stronger form, namely that every positive integer $n \\ge 7$ can be written as the sum of distinct primes such that the largest is at most $\\max(11,n-7)$ . It turns out that strengthening makes the induction work! Take $n \\ge 28$ . Let $m = \\lceil \\frac{n-6}{2} \\rceil= \\lfloor\\frac{n-5}{2} \\rfloor$ . Let $p$ be a prime such that $m+1 \\le p \\le 2m-1$ [by Bertrand's postulate]. Then $\\frac{n-5}{2} \\le p \\le n-7$ . By the induction to be established $n-p$ can be written as a sum of distinct primes such that the largest is at most $\\max(11,n-p-7)$ , which is less than $p$ because $p \\ge \\frac{28-5}{2} > 11$ and $2p \\ge n-5 > n-7$ . Thus $n$ can be written as a sum of distinct primes such that the largest is at most $\\max(11,n-7)$ , and the induction holds as long as the claim is true for every $n$ from $7$ to $27$ . 7 = 5+2\n8 = 5+3\n9 = 7+2\n10 = 5+3+2\n11 = 11\n12 = 7+5\n13 = 11+2\n14 = 7+5+2\n15 = 7+5+3\n16 = 11+5\n17 = 7+5+3+2\n18 = 11+7\n19 = 11+5+3\n20 = 11+7+2\n21 = 11+7+3\n22 = 13+7+2\n23 = 13+7+3\n24 = 13+11\n25 = 13+7+5\n26 = 13+11+2\n27 = 13+11+3",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is trying to prove that every integer n ≥ 7 can be expressed as a sum of distinct primes. They mentioned using Bertrand's postulate and have outlined a proof attempt with some gaps, especially in Case 2. The original problem is about proving that for every integer n ≥7, it's possible to write n as a sum of distinct primes. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states \"every integer n ≥7\", so the main assumption is that n is an integer greater than or equal to 7. The user also references Bertrand's postulate, which states that for any integer p' ≥1, there exists a prime p such that p' < p < 2p'. However, the user's approach involves splitting into cases based on the relationship between p and p', where p is a prime found via Bertrand's postulate. \n\nIn their proof attempt, they start with p₀=13 and check up to 2p₀=26, then use induction with Bertrand's postulate to extend this. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n- The base case holds (n from 7 to 26 can be expressed as sums of distinct primes ≤13).\n- Bertrand's postulate applies to find a prime p between p' and 2p'.\n- The induction step assumes that if up to 2p' is possible, then with the new prime p, up to 2p can be covered.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, the assumptions should only include the given conditions of the problem, not the proof steps. The original problem doesn't mention Bertrand's postulate as a condition; that's part of the solution. So the only assumption is that n is an integer greater than or equal to 7.\n\nWait, but the user's edits mention primes ≥13, but the original problem statement just says n≥7. So the problem's assumption is n is an integer, n ≥7. The rest are steps in their attempted proof. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions as per the problem statement, not the user's approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every integer n ≥ 7 can be expressed as a sum of distinct primes.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" which was part of the original problem's hidden assumption. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem had \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem has an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, let me check again:\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems wrong because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That contradicts. Maybe the example was a mistake. Or perhaps the user in the example added an extra assumption erroneously. \n\nBut in our current problem, the user's problem is to prove that every integer n ≥7 can be expressed as a sum of distinct primes. The problem's assumptions are just that n is an integer ≥7. The user's attempt uses Bertrand's postulate and induction, but those are part of the proof method, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every integer n ≥ 7 can be expressed as a sum of distinct primes.\n\nBut let me check again. The original problem says \"every integer n ≥7\", so those are the assumptions. The user's edits mention primes like p₀=13 and so on, but those are part of their proof attempt, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the two assumptions: n is integer, n ≥7.",
