    "AcceptedAnswer": "The general notion of a \"bimorphism\" and the classifying tensor product has been studied in the paper B. Banaschewski and E. Nelson. Tensor products and bimorphisms.\n  Canad. Math. Bull, 19(4):385-402, 1976. It contains a general theorem which shows that tensor products \"almost always\" exist. In the case of topological spaces, the construction looks as follows: First, consider the coproduct $P=\\coprod_{x \\in X} Y \\sqcup \\coprod_{y \\in Y} X$. For each $x \\in X$ we have an inclusion $i_x : Y \\to P$. For each $y \\in Y$ we have an inclusion $j_y : X \\to P$. Define $X \\otimes Y$ to be the quotient space $P/{\\sim}$ where $i_x(y) \\sim j_y(x)$. This obviously satisfies the required universal property. Notice that the underlying set of $X \\otimes Y$ is just $\\{(x,y) : x \\in X, y \\in Y\\}$, and the topology looks as follows: A subset $U$ is open iff for every $x \\in X$ the set $\\{y \\in Y : (x,y) \\in U\\}$ is open in $Y$ and for every $y \\in Y$ the set $\\{x \\in X : (x,y) \\in U\\}$ is open in $X$. If we apply this type of construction to the category of modules, we also obtain an alternative construction of the tensor product of modules ( SE/291644 ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Tensor products in general topology?\" which suggests the user is asking about the existence of a tensor product-like construction for topological spaces. The question itself mentions two topological spaces (X, τ) and (Y, σ), and their product space with the box topology. The user then states that they believe there is no space X⊗Y with a bicontinuous map μ (separately continuous) such that any bicontinuous map f factors uniquely through a continuous map φ. They want to know how to prove that such an X⊗Y doesn't generally exist.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The assumptions are the given conditions or properties that the problem states. Let me list them one by one:\n\n1. (X, τ) and (Y, σ) are topological spaces.\n2. The product space (X×Y, τ×σ) is equipped with the box topology.\n3. There is a bicontinuous (separately continuous) map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n4. For any bicontinuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a unique continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z making the diagram commute.\n\nThe problem is to prove that such a space X⊗Y does not exist in general.\n\nWait, the user mentions that \"since I never heard of it I guess that there is no space X⊗Y...\" so the problem is to show that such a tensor product space doesn't always exist. The assumptions would include the conditions required for such a tensor product, and the problem is to demonstrate that these conditions can't be satisfied in general.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let me check again:\n\nAssumption 1: (X, τ) and (Y, σ) are topological spaces. Hmm, but each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So maybe split them:\n\n1. X is a topological space with topology τ.\n2. Y is a topological space with topology σ.\n3. The product space X×Y is equipped with the box topology τ×σ.\n4. There exists a topological space X⊗Y and a separately continuous map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n5. For every topological space Z and every separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a unique continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n\nWait, the problem is stating that such a space X⊗Y does not exist in general. So the assumptions are the conditions that would define such a tensor product, and the problem is to prove that these cannot be satisfied for all X and Y.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the existence of such a space X⊗Y with the universal property that any separately continuous map factors through μ. The problem is to prove that this cannot exist in general.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list all the conditions that such a tensor product would have to satisfy. Let me try to structure them step by step:\n\nAssumption 1: X is a topological space with topology τ.\n\nAssumption 2: Y is a topological space with topology σ.\n\nAssumption 3: The product space X×Y is equipped with the box topology τ×σ.\n\nWait, but the box topology here is part of the problem's setup, but the question is about the existence of X⊗Y. Maybe the box topology isn't directly an assumption for the tensor product's existence. Let me re-express.\n\nThe original problem says that since the user hasn't heard of such a tensor product, they assume it doesn't exist and want to prove it. The setup includes the product with box topology, but the tensor product X⊗Y is supposed to have a bicontinuous map μ (separately continuous) such that any bicontinuous f factors through φ. So the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\n- The existence of a space X⊗Y with a separately continuous map μ from X×Y.\n- The universal property that any separately continuous f factors uniquely through a continuous φ.\n\nBut maybe to structure the assumptions correctly, each as a single property:\n\n1. X and Y are topological spaces.\n2. There exists a topological space X⊗Y.\n3. There exists a separately continuous map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n4. For every topological space Z and separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a unique continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n\nBut the user is saying that such a space X⊗Y does not exist in general. So the problem is to prove that under these assumptions (i.e., the conditions 2-4), such an X⊗Y does not exist in general. Therefore, the problem is to show that there exist topological spaces X and Y for which no such X⊗Y exists satisfying those properties.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions (the conditions that such a tensor product would require) and the problem is to prove that such an X⊗Y doesn't exist in general.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the assumptions are the general conditions for the existence of the tensor product. Therefore, the problem is to prove that such a space X⊗Y (with the universal property) does not exist in general.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is a topological space.\n- Y is a topological space.\n- There exists a topological space X⊗Y.\n- There exists a separately continuous map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n- For every topological space Z and every separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a unique continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a space X⊗Y does not exist in general.\n\nWait, but the original problem mentions the box topology on X×Y. Should that be included as an assumption? The user starts by talking about the box topology on X×Y, but the question is about the existence of X⊗Y. The box topology might not be directly relevant to the assumptions for the tensor product. The box topology is part of the product space, but the tensor product would be a different space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the box topology is mentioned as a context, but the key assumptions are about the universal property. The user is hypothesizing that because they haven't heard of such a tensor product, it doesn't exist. So the problem is to show that there's no such X⊗Y with the universal property for separately continuous maps.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should focus on the universal property. Let me try to rephrase:\n\nAssumption:\n- X and Y are topological spaces.\n- There exists a topological space X⊗Y and a map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n- The map μ is separately continuous.\n- For every topological space Z and every separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a unique continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a space X⊗Y does not exist in general.\n\nBut the original problem says \"How to prove that such a X⊗Y in general not exists?\" So the problem is exactly that: to prove that such a tensor product space doesn't generally exist.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the conditions required for the tensor product (the universal property), and the problem is to prove that such a space can't exist in general.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have the assumptions as the conditions for the existence of X⊗Y with the universal property, and the problem is to prove that such a space doesn't exist in general.\n\nNow, checking each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object:\n\n1. X is a topological space.\n2. Y is a topological space.\n3. There exists a topological space X⊗Y.\n4. There exists a separately continuous map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n5. For every topological space Z, any separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z factors uniquely through μ via a continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z.\n\nBut wait, maybe the fifth assumption is combining two things: the universal property for all Z and all f, and the uniqueness. However, according to the problem's format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps split the fifth into two:\n\n5. For every topological space Z and separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n6. The continuous map φ in the previous assumption is unique.\n\nBut maybe that's over-splitting. The uniqueness is part of the universal property. In category theory, universal properties involve existence and uniqueness. So perhaps it's acceptable to state the universal property as a single assumption, even though it combines existence and uniqueness. However, the user's example had two separate assumptions for n being an integer and n divisible by 7. In the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate condition.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is setting up the universal property, which includes multiple conditions. But to follow the example's structure, each assumption should be a separate line. Therefore, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is a topological space.\n- Y is a topological space.\n- There exists a topological space X⊗Y.\n- There exists a separately continuous map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n- For every topological space Z, if f: X×Y → Z is separately continuous, then there exists a continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n- The continuous map φ in the previous assumption is unique.\n\nBut the problem is that in category theory, the universal property includes both existence and uniqueness. However, according to the example, each line should have one condition. So splitting existence and uniqueness into separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if uniqueness is considered a separate condition, then yes. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is a topological space.\n- Y is a topological space.\n- There exists a topological space X⊗Y.\n- There exists a separately continuous map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n- For every topological space Z and every separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n- The continuous map φ in the previous assumption is unique.\n\nBut perhaps the uniqueness is part of the same assumption. The problem is that in the original example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate assumptions, even though they both apply to n. Here, the existence and uniqueness are both part of the universal property for the tensor product. However, to strictly follow the example's format, each assumption line should address one property or condition, even if they apply to the same object. Therefore, if we can split existence and uniqueness, we should.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth assumption is the entire universal property (existence and uniqueness together), but then it's two conditions. However, the example's format allows for multiple conditions in separate lines. Therefore, it's safer to split them into separate lines.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is a topological space.\n- Y is a topological space.\n- There exists a topological space X⊗Y.\n- There exists a separately continuous map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n- For every topological space Z and every separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n- The continuous map φ in the previous assumption is unique.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a space X⊗Y does not exist in general.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentions the box topology on X×Y. Should that be included? The original question starts by saying \"Let (X, τ) and (Y, σ) be topological spaces and let (X×Y, τ×σ) be the space with the box topology.\" So this is part of the setup. However, the box topology on the product is standard when you take the product topology, but the box topology is actually different from the product topology in general. Wait, the product topology is usually the standard one with basis elements as products of open sets, but the box topology is the one where in the product, all opens are products of opens from each space, without restricting to only finitely many factors. However, in finite products, box topology and product topology are the same. Since X and Y are two spaces, X×Y with box topology is the same as the product topology. So maybe the mention of box topology here is redundant, but the user included it. Therefore, maybe we need to include that the product is equipped with the box topology as an assumption.\n\nSo adjusting:\n\nAssumption:\n- (X, τ) is a topological space.\n- (Y, σ) is a topological space.\n- The product space X×Y is equipped with the box topology τ×σ.\n- There exists a topological space X⊗Y.\n- There exists a separately continuous map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n- For every topological space Z and every separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a unique continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a space X⊗Y does not exist in general.\n\nYes, this seems better. The box topology on the product is part of the initial data. But since the problem is about the tensor product's existence, the box topology might not directly influence the result, but it's part of the given setup. Therefore, including it as an assumption.\n\nSo each assumption line by line:\n\n1. (X, τ) is a topological space.\n2. (Y, σ) is a topological space.\n3. The product space X×Y is equipped with the box topology τ×σ.\n4. There exists a topological space X⊗Y.\n5. There exists a separately continuous map μ: X×Y → X⊗Y.\n6. For every topological space Z and every separately continuous map f: X×Y → Z, there exists a unique continuous map φ: X⊗Y → Z such that f = φ∘μ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a space X⊗Y does not exist in general.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that such an X⊗Y doesn't exist in general. The assumptions are the conditions that such a space would have to satisfy. Therefore, the problem is to prove that there exist topological spaces X and Y where no such X⊗Y exists meeting those conditions.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list all the conditions (assumptions) that define the tensor product, and the problem is to show that such a tensor product doesn't always exist.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem is as above.",
