    "Content": "I initially was wondering if it were possible for there to be three $x,y,z \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\sqrt{x},\\sqrt{y},\\sqrt{z} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y} = \\sqrt{z}$. I had suspected not, but then I found $x = \\dfrac{1}{2}, y = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ and thus $\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y} = \\sqrt{2}$. I suspect there are no integer solutions where the numbers are not all square, but I couldn't prove it. Nonetheless I figured I'd ask if it were possible when $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\sqrt{x},\\sqrt{y},\\sqrt{z} \\notin \\mathbb{N}$ that $\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y} = \\sqrt{z}$? And if not, can someone prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you square both sides, you have $x + y + 2\\sqrt{xy} = z$ which can be satisfied if and only if $\\sqrt{xy}$ is an integer (it can't be a half integer). So, that's the condition, if $xy$ is a square then you're fine, otherwise, its unsolvable.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is asking whether there exist natural numbers x, y, z such that none of their square roots are natural numbers, but the sum of the square roots of x and y equals the square root of z. In other words, √x + √y = √z where x, y, z are in ℕ and √x, √y, √z are not in ℕ. \n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. We need to find three natural numbers x, y, z, none of which are perfect squares, such that when you take their square roots and add √x and √y, you get √z. If such numbers exist, we need to show an example; if not, we need to prove why it's impossible.\n\nThe user mentioned they found a rational solution with x = 1/2, y = 1/2, z = 2, but they want to know about natural numbers where the square roots are not integers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nLet's start by squaring both sides of the equation √x + √y = √z to eliminate the square roots. Squaring gives:\n\n(√x + √y)² = (√z)²  \nx + 2√(xy) + y = z  \nSo, 2√(xy) = z - x - y\n\nNow, let's denote that equation as 2√(xy) = z - x - y. For this to hold, the right-hand side (z - x - y) must be a non-negative integer because the left-hand side is a non-negative real number. However, √(xy) might not be an integer because x and y are not perfect squares. Wait, but actually, even if x and y are not perfect squares, their product xy could be a perfect square. For example, if x = 2 and y = 8, then xy = 16, which is a perfect square. But if x and y are square-free and not squares themselves, then their product would not be a perfect square. Hmm, maybe that's a direction to consider.\n\nBut let's look back at the equation. The left side is 2√(xy). If the right side is an integer (since z, x, y are all integers), then √(xy) must be rational. Because 2 times a rational number would be rational, and the right side is an integer (hence rational). Therefore, √(xy) must be rational. But since x and y are natural numbers, √(xy) being rational implies that xy is a perfect square. Because the square root of a natural number is either irrational or an integer. So, √(xy) is rational => xy is a perfect square.\n\nSo, even though x and y individually are not perfect squares, their product must be a perfect square. Let's note that down. So, xy = k² for some integer k. Now, since x and y are not perfect squares themselves, they must have prime factors with exponents that are odd, but when multiplied together, the exponents become even. So, for example, x could be 2 and y could be 8, which gives xy = 16, a perfect square. Wait, but in this case, y = 8 is not a perfect square, but x = 2 is not a perfect square either. But 2*8=16, which is a square. So, this suggests that such pairs x and y can exist where their product is a square even if neither is a square themselves.\n\nBut let's get back to the equation. We have 2√(xy) = z - x - y. Since xy is a perfect square, let's let k = √(xy), so k is an integer. Then the equation becomes 2k = z - x - y, so z = x + y + 2k.\n\nBut since xy = k², we can express this as z = x + y + 2√(xy). So, z is determined by x and y in this way. Now, the problem is that we need z to be a natural number and √z not to be a natural number. But z is x + y + 2k, where k is an integer. Let's consider if such a z can be a perfect square. Wait, no, the problem states that √z is not a natural number, so z must not be a perfect square.\n\nSo, the challenge is to find x, y, z in ℕ, none of x, y, z are perfect squares, such that z = x + y + 2√(xy) and √z is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, we can frame this in terms of variables. Let me think of x and y such that their product is a perfect square, but neither x nor y is a perfect square. Then z is defined as x + y + 2√(xy), and we need z not to be a perfect square.\n\nLet me try to construct an example. Let's take x = 2 and y = 8. Then xy = 16, which is 4². So, k = 4. Then z = 2 + 8 + 2*4 = 2 + 8 + 8 = 18. Now, z = 18, which is not a perfect square. So, √18 is irrational. Therefore, we have x = 2, y = 8, z = 18. None of these are perfect squares, and √2 + √8 = √18. Wait, let's check that.\n\nCompute √2 + √8. √8 is 2√2, so √2 + 2√2 = 3√2. Now, 3√2 = √(9*2) = √18. Yes, that's correct. So, this seems to satisfy the conditions. x = 2, y = 8, z = 18. All are natural numbers, none are perfect squares, and their square roots add up as required.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the numbers are not all square\" but in this case, z is 18, which is not a square, x and y are not squares. So, this seems to be a valid example. Therefore, such triples do exist.\n\nBut wait, the original question on Math Stack Exchange was asking if it's possible, and the user suspected not. But here, we just found an example. So maybe the answer is yes, such triples exist.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's confirm each part:\n\nx = 2: √2 ≈ 1.414, not an integer. y = 8: √8 ≈ 2.828, not an integer. z = 18: √18 ≈ 4.242, not an integer. And √2 + √8 = √18. So, yes, this works.\n\nBut perhaps there's a condition I missed. The problem states x, y, z ∈ ℕ and their square roots are not in ℕ. So, this example satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the answer is yes, it is possible. The user's initial suspicion was wrong.\n\nBut wait, the user wrote: \"I suspect there are no integer solutions where the numbers are not all square, but I couldn't prove it.\" So, they thought maybe there are no solutions, but here we have a solution. Therefore, the answer should be that such triples do exist.\n\nAnother example: Let x = 3 and y = 12. Then xy = 36 = 6², so k = 6. Then z = 3 + 12 + 2*6 = 3 + 12 + 12 = 27. √27 ≈ 5.196, not an integer. So, √3 + √12 = √27. √12 is 2√3, so √3 + 2√3 = 3√3 = √(9*3) = √27. Correct. So, x = 3, y = 12, z = 27. All non-squares.\n\nTherefore, there are infinitely many such triples. For any non-square a, take x = a, y = a*(some square) to make xy a square. Wait, more precisely, if we take x = a and y = a*b² where b is an integer, then xy = a²b² = (ab)^2, so k = ab. Then z = a + a*b² + 2ab. Let's check this with a = 2, b = 2: x = 2, y = 2*2²=8, z = 2 + 8 + 2*2*2=2+8+8=18. Which matches the earlier example.\n\nSimilarly, a = 3, b = 2: x = 3, y = 3*4=12, z=3+12+12=27. So this generalizes.\n\nTherefore, as long as we choose a natural number a which is not a perfect square, and a natural number b, then x = a, y = a*b², z = a(1 + b² + 2b) = a(b + 1)^2. Wait, wait. Wait, z = a + a*b² + 2ab = a(1 + b² + 2b) = a(b + 1)^2. So z is a*(b+1)^2. But for z to not be a perfect square, a must not be a perfect square, and (b+1)^2 multiplied by a non-square a would make z a non-square. Because if a is square-free and not 1, then multiplying by a square would still give a non-square. Wait, but if a is square-free and not 1, then a*(b+1)^2 would have a square factor (since (b+1)^2 is a square), but if a has any prime factor with an odd exponent, then the product would have that prime factor with an odd exponent plus the exponents from the square. Wait, no, because if a is square-free, then its prime factors all have exponent 1. So, a*(b+1)^2 would have exponents: for primes in a, exponent 1 + 2k (where k is the exponent in (b+1)), and for primes not in a, exponent 2k. Therefore, if a is square-free and not 1, then a*(b+1)^2 is not a square, because at least one prime in a has an odd exponent. For example, take a = 2 (square-free), b+1 = 3. Then z = 2*9 = 18, which is not a square. Similarly, a = 3, b+1 = 4: z = 3*16 = 48, which is not a square. So yes, as long as a is a square-free natural number greater than 1, then z = a*(b+1)^2 will not be a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, this construction works. So, there are infinitely many solutions where x, y, z are natural numbers, none are perfect squares, and √x + √y = √z.\n\nHence, the answer to the problem is that such triples do exist. The initial suspicion was incorrect. The example with x=2, y=8, z=18 is a valid solution. Therefore, the user's conjecture that there are no solutions is false.",
