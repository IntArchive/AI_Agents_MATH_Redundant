    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to prove that the infinite sum of Fibonacci numbers divided by 10^n converges to a rational number. First, I need to recall some properties of Fibonacci numbers and series convergence.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 3. The given series is the sum from n=1 to infinity of Fₙ / 10ⁿ. The question is asking not just for convergence but specifically that the sum is a rational number.\n\nFirst, I know that the generating function for the Fibonacci sequence is a useful tool. The generating function G(x) is the sum of Fₙ xⁿ for n from 1 to infinity. The standard generating function for Fibonacci numbers is G(x) = x / (1 - x - x²). If I substitute x with 1/10, then the sum becomes G(1/10) = (1/10) / (1 - 1/10 - (1/10)²). Let me compute that denominator: 1 - 1/10 - 1/100 = 1 - 0.1 - 0.01 = 0.89. So G(1/10) = (0.1) / 0.89 = 1/8.9. Wait, 1 divided by 8.9 is 10/89. So the sum would be 10/89, which is a rational number. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the generating function applies here. The standard generating function starts at n=1, which matches the problem's sum. So substituting x = 1/10 into G(x) gives the sum in question. Therefore, the sum equals 10/89, which is indeed a rational number. Hence, the proof is complete by using the generating function approach.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is by recognizing the series as a geometric-like series and setting up an equation. Let S be the sum. Then:\n\nS = F₁/10 + F₂/10² + F₃/10³ + ... \n\nMultiply both sides by 10:\n\n10S = F₁ + F₂/10 + F₃/10² + F₄/10³ + ... \n\nMultiply again by 10:\n\n100S = 10F₁ + F₂ + F₃/10 + F₄/10² + ... \n\nNow subtract the two equations: 100S - 10S = 10F₁ + (F₂ - F₁) + (F₃ - F₂)/10 + (F₄ - F₃)/10² + ... \n\nBut since Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂, we can substitute. Let me see:\n\n90S = 10F₁ + (F₂ - F₁) + sum from n=3 to infinity of (Fₙ - Fₙ₋₁ - Fₙ₋₂)/10^{n-2}\n\nBut Fₙ - Fₙ₋₁ - Fₙ₋₂ = 0 by the definition of Fibonacci numbers. Therefore, the sum after the first two terms is zero. So 90S = 10F₁ + (F₂ - F₁). Since F₁ = 1 and F₂ = 1, this becomes 90S = 10*1 + (1 -1) = 10. Therefore, S = 10/90 = 1/9. Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation with generating function gave 10/89. There must be a mistake here.\n\nAh, I see. Let me check the steps again. Let's define S correctly. S = F₁/10 + F₂/10² + F₃/10³ + ... So F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, F₃ = 2, etc.\n\nSo first step: S = 1/10 + 1/100 + 2/1000 + 3/10000 + 5/100000 + ...\n\nThen 10S = 1 + 1/10 + 2/100 + 3/1000 + 5/10000 + ...\n\n100S = 10 + 1 + 2/10 + 3/100 + 5/1000 + ...\n\nNow subtract 10S from 100S: 90S = 10 + (1 - 1/10) + (2/10 - 2/100) + (3/100 - 3/1000) + ... Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation S = sum Fₙ /10ⁿ. Since Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂, substitute that into the sum:\n\nS = sum (Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂)/10ⁿ for n=1 to ∞. But when n=1, F₀ is not defined in the original problem. Wait, the Fibonacci sequence here starts at n=1, so F₁=1, F₂=1, F₃=2, etc. Therefore, for n=1, the term would be F₁/10¹ = 1/10. If we try to split the sum into two parts:\n\nS = sum_{n=1}^∞ Fₙ /10ⁿ = sum_{n=1}^∞ (Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂)/10ⁿ. But for n=1, F₀ is needed, which is typically defined as 0 if we extend the sequence. Similarly, for n=2, F₁ + F₀. Let's adjust the indices.\n\nLet me shift the index. Let m = n-1. Then for n=1, m=0, but F₀ = 0, so:\n\nsum_{n=1}^∞ Fₙ /10ⁿ = sum_{m=0}^∞ F_{m+1} /10^{m+1} = (1/10) sum_{m=0}^∞ F_{m+1}/10^m.\n\nSimilarly, split the sum into two parts using the recurrence:\n\nsum_{n=1}^∞ Fₙ /10ⁿ = sum_{n=1}^∞ (Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂)/10ⁿ. Here, n starts at 3 because for n=1, F₀ is undefined, and n=2, F₁ is defined. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to use generating functions as the initial approach. The generating function method gives a clear path. Since the generating function for Fibonacci starting at n=1 is G(x) = x/(1 - x - x²). Plugging x=1/10 gives G(1/10) = (1/10)/(1 - 1/10 - (1/10)^2) = (1/10)/(1 - 0.1 - 0.01) = (1/10)/0.89 = 10/890 = 1/89? Wait, no. Wait, denominator is 1 - 1/10 - 1/100 = (100 -10 -1)/100 = 89/100. So G(1/10) = (1/10)/(89/100) = (1/10)*(100/89) = 10/89. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the sum is 10/89, which is rational. So the proof is straightforward using the generating function.\n\nAlternatively, if we set S = sum_{n=1}^∞ Fₙ/10ⁿ. Then, using the recurrence:\n\nS = F₁/10 + F₂/10² + sum_{n=3}^∞ (Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂)/10ⁿ\n\n= 1/10 + 1/100 + sum_{n=3}^∞ Fₙ₋₁/10ⁿ + sum_{n=3}^∞ Fₙ₋₂/10ⁿ\n\nShift index in the sums:\n\nFirst sum: n=3 to ∞, Fₙ₋₁/10ⁿ. Let k = n-1, so k=2 to ∞, sum becomes sum_{k=2}^∞ F_k/10^{k+1} = (1/10) sum_{k=2}^∞ F_k/10^k = (1/10)(S - F₁/10)\n\nSimilarly, second sum: n=3 to ∞, Fₙ₋₂/10ⁿ. Let m = n-2, so m=1 to ∞, sum becomes sum_{m=1}^∞ F_m/10^{m+2} = (1/10²) sum_{m=1}^∞ F_m/10^m = (1/100) S\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nS = 1/10 + 1/100 + (1/10)(S - 1/10) + (1/100) S\n\nExpand the terms:\n\nS = 0.1 + 0.01 + (0.1)(S - 0.1) + 0.01 S\n\n= 0.11 + 0.1 S - 0.01 + 0.01 S\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nS = 0.11 - 0.01 + (0.1 S + 0.01 S)\n\n= 0.10 + 0.11 S\n\nThen, S - 0.11 S = 0.10\n\n0.89 S = 0.10\n\nS = 0.10 / 0.89 = 10/89\n\nWhich confirms the generating function result. Thus, the sum converges to 10/89, a rational number. Therefore, the proof is complete.",
