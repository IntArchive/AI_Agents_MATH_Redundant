    "Content": "Prove that the union of three subspaces of V is a subspace iff one of the subspaces contains the other two. I can do this problem when I am working in only two subspaces of $V$ but I don't know how to do it with three. What I tried is:\nIf one of the subspaces contains the other two, Then their union is obviously a subspace because the subspace that contains them is a subspace. (Is this sufficient??). If the union of three subspaces is a subspace.....\nHow do I prove that one of the subspaces must contain the other two from here? *When proving this for two I said that there is an element in one of the subspaces that is not the other and proved by contradiction that one of the subspaces must be contained in the other. How would I do this for three?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The statement is false. Consider the following counterexample: Consider the vector space $V=(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{2}$ where $F=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $V_{1}$ be spanned by \n$(1,0)$. Let $V_{2}$ be spanned by $(0,1)$. Let $V_{3}$ be spanned by $(1,1)$. Then we have $V=V_{1}\\cup V_{2}\\cup V_{3}$, but none of the $V_{1},V_{2},V_{3}$ are subspace of another. You can usually count on field of characteristic $2$ to give you counterexample. There are many similar counterexample, too. In finite dimension, I think all counterexamples can be constructed this way. My intuition tells me that there are infinite dimensional counterexamples of other form, but have not checked clearly. EDIT. Here is a proof of the statement with the restriction $F\\not=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: Without loss of generality, we can assume the whole space $V$ is in fact $V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}$. Easily seen that in fact we must also have $V=V_{1}\\cup V_{2}\\cup V_{3}$. There exist $a,b\\in F$ such that $a,b\\not=0$ and $a-b=1$ (take $a$ to be anything except $0,1$, and take $b=a-1$). Assume $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ neither contains another (otherwise this reduce to the 2-subspace case). For any $u\\in V_{1}\\setminus(V_{1}\\cap V_{2})$ we take an arbitrary $w\\in V_{2}\\setminus(V_{1}\\cap V_{2})$ (it exists due to the fact that neither $V_{1}$ nor $V_{2}$ contains another). Then $au+w$ is in neither $V_{1}$ nor $V_{2}$ (if in $V_{1}$ then since $au\\in V_{1}$ we must have $w\\in V_{1}$ so $w\\in V_{1}\\cap V_{2}$ contradiction; same for the other case but now using the fact that $a\\not=0$), so $u+aw\\in V_{3}$. Same argument apply to show $bu+w\\in V_{3}$. Hence $u=(bu+w)-(au+w)\\in V_{3}$. Hence $V_{1}\\setminus(V_{1}\\cap V_{2})\\subset V_{3}$. Same argument apply to show $V_{2}\\setminus(V_{1}\\cap V_{2})\\subset V_{3}$. Now for any $v\\in V_{1}\\cap V_{2}$ we pick a $w\\in V_{2}\\setminus(V_{1}\\cap V_{2})\\subset V_{3}$. Then $w+v\\notin V_{1}\\cap V_{2}$ (otherwise $w\\in V_{1}\\cap V_{2}$). But $w+v\\in V_{2}$. Hence $w+v\\in V_{2}\\setminus(V_{1}\\cap V_{2})\\subset V_{3}$. Thus $v=(w+v)-w$ so $v\\in V_{3}$. Hence $V_{1}\\cap V_{2}\\subset V_{3}$. Therefore $V_{1},V_{2}\\subset V_{3}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. First, I need to read the original question from Math Stack Exchange carefully. The title is \"Prove that the union of three subspaces of V is a subspace iff one of the subspaces contains the other two.\" The user is asking for help in structuring this problem into the specified format, which includes listing assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, that was added as an assumption. Hmm, maybe that's part of filtering out unrelated information? Or perhaps the original problem had some hidden condition. Wait, no, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake, but maybe the user intended to show how to extract assumptions even if they are implicit? Wait, maybe the example is incorrect, but I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to prove that the union of three subspaces of V is a subspace if and only if one of the subspaces contains the other two. The original problem mentions that V is a vector space, so the subspaces are subspaces of V. The assumptions here would be related to the properties of the subspaces and the conditions under which their union is a subspace. The key points are:\n\n1. V is a vector space.\n2. There are three subspaces of V (let's call them U1, U2, U3).\n3. The union of these three subspaces is considered.\n4. The problem states an if and only if condition: the union is a subspace iff one subspace contains the other two.\n\nSo, each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let's break this down. The problem is about subspaces of V, so V being a vector space is an important assumption. Then, there are three subspaces. The union's property of being a subspace is the condition we're checking, but that's part of the problem statement. The iff condition is part of the problem statement as well.\n\nWait, the user wants the assumptions to list all the conditions given in the problem. The problem states that the union of three subspaces is a subspace iff one contains the other two. So the assumptions would include that U1, U2, U3 are subspaces of V. Then the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the user made a mistake there. Wait, maybe the example is from a different problem where n was supposed to be divisible by 7. Anyway, for the current problem, the key assumptions are that U1, U2, U3 are subspaces of V, and we are to consider their union. The problem is to show that the union is a subspace if and only if one subspace contains the other two.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- V is a vector space.\n- U1 is a subspace of V.\n- U2 is a subspace of V.\n- U3 is a subspace of V.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the union of U1, U2, U3 is a subspace of V if and only if one of the subspaces contains the other two.\n\nBut the original problem's title says \"the union of three subspaces of V is a subspace iff one of the subspaces contains the other two.\" So maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: V is a vector space.\n\nAssumption: U1, U2, U3 are subspaces of V.\n\nProblem: Prove that U1 ∪ U2 ∪ U3 is a subspace of V if and only if one of the subspaces contains the other two.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So \"V is a vector space\" is one line. Then each subspace is a subspace of V, but perhaps each listed separately? Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So if we have three subspaces, maybe each is a separate assumption.\n\nWait, but the problem states three subspaces of V. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a vector space,\nU1 is a subspace of V,\nU2 is a subspace of V,\nU3 is a subspace of V.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the union of U1, U2, and U3 is a subspace of V if and only if one of the subspaces contains the other two.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each assumption is a separate line. The problem is then to prove the equivalence.",
