    "Content": "I'm reading Hatcher and I'm doing exercise 9 on page 19. Can you tell me if my answer is correct? Exercise: Show that a retract of a contractible space is contractible. Proof: Let $X$ be a contractible space, i.e. $\\exists f :X \\rightarrow \\{ * \\}$ , $g: \\{ * \\} \\rightarrow X$ continuous such that $fg \\simeq id_{\\{ *\\}}$ and $gf \\simeq id_X$ and let $r:X \\rightarrow X$ be a retraction of $X$ i.e. $r$ continuous and $r(X) = A$ and $r\\mid_A = id_A$ . ( Edited using Anton's answer) Define $f^\\prime := f\\mid_A$ and $g^\\prime := r \\circ g$ . Now we need to show $f^\\prime \\circ g^\\prime \\simeq id_{ \\{ * \\} }$ and $g^\\prime \\circ f^\\prime \\simeq id_A$ . $f^\\prime \\circ g^\\prime \\simeq id_{ \\{ * \\} }$ follows from $f^\\prime \\circ g^\\prime = id_{ \\{ * \\} }$ (because there is only one function $\\{ * \\} \\rightarrow \\{ * \\}$ ). From $gf \\simeq id_X$ we have a homotopy $H: I \\times X \\rightarrow X$ such that $H(0,x) = g \\circ f (x)$ and $H(1,x) = id_X$ . From this we build a homotopy $H^\\prime : I \\times A \\rightarrow A$ by defining $H^\\prime := r \\circ H \\mid_{I \\times A}$ . Then $H^\\prime (0,x) = g^\\prime \\circ f\\mid_A (x)$ and $H^\\prime (1,x) = id_A$ . I'm particularly dis satisfied with the amount of detail in my reasoning but I can't seem to produce what I'm looking for. Many thanks for your help!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You're glossing over the most important things. You are given the information that $X$ is contractible. This means that there exists a specific homotopy $H:I\\times X\\to X$ which contracts the identity map. Your goal is to construct a specific homotopy $H':I\\times A\\to A$ which contracts the identity map. Your proof never explicitly makes use of $H$ and never explicitly (maybe not even implicitly) defines $H'$. This makes it feel like a bunch of symbol-pushing. (This isn't meant to be insulting; I'm just explaining why the proof feels unsatisfying.) Two preliminary points: $\\newcommand{\\pt}{{\\{\\ast\\}}}f'=f\\circ r$ isn't a map between the right things; it should be a map $A\\to\\pt$, but it's a map $X\\to \\pt$. This isn't too important since there's only one map from anything to a point, but the algebraic manipulation will be clearer if you set $f':=f|_A$. You don't need to check $f'\\circ g'\\cong id_\\pt$ since there's only one map $\\pt\\to\\pt$. So you only need to find a homotopy from $id_A$ to $g'\\circ f'$. That is, you need to make a movie (homotopy) which continuously crushes $A$ to a point. But you already have a movie $H:I\\times X\\to X$ which crushes $X$ to a point (i.e. $H(0,-)=id_X$ and $H(1,-)=g\\circ f$), and you have a way to retract anything in $X$ to something in $A$, so you can just retract your movie, setting $H' = r\\circ H|_{I\\times A}$. Then $H'(0,-) = r\\circ H(0,-)|_A = r\\circ id_A = id_A$ and $H'(1,-)=r\\circ H(1,-)|_A = r\\circ (g\\circ f)|_A = r\\circ g\\circ f|_A = g'\\circ f'$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The task is to show that a retract of a contractible space is contractible. \n\nFirst, let me recall the definitions. A contractible space X is one where the identity map id_X is homotopic to a constant map, meaning there's a homotopy that shrinks the entire space to a single point over time. A retract of X is a subspace A such that there's a retraction r: X → A, which is a continuous map that restricts to the identity on A. So, r(a) = a for all a in A.\n\nThe user's proof starts by taking the contractible space X with maps f: X → {*} and g: {*} → X, such that fg is homotopic to the identity on {*} and gf is homotopic to id_X. Then, using the retraction r, they define f' as the restriction of f to A, and g' as r composed with g. They then check the homotopy equivalences.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user mentions both fg ≃ id_{*} and gf ≃ id_X. But in a contractible space, isn't it that the identity map is homotopic to a constant map? Maybe they're using a different characterization where X is homotopy equivalent to a point. So, f: X → {*} is the constant map, and g: {*} → X picks a basepoint. Then, the composition gf is the constant map on X, and fg is the identity on {*}, which is trivial. But the homotopy equivalence requires that gf is homotopic to id_X. So that makes sense because X is contractible if it's homotopy equivalent to a point.\n\nNow, the retraction r: X → A is a continuous map with r|_A = id_A. The user defines f' = f|_A and g' = r ∘ g. Since f maps all of X to the point, f' is just the same map restricted to A. Then g' is composing the inclusion of the point into X (via g) and then retracting to A via r. Since g maps the point to some x0 in X, then r(x0) would be in A. So g' maps the point to r(x0) in A.\n\nNow, to show A is contractible, we need a homotopy equivalence between A and {*}. So f' should be the map from A to {*}, which is obviously continuous. Then g' is from {*} to A, mapping to the point r(g(*)) in A. Then, the composition f' ∘ g' is from {*} to {*}, which is the identity, so that's straightforward. The other composition g' ∘ f' is from A to A, mapping a to r(g(f(a))). But since f(a) is *, then g(*) is x0 in X, and r(x0) is some point in A. Wait, but if A is a retract, then for a in A, r(a) = a. So if we take the composition g' ∘ f', that would send a ∈ A to r(g(f(a))) = r(g(*)) which is a fixed point in A, say a0. So the composition is the constant map a0. To show that this is homotopic to the identity on A, we need a homotopy between the constant map a0 and id_A.\n\nBut the user uses the homotopy H: I × X → X from gf ≃ id_X. Then they restrict H to I × A and compose with r to get H'. So H'(t, a) = r(H(t, a)). Since H(0, x) = gf(x) and H(1, x) = x. When restricted to A, H(0, a) = gf(a) = g(*) = x0, and then r(x0) = a0 (if x0 isn't in A, but r(x0) is in A). Then H'(0, a) = r(gf(a)) = r(g(*)) = a0. H'(1, a) = r(a) = a. So this homotopy shows that the constant map a0 is homotopic to id_A. Therefore, A is contractible.\n\nBut wait, the user's original homotopy H is from gf to id_X. When restricted to A, H(t, a) starts at gf(a) and ends at a. But since r is a retraction, applying r to H(t, a) gives H'(t, a) which is a homotopy in A between r(gf(a)) and r(a) = a. But r(gf(a)) is r(g(*)) which is a0. So H' is a homotopy between the constant map a0 and the identity on A. That does the trick.\n\nHowever, the user mentions being dissatisfied with the level of detail. Let me check if there are any gaps. For example, do we need to verify that H' is continuous? Since H is continuous and r is continuous, their composition is continuous. Also, H' is defined on I × A, and since A is a subspace of X, the restriction is continuous. So H' is a valid homotopy.\n\nAnother point: the homotopy between f'g' and id_{*} is trivial because there's only one map {*} → {*}, so that's straightforward. The key part is showing g'f' ≃ id_A, which is done via H'.\n\nSo the user's proof seems correct. Maybe the dissatisfaction comes from not explicitly stating why H' is a homotopy within A. Since H(t, a) is in X, but r maps it to A, so H' indeed maps into A. Thus, H' is a homotopy in A between a0 and id_A. Therefore, A is contractible.\n\nI think the proof is correct. The user might want to elaborate on why H' is a homotopy in A, but the essential steps are there.",
