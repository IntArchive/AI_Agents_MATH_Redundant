    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"An integration of product $(1-x^n)$\", and the question is to prove the integral from 0 to 1 of the product from n=1 to infinity of (1 - x^n) dx equals a specific expression involving pi, square roots, hyperbolic sine, and cosine. The user also mentions that the product (1 - x^n) is difficult to compute and is asking for ideas.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given had assumptions that were each a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me see. The integral here is from 0 to 1, and the product is from n=1 to infinity of (1 - x^n). The assumptions here would probably be about the function being integrated, the limits of integration, and the product's convergence.\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. The original problem had an integral, so maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n1. The product is taken from n=1 to infinity.\n2. The integrand is the product of (1 - x^n) for n starting at 1 to infinity.\n3. The integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\n\nBut the problem statement itself already includes these elements. Wait, in the example provided, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, that example might have a typo. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original example problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; maybe that's an error. Wait, 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem as stated in the example might have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to present a problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". This might be a mistake in the example, but I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the user made an error. Anyway, the key point is that assumptions are properties or conditions applied to the objects in the problem. For the current problem, the integral from 0 to 1 of the infinite product (1 - x^n) dx. The product is an infinite product, so perhaps one assumption is that the product converges for x in [0,1). Also, the integral is over the interval [0,1], so maybe the convergence at x=1 needs to be considered. However, since the user is asking to compute the integral, perhaps the problem assumes that the product converges on [0,1), and the integral is proper (even though at x=1, each term becomes 0, but the infinite product might approach zero). So, possible assumptions:\n\n1. The product ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x^n) converges for x ∈ [0,1).\n2. The integral is taken over the interval [0,1].\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't mention these assumptions explicitly. The user just wrote the integral and the product. So in the example provided, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included that as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems inconsistent. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user might have intended to present a different problem where the assumption is that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". That's confusing. Maybe the example is a mistake. But perhaps I should proceed based on the problem given.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, and the product is from n=1 to infinity. The problem is to evaluate this integral and show it equals that expression. The user is asking for ideas. So, the assumptions here would be:\n\n- The product ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x^n) is considered for x in [0,1].\n- The integral is over the interval [0,1].\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions are that the infinite product converges, which it does for |x| < 1, and since we're integrating from 0 to 1, except at x=1. But the integral includes x=1, but at x=1, each term (1 - x^n) becomes 0, so the product is 0. So the integrand is 0 at x=1. But the integral is from 0 to 1, so maybe the function is integrable over that interval. However, perhaps the problem assumes that the infinite product converges uniformly on [0,1), or that the integral converges. But since the user is asking to compute it, the problem likely assumes that the integral is well-defined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond what's given. The example given included assumptions that were perhaps not all stated in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. So that suggests that maybe the assumptions include both the conditions given in the problem and any implicit conditions required for the problem to hold. But in the example, the original problem's conclusion requires divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. If n is an integer, maybe the problem actually requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but the original problem might have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example was structured incorrectly. But regardless, following the user's example, perhaps the assumptions should list all conditions necessary for the problem to hold, even if they are implicit.\n\nSo, back to the current problem. The problem is to compute the integral of the infinite product from 0 to 1. The infinite product ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x^n) is known as the Euler function, related to partitions, and it converges for |x| < 1. At x=1, the product is zero. So, the integral is over [0,1), but written as [0,1]. The convergence of the product is uniform on compact subsets of [0,1), so the integral is well-defined. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The infinite product ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x^n) converges for x ∈ [0,1).\n- The integral ∫₀¹ of the product is convergent.\n\nBut the problem statement itself includes these elements. The example given in the user's prompt lists assumptions that are explicit in the problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was that n is an integer. Then, perhaps the divisibility by 7 was part of the problem's conditions. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But 91 is 7*13. If n is any integer, then A(n) must be divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the example has an error. Maybe the original problem was intended to have n divisible by 7, but the user made a mistake. However, given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should be only the ones explicitly stated in the problem.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. For example, in the original example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then, perhaps the problem in the example had a typo where the formatted problem added an extra assumption. Alternatively, maybe the example is wrong, but I need to follow it as per the user's example.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The product is taken from n=1 to infinity.\n- The integrand is the product of (1 - x^n).\n- The integral is from x=0 to x=1.\n\nSo, each of these is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe product is taken over n from 1 to infinity,\nThe integrand is the product of (1 - x^n) for each n,\nThe integral is computed over the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe product ∏_{n=1}^∞(1 - x^n) is considered,\nThe integral is taken with respect to x over [0, 1].\n\nBut perhaps the user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", each as separate assumptions, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So, following that, the current problem's assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable in the interval [0, 1],\nThe product ∏_{n=1}^∞(1 - x^n) converges for x ∈ [0, 1),\nThe integral is over the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut maybe I should just list the essential assumptions as given in the problem. The problem says \"Prove ∫₀¹ ∏ₙ=₁^∞ (1 - xⁿ) dx = ...\", so the assumptions are that the product is from n=1 to infinity, and the integral is from 0 to 1. Each of these could be separate assumptions.\n\nBut the example given by the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is incorrect, but following the format, each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe product is defined as ∏_{n=1}^∞(1 - x^n),\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n\nEach as separate lines. So, two assumptions. Then the problem is to prove the integral equals the given expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe three assumptions: the product is infinite, the integrand is that product, and the integral is from 0 to 1. But according to the example, each assumption is a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrand is the infinite product ∏_{n=1}^∞(1 - x^n),\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut perhaps splitting into more:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each n ≥ 1, the term (1 - x^n) is considered,\nThe product is taken over all n ≥ 1,\nThe integral is with respect to x from 0 to 1.\n\nBut the example didn't split \"for each n\" into an assumption. In the example, the problem was about a number A(n) defined for every integer n, and the assumption was \"n is an integer\". So perhaps here, since the product is over n starting at 1 to infinity, the first assumption is that the product is over n=1 to infinity. Then, the integral is from 0 to 1.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe product ∏_{n=1}^∞(1 - x^n) is considered,\nThe integral ∫₀¹ is evaluated.\n\nBut maybe each assumption is a single condition. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7, which are two separate conditions. Here, perhaps the integral being over [0,1] is one assumption, and the product being infinite is another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the integral and the product. The user's problem is to compute that integral, so perhaps the assumptions are just the integral's limits and the product's form.\n\nTherefore, to follow the example's style, even if the original problem's example seems incorrect, I'll proceed by listing each explicit component as an assumption.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe product ∏_{n=1}^∞(1 - x^n) is considered,\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\int_0^1\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty(1-x^n)dx=\\frac{4\\pi\\sqrt3}{\\sqrt{23}}\\frac{\\sinh\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{23}}3}{\\cosh\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{23}}2}.$$\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. So \"The product is considered\" is one assumption, \"The integral is over [0,1]\" is another. Alternatively, \"The integrand is ∏_{n=1}^∞(1 - x^n)\" and \"The integral is from 0 to 1.\"\n\nYes, that's two separate assumptions. Each addresses one property: the integrand's form and the integral's limits.\n\nSo, final answer:",
