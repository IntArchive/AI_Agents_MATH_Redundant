    "Content": "Let $d < 0$ be a square-free integer and let $p_{1},\\ldots p_{r}$ be the prime divisors of $d$. Let $K := \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{d}]$ and consider $P_{i} := (p_{i}, \\sqrt{d}) \\subset \\mathcal{O}_{K}$. Then, the classes of $P_{1}, \\ldots P_{r}$ generate a subgroup of $Cl(K)$ isomorphic to $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{r−1}$. (standard notations: $Cl(K)$ denotes the class group of $K$, whereas $O_{K}$ is the ring of integers) I'm having trouble with this result which I heard belongs to Gauss. I can't find a proof. Can anyone help or provide a reference? Thanks! This is really interesting since we get the order of $2$ in the class number in terms of the number of prime divisors of the squarefree $d$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $\\sigma$ is the nontrivial element of Gal$(K/Q)$, one can show that $\\sigma(P_i)P_i$ is generated by $p_i$. More generally, $\\sigma(\\prod P_i)\\prod P_i$ is generated by $\\prod p_i$ for any subset of indices. Now suppose $\\prod P_i=(a+b\\sqrt{d})$. We have $(\\sigma(a+b\\sqrt{d}))(a+b\\sqrt{d})=(a^2-b^2d)=(a^2+|d|b^2)$. This generates the same ideal as $\\prod p_i$ iff $a^2+|d|b^2 = \\prod p_i$, since both are non-negative rational integers. This equation can be solved only if the product is empty, so that $a=\\pm1, b=0$, or it includes all of the primes, so that $a=0,b=\\pm1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and format it according to the user's instructions. First, I need to identify the key components: assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question starts by stating that d is a square-free integer less than 0. That's one assumption right there—d is a negative square-free integer. Then, it mentions p₁,…,pᵣ are the prime divisors of d. So another assumption is that each p_i is a prime divisor of d. \n\nNext, K is defined as Q[√d], which is the field in question. Then, P_i are ideals in the ring of integers O_K, specifically each P_i is (p_i, √d). The problem is about showing that the classes of these ideals generate a subgroup of the class group Cl(K) isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^(r−1). \n\nThe user also mentions that this result is related to Gauss and is about the order of 2 in the class number, but I think that part is more of a comment or motivation rather than part of the problem itself. The actual problem is to prove that those ideal classes generate that specific subgroup. \n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions: each condition applied to one object. The first assumption is about d being square-free and negative. Then, each p_i being a prime divisor of d. Then, K is defined as the quadratic field, and each P_i is an ideal in O_K. The problem is to show the subgroup structure in the class group. \n\nWait, the original problem statement might have more details. Let me check again. The user mentions \"Let d < 0 be a square-free integer...\", that's the first assumption. Then \"p₁,…,p_r are the prime divisors of d\"—so each p_i divides d. Then K is Q[√d], and P_i are the ideals (p_i, √d). The problem is about the classes of these P_i generating a subgroup isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^{r−1} in Cl(K). \n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n1. d is a square-free integer.\n2. d < 0.\n3. p₁,…,p_r are the prime divisors of d.\n4. K = Q[√d].\n5. Each P_i is the ideal (p_i, √d) in O_K.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Let d < 0 be a square-free integer\", which combines two conditions (d square-free and d negative). However, the user's example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate lines. So maybe we should split \"d is a square-free integer\" and \"d < 0\" into two separate assumptions. Then, the prime divisors are each prime divisors of d, K is defined as Q[√d], and each P_i is defined as those ideals. \n\nThe problem is to show that the classes of P₁,…,P_r generate a subgroup of Cl(K) isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^{r−1}. The user is asking for a proof or reference for this result. \n\nSo putting this into the required format: list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property of one object. Then state the problem. The problem should be phrased as the actual mathematical statement to prove. \n\nSo Assumptions:\n\n- d is a square-free integer.\n- d < 0.\n- p₁, p₂, …, p_r are the prime divisors of d.\n- K = Q[√d].\n- For each i, P_i is the ideal (p_i, √d) in O_K.\n\nProblem: Prove that the classes of P₁, P₂, …, P_r generate a subgroup of Cl(K) isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^{r−1}.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, the original example had a problem where the user added an assumption not present in the original. Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But wait, maybe that was a mistake? Because the original problem didn't have that. Wait, perhaps the example was wrong, but we need to follow the user's instruction regardless. \n\nWait, looking back: the user's example shows that the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, and the formatted problem lists that as an assumption, but also added \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the user said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91\". So the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, the user wants us to extract assumptions from the problem as presented. \n\nIn the current problem, the user wrote: \"Let d < 0 be a square-free integer and let p_{1},\\ldots p_{r} be the prime divisors of d. Let K := \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{d}] and consider P_{i} := (p_{i}, \\sqrt{d}) \\subset \\mathcal{O}_{K}. Then, the classes of P_{1}, \\ldots P_{r} generate a subgroup of Cl(K) isomorphic to \\left(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{r−1}.\" \n\nSo all these are given as the setup for the problem. The assumptions are:\n\n- d is a square-free integer.\n- d < 0.\n- p₁,…,p_r are the prime divisors of d.\n- K = Q[√d].\n- Each P_i is the ideal (p_i, √d) in O_K.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the classes of P₁,…,P_r generate a subgroup of Cl(K) isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^{r−1}.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list all these assumptions line by line, each as a separate bullet point, and then state the problem. The problem is the conclusion that needs to be proven.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $d$ is a square-free integer,\n- $d < 0$,\n- $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_r$ are the prime divisors of $d$,\n- $K = \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{d}]$,\n- For each $i$, $P_i = (p_i, \\sqrt{d})$ is an ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the classes of $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_r$ generate a subgroup of $\\mathrm{Cl}(K)$ isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{r-1}$.",
