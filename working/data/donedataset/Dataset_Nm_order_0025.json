    "Content": "Given an expression such as $f(x) = x^x$, is it possible to provide a thorough and rigorous proof that there is no function $F(x)$ (expressible in terms of known algebraic and transcendental functions) such that $ \\frac{d}{dx}F(x) = f(x)$? In other words, how can you rigorously prove that $f(x)$ does not have an elementary antiderivative?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To get some background and references you may start with this SE thread . Concerning your specific question about $z^z$ here is an extract from a sci.math answer by Matthew P Wiener : \"Finally, we consider the case $I(z^z)$ . So this time, let $F=C(z,l)(t)$ , the field of rational functions in $z,l,t$ , where $l=\\log z\\,$ and $t=\\exp(z\\,l)=z^z$ .  Note that $z,l,t$ are algebraically\nindependent.  (Choose some appropriate domain of definition.)  Then $t'=(1+l)t$ , so for $a=t$ in the above situation, the partial fraction\nanalysis (of the sort done in the previous posts) shows that the only possibility is for $v=wt+\\cdots$ to be the source of the $t$ term on the left,\nwith $w$ in $C(z,l)$ . So this means, equating $t$ coefficients, $1=w'+(l+1)w$ .  This is a first order ODE, whose solution is $w=\\frac{I(z^z)}{z^z}$ .  So we must prove that no\nsuch $w$ exists in $C(z,l)$ . So suppose (as in one of Ray Steiner's posts) $w=\\frac PQ$ , with $P,Q$ in $C[z,l]$ and having no common factors.  Then $z^z=\n\\left(z^z\\cdot \\frac PQ\\right)'=z^z\\cdot\\frac{[(1+l)PQ+P'Q-PQ']}{Q^2}$ , or $Q^2=(1+l)PQ+P'Q-PQ'$ . So $Q|Q'$ , meaning $Q$ is a constant, which we may assume to be one.  So we have it down to $P'+P+lP=1$ . Let $P=\\sum_{i=0}^n [P_i l^i]$ , with $P_i, i=0\\cdots n \\in C[z]$ .  But then in our equation, there's a dangling $P_n l^{n+1}$ term, a contradiction.\" $$-$$ For future references here is a complete re-transcript of Matthew P Wiener's $1997$ sci.math article (converted in $\\LaTeX$ by myself : feel free to fix it!). A neat translation in french by Denis Feldmann is available at his homepage . What's the antiderivative of $\\ e^{-x^2}\\ $ ? of $\\ \\frac{\\sin(x)}x\\ $ ? of $\\ x^x\\ $ ? These, and some similar problems, can't be done. More precisely, consider the notion of \"elementary function\". These are the functions that can be expressed in terms of exponentals and logarithms, via the usual algebraic processes, including the solving (with or without radicals) of polynomials. Since the trigonometric functions and their inverses can be expressed in terms of exponentials and logarithms using the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ , these too are elementary. The elementary functions are, so to speak, the \"precalculus functions\". Then there is a theorem that says certain elementary functions do not\nhave an elementary antiderivative.  They still have antiderivatives,\nbut \"they can't be done\".  The more common ones get their own names.\nUp to some scaling factors, \" $\\mathrm{erf}$ \" is the antiderivative of $e^{-x^2}$ and \" $\\mathrm{Si}$ \" is the antiderivative of $\\frac{\\sin(x)}x$ , and so on. For those with a little bit of undergraduate algebra, we sketch a proof\nof these, and a few others, using the notion of a differential field.\nThese are fields $(F,+,\\cdot,1,0)$ equipped with a derivation, that is, a\nunary operator $'$ satisfying $(a+b)'=a'+b'$ and $(a.b)'=a.b'+a'.b$ .  Given\na differential field $F$ , there is a subfield $\\mathrm{Con}(F)=\\{a:a'=0\\}$ , called the constants of $F$ .  We let $I(f)$ denote an antiderivative.  We ignore $+C$ s. Most examples in practice are subfields of $M$ , the meromorphic functions on $\\mathbb{C}$ (or some domain).  Because of uniqueness of analytic extensions, one rarely has to specify the precise domain. Given differential fields $F$ and $G$ , with $F$ a subfield of $G$ , one calls $G$ an algebraic extension of $F$ if $G$ is a finite field extension of $F$ . One calls $G$ a logarithmic extension of $F$ if $G=F(t)$ for some transcendental $t$ that satisfies $t'=\\dfrac{s'}s$ , some $s$ in $F$ .  We may think of $t$ as $\\;\\log s$ , but note that we are not actually talking about a logarithm function on $F$ .\nWe simply have a new element with the right derivative. Other \"logarithms\" would have to be adjoined as needed. Similarly, one calls $G$ an exponential extension of $F$ if $G=F(t)$ for some transcendental $t$ that satisfies $t'=t.s'$ , some $s$ in $F$ .  Again, we may think of $t$ as $\\;\\exp s$ , but there is no actual exponential function on $F$ . Finally, we call $G$ an elementary differential extension of $F$ if there is a finite chain of subfields from $F$ to $G$ , each an algebraic, logarithmic, or exponential extension of the next smaller field. The following theorem, in the special case of $M$ , is due to Liouville.\nThe algebraic generality is due to Rosenlicht.  More powerful theorems have been proven by Risch, Davenport, and others, and are at the heart of symbolic integration packages. A short proof, accessible to those with a solid background in undergraduate algebra, can be found in Rosenlicht's AMM paper (see references).  It is probably easier to master its applications first, which often use similar techniques, and then learn the proof. MAIN THEOREM .  Let $F,G$ be differential fields, let $a$ be in $F$ , let $y$ be in $G$ , and suppose $y'=a$ and $G$ is an elementary differential extension field of $F$ , and $\\mathrm{Con}(F)=\\mathrm{Con}(G)$ .  Then there exist $c_1,...,c_n \\in \\mathrm{Con}(F), u_1,\\cdots,u_n, v\\in F$ such that $$a  =  c_1\\frac{u_1'}{u_1}+ ... + c_n\\frac{u_n'}{u_n}+ v'$$ That is, the only functions that have elementary antiderivatives are the ones that have this very specific form.  In words, elementary integrals always consist of a function at the same algebraic \"complexity\" level as the starting function (the $v$ ), along with the logarithms of functions at the same algebraic \"complexity\" level (the $u_i$ 's). This is a very useful theorem for proving non-integrability.  Because this topic is of interest, but it is only written up in bits and pieces, I give numerous examples.  (Since the original version of this FAQ from way back when, two how-to-work-it write-ups have appeared.  See Fitt & Hoare and Marchisotto & Zakeri in the references.) In the usual case, $F,G$ are subfields of $M$ , so $\\mathrm{Con}(F)=\\mathrm{Con}(G)$ always holds, both being $\\mathbb{C}$ .  As a side comment, we remark that this equality is necessary.\nOver $\\mathbb{R}(x)$ , $\\frac 1{1+x^2}$ has an elementary antiderivative, but none of the above form. We first apply this theorem to the case of integrating $f\\cdot\\exp(g)$ , with $f$ and $g$ rational functions.  If $g=0$ , this is just $f$ , which can be integrated\nvia partial fractions.  So assume $g$ is nonzero.  Let $t=\\exp(g)$ , so $t'=g't$ .\nSince $g$ is not zero, it has a pole somewhere (perhaps out at infinity), so $\\exp(g)$ has an essential singularity, and thus $t$ is transcendental over $C(z)$ .  Let $F=C(z)(t)$ , and let $G$ be an elementary differential extension containing an antiderivative for $f\\cdot t$ . Then Liouville's theorem applies, so we can write $$f\\cdot t =  c_1\\frac{u_1'}{u_1} + \\cdots + c_n \\frac{u_n'}{u_n} + v'$$ with the $c_i$ constants and the $u_i$ and $v$ in $F$ .  Each $u_i$ is a ratio of two $C(z)[t]$ polynomials, $\\dfrac UV$ say.  But $\\dfrac {(U/V)'}{U/V}=\\dfrac {U'}U-\\dfrac{V'}V$ (quotient rule), so we may rewrite the above and assume each $u_i$ is in $C(z)[t]$ .\nAnd if any $u_i=U\\cdot V$ factors, then $\\dfrac{(U\\cdot V)'}{(U\\cdot V)}=\\dfrac {U'}U+\\dfrac {V'}V$ and so we can further assume each $u_i$ is irreducible over $C(z)$ . What does a typical $\\frac {u'}u$ look like?  For example, consider the case of $u$ quadratic in $t$ .  If $A,B,C$ are rational functions in $C(z)$ , then $A',B',C'$ are also rational functions in $C(z)$ and \\begin{align}\n\\frac {(A.t^2+B.t+C)'}{A.t^2+B.t+C} &= \\frac{A'.t^2 + 2At(gt) + B'.t + B.(gt) + C'}{A.t^2 + B.t + C}\\\\\n&= \\frac{(A'+2Ag).t^2 + (B'+Bg).t + C'}{A.t^2 + B.t + C}\\\\\n\\end{align} (Note that contrary to the usual situation, the degree of a polynomial in $t$ stays the same after differentiation.  That is because we are taking derivatives with respect to $z$ , not $t$ .  If we write this out explicitly, we get $(t^n)' = \\exp(ng)' = ng'\\cdot \\exp(ng) = ng'\\cdot t^n$ .) In general, each $\\frac {u'}u$ is a ratio of polynomials of the same degree.  We can, by doing one step of a long division, also write it as $D+\\frac Ru$ , for some $D \\in C(z)$ and $R \\in C(z)[t]$ , with $\\deg(R)<\\deg(u)$ . By taking partial fractions, we can write $v$ as a sum of a $C(z)[t]$ polynomial\nand some fractions $\\frac P{Q^n}$ with $\\deg(P)<\\deg(Q)$ , $Q$ irreducible, with each $P,Q \\in C(z)[t]$ . $v'$ will thus be a polynomial plus partial fraction like terms. Somehow, this is supposed to come out to just $f\\cdot t$ .  By the uniqueness of partial fraction decompositions, all terms other than multiples of $t$ add up to $0$ .  Only the polynomial part of $v$ can contribute to $f\\cdot t$ , and this must be a monomial over $C(z)$ .  So $f\\cdot t=(h\\cdot t)'$ , for some rational $h$ .  (The temptation to assert $v=h\\cdot t$ here is incorrect, as there could be some $C(z)$ term, cancelled by $\\frac {u'}u$ terms.  We only need to identify the terms in $v$ that contribute to $f\\cdot t$ , so this does not matter.) Summarizing, if $f\\cdot \\exp(g)$ has an elementary antiderivative, with $f$ and $g$ rational functions, $g$ nonzero, then it is of the form $h\\cdot \\exp(g)$ , with $h$ rational. We work out particular examples, of this and related applications.  A bracketed function can be reduced to the specified example by a change of variables. $\\quad\\boxed{\\displaystyle\\exp\\bigl(z^2\\bigr)}$ $\\quad\\left[\\sqrt{z}\\cdot\\exp(z),\\frac{\\exp(z)}{\\sqrt{z}}\\right]$ Let $h\\cdot \\exp\\bigl(z^2\\bigr)$ be its antiderivative.  Then $h'+2zh=1$ . Solving this ODE gives $h=\\exp(-z^2)\\cdot I\\left(\\exp\\bigl(z^2\\bigr)\\right)$ , which has no pole (except perhaps at infinity), so $h$ , if rational, must be a polynomial.  But the derivative of $h$ cannot cancel the leading power of $2zh$ , contradiction. $\\quad\\boxed{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\exp(z)}z}$ $\\quad\\left[\\exp(\\exp(z)),\\frac 1{\\log(z)}\\right]$ Let $h\\cdot \\exp(z)$ be an antiderivative.  Then $h'+h=\\frac 1z$ .  I know of two quick ways to prove that $h$ is not rational. One can explicitly solve the first order ODE (getting $\\exp(-z)\\cdot I\\left(\\frac{\\exp(z)}z\\right))$ , and then notice that the solution has a logarithmic singularity at zero.\nFor example, $h(z)\\to\\infty$ but $\\sqrt{z}\\cdot h(z)\\to 0$ as $z\\to 0$ .  No rational function does this. Or one can assume $h$ has a partial fraction decomposition.  Obviously no $h'$ term will give $\\frac 1z$ , so $\\frac 1z$ must be present in $h$ already. But $\\left(\\frac 1z\\right)'=-\\frac 1{z^2}$ ,\nand this is part of $h'$ .  So there is a $\\frac 1{z^2}$ in $h$ to cancel this.  But $\\left(\\frac 1{z^2}\\right)'$ is $-\\frac 2{z^3}$ , and this is again part of $h'$ .  And again, something in $h$ cancels this, etc etc etc.  This infinite regression is impossible. $\\quad\\boxed{\\displaystyle\\frac {\\sin(z)}z}$ $\\quad[\\sin(\\exp(z))]$ $\\quad\\boxed{\\displaystyle\\sin\\bigl(z^2\\bigr)}$ $\\quad\\left[\\sqrt{z}\\sin(z),\\frac{\\sin(z)}{\\sqrt{z}}\\right]$ Since $\\sin(z)=\\frac 1{2i}[\\exp(iz)-\\exp(-iz)]$ , we merely rework the above $f\\cdot \\exp(g)$ result.  Let $f$ be rational, let $t=\\exp(iz)$ (so $\\frac {t'}t=i$ ) and let $T=\\exp(iz^2)$ (so $\\frac{T'}T=2iz$ ) and we want an antiderivative of either $\\frac 1{2i}f\\cdot\\left(t-\\frac 1t\\right)$ or $\\frac 1{2i}f\\cdot(T-\\frac 1T)$ .  For the former, the same partial fraction results still apply in identifying $\\frac 1{2i}f\\cdot t=(h\\cdot t)'=(h'+ih)\\cdot t$ , which can't happen for $f=\\frac 1z$ , as above.  In the case of $f\\cdot\\sin\\bigl(z^2\\bigr)$ , we want $\\frac 1{2i}f\\cdot T=(h\\cdot T)'=(h'+2izh)\\cdot T$ , and again, this can't happen for $f=1$ , as above. Although done, we push this analysis further in the $f\\cdot \\sin(z)$ case, as there are extra terms hanging around.  This time around, the conclusion gives an additional $\\frac kt$ term inside $v$ , so we have $-\\frac 1{2i}\\frac ft=\\left(\\frac kt\\right)'=\\frac{k'-ik}t$ .\nSo the antiderivative of $\\frac 1{2i}f\\cdot\\left(t-\\frac 1t\\right)$ is $h\\cdot t+\\frac kt$ . If $f$ is even and real, then $h$ and $k$ (like $t=\\exp(iz)$ and $\\frac 1t=\\exp(-iz)$ ) are parity flips of each other, so (as expected) the antiderivative is even. Letting $C=\\cos(z), S=\\sin(z), h=H+iF$ and $k=K+iG$ , the real (and only) part of the antiderivative of $f$ is $(HC-FS)+(KC+GS)=(H+K)C+(G-F)S$ . So over the reals, we find that the antiderivative of (rational even). $\\sin(x)$ is of the form (rational even). $\\cos(x)+$ (rational odd). $\\sin(x)$ . A similar result holds for (odd) $\\cdot\\sin(x)$ , (even) $\\cdot\\cos(x)$ , (odd) $\\cdot\\cos(x)$ .\nAnd since a rational function is the sum of its (rational) even and odd parts, (rational) $\\cdot\\sin$ integrates to (rational) $\\cdot\\sin$ + (rational) $\\cdot\\cos$ , or not at all. Let's backtrack, and apply this to $\\dfrac {\\sin(x)}x$ directly, using reals only.\nIf it has an elementary antiderivative, it must be of the form $E\\cdot S+O\\cdot C$ .\nTaking derivatives gives $(E'-O)\\cdot S+(E+O')\\cdot C$ .  As with partial fractions, we have a unique $R(x)[S,C]$ representation here (this is a bit tricky, as $S^2=1-C^2$ : this step can be proven directly or via solving for $t, \\frac 1t$ coefficients over $C$ ).  So $E'-O=\\frac 1x$ and $E+O'=0$ , or $O''+O=-\\frac 1x$ .\nExpressing $O$ in partial fraction form, it is clear only $(-\\frac 1x)$ in $O$ can contribute a $-\\frac 1x$ .  So there is a $-\\frac 2{x^3}$ term in $O''$ , so there is a $\\frac 2{x^3}$ term in $O$ to cancel it, and so on, an infinite regress.  Hence, there is no such rational $O$ . $\\quad\\boxed{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\arcsin(z)}z}$ $\\quad[z.\\tan(z)]$ We consider the case where $F=C(z,Z)(t)$ as a subfield of the meromorphic functions on some domain, where $z$ is the identify function, $Z=\\sqrt{1-z^2}$ , and $t=\\arcsin z$ .  Then $Z'=-\\frac zZ$ , and $t'=\\frac 1Z$ .  We ask in the main theorem result if this can happen with $a=\\frac tz$ and some field $G$ . $t$ is transcendental over $C(z,Z)$ , since it has infinite branch points. So we consider the more general situation of $f(z)\\cdot \\arcsin(z)$ where $f(z)$ is rational in $z$ and $\\sqrt{1-z^2}$ .  By letting $z=\\frac {2w}{1+w^2}$ , note that members of $C(z,Z)$ are always elementarily integrable. Because $x^2+y^2-1$ is irreducible, $\\frac{C[x,y]}{x^2+y^2-1}$ is an integral domain, $C(z,Z)$ is isomorphic to its field of quotients in the obvious manner, and $C(z,Z)[t]$ is a UFD whose field of quotients is amenable to partial fraction analysis in the variable $t$ .  What follows takes place at times in various $z$ -algebraic extensions of $C(z,Z)$ (which may not have unique factorization), but the terms must combine to give something in $C(z,Z)(t)$ , where partial fraction decompositions are unique, and hence the $t$ term will be as claimed. Thus, if we can integrate $f(z)\\cdot\\arcsin(z)$ , we have $f\\cdot t$ = $\\sum$ of $\\frac {u'}u s$ and $v'$ , by the main theorem. The $u$ terms can, by logarithmic differentiation in the appropriate algebraic extension field (recall that roots are analytic functions of\nthe coefficients, and $t$ is transcendental over $C(z,Z)$ ), be assumed to all be linear $t+r$ , with $r$ algebraic over $z$ .  Then $\\frac {u'}u=\\frac {1/Z+r'}{t+r}$ .\nWhen we combine such terms back in $C(z,Z)$ , they don't form a $t$ term (nor any higher power of $t$ , nor a constant). Partial fraction decomposition of $v$ gives us a polynomial in $t$ , with coefficients in $C(z,Z)$ , plus multiples of powers of linear $t$ terms.\nThe latter don't contribute to a $t$ term, as above. If the polynomial is linear or quadratic, say $v=g\\cdot t^2 + h\\cdot t + k$ , then $v'=g'\\cdot t^2 + \\left(\\frac{2g}Z+h'\\right)\\cdot t + \\left(\\frac hZ+k'\\right)$ .  Nothing can cancel the $g'$ , so $g$ is just a constant $c$ .  Then $\\frac {2c}Z+h'=f$ or $I(f\\cdot t)=2c\\cdot t+I(h'\\cdot t)$ .  The $I(h'.t)$ can be integrated by parts.  So the antiderivative works out to $c\\cdot(\\arcsin(z))^2 + h(z)\\cdot \\arcsin(z) - I\\left(\\frac{h(z)}{\\sqrt{1-z^2}}\\right)$ , and as observed above, the latter is elementary. If the polynomial is cubic or higher, let $v=A.t^n+B.t^{n-1}+\\cdots$ , then $v'=A'.t^n + \\left(n\\cdot\\frac AZ+B'\\right).t^{n-1} +\\cdots$ $A$ must be a constant $c$ .  But then $\\frac{nc}Z+B'=0$ , so $B=-nct$ , contradicting $B$ being in $C(z,Z)$ . In particular, since $\\frac 1z + \\frac c{\\sqrt{1-z^2}}$ does not have a rational in \" $z$ and/or $\\sqrt{1-z^2}$ \" antiderivative, $\\frac {\\arcsin(z)}z$ does not have an elementary integral. $\\quad\\boxed{\\displaystyle z^z}$ In this case, let $F=C(z,l)(t)$ , the field of rational functions in $z,l,t$ , where $l=\\log z$ and $t=\\exp(z\\,l)=z^z$ .  Note that $z,l,t$ are algebraically independent.  (Choose some appropriate domain of definition.)  Then $t'=(1+l)t$ , so for $a=t$ in the above situation, the partial fraction analysis (of the sort done in the previous posts) shows that the only possibility is for $v=wt+\\cdots$ to be the source of the $t$ term on the left, with $w$ in $C(z,l)$ . So this means, equating $t$ coefficients, $1=w'+(l+1)w$ .  This is a first order ODE, whose solution is $w=\\frac{I(z^z)}{z^z}$ .  So we must prove that no such $w$ exists in $C(z,l)$ .  So suppose (as in one of Ray Steiner's posts) $w=P/Q$ , with $P,Q$ in $C[z,l]$ and having no common factors.  Then $z^z= \\left(z^z\\cdot \\frac PQ\\right)'=z^z\\cdot\\frac{[(1+l)PQ+P'Q-PQ']}{Q^2}$ , or $Q^2=(1+l)PQ+P'Q-PQ'$ . So $Q|Q'$ , meaning $Q$ is a constant, which we may assume to be one.  So we have it down to $P'+P+lP=1$ . Let $P=\\sum_{i=0}^n [P_i l^i]$ , with $P_i, i=0\\cdots n \\in C[z]$ .  But then in our equation, there's a dangling $P_n l^{n+1}$ term, a contradiction. On a slight tangent, this theorem of Liouville will not tell you that Bessel functions are not elementary, since they are defined by second order ODEs.  This can be proven using differential Galois theory.  A variant of the above theorem of Liouville, with a different normal form, does show however that $J_0$ cannot be integrated in terms of elementary methods augmented with Bessel functions. What follows is a fairly complete sketch of the proof of the Main Theorem.\nFirst, I just state some easy (if you've had Galois Theory 101) lemmas. Throughout the lemmas $F$ is a differential field, and $t$ is transcendental over $F$ . Lemma $1$ : If $K$ is an algebraic extension field of $F$ , then there exists a unique way to extend the derivation map from $F$ to $K$ so as to make $K$ into\na differential field. Lemma $2$ : If $K=F(t)$ is a differential field with derivation extending $F$ 's, and $t'$ is in $F$ , then for any polynomial $f(t)$ in $F[t]$ , $f(t)'$ is a\npolynomial in $F[t]$ of the same degree (if the leading coefficient is not in $\\mathrm{Con}(F)$ ) or of degree one less (if the leading coefficient is in $\\mathrm{Con}(F)$ ). Lemma $3$ : If $K=F(t)$ is a differential field with derivation extending $F$ 's, and $\\frac{t'}t$ is in $F$ , then for any $a$ in $F$ , $n$ a positive integer, there exists $h$ in $F$ such that $(a\\cdot t^n)'=h\\cdot t^n$ .  More generally, if $f(t)$ is any polynomial in $F[t]$ , then $f(t)'$ is of the same degree as $f(t)$ , and is a multiple of $f(t)$ iff $f(t)$ is a monomial. These are all fairly elementary.  For example, $(a\\cdot t^n)'=\\bigl(a'+a\\frac {t'}t\\bigr)\\cdot t^n$ in lemma $3$ .  The final 'iff' in lemma $3$ is where transcendence of $t$ comes in.  Lemma $1$ in the usual case of subfields of $M$ is an easy consequence of the implicit function theorem. MAIN THEOREM .  Let $F,G$ be differential fields, let $a$ be in $F$ , let $y$ be in $G$ , and suppose $y'=a$ and $G$ is an elementary differential extension field of $F$ , and $\\mathrm{Con}(F)=\\mathrm{Con}(G)$ .  Then there exist $c_1,...,c_n \\in \\mathrm{Con}(F), u_1,\\cdots,u_n, v\\in F$ such that $$(*)\\quad a  =  c_1\\frac{u_1'}{u_1}+ ... + c_n\\frac{u_n'}{u_n}+ v'$$ In other words, the only functions that have elementary antiderivatives are the ones that have this very specific form. Proof: By assumption there exists a finite chain of fields connecting $F$ to $G$ such that the extension from one field to the next is given by performing an algebraic, logarithmic, or exponential extension.  We show that if the form $(*)$ can be satisfied with values in $F2$ , and $F2$ is one of the three kinds of allowable extensions of $F1$ , then the form $(*)$ can be satisfied in $F1$ .  The form $(*)$ is obviously satisfied in $G$ : let all the $c$ 's be $0$ , the $u$ 's be $1$ , and let $v$ be the original $y$ for which $y'=a$ .  Thus, if the form $(*)$ can be pulled down one field, we will be able to pull it down to $F$ , and the theorem holds. So we may assume without loss of generality that $G=F(t)$ . Case $1$ : $t$ is algebraic over $F$ .  Say $t$ is of degree $k$ .  Then there are polynomials $U_i$ and $V$ such that $U_i(t)=u_i$ and $V(t)=v$ .  So we have $$a =  c_1 \\frac{U_1(t)'}{U_1(t)} +\\cdots + c_n \\frac{ U_n(t)'}{U_n(t)} + V(t)'$$ Now, by the uniqueness of extensions of derivatives in the algebraic case, we may replace $t$ by any of its conjugates $t_1,\\cdots, t_k,$ and the same equation holds.  In other words, because $a$ is in $F$ , it is fixed under the Galois automorphisms.  Summing up over the conjugates, and converting the $\\frac {U'}U$ terms into products using logarithmic differentiation, we have $$k a =  c_1 \\frac{[U_1(t_1)\\times\\cdots\\times U_1(t_k)]'}{U_1(t_1)\\times \\cdots \\times U_n(t_k)}+ \\cdots + [V(t_1)+\\cdots +V(t_k)]'$$ But the expressions in $[\\cdots]$ are symmetric polynomials in $t_i$ , and as they are polynomials with coefficients in $F$ , the resulting expressions are in $F$ .  So dividing by $k$ gives us $(*)$ holding in $F$ . Case $2$ : $t$ is logarithmic over $F$ .  Because of logarithmic differentiation we may assume that the $u$ 's are monic and irreducible in $t$ and distinct.\nFurthermore, we may assume v has been decomposed into partial fractions.\nThe fractions can only be of the form $\\dfrac f{g^j}$ , where $\\deg(f)<\\deg(g)$ and $g$ is monic irreducible.  The fact that no terms outside of $F$ appear on the left hand side of $(*)$ , namely just $a$ appears, means a lot of cancellation must be occuring. Let $t'=\\dfrac{s'}s$ , for some $s$ in $F$ .  If $f(t)$ is monic in $F[t]$ , then $f(t)'$ is also in $F[t]$ , of one less degree.  Thus $f(t)$ does not divide $f(t)'$ .  In particular, all the $\\dfrac{u'}u$ terms are in lowest terms already.  In the $\\dfrac f{g^j}$ terms in $v$ , we have $a g^{j+1}$ denominator contribution in $v'$ of the form $-jf\\dfrac{g'}{g^{j+1}}$ .\nBut $g$ doesn't divide $fg'$ , so no cancellation occurs.  But no $\\dfrac{u'}u$ term can cancel, as the $u$ 's are irreducible, and no $\\dfrac{(**)}{g^{j+1}}$ term appears in $a$ , because $a$ is a member of $F$ .  Thus no $\\dfrac f{g^j}$ term occurs at all in $v$ .\nBut then none of the $u$ 's can be outside of $F$ , since nothing can cancel them. (Remember the $u$ 's are distinct, monic, and irreducible.)  Thus each of the $u$ 's is in $F$ already, and $v$ is a polynomial.  But $v' = a -$ expression in $u$ 's, so $v'$ is in $F$ also.  Thus $v = b t + c$ for some $b$ in $\\mathrm{con}(F)$ , $c$ in $F$ , by lemma 2.  Then $$a=  c_1 \\frac{u_1'}{u_1} +\\cdots + c_n\\frac{u_n'}{u_n} + b \\frac{s'}s + c'$$ is the desired form.  So case 2 holds. Case $3$ : $t$ is exponential over $F$ .  So let $\\dfrac {t'}t=s'$ for some $s$ in $F$ .  As in case 2 above, we may assume all the $u$ 's are monic, irreducible, and distinct and put $v$ in partial fraction decomposition form.  Indeed the argument is identical as in case 2 until we try to conclude what form $v$ is.  Here lemma 3 tells us that $v$ is a finite sum of terms $b\\cdot t^j$ where each coefficient is in $F$ .  Each of the $u$ 's is also in $F$ , with the possible exception that one of them may be $t$ .  Thus every $\\dfrac {u'}u$ term is in $F$ , so again we conclude $v'$ is in $F$ .  By lemma 3, $v$ is in $F$ .  So if every $u$ is in $F$ , $a$ is in the desired form.  Otherwise, one of the $u$ 's, say $u_n$ , is actually $t$ , then $$a =  c_1\\frac{u_1'}{u_1} + \\cdots + (c_n s + v)'$$ is the desired form.  So case 3 holds.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"How to determine with certainty that a function has no elementary antiderivative?\" The question asks, given a function like f(x) = x^x, how to rigorously prove that there's no elementary F(x) such that F'(x) = f(x). They want to know the method to show that f(x) lacks an elementary antiderivative.\n\nNow, according to the user's example, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. In the example, assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, the user is asking about proving a general function (like x^x) has no elementary antiderivative. \n\nWait, the original problem doesn't specify any particular conditions on f(x) other than it's given (like x^x). The user wants to know the method to prove such a thing. However, in the assumption section, we need to list the problem's assumptions. But in this case, the function f(x) is x^x, which is the example. The problem is about determining if any given function (like x^x) has no elementary antiderivative.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions here are implicit. Let me think. For the function f(x) = x^x, what are the assumptions? The function is defined for x > 0, perhaps. But the problem is not about solving for x in a domain, but about the existence of an elementary antiderivative.\n\nWait, the problem is a general question: \"how can you rigorously prove that f(x) does not have an elementary antiderivative?\" The example given is x^x, but the problem is about the method. However, the user wants the problem structured with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the user listed those as assumptions. Here, perhaps the assumptions would be about the function f(x) being x^x and maybe its domain? Or perhaps there are no explicit assumptions given in the problem, but the problem is general.\n\nWait, the original question is asking for a method to prove that a given function (like x^x) has no elementary antiderivative. The problem as stated is about how to do that. But the user wants me to structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. So perhaps the assumption here is that f(x) is a given function (like x^x), and the problem is to prove that there's no elementary F(x) with F' = f(x).\n\nBut maybe the assumptions need to be more specific. For example, in the case of x^x, the function is non-elementary, but the question is about proving that no elementary antiderivative exists. The problem might assume that f(x) is defined in terms of elementary functions but its antiderivative is not elementary.\n\nWait, perhaps the key here is that the question is asking about the method, but in the example given, the user converted the original problem into assumptions and problem. So here, the original problem is about \"Given an expression such as f(x) = x^x, how to prove it has no elementary antiderivative?\" So the assumption would be that f(x) is x^x, and the problem is to prove that there's no elementary F(x) such that F' = f(x).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a condition on the variables or objects in the problem. In this case, the function f(x) = x^x is given. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x^x,\nF(x) is an elementary function,\nthe derivative of F(x) is f(x).\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that such an F(x) does not exist. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The problem states: given f(x) = x^x, prove that there's no elementary F(x) with F' = f(x). So the assumptions here would be that f(x) is x^x, and the problem is to show no elementary antiderivative exists.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't have any explicit assumptions beyond the function being x^x. Wait, the original question is more general: \"how can you rigorously prove that f(x) does not have an elementary antiderivative?\" But the example given uses x^x. So perhaps the problem is to prove that for f(x) = x^x, there is no elementary antiderivative. Then the assumption would be f(x) = x^x.\n\nBut in the example, the user rephrased the problem into an assumption and problem. So applying that here:\n\nOriginal problem: Given f(x) = x^x, prove no elementary F(x) exists such that F' = f(x).\n\nAssumptions would be:\n\nf(x) = x^x,\n\nF(x) is an elementary function,\n\nthe derivative of F(x) is f(x).\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that such F(x) does not exist. So maybe the assumptions are the conditions on f(x). Hmm, perhaps in this case, the only assumption is that f(x) = x^x. Then the problem is to prove that there's no elementary F(x) with F' = f(x).\n\nBut in the example, the user included two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition. For this problem, maybe the assumption is just f(x) = x^x. But maybe the problem is more general. The question starts with \"Given an expression such as f(x) = x^x\", so it's about any such function, but the specific example is x^x.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might assume that f(x) is expressed in terms of elementary functions but that its antiderivative is not elementary. However, the user's example took the specific function given and listed assumptions about n. So here, perhaps the assumption is that f(x) is x^x, and the problem is to prove that there's no elementary antiderivative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions include that F(x) is an elementary function (as part of the problem's context). But according to the example, the assumptions are about the objects in the problem. For instance, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions would be about the function f(x) = x^x and the nature of F(x) (being elementary).\n\nBut the user's example didn't have assumptions about the structure of A(n); it was about the variable n. So here, perhaps the assumption is simply f(x) = x^x, and the problem is to prove that no elementary F(x) exists such that F'(x) = f(x).\n\nWait, but the user's example included two separate assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each on its own line. So in this problem, the only assumption given is that f(x) = x^x, but maybe another assumption is that we're considering elementary antiderivatives. However, the problem states that F(x) must be expressible in terms of known algebraic and transcendental functions. So perhaps that's part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. f(x) = x^x.\n\n2. F(x) is expressible in terms of known algebraic and transcendental functions.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such an F(x) does not exist. However, in the example, the assumptions are conditions that are given. For the problem here, the user is asking, given f(x), how to prove no such F(x) exists. So maybe the assumption is only f(x) = x^x, and the problem is to show no elementary antiderivative exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are that the function is x^x and that we are considering antiderivatives in the elementary functions. But the example didn't list \"A(n) is defined as...\" as an assumption, but rather listed conditions on n. So perhaps here, the assumption is just the function f(x) = x^x.\n\nHmm. Let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the user included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7. Wait, the example might be incorrect? Wait, no. Wait the example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumptions should be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in their formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which would actually change the problem.\n\nWait, this is confusing. The user provided an example where they restructured a problem. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But that's different from the original problem. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example, or perhaps they intended to filter out some parts. Wait, perhaps the original problem had some extra conditions, but in the example given, the user might have modified it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is illustrative, and in their actual task, they want me to filter the original problem's information to list the correct assumptions. So applying that to the current problem.\n\nThe current problem's title is about determining with certainty that a function has no elementary antiderivative, using the example of f(x) = x^x. The question is asking for a rigorous proof method.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, I need to structure the problem as:\n\nAssumption: list each assumption line by line.\n\nProblem: the problem statement.\n\nSo for the given problem, the original question is: Given f(x) = x^x, how to prove it has no elementary antiderivative.\n\nThus, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. f(x) = x^x.\n\n2. An elementary antiderivative F(x) is expressible in terms of known algebraic and transcendental functions.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that no such F(x) exists. So perhaps the assumptions are only about the given function and the definition of elementary. But since the problem is about proving non-existence, maybe the only assumption is f(x) = x^x.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's assumptions might include that F(x) is an elementary function (per the problem's wording). But the example given by the user had assumptions on the variable, not the constructed object. In the example, assumptions were on n, not on A(n).\n\nSo here, the function f(x) is given as x^x. So the assumption is f(x) = x^x. The problem is to prove that there is no elementary F(x) with F' = f(x).\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = x^x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no function $F(x)$ expressible in terms of known algebraic and transcendental functions such that $\\frac{d}{dx}F(x) = f(x)$.\n\nBut in the original question, the user also mentions \"known algebraic and transcendental functions\", which could be considered part of the problem statement, but perhaps that's part of the problem's phrasing rather than an assumption. Alternatively, the definition of elementary might be an assumption. However, in mathematical contexts, \"elementary function\" has a standard definition, so maybe that's considered a given and not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the given conditions on the problem's objects. Since the problem is about a specific function x^x, the assumption is that f(x) is x^x. The problem is to prove that no elementary antiderivative exists.\n\nSo I think the correct formatting here is:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x) = x^x$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no function $F(x)$ (expressible in terms of known algebraic and transcendental functions) such that $ \\frac{d}{dx}F(x) = f(x)$.\n\nAlternatively, if the original problem's title is considered part of the problem, but the user wants to extract the problem as per the example. The example included the problem statement with the mathematical expression. So in this case, the problem is to determine with certainty that f(x) has no elementary antiderivative, given f(x) = x^x.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions should include both the function and the definition of elementary. However, the example didn't include definitions as assumptions. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were about n, not about the structure of A(n). Therefore, sticking to the example's style, the assumption here is simply the function given: f(x) = x^x, and the problem is to prove the non-existence of an elementary antiderivative.\n\nYes, that seems to align with the example provided, even though the example might have been incorrectly formatted (since the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added divisibility by 7). Regardless, following the user's example structure, the assumption here would be the given function, and the problem is the rest.",
