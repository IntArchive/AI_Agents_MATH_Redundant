    "Content": "I'm working on the following problem: Let $A$ be the ring of $n \\times n$ matrices over a field $\\mathbb{F}$ . (a) Show that for any subspace $V$ of $\\mathbb{F}^n$ , the set $I_V$ of matrices whose kernel contains $V$ is a left ideal of $A$ . (b) Show that every left ideal of $A$ is principal. I've done part $a)$ , but would like to know if you can prove $b)$ directly from $a)$ . It seems to me that given the left ideal $J$ , it should be the case that if $V$ is the intersection of the kernels of matrices in $J$ , then we should have $J = I_V$ . I can show that $I_V$ is principal, and certainly $J$ is contained in $I_V$ , but I can't show the other direction. I think you can prove $b)$ by considering the subspace $W$ of $\\mathbb{F}^n$ consisting of the rows of elements of $J$ , which is of dimension $k \\leq n$ say, and then showing that $J$ is generated by any matrix whose first $k$ rows are some basis for $W$ and whose final rows are all $0$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "The main result is the following: Let $V$ be a finitely dimensional vector space. Then every left ideal in $\\operatorname{End}(V)$ is of the form $\\mathcal{I}(W) \\colon =\\{T \\in \\operatorname{End}(V) \\mid T = 0 \\textrm{ on } W\\}$ ( $W$ is a subspace of $V$ ) Indeed, let $I$ be a left ideal of $\\operatorname{End}(V)$ and $$W = \\mathcal{Z}(I) \\colon= \\{ w \\in V \\mid T(w) = 0 \\textrm{ for all } T \\in I\\}.$$ Let us show that $I = \\mathcal{I}(W)$ , or, in other words $$I = \\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal{Z}(I)).$$ for every left ideal $I$ . Note that by definition $$\\mathcal{Z}(I) = \\bigcap_{T \\in I} \\ker(T).$$ Since $V$ is a finite dimensional space there exist finitely many $T_1$ , $\\ldots $ , $T_m \\in I$ so that $$W=\\mathcal{Z}(I) = \\bigcap_{i=1}^m\\ker(T_i).$$ Consider the operator $\\tilde T= (T_1, \\ldots, T_m)$ from $V$ to $V^m$ , with kernel $\\bigcap_{i=1}^m\\ker(T_i) = W$ . Let now $S \\in\\operatorname{End}(V)$ that is $0$ on $W$ . It follows (by a standard universality result) that there exists $L:\\operatorname{Im}(\\tilde T) \\to V$ so that $$S = L \\circ \\tilde T.$$ Now $L$ can be extended to the full $V^m$ . We know the form of linear maps from $V^m$ to $V$ . They are given by $L = (L_1, \\ldots , L_m)$ with $L_i \\in\\operatorname{End}(V)$ . Therefore we have $$S = \\sum_{i=1}^m L_i T_i,$$ so $S \\in I$ . ${\\bf Added.}$ Let again $I$ be a left ideal, $W = \\mathcal{Z}(I)$ . We know from the above that $I = \\mathcal{I}(W)$ . From the proof above we see that any family $T_i$ with $\\cap_{i=1}^m\\ker(T_i) = W$ is a system of generators of $I$ . So take $T$ so that $\\ker T= W$ . Then $T \\in I$ and moreover, $T$ generates $I$ . Therefore $I$ is a principal ideal. Obs: Similarly (by duality say) one shows that every right ideal $J$ of $\\operatorname{End}(V)$ is also of the form $$J = \\mathcal{J}(W) = \\{ T \\in \\operatorname{End}(V) \\mid\\operatorname{Im} T \\subset W\\}$$ Moreover, any family $T_i$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^m \\operatorname{Im} T_i = \\sum_{T \\in J} \\operatorname{Im} T$ generates $J$ . Similarly, any right ideal is principal. $\\bf{Added:}$ The universality properties mentioned above: Let $\\phi \\colon M \\to N$ a surjective morphisms ( of groups, modules, sets), $\\phi' \\colon M \\to N'$ be another morphism such that $\\operatorname{ker} \\phi\\subset \\operatorname{ker}\\phi'$ . Then there exists a unique morphism $\\chi \\colon N \\to N'$ such that $\\phi' = \\chi \\circ \\phi$ . Let $\\phi\\colon V \\to W$ , $\\phi\\colon V \\to W'$ linear maps such that $\\operatorname{ker} \\phi\\subset \\operatorname{ker}\\phi'$ . Then there exists a linear map $\\chi \\colon W \\to W'$ ( not necessarily unique) such that $\\phi' = \\chi \\circ \\phi$ . (2. )follows from 1. when we consider the surjective map from $V$ to $\\operatorname{Im} \\phi$ , find a linear map from $\\operatorname{Im} \\phi$ to $W'$ , and extend to a linear map from $W$ to $W'$ ( we use the fact that we are dealing with vector spaces.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about part (b) of the problem, which is to show that every left ideal of the ring A (the ring of n x n matrices over a field F) is principal. They mentioned that they've already done part (a), which establishes that for any subspace V of F^n, the set I_V of matrices whose kernel contains V is a left ideal. Now, they want to see if part (b) can be proven directly using part (a). \n\nFirst, let me recall what a principal left ideal is. In a ring, a principal left ideal is one that is generated by a single element. So, for the ring A, we need to show that every left ideal J can be written as A * M for some matrix M in J. \n\nThe user's approach is to consider the intersection V of the kernels of all matrices in J. Then, they define I_V as the left ideal from part (a) consisting of all matrices whose kernel contains V. They mention that J is contained in I_V, which makes sense because every matrix in J has a kernel containing V (since V is the intersection of all kernels of matrices in J). However, they are stuck on showing the reverse inclusion, that I_V is contained in J, which would establish J = I_V. Then, if I_V is principal, part (b) would follow.\n\nAlternatively, the user suggests another approach: considering the subspace W spanned by the rows of all matrices in J. If W has dimension k, then constructing a matrix whose first k rows are a basis for W and the remaining rows are zero should generate J. But they prefer to use part (a) directly.\n\nLet me try to formalize their first approach. Let J be a left ideal of A. Let V be the intersection of the kernels of all matrices in J. By part (a), I_V is a left ideal. Since every matrix in J has kernel containing V, J is a subset of I_V. The goal is to show that I_V is equal to J. If that's true, then since I_V is principal (as the user claims they can show), J would be principal.\n\nBut how to show I_V is contained in J? Maybe we need to find a matrix M in J such that the kernel of M is exactly V. Then, perhaps I_V is generated by M. Wait, but how to find such an M? If V is the intersection of all kernels of matrices in J, then for any matrix in J, its kernel contains V. But maybe there exists a matrix in J whose kernel is exactly V. If such an M exists, then any matrix in I_V must have kernel containing V, which is the kernel of M. But does that imply that such matrices can be written as a product of some matrix with M? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the correspondence between left ideals and subspaces. Since part (a) links subspaces V to left ideals I_V, perhaps all left ideals are of the form I_V for some V. If that's the case, then part (b) would follow if we can show that each I_V is principal. But how to show that I_V is principal?\n\nTo show I_V is principal, we need to find a single matrix M such that I_V is equal to A*M (the set of all products of matrices in A with M). What would such an M look like? Maybe a matrix whose kernel is exactly V. Then, any matrix in A*M would have kernel containing V, since if Mv = 0, then (AM)v = A(Mv) = A0 = 0. So, A*M is contained in I_V. Conversely, if a matrix B has kernel containing V, can we write B as A*M for some A? Not sure. Maybe need a different approach.\n\nWait, in linear algebra terms, matrices can act as linear transformations. A left ideal in the ring of matrices would correspond to a set of linear transformations closed under addition and left multiplication by any linear transformation. The structure of such ideals is related to subspaces of the vector space. \n\nIn part (a), the left ideal I_V consists of all matrices whose kernel contains V. So, if we have a subspace V, then all matrices that annihilate V form a left ideal. Now, for part (b), the user wants to show that any left ideal is of this form, hence principal. \n\nBut how does being of the form I_V make it principal? Maybe if I_V can be generated by a single matrix. For example, if V is a subspace, perhaps there is a projection matrix onto a complement of V, such that the kernel of this projection is exactly V. Then, this projection matrix might generate I_V. \n\nAlternatively, consider that if V is a subspace of F^n, then we can choose a basis for V and extend it to a basis for F^n. Then, a matrix that projects onto a complement of V would have kernel exactly V. If we take such a projection matrix M, then any matrix whose kernel contains V must factor through this projection. That is, any such matrix can be written as a product of some matrix with M. Hence, I_V = A*M, making it principal.\n\nBut to make this precise, let's think. Suppose V is a subspace, and let M be a matrix whose kernel is exactly V. Then, for any matrix B in I_V, since B's kernel contains V, then B can be written as B = C M for some matrix C. Is that true? Let's see. If M has kernel V, then the image of M is a complementary subspace to V. So, any linear transformation that annihilates V can be written as a composition of a linear transformation after M. Because M maps F^n to its image, and then C can be any linear transformation from the image of M to F^n. So, yes, in that case, B = C M. Therefore, I_V = A*M, so it's principal.\n\nTherefore, if we can show that any left ideal J is equal to I_V for some V, and that I_V is principal, then part (b) is done. But how to connect a general left ideal J to some V? The user suggests taking V as the intersection of the kernels of all matrices in J. Then, J is contained in I_V. If we can show that I_V is contained in J, then J = I_V. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the set of left ideals is in bijection with the set of subspaces V via the maps in part (a). If every left ideal is I_V for some V, and each I_V is principal, then every left ideal is principal. But to confirm this, we need to show that the map from V to I_V is surjective onto the set of left ideals. \n\nGiven any left ideal J, define V as the intersection of kernels of all matrices in J. Then, J is contained in I_V. To show equality, perhaps take a matrix M in I_V and show it must be in J. But how? Maybe by constructing a matrix in J that has kernel exactly V, which would generate I_V. But if such a matrix exists in J, then since J is a left ideal, all multiples of this matrix would be in J, hence I_V is contained in J. Therefore, the critical point is to show that there exists a matrix in J whose kernel is exactly V. \n\nTo construct such a matrix, perhaps take several matrices in J whose kernels intersect to V, and combine them in some way. For example, if we have matrices M1, M2, ..., Mk in J such that the intersection of their kernels is V, then maybe the block diagonal matrix with blocks M1, M2, ..., Mk would have kernel V. But this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, in a matrix ring over a field, maybe we can take a sum of matrices or some other operation to get a matrix with kernel V. \n\nAlternatively, since we are working over a field, which is a division ring, perhaps we can use the fact that the intersection of subspaces can be represented as the kernel of a single matrix. For instance, if V is the intersection of the kernels of several matrices, then we can construct a matrix whose kernel is V by combining these matrices. For example, stacking the matrices vertically (as rows) would create a matrix whose kernel is the intersection. However, in our case, the matrices are n x n, so stacking vertically would not produce an n x n matrix. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Suppose we have a collection of matrices M1, M2, ..., Mk in J. Then, consider the matrix M = M1 + M2 + ... + Mk. But the kernel of M might not be the intersection. Alternatively, consider a matrix M whose rows are linear combinations of rows from these matrices. Hmm, but rows correspond to different things. \n\nAlternatively, in the ring of matrices, left ideals are generated by their row spaces. That is, the set of all matrices whose rows are in the row space of some matrix. Wait, the user mentioned considering the subspace W of F^n consisting of the rows of elements of J. If W has dimension k, then J is generated by any matrix whose first k rows form a basis for W and the rest are zero. This seems related to the row space approach. \n\nSo, if we take W as the subspace spanned by all rows of all matrices in J, then W is a subspace of F^n. Let’s say dim W = k. Then, take a matrix M in J whose first k rows are a basis for W, and the remaining n - k rows are zero. Then, any matrix in J can be obtained by multiplying M on the left by some matrix in A, because the rows of any matrix in J are linear combinations of the rows of M. Thus, J is generated by M, making it principal. \n\nThis approach avoids part (a), and the user wants to use part (a). However, the user is asking if we can use part (a) directly. So, going back to their idea: if we define V as the intersection of kernels of matrices in J, then J is contained in I_V. If we can show I_V is contained in J, then J = I_V, and since I_V is principal, J is principal. \n\nTo show I_V contained in J, take any matrix M in I_V. We need to show M is in J. Since J is a left ideal, it's closed under left multiplication by any matrix. So, if we can write M as a product of some matrix in A and a generator of J, then M would be in J. But we need a generator for J. Wait, but we haven't yet established that J is generated by a single element. \n\nAlternatively, if V is the intersection of the kernels of all matrices in J, then any matrix in I_V has kernel containing V. So, if we can find a matrix in J whose kernel is exactly V, then I_V would be the left ideal generated by that matrix, hence I_V is contained in J because J is a left ideal containing that generator. \n\nBut how to find such a matrix in J with kernel exactly V? Since V is the intersection of all kernels of matrices in J, perhaps by taking a suitable linear combination or product of matrices in J, we can construct a matrix whose kernel is exactly V. \n\nIn finite-dimensional vector spaces, the intersection of kernels can be obtained by taking a set of matrices whose kernels intersect to V, and then constructing a matrix that has those as blocks or something. But in the context of n x n matrices, maybe there's a way to combine them. For example, if we have matrices M1, M2, ..., Mk in J, then the block matrix diag(M1, M2, ..., Mk) might have a kernel related to the intersection, but this is not an n x n matrix. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that in a matrix ring over a field, every left ideal is generated by an idempotent matrix. If we can find an idempotent matrix E such that J = A E, then we are done. The existence of such an idempotent might be related to the subspace V. \n\nAlternatively, consider that for each vector v not in V, there exists a matrix in J such that v is not in the kernel of that matrix. Therefore, the intersection V is precisely the set of vectors annihilated by all matrices in J. To construct a matrix M in J with kernel exactly V, we need to ensure that M kills V and nothing else. \n\nBut how to ensure that? Maybe by taking a basis for V and extending it to a basis for F^n. Suppose {v1, ..., vk} is a basis for V, and {v1, ..., vn} is a basis for F^n. Then, define M to send v1, ..., vk to 0, and v_{k+1}, ..., vn to some linearly independent vectors. However, constructing such an M would require that M is in J. But since J contains all matrices whose kernel contains V, but J is a specific left ideal, we need to ensure M is in J. \n\nWait, no. If J is a left ideal, then for any matrix N in J, left multiplying by any matrix in A gives another element of J. So, if we can find a matrix in J that projects onto a complement of V, then we can generate all matrices that annihilate V. But this might require that such a projection matrix is in J. \n\nAlternatively, since V is the intersection of all kernels of matrices in J, perhaps there exists a finite number of matrices in J whose kernels intersect to V. Then, the product of these matrices (if they commute) would have kernel containing V, but products are in J only if multiplied on the left. Wait, products are not necessarily in J unless J is a two-sided ideal, which it's not. \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe the user's initial approach is better: instead of using part (a), consider the row space. Let me think about that. \n\nIf we let W be the subspace spanned by all rows of all matrices in J, then W is a subspace of F^n. Let’s take a basis for W and form a matrix M where the first k rows are this basis and the rest are zero. Then, any matrix in J has rows in W, so each row can be expressed as a linear combination of the first k rows of M. Therefore, such a matrix can be written as AM, where A is a matrix in A. Hence, J is generated by M, making it principal. \n\nThis approach uses the row space rather than the kernel intersection. The user mentioned this method but wanted to use part (a) instead. However, if the problem allows using either method, perhaps the row space approach is more straightforward. But the user is asking specifically if part (b) can be proven directly from part (a). \n\nSo, going back to part (a): For any subspace V, I_V is a left ideal. Part (b) is to show every left ideal is principal. The user's idea is to take V as the intersection of kernels of matrices in J, then J = I_V, which is principal. To confirm this, we need J = I_V. \n\nTo show J = I_V, we need to show that every matrix with kernel containing V is in J. Since J is a left ideal, if we can find a matrix M in J such that I_V = A*M, then J would contain I_V because J is a left ideal containing M, hence A*M is in J. But since we already have J contained in I_V, equality would follow. \n\nTherefore, the key is to find a generator M of I_V that is in J. If such an M exists, then I_V = A*M ⊆ J, hence J = I_V. So, how to find M in J such that I_V = A*M? \n\nThis reduces to finding a matrix M in J whose kernel is exactly V. Because then any matrix with kernel containing V can be written as a product with M. As earlier, if M has kernel V, then A*M consists of all matrices whose kernel contains V, which is exactly I_V. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to showing that there exists a matrix M in J with kernel V. Since V is the intersection of all kernels of matrices in J, to construct M, we need a matrix in J whose kernel is exactly V. \n\nTo construct such an M, consider that V is the intersection of kernels of all matrices in J. For each vector not in V, there exists at least one matrix in J whose kernel does not contain that vector. Therefore, for each vector v not in V, there exists M_v in J such that M_v v ≠ 0. \n\nSince F^n is finite-dimensional, we can take a basis for a complement of V. Suppose V has dimension k, so a complement has dimension n - k. Let’s take a basis {e_1, ..., e_{n-k}} for this complement. For each e_i, there exists a matrix M_i in J such that M_i e_i ≠ 0. \n\nNow, consider constructing a matrix M in J that acts non-trivially on each e_i. For example, take M = M_1 + ... + M_{n-k}. However, the kernel of M might not be exactly V, because adding matrices can create new vectors in the kernel. \n\nAlternatively, arrange the M_i in a block diagonal matrix. But since we're working with n x n matrices, this might not be straightforward. Another idea: use the fact that the ring of matrices is simple (no two-sided ideals except 0 and the whole ring), but we're dealing with left ideals here. \n\nAlternatively, use the fact that over a field, every left ideal is generated by a single idempotent element. So, there exists an idempotent matrix E (E^2 = E) such that J = A*E. Then, E would have kernel V, and I_V = A*E. \n\nBut how to construct E? If we can find a projection onto a complement of V, then E would be such a projection, and its kernel would be V. But we need E to be in J. \n\nSince V is the intersection of kernels of all matrices in J, any matrix in J must annihilate V. A projection onto a complement of V would have kernel exactly V, so if such a projection is in J, then we're done. But how to ensure that such a projection exists in J?\n\nPerhaps by taking linear combinations of elements of J to construct a projection. For example, since J is a left ideal, it's closed under addition and left multiplication. If we can find matrices in J whose combined action projects onto a complement of V, then their sum or product (if defined) might give the desired projection.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the intersection V being the common kernel, and the left ideal J consists of all matrices that kill V. The quotient space F^n / V is a vector space, and matrices in J induce linear maps from F^n to F^n that factor through F^n / V. Thus, J can be identified with Hom(F^n, F^n) where each map factors through F^n / V. The ring A is isomorphic to End(F^n), and Hom(F^n, F^n / V) is a left ideal. \n\nBut in this identification, the left ideal would correspond to all linear maps whose kernel contains V. To generate this left ideal with a single element, we need a map that projects onto a complement of V. The projection map would generate all such maps because any map killing V can be written as a composition with the projection. Hence, the projection matrix would be the generator, making the ideal principal.\n\nTherefore, if such a projection matrix exists in J, then J is equal to I_V and is principal. The challenge is to show that this projection matrix is indeed in J. \n\nSince J contains all matrices that kill V, and the projection matrix kills V, it should be in J. Wait, but the projection matrix is a specific matrix that kills V. However, unless the projection matrix is constructed from elements of J, we can't be sure it's in J. \n\nBut if we can construct the projection matrix using elements of J, then it would be in J. Given that V is the intersection of kernels of matrices in J, and for each vector not in V, there's a matrix in J that doesn't kill it, perhaps we can combine these matrices to build a projection.\n\nFor example, take a basis {v_1, ..., v_k} for V and extend it to a basis {v_1, ..., v_n} for F^n. For each i from k+1 to n, there exists a matrix M_i in J such that M_i v_i ≠ 0. We can then adjust these matrices so that they project onto some subspace complementary to V.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Maybe the answer lies in recognizing that in the ring of matrices over a field, all left ideals are principal, and this follows from the correspondence with subspaces and the ability to generate them via a single matrix (like a projection). Therefore, using part (a), where each I_V is a left ideal, and realizing that every left ideal is of the form I_V, which is principal, completes the proof.\n\nTo summarize the assumptions and problem structure based on the user's example:\n\nAssumption: \n- A is the ring of n x n matrices over a field F.\n- V is a subspace of F^n.\n- I_V is the set of matrices whose kernel contains V.\n- J is a left ideal of A.\n- V is the intersection of the kernels of all matrices in J.\n- I_V is a left ideal (from part a).\n\nProblem:\nShow that every left ideal J of A is principal by demonstrating J = I_V and I_V is principal.",
