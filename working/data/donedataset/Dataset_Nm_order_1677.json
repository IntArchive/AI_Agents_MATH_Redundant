    "Content": "Recently I was reading Bruce Berndt and George Andrews' book \"Ramanujan's lost notebook\". Ramanujan showed how to calculate integrals of the form $\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(\\pi wx^2)}{\\cosh(\\pi x)}dx\n$ when $w\\in\\mathbb Q$. Inspired by Ramanujan's work I decided to try to compute numerically various similar looking integrals and by coincidence it turned out that $\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(2\\pi x^2)}{\\cosh^2(\\pi x)}dx=0.250000000000000000...\n$ It looks like this integral is $\\frac 14$, but I have no clue how to prove it. Question: How to prove that $$ \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(2\\pi x^2)}{\\cosh^2(\\pi x)}dx=\\frac 14 ?$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm busy today so some arguments have to be more rigorous Denote the integral in question by $I$ (which by symmetry can be extended to the whole real line) $$\nI=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\cos(2\\pi x^2)}{\\cosh^2(\\pi x)}\n$$ Now consider the complex valued function $$\nf(z)=\\frac{e^{i 2 \\pi z^2}}{\\sinh(4 \\pi z)\\cosh(\\pi z)^2}\n$$ then \n$$f(x\\pm i)=\\frac{ e^{i 2 \\pi x^2\\mp 4 \\pi x}}{\\sinh(4 \\pi z)\\cosh(\\pi z)^2}$$ Furthermore integrating $f(z)$ around a rectangle $(-i -\\infty,i -\\infty,i +\\infty,-i +\\infty)$ in counterclockwise direction yields $$\n\\oint_C f(z)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}f(x+i)-\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}f(x-i)=2\\pi i \\sum\\text{Res}(f(z),z\\in C )\n$$ but $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}f(x+i)-f(x-i)=2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\frac{e^{i 2 \\pi x^2}}{\\cosh(\\pi x)^2}$. The real part of this integral is just four times the  integral we are looking for, $I$. $$\n4 I=2\\Re \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\frac{e^{i 2 \\pi x^2}}{\\cosh(\\pi x)^2}=\\Re\\left[2 i\\pi \\sum_{\\sigma=\\pm}\\text{Res}(f(z),z=\\sigma\\frac{i}{2})\\right]\n$$ since it turns out that only the residues at $z=\\pm \\frac{i}{2}$ a) have finite imaginary part and b) don't cancel so they are the only contributions to the real part of the above expression, given by $\\text{Res}(f(z)=z=\\pm \\frac{i}{2})=-\\frac{2+i \\pi}{4\\pi^2}$. Putting everything together we obtain $$\nI=\\frac{1}{4}\\Re\\left[-2 \\pi i \\left(\\frac{2+i\\pi}{4 \\pi^2}+\\frac{2+i\\pi}{4 \\pi^2}\\right)\\right]=\\frac{1}{4}\n$$ QED Note that with some more (straightforward) work, also the integral with $\\sin(2\\pi x^2)$ in the numerator can be extracted from the above calculation by taking imaginary parts. $$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin(2\\pi x^2)}{\\cosh^2(\\pi x)}=\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided includes listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the problem from Math Stack Exchange: the integral to prove is ∫₀^∞ [cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx)] dx = 1/4. The original question mentions Ramanujan's work on similar integrals involving cos(π w x²)/cosh(π x) dx with w rational. The user here computed this specific integral numerically and observed it's 1/4, but needs a proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to infinity. The integrand is cos(2πx²) divided by cosh squared of πx. The problem is to prove the integral equals 1/4.\n\nAssumptions would be the conditions under which the integral is evaluated. The original integral's limits are from 0 to infinity. The integrand involves cos(2πx²) and cosh²(πx). However, in the example given, assumptions were about the variable (n being integer, etc.). Here, the integral's variables and functions are part of the problem statement. Wait, the example had assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this integral problem, there might not be explicit assumptions like that. Wait, the user's instruction says to list all assumptions of the problem. If the problem doesn't state any explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup, maybe the assumptions are about the functions involved? For instance, the integrand is defined for x ≥ 0, and the integral converges.\n\nBut the example given had the problem stating that n is an integer, which was an assumption. In this case, the problem is to compute the integral as given. Are there any implicit assumptions here? The integrand is well-behaved: cosh squared in the denominator is always positive, so no division by zero. The integral converges because as x approaches infinity, cosh²(πx) grows exponentially, and the numerator oscillates but is bounded, so the integrand decays sufficiently. So maybe the assumptions are that the integral converges? But the problem doesn't state that; it's part of what needs to be considered when evaluating the integral.\n\nWait, the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's given conditions. The original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So in this integral problem, the assumptions would be the conditions under which the integral is posed. But the integral is presented as is. The problem is to compute it, so the assumptions might be the domain of integration (from 0 to infinity), and perhaps that the integrand is as given.\n\nBut in the example, they split into separate lines each assumption. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx),\nThe integral converges.\n\nBut the problem statement already includes the integral from 0 to infinity of that integrand. However, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So maybe here, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe domain of integration is [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is defined as cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx).\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since the problem is to evaluate the integral, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Since there are no variables like n here, but rather the integral is definite, maybe the assumptions are that the integral exists (converges). However, the user's example included even the problem's own variables. Wait, in the example, the problem was about A(n) for every integer n, and the assumption listed was n is an integer, even though the problem statement already says \"for every integer n\".\n\nHmm, maybe the user wants to list any conditions or constraints given in the problem. In this case, the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is specified. Since the problem is to prove the value, the assumptions would be the setup: integrating from 0 to infinity, the integrand is as given. But perhaps each part is a separate assumption. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\nThe upper limit of integration is ∞,\nThe numerator of the integrand is cos(2πx²),\nThe denominator of the integrand is cosh²(πx).\n\nBut maybe that's too granular. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the main assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand's form. But perhaps more abstractly:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable,\nThe integral is over x from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx).\n\nBut I need to check the example again. In the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\". Then, in the formatted problem, the assumption was listed as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe original example problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be an error. However, in the example provided by the user, perhaps they made a mistake. But since the user provided that example as part of the instructions, I should follow their format.\n\nBut in their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo. Maybe the original problem was supposed to have a condition that n is divisible by 7? Otherwise, the formatted problem's assumptions conflict with the original problem's statement.\n\nAssuming that the example is correct, the user is instructing to list all assumptions from the problem. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is \"n is an integer\". If the problem had said \"for n divisible by 7\", then that would be another assumption. However, in the example, the formatted problem's assumptions include \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not be part of the original problem. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example was different? Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem in example: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\".\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. If the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be \"n is an integer\". The conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. But 91 is 7*13. If the problem requires n to be divisible by 7, that's an added condition. But the original problem's statement says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But since that's the example given, perhaps the instruction is to list all conditions required for the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated but necessary for the proof. Hmm, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake and the original problem was \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", which would make the assumptions in the formatted problem correct. Since I need to follow the user's example, even if there's a mistake, I should replicate the structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is given as ∫₀^∞ [cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx)] dx = 1/4. The question is to prove this. The original problem mentions that the user was inspired by Ramanujan's integrals of the form ∫₀^∞ [cos(π w x²)/cosh(π x)] dx for rational w. But the current integral has cos(2πx²) and cosh squared in the denominator. The problem is to prove it's 1/4.\n\nIn terms of assumptions, the integral is from 0 to infinity, the integrand is as specified. There are no variables here; it's a definite integral. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integrand is cos(2πx²) divided by cosh²(πx).\n- The integral converges.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed as separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the integral's limits, the integrand's form, and convergence might be considered separate assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the main assumption is that the integral exists (converges), which is necessary to state the problem. But perhaps the user wants the structure to include the components of the problem, like the limits and integrand.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\nThe upper limit of integration is ∞,\nThe integrand is cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx).\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the user considered that the problem's variables and their conditions. Here, x is a real variable, but that's implicit. The integral is over x from 0 to infinity. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nThe integral is computed over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe numerator of the integrand is cos(2πx²),\nThe denominator of the integrand is cosh²(πx).\n\nBut I think the user's example didn't break down the integrand into numerator and denominator but listed the entire expression. Alternatively, in the example, the problem was about A(n) = 5^n(...) -6^n(...), and the assumption was about n being an integer. So maybe here, the integral expression is part of the problem statement, and the assumptions are about the variables involved. But since there's no variable parameter here (like n), just the variable of integration x, which is a dummy variable, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is over x from 0 to ∞,\n- The integrand is cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx).\n\nBut maybe the convergence is an implicit assumption. However, in the example, the assumption wasn't about convergence but about n being an integer. So perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are just the integral's limits and the integrand's form.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx).\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ [cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx)] dx = 1/4.\n\nWait, but the example in the user's instruction included multiple assumptions, each on a separate line. Here, the integral's limits and integrand can be considered separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\nThe upper limit of integration is ∞,\nThe integrand is cos(2πx²) divided by cosh²(πx).\n\nBut perhaps the first two can be combined into \"The integral is over the interval [0, ∞)\". So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement already includes the integral, so the assumptions are the components necessary for the problem. In the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Here, since there are no variables like n, the assumptions are just the integral's setup. But to adhere to the example's structure, perhaps list each component as a separate assumption.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. The integral's limits are two separate properties (lower and upper), and the integrand is another. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of the integral is 0,\nThe upper limit of the integral is ∞,\nThe integrand is cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the value of the integral is 1/4.\n\nBut in the example, the problem restates the expression. Maybe the problem part should include the integral expression. The original problem's example had the problem part as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\". So here, the problem part should be \"Prove that ∫₀^∞ [cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx)] dx = 1/4.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is cos(2πx²)/cosh²(πx).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$ \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(2\\pi x^2)}{\\cosh^2(\\pi x)}dx=\\frac 14.$$\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is given by \\(\\frac{\\cos(2\\pi x^2)}{\\cosh^2(\\pi x)}\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nAlternatively, following the example's syntax:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by $7$.\" Each on a separate line. So here, each assumption should be a separate line, each addressing one property. The integral's domain and the integrand.\n\nBut the integral is from 0 to infinity, which is a single condition on the integral's limits. The integrand is another condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{\\cos(2\\pi x^2)}{\\cosh^2(\\pi x)}\\).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$ \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(2\\pi x^2)}{\\cosh^2(\\pi x)}dx=\\frac 14.$$\n\nYes, this seems correct. The assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand's expression. Each is a separate line. The problem is to prove the integral equals 1/4.",
