    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is about proving an integral equation where the integral from a to b of 1 over the square root of the absolute value of f(x) dx equals the integral from c to d of the same function. The user mentions that a > b > c > d, which is a bit confusing because usually, we list variables in increasing order. Wait, the user wrote a > b > c > d, so that means a is the largest, followed by b, then c, then d. But in standard interval notation for integrals, we have the limits from lower to upper, so if a is the largest, then the integral from a to b would actually be going from a higher value to a lower one. But the integral from a higher limit to a lower limit is the negative of the integral from lower to higher. However, since the integrand includes an absolute value, maybe that doesn't matter? Hmm, but the problem statement just writes the integral from a to b, so maybe they are considering a and b as the limits regardless of order, but since the integrand has absolute value, the sign doesn't matter. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote \"let a > b > c > d\", which is a bit odd. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo here. Normally, when integrating over real intervals, the upper limit is greater than the lower limit. But here, the user says a > b > c > d. So if a is the largest, then integrating from a to b would be integrating from a higher number to a lower number. But since the integrand is 1 over sqrt(|f(x)|), which is positive, the integral would just be the negative of the integral from b to a. However, the problem states that the integral from a to b equals the integral from c to d. Since a > b and c > d, then both integrals are from higher to lower limits. But maybe the absolute value in the integrand makes it symmetric? Wait, f(x) is given as (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d). Since a > b > c > d, then the roots are ordered as a, b, c, d from largest to smallest. So if we consider x between a and b, then x is between a and b, which are the two largest roots. Then (x - a) would be negative (since x < a), (x - b) would be negative (since x < b, but a > b, so x is between a and b? Wait, no. If a > b and x is between a and b, that would mean a > x > b. Wait, but if a > b, then the interval from a to b is going from a higher value to a lower one, and x is between b and a. So (x - a) is negative (since x < a), and (x - b) is positive (since x > b). Wait, no: if a > b and x is between a and b, meaning x is less than a and greater than b. So, x is in (b, a). Then (x - a) is negative, (x - b) is positive. Similarly, (x - c) and (x - d) would be positive since x > b > c > d, so x > c and x > d. Therefore, f(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d) would be (negative)(positive)(positive)(positive) = negative. Therefore, |f(x)| = |(x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d)| = |negative| = positive. So the integrand is real and positive.\n\nSimilarly, when integrating from c to d, since c > d, the interval is from higher to lower. In this interval, x is between d and c. So (x - a) is negative (x < a), (x - b) is negative (x < b), (x - c) is negative (x < c), and (x - d) is positive (x > d). So f(x) is (negative)(negative)(negative)(positive) = positive. Then |f(x)| is positive. So the integrand is again real and positive.\n\nThe problem is to show that these two integrals, from a to b and from c to d, are equal. The user tried a substitution where u = x + something, and mentions if a + d = b + c, then substituting y = a + d - x would work. But in the general case, maybe there's a substitution that can symmetrize the integral.\n\nLooking at the problem, the key seems to be the symmetry in the polynomial f(x). Since it's a quartic polynomial with roots at a, b, c, d ordered as a > b > c > d. Maybe there's a substitution that maps the interval [a, b] to [c, d] in a way that preserves the structure of f(x). For example, a linear substitution that reflects or translates the interval.\n\nThe user's attempt mentions letting u = x + something, and if a + d = b + c, then substitution y = a + d - x would work. So if a + d = b + c, then y = a + d - x would map x = a to y = a + d - a = d, and x = b to y = a + d - b. But since a + d = b + c, then substituting, a + d - b = c. So x = b maps to y = c. Therefore, the substitution y = a + d - x maps [a, b] to [d, c], but since the integral is from a to b, which in terms of substitution would become from d to c. However, the problem states the integral from c to d. But since integrating from d to c is the negative of integrating from c to d, but the absolute value would make them equal. Wait, but in the problem, both integrals are from higher limit to lower limit (a to b and c to d), so perhaps under substitution, the limits would invert, but due to absolute value, the integral remains the same.\n\nBut the user's problem doesn't assume a + d = b + c, so maybe in the general case, this substitution works? Wait, the user says \"maybe let u = x + ( ) such when x = a, b then u = c, d\". So they are trying to find a substitution that linearly maps [a, b] to [c, d]. If such a substitution exists, then changing variables might equate the integrals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry in the polynomial when reflected over some axis. For example, if we make a substitution like y = a + d - x or y = b + c - x, then f(y) might relate to f(x). Let's explore this.\n\nSuppose we let y = a + d - x. Then when x = a, y = d, and when x = b, y = a + d - b. If a + d - b = c, then this maps x = b to y = c. So for this substitution to map [a, b] to [d, c], we need a + d - b = c, which is equivalent to a + d = b + c. So this substitution works only if a + d = b + c, which is a condition the problem does not state. The original problem just states a > b > c > d, without any relation between a, b, c, d. However, the user in their attempt mentions that if a + d = b + c, then the substitution works, but for other cases, they can't figure it out.\n\nBut the problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange does not include the condition a + d = b + c. The user is trying to ask how to prove the equality of the integrals without that condition. However, the problem might actually require that condition. Wait, but the original problem's title says \"How prove this integral equation...\" and the user is showing their attempt, which only works if a + d = b + c, but the problem as stated doesn't have that condition. Therefore, there might be missing conditions in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem as stated does hold for any a > b > c > d, and the substitution is more clever.\n\nWait, let's think again. The polynomial is f(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d). If we make a substitution that maps the interval [a, b] to [c, d], perhaps a linear substitution. Let’s suppose that there's a linear transformation y = m x + k that maps a to c and b to d. But for such a linear substitution, we would need the slope m = (d - c)/(b - a), and then k would adjust accordingly. However, applying such a substitution might complicate the expression for f(x).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a Möbius transformation or another kind of symmetry. Alternatively, considering the polynomial f(x) as symmetric around some axis. If the roots are symmetric around a central point, then reflection might work. But the problem does not state that the roots are symmetric. Wait, but in the case where a + d = b + c, the roots are symmetric with respect to the midpoint (a + d)/2 = (b + c)/2. So if that's the case, then substituting y = (a + d) - x would map a to d and b to c, hence flipping the interval [a, b] to [d, c], which is the same as [c, d] if we reverse the limits. But since the integral's limits are from a to b (which is higher to lower) and c to d (also higher to lower), then under substitution y = (a + d) - x, the integral from a to b becomes integral from d to c, which is the same as integral from c to d because of the absolute value. So in that case, the integral would be equal.\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user does not mention the condition a + d = b + c. So is the problem missing that condition? Because otherwise, if the roots are arbitrary, the integrals might not be equal. For example, take specific values where a + d ≠ b + c. Let's test with numbers. Suppose a = 4, b = 3, c = 2, d = 1. Then a > b > c > d. Here, a + d = 5, b + c = 5, so it satisfies a + d = b + c. So the substitution y = 5 - x would map x=4 to y=1, x=3 to y=2. Then the integral from 4 to 3 of 1/sqrt(|f(x)|) dx would equal the integral from 1 to 2 of 1/sqrt(|f(y)|) dy, which is the same as the integral from 2 to 1 (changing limits) but with absolute value, it becomes the same as integral from 1 to 2. However, in this case, since f(y) when y = 5 - x would be (5 - x -4)(5 - x -3)(5 - x -2)(5 - x -1) = (1 - x)(2 - x)(3 - x)(4 - x) = (x -1)(x -2)(x -3)(x -4) with signs, but absolute value would make it same as f(x). Wait, maybe in this symmetric case, f(y) = f(5 - x) = (5 - x -4)(5 - x -3)(5 - x -2)(5 - x -1) = (1 - x)(2 - x)(3 - x)(4 - x) = (-1)^4(x -1)(x -2)(x -3)(x -4) = f(x) where the roots are 1,2,3,4. Wait, but in the original problem, the roots are a,b,c,d which are 4,3,2,1. So f(x) = (x-4)(x-3)(x-2)(x-1). Then f(5 - x) = (5 - x -4)(5 - x -3)(5 - x -2)(5 - x -1) = (1 - x)(2 - x)(3 - x)(4 - x) = (x -1)(x -2)(x -3)(x -4) with each term multiplied by (-1). So f(5 - x) = (x -1)(x -2)(x -3)(x -4) = same as f(x) but ordered. Wait, since multiplication is commutative, f(5 - x) = f(x). So |f(5 - x)| = |f(x)|. Therefore, substitution y = 5 - x would leave the integrand the same. Then integral from x=4 to x=3 of 1/sqrt(|f(x)|) dx becomes integral from y=1 to y=2 of 1/sqrt(|f(5 - y)|) * (-dy), but since we swap the limits, it becomes integral from 1 to 2 of 1/sqrt(|f(y)|) dy. But in the problem statement, the other integral is from c to d, which in this case is c=2, d=1. So integral from 2 to 1 of 1/sqrt(|f(x)|) dx is the same as integral from 1 to 2, which matches. So in this symmetric case, the integrals are equal.\n\nBut if the roots are not symmetric, then this substitution would not work. For example, take a=5, b=3, c=2, d=1. So a + d = 6, b + c = 5. Then a + d ≠ b + c. Then substitution y = 6 - x would map x=5 to y=1, x=3 to y=3. Then the integral from 5 to 3 would map to integral from 1 to 3, but the other integral is from c=2 to d=1. So these intervals don't match. Therefore, in this case, the integrals might not be equal. Therefore, the problem as stated might require the condition a + d = b + c, which is not mentioned. However, the original problem on Math Stack Exchange does not state this condition. The user's question includes \"let a > b > c > d\", and f(x) as the product. The problem is to show the equality of the integrals. The user's try assumes that maybe a + d = b + c, but they are unsure.\n\nThis suggests that either the problem has a missing condition, or there is a different approach that doesn't require the symmetry. But if the problem holds without the symmetry condition, then it's a general result. To verify, maybe we can check another example where a + d ≠ b + c.\n\nTake a=4, b=3, c=1, d=0. Then a + d =4, b + c=4. So 4=4, which satisfies a + d = b + c. So this is symmetric. Then the integrals would be equal. If we take a=5, b=3, c=2, d=1, where a + d =6 and b + c=5, not equal. Compute the integrals numerically. Let's define f(x) = (x -5)(x -3)(x -2)(x -1). Then compute the integral from 5 to 3 of 1/sqrt(|f(x)|) dx and from 2 to1 of the same. But integrating such functions might be difficult, but maybe approximate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem inherently requires the condition a + d = b + c. Since the user's example in the try worked under that condition, but the problem as stated doesn't specify. Therefore, the original problem might have a missing condition. However, the user presented the problem as stated, so we need to structure it according to the given information, filtering out unrelated parts.\n\nLooking back at the original question: \"let a > b > c > d, and f(x) = (x -a)(x -b)(x -c)(x -d). Show that the integral from a to b of 1/sqrt(|f(x)|) dx equals the integral from c to d of the same.\"\n\nThe problem as stated does not include the condition a + d = b + c. The user's try considered that if a + d = b + c, then substitution works, but otherwise not. Therefore, the problem might have a missing assumption. But since the user is asking how to prove it, and they didn't mention that condition, perhaps the actual assumption is that a + d = b + c. But in the problem statement, the user did not state that. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, but given the polynomial f(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d), the integral from a to b and from c to d can be transformed via substitution even without the symmetry. Wait, perhaps there's a substitution that inverts the order of the roots. For example, substituting y = (a + d) - x or something else.\n\nAlternatively, considering the function f(x) is a quartic with four real roots, and the integrals are over the intervals where the function is negative (between a and b) and positive (between c and d). Wait, no, between a and b, as previously established, f(x) is negative, and between c and d, f(x) is positive (since x is less than c but greater than d, so (x - a), (x - b), (x - c) are negative, and (x - d) is positive, so product is negative*(negative)*(negative)*(positive) = negative*positive = negative? Wait, between c and d, x is in (d, c). So x - a <0, x - b <0, x - c <0 (since x < c), x - d >0 (since x > d). Therefore, f(x) = (-)(-)(-)(+) = (-)(+) = -positive. So |f(x)| = positive in both intervals. So the integrand is positive in both cases.\n\nBut why would those two integrals be equal? Perhaps there is a symmetry in the polynomial when considering reciprocal transformations or other substitutions. Alternatively, considering the elliptic integrals, since the integral of 1 over sqrt(quartic) is an elliptic integral, and under certain conditions, these can be equal. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through contour integration or some reflection, but that's complex.\n\nBut returning to the problem structuring. The user's original problem statement is:\n\n\"let a > b > c > d, and\n$$f(x)=(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d)$$\nshow that\n$$\\int_{a}^{b}\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{|f(x)|}}dx=\\int_{c}^{d}\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{|f(x)|}}dx$$\"\n\nThe user's try mentions assuming a + d = b + c, but that's not in the original problem. However, perhaps the correct assumption for the problem to hold is that a + d = b + c, which makes the polynomial symmetric. Therefore, the problem as stated by the user might be missing that condition. But since the user wrote \"let a > b > c > d\", without additional conditions, perhaps the correct structuring is to note that in the problem statement, but the original problem might actually require the assumption a + d = b + c. But how to know?\n\nWait, looking at the example given by the user in the initial instruction: the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user's formatted version included that assumption even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So the example added an assumption. Therefore, maybe here, the assistant is supposed to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with necessary assumptions. But in the original problem on Math Stack Exchange, the user did not state any assumptions beyond a > b > c > d and f(x) defined as such. Therefore, perhaps the correct structuring is to list the assumptions as given, unless there's a missing implicit assumption.\n\nBut in the problem as stated, if the equality holds without any further assumptions, then the assumptions are just a > b > c > d. However, from the analysis above, the equality might not hold unless a + d = b + c. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a missing assumption, which the user didn't state, but their try indicates that it's needed. Therefore, to correctly structure the problem, the assumption should include a + d = b + c.\n\nBut the original problem as presented by the user does not state that assumption. Therefore, there's a contradiction. The user might have made a mistake in omitting the assumption. As a professor structuring the problem, one has to decide whether to include the assumption based on the problem's requirements. Since the problem is to show the equality, which likely requires the symmetry condition, then the assumption a + d = b + c should be included. However, the user wrote \"let a > b > c > d\", and then defined f(x). Therefore, in the absence of explicit information, the assistant should structure the problem as given, but perhaps the assumption a + d = b + c is necessary and implicit.\n\nBut since the user's try mentions that if a + d = b + c, then the substitution works, but for other cases, they can't, it's possible that the problem as intended includes that assumption, but the user forgot to mention it. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, we need to infer the assumption a + d = b + c.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should include the assumption a + d = b + c.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c, d are real numbers,\n- a > b > c > d,\n- a + d = b + c.\n\nAnd the problem is to show the equality of the integrals.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement by the user says \"let a > b > c > d\", and defines f(x). The user's try introduces the condition a + d = b + c, but the problem as stated does not. So if we strictly follow the user's original problem, the assumptions are just a > b > c > d. But the problem might not hold under those conditions. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake, but the assistant's job is to structure the problem as presented, filtering out unrelated information.\n\nThe original question's title is \"How prove this integral equation...\", and the problem states the equality without additional conditions. The user's try mentions a possible substitution under a + d = b + c, but the problem doesn't state that. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is that the problem as stated is missing the assumption a + d = b + c, and thus the structured problem should include that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem does hold without that condition, but that seems unlikely. Given the user's try, it's probable that the problem requires the condition a + d = b + c, which was accidentally omitted.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should include that assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. a, b, c, d are real numbers,\n2. a > b > c > d,\n3. a + d = b + c.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\int_{a}^{b}\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{|f(x)|}}dx=\\int_{c}^{d}\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{|f(x)|}}dx$$ where $$f(x)=(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d)$$.\n\nBut since the original problem did not mention the third assumption, but the user's try did, there's ambiguity. However, as a professor structuring the problem, to make the problem solvable, the assumption a + d = b + c is necessary. Therefore, including that.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to be presented as the user wrote, without that assumption, then the formatted problem would only have a > b > c > d. But given the mathematical inconsistency, it's better to include the missing assumption.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should include the assumption a + d = b + c.",
