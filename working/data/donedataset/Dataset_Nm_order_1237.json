    "Content": "I'm asked to used induction to prove Bernoulli's Inequality: If $1+x>0$, then $(1+x)^n\\geq 1+nx$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. This what I have so far: Let $n=1$. Then $1+x\\geq 1+x$. This is true. Now assume that the proposed inequality holds for some arbitrary $k$, namely that\n$$1+x>0\\implies (1+x)^k\\geq 1+kx,~\\forall~k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{1\\}$$\nis true. We want to show that the proposed inequality holds for $k+1$. Thus multiplication of $(1+x)$ on each side of the above inequality produces the following result:\n$$(1+x)(1+x)^k\\geq (1+kx)(1+x)\\implies (1+x)^{k+1}\\geq 1+x+kx+kx^2\\cdots\\cdots\\cdots$$ I'm not sure where to go from here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You're almost done. $(1+x)^{k+1}\\geq (1+kx)(1+x)=1+kx^2+(k+1)x\\geq1+(k+1)x$ since $kx^2\\geq 0$. Also in your assumption, \"$1+x>0\\implies (1+x)^k\\geq 1+kx,~\\forall~k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{1\\}$\", you shouldn't write $\\forall~k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{1\\}$. Because if you assume this is true for all $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$, then you've already assumed it is true for $k+1$. Also, you shouldn't let $k\\ne 1$, since then your argument doesn't allow you to conclude $P(1) \\implies P(2)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Proof by induction of Bernoulli's inequality: (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + nx\". The user is asking about using induction to prove Bernoulli's Inequality. The problem statement given in the question is: If 1 + x > 0, then (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + nx for all n ∈ ℕ. \n\nThe user then goes through their attempt. They start with the base case n=1, which checks out as 1 + x ≥ 1 + x. Then they assume it's true for some arbitrary k, leading to the inductive step. They multiply both sides by (1 + x) to get (1 + x)^{k+1} ≥ (1 + kx)(1 + x). Expanding the right side gives 1 + x + kx + kx², which simplifies to 1 + (k + 1)x + kx². The user is stuck here, not sure how to proceed.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement following the example provided. The example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst, looking at the problem statement: The inequality (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + nx holds if 1 + x > 0, for all n ∈ ℕ. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The variable x satisfies 1 + x > 0. This is a condition on x.\n2. The exponent n is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ). This is a condition on n.\n3. The problem is to prove the inequality using mathematical induction. The method is specified, so that's part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, the assumptions would be about x and n. So:\n\nAssumption 1: 1 + x > 0 (applies to x)\nAssumption 2: n is a natural number (applies to n)\n\nThe problem is to prove by induction that (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + nx.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user mentions induction, so the problem statement in the formatted version should include that the proof must use induction. However, in the example given, the problem was just to prove the divisibility, and the assumption included a specific condition (n divisible by 7). Here, the method (induction) is part of the problem instruction. So how to handle that?\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was restated.\n\nIn this case, the original problem says \"Prove by induction Bernoulli's inequality...\". So the method (induction) is part of the problem statement.\n\nBut in the example, the method (if any) was not part of the assumption. So perhaps in this case, the problem should state \"Prove by induction that...\" as part of the problem line.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- 1 + x > 0 (pertaining to x)\n- n is a natural number (pertaining to n)\n\nAnd the problem is: Prove by induction that (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + nx.\n\nBut wait, the user's problem as stated in their question is: \"Prove Bernoulli's Inequality: If 1 + x > 0, then (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + nx for all n ∈ ℕ.\" The induction part is their approach. But the actual problem as posed might not specify induction, but the user is asking for help with their induction proof.\n\nWait, the original title is \"Proof by induction of Bernoulli's inequality...\" and the question says, \"I'm asked to used induction to prove Bernoulli's Inequality...\" So the actual problem assigned to them is to use induction. Therefore, the problem statement here includes the requirement to use induction.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. 1 + x > 0 (applies to x)\n2. n is a natural number (applies to n)\n\nThe problem is: Prove by induction that (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + nx.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that induction is the method is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the problem line includes \"Prove by induction...\", and the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem: 1 + x > 0, and n ∈ ℕ.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The problem requires using induction, so it's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The assumptions are the given conditions.\n\nSo, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\n1 + x > 0,\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve by induction that (1 + x)^n ≥ 1 + nx.\n\nChecking the example again: In the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Similarly, here the conditions are 1 + x > 0 and n ∈ ℕ. The method (induction) is part of the problem instruction.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be structured as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n1 + x > 0,\nn is a natural number.\nProblem: \nProve by induction that $$(1 + x)^n \\geq 1 + nx$$.\n###",
