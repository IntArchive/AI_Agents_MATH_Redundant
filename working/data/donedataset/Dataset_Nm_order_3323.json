    "Content": "I want to understand why the following function, the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric linear operator, is continuous and Gâteaux differentiable . \\begin{equation*}\n\\lambda(V)=\\sup_{f \\in \\ell^2(I):\\ \\rVert f \\lVert_2} \\langle (A+V)f, f \\rangle, \\qquad V \\in \\ell^2(I)\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $I$ is a finite index set (subset of $\\mathbb Z^d$ in fact) $A: \\ell^2(I) \\rightarrow \\ell^2(I)$ is a symmetric linear operator that is nonnegative outside its diagonal, so $-A$ is positive definite $V \\in \\ell^2(I)$ multiplies like the diagonal matrix $\\mathrm{diag}(V_1, \\dots, V_n)$. I encountered this statement in a probability theory proof where it simply states that this follows easily from the Perron-Frobenius theorem and basic linear algebra. So we should have (1) \\begin{equation*}\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\sup_{\\lVert f \\rVert_2=1} \\langle(A+V_n)f,f\\rangle\n=\\sup_{\\lVert f \\rVert_2=1} \\langle(Af,f\\rangle, \\qquad \\mathrm{\\ where\\ } V_n \\rightarrow 0 \\mathrm{\\ pointwise}\n\\end{equation*} and the existence of (2)\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim_{t \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{1}{t} \\left( \\lambda(V+hg)-\\lambda(V) \\right)\n=\\lim_{t \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{1}{t} \\left( \\sup_{\\lVert f \\rVert_2=1} \\langle(A+V+hg)f,f\\rangle - \\sup_{\\lVert f \\rVert_2=1} \\langle(A+V)f,f\\rangle \\right).\n\\end{equation*} In (1) the problem is that it's not obvious to me that we may swap the limit and the supremum and I don't see any good reason for this to be true. For (2) I'm simply puzzled. The Perron-Frobenius theorem says that the largest eigenvalue of $A+V$ is simple and that it has a positive eigenfunction. But I don't see how to conclude the existence of the Gâteaux derivative from there. I guess there must be some theorem from linear algebra, but so far my research didn't give me an answer either. Some more context on how I encountered this problem The operator $A$ is the generator $\\Delta$ of a symmetric random walk $(X_t)_{t\\geq0}$ on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, restricted to a finite, connected subset: \\begin{equation*}\n\\Delta_I f(x) = \\sum_{y\\in\\mathbb{Z}^d:\\ |x-y|=1} \\omega_{xy} [f(y)-f(x)], \\qquad x\\in I,\\ f: \\mathbb{Z}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R},\\ \\mathrm{supp}(f)\\subset I\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\omega_{xy}=\\omega_{yx}\\in(0,\\infty)$ are symmetric weights. Then I need $\\Lambda(V):=\\lambda(V)-\\lambda(0)$ to be Gâteaux differentiable and continuous with respect to pointwise convergence in order to apply a large deviations principle with rate function $\\Lambda$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proposition. Let $P(x,t)=\\sum_{i=0}^na_i(t)x^i$ where the $(a_i(t))$ are $C^k$. We assume that $P(x_0,t_0)=0$ where $x_0$ is a simple root of $P(x,t_0)=0$. Then, in a neighborhood of $(x_0,t_0)$, there is $\\phi\\in C^k$ s.t. $x_0=\\phi(t_0),P(\\phi(t),t)=0$. Proof. Since $x_0$ is a simple root, $\\dfrac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}(x_0,t_0)\\not= 0$. According to the implicit function theorem, we are done. Application. Let $A(t)$ be a non-negative irreducible matrix that $C^k$ depends on $t$. Then $\\rho(A(t))$ is a simple positive  eigenvalue of $A(t)$ and, consequently, is a $C^k$ function of $t$ (put $P(x,t)=\\det(A(t)-xI_n)$). Now, when the eigenvalues of $A(t)$ are not simple, it is more complicated. One can prove that there are CONTINUOUS functions $(x_i(t))_{i\\leq n}$ (eventually complex) s.t. for every $t$, $spectrum(A(t))=(x_i(t))_{i\\leq n}$. Thus, if $A(t)$ is symmetric, then the greatest eigenvalue of $A(t)$ is $\\sup_ix_i(t)$, that is clearly a continuous function of $t$. EDIT. Answer to @ Amarus . Your question is essentially about the continuity (or diff.) of the roots of a polynomial. The question of continuity is treated here: http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1965-016-01/S0002-9939-1965-0171902-8/S0002-9939-1965-0171902-8.pdf Note that all proofs of the previous result use the Rouché's theorem. There is an intermediate result: if the polynomial has real $C^{\\infty}$ coefficients with only real roots (hyperbolic polynomial), then each root is Lipschitz (due to Bronshtein) -one can soften the condition $C^{\\infty}$- Beware. The eigenvectors cannot necessarily be written as continuous functions.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the main problem.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user is asking about when the largest eigenvalue function of a symmetric linear operator is continuous and Gâteaux differentiable. The problem statement includes several components:\n\n1. The function λ(V) is defined as the supremum of ⟨(A+V)f, f⟩ over unit vectors f in ℓ²(I).\n2. I is a finite index set (subset of ℤ^d).\n3. A is a symmetric linear operator on ℓ²(I), nonnegative outside its diagonal, making -A positive definite.\n4. V acts as a diagonal matrix diag(V1, ..., Vn) in ℓ²(I).\n5. The context mentions A is the generator of a symmetric random walk restricted to a finite, connected subset.\n\nThe user is confused about two parts: swapping the limit and supremum in (1) and the existence of the Gâteaux derivative in (2). They reference the Perron-Frobenius theorem and basic linear algebra for continuity and differentiability.\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse through the question to extract these:\n\n- I is a finite index set (specifically a subset of ℤ^d). This is one assumption about the nature of I.\n- A is a symmetric linear operator on ℓ²(I). That's another assumption about A.\n- A is nonnegative outside its diagonal. This is a separate condition on A.\n- -A is positive definite. Wait, the original says \"-A is positive definite\" because A is nonnegative outside its diagonal. But maybe this is redundant? The user states \"-A is positive definite\" as a given, so that's another assumption.\n- V ∈ ℓ²(I) acts as a diagonal matrix. So V is a diagonal operator, which is a condition on V.\n- The problem is set in the context where A is the generator of a symmetric random walk restricted to a finite connected subset. However, this might be context rather than an assumption. The user includes this as part of the problem's background, but perhaps it's not a direct assumption for the mathematical problem. So maybe we can exclude that part unless it's critical to the problem's conditions.\n\nThe problem then is to show that λ(V) is continuous and Gâteaux differentiable. Specifically, the two parts (1) and (2) mentioned are the key points to address.\n\nNow, structuring the assumptions:\n\n1. I is a finite index set (subset of ℤ^d).\n2. A: ℓ²(I) → ℓ²(I) is a symmetric linear operator.\n3. A is nonnegative outside its diagonal.\n4. -A is positive definite.\n5. V ∈ ℓ²(I) acts as a diagonal matrix diag(V₁, ..., V_n).\n\nThe problem is to prove continuity and Gâteaux differentiability of λ(V), especially focusing on the two equations (1) and (2). However, the original problem statement in the user's question is a bit more detailed. Let me check the exact problem statement again.\n\nThe original problem statement says: \"I want to understand why the following function... is continuous and Gâteaux differentiable.\" Then the specific parts (1) and (2) are sub-problems. However, the user wants the formatted problem to encapsulate the main problem, which is proving continuity and differentiability, with the two parts as aspects of that. But according to the example given, the problem should be phrased as the main problem statement.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be: Prove that the function λ(V) (defined as the supremum...) is continuous and Gâteaux differentiable.\n\nTherefore, compiling the assumptions based on the problem description and excluding the contextual background (since the example also excluded some context and focused on the mathematical conditions).\n\nChecking each part:\n\n- The index set I is finite, which is important because operators on finite-dimensional spaces have different properties (like compactness).\n- A is symmetric, which ensures real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.\n- A being nonnegative outside the diagonal and -A positive definite might be redundant? Wait, nonnegative outside the diagonal could mean that the off-diagonal entries are nonnegative, and the diagonal entries are such that -A is positive definite. That's a specific condition on A, perhaps ensuring that A is a negative definite matrix except for the off-diagonal nonnegativity. This might relate to properties of the generator in the context of the random walk.\n\nSo each of these conditions is an assumption.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove continuity and Gâteaux differentiability of λ(V). The example given in the user's instruction had the problem line start with \"Prove that...\". So here, the problem should be \"Prove that the function λ(V) = ... is continuous and Gâteaux differentiable.\"\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- I is a finite index set (subset of ℤ^d),\n- A: ℓ²(I) → ℓ²(I) is a symmetric linear operator,\n- A is nonnegative outside its diagonal,\n- -A is positive definite,\n- V ∈ ℓ²(I) acts as a diagonal matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the function  \nλ(V) = sup_{f ∈ ℓ²(I): ‖f‖₂=1} ⟨(A + V)f, f⟩  \nis continuous and Gâteaux differentiable.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions two specific parts: the limit and supremum swap in (1), and the existence of the Gâteaux derivative in (2). However, the user's example condensed the problem into a single statement. The original problem's main question is about continuity and differentiability, so the formatted problem should reflect that. The two parts (1) and (2) are steps toward proving that, but perhaps the main problem is the continuity and differentiability, with the assumptions given.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture the main goal as stated in the question's title and initial paragraph. The specific equations (1) and (2) are parts of that proof but may not need to be included in the problem statement if the user's example is followed. For example, in the original example, the problem was restated as proving divisibility by 91, which was the main question, even though the original problem had more details.\n\nThus, the correct formatted problem is as above. Now, check for each assumption:\n\n- Finite index set I: yes.\n- Symmetric operator A: yes.\n- A nonnegative outside diagonal: yes.\n- -A positive definite: yes.\n- V acts as diagonal matrix: yes.\n\nThese are all the key assumptions given in the problem statement. The context about the random walk is part of the motivation but not an assumption needed for the mathematical problem's conditions.",
