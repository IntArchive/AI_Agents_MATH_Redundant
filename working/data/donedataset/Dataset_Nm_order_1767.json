    "Content": "In this question I will use the following definition of a Dedekind domain: An integral domain $A$ is a Dedekind Domain if: 1) $A$ is a Noetherian Ring. 2) $A$ is integrally closed. 3) Every non-zero prime ideal of $A$ is maximal. I also know that every non-zero ideal $I \\subset A$ can be expressed uniquely as a product of powers of prime ideals (a proof that does not use results from localization or primary decomposition can be found in Pierre Samuel's Algebraic Theory of Numbers ). With this information, and without having been taught localization (this is for an undergrad class in ANT) is it possible to prove the following statement: If $A$ is a Dedekind Domain and $I \\subset A$ a non-zero ideal, then every ideal of $A/I$ is principal. --I should point out that I can come up with a proof when I know that in a Dedekind domain $A$ if $p \\subset A$ is a non-zero prime (hence maximal) ideal, then the localization $A_p$ is a P.I.D. But, as we have not been taught localization in class I cannot use it to solve the question. I also looked at Atiyah- Macdonald, and they basically prove this as Theorem 9.3, but they use results from localization and primary decomposition.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes. Factor $I = \\displaystyle\\prod_{i =1}^n \\mathfrak{p}_i^{e^i}.$ Then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem $A/I \\cong \\displaystyle\\bigoplus_{i =1}^n A/\\mathfrak{p}_i^{e^i}.$ So it is enough to show each factor $A/\\mathfrak{p}_i^{e^i}$ is principal. The ideals of $A/\\mathfrak{p}_i^{e^i}$ are exactly the images of the ideals of $A$ containing $\\mathfrak{p}_i^{e^i},$ i.e., $\\mathfrak{p}_i^{n}$ for $1\\le n \\leq e_i,$ under the projection map $\\pi:A \\rightarrow A/\\mathfrak{p}_i^{e^i}.$ If $\\pi(\\mathfrak{p}_i) = \\pi(\\mathfrak{p}_i^2)$ then $\\pi( \\mathfrak{p}_i) = 0$ and $A/\\mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i}$ is a field. Otherwise, let $\\alpha \\in\\pi( \\mathfrak{p}_i) \\setminus \\pi(\\mathfrak{p}_i^2).$ Then $(\\alpha)$ is a proper ideal such that $(\\alpha) \\not\\subset \\pi(\\mathfrak{p}_i^n) $ for any $n\\ge 2.$ It follows $(\\alpha) = \\pi(\\mathfrak{p}_i).$ We conclude $\\pi(\\mathfrak{p}_i^n) = (\\alpha^n)$ and hence $A/\\mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i}$ is principal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure the given problem according to the example provided. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem by listing assumptions line by line and then the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The title is: \"If $A$ is a Dedekind domain and $I \\subset A$ a non-zero ideal, then every ideal of $A/I$ is principal.\" The question body provides more context. The user is using a specific definition of a Dedekind domain with three conditions: Noetherian, integrally closed, and every non-zero prime ideal is maximal. They also mention knowing that every non-zero ideal can be uniquely factored into prime ideals, referencing Samuel's book. The goal is to prove that for a Dedekind domain $A$ and a non-zero ideal $I$, every ideal of $A/I$ is principal without using localization or primary decomposition, as those haven't been taught yet.\n\nSo, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given had assumptions listed as single properties per line. Let's start with the assumptions.\n\nFirst, the main object is $A$, which is a Dedekind domain. According to the user's definition, this means three things: $A$ is an integral domain, Noetherian, integrally closed, and every non-zero prime ideal is maximal. However, in the example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So I need to split the Dedekind domain conditions into individual assumptions. But wait, the user's definition includes three conditions. However, in the example, the assumption was split into \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So each line is a separate condition.\n\nSo for the problem here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $A$ is a Dedekind domain (but according to the user's definition, this includes three conditions). However, since the user defines a Dedekind domain with those three properties, perhaps the assumption is just \"$A$ is a Dedekind domain\" as per the given definition. But the problem may require breaking down the definition into separate assumptions? Wait, in the example, the problem had an assumption that $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the example added that. Wait, no—the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was wrong? Wait, looking back: the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7; it's for every integer n. So perhaps the example is not a good one, but the user provided it. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the instruction is to structure the problem as in the example.\n\nBut in the given problem here, the user defines a Dedekind domain with three properties, but the problem states \"If A is a Dedekind domain and I subset A a non-zero ideal, then every ideal of A/I is principal.\" So the main assumptions are:\n\n- A is a Dedekind domain (with the given three conditions)\n\n- I is a non-zero ideal of A\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$A$ is an integral domain,\n\n$A$ is a Noetherian ring,\n\n$A$ is integrally closed,\n\nEvery non-zero prime ideal of $A$ is maximal,\n\n$I$ is a non-zero ideal of $A$,\n\nEvery non-zero ideal of $A$ can be expressed uniquely as a product of powers of prime ideals.\n\nWait, the user mentions they know that every non-zero ideal can be uniquely factored into prime ideals. But is that part of the definition of a Dedekind domain or a consequence? In standard definitions, the unique factorization into prime ideals is a theorem following the definition (as in the three conditions). So the user is using the three conditions as the definition and knows the unique factorization as a theorem. Since the user includes that in the problem statement, maybe that's an additional assumption they can use. So the problem's assumptions would include all the conditions that define a Dedekind domain (as given by the user) plus the fact that ideals factor uniquely into primes, plus the ideal I being non-zero.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is to prove that every ideal of A/I is principal given that A is Dedekind (with the three conditions) and I is a non-zero ideal. The user also mentions they know the unique factorization of ideals, so perhaps that is an additional assumption, but since it's a known theorem for them, maybe it's part of the premises. However, in the problem statement, the user is allowed to use that fact. So perhaps the assumptions should include the unique factorization of ideals as a given, because it's a result they can use.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was split into n being an integer and n divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as in the example, so the example might have been an illustration, even if not accurate. So in the example, the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it. That suggests that perhaps the assistant is supposed to extract all necessary assumptions from the problem, including any that might be implicit. But in the example, maybe the original problem was different. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was misformatted, but the user wants the problem structured by listing all the assumptions given in the problem. The original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n...\" but the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. However, the user might have intended that, so perhaps they want all the conditions mentioned in the problem to be split into individual assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user states that A is a Dedekind domain (with the three conditions), I is a non-zero ideal, and the task is to prove every ideal of A/I is principal. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is an integral domain,\n\n- A is a Noetherian ring,\n\n- A is integrally closed,\n\n- Every non-zero prime ideal of A is maximal,\n\n- I is a non-zero ideal of A,\n\n- Every non-zero ideal of A can be uniquely expressed as a product of powers of prime ideals.\n\nWait, but the unique factorization is a theorem, not part of the definition. The user says \"I also know that every non-zero ideal I subset A can be expressed uniquely as a product of powers of prime ideals...\". So this is a known result, which they can use. Therefore, the unique factorization is not an assumption but a given fact they can use. However, in the problem structure, the Assumption section lists all the premises needed. So if the problem is to prove the statement given that A is a Dedekind domain (defined by three conditions) and I is a non-zero ideal, and that unique factorization holds, then those would be the assumptions. But the problem statement as posed by the user is: \"If A is a Dedekind Domain and I subset A a non-zero ideal, then every ideal of A/I is principal.\" So the explicit assumptions are A is a Dedekind domain (with the three given properties) and I is a non-zero ideal. The unique factorization is a theorem they can use, but it's not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- A is an integral domain,\n\n- A is Noetherian,\n\n- A is integrally closed,\n\n- Every non-zero prime ideal of A is maximal,\n\n- I is a non-zero ideal of A.\n\nBut the user's definition of Dedekind domain includes these four points (integral domain, Noetherian, integrally closed, non-zero primes are maximal). Wait, the user writes:\n\n\"An integral domain A is a Dedekind Domain if: 1) A is a Noetherian Ring. 2) A is integrally closed. 3) Every non-zero prime ideal of A is maximal.\"\n\nSo the definition of Dedekind domain here is an integral domain satisfying 1,2,3. Therefore, the assumption is \"A is a Dedekind domain\", which encompasses all four points. Wait, but in the example, they split the assumptions into separate lines. For example, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. But in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", which doesn't include divisibility by 7. That suggests that the example might have added an extra assumption. But perhaps the example was incorrect, but regardless, the user wants to split the assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one property.\n\nBut in this problem, the Dedekind domain definition includes multiple properties. So according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property. Therefore, we need to split the definition of Dedekind domain into its constituent parts. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is an integral domain,\n\n- A is a Noetherian ring,\n\n- A is integrally closed,\n\n- Every non-zero prime ideal of A is maximal,\n\n- I is a non-zero ideal of A.\n\nAdditionally, the user mentions that they know every non-zero ideal can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime ideals. However, this is a theorem in their context, so it's a known result, not an assumption. Therefore, it's not listed as an assumption but can be used in the proof. But if the problem requires this theorem, perhaps it's an implicit assumption. However, the problem statement as given by the user is to prove the statement using the given definition of Dedekind domain and the unique factorization theorem. Therefore, the unique factorization is a known result, not an assumption of the problem. Hence, it's not listed in the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the four properties defining a Dedekind domain (integral domain, Noetherian, integrally closed, non-zero primes maximal) and I being a non-zero ideal. Each of these should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nNow, the problem statement is: \"Prove that every ideal of $A/I$ is principal.\"\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n$A$ is an integral domain,\n$A$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$A$ is integrally closed,\nEvery non-zero prime ideal of $A$ is maximal,\n$I$ is a non-zero ideal of $A$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every ideal of $A/I$ is principal.\n\nBut wait, in the user's example, they combined the Dedekind domain into one line as \"A is a Dedekind domain\" but in the example's case, the problem had multiple conditions for n. However, the user's example split the assumptions into separate lines. Since the user's example treated each property as a separate line, even if they were part of a definition, we should do the same here. Therefore, splitting the Dedekind domain definition into its components.\n\nBut wait, the user's example had a problem where the original assumption was for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7; it was added in the formatted problem. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but regardless, we need to follow the instruction: \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\".\n\nTherefore, in this problem, the Dedekind domain is defined by four conditions (integral domain, Noetherian, integrally closed, non-zero primes maximal). Each of these should be a separate assumption line. Additionally, I being a non-zero ideal is another assumption.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$A$ is an integral domain,\n$A$ is a Noetherian ring,\n$A$ is integrally closed,\nEvery non-zero prime ideal of $A$ is maximal,\n$I$ is a non-zero ideal of $A$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every ideal of $A/I$ is principal.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions that they know the unique factorization of ideals into prime ideals. Should that be included as an assumption? The problem statement doesn't require it as an assumption; it's a theorem they can use. The problem is to prove the statement given that A is a Dedekind domain (with the four properties) and I is non-zero. The unique factorization is a consequence of the Dedekind domain properties, so it's a theorem they can use without listing it as an assumption. Therefore, it's not part of the assumptions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem is as above.",
