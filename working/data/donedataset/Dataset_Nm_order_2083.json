    "Content": "I wish to prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$, $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Proving that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+2$ is simple using a proof analogous to that of Euclid. It goes as follows: Suppose there are finitely many primes of the form $3k+2$ and let $S=\\{p_1,p_2,...,p_j\\}$ denote the finite set of all such primes. Now consider the number $n=3p_1p_2...p_j+2$. $n$ is clearly of the form $3k+2$. If $n$ is prime, we have a contradiction. If $n$ is composite, it must be divisible by a prime number $q$ of the form $3k+2$ (One can list the possibilities to convince oneself of this). But clearly $gcd(n,p)=1$ for every $p\\in S$, which implies that $q\\notin S$ - a contradiction. Thus our assumption that the number of such primes is finite must be false. The problem is that when one attempts to apply the same proof to primes of the form $3k+1$, one runs into the difficulty that $(3k+2)^2=9k^2+12k+4=3(3k^2+4k+1)+1$, and thus a composite number of the form $3k+1$ needn't necessarily be divisible by a prime of the same form. Is there any way of adjusting the proof so that it works for primes of the form $3k+1$ or does the problem call for a completely different proof-method?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The usual proof of this uses the fact that any prime dividing a number\nof the form $f(n)=n^2+n+1$ has to be congruent to $0$ or $1$\nmodulo $3$. If $p\\mid f(n)$ and $p\\ne3$ then $n^3\\equiv1\\pmod p$\nbut $n\\not\\equiv1\\pmod p$. This will contradict Lagrange's theorem\napplied to the multiplicative group $\\Bbb F_p^\\times$ of integers not divisible\nby $p$ modulo $p$. Now do the usual trick of considering the prime factorisation of $f(n)$\nwhen $n$ has a lot of prime factors you want to avoid.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"Proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers of the form $3k+1$.\" The question discusses trying to use a Euclid-style proof similar to the one used for primes of the form $3k+2$, but runs into issues because a composite number of the form $3k+1$ might not have a prime divisor of the same form. The user is asking if the proof can be adjusted or if a different method is needed.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem for assumptions.\n\nThe main goal is to prove there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$ where $k$ is a natural number. The user mentions the proof for $3k+2$ primes using a Euclid-like approach but points out a complication when applying it to $3k+1$ primes. The key issue is that a composite number of the form $3k+1$ might not have a prime factor of the same form, unlike in the $3k+2$ case.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The primes in question are of the form $3k+1$ where $k$ is a natural number. (This defines the form of the primes we're considering.)\n\n2. The user is considering a proof by contradiction, similar to Euclid's, assuming finitely many such primes. (This is the method they're trying to apply.)\n\n3. The problem arises because the square of a prime of the form $3k+2$ results in a number of the form $3k+1$, which complicates the divisibility argument. (This is a specific obstacle mentioned.)\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is asking whether the Euclid-style proof can be adjusted or if a different method is needed. The assumptions should be the given conditions and the setup of the problem. Let me re-express:\n\nThe problem is to prove there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$. The user tried a method analogous to the $3k+2$ case but encountered an issue. So the assumptions here are related to the structure of the primes and the attempted proof method.\n\nBut according to the example provided, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. The original problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- Considering primes of the form $3k+1$, where $k$ is a natural number.\n\n- The proof method analogous to Euclid's for $3k+2$ primes leads to a difficulty because a composite number of form $3k+1$ may not have a prime divisor of the same form.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So perhaps in this case, the assumptions should be the properties given in the problem, not the issues in the proof.\n\nWait, maybe the problem here is to structure the actual mathematical problem, not the meta-discussion about the proof. The original question is \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$, $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\" The rest is the user's discussion about their attempts and obstacles.\n\nSo the problem statement is to prove there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$, and the user is asking if the Euclid-style proof can be adjusted. But when structuring the problem, the Assumptions part should list the given conditions. However, in the original problem, the only assumption is that the primes are of the form $3k+1$, and $k$ is a natural number. But perhaps more precisely:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $k$ is a natural number.\n\n- The primes considered are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem. Here, the problem is about primes of the form $3k+1$, so the key assumption is that we are considering primes of that form, and $k$ is a natural number. However, in the example, the assumption included conditions like divisibility by 7. Here, there are no such additional conditions; the problem is to prove infinitude, so maybe the only assumption is the form of the primes. But the user also mentions the attempted proof method, but perhaps that's part of the problem context, not the assumptions of the problem itself.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, the question is to prove infinitude of primes of form 3k+1. The user's problem is asking about adjusting the Euclid-style proof. But when structuring the problem as per the format, maybe the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem, not the proof method. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: Primes considered are of the form $3k + 1$ where $k$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut the user's question also references the difficulty in the proof method. However, the example provided in the instructions seems to focus on the problem's mathematical conditions rather than the proof's obstacles. So maybe the assumptions should be strictly the mathematical conditions given in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem here includes the context that the user tried a Euclid-style proof but encountered an issue. However, according to the example, the formatted problem only includes the problem statement and its assumptions, not the attempted methods or obstacles. So maybe the problem is just as stated: Prove there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$, with the assumption that such primes are of that form and $k$ is natural.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user is asking if the proof can be adjusted or requires a different method. However, when structuring the problem, the user wants to extract the problem and assumptions, filtering out the unrelated info. The original question's core is \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$\". The rest is the user's discussion about their attempts.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: Primes are of the form $3k + 1$ for some natural number $k$.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumption here is that primes are being considered modulo 3. Specifically, primes congruent to 1 mod 3. So maybe the assumption is that primes are congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since all primes (except 3) are either 1 or 2 mod 3. So the assumption is that we're looking at primes where the congruence is 1 mod 3.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So similarly, here, the problem's assumption is that we are considering primes of the form 3k+1, i.e., primes congruent to 1 modulo 3. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: Primes are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nBut the user's problem statement mentions $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, so maybe:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number.\n\nAssumption: Primes considered are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, two assumptions:\n\n1. $k$ is a natural number.\n\n2. Primes are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut maybe the first assumption is redundant because the form $3k+1$ implies $k$ is an integer, but since the user specifies $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, perhaps that's an explicit assumption.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user wrote: \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$, $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\" So the problem statement includes that $k$ is a natural number. Therefore, in the assumptions, we should list:\n\n1. $k$ is a natural number.\n\n2. Primes are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number,\n\nPrimes are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut in the example provided, the original problem's assumption about divisibility by 7 was part of the problem's conditions, but in that case, the user had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no: the example given by the user was an original problem where the formatted version included an assumption that wasn't in the original. Wait, in the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was structured incorrectly. Or maybe there was a mistake in the example. But according to the user's example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. But maybe that's part of the process where sometimes the original problem might have implicit assumptions that need to be made explicit.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question is to prove there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$, $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. So the explicit assumptions are that $k$ is a natural number and the primes are of the form $3k+1$. However, the original problem doesn't state any other conditions. The user's discussion about the proof complications is part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, when structuring the problem, we should focus on the problem's explicit conditions.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number,\n\nPrimes are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut maybe \"primes are of the form $3k + 1$\" is redundant because the problem is to prove that there are infinitely many such primes. The assumption is that we are considering primes of that form. Wait, perhaps the problem is to prove the infinitude, so the only assumption is that $k$ is a natural number. But primes are of the form $3k + 1$ is the property we are considering. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply to prove the infinitude, and the only assumption is that we're working within the natural numbers. But in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is incorrect, but following the user's example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which is stricter. So maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. But perhaps the task is to filter the problem and list all assumptions from the original problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption. But in any case, following the user's example, even if it's incorrect, we need to structure the current problem in the same way.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in this problem, we need to list the assumptions as per the problem's statement. The original problem says \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$, $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n- $k$ is a natural number.\n\n- The primes are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number,\n\nPrimes are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut the original problem's user also mentions the issue with the proof method. However, according to the instructions, we need to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem. The discussion about the proof difficulties is unrelated to the problem's assumptions and should be filtered out. Therefore, the formatted problem should focus solely on the mathematical problem, not the user's proof attempts.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is as above. However, maybe the assumption about primes being of the form $3k +1$ is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove infinitude, and the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem holds.\n\nBut in the original problem, there are no additional conditions; it's a general statement. So perhaps the only assumption is that we are considering primes of the form $3k+1$ where $k$ is a natural number. However, the problem is to prove their infinitude. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. $k$ is a natural number.\n\n2. We are considering primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut perhaps the second point is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The example's formatting is a bit confusing. In the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, for the current problem:\n\nOriginal problem states \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k+1$, $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\" So the assumptions would be:\n\n- $k$ is a natural number.\n\n- The problem concerns primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number,\n\nPrimes are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut perhaps \"Primes are of the form $3k + 1$\" is redundant because the problem is to prove there are infinitely many such primes, so the assumption is just about $k$ being natural. However, the problem's statement is about primes of that form, so maybe the assumption is that we are considering such primes. But in the example, the assumption included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the formatted problem in the example added an assumption not present in the original problem, which might be an error. Therefore, following the user's instructions strictly, we need to extract the problem and assumptions from the original question, filtering out unrelated info.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is to prove infinitude of primes of the form $3k+1$ where $k$ is a natural number. The user's discussion about the proof complications is extraneous. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number,\n\nPrimes are of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nAlternatively, since primes being of the form $3k +1$ is the subject of the problem, perhaps the only assumption is that $k$ is a natural number, and the problem is to prove the infinitude. But in the example, the assumption included both the domain of n and an extra condition (divisible by 7). Given that, perhaps the formatted problem here would include:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBecause the problem is to prove there are infinitely many primes of that form, and the assumption is that $k$ is a natural number. The form $3k+1$ is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow their format. In that example, they added an assumption not present in the original problem. However, perhaps in the original problem, the divisibility by 7 was a hidden condition, but it's unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's example where they took the original problem's \"for every integer n\" and turned it into an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7 (which changes the problem), perhaps there's a misunderstanding. However, in the current problem, the user is not adding any extra conditions, so the formatted problem should reflect the original question's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut the problem's statement includes the form $3k+1$ with $k$ natural. Hence, the assumption is just about $k$, and the problem is to prove the infinitude. The form $3k+1$ is part of the problem's target.\n\nAlternatively, if following the example where the problem's target (divisibility by 91) and the assumptions were n being integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions, then perhaps here the assumption is that primes are of the form $3k + 1$ and $k$ is natural. But since the problem is to prove there are infinitely many such primes, the form is part of what's to be proven, not an assumption.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, but I think the key is that in the user's example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So similarly, here, the original problem says \"k is a natural number\", so the assumption is that k is a natural number, and the problem is to prove the infinitude of primes of the form $3k +1$.\n\nHence:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"primes of the form $3k+1$\", so maybe another assumption is that the primes are considered in that form. But since the problem is to prove their existence, maybe the form is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. However, in the example, the divisibility by 91 was the problem, and the assumptions were about n. So perhaps the form of the primes is part of the problem, not an assumption. Therefore, only the condition on k is an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Primes of the form $3k + 1$\" is an assumption. For example, if the problem was \"Prove that primes of the form $3k+1$ are infinite\", then the assumption is that such primes exist, but actually, the problem is to prove their infinitude. Hence, perhaps the only assumption is that k is a natural number.\n\nGiven the confusion, but following the user's example where the original problem's variable condition (n is integer) was listed as an assumption, even though it was part of the problem's universal quantification, perhaps here similarly:\n\nAssumption: $k$ is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 1$.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. The problem is to prove that for natural numbers k, there are infinitely many primes of the form 3k +1. Hence, the assumption is that k is a natural number, and the problem is as stated.",
