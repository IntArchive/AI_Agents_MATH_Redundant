    "Content": "TL;DR : The question is how do I show that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{ik^2}=0$ ? More generaly the question would be : given an increasing sequence of integers $(u_k)$ and an irrational number $\\alpha$, how do I tell if  $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{2i\\pi \\alpha u_k}=0$ ? I'm not asking for a criterium for completely general sequences, an answer for sequences like $u_k=k^2$, $v_k=k!$ or $w_k=p(k)$ with $p\\in \\mathbf Z [X]$ would already be awesome. A little explanation about this question : In Real and Complex Analysis by Rudin there is the folowing exercise : Let $f$ be a continuous, complex valued, $1$-periodic function and $\\alpha$ an irrational number. Show that \n$\\displaystyle \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f(\\alpha k)=\\int_0^1f(x)\\mathrm d x$. (We say that $(\\alpha k)_k$ is uniformly distributed in $\\mathbf R / \\mathbf Z$) With the hint given by Rudin the proof is pretty straightforward : First one show that this is true for every $f_j=\\exp(2i\\pi j\\cdot)$ with $j\\in \\mathbf{Z} $. Then using density of trigonometric polynomials in $(C^0_1(\\mathbf{R}),\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$ and the fact that the $0$-th Fourier coefficient of $f$ is it's integral over a period, one can conclude using a $3\\varepsilon$ argument. This proof is possible because one can compute explicitly the sums $$\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{2i\\pi j \\alpha k}=\\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\frac{1-e^{2i\\pi j\\alpha n}}{1-e^{2i\\pi j\\alpha}}\\longrightarrow 0 \\text{ when }n\\to\\infty \\text{ and }j\\in \\mathbf{Z}^*.$$ Now using a different approach (with dynamical systems and ergodic theorems) Tao show in his blog that $(\\alpha k^2)_k  $ is uniformly distributed in $\\mathbf R / \\mathbf Z$ (corollary 2 in this blog ). I'd like to prove this result using the methods of the exercice of Rudin, but this reduce to show that $$\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{2i\\pi j \\alpha k^2}\\longrightarrow 0 \\text{ when }n\\to\\infty \\text{ and }j\\in \\mathbf{Z}^*.$$ Hence my question. P.S. When i ask wolfram alpha to compute $\\sum_{k\\geq0}e^{ik^2}$ it answer me with some particular value of the Jacobi-theta function. Of course the serie is not convergent but maybe it's some kind of resummation technique or analytic continuation. I'm not familiar with these things but it might be interesting to look in that direction.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Gauss sums Your sum is strongly related to the Gauss sum . The usual trick is to compute the modulus. This works particularly smoothly over $\\mathbf{Z}/p\\mathbf{Z}$ as with usual Gauss sums, but essentially it works here too: If $S = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{ik^2},$ then\n\\begin{align}\n|S|^2 &= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\sum_{k'=0}^{n-1} e^{i(k'^2 - k^2)}\\\\\n &= \\sum_{h=-n+1}^{n-1} \\sum_{\\substack{0\\leq k<n\\\\ 0\\leq k+h<n}} e^{i(2kh+h^2)},\n\\end{align}\nwhere we have written $h=k'-k$. Now the inner sum is a geometric series with at most $n$ terms and with common ratio $e^{i2h}$, so we have\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\left|\\sum_{\\substack{0\\leq k<n\\\\ 0\\leq k+h<n}} e^{i(2kh+h^2)}\\right| \\leq \\min\\left(\\frac{2}{|1-e^{i2h}|},n\\right).\n\\end{equation}\nThus\n\\begin{equation}\n  |S|^2 \\leq 2\\sum_{h=0}^{n-1} \\min\\left(\\frac2{|1-e^{i2h}|},n\\right).\n\\end{equation}\nNow fix $\\epsilon>0$. Since $(h/\\pi)_{h=1}^\\infty$ is equidistributed mod $1$ the number of $h=0,\\dots,n-1$ for which $|1-e^{i2h}| \\leq \\epsilon$ is $O(\\epsilon n)$, so\n\\begin{equation}\n  |S|^2 \\leq 2\\sum_{\\substack{0\\leq h < n\\\\ |1-e^{i2h}| \\leq \\epsilon}}n + 2\\sum_{\\substack{0\\leq h < n\\\\ |1-e^{i2h}| > \\epsilon}} \\frac2{|1-e^{i2h}|} \\leq O(\\epsilon n^2) + O(\\epsilon^{-1} n).\n\\end{equation}\nSince $\\epsilon$ was arbitrary this implies $|S|^2=o(n^2)$, and hence $|S|=o(n)$. The van der Corput trick The only thing we really used about $k^2$ here is that for fixed $h$ we understand the behaviour of the sequence $(k+h)^2 - k^2$, and indeed if you repeat the above calculation but with a judicious application of the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality then you prove a general fact called van der Corput's difference theorem (aka Weyl's differencing trick): if $(u_k)$ is a sequence such that for each $h\\geq 1$ the sequence $(u_{k+h}-u_k)$ is equidistributed modulo $1$, then $(u_k)$ is equidistributed modulo $1$. See for example Corollary 2 on Tao's blog here . This implies for example that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i2\\pi p(k)} = o(n)$ for every nonconstant polynomial $p$ with irrational leading coefficient. Other sequences In general there is no hard and fast rule about $\\lim \\frac1n \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i2\\pi \\alpha u_k}$, i.e., about equidistribution of $(u_k)$, and in fact the other sequence you mention, $k!$, is indeed very different. To take a slightly simpler example which is qualitatively similar, consider $u_k = 2^k$. Let $f_n(\\alpha)$ be the exponential sum $\\frac1n \\sum_{k=1}^n e^{i2\\pi \\alpha 2^k}$. Then it is a well known consequence of the ergodic theorem that $f_n(\\alpha)$ converges to $0$ for almost every $\\alpha$. On the other hand clearly $f_n(\\alpha)\\to 1$ for every dyadic rational $\\alpha$, as $\\alpha 2^k$ is eventually constantly $0$ mod $1$. But then by Baire category theorem we must have for a comeagre set of $\\alpha$ that $f_n(\\alpha)$ does not converge to $0$. Thus it's difficult to say anything too general about $f_n(\\alpha)$, especially for particular $\\alpha$. For instance, proving $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(\\sqrt{2})=0$ is a famous open problem. Test your understanding Here are some related problems to think about, not all of which I know off-hand how to answer! Is $(\\sqrt{n})$ equidistributed mod $1$? What about $(\\log n)$? Show that there are some $\\alpha$ for which $f_n(\\alpha)$ does not converge. Determine $\\{z: f_n(\\alpha)\\to z~\\text{for some}~\\alpha\\}$. Let $g_n(\\alpha) = \\frac1n \\sum_{k=1}^n e^{i2\\pi \\alpha k!}$. Prove statements for $g_n$ analogous to those we proved for $f_n$. Is there a power of $2$ with at least $7$ decimal digits equal to $7$? Think of other silly (but not open) problems like these ones.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants to show that the limit of the average of complex exponentials involving k squared is zero. They also generalize the question to other integer sequences and irrational alpha. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the key assumptions. The original problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=0 to n-1 of e^{i k^2}. The user mentions that alpha is an irrational number in the generalized case, but in the specific problem, it seems like alpha is 1/(2π) since e^{i k^2} can be written as e^{2πi α k^2} with α = 1/(2π). Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just e^{ik^2}, which is equivalent to e^{2πi (1/(2π)) k^2}. However, 1/(2π) is irrational because π is transcendental. So maybe alpha here is 1/(2π), which is irrational. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly state alpha's role. Wait, the original problem doesn't mention alpha; the more general question does. The specific problem is just the sum of e^{ik^2}/n. So maybe in the specific problem, the assumption is that the exponent is quadratic in k, and the coefficient is 1, which would correspond to alpha being 1/(2π), but since alpha needs to be irrational, which 1/(2π) is. However, the problem as stated doesn't mention alpha, so perhaps the key assumption is that the exponent is k^2, leading to the sum being related to equidistribution. Alternatively, perhaps the user is assuming that the sequence u_k = k^2 and alpha is irrational, but in the specific problem, maybe alpha is 1, but then 1 is rational. Wait, there's some confusion here.\n\nWait, looking back: The original problem is to show that the limit of (1/n) sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i k^2} is zero. The user then generalizes to sequences like u_k =k^2, v_k=k!, etc., and alpha irrational. In the specific problem, the exponential is e^{i k^2} which can be written as e^{2πi (1/(2π)) k^2}. So here, alpha is 1/(2π), which is irrational because π is transcendental. Therefore, the assumption is that alpha is irrational. However, the problem as stated in the original question doesn't mention alpha; the exponent is just ik^2. So maybe the key assumption here is that the coefficient in front of k^2 in the exponent is an irrational multiple of 2π. Wait, e^{i k^2} = e^{2πi (1/(2π) k^2}, so alpha would be 1/(2π), which is irrational. So the assumption is that alpha is irrational. But in the problem statement, since it's e^{ik^2}, the coefficient is 1, which implies that alpha in the general case is 1/(2π), which is irrational. Therefore, the assumption for the specific problem is that the exponent's coefficient (which is 1 here) is an irrational multiple of 2π. Wait, no. Let me rephrase: The general case in the user's question involves e^{2πi alpha u_k}, and they want to know when the average tends to zero. In the specific problem, the sum is e^{ik^2} which is the same as e^{2πi (1/(2π)) k^2}, so alpha is 1/(2π), which is irrational. So the assumption is that alpha is irrational. Therefore, the problem's assumption is that the coefficient in the exponent (which is 1) corresponds to alpha = 1/(2π) being irrational. However, since the problem statement doesn't mention alpha, but the user's general question does, maybe the key assumption is that the exponent is quadratic with a coefficient that is an irrational multiple of 2π. But in the specific problem, the coefficient is 1, so that alpha = 1/(2π), which is irrational. Therefore, the assumption is that alpha = 1/(2π) is irrational. However, since 1/(2π) is indeed irrational (as π is transcendental), but maybe the problem doesn't state that, but the user knows that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the quadratic sequence k^2 leads to equidistribution modulo 1, hence the average tends to the integral over the unit circle, which is zero. Therefore, the key assumptions might be:\n\n- The sequence u_k = k^2.\n\n- The parameter alpha is irrational (though in the specific problem, alpha is 1/(2π), which is irrational).\n\nBut wait, in the specific problem, the user writes e^{ik^2}, which is e^{i k^2} without any alpha. So perhaps in this case, the exponent is k^2, and the general theory for equidistribution requires that the coefficient in front of k^2 is irrational. But in the specific problem, the coefficient is 1, so if we consider the term alpha k^2 where alpha is 1, but 1 is rational. However, the user references Tao's blog where alpha is irrational. So perhaps there's a confusion here. Wait, let me re-read the user's problem.\n\nThe user's specific problem is: Show that the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i k^2} equals zero.\n\nBut in the general question, they mention sequences like u_k =k^2 and alpha irrational. Then, in the P.S., they mention that Wolfram Alpha refers to the Jacobi theta function. \n\nWait, perhaps in the specific problem, the user is considering e^{i k^2} where the coefficient is 1, but 1 is rational, which would contradict the equidistribution result. But Tao's result is for alpha irrational. So maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the user in their own explanation says that in the exercise from Rudin, alpha is irrational, and the sequence alpha k is equidributed. Then, Tao's result is for alpha k^2 being equidributed when alpha is irrational. So the user wants to apply Rudin's method to Tao's result, which requires alpha to be irrational. However, in their specific problem, the exponent is k^2 without any alpha. But perhaps in their specific problem, alpha is 1, which is rational, but that would contradict the equidistribution. Wait, but the problem as stated by the user is to show the limit is zero, which would require that the average of e^{i k^2} tends to zero. But if alpha were rational, the equidistribution might not hold. However, in the specific problem, the user is not specifying alpha, but the exponent is k^2. So maybe the problem as stated has an error, or perhaps the user is considering a different setup. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient in the exponent is 1, but in terms of the general framework, that would correspond to alpha * k^2 where alpha = 1/(2π) as I thought before. Wait, e^{i k^2} = e^{2π i (k^2/(2π))}, so if we set u_k =k^2/(2π), but then alpha would be 1. But 1 is rational. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem is correct, and the user is correct in that even with alpha=1, which is rational, the average tends to zero. But that contradicts equidistribution because if alpha is rational, the sequence alpha k^2 mod 1 might not be equidistributed. For example, if alpha is 1, then k^2 mod 1 is periodic with period 1, but the values would accumulate at certain points. Wait, k^2 mod 1 is not periodic, but for alpha=1, the sequence k^2 mod 1 is not equidistributed. For instance, the fractional parts {k^2} will cluster near 0 and 1 more than in the middle. Therefore, the average of e^{2π i k^2} would not tend to zero. But the user's specific problem is about e^{i k^2}, which is e^{2π i (k^2/(2π))}. So if we set alpha = 1/(2π), which is irrational, then according to Tao's result, the sequence alpha k^2 is equidistributed mod 1, hence the average of e^{2π i alpha k^2} tends to zero. Therefore, in the specific problem, the user's sum is exactly this case with alpha =1/(2π). Since 1/(2π) is irrational, the result follows. Therefore, the key assumption is that alpha is irrational. However, in the problem statement, alpha is not mentioned; the exponent is simply e^{i k^2}. So the assumption here is that the coefficient in the exponent (which is 1) corresponds to an irrational alpha in the general framework. Therefore, the assumption is that 1/(2π) is irrational, which it is. But since the problem doesn't mention alpha, maybe the assumption is that the quadratic sequence k^2 leads to equidistribution, hence the average tends to zero. But the problem's exact assumption isn't explicitly stated. However, in the example given by the user in the original problem (the A(n) divisible by 91), the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumptions should be that the sequence u_k =k^2, alpha is irrational (but in the specific problem, alpha is 1/(2π), which is irrational), and that the average is taken over n terms. So, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sequence $u_k = k^2$ for integers $k \\geq 0$.\n- $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$, which is irrational.\n- The sum is averaged over $n$ terms as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{ik^2}=0. $$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user writes e^{ik^2}, not e^{2πiαk^2}. So perhaps the problem is directly about equidistribution of k^2 modulo 1 scaled by 1/(2π), but I think the key assumption here is that the exponent's coefficient leads to an irrational rotation, hence equidistribution. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a specific case of the general question where alpha is irrational. However, since the problem is presented as a standalone limit, the assumptions need to be extracted from the problem context. The original problem says: Show that the limit is zero. The user's general question is about sequences like k^2 and alpha irrational. Therefore, the assumption in the specific problem is that the exponent's quadratic term corresponds to an irrational alpha in the general framework. Therefore, the key assumption is that alpha is irrational, which in this case is implicit because the coefficient in the exponent (1) corresponds to alpha =1/(2π), which is irrational. Therefore, the assumption should list that alpha is irrational. However, since the problem doesn't mention alpha, maybe the assumption is that the quadratic sequence k^2 is considered, and the result holds due to equidistribution. But to match the example given, where the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\n- $k$ is a non-negative integer (since the sum is from k=0 to n-1).\n- The term in the sum is $e^{ik^2}$.\n- The limit is taken as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nBut those are more part of the problem statement than assumptions. Wait, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions needed for the problem. In the current problem, the key assumption for the result to hold is that the sequence $k^2$ is such that $e^{ik^2}$ averages to zero, which relies on equidistribution properties. The equidistribution of $k^2$ modulo $2\\pi$ (since the exponent is $ik^2 = i k^2$ which can be seen as $k^2$ modulo $2\\pi$). However, equidistribution modulo $2\\pi$ would require that the sequence $k^2 \\alpha$ modulo 1 is equidistributed for some irrational alpha. In this case, if we write $ik^2 = 2\\pi i (k^2/(2\\pi))$, then it's equivalent to alpha =1/(2π), which is irrational. Therefore, the assumption is that alpha =1/(2π) is irrational. But do we need to state that as an assumption? Since alpha being irrational is critical for the equidistribution, yes. However, in the problem as stated, the user doesn't mention alpha; they just present the sum. Therefore, the assumption is implicit that the coefficient in the exponent (which is 1) corresponds to an irrational rotation parameter. Since 1/(2π) is irrational, that's a given, but perhaps it's considered an assumption. However, in the example given, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem but perhaps not explicitly stated. Wait, the original example had the problem statement as \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it's stated \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That contradicts. So maybe the example is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption, but in reality, 91=13*7, so to prove divisibility by 91, one needs to show divisibility by 7 and 13. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the formatted assumption should not add that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. This complicates things.\n\nBut given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should list that alpha is irrational (even though in the problem statement it's implicit via the coefficient), and that the sequence is quadratic. But since the problem as stated is about e^{ik^2}, the key assumption is that the exponent is a quadratic function of k with an irrational coefficient leading to equidistribution. However, since the problem doesn't mention alpha, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The sum is over integers k from 0 to n-1.\n- The exponent in the sum is ik^2.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut those are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. The example given in the original instruction seems to have extracted hidden assumptions (like n divisible by 7) even if the original problem said \"for every integer n\". But that might have been an error. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, the key assumptions are that alpha (the coefficient in front of k^2 divided by 2π) is irrational, which it is in this case, and that the sequence u_k =k^2 is considered. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$ is irrational,\n$u_k = k^2$ for integers $k \\geq 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{ik^2}=0. $$\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention alpha, maybe it's better to frame the assumptions without referencing alpha explicitly. Alternatively, the problem's core is that the quadratic sequence leads to equidistribution, hence the average tends to zero. Therefore, the assumption is that the exponent's argument involves a quadratic sequence with an irrational coefficient leading to equidistribution modulo 1. But since the problem statement is about e^{ik^2}, which translates to e^{2πi*(k^2/(2π))}, and since 1/(2π) is irrational, that's the key assumption. However, whether to include that as an assumption or not is tricky. The example given added an assumption not present in the original problem (divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake. Given the user's instruction to \"filter the unrelated informations and structure that problem as the following format\", perhaps the assumptions should list the necessary conditions for the problem to hold, even if they are implicit. In this case, the necessary condition is that the coefficient in the exponent corresponds to an irrational rotation (alpha irrational). Therefore, the formatted problem would include that alpha is irrational. However, since the problem statement doesn't mention alpha, maybe the assumptions should be:\n\n- $k$ is a non-negative integer.\n- The term $e^{ik^2}$ involves an irrational rotation factor.\n\nBut that's vague. Alternatively, the problem is a specific case of the general equidistribution result for quadratic polynomials with irrational leading coefficient. Therefore, the assumption is that the quadratic term $k^2$ is multiplied by an irrational parameter, which in this case is 1 (but scaled by 2π), making alpha =1/(2π) irrational. So the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$ is irrational,\nThe sequence $u_k = k^2$ for integers $k \\geq 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{ik^2}=0. $$\n\nBut perhaps the assistant is overcomplicating. The user's original problem is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into assumptions and problem. The original question starts with the specific problem and then generalizes. The specific problem is to show the limit is zero for the average of e^{ik^2}. The assumptions needed for this specific problem are that the exponent's coefficient leads to equidistribution, which requires that alpha =1/(2π) is irrational. Therefore, listing that alpha is irrational as an assumption. However, since the problem doesn't mention alpha, maybe the assumption is that the quadratic sequence k^2 is used, and the result follows from equidistribution properties. But to match the example's style, which extracted hidden assumptions, perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- $k$ is a non-negative integer.\n- The exponent $ik^2$ corresponds to an irrational rotation parameter.\n\nBut \"corresponds to an irrational rotation parameter\" is vague. Alternatively, more precisely:\n\n- The sequence $\\{k^2 \\alpha\\}$ is equidistributed modulo 1 for an irrational $\\alpha$.\n\nBut in the specific problem, $\\alpha$ is 1/(2π), which is irrational. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$ is irrational,\n$u_k = k^2$ for integers $k \\geq 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{ik^2}=0. $$\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about the specific sum e^{ik^2}, which doesn't mention alpha, maybe the assumptions are simply that the sum involves quadratic exponents and the limit is as n approaches infinity. But according to the example, assumptions should list conditions applied to one object each. In the example, it was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$k$ is a non-negative integer,\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$ is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{ik^2}=0. $$\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention alpha, so including alpha in assumptions might be adding external information. Alternatively, since the problem is a special case of the general question where alpha is irrational, and the user wants to structure it like the example, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n$k$ is a non-negative integer,\nThe sequence $u_k = k^2$ is considered,\n$\\alpha$ is an irrational number.\n\nBut then in the problem statement, how does alpha come into play? The specific problem doesn't have an alpha. Wait, the user in their question mentions that the general problem is for sequences like u_k=k^2 and alpha irrational, leading to the sum average of e^{2πi alpha u_k}. So in the specific problem, the user is considering the case where alpha=1/(2π) (to match e^{ik^2} = e^{2πi*(k^2/(2π))} ), so the assumptions would include that alpha=1/(2π) is irrational. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$ is irrational,\n$u_k = k^2$ for integers $k \\geq 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}e^{ik^2}=0. $$\n\nBut verifying that 1/(2π) is irrational is necessary, which it is because π is transcendental, hence irrational. So this is a valid assumption. Therefore, this should be the structured problem.",
