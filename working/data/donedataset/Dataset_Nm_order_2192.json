    "Content": "I have been stuck in this problem for some time now. Prove that $x^2+2$ and $x^2+x+4$ are irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}$. Also, prove further $\\mathbb Z_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2+1\\rangle$\n  and $\\mathbb Z_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2+x+4\\rangle$ are isomorphic, each\n  having $121$ elements. The first part is easy to prove since there is no element of $\\mathbb Z_{11}$ that satisfies either of the polynomials given in the question. However, proving that  $\\mathbb Z_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2+1\\rangle$ and $\\mathbb Z_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2+x+4\\rangle$ are isomorphic has been a challenge for me. How do I proceed? Moreover, how do I show that the the fields $\\mathbb {Z}_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2+1\\rangle$ and $\\mathbb {Z}_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2+x+4\\rangle$ each have $121$ elements?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user is asking to prove that two polynomial quotient rings over Z_11 are isomorphic fields. First, they mention proving that x²+1 and x²+x+4 are irreducible over Z_11, which they've already done by checking that there are no roots in Z_11. Then, they need to show the quotient fields are isomorphic and each has 121 elements.\n\nStarting with the assumptions. The problem states that we're working over Z_11, so the base ring is Z_11. Both polynomials x²+1 and x²+x+4 are given. Since the user mentioned they are irreducible, that's an assumption here. So the first assumption is that x²+1 is irreducible over Z_11. The second assumption is that x²+x+4 is irreducible over Z_11. Then, we need to consider the quotient rings Z_11[x]/⟨x²+1⟩ and Z_11[x]/⟨x²+x+4⟩. These are both fields because the polynomials are irreducible. The problem then is to show they are isomorphic. Additionally, the user wants confirmation that each has 121 elements, which probably comes from the fact that each element is a linear polynomial (degree less than 2) with coefficients in Z_11, so 11*11=121.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions x²+2 and x²+x+4 in the first part, but the title says x²+1 and x²+x+4. Let me check. The title says: \"Prove that the fields Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+1⟩ and Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+x+4⟩ are isomorphic\". But in the question, the user writes: \"Prove that x²+2 and x²+x+4 are irreducible...\". There's a discrepancy here. The title mentions x²+1 and x²+x+4, but the question body mentions x²+2 and x²+x+4. However, the user says \"the first part is easy to prove since there is no element of Z_11 that satisfies either of the polynomials given in the question.\" Wait, the problem in the title is about x²+1 and x²+x+4, but in the question body, they refer to x²+2 and x²+x+4. Is this a typo? Or perhaps the user made a mistake when writing the problem? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The title is about x²+1 and x²+x+4. The question starts by saying \"Prove that x²+2 and x²+x+4 are irreducible over Z_{11}.\" Then, the quotient fields are Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+1⟩ and Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+x+4⟩. Wait, this is confusing. There's a mix between x²+2 and x²+1. Maybe the user intended to have x²+1 in both cases but made a typo? Or perhaps the problem is correctly stated as in the title, and the user made a mistake in the question body.\n\nGiven that the title is the main source, I think the problem is about x²+1 and x²+x+4. But in the question body, the user talks about x²+2 and x²+x+4. This inconsistency needs to be addressed. However, since the user is asking for help, maybe they made a typo. Let me check again the original problem:\n\nTitle: Prove that the fields Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+1⟩ and Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+x+4⟩ are isomorphic.\n\nQuestion: ...Prove that x²+2 and x²+x+4 are irreducible over Z_{11}... However, proving that Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+1⟩ and Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+x+4⟩ are isomorphic...\n\nSo the user first mentions x²+2, but then the quotient is with x²+1. That's inconsistent. But maybe that's a typo. The problem might actually be about x²+1 and x²+x+4, both being irreducible. Alternatively, maybe the user intended x²+2 and x²+x+4, but the title is wrong. Since the problem as per the title is about x²+1 and x²+x+4, but the user mentions x²+2 in the question, this is conflicting. However, in the problem statement, the user says \"the first part is easy to prove since there is no element of Z_11 that satisfies either of the polynomials given in the question.\" So if the polynomials given in the question are x²+2 and x²+x+4, then perhaps the title is wrong. Alternatively, the user mixed up the polynomials.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. But as the assistant, I need to structure the problem based on the given input. The user provided both the title and the question. The title mentions x²+1 and x²+x+4, but the question mentions x²+2 and x²+x+4. The user is asking to structure the problem, filtering out unrelated information. The key is to extract the correct assumptions and problem from the given text.\n\nLooking at the user's question, they mention proving that x²+2 and x²+x+4 are irreducible. Then, they need to prove that the quotient rings Z_11[x]/⟨x²+1⟩ and Z_11[x]/⟨x²+x+4⟩ are isomorphic. There's a mismatch here. So perhaps the user intended the polynomials in the quotient rings to be x²+2 and x²+x+4, but the title has a typo. Alternatively, the title is correct, and the user made a mistake in the question body. \n\nBut since the user is confused and asking for help, perhaps the correct problem is as in the title, but they made a typo in the body. Alternatively, maybe they meant to write x²+1 in both places. Alternatively, the problem is correctly stated in the body, and the title is wrong. This is a bit of a problem. \n\nTo resolve this, since the title is \"Prove that the fields Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+1⟩ and Z_{11}[x]/⟨x²+x+4⟩ are isomorphic\", and the user in the question says \"Prove that x²+2 and x²+x+4 are irreducible over Z_{11}...\", but then the quotient fields are with x²+1 and x²+x+4. This seems like the user might have made a mistake. However, since the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem, perhaps the correct problem is as per the title, so the two polynomials are x²+1 and x²+x+4. The user may have mistakenly written x²+2 in the question body. Alternatively, the correct problem is with x²+2 and x²+x+4, but the title is wrong. But without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write x²+1 and x²+x+4 as the polynomials for the quotient fields, and x²+2 and x²+x+4 as the ones to check for irreducibility. But that seems inconsistent. However, in the question, the user says \"the first part is easy to prove since there is no element of Z_11 that satisfies either of the polynomials given in the question.\" So if the polynomials given in the question are x²+2 and x²+x+4, then those are the ones to check. Then, the quotient fields are Z_11[x]/⟨x²+1⟩ and Z_11[x]/⟨x²+x+4⟩. So that's inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended all four polynomials: in the title, the quotient fields are for x²+1 and x²+x+4; in the question body, they need to prove that x²+2 and x²+x+4 are irreducible. That seems like a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confused and there's a mix-up. To structure the problem correctly, perhaps we should take the polynomials as given in the title, since that's the main heading. Therefore, the problem is to prove that Z_11[x]/⟨x²+1⟩ and Z_11[x]/⟨x²+x+4⟩ are isomorphic, after showing that x²+1 and x²+x+4 are irreducible. However, in the question body, the user says they proved x²+2 and x²+x+4. So this is conflicting. \n\nGiven that the user is asking for help, perhaps the correct problem is as per the title, and the user made a typo in the question body. Therefore, the correct assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial $x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.\n- The polynomial $x^2 + x + 4$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.\nProblem:\nProve that the fields $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2 + 1 \\rangle$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2 + x + 4 \\rangle$ are isomorphic, each having 121 elements.\n\nHowever, the user mentions in the question body that they checked x²+2 and x²+x+4. So perhaps the problem should involve those. Alternatively, maybe the user intended x²+1 and x²+x+4, and the mention of x²+2 is a mistake. Given that the title is authoritative, I think we should go with the title's polynomials. Therefore, the assumptions are that both x²+1 and x²+x+4 are irreducible over Z_11. The problem is to prove the fields are isomorphic and that each has 121 elements. The user is confused about how to show isomorphism, and also asks about the number of elements. However, the example given by the user in their initial instruction had assumptions listed line by line. Here, the assumptions are two: irreducibility of each polynomial. The problem is to prove isomorphism and the size. But the user also asks about the number of elements, which is part of the problem statement. So perhaps the problem statement should include both parts: proving isomorphism and that each has 121 elements. \n\nBut according to the original problem's example, the problem line is concise. In the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem would be \"Prove that the fields ... are isomorphic, each having 121 elements.\" \n\nSo structuring the problem accordingly:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The polynomial $x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.\n- The polynomial $x^2 + x + 4$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.\nProblem:\nProve that the fields $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2 + 1 \\rangle$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2 + x + 4 \\rangle$ are isomorphic, each having 121 elements.\n\nBut wait, the original problem in the example included the assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the irreducibility is a given condition? Or is it part of the problem? The user says \"the first part is easy to prove since there is no element of Z_11 that satisfies either of the polynomials given in the question.\" So the user already proved irreducibility for x²+2 and x²+x+4, but is confused about the isomorphism part. However, in the title, the polynomials are x²+1 and x²+x+4. There's inconsistency. \n\nBut since the task is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format, perhaps we should take the problem as stated in the title and the first part of the question. The user mentions proving irreducibility for x²+2 and x²+x+4, then proving the isomorphism for x²+1 and x²+x+4. This seems contradictory. However, perhaps the correct problem is that the user needs to prove that x²+1 and x²+x+4 are irreducible (but in the question body, they say x²+2 and x²+x+4). This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the polynomials in the title are correct. So the problem is to show that x²+1 and x²+x+4 are irreducible (even though the user says x²+2 in the body), then show the quotient fields are isomorphic. To resolve this, perhaps the correct assumptions are the irreducibility of the two polynomials in the title, and the problem is to prove isomorphism. The user's mention of x²+2 is a mistake. \n\nGiven that, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial $x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.\n- The polynomial $x^2 + x + 4$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.\nProblem:\nProve that the fields $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2 + 1 \\rangle$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_{11}[x]/\\langle x^2 + x + 4 \\rangle$ are isomorphic, each having 121 elements.\n\nHowever, the user in their question mentions that they already checked x²+2 and x²+x+4. So maybe the correct problem is with x²+2 and x²+x+4. But the title is different. This is conflicting. Without more context, I have to assume that the title is correct, as it's the main heading. Therefore, proceed with the title's polynomials. The user may have made a typo in the body. Therefore, the assumptions are the irreducibility of x²+1 and x²+x+4, and the problem is to prove the isomorphism and the size. \n\nRegarding the number of elements: Each quotient ring modulo an irreducible polynomial of degree 2 over Z_11 will have 11^2 = 121 elements, since each element is represented by a linear polynomial (degree < 2), so coefficients a and b in Z_11, giving 11*11 elements. This is standard, so the user needs to confirm that, but it's straightforward. The main challenge is showing the fields are isomorphic. \n\nIn summary, after filtering the inconsistent parts (the mention of x²+2 in the body seems to be a typo), the structured problem should be based on the title and the correct polynomials.",
