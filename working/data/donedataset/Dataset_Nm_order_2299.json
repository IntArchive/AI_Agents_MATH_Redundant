    "Content": "I want to prove that surjectivity is stable under base change: if $f:X\\to S$ a surjective morphism of scheme and $\\varphi:T\\to S$ then $f_T:X\\times_S T\\to T$ is surjective. Idea 1: I know that for all $t\\in T$, $f_T^{-1}(t)\\simeq (X\\times_S T)\\times_T \\mathrm{Spec}(k(t))\\simeq X\\times_S \\mathrm{Spec}(k(t))$ and (for the same reason) with $s=\\varphi(t)$, $f^{-1}(s)\\simeq X\\times_S\\mathrm{Spec}(k(s))\\neq\\emptyset$. But how deduce that $X\\times_S \\mathrm{Spec}(k(t))\\neq\\emptyset$? Maybe as $k(t)\\simeq k(s)$ (topologically) so $\\mathrm{Spec}(k(t))\\twoheadrightarrow\\mathrm{Spec}(k(s))$ and so $X\\times_S \\mathrm{Spec}(k(t))\\twoheadrightarrow X\\times_S \\mathrm{Spec}(k(s))$? Idea 2: let $s=\\varphi(t)$ and $x\\in X$ so that $f(x)=s$ then $f(s)=\\varphi(t)$. In the purely set-theoretic construction of $X\\times_S T$ this would implicate the existence of $z\\in X\\times_S T$ with $f_T(z)=t$. But the fibred-product of scheme is not so built...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Following your Idea 1 it only remains to show $X\\times_S \\mathrm{Spec} (k(t))$ is non-empty. Let $s=\\varphi(t)$, then the above fiber product is also $X_s\\times_{\\mathrm{Spec}(k(s))} \\mathrm{Spec}(k(t))$. Take a non-empty affine open subset $U=\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ of $X_s$. It is enough to show $U\\times_{\\mathrm{Spec}(k(s))} \\mathrm{Spec}(k(t))$ is non-empty. The latter is an affine scheme given by $R\\otimes_{k(s)} k(t)$. As $R\\ne 0$, $R\\otimes_{k(s)} k(t)\\ne 0$ because we make a field extension (a vector basis of $R$ over $k(s)$ extends to a vector basis over $k(t)$). By Krull's theorem, $R\\otimes_{k(s)} k(t)$ has a maximal (hence prime) ideal, so \n$U\\times_{\\mathrm{Spec}(k(s))} \\mathrm{Spec}(k(t))\\ne\\emptyset$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants to prove that surjectivity is stable under base change in the context of schemes. So, given a surjective morphism of schemes f: X → S and another morphism φ: T → S, the base change f_T: X ×_S T → T should also be surjective. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions f is a surjective morphism of schemes. Then there's a base change with φ: T → S. The goal is to show f_T is surjective. The user has some ideas involving fibers and the construction of the fiber product.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed one per line, each about a single object or property. So here, the key assumptions are: f is a surjective morphism of schemes, φ is a morphism from T to S, and f_T is the base change morphism. Wait, but do I need to state that T is a scheme? Probably, since we're dealing with schemes. Also, surjectivity of f is given. The problem is to prove that f_T is surjective. \n\nThe user's first idea involves looking at fibers. For t in T, they consider f_T^{-1}(t) which is isomorphic to X ×_S Spec(k(t)) and relate it to f^{-1}(s) where s = φ(t). The second idea is more set-theoretic, but notes that the fiber product for schemes isn't built in the same way. \n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f: X → S is a surjective morphism of schemes.\n2. φ: T → S is a morphism of schemes.\n3. f_T: X ×_S T → T is the base change morphism.\n\nBut maybe we don't need to list f_T as an assumption since it's part of the problem statement. Wait, the problem is to prove that f_T is surjective given that f is surjective. So perhaps the assumptions are just f is surjective, and φ: T → S is given. Also, all objects are schemes. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n- X, S, T are schemes.\n- f: X → S is a surjective morphism.\n- φ: T → S is a morphism.\n- f_T: X ×_S T → T is the base change morphism obtained from f and φ.\n\nBut the original problem's example only lists the essential assumptions, not the ambient structures unless necessary. In the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → S is a surjective morphism of schemes,\nφ: T → S is a morphism of schemes,\nf_T is the morphism X ×_S T → T obtained by base change.\n\nBut maybe the key is that f is surjective, and the base change is along any φ. So the problem is to show that under these conditions, f_T is surjective.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → S is a surjective morphism of schemes,\nφ: T → S is a morphism of schemes.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the base change morphism f_T: X ×_S T → T is surjective.\n\nI think that's the core. The user's ideas are part of their attempt, but the problem statement needs to be distilled. The key assumptions are the surjectivity of f and that φ is a morphism. The rest (like the fiber product construction) is part of the problem setup but not assumptions. So yes, the assumptions are the surjective morphism f and the existence of φ. So, structuring accordingly.",
