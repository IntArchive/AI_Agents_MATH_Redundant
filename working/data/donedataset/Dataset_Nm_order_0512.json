    "Content": "I am learning abstract algebra by myself using Dummit & Foote, and sometimes by working very hard I find very complicated non-proofs of things and I have no idea if they are the best or the worst ideas for those kind of things out there (obviously if they're not working they're probably wrong, but maybe not!). So I feel like talking about it and see what the audience thinks about it. Hence I am asking for a full solution only if you don't feel like giving a hint. If a hint has been given please don't try to come up with the answer and wait for me to accept. So here's the exercise (page 259, Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra) : Let $R = C[0,1]$ with addition and multiplication as the ring operations. For each $c \\in [0,1]$ define $M_c = \\{ f \\in R \\, | \\, f(c) = 0 \\}$. It can be easily seen that $M_c$ is a maximal ideal of $R$ because $f(x) = (x-c) \\in M_c$ and if $g \\notin M_c$ then $g(c) \\neq 0$, thus $f^2 > 0$ everywhere except at $c$ and $g^2(c)> 0$, hence $f^2 + g^2$ is a strictly positive continuous function, and since any ideal $I$ such that $M_c \\subsetneq I \\triangleleft R$ is such that $(M_c,g) \\subseteq I$, $f^2 + g^2 \\in (M_c,g)$, thus $f^2 + g^2$ is a unit in $(M_c,g)$ and that means that for every $g \\notin M_c$, $R = (M_c, g) = I$. Using this trick with $f^2 + g^2$ I wanted to show the following : Prove that if $M$ is any maximal ideal of $R$ then there is a real number $c \\in [0,1]$ such that $M = M_c$. I tried considering $K(g) = \\{ c \\in [0,1] \\, | \\, g(c) = 0 \\}$ and then defining decreasing sequences $K(g) \\supsetneq K(g_1) \\supsetneq K(g_2) \\supseteq \\dots$ (using the $f^2 + g^2$ trick) and then looking at the intersection of all those $K$'s but that got me to the weird need of using Zorn's Lemma and got me depressed after multiple tries. Also tried to use the fact that $R/M_c$ is a field but even if I had shown that it was isomorphic to $\\mathbb R$ it wasn't clear what I could do in that direction so I gave up pretty fast on that one. Any hints are welcome!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You seem like you like intuition, so here's some. You are trying to prove something about a ring whose mere definition involves topology. Moreover, it's fairly obvious that this isn't true in general (i.e. you can find topological spaces $X$ for which $\\text{MaxSpec}(C(X;\\mathbb{R}))\\ne{\\mathfrak{m}_x:x\\in X}$). Thus, you clearly need to use some nontrivial fact about the topology of $[0,1]$. Do any spring naturally to mind? They should, considering precisely what you noticed about the \"$f^2+g^2$\" problem. Namely, what you can note is that if  $f$ doesn't vanish at $x$ on $[0,1]$ and $g$ doesn't vanish at $y$ on $[0,1]$ you can note by continuity that there exists neighborhoods $U,V$ of $x,y$ such that $f,g$ vanish nowhere on either. Aha! But then $f^2+g^2$ vanishes nowhere on $U\\cup V$! It seems plausible then that if we assume that we have found an ideal for which there exists no such $c$ (as in the problem) then making an analogous jump we should be able to construct a function $f_x$ for each $x\\in[0,1]$ for which $f_x$ doesn't vanish at $x$ and then consider $\\displaystyle \\sum_{x\\in X}f_x^2$ to get a non-vanishing function on $[0,1]$. But, being non-vanishing we have that it's invertible (to a continuous function) and so our ideal contains a unit, and so is all of $C[0,1]$, a contradiction! Of course, this makes no sense since we can't take the infinite\n sum of all those squared functions. But, if we were somehow able to pick a finite subcollection which still \"works\" we'd be golden. Topology sounding a little nicer right about now?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving that every maximal ideal in the ring C[0,1] (continuous functions on [0,1]) is of the form M_c, which is the set of functions vanishing at some point c in [0,1]. The original question mentions that they tried using decreasing sequences of sets K(g) and Zorn's Lemma but found it complicated. They want a hint or solution that doesn't involve Zorn's Lemma.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem is about maximal ideals in C[0,1]. So the key assumptions here are related to the structure of the ring and the properties of its ideals. Let's list them:\n\n1. R is the ring C[0,1] with addition and multiplication as operations.\n2. For each c in [0,1], M_c is defined as {f in R | f(c) = 0}, which is a maximal ideal.\n3. The goal is to show that any maximal ideal M of R must be equal to M_c for some c in [0,1].\n\nWait, the problem states that M_c is a maximal ideal, and the user wants to prove the converse: that every maximal ideal is of this form. So the main assumption here is that M is a maximal ideal of R. Also, the ring is commutative with unity since it's C[0,1]. The user tried using properties like constructing K(g) as the vanishing set and using decreasing sequences but ended up needing Zorn's Lemma. The problem wants a proof that avoids Zorn's Lemma, which is typically used for existence proofs involving maximal elements.\n\nSo, the key points to structure the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R = C[0,1] is the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1] with pointwise operations.\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- For each c ∈ [0,1], M_c = {f ∈ R | f(c) = 0} is a maximal ideal.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a real number c ∈ [0,1] such that M = M_c.\n\nWait, the original problem statement by the user is to show that any maximal ideal M is equal to some M_c. The example given by the user in their question's title mentions that the proof should not involve Zorn's Lemma, so that's an important condition. However, in the problem formatting example provided earlier, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the assumptions would include the properties of the ring and the maximal ideal. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted assumption lists n as integer and n divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the assumptions are about the structure of the ring and the maximal ideal. However, the user's own problem statement doesn't have additional conditions except that the proof shouldn't use Zorn's Lemma. But the format requires listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. R is the ring C[0,1] of continuous functions on the interval [0,1].\n2. The ring operations are pointwise addition and multiplication.\n3. M is a maximal ideal of R.\n4. For each c ∈ [0,1], M_c = {f ∈ R | f(c) = 0} is a maximal ideal.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that any maximal ideal is of the form M_c. So the fact that M_c is maximal is given as part of the problem setup, but the actual assumption for the problem to solve is that M is a maximal ideal. However, in the problem statement, the user is asked to prove that every maximal ideal M is equal to M_c for some c. So the assumptions would include that M is a maximal ideal, and the problem is to show that there exists c such that M = M_c.\n\nBut the user also mentions that M_c is already known to be maximal, which is part of the problem's context. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- R = C[0,1] with pointwise operations.\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- For each c ∈ [0,1], M_c is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists c ∈ [0,1] such that M = M_c.\n\nBut the user's own problem statement in the question is: \"Prove that if M is any maximal ideal of R then there is a real number c ∈ [0,1] such that M = M_c.\" So the problem is exactly that.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions would list each condition on the objects involved. Each line should address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nR is the ring of continuous functions on [0,1] with pointwise addition and multiplication,\nM is a maximal ideal of R,\nFor each c ∈ [0,1], M_c = {f ∈ R | f(c) = 0} is a maximal ideal.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a real number c ∈ [0,1] such that M = M_c.\n\nBut wait, the fact that M_c is maximal is given in the problem setup (as part of the original exercise from Dummit & Foote), so it's part of the assumptions. But in the problem the user is trying to solve, they have to show the converse: that every maximal ideal is one of those M_c. So the key assumption here is that M is a maximal ideal, and R is as defined.\n\nBut maybe the assumptions should be broken down as:\n\n- R = C[0,1], the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1] with pointwise operations.\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- For each c ∈ [0,1], M_c = {f ∈ R | f(c) = 0} is an ideal of R.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user already knows that M_c is maximal. But perhaps the problem is to show that all maximal ideals are of this form. So the problem's assumptions are that R is as given, M is a maximal ideal, and the problem is to show M is M_c for some c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions should include that M_c is a maximal ideal, but that might be part of the problem's setup rather than assumptions. However, in the example provided earlier, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the relevant assumptions would be about the ring and the maximal ideal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- Let R = C[0,1] be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1] with pointwise operations.\n- Let M be a maximal ideal of R.\n- For each c ∈ [0,1], the set M_c = {f ∈ R | f(c) = 0} is a maximal ideal.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists c ∈ [0,1] such that M = M_c.\n\nBut perhaps the fact that M_c is maximal is part of the problem's given, but in the user's original problem statement, they mention that \"it can be easily seen that M_c is a maximal ideal\", so that is part of the setup. But in the problem to solve, which is the converse, the assumption is that M is any maximal ideal, and the problem is to show it's equal to some M_c.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. R is the ring C[0,1] with pointwise operations.\n2. M is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nThe problem is to show that there exists c ∈ [0,1] such that M = M_c.\n\nBut perhaps also that M_c is maximal for each c. However, the user's problem is to show that all maximal ideals are of that form, so the existence of M_c as maximal ideals is part of the context but not an assumption for the problem itself. The problem is about any maximal ideal M, not necessarily given as M_c.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured as follows. The user knows that each M_c is a maximal ideal, and wants to show that every maximal ideal is one of these. So the problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- R = C[0,1] with pointwise addition and multiplication.\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n- For each c ∈ [0,1], M_c is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nBut the problem is to show that M must be one of the M_c. So the assumptions are R and M, and the problem is to find c such that M = M_c.\n\nAlternatively, the fact that M_c is maximal might not be an assumption of the problem to be solved, but part of the problem's background. However, in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the problem was to show divisibility by 91. So in that case, the assumption was part of the problem's setup.\n\nIn this case, the problem is to show that every maximal ideal is of the form M_c. So the key assumption is that M is a maximal ideal, and R is C[0,1]. The fact that M_c is maximal might be considered part of the problem's context but not an assumption needed for the problem's solution. Therefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\nR is the ring of continuous functions on [0,1] with pointwise operations,\nM is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a real number c ∈ [0,1] such that M = M_c.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions that M_c is a maximal ideal, so perhaps that is part of the problem's given information, so the assumptions should include that M_c is a maximal ideal. However, the problem is to show the converse: that all maximal ideals are M_c. Hence, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- R = C[0,1] with pointwise addition and multiplication.\n- For each c ∈ [0,1], M_c = {f ∈ R | f(c) = 0} is a maximal ideal.\n- M is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nProblem: Prove that M = M_c for some c ∈ [0,1].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions only include the ring structure and M being maximal, while the fact that M_c is maximal is part of the problem's known results but not listed as an assumption. However, since the example included assumptions that were part of the problem's setup, perhaps here the fact that M is a maximal ideal and R is C[0,1] are the key assumptions. The problem is to show that such an M must be equal to some M_c. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is the ring of continuous functions on [0,1] with pointwise addition and multiplication,\nM is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a real number c ∈ [0,1] such that M = M_c.\n\nBut in the original problem statement by the user, they mention that M_c is maximal. So perhaps in the context of the problem from Dummit & Foote, the problem is given after knowing that M_c are maximal ideals, and now the exercise is to prove that all maximal ideals are of this form. Hence, the assumption that M is a maximal ideal is given, and the problem is to show it's some M_c.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nR = C[0,1] with addition and multiplication as the ring operations,\nM is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a real number c ∈ [0,1] such that M = M_c.\n\nThat's probably the correct way to structure it, as the key assumptions are the ring structure and M being maximal. The fact that M_c is maximal is part of the problem's background knowledge but not an assumption needed for the proof. The problem is to show that any maximal ideal M must coincide with some M_c.",
