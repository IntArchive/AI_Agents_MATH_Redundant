    "Content": "Show that $\\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ is not a cyclic group. This question is from the book 'Of Abstract Algebra' by Pinter. Now $\\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ containt 8 elements. I found them to be as follows:\n$$(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)$$\nNow if $\\mathbb{Z}_{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ were cyclic, one of these elements should be a generator of the entire group. However, for every element listed we find that repeated repetitions of the group operation yields the identity element already before having to apply the group operation eight times. Therefore, using any of these elements as a single element would result in a subgroup of order less than 8, in this case it will have either order 4, order 2 or order 1. Therefore the group is not cyclic. Now I am quite sure this constitutes a correct proof but I am wondering if a more elegant way exist to show this result. This might be especially useful when investigating similar questions for much larger groups. Thanks in advance P.S. I have been posting more questions from this book because I find them very interesting, but I am reading it on my own so I am sometimes unsure if the methods I use are the most elegant and quick. So far I have received great help and I am grateful to the stackexchange community for this :)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think your approach of studying the order of the elements is the right one. If you want to do that in a more systematic way, you may study order of elements in a direct product. Namely, say we have $G_1, \\ldots, G_r$ some groups, some element $g = (g_1, \\ldots g_r) \\in G_1 \\times \\ldots \\times G_r$ in the direct product, and we want to know the order of $g$ inside $G_1 \\times \\ldots \\times G_r$. It turns out that if $n_i$ denotes the order $g_i \\in G_i$, then the order of $g$ is $\\operatorname{lcm}(n_1,\\ldots,n_r)$. In particular, since the order $g_i$ divides $|G_i|$ (the number of elements of the group), then order of $g$ divides $\\operatorname{lcm}(|G_1|,\\ldots,|G_r|)$. In your example, take $G_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_4$. We know the order of any element inside $G_1 \\times G_2$ divides $\\operatorname{lcm}(|G_1|,|G_2|) = \\operatorname{lcm}(2,4) = 4$. So there is no element of order $8$. Using the same principle we may see for example that $ \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times  \\mathbb{Z}_3$ is cyclic. Indeed, we know $(1,1)$ has order $\\operatorname{lcm}(2,3)= 6$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to identify the assumptions in the problem. The original question is asking to show that the group ℤ₂ × ℤ₄ is not cyclic. \n\nLooking at the problem, the key points are about the group structure. The group in question is the direct product of ℤ₂ and ℤ₄. The assumptions here would be about the properties of this group and the elements within it. Let me list them one by one.\n\nFirst, the group is ℤ₂ × ℤ₄. Each component of the direct product is a cyclic group: ℤ₂ and ℤ₄. The elements of the group are ordered pairs where the first component is from ℤ₂ and the second from ℤ₄. The operation is component-wise addition modulo 2 and 4, respectively. \n\nThe problem states that this group isn't cyclic. To show that, one approach is to check if there's an element with the same order as the group, which is 8. If all elements have orders less than 8, then the group can't be cyclic. Alternatively, we can use the theorem that a direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if their orders are coprime. Here, the orders of ℤ₂ and ℤ₄ are 2 and 4, which have a gcd of 2, not 1. Hence, their product isn't cyclic. But the original proof provided by the user checks each element's order.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be about the group's structure: it's a direct product of ℤ₂ and ℤ₄, each of which is cyclic. The problem is to show this product isn't cyclic. \n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions included specific conditions applied to one object each. Here, the group itself is the object. Let me think. The problem doesn't have any extra conditions beyond the group being ℤ₂ × ℤ₄. Therefore, the main assumption is the group in question. But the example had assumptions listed as properties applied to the object. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The group is ℤ₂ × ℤ₄.\n\nBut in the example, they listed assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is about the group, so perhaps the assumption is that the group in question is the direct product of ℤ₂ and ℤ₄. But the problem itself is to show it's not cyclic, which is the main task. Wait, maybe the problem is just the statement to prove, and the assumptions are the given structures. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user formatted the assumptions as n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted version, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Let me check again.\n\nWait the original problem in the example says: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error, because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version restricts n to being divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example, but maybe the user intended to filter some conditions. Hmm. But perhaps I should focus on the current problem.\n\nThe current problem is to show that ℤ₂ × ℤ₄ is not cyclic. The assumptions here would be the properties of the group. Since the group is given as ℤ₂ × ℤ₄, the assumption is that we're working with this specific group. But in the example, they broke down assumptions into individual conditions. So maybe here, the assumptions are:\n\n- The group is ℤ₂ × ℤ₄.\n- The group operation is component-wise addition modulo 2 and 4.\n\nBut maybe the component-wise operation is part of the definition of the direct product, so perhaps it's inherent. Alternatively, maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- ℤ₂ is a cyclic group of order 2.\n- ℤ₄ is a cyclic group of order 4.\n- The group in question is the direct product of ℤ₂ and ℤ₄.\n\nBut the problem is to show this group isn't cyclic. So the problem is straightforward. The user is asking for a more elegant proof than checking each element's order. The standard theorem is that the direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if their orders are coprime. Here, 2 and 4 are not coprime (gcd(2,4)=2), so the product isn't cyclic. But maybe the user wants that approach.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user already mentioned their approach and is seeking a more elegant method. Therefore, the problem as per the format should capture the core question without the user's specific approach. The original problem is to show that ℤ₂ × ℤ₄ is not cyclic, so the formatted version should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group is ℤ₂ × ℤ₄.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the group is not cyclic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down the group's components as separate assumptions. Let me think. The problem is about the group ℤ₂ × ℤ₄. The assumptions are:\n\n- The group under consideration is the direct product of ℤ₂ and ℤ₄.\n- ℤ₂ is a cyclic group of order 2.\n- ℤ₄ is a cyclic group of order 4.\n\nBut maybe the problem can be structured with the group as given, so the main assumption is that the group is ℤ₂ × ℤ₄. Then the problem is to show it's not cyclic. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which seems contradictory. Perhaps the example has a mistake, but maybe the key is that the user in the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem? Wait, in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted version, it adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the format instructions given.\n\nThe task says to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So for the current problem, the key assumptions are the group's structure. The problem is to show it's not cyclic. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group is ℤ₂ × ℤ₄.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the group is not cyclic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps breaking down the group's components as separate assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group is the direct product of ℤ₂ and ℤ₄.\nℤ₂ is a cyclic group of order 2.\nℤ₄ is a cyclic group of order 4.\n\nBut maybe that's redundant because the direct product already implies the components. The problem is to show the product isn't cyclic. The key property here is that the orders are not coprime. So the main assumption is that the group is ℤ₂ × ℤ₄. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group is ℤ₂ × ℤ₄.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the group is not cyclic.\n\nBut perhaps to be more precise, since the direct product is of two cyclic groups, we can mention that:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group is the direct product of ℤ₂ and ℤ₄.\nℤ₂ is a cyclic group.\nℤ₄ is a cyclic group.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were listed as properties applied to one object each. In the example, the problem was about A(n), and assumptions were about n. So here, the group is the object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nG = ℤ₂ × ℤ₄,\nG is a group under component-wise addition.\n\nBut maybe component-wise addition is part of the definition of the direct product. Alternatively, the problem might not need to state that. So the main assumption is that the group in question is the direct product of ℤ₂ and ℤ₄. Then the problem is to show it's not cyclic. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group is ℤ₂ × ℤ₄.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the group is not cyclic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to note that ℤ₂ and ℤ₄ are cyclic groups. But the problem is about their direct product. The key point is that their orders are not coprime. However, the user's original question didn't mention that theorem, so maybe the problem is to be presented without assuming that theorem, hence needing to show it directly.\n\nIn any case, following the example's format, where the original problem was restructured with assumptions and the problem, here the assumptions would list the properties of the group. The problem is to show it's not cyclic.
