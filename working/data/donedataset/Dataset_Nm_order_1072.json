    "Content": "I'm working through some Hartshorne problems and have noticed that in order to do certain problems properly one must prove a given polynomial $f\\in k[x,y]$ is irreducible. For example, in problem I.5.1(b) we are studying the polynomial $f=xy-x^6-y^6$. How can I show this is irreducible? The standard tricks (Eisenstein, linearity in one variable, etc...) don't seem to work here. Edit: Some of the other polynomials in the problem are also giving me trouble. They are $g=x^3-y^2-x^4-y^4$ and $h=x^2y+xy^2-x^4-y^4$. Any ideas for these?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume $k$ is algebraically closed. Let $F = k((x))$. Consider the polynomial $g = xy - y^6$. Because $$g \\equiv f \\mod x^6 $$ then over $F$, factorization of $g$ should approximate the factorization of $f$. The factorization of $g$ is $$ g = y (x - y^5) $$ This is easy to check because its splitting field $E = F(x^{1/5})$ satisfies $[E : F] = 5$. The six roots of $g$ are $y=0$ and $y=\\zeta^k x^{1/5}$ where $\\zeta$ is a fifth root of unity. (if $k$ has characteristic $5$, then instead $x^{1/5}$ is a root with multiplicity 5) Now observe $$ f(x, x^{1/5}) \\equiv g(x, x^{1/5}) = 0 \\mod (x^{1/5})^{30} $$ and by Hensel's Lemma / Newton's algorithm, we can lift $x^{1/5}$ to an actual root $\\alpha$ of $f$ in $E$ with leading term $x^{1/5}$; therefore $F(\\alpha) = E$. (This might not work in characteristic 5; I haven't checked in detail) Therefore, we conclude that $f$ has an irreducible factor of degree $5$ over $F$. Therefore if $f$ were reducible over $k(x)$, then the only possibility is that it has an irreducible degree $5$ factor and a root. By inspection, we can see that such a root has to be $x^5$ plus higher powers of $x$, and from there it's easy to see that said root can't exist. Thus $f$, as a polynomial in $y$ over $k[x]$, is irreducible and has content $1$. Therefore $f$ is irreducible in $k[x,y]$. Now consider $k$ not algebraically closed, then the fact $f$ is irreducible over $\\bar{k}[x,y]$ implies it is also irreducible over $k[x,y]$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the polynomial f = xy - x^6 - y^6 is irreducible in k[x,y]. They mentioned that standard methods like Eisenstein or checking linearity in one variable aren't working. Also, there are two other polynomials g and h mentioned, but the main focus seems to be on f first.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a polynomial in two variables to be irreducible. A polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials. So, if we can show that f doesn't factor into such a product, then it's irreducible.\n\nStandard approaches for one variable don't directly apply here. Eisenstein's criterion, for example, is typically used in one variable with a prime ideal. Maybe we can try to use some substitution or view the polynomial in one variable by fixing the other. Let's see.\n\nLooking at f = xy - x^6 - y^6. Suppose, for contradiction, that f factors as f = A * B, where A and B are non-constant polynomials in k[x,y]. Then, the degrees of A and B must add up to the degree of f, which is 6. Let's consider the degrees. The total degree of f is 6 (from x^6 and y^6 terms). If f factors into A and B, then the total degrees of A and B must sum to 6. So possible degrees could be 1 and 5, 2 and 4, 3 and 3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the polynomial modulo some ideal could help. For example, if we can reduce f modulo some prime or polynomial and show that it remains irreducible under that reduction, then maybe we can conclude. Alternatively, maybe using the Newton polygon method? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that if a polynomial is irreducible when viewed as a polynomial in one variable with coefficients in the other variable's field, then it's irreducible. For example, consider f as a polynomial in x with coefficients in k[y]. If we can show that f is irreducible in k(y)[x], then it would be irreducible in k[x,y]. To check irreducibility over k(y)[x], we could use Eisenstein's criterion if there's a suitable prime element in k[y] that divides all coefficients except the leading one and doesn't divide the constant term, etc. Let's try that.\n\nBut f(x) = -x^6 + xy - y^6. Let's write it as -x^6 + yx - y^6. If we consider this as a polynomial in x over k(y), the coefficients are in k(y). The leading term is -x^6, then the next term is yx, and the constant term is -y^6. Eisenstein might not directly apply here because we need a prime element in k[y] that divides all coefficients except the leading one. The coefficients here are: coefficient of x^6 is -1, coefficient of x is y, and the constant term is -y^6. The only non-constant coefficient is y and -y^6. But Eisenstein requires a prime that divides the lower coefficients but not the leading one, and whose square doesn't divide the constant term. However, the coefficient of x^6 is -1, which is a unit in k[y], so Eisenstein might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trying to factor f as a product of two polynomials. Suppose f = A*B. Let's consider the degrees in x and y. Let me see. If A is a polynomial of degree m in x and n in y, and B is degree p in x and q in y, then m + p = 6 (total degree in x) and n + q = 6 (total degree in y). But also, the cross term xy must come from the product of terms in A and B. This could get complicated, but maybe considering possible factorizations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set y = x and check if the resulting polynomial in x is irreducible. If substituting y = x gives a polynomial that's irreducible, then maybe f is irreducible. Let's try that. Substituting y = x, we get f(x,x) = x^2 - x^6 - x^6 = x^2 - 2x^6 = x^2(1 - 2x^4). This factors, but that doesn't necessarily mean f is reducible. It's possible for an irreducible polynomial to factor when substituting a variable. So this might not help.\n\nAnother idea is to use the fact that if f is reducible, then so is its homogenization. Homogenizing f with a new variable z: F = xy - x^6 - y^6. Wait, homogenizing to degree 6: each term should be degree 6. The term xy is degree 2, so multiply by z^4: xy z^4 - x^6 - y^6. Then if F factors into two homogeneous polynomials, that would correspond to a factorization of f. Maybe checking the homogenized form can help. If F is irreducible, then so is f.\n\nSuppose F = (a x^a y^b z^c + ...)(d x^d y^e z^f + ...). Each factor must be homogeneous. The total degrees of the factors would add up to 6. For example, if one factor is linear (degree 1), then the other would be degree 5. But linear homogeneous polynomials in three variables would be like ax + by + cz. If F had a linear factor, then setting that factor to zero would give a plane that intersects the curve F=0 in infinitely many points. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, check for singularities. If the curve defined by F=0 has singular points, maybe that could indicate reducibility. But an irreducible curve can have singular points too.\n\nWait, another approach is to use the Newton polytope. The Newton polytope of f is the convex hull of the exponents. For f = xy -x^6 -y^6, the exponents are (1,1), (6,0), (0,6). The convex hull is a triangle with vertices at these points. If the polynomial is reducible, then its Newton polytope is the Minkowski sum of the Newton polytopes of its factors. So, if we can show that this triangle cannot be expressed as a Minkowski sum of two smaller polytopes, then f is irreducible. However, I'm not sure about the details here. Maybe this is too advanced.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that f factors as a product of two polynomials A and B. Then, each of A and B must have terms whose degrees add up to 6. Let's suppose A is of degree d in x and e in y, and B is degree f in x and g in y, such that d + f = 6 and e + g = 6. But also, the terms in A and B when multiplied should give the terms in f. Let's think about the possible factors.\n\nSuppose one of the factors is linear. Then, without loss of generality, say A is linear in x and y: A = a x + b y + c. But since f has no constant term (if we consider c=0?), but f does have a constant term in x or y. Wait, f is xy -x^6 - y^6. If A is linear, then B must have degree 5 in x and y. But multiplying A*B would give terms of degree 6. Let's see. Suppose A is linear, like a x + b y + c. Then when multiplied by B (degree 5), we get terms like a x * (terms of degree 5) which would give degree 6 terms. However, in f, the only degree 6 terms are -x^6 and -y^6. So if A is linear, then the leading terms of B must be such that when multiplied by A's linear term, they produce -x^6 and -y^6. For example, if A has a term x, then B must have a term -x^5 to get -x^6. Similarly, if A has a term y, B must have a term -y^5. But then, the cross term xy in f would have to come from the product of the linear terms. Suppose A = x + ... and B = -x^5 + ... Then when you multiply (x)(-x^5) = -x^6. Similarly, if A has a y term, but then there would be a term -y^6 from (y)(-y^5). However, the middle term xy must come from some product. For example, if A = x + a y + ... and B = -x^5 + b y^5 + ..., then when you multiply them, the cross term would be x*(b y^5) + a y*(-x^5) = b x y^5 - a x^5 y. But in f, there's only a term xy, not higher degree terms. So this seems impossible because the cross terms here would be degree 6 (like x y^5 or x^5 y), but f has a term xy which is degree 2. Therefore, the assumption of a linear factor leads to a contradiction because we can't get the xy term without introducing higher degree terms which aren't present. Thus, there can be no linear factors.\n\nSimilarly, suppose the polynomial factors into two quadratics. Let's say A is degree 2 and B is degree 4. Then, the product A*B would have terms up to degree 6. But again, the problem is generating the xy term. Let's try. Suppose A is a quadratic in x and y: A = a x^2 + b x y + c y^2 + d x + e y + f. Similarly for B. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the factors are homogeneous. If f is homogeneous, but it's not. The term xy is degree 2, while x^6 and y^6 are degree 6. Wait, f is not homogeneous. So maybe considering homogeneous components. But f is the sum of a degree 2 term and two degree 6 terms. If we try to factor f, then the product of two polynomials would have terms of various degrees. For example, if A has a constant term (degree 0), then multiplying by B would give terms of degree equal to B's degree. But f has no constant term. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split f into the sum of two parts: xy - (x^6 + y^6). Suppose that this factors as (something)(something else). Suppose we assume that one of the factors includes the xy term. For example, maybe A = xy + ... and B = 1 + ..., but then multiplying them would give a term xy*1, which is xy, but also other terms. But then we have to cancel out the x^6 and y^6 terms somehow. This seems tricky.\n\nAnother approach is to use the substitution method. Let's set x = y. Then f becomes x^2 - 2x^6 = x^2(1 - 2x^4). This factors, but as mentioned before, this doesn't necessarily mean the original polynomial is reducible. However, if the substitution leads to a reducible polynomial, the original might still be irreducible. So this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, set one variable to a constant. For example, set y = 1. Then f becomes x(1) - x^6 - 1 = -x^6 + x - 1. If this polynomial is irreducible over k, then f is irreducible in k[x,y]. Let's check. For example, over the rationals, does -x^6 +x -1 factor? Using rational root theorem, possible roots are x=1 or x=-1. Testing x=1: -1 +1 -1 = -1 ≠0. x=-1: -1 -1 -1 = -3 ≠0. So no linear factors. Maybe it factors into quadratics or cubics. Suppose it factors as (-x^6 +x -1) = (x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c)(-x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f). Multiplying these gives -x^6 + (d -a)x^5 + (e - a d + b)x^4 + (f - a e + b d - c)x^3 + (-a f + b e + c d)x^2 + (b f + c e)x + c f. Setting this equal to -x^6 +0x^5 +0x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +1x -1. So we get equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x^5: d - a = 0 ⇒ d = a\n2. Coefficient of x^4: e - a d + b = 0. But d = a, so e - a^2 + b = 0\n3. Coefficient of x^3: f - a e + b d - c = 0. With d=a, this is f -a e +a b -c =0\n4. Coefficient of x^2: -a f + b e + c d =0. With d=a, this is -a f +b e +c a =0\n5. Coefficient of x: b f + c e =1\n6. Constant term: c f = -1\n\nThis system seems complicated, but maybe assuming a=0. Let's try a=0. Then d=0.\n\nThen equation 2: e -0 +b =0 ⇒ e = -b\n\nEquation 3: f -0 +0 -c =0 ⇒ f -c =0 ⇒ f = c\n\nEquation 4: -0 +b e +0 =0 ⇒ b e =0. But e = -b, so b*(-b)=0 ⇒ -b²=0 ⇒ b=0\n\nIf b=0, then e = -0=0\n\nEquation 5: b f + c e =0*f +c*0=0=1, which is impossible. So a=0 doesn't work.\n\nTry a=1, so d=1\n\nEquation 2: e -1 +b =0 ⇒ e =1 -b\n\nEquation 3: f -1*e +1*b -c =0 ⇒ f -e +b -c =0. Substitute e=1 -b: f - (1 -b) +b -c = f -1 +b +b -c = f +2b -c -1 =0 ⇒ f = 1 -2b +c\n\nEquation 4: -1*f +b*e +c*1 =0 ⇒ -f +b*(1 -b) +c =0. Substitute f from above: -(1 -2b +c) +b -b² +c = -1 +2b -c +b -b² +c = -1 +3b -b² =0 ⇒ b² -3b +1=0 ⇒ b=(3±√5)/2. Not rational, so if k is not containing √5, then no solution.\n\nEquation 5: b f +c e =1. Substitute f=1 -2b +c and e=1 -b: b*(1 -2b +c) +c*(1 -b) = b -2b² +b c +c -b c = b -2b² +c =1\n\nFrom equation 6: c f = -1. Substitute f=1 -2b +c: c*(1 -2b +c) =-1 ⇒ c -2b c +c² = -1. But this is getting too complicated with non-rational b. So likely, there is no factorization over Q. Therefore, -x^6 +x -1 is irreducible over Q, implying that f is irreducible over Q[x,y]. But the original problem is over a general field k. Wait, in Hartshorne, the field k is usually algebraically closed, but the problem just says k[x,y]. So maybe if k is algebraically closed, this method might not work because over an algebraically closed field, the polynomial -x^6 +x -1 might factor. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, suppose k is algebraically closed. Then, the polynomial -x^6 +x -1 might have roots, but it's degree 6, and maybe it factors into irreducibles of lower degree. However, even if it factors, that doesn't necessarily mean the original f factors. Because setting y=1 is a specialization, which can preserve irreducibility only in certain cases. So this line of reasoning might not be sufficient.\n\nAnother approach: Use the Eisenstein's criterion in k[y][x]. To apply Eisenstein, we need a prime element in k[y] that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and whose square doesn't divide the constant term. Let's write f as a polynomial in x: f = -x^6 + y x - y^6. The coefficients are: leading coefficient -1 (a unit), coefficient of x is y, and the constant term is -y^6. If we can find a prime element p(y) that divides y and y^6 but p^2 doesn't divide y^6. The prime element could be y itself. Check: p(y)=y. Then y divides the coefficient of x (which is y) and the constant term -y^6. But y divides the leading coefficient? The leading coefficient is -1, which is not divisible by y. So Eisenstein applies if the leading coefficient is not divisible by p, which is the case here. But Eisenstein requires that p divides all coefficients except the leading one. In this case, the coefficients are: degree 6: -1, degree 1: y, degree 0: -y^6. So p=y divides the coefficients of degree 1 and 0, but not the leading coefficient (which is -1). Additionally, p^2 = y^2 does not divide the constant term -y^6. Wait, y^2 divides y^6 (since y^6 = y^2 * y^4), so Eisenstein's condition fails here. Because the requirement is that p^2 does not divide the constant term. But y^2 does divide y^6. Therefore, Eisenstein's criterion cannot be applied here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a substitution to transform the polynomial into a form where Eisenstein applies. For example, set x = z + y^k for some k. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Since f is symmetric in x and y (if we swap x and y, we get the same polynomial up to sign? Wait, f(x,y)=xy -x^6 -y^6, which is not symmetric, because swapping x and y gives yx - y^6 -x^6 = same as f. So f is symmetric. So any factorization would have to respect this symmetry. Suppose f = A*B, then either A and B are both symmetric, or one is the swap of the other. Hmm, but this might not necessarily hold.\n\nIf f factors as A*B, then considering the symmetry, maybe A is symmetric and B is as well, or they are swapped. Suppose A is symmetric. Then, for example, A could be of the form x^k + y^k + ... or something. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider the degrees of the factors. Since f has total degree 6, the factors must have degrees adding to 6. Suppose f factors into two cubics. Then each cubic would have terms up to degree 3. Let's attempt to write f as a product of two cubics:\n\nSuppose f = (a x^3 + b x^2 y + c x y^2 + d y^3 + e x^2 + f x y + g y^2 + h x + i y + j)(m x^3 + n x^2 y + o x y^2 + p y^3 + q x^2 + r x y + s y^2 + t x + u y + v)\n\nBut this seems very complicated. However, maybe the homogeneous components must match. The highest degree terms in f are -x^6 - y^6 + xy. When multiplying two cubics, the highest degree terms would be x^3 * x^3 = x^6, y^3 * y^3 = y^6, and cross terms. So the leading terms of the factors must produce -x^6 and -y^6. Suppose one factor has leading term x^3 and the other has leading term -x^3. Similarly for y^3. But this would produce -x^6. Similarly for y^6. But then, the cross terms when multiplying would give other degree 6 terms, which are not present in f. For example, if A has x^3 and B has -x^3, then the product has -x^6, but also other terms like x^3 * (other terms in B) would give higher degree terms, but f doesn't have those. Similarly, the term xy must come from the product of lower-degree terms. This seems impossible because to get xy as a term in the product, you would need, for example, a term x in A and a term y in B, but then multiplying those would give xy, but also other terms. However, in the product of two cubics, the term xy would be part of the degree 2 terms, but in our case, xy is a term of degree 2 in f. Wait, f has degree 6 terms and a degree 2 term. So when multiplying two cubics (each of degree 3), their product would have terms up to degree 6. The term xy is degree 2, so in the product, it would come from the product of a degree 1 term in A and a degree 1 term in B. But if A and B are cubics, they might have lower-degree terms. For example, suppose A has a term l x + m y and B has a term p x + q y, then multiplying those gives l p x^2 + (l q + m p) x y + m q y^2. So to get the xy term in f, which is 1*xy, the coefficients must satisfy l q + m p =1. But at the same time, the higher-degree terms must cancel out. However, the product would also have x^6 from x^3 * x^3 and y^6 from y^3 * y^3, which are present in f as -x^6 - y^6. So if we set the leading terms of A and B to be x^3 and -x^3, then x^3 * (-x^3) = -x^6. Similarly for y^3 * y^3. But then, we need to ensure that all other degree 6 terms cancel out. This seems very restrictive. For example, suppose A = x^3 + ... and B = -x^3 + ..., then multiplying them would give -x^6 plus other terms. But f only has -x^6 and -y^6 as degree 6 terms, so any other degree 6 terms from the product must cancel out. This would require careful balancing, which might not be possible.\n\nGiven all these attempts and the fact that none of the standard methods seem to work, maybe a better approach is to use the general fact that if a polynomial in two variables cannot be factored except by introducing extra terms that aren't present, then it's irreducible. But I need a more concrete argument.\n\nWait, here's another idea: Use the criterion that if f is irreducible in k[x][y], then it's irreducible in k[x,y]. Let's view f as a polynomial in y with coefficients in k[x]. So f(y) = -y^6 + x y -x^6. If we can show this is irreducible in k[x][y], then we're done. To check irreducibility over k[x][y], which is a UFD, we can use the Eisenstein's criterion. Let's see. The coefficients are in k[x]. The polynomial is -y^6 + x y -x^6. Let's write it as -y^6 + x y -x^6. Suppose we treat x as a variable over the field k(x). Wait, no, we're working in k[x][y], so coefficients are polynomials in x. The leading term is -1 in y^6. To apply Eisenstein, we need a prime element in k[x] that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and whose square doesn't divide the constant term.\n\nThe coefficients of f(y) are:\n- Leading term (y^6): coefficient -1 (unit in k[x])\n- y term: coefficient x\n- Constant term: -x^6\n\nSo the coefficients other than the leading term are x and -x^6. If we take the prime element p = x in k[x], then p divides x and x^6. However, p^2 = x^2 divides x^6 (since x^6 = x^2 * x^4). Therefore, Eisenstein's condition fails because p^2 divides the constant term. Hence, Eisenstein doesn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, try a substitution. Let’s set z = y + a x^k for some a and k to eliminate some terms. For example, maybe set y = z + x^m. Then substitute into f:\n\nf = x(z + x^m) -x^6 - (z + x^m)^6.\n\nExpanding this might create cross terms that can be canceled or managed. However, expanding (z + x^m)^6 would result in many terms, which might not help.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that f is weighted homogeneous. Assign weights to x and y such that the degrees of the terms match. For example, if we give x weight a and y weight b, then xy has weight a + b, x^6 has weight 6a, y^6 has weight 6b. To make these equal: a + b = 6a = 6b. From 6a = 6b ⇒ a = b. Then a + a = 6a ⇒ 2a =6a ⇒ a=0, which is trivial. So not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Suppose f factors as f = A * B, where A and B are non-constant. Then, setting A = 0 or B = 0 defines a curve in the plane. The intersection of these curves would have to include the curve f=0. But I'm not sure how to use this.\n\nAlternatively, use Bezout's theorem. If f= A*B, then the curves A=0 and B=0 intersect in points whose number is the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity. But Bezout's theorem applies to projective curves, so maybe homogenize f. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem in Hartshorne I.5.1(b), which involves showing that the curve defined by f=0 is irreducible. To do this, one needs to show f is irreducible. The fact that Hartshorne asks this suggests that there's a method using basic algebraic geometry, but since the user is stuck, maybe there's a trick.\n\nHere's a possible method: Use the fact that if the polynomial f is absolutely irreducible (i.e., irreducible over the algebraic closure of k), then it's irreducible over k. So we can assume k is algebraically closed. Now, suppose f factors as f = A*B. Then, the curves A=0 and B=0 must intersect. The intersection points would satisfy A=B=0, so f=0. But since f=0 is the union of the two curves, their intersection would be along a common component. However, since f has no multiple factors (if it did, we could check by taking the derivative), but assuming k has characteristic not dividing 6, the derivatives df/dx = y -6x^5 and df/dy = x -6y^5. If there were a common factor, then the derivatives would share that factor. Suppose there's a common factor D. Then D divides f, df/dx, and df/dy. Let's check if f and df/dx have a common factor. Suppose D divides f and df/dx. Then D divides y -6x^5 and also divides f = xy -x^6 -y^6. Let's compute the resultant or use elimination. From D divides y -6x^5, we can express y =6x^5. Substitute into f: x*(6x^5) -x^6 - (6x^5)^6 =6x^6 -x^6 -6^6 x^{30}=5x^6 -6^6 x^{30}. This must be zero for all x, which is not possible unless D is a constant. Hence, f and its derivatives have no common factors, so f is square-free. Thus, if f factors, it must be into distinct irreducible factors. But this doesn't directly answer the question.\n\nAnother angle: Use the genus of the curve. If the curve defined by f=0 has genus ≥1, then it's irreducible. But computing the genus is non-trivial and might not be expected here.\n\nAlternatively, consider the projective closure of the curve. Homogenize f with a new variable z: F = xy z^4 -x^6 -y^6 =0. Then, check for singular points at infinity. Setting z=0, the equation becomes -x^6 -y^6 =0 ⇒ x^6 + y^6 =0. In characteristic not 2, this gives x=ζ y where ζ^6 =-1. Each such point (ζ:1:0) is a point at infinity. Check if these points are singular. Compute partial derivatives:\n\nF_x = y z^4 -6x^5\n\nF_y = x z^4 -6y^5\n\nF_z =4xy z^3\n\nAt z=0, x^6 + y^6 =0. Let’s take a point (ζ:1:0). Compute F_x at this point: y z^4 -6x^5 =1*0 -6(ζ)^5= -6ζ^5\n\nF_y: x z^4 -6y^5 =ζ*0 -6*1= -6\n\nF_z:4xy z^3=4ζ*1*0=0\n\nFor the point to be singular, all derivatives must be zero. So, -6ζ^5=0 and -6=0. This is impossible in characteristic not dividing 6. Hence, no singular points at infinity. Check for singular points in the affine part (z=1). Set z=1, then F=xy -x^6 -y^6. Compute partial derivatives:\n\nF_x = y -6x^5\n\nF_y =x -6y^5\n\nF_z =4xy (not needed since z=1)\n\nA singular point requires y=6x^5 and x=6y^5. Substitute y=6x^5 into x=6y^5: x=6*(6x^5)^5=6*6^5 x^{25}=6^6 x^{25}. Thus, x -6^6 x^{25}=0 ⇒x(1 -6^6 x^{24})=0. Solutions are x=0 or x^{24}=1/6^6. If x=0, then y=6*0^5=0. Check if (0,0) is on the curve: 0*0 -0^6 -0^6=0, yes. Compute derivatives at (0,0): F_x=0, F_y=0, so (0,0) is a singular point. So the curve has at least one singular point. However, the presence of a singular point doesn't necessarily imply reducibility. For example, the cusp y^2=x^3 is irreducible but has a singular point.\n\nThus, this approach also doesn't settle the issue.\n\nWait, but if the curve has only one singular point, which is (0,0), and assuming it's a node or cusp, but how does that help? Maybe by considering the number of components. If the curve were reducible, it would have more than one component, each contributing to the singular points. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that all these methods are not working, maybe there's a trick I'm missing. Let's think differently. Suppose f = xy -x^6 -y^6 is reducible. Then, it must factor into two polynomials of lower degree. Let's try to find such a factorization.\n\nAssume f = (a x^k + b y^m + ...)(c x^l + d y^n + ...). Given the degrees, suppose f factors into a quadratic and a quartic. Let's try:\n\nLet A be quadratic and B be quartic. Then, A*B must generate terms up to degree 6. The highest degree terms in A would be x^2, xy, y^2, and in B x^4, x^3y, etc. The product's highest degree terms would be x^2*x^4 =x^6, y^2*y^4=y^6, and cross terms. But in f, the highest degree terms are -x^6 and -y^6, so to get those, the leading terms of A and B must multiply to give -x^6 and -y^6. Suppose A has a term x^2 and B has a term -x^4. Similarly, A has a term y^2 and B has a term -y^4. But then, the product would have cross terms like x^2*(-y^4) = -x^2 y^4, which aren't present in f. So this seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, suppose A is of the form x + y + ... and B is a quintic. Then, the product would have x*(-x^5) = -x^6 and y*(-y^5)= -y^6, which are the required terms. The cross term xy would come from x*y*1 (if there's a 1 in the quintic). But then, the quintic would need to have a constant term, but f has no constant term. Wait, if A is x + y and B is -x^5 - y^5 +1, then multiplying gives -x^6 -x^5 y +x -x^5 y -y^6 +y. This has terms -x^6 - y^6 -2x^5 y +x + y, which is not equal to f. So this doesn't work.\n\nAnother try: Let A be a quadratic in x and y, like x + a y, and B a quartic. Suppose A = x + a y. Then B must be a quartic such that (x +a y)B = xy -x^6 -y^6. Expanding B as a quartic: B = b x^4 + c x^3 y + d x^2 y^2 + e x y^3 + f y^4 + lower degree terms. Multiplying A and B:\n\nx*B = b x^5 +c x^4 y +d x^3 y^2 +e x^2 y^3 +f x y^4 + lower x terms.\n\na y*B =a b x^4 y +a c x^3 y^2 +a d x^2 y^3 +a e x y^4 +a f y^5 + lower y terms.\n\nThe product must equal -x^6 -y^6 +xy. So, looking at the highest degree terms:\n\nThe x^5 term comes from x*b x^4 =b x^5. There is no x^5 term in f, so b=0.\n\nSimilarly, the y^5 term is a f y^5. There's no y^5 term in f, so a f=0. Since a is part of the assumed factor, if a=0, then A=x, which we already considered. If f=0, then proceed.\n\nWith b=0 and f=0, now B is a quartic without x^4 and y^4 terms. Wait, no, B is a quartic, so it must have terms up to x^4 or y^4, but if b=0 and f=0, then B would have terms up to x^3 y^4 or something. This is getting too messy.\n\nAlternatively, consider the monomials present in f: xy, -x^6, -y^6. If f factors into A*B, then each monomial in A and B must multiply to give these terms. For example, the term xy must come from the product of a term in A and a term in B. Suppose A has a term x and B has a term y. Then, the other terms must multiply to give the remaining terms. But then, the product would have x*y from A and B, but also other terms like x*(other terms in B) and y*(other terms in A), leading to terms like x*B_rest and y*A_rest. However, in f, the only other terms are -x^6 and -y^6. This suggests that A and B must be such that their other terms multiply to give -x^6 -y^6, but without introducing any other cross terms, which seems impossible unless A and B have very specific forms.\n\nAfter trying all these methods and not finding a factorization, it's likely that the polynomial is indeed irreducible. The key idea is that the presence of the low-degree term xy alongside high-degree terms makes it resistant to factorization because any potential factors would introduce unwanted cross terms of intermediate degrees, which are not present in the original polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that f is irreducible, and the assumptions are that f is in k[x,y] and we need to show its irreducibility.",
