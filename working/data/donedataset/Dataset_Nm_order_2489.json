    "Content": "Here is the question I'm currently looking at: Show that the discriminant of the equation $y^3+py+q=0$ is $-4p^3-27q^2$ . I've done some research and found this , but we haven't studied Vieta's theorem in my math class just yet. All I know is that if we take a cubic equation of the form $$x^3+ax^2+bx+c=0$$ and we manipulate it to get rid of the $x^2$ term, then we yield $$y^3+py+q=0$$ where $$p=\\frac{3b-a^2}{3}$$ and $$q=\\frac{27c+2a^3-9ab}{27}$$ Other than that, I don't know how to approach this question.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Any $y^3 + py + q$ can be written as $F := (y-x_1)(y-x_2)(y+x_1 + x_2)$ for some $x_1,x_2$ in an algebraic extension. So it suffices to prove the formula just for this one polynomial $F$. Compute the discriminant of $F$ directly from the definition, compute the $x^1$ and $x^0$ coefficients in $F$ (i.e. $p$ and $q$) in terms of $x_1,x_2$, then compute $-4p^3-27q^2$ and compare.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to show that the discriminant of the depressed cubic equation y³ + py + q = 0 is -4p³ -27q². \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a discriminant is. The discriminant of a polynomial equation gives information about the nature of its roots. For a cubic equation, the discriminant tells us whether the roots are real or complex, and if they are all distinct. The formula for the discriminant of a general cubic equation x³ + ax² + bx + c = 0 is something I might have seen before, but since the question is about the depressed cubic (which has no x² term), maybe I need to derive it from scratch.\n\nThe user mentioned that they can transform the general cubic into the depressed cubic by substituting x = y - a/3, which removes the x² term. The coefficients p and q in the depressed cubic are given in terms of a, b, c. But the problem here is specifically about the discriminant of the depressed cubic, not the original one. So maybe the discriminant of the depressed cubic can be related to the discriminant of the original cubic, but since the user hasn't studied Vieta's formulas, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the definition of the discriminant for a cubic. For a general cubic equation y³ + py + q = 0, the discriminant D is given by D = -4p³ -27q². But how to derive this?\n\nOne method to find the discriminant is to use the formula involving the roots. Suppose the roots of the depressed cubic are r1, r2, r3. Then the discriminant D is (r1 - r2)²(r1 - r3)²(r2 - r3)². However, expanding this directly might be complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic equation of the form y³ + py + q = 0, the discriminant can also be calculated using the resultant of the cubic and its derivative, which might be another approach. The derivative is 3y² + p, so the discriminant could be related to the resultant of y³ + py + q and 3y² + p. But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way without Vieta's formulas.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the relationship between the discriminant of the original cubic and the depressed cubic. Since the depressed cubic is obtained by a linear substitution (Tschirnhaus substitution), the discriminant should be preserved up to some scaling factor. But the user provided expressions for p and q in terms of a, b, c from the original cubic. Maybe if I take the discriminant of the original cubic and substitute the expressions for p and q, I can get the discriminant of the depressed cubic.\n\nThe general formula for the discriminant of the cubic x³ + ax² + bx + c = 0 is D = 18abc - 4a³c + a²b² - 4b³ - 27c². If we substitute a = 0 (since the depressed cubic has no y² term), then p = (3b - a²)/3 = (3b)/3 = b, and q = (27c + 2a³ - 9ab)/27 = 27c/27 = c. So substituting a=0 into the original discriminant formula gives D = 18*0*b*c -4*0³*c + 0²*b² -4b³ -27c² = -4b³ -27c². But in the depressed cubic, p = b and q = c when a=0. Therefore, the discriminant would be D = -4p³ -27q², which matches the desired result. However, this seems too straightforward. Wait, but the user is asking for the discriminant of the depressed cubic equation y³ + py + q = 0, which is obtained by substituting x = y - a/3 into the original equation. So the discriminant should be related but maybe scaled?\n\nWait, actually, when we make the substitution x = y - a/3, the discriminant remains the same because it's a linear substitution that doesn't affect the discriminant's value (discriminant is invariant under linear transformations). Therefore, the discriminant of the original cubic and the depressed cubic should be the same. But in the original cubic, if we express it in terms of p and q as defined, then substituting a, b, c in terms of p and q into the original discriminant formula should give us the discriminant in terms of p and q. Let's check:\n\nOriginal cubic: x³ + ax² + bx + c = 0.\n\nAfter substitution, depressed cubic: y³ + py + q = 0, where p = (3b - a²)/3, q = (27c + 2a³ -9ab)/27.\n\nOriginal discriminant D_original = 18abc -4a³c + a²b² -4b³ -27c².\n\nWe need to express D_original in terms of p and q. Let's substitute b = (3p + a²)/3 and c = (27q - 2a³ +9ab)/27. But this might get messy. Alternatively, since after substitution the depressed cubic has discriminant D_depressed = -4p³ -27q², which should equal the original discriminant D_original. Therefore, we can conclude that the discriminant of the depressed cubic is indeed -4p³ -27q².\n\nBut the user wants to show this from scratch without using Vieta's formulas. Maybe using the definition with the roots. Let me try that.\n\nLet the roots of y³ + py + q = 0 be r, s, t. Then, by Vieta's (even though the user says they haven't studied it, maybe they know the basics), r + s + t = 0 (since the coefficient of y² is 0), rs + rt + st = p, and rst = -q.\n\nThe discriminant D is (r - s)²(r - t)²(s - t)². To compute this, we can use the formula for the discriminant of a cubic in terms of the roots:\n\nD = (r - s)^2(r - t)^2(s - t)^2 = -4(rs + rt + st)^3 - 27(rst)^2 + 18(rst)(rs + rt + st) - 4(rs + rt + st)^3 ... Wait, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I know that for the cubic y³ + py + q = 0, the discriminant can be computed as D = -4p³ - 27q². But how to derive that from the roots?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the resultant of the cubic and its derivative. The discriminant is equal to the resultant of the polynomial and its derivative divided by the leading coefficient. For a cubic f(y) = y³ + py + q, the derivative f’(y) = 3y² + p. The discriminant D is then given by the determinant of the Sylvester matrix of f and f’ divided by 1 (the leading coefficient of f). Let's construct the Sylvester matrix:\n\nFor f(y) = y³ + 0y² + py + q and f’(y) = 3y² + 0y + p, the Sylvester matrix is a 5x5 matrix. The matrix for two polynomials of degrees 3 and 2 is:\n\n[1 0 p q 0]\n\n[0 1 0 p q]\n\n[3 0 p 0 0]\n\n[0 3 0 p 0]\n\n[0 0 3 0 p]\n\nBut this might be tedious to compute. Alternatively, the discriminant can be calculated as:\n\nD = -4p³ -27q²\n\nBut I need to verify this using the resultant method. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the discriminant of a depressed cubic directly. Since the user wants to show that the discriminant is -4p³ -27q², perhaps expanding the discriminant in terms of the roots is the way to go.\n\nGiven the roots r, s, t, we have:\n\nD = (r - s)^2(r - t)^2(s - t)^2\n\nWe need to express this in terms of p and q. We know that:\n\nr + s + t = 0\n\nrs + rt + st = p\n\nrst = -q\n\nLet me try to express D in terms of these. Note that:\n\n(r - s)^2 = (r + s)^2 - 4rs\n\nBut since r + s + t = 0, we have t = - (r + s). So:\n\nSimilarly, (r - s)^2(r - t)^2(s - t)^2\n\nLet me compute (r - s)(r - t)(s - t)\n\nFirst, compute (r - s)(s - t)(t - r). Wait, the discriminant is the square of this product. But the sign might vary.\n\nAlternatively, use symmetric functions. It's known that for a cubic with roots r, s, t:\n\nD = 18rst(r + s + t) -4(r + s + t)^3rst + ... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, there's a formula for the discriminant in terms of the elementary symmetric functions.\n\nFor a monic cubic polynomial y³ + a y² + b y + c, the discriminant D is:\n\nD = a²b² - 4b³ - 4a³c -27c² + 18abc\n\nBut in our case, the depressed cubic is y³ + py + q = 0, so a = 0, b = p, c = q. Plugging into the formula:\n\nD = 0²*p² -4p³ -4*0³*q -27q² +18*0*p*q = -4p³ -27q²\n\nTherefore, the discriminant is indeed -4p³ -27q². That seems straightforward. So the key assumption here is that the cubic is in the depressed form y³ + py + q = 0, which is derived from the general cubic by removing the y² term. Therefore, the discriminant formula simplifies to -4p³ -27q² when the quadratic term is absent.\n\nSo the problem is to show that for the depressed cubic equation y³ + py + q = 0, the discriminant is -4p³ -27q². The assumptions would include that it's a cubic equation in the depressed form (no y² term), and that p and q are coefficients derived from the original cubic through substitution.",
