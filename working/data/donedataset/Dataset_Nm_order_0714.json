    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking how to prove two \"curious identities\". The first identity is the product of sines from k=1 to n-1 of (kπ/n) equals n divided by 2^(n-1). The second identity is the product of cosines from k=1 to n-1 of (kπ/n) equals sin(πn/2) divided by 2^(n-1).\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So for these product identities, what are the assumptions?\n\nLooking at the problem, the product is from k=1 to n-1. So n has to be an integer greater than 1 because if n=1, the upper limit would be 0, which doesn't make sense for the product. So the first assumption is that n is an integer, n ≥ 2. Wait, but maybe the problem allows n=1? Let me check the product when n=1. The product would be from k=1 to 0, which is an empty product. The right-hand side for the first identity would be 1/(2^0) = 1, but the left-hand side is 1 (empty product is 1). However, the original problem states n-1 in the product, so maybe n must be at least 2? Or does the problem implicitly assume n is a positive integer? Let me think.\n\nIn trigonometric products like these, n is typically a positive integer greater than 1. For example, the roots of unity are involved when dealing with such products. So, the assumptions would be that n is an integer, n ≥ 2. But the problem might just state \"for all positive integers n\" or something. However, the user didn't specify any restrictions, so maybe the original problem assumes n is a positive integer. Wait, but the second identity's right-hand side has sin(πn/2). If n is an integer, then sin(πn/2) is 0 when n is even, and ±1 when n is odd. So for even n, the product of cosines would be zero? Let me check n=2. For n=2, the product is from k=1 to 1 of cos(π/2) = cos(π/2) = 0, and the right-hand side is sin(π*2/2)/2^(1) = sin(π)/2 = 0/2 = 0. So that works. For n=3, product of cos(π/3) and cos(2π/3). Cos(π/3)=0.5, cos(2π/3)=-0.5. Product is -0.25. The right-hand side is sin(3π/2)/2^2 = (-1)/4 = -0.25. So that works. So the identity holds for n≥2. But when n=1, the product is empty (1), and the right-hand side would be sin(π*1/2)/2^0 = 1/1 =1. So that also works. Wait, n=1: the product from k=1 to 0, which is 1, and the right-hand side is sin(π/2)/1 =1. So actually, n can be 1 as well. But in the first identity, for n=1, the left-hand side is 1, and the right-hand side is 1/(2^0)=1. So both identities hold for n=1. So maybe the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. But perhaps in the context of the problem, the user is considering n≥2, but since the product is from k=1 to n-1, when n=1, the product is empty, but mathematically, it's valid. So maybe the assumption is just that n is a positive integer. Let me check the original problem again. The original question on Math Stack Exchange just states the identities without any qualification, so the problem is likely intended for all positive integers n. So the assumption is that n is a positive integer. That's probably the only assumption needed here. The example given in the problem had two assumptions, but maybe here there's only one.\n\nWait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, which factors into 7*13. But in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that was part of the original problem? Or was that added? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the assistant corrected it? No, the example shows that the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be an error. Let me check again.\n\nThe example's original problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So here, the assistant added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to follow the instructions and list assumptions. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user hasn't specified any restrictions on n. So the question is to prove those two product identities. The products are over k=1 to n-1. So for the product to be non-empty, n must be at least 2. Wait, but when n=1, the product is from 1 to 0, which is empty, and the product is 1. But the first identity's RHS when n=1 is 1/(2^0)=1, which matches. Similarly, for the second identity, when n=1, sin(π*1/2)/2^0 =1/1=1, which matches the empty product. So n can be 1. So the assumption is that n is a positive integer. However, maybe the problem is intended for n ≥2. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so we can only go by what's written. Therefore, the assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nBut since the example added an assumption even when the original problem said \"for every integer\", maybe the assistant is supposed to extract all implicit assumptions. But in this case, the problem as stated doesn't mention any restrictions, but mathematically, the identities hold for positive integers n. So the assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more assumptions. Let's think. The product of sines... For the sine product, when n=1, the product is 1, and the RHS is 1/2^0=1. So that's okay. For n=2, product from k=1 to 1 of sin(π/2) = 1, RHS is 2/2^(1)=1. Correct. For n=3, product of sin(π/3) and sin(2π/3). Both are sqrt(3)/2, so product is 3/4, and RHS is 3/(2^2)=3/4. Correct. Similarly, n=4: product of sin(π/4), sin(2π/4)=sin(π/2)=1, sin(3π/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So product is (sqrt(2)/2)*1*(sqrt(2)/2) = (2/4)*1=1/2. RHS is 4/2^3=4/8=1/2. Correct. So the identity holds for all positive integers n. Similarly, the cosine identity: for n=1, product is 1, RHS is sin(π*1/2)/2^0=1/1=1. For n=2, product is cos(π/2)=0, RHS sin(π*2/2)/2^(1)=sin(π)/2=0. For n=3, product cos(π/3)*cos(2π/3)=0.5*(-0.5)=-0.25, RHS sin(3π/2)/4= (-1)/4= -0.25. Correct. For n=4, product cos(π/4)*cos(2π/4)*cos(3π/4)= (sqrt(2)/2)*0*(-sqrt(2)/2)=0, RHS sin(4π/2)/8= sin(2π)/8=0. Correct. So the identities hold for all positive integers n. Hence, the only assumption needed is that n is a positive integer.\n\nBut wait, the example had two assumptions. Maybe in the original problem, there was an implicit condition, but here, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. So the formatted problem should list that. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n}\\right) = \\frac{n}{2^{n-1}}$$\nand\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\cos\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi n/2)}{2^{n-1}}$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, each assumption was on a separate line. But here, there's only one assumption. So that's okay. The problem has two separate identities, but the user wants both to be in the problem statement. The original example had one problem statement, so here, the problem is to prove both identities. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n}\\right) = \\frac{n}{2^{n-1}}$$\nand\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\cos\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi n/2)}{2^{n-1}}$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was split into two separate assumptions. But here, there's only one assumption. So the user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate lines. But here, since the only assumption is that n is a positive integer, that's a single line. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that single assumption.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there's any other implicit assumption. For example, in the cosine product, when n is even, some terms might be zero, but the identity still holds. For instance, when n is even, say n=2m, then k=m would give cos(mπ/(2m))=cos(π/2)=0, so the product is zero. The RHS is sin(π*2m/2)/2^{2m-1}=sin(mπ)/2^{2m-1}=0. So it matches. So no additional assumptions needed. Therefore, the formatted problem is as above.",
