    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is clear that $|\\langle Tx,x\\rangle|\\leq \\|T\\|$ for $\\|x\\|=1$. For the converse, it suffices to show that $|\\langle Tx,y\\rangle|\\leq \\alpha$ for all $\\|x\\|=\\|y\\|=1$, with $\\alpha=\\sup\\bigl\\{|\\langle Tx,x\\rangle|: \\|x\\|=1\\bigr\\}$. We can clearly assume $\\langle Tx,y\\rangle \\in\\mathbb R$. Then\n$$\n\\langle Tx,y\\rangle = (\\langle T(x+y),x+y\\rangle - \\langle T(x-y),x-y\\rangle)/4.\n$$\nBut then\n$$\n|\\langle Tx,y\\rangle|\\leq\\alpha(\\|x+y\\|^2+\\|x-y\\|^2)/4=\\alpha,\n$$\nby the parallelogram identity.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let's start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking to prove that the norm of a self-adjoint bounded operator A on a Hilbert space is equal to the supremum of |⟨x, Ax⟩| where the supremum is taken over all vectors x with norm 1. They want a hint on how to prove it.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions that A is a self-adjoint operator and that it's bounded. Also, it's defined on a Hilbert space. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property per object.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- A is a self-adjoint operator.\n- A is a bounded operator.\n- A acts on a Hilbert space.\n- The norm of x is 1 (since the supremum is over ||x||=1).\n\nWait, but the norm of x being 1 is part of the problem statement, not an assumption about the operator. The problem is to show that the operator norm (which is usually defined as sup ||Ax|| over ||x||=1) is equal to this other supremum involving the inner product. So the assumptions are about the operator: self-adjoint, bounded, and on a Hilbert space. The condition ||x||=1 is part of the problem's statement, not an assumption on the operator's properties.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should only include the properties of A: self-adjoint, bounded, and acting on a Hilbert space. Each of these is a separate property of A. The problem then states to prove the equality of the operator norm with that specific supremum.\n\nSo, in the Assumption section, each line should be:\n- A is a self-adjoint operator.\n- A is a bounded operator.\n- A acts on a Hilbert space.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that ||A|| equals that supremum.\n\nLet me check the example given. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the formatted problem only listed n is an integer and then the problem includes the divisibility by 7 as part of the problem statement. Wait, no. Wait, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption lists n is an integer, and the problem says \"prove ... divisible by 91\". But in the original problem, there was no mention that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Wait, the example shows that the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem included it? Wait, no. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's Assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, there was no restriction that n is divisible by 7. So the example seems to have added an assumption? Or maybe there was a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user in the example made an error. Alternatively, maybe the example is showing that sometimes you need to filter out unrelated information. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the user had some extra conditions but the formatted problem corrects it. Hmm, this is confusing. But according to the instructions, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem properly.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to prove that for a self-adjoint bounded operator A on a Hilbert space, the norm ||A|| is equal to sup_{||x||=1} |⟨x, Ax⟩|. The standard definition of the operator norm is sup_{||x||=1} ||Ax||. But for self-adjoint operators, this is equal to the supremum of |⟨x, Ax⟩|. So the assumptions here are that A is self-adjoint, bounded, and on a Hilbert space. The problem is to show the equality of the operator norm with that supremum.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list each property of A. Each on a separate line. The problem is the statement to prove.",
