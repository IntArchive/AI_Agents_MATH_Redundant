    "Content": "I'm familiarizing myself with manifolds. I tried to show $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ is a manifold with a boundary. Can you please tell me if my proof is correct: The definition for manifold with boundary: A manifold with boundary $M$ is a second countable Hausdorff space so that for a $p \\in M$ there is an open set $U \\subseteq M$ so that there is a homeomorphism $\\varphi$ to either (a) an open set $V$ in $H^n \\setminus \\partial H^n$  or to (b) an open set $V$ in $H^n$ and $\\varphi (p) \\in \\partial H^n$ where $H^n$ is the closed upper half plane. It means $H^n = \\{x \\in \\mathbb R^n : x_k \\ge 0 ; 1 \\le k \\le n \\}$. One has to show $M = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$ is second countable, Hausdorff and locally homeomorphic to $H^n$. $M$ is second countable because it has subspace topology of $H^2$. It is Hausdorff because it has subspace topology of $H^2$. Locally Euclidean: For point $p \\in M$ take set $U$ open in $H^2$ with $p \\in U$. Inclusion map $i: U \\to U \\subseteq H^2$ is local homeomorphism with the property maps to open set and if $p \\in \\partial M$ then $i(p) \\in \\partial H^2$. I am very grateful for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The portion where you show that $M$ is locally Euclidean is not correct and here's why: You have to show that for every point $p \\in M$ there exists a neighborhood $U \\subseteq M$ of $p$ and a homeomorphism from $U$ to an open subset of either $\\mathbb R^2$ or $\\mathbb H^2$. Now here's what you wrote: For point $p \\in M$ take set $U$ open in $\\mathbb H^2$ with $p \\in U$ So your neighborhood $U$ is in $\\mathbb H^2$ and not in $M$!  While it is indeed true that $M \\subseteq \\mathbb H^2$ we cannot simply say that a neighborhood in $\\mathbb H^2$ is a neighborhood in $M$.  If $p$ is the point $p = (1, 1)$ then any neighborhood of $p$ in $\\mathbb H^2$ will contain points that are not in $M$. Edit: To fix the proof remember that if $U \\subseteq M$ contains part of the boundry of $M$ then the chart for $U$ will have to map that boundry to the boundry of $\\mathbb H^2$.  So for example if $p = (1, 1)$ then let $U = (.4, 1] \\times (.4, 1]$ and for a chart try $\\phi\\colon U \\to \\mathbb H^2$ defined by $\\phi(x, y) = (1 - x, 1 - y)$.  I leave it to you to check that the image of $\\phi$ is open in $\\mathbb H^2$ and that $\\phi$ is a homeomorphism onto this image.  You'll also need to come up with charts covering the rest of $M$.  I suggest you take $U_2 = [0, .6) \\times (.4, 1]$ $U_3 = (.4, 1] \\times [0, .6)$ $U_4 = [0, .6) \\times [0, .6)$ as the neighborhoods for those charts. Edit #2: Whoops!  My edit above has a mistake as pointed out by goobie.  Also pointed out by goobie is the fix: Instead of the chart $\\phi$ that I suggested take $\\phi\\colon U \\to \\mathbb H^2$ defined by $\\phi(z) = z^2$ (here I'm using complex numbers to denote points in the plane).  Then you'll just need to do some translation and rotation to handle the other corners.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the Assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and the Problem should be the main statement to prove.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is \"Showing [0,1] × [0,1] is a manifold with boundary.\" The user is trying to prove that the square [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary using the definition provided. They mention the definition of a manifold with boundary, which requires the space to be second countable, Hausdorff, and locally homeomorphic to H^n. The user argues each point: second countable because subspace topology of H², Hausdorff similarly, and locally Euclidean by taking open sets in H² and using inclusion maps.\n\nThe user is asking if their proof is correct. But the task here is to structure the problem, not the answer. So the problem is to show that [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the definition that the problem is using. Let's look at the definition provided in the question: A manifold with boundary M is a second countable Hausdorff space such that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open set in H^n (either not intersecting the boundary or intersecting it, with the point mapped to the boundary in the latter case). \n\nSo, the problem is to show that M = [0,1]×[0,1] satisfies these three properties. The user's attempt already mentions each of these properties. So the assumptions would be each condition M must satisfy according to the definition. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Let's break down the definition into individual assumptions:\n\n1. M is a second countable space.\n2. M is a Hausdorff space.\n3. For every point p in M, there exists an open set U containing p such that U is homeomorphic to an open set in H² (either case (a) or (b) as per the definition).\n4. If p is in the boundary of M, then the homeomorphism maps p to the boundary of H².\n\nBut wait, the definition combines these into the three main properties: second countable, Hausdorff, and locally homeomorphic to H^n (with the boundary condition). So the problem is to show that M meets these three main conditions. The original problem statement in the user's question is to show that [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary. Therefore, the assumptions would be the properties that need to be verified. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were the conditions given in the problem (like n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). Here, the problem is to verify that M satisfies the definition's conditions, which are the three main properties. But perhaps the problem is structured as \"Prove that [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary under the following conditions,\" but the definition itself is the assumption.\n\nWait, maybe the assumptions here are the components of the definition that need to be checked for M. But according to the example, the assumptions were the conditions given in the problem (like n is an integer). In this case, the problem is to prove that M is a manifold with boundary. The definition is the framework, so the problem's assumptions would be the properties that M must have. But in the example, the user's original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, it's listed as assumptions. Here, the problem is to show that M is a manifold with boundary, so the assumptions are the conditions that need to be verified. However, maybe in this case, the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the structure of M. Wait, the example had the problem's assumptions as the conditions given (n is integer, n divisible by 7). But in this case, the original problem is to prove that M is a manifold with boundary, so the assumptions would be the parts of the definition that the user is using. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties of M that are given implicitly. Wait, the problem is to prove that M is a manifold with boundary. The definition requires three things: second countable, Hausdorff, locally homeomorphic to H^n. So to structure the problem, perhaps the assumptions are the components that M has, but in the example, the assumptions were the given conditions for n. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem stated that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user then formatted the assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that's not exactly matching. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example had a typo. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Maybe the example is wrong, but perhaps it's a different scenario. Maybe the original problem in the example had a mistake, but the user's instruction was to filter unrelated information. Hmm. But perhaps the example is trying to extract the essential assumptions. Maybe in that problem, the divisibility by 91 comes from 7 and 13, and if n is divisible by 7, then 91 divides A(n), but the original problem was for all integers n. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, following the user's instruction, for the current problem, we need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the given format.\n\nThe original problem is to show that [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary. The user's attempt mentions the definition, which requires the space to be second countable, Hausdorff, and locally homeomorphic to H² (with conditions on the boundary points). Therefore, the problem is to verify those three properties for M = [0,1]×[0,1].\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were the conditions on n. Here, the problem's assumptions would be the properties that M must satisfy according to the definition. But since the problem is to prove that M is a manifold with boundary, the assumptions would be the given conditions that M is the square [0,1]×[0,1] with the subspace topology from H². But perhaps the user is assuming that the reader knows the definition, so the problem is to verify each condition. However, the user's original question includes the definition, so maybe the assumptions should be the components of the definition. Wait, the problem is to show that M satisfies the definition. Therefore, the assumptions are the parts of the definition. Wait, but the example's assumption was about the variable in the problem. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that are given but not to be proven. For example, in the problem of proving divisibility by 91, the assumption is that n is an integer, and perhaps another condition. In the current problem, the assumptions might be that M is equipped with the subspace topology from H², and perhaps other inherent properties. Wait, but the problem statement is to show M is a manifold with boundary. The user's own proof attempt mentions that M is second countable and Hausdorff because it's a subspace of H². But maybe the problem assumes that H² is second countable and Hausdorff, and thus subspaces inherit those properties. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem could be:\n\n- M is a subspace of H².\n- H² is second countable.\n- H² is Hausdorff.\n\nBut the problem is to show that M is a manifold with boundary, which would require showing the three properties: second countable, Hausdorff, and locally homeomorphic to H². However, since M is a subspace of H², the first two properties (second countable and Hausdorff) are inherited if H² is second countable and Hausdorff, which it is. Therefore, the problem's assumptions might include that H² is second countable and Hausdorff, and that M has the subspace topology. But perhaps in the problem statement, the user is taking that for granted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions that need to be verified but are stated as givens. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. So maybe the example is incorrect, and the user wants to extract the key assumptions from the problem. In this case, the key problem is to show that [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary. The definition requires three things: second countable, Hausdorff, locally homeomorphic to H². So the problem is to verify those three for M. Therefore, the assumptions would be that M is the product space [0,1]×[0,1], with the subspace topology inherited from H². But perhaps each assumption is a separate condition:\n\n- M is the product of two intervals [0,1].\n- M is equipped with the subspace topology from H².\n- A manifold with boundary must be second countable, Hausdorff, and locally homeomorphic to H².\n\nBut maybe the problem's assumptions are the components that M has to satisfy. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The user's example added assumptions that were not explicitly stated in the original problem. For instance, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which actually restricts the problem. That seems incorrect, but perhaps it's part of filtering unrelated information. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem where the user made a mistake. Anyway, focusing back on the current problem.\n\nThe problem is to show that [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary. The definition requires three conditions: second countable, Hausdorff, locally homeomorphic to H². The user's attempt argues each point. So to structure the problem, the assumptions would be the three conditions that need to be verified. However, in the example, the assumptions were the conditions applied to the variable. Here, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that the space M must satisfy. So:\n\nAssumption: \nM is a second countable space,\nM is a Hausdorff space,\nFor every point p in M, there exists an open neighborhood U in M homeomorphic to an open subset of H²,\nIf p is in the boundary of M, then the homeomorphism maps p to the boundary of H².\n\nBut these are actually the conditions to be proven, not the assumptions. Wait, but the problem is to prove that M is a manifold with boundary, which means proving those conditions. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are the given properties of M. For example, M is the subspace [0,1]×[0,1] in H², which inherits the subspace topology. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nM is the subspace [0,1]×[0,1] of H²,\nThe subspace topology on M is second countable,\nThe subspace topology on M is Hausdorff,\nFor each point p in M, there exists an open set U in M containing p such that U is homeomorphic to an open set in H².\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to show these properties, so they are not assumptions but the things to prove. Therefore, the assumptions might be the components given in the problem statement. The original problem says, \"show that [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary,\" so the assumptions are the properties inherent in the definition. But perhaps the problem is structured as follows:\n\nAssumption: M is the product space [0,1]×[0,1],\nM is equipped with the subspace topology from H²,\nA manifold with boundary is a second countable Hausdorff space locally homeomorphic to H².\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut I think the key here is to extract the necessary conditions from the problem statement and present them as assumptions. The user's original question includes the definition of a manifold with boundary, so the problem is to verify that M satisfies the three conditions. Therefore, the assumptions are the components of the definition applied to M. However, in the example, the assumptions were the conditions on the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Translating that here, the assumptions would be the conditions that M must meet according to the definition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a second countable space,\nM is a Hausdorff space,\nFor every point p in M, there exists an open neighborhood U of p in M that is homeomorphic to an open subset of H².\n\nBut in the definition provided in the question, there's a part about the boundary points: if p is in the boundary, then the homeomorphism maps p to the boundary of H². So maybe that's another assumption. However, this is part of the local homeomorphism condition. So perhaps the problem's assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a second countable space,\nM is a Hausdorff space,\nFor every point p in M, there exists an open neighborhood U of p in M that is homeomorphic to an open subset of H² by a homeomorphism φ, and if p is in the boundary of M, then φ(p) is in the boundary of H².\n\nBut this is part of the same local homeomorphism condition. Therefore, the problem is to show that M satisfies these three (or four) conditions. Therefore, structuring the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a second countable space,\nM is a Hausdorff space,\nM is locally homeomorphic to H² with boundary points mapped to the boundary of H².\n\nProblem: Show that [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that M is a manifold with boundary, which by definition requires those three properties. So perhaps the assumptions are the components of the definition. However, the example shows that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the original example, the problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to filter out unnecessary parts. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the formatted version corrects it. Anyway, focusing on the current problem.\n\nThe user's question is to structure the problem as per the format. The original question on Math SE is the user's attempt to show that [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary by verifying the three conditions. The problem, therefore, is to prove that M = [0,1]×[0,1] is a manifold with boundary, which requires verifying the three properties. The assumptions would be the properties that M must satisfy according to the definition. However, since the problem is to prove those properties, maybe the assumptions are the given conditions of M. For example, M is a subspace of H², which is second countable and Hausdorff. Therefore, the assumptions could be:\n\nAssumption:\nM has the subspace topology inherited from H²,\nH² is second countable,\nH² is Hausdorff,\nLocal homeomorphism conditions need to be verified for M.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is to list the components that need to be proven as the problem, and the assumptions are the given conditions. However, in this case, the problem is to prove that M is a manifold with boundary, which by definition requires three conditions. Therefore, the problem is to show that M satisfies these conditions, and the assumptions are the given properties of M. But the user's original problem statement doesn't provide any extra assumptions beyond the definition. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the parts of the definition, but that might not fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the properties that are already given and don't need proof. For example, in the user's proof attempt, they state that M is second countable and Hausdorff because it's a subspace of H². So the assumption here is that H² is second countable and Hausdorff, and subspaces inherit these properties. Therefore, the assumptions could be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a subspace of H²,\nSubspaces of second countable spaces are second countable,\nSubspaces of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff,\nIt remains to verify the locally Euclidean condition.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that M is a manifold with boundary, which includes all three conditions. However, the user's proof argues that the first two are inherited, and the third is by local homeomorphism. Therefore, the assumptions might be the inherited properties, but the problem is to verify the local homeomorphism. But I think this is complicating.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to follow the example. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems to add an extra condition (divisible by 7), which might not be in the original problem. It's possible that there was a mistake in the example. However, following the user's instruction to \"filter the unrelated information,\" in the current problem, the original question includes the user's attempt, but the task is to extract the problem in the given format.\n\nLooking back, the user's problem is: \"Showing [0,1] × [0,1] is a manifold with boundary.\" The definition requires three properties. The user's proof attempt mentions each of these. So the formatted problem should have the problem as \"Prove that [0,1] × [0,1] is a manifold with boundary,\" and the assumptions are the conditions from the definition that need to be checked. But in the example, the assumptions were conditions on the variable. Here, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that the space must satisfy, but since the problem is to prove those properties, maybe there are no assumptions beyond the definition. Alternatively, the assumptions are the parts of the definition that the user is using.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the components of the definition, but in the problem statement. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nA manifold with boundary is a second countable Hausdorff space locally homeomorphic to H^n,\nM = [0,1] × [0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut this seems too vague. The example had specific conditions on n. Maybe in this case, since the problem is to verify the three properties, each of those properties becomes an assumption, but that's not correct because they are what needs to be proven.\n\nI think there's confusion here. The example might have been incorrectly formatted, but following the user's instruction, we need to list the assumptions of the problem. In the original problem, the assumptions are that M is [0,1]×[0,1], and the problem is to prove it's a manifold with boundary. The definition requires three conditions, which are the things to prove, not assumptions. Therefore, perhaps in this case, there are no explicit assumptions beyond M being the square. However, the example had assumptions listed, even though they were part of the problem's conditions. Maybe the correct approach is to list the components that are given in the problem. For example, the problem is to show that M is a manifold with boundary, so the assumption is that M is the space [0,1]×[0,1], and the problem is to prove it's a manifold with boundary. But the example included mathematical conditions on n. So perhaps in this case:\n\nAssumption:\nM is the product space [0,1] × [0,1],\nM is equipped with the subspace topology from H².\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut the user's original question already states that M is [0,1]×[0,1], so the assumption is the space itself. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is the space [0,1] × [0,1],\nM is equipped with the subspace topology from H².\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are the conditions on the variables. Here, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that the problem takes for granted. For example, the subspace topology is second countable and Hausdorff because H² is. Therefore, the assumptions could be:\n\nAssumption:\nH² is a second countable space,\nH² is a Hausdorff space,\nOpen subsets of H² are homeomorphic to H².\n\nProblem: Prove that M = [0,1] × [0,1] is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut I think this is overcomplicating. The key is to follow the example structure. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But that actually changes the problem's scope. It seems like the example might have a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to extract the essential assumptions from the problem. In the current case, the essential assumption is that M is [0,1]×[0,1], and the problem is to prove it's a manifold with boundary. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is the space [0,1] × [0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut this seems too minimal. However, according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" the formatted problem adds that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions include the properties that need to be verified. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is to show the conclusion. In the example, the original problem's conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions are that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem is to show divisibility by 91. But 91 is 7×13, so if n is divisible by 7, then perhaps A(n) is divisible by 7² or something. But this seems off. Anyway, maybe the example is not the best, but the user wants us to follow it.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to show M is a manifold with boundary. The user's attempt mentions using the subspace topology from H². So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nM has the subspace topology inherited from H²,\nM is second countable,\nM is Hausdorff,\nFor each point p in M, there exists an open neighborhood U in M homeomorphic to an open set in H².\n\nBut again, these are the conditions to prove. I think the confusion comes from the example possibly being incorrect. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to list the components of the definition as assumptions and the problem as proving M satisfies them. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nA manifold with boundary is a second countable Hausdorff space locally homeomorphic to H²,\nM is the space [0,1] × [0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Alternatively, the assumptions are the parts of the definition that need to be verified. So:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a second countable space,\nM is a Hausdorff space,\nFor every point p in M, there exists an open neighborhood U in M homeomorphic to an open subset of H²,\nIf p is in the boundary of M, then the homeomorphism maps p to the boundary of H².\n\nProblem: Show that M = [0,1] × [0,1] satisfies the above assumptions.\n\nBut this is mixing the problem and assumptions. The problem is to show that M is a manifold with boundary, which by definition requires those assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is the space [0,1] × [0,1],\nA manifold with boundary requires being second countable, Hausdorff, and locally homeomorphic to H².\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut I think the correct answer, following the example's approach (even if the example is flawed), is to list the conditions that M must satisfy as assumptions. Since the example listed the conditions on n as assumptions (even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\"), here we might list the components of the definition as assumptions. However, the example added an extra condition (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, so perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. But in this case, there are no implicit assumptions; the problem is to verify the three properties.\n\nGiven the confusion, but trying to adhere to the example's structure, perhaps the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a second countable space,\nM is a Hausdorff space,\nFor every point p in M, there exists an open neighborhood U in M that is homeomorphic to an open subset of H²,\nIf p is in the boundary of M, then the homeomorphism maps p to the boundary of H².\n\nProblem: Show that [0,1] × [0,1] satisfies the above assumptions.\n\nBut this seems to make the problem redundant, as the assumptions are what need to be proven. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the components that are already given. For example, M is a subspace of H², which is second countable and Hausdorff, so the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a subspace of H²,\nH² is second countable,\nH² is Hausdorff.\n\nProblem: Prove that M = [0,1] × [0,1] is a manifold with boundary.\n\nThis way, the assumptions are the given facts, and the problem is to show that M is a manifold with boundary, which requires checking the local homeomorphism part. The user's proof attempt mentions that second countability and Hausdorff are inherited from H², so those are covered by the assumptions, and the problem is to verify the local homeomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the properties that need to be proven, but that doesn't fit the example. The example's assumptions were the conditions on n, which were part of the problem's statement. Here, the problem's statement is to show M is a manifold with boundary. Therefore, the assumptions would be the properties that M must satisfy according to the definition. But since the problem is to prove those properties, they are not assumptions but conclusions.\n\nThis is quite confusing. Given the time I've spent, I think the best approach is to follow the user's example structure, even if it seems flawed. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. So perhaps in the current problem, even though the original problem is to prove M is a manifold with boundary, the assumptions are the components of the definition that M must satisfy. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a second countable space,\nM is a Hausdorff space,\nM is locally homeomorphic to H².\n\nProblem: Prove that [0,1] × [0,1] is a manifold with boundary.\n\nBut this lists the conditions as assumptions, which are actually what needs to be proven. However, given the example's approach, perhaps this is acceptable. Alternatively, the assumptions are the components of the definition provided in the problem statement. The original question includes the definition, so perhaps the assumptions are the definition's parts:\n\nAssumption:\nA manifold with boundary is a second countable Hausdorff space locally homeomorphic to H^n,\nM = [0,1] × [0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a manifold with boundary.\n\nThis seems more accurate, as the problem is to apply the definition to M. Therefore, the assumption is the definition, and M is given. The problem is to prove M meets the definition. But the example had assumptions about the variable, not the definition. Given the confusion, I think the correct answer is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$M$ is the space $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$,\n$M$ has the subspace topology inherited from $H^2$,\nA manifold with boundary is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to $H^2$.\nProblem: \nShow that $M$ is a manifold with boundary.",
