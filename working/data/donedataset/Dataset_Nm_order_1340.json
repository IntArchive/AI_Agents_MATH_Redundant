    "Content": "I need to prove the following bound $$n! \\le e \\sqrt n \\left( \\frac n e \\right)^n$$ I can bound $\\ln 1 + \\ln 2 + \\dots + \\ln n$ as a Riemann sum with the function $\\ln(n+1)$ and the trapezoidal rule: $$(\\ln 1)/2 + \\sum_{i=2}^n \\ln i \\ + (\\ln(n+1))/2 < \\int_0^n \\ln (x+1) dx $$ Integrating I get the bound $$n! < \\left( \\frac{n+1}{e} \\right)^n \\sqrt{n+1}$$ As $n$ goes to infinity, my bound and the required bound get arbitrarily close (for $n=1$, the error is about $4\\%$), but the one I need to prove is slightly tighter. How can I modify my bound to get the required bound?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "So you have\n$n! \n\\lt \\left( \\frac{n+1}{e} \\right)^n \\sqrt{n+1}\n$. I'll play and see what happens. Replacing $n$ by $n-1$,\nwe get\n$(n-1)! \n\\lt \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^{n-1} \\sqrt{n}\n$. Multiplying by $n$,\nwe get $\\begin{array}\\\\\nn! \n&\\lt n\\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^{n-1} \\sqrt{n}\\\\\n&= e\\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^{n} \\sqrt{n}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n$ which is what you want!!!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let's look at the example they provided. The original problem was about proving a divisibility condition, and in the formatted version, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then the problem statement followed.\n\nNow, looking at the new problem from the user. The title is \"Almost Stirling's Approximation,\" and the question is about proving a specific bound for n factorial. The user also provided their attempt using the trapezoidal rule and an integral, getting a bound close but not exactly what's needed. They need to adjust their approach to get the tighter bound.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem statement is to prove that n! ≤ e√n (n/e)^n. The original attempt used a Riemann sum and trapezoidal rule with the function ln(n+1) and integrated from 0 to n. The result gave a bound of ((n+1)/e)^n * sqrt(n+1), which is close but not the desired one.\n\nWait, but the problem itself doesn't mention any specific conditions on n. The example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about factorial, so n must be a positive integer. Also, in the original attempt, they considered n going to infinity, but the problem itself might just be for all positive integers n. The user's question is how to modify their bound to get the required one, which is slightly tighter.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove the inequality. But wait, the example included an assumption about divisibility by 7, but here there's no such condition except n being a positive integer. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Prove the following bound $$n! \\le e \\sqrt n \\left( \\frac n e \\right)^n$$... As n goes to infinity, my bound and the required bound get arbitrarily close... How can I modify my bound to get the required bound?\"\n\nSo the problem is for all positive integers n. The user's approach led to an upper bound of ((n+1)/e)^n * sqrt(n+1), which is slightly larger than the desired e√n (n/e)^n. The user wants to adjust their method to get the tighter bound.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, the assumptions should list each condition. Since factorial is defined for non-negative integers, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. There might be another assumption implicit here, but the problem as stated doesn't mention any other constraints. So maybe the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. Let me verify with the example.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made a typo there. Because if the original problem was for every integer n, then the divisibility by 7 would not be an assumption but part of the problem. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a specific condition. Hmm, maybe the example was from a different problem. But regardless, in the current problem, the user is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question.\n\nSo, the current problem's assumptions would be that n is a positive integer. There's no other condition stated. The problem is to prove the inequality. So in the Assumption section, it should list \"n is a positive integer.\" Each assumption line addresses one property of one object. So that's it.\n\nBut the original problem's user attempt used integrals and trapezoidal rule, which might require n to be large, but the problem statement is for all positive integers n. So the correct assumption is n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove the bound.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the current problem is different. Let's focus on the given problem.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$n! \\le e \\sqrt{n} \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n.$$\n\nThat's it. The user's attempt led to a similar bound but with (n+1) terms instead of n, and they need to adjust their approach. But the problem itself doesn't have additional assumptions beyond n being a positive integer. So I think that's the correct structure here.",
