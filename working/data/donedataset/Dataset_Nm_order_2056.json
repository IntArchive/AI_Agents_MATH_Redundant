    "Content": "Let $A\\subseteq B\\subseteq C$ be commutative unital rings. Recall that the extension $A \\subseteq B$ is finite / of finite type / integral , when $B$ is a finitely generated $R$-module / when $B$ is a finitely generated $A$-algebra / when $\\forall b \\in B$ $\\exists$ monic polynomial $f \\in A[x]$ with $f(b)=0$. Notation $_AB$ means \"$A$-module $B$\". We know that $A\\subseteq C$ is integral iff $A\\subseteq B$ and $B\\subseteq C$ are integral (Grillet, Abstract Algebra , 7.3.3). Do we also have the following: $A\\subseteq C$ is finite $\\Leftrightarrow$ $A\\subseteq B$ and $B\\subseteq C$ are finite. $A\\subseteq C$ is of finite type $\\Leftrightarrow$ $A\\subseteq B$ and $B\\subseteq C$ are of finite type. I'm having problems with ($A\\subseteq C$ finite $\\Rightarrow$ $A\\subseteq B$ finite) and with ($A\\subseteq C$ of finite type $\\Rightarrow$ $A\\subseteq B$ of finite type). If $_AB$ is a direct summand of $_AC$ (for example when $A$ is a field), i.e. $_AC= _A B\\oplus _A B'$ for some submodule $B'$ of $C$, then $C=Ac_1+\\cdots+Ac_n$ implies $c_i=b_i+b'_i$ for some $b_i\\in B$ and $b'_i \\in B$, hence $B = Ab_1 + \\cdots + Ab_n$. But what if $_AB$ is not a direct summand of $_AC$? And what about the 'finite type' case?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Neither of the implications that you are having trouble with hold in general. As an example, consider $A=k[X_1,X_2,\\ldots]$, $C=A[Y]/(Y^2)$ and $B\\subseteq C$ be the (unital) algebra over $A$ generated by terms of the form $X_iY$. You should be able to show that $C$ is finitely generated both as a module and as an algebra over $A$, but $B$ is not finitely generated over $A$ in either sense.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about ring extensions and whether certain properties (finite, finite type) of the composite extension imply the same for the intermediate extensions.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem. The user provided an example where they listed each assumption line by line, focusing on one property or condition per line applied to a single object. So, I need to extract all the assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: Let A ⊆ B ⊆ C be commutative unital rings. The question is whether A ⊆ C being finite (or of finite type) implies that both A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite (or of finite type). The user is having trouble with the implications where A ⊆ C is finite implying A ⊆ B is finite, and similarly for finite type. They mention a scenario where B is a direct summand of C as an A-module, which simplifies things, but ask about the cases when it's not.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. A, B, C are commutative unital rings.\n2. A is a subring of B.\n3. B is a subring of C.\n4. The extension A ⊆ C is finite (or of finite type).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking whether A ⊆ C being finite implies A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite. So the main assumption for the problem part is that A ⊆ C is finite (or finite type). However, the user also mentions the general setup of A ⊆ B ⊆ C. So perhaps the assumptions are the general setup and then the specific condition to be considered.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the example, the problem statement was to prove divisibility by 91. So in the example, the assumptions list includes the conditions given, and the problem is the actual question under those assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the setup is A ⊆ B ⊆ C are commutative unital rings. The problem is asking about the equivalence of A ⊆ C being finite (or finite type) with both A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C being finite (or finite type). However, the user is specifically struggling with the forward direction (A ⊆ C implies A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C). So, the problem part would be to prove that if A ⊆ C is finite, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite, and similarly for finite type.\n\nBut to structure this into the Assumption and Problem parts as per the format:\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings.\n- A is a subring of B.\n- B is a subring of C.\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite (respectively, of finite type).\n\nProblem:\nProve that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite (respectively, of finite type).\n\nWait, but in the original question, it's phrased as asking whether the equivalences hold. But the user is having problems with the forward direction (A ⊆ C finite implies A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C finite). So maybe the problem is to determine if the forward implications hold, i.e., does A ⊆ C being finite imply both A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite? Similarly for finite type.\n\nBut the exact problem statement in the original question is: Do we also have the following: (1) A ⊆ C is finite ⇨ A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite. (2) A ⊆ C is of finite type ⇨ A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are of finite type.\n\nSo the problem is to prove or disprove these implications.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings.\n- A is a subring of B.\n- B is a subring of C.\n- A ⊆ C is a finite extension (in the problem for the finite case).\n- A ⊆ C is a finitely generated extension (in the problem for the finite type case).\n\nProblem:\nFor the finite case: Does A ⊆ C being finite imply that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite?\nFor the finite type case: Does A ⊆ C being of finite type imply that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are of finite type?\n\nBut the user is specifically asking about these two implications. The original problem is phrased as asking whether the equivalences hold, but the user is struggling with the forward directions. So perhaps the problem as structured should be:\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that if A ⊆ C is finite, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite. Similarly, prove or disprove that if A ⊆ C is of finite type, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are of finite type.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is just the question to be answered under the assumptions. So in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions would include the setup: A ⊆ B ⊆ C are commutative unital rings. Then the problem is whether A ⊆ C being finite (resp. finite type) implies A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite (resp. finite type). The user is specifically focusing on the forward implications.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to prove or disprove those implications. However, the user might be looking for the answer, but in the format, we just need to structure the problem as per the given instructions.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings.\n- A ⊆ B (as rings).\n- B ⊆ C (as rings).\n- A ⊆ C is finite (for the finite case).\n- A ⊆ C is of finite type (for the finite type case).\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite (resp. of finite type).\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"Do we also have the following: [...]\", so it's a question about whether the equivalence holds. However, the equivalence would be that A ⊆ C is finite iff both A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite. The user knows that for integral extensions, the equivalence holds (as per Grillet), but is asking about finite and finite type. The user is having trouble with the forward direction (⇒). So the problem is to determine if A ⊆ C being finite (resp. finite type) implies A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite (resp. finite type).\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list the assumptions of the rings and the extensions, and the problem is to prove or disprove the implications.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is of finite type.\n\nWait, but for each case (finite and finite type), the problem would be separate. However, in the user's original question, they are two separate implications. So perhaps the assumptions should be split into two problems: one for finite extensions and one for finite type.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed once. But in the example, the original problem had two parts (divisible by 7 and the problem to prove divisibility by 91). Wait, no, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. But actually, in the original example, the user made a mistake. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that's part of the example. Wait, the example given by the user might be their own example, not the actual problem. Let me check.\n\nIn the example provided by the user:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it as an example of the format.\n\nTherefore, following that example's structure, perhaps in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions given in the problem, even if they are part of the general setup. So the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A ⊆ B ⊆ C are ring extensions,\n- A ⊆ C is a finite extension,\n- A ⊆ C is a finitely generated extension.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite/finitely generated. However, the original problem is phrased as two separate implications (for finite and finite type), so perhaps each case should be its own problem. But the user's example combined the two into one problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the general setup (A ⊆ B ⊆ C, commutative unital rings), and the problem is the question about the implications. Then the problem would be: Prove or disprove that if A ⊆ C is finite, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite. Similarly for finite type.\n\nBut the user's example included specific assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) leading to the problem. Here, the assumptions are the rings and the extensions, and the problem is the implication. So, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\nProblem:\nProve that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite.\n\nSimilarly for finite type. But since the user's original question combines both, perhaps we need to split into two problems. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem into the format, so maybe present both cases under the same problem statement, as the original question does.\n\nAlternatively, the user's example had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) leading to the problem. Here, the main assumptions are the ring extensions and the properties of A ⊆ C.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\nProblem:\nProve that the extensions A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite.\n\nAnd similarly for the finite type case. But since the original question asks both, maybe it's better to present both in the same problem statement as two parts.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is stated as a single problem. So perhaps the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is of finite type.\n\nBut this might be combining two separate properties. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to split them into two problems. However, the original question is a single post asking about both finite and finite type cases. Therefore, following the example's structure, where the example combined two assumptions into one problem, we need to structure this problem similarly.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7). That might have been a mistake, but following that, maybe the user wants to list all given assumptions as separate lines. In the current problem, the given assumptions are:\n\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A ⊆ B ⊆ C,\n- Recall definitions of finite/finite type/integral extensions,\n- The result for integral extensions is known (but this is background info, not an assumption),\n- The user is struggling with the forward directions for finite and finite type.\n\nBut according to the instructions, we need to filter out unrelated information. The key assumptions are the rings and the extensions, and the condition that A ⊆ C is finite (or finite type). The rest (integral case, direct summand) are part of the discussion but not assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\nProblem:\nProve that the extensions A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite.\n\nAnd similarly for finite type. But the original question asks both, so perhaps two separate problem structures, but according to the example, it's combined.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is as stated in the original question: Do we have that A ⊆ C is finite ⇨ A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite, and similarly for finite type. So the problem is to prove or disprove these two implications.\n\nThus, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is of finite type.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that:\n1. If A ⊆ C is finite, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite.\n2. If A ⊆ C is of finite type, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are of finite type.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem as a single statement. So maybe split into two problems. However, the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format, implying one problem per instance. Since the original post has two separate questions (finite and finite type), perhaps they should be formatted as two separate problems. However, the user hasn't specified that. Given the example combines multiple conditions into the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) for a single problem, perhaps here we need to present each case (finite and finite type) as separate problems.\n\nBut the user's original question is about both, so perhaps it's better to include both in the problem statement, given that the assumptions are the same except for the property (finite vs finite type). To follow the example's structure, perhaps list all relevant assumptions and state the problem as two parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer should be structured as two separate formatted problems. But the user's instruction shows one example for one problem, so perhaps the answer should be two formatted blocks. However, the user hasn't specified, and they probably expect one formatted problem encompassing both parts as in the original question.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best approach is:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that the extensions A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite.\n\nAnd similarly for the finite type case. But to present both in one structured format as per the original question. However, the example had only one problem. Therefore, the answer would need to present two formatted blocks, one for finite and one for finite type. But the user's example only had one. Since the original question is about both, maybe we need to structure them together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the two into one problem statement. Given the user's example, they combined two assumptions into one problem. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is of finite type.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that the extensions A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite and of finite type, respectively.\n\nBut this is not precise. The problem is two separate implications: if A ⊆ C is finite, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite; and similarly for finite type. Therefore, to accurately reflect the original question, the problem should be stated as two parts under the same assumption.\n\nBut given the format's example, which had a single problem statement, perhaps the answer should present two separate formatted blocks. However, the user's instruction might expect one structured problem. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nGiven the user's example, the formatted problem combined multiple assumptions and presented a single problem. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is of finite type.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that:\n1. If A ⊆ C is finite, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite.\n2. If A ⊆ C is of finite type, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are of finite type.\n\nBut the problem statement should be concise. Alternatively, since the user mentions two separate implications, perhaps structure each as a separate problem. However, the user's example didn't do that.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the most accurate structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite.\n\nAnd another formatted block for finite type. But since the user's example only had one, perhaps the answer should be two separate formatted blocks. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\" (singular). Therefore, considering the original question as one problem with two parts, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is of finite type.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that:\n1. If A ⊆ C is finite, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite.\n2. If A ⊆ C is of finite type, then A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are of finite type.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a single statement. Therefore, perhaps the answer should list the assumptions once and the problem as two separate statements. However, the example's format has the problem as a single statement, so perhaps the user wants each case (finite and finite type) as separate formatted problems.\n\nBut given the instructions, I think the correct approach is to present each implication as a separate formatted problem. Therefore, two separate formatted blocks:\n\nFirst for finite extensions:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are finite.\n\nSecond for finite type:\n\nAssumption:\n- A, B, C are commutative unital rings,\n- A is a subring of B,\n- B is a subring of C,\n- The extension A ⊆ C is of finite type.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C are of finite type.\n\nBut since the user's original question combines both into one, maybe it's better to structure it as one formatted problem with both parts. However, according to the example, it's a single problem. Therefore, compromise by listing both in the problem statement.\n\nFinal answer:",
