    "Content": "I've read that one may prove that all irreducible representations of $SO(3)$ are tensor product representations of the fundamental representation (or tensor product representations of the spin 1/2 representation if we're allowing projective reps). How would one go about proving this? I've only ever done representation theory from a physicist's viewpoint, so I feel like I'm missing the tools to rigorously show it! Many thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think I can help with this one, too, though I'm only going to give a sketch.  I think the details are worked out somewhere in the lecture notes I linked to in my comment on your last question. First you should understand why the corresponding result (that every irrep is the tensor product of the fundamental representation) for $SU(2)$ is true.  To begin, note that any representation of $SU(2)$ restricts to a representation of a $U(1)$ subgroup, so by decomposing a $SU(2)$ irrep into $U(1)$ irreps we see that every irrep of $SU(2)$ has the form $e^{i\\theta k_1} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus e^{i \\theta k_n}$ .  Here the $k_i$ 's are integers, and conjugating with the matrix $$\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{array}\\right)$$ shows that $-k_i$ is an exponent whenever $k_i$ is.  If the chosen $U(1)$ subgroup is generated by the basis vector $X_1$ for the Lie algebra of $SU(2)$ , then it turns out that the eigenvalues of $X_1$ are simply $k_i/2$ (the $2$ comes from the fact that $SO(3)$ is a simply connected Lie group with the same Lie algebra as $SU(2)$ and $SU(2)$ double covers $SO(3)$ ).  Using the other two directions in the Lie algebra of $SU(2)$ , one can construct operators $X_+$ and $X_-$ (the \"raising and lowering\" or \"creation and annihilation\" operators) such that $X_+$ sends any $k/2$ -eigenvector of $X_1$ to either $0$ or a $k/2 + 1$ -eigenvector of $X_1$ and similarly for $X_-$ . This tells you exactly what irreps of $SU(2)$ have to look like: pick an eigenvector $v$ of $X_1$ whose eigenvalue $n/2$ is as large as possible (a \"highest weight\" vector), and repeatedly apply $X_-$ .  You'll generate a list of eigenvectors of $X_1$ with eigenvalues $-n/2, -n/2 + 1, \\ldots, n/2-1, n/2$ .  None of this depended on which $X_1$ we started with, so in fact this sequence of numbers determines the irrep up to conjugation.  Moreover any such sequence can be obtained by tensoring the fundamental representation (direct calculation), so we're done. If you believe all of this works for $SU(2)$ , then $SO(3)$ is easy.  Every $SO(3)$ irrep gives rise to a $SU(2)$ irrep via the double cover $SU(2) \\to SO(3)$ , so we have already constrained the list of possible $SO(3)$ representations dramatically.  The list can be restricted further by noting that a representation of $SU(2)$ descends to a representation of $SO(3)$ if and only if $-1$ goes to the identity, and this holds only when the largest eigenvalue $n/2$ is an integer, i.e. the dimension of the representation is odd.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to find all irreducible representations of SO(3). First, I need to recall what SO(3) is. It's the special orthogonal group in three dimensions, consisting of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. The task is to show that all its irreducible representations are tensor products of the fundamental representation or spin 1/2 if projective reps are allowed.\n\nWait, the original question mentions tensor products of the fundamental representation. The fundamental representation of SO(3) is the 3-dimensional one, acting on vectors. But in physics, especially with angular momentum, we talk about spin representations. Spin 1/2 is a projective representation since it's a double cover, related to SU(2), which covers SO(3) twice. So maybe the problem is connecting the algebraic approach to the physicist's method using angular momentum quantum numbers.\n\nThe user is coming from a physics background, so they might be familiar with the ladder operators and the classification via integer and half-integer spins. But mathematically, irreducible representations of SO(3) correspond to integer spins only, while SU(2) includes half-integers. Since SO(3) is SU(2)/{±I}, projective representations of SO(3) would be genuine representations of SU(2). But the question allows projective reps, so maybe spin 1/2 is included here.\n\nThe key steps would involve showing that any irreducible representation can be built by symmetrized tensor products of the fundamental rep. For example, the symmetric tensor product of n copies of the fundamental gives the spin-n representation. But for SO(3), only integer spins are allowed. However, if we consider projective representations (i.e., representations up to a phase), then we include half-integers via SU(2).\n\nBut how to structure this into assumptions and the problem? The original example filtered assumptions. The problem here might not have explicit numerical conditions but structural ones. The assumptions would relate to the properties of SO(3), its representations, and perhaps allowing projective ones. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nThe user says: \"prove that all irreducible representations of SO(3) are tensor product representations of the fundamental representation (or tensor product of spin 1/2 if allowing projective reps).\" So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The group in question is SO(3).\n2. Considering finite-dimensional representations.\n3. Irreducible representations are sought.\n4. Projective representations are allowed (for the spin 1/2 case).\n\nBut in the example provided, assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group is SO(3),\nThe representations are finite-dimensional,\nThe representations are irreducible,\nProjective representations are permitted (for part involving spin 1/2).\n\nProblem: Find all irreducible representations of SO(3), showing they are tensor products of the fundamental representation or tensor products of the spin 1/2 representation (if projective representations are allowed).\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"prove that all irreducible representations...\" So maybe the problem statement is to prove that all irreducible reps are tensor products of the fundamental or spin 1/2 (if projective). But how precise should the assumptions be? Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nG = SO(3),\nRepresentations are over the complex numbers,\nFinite-dimensional representations,\nIrreducible representations considered,\nProjective representations allowed (when considering spin 1/2).\n\nBut the original example had specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more about the structure. The key is to filter the user's question into the format. The user mentions that they want to prove all irreps are tensor products of the fundamental or spin 1/2 (if projective). The assumptions need to be the given conditions. The original question doesn't state explicit numerical conditions but context about the group and type of representations.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be the group (SO(3)), the type of representations (irreducible), and allowing projective ones. The problem is to find all such reps as tensor products of fundamental or spin 1/2. So structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group is SO(3),\nRepresentations are irreducible,\nFinite-dimensional complex representations,\nProjective representations are allowed (for spin 1/2 case).\n\nProblem: Prove that all irreducible representations of SO(3) are tensor products of the fundamental representation or tensor products of the spin 1/2 representation (when allowing projective representations).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the group and representation properties are the assumptions. I think that's the way to go. So yes, each assumption is a single property. So each line is one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nG is the Lie group SO(3),\nRepresentations are finite-dimensional,\nRepresentations are irreducible,\nRepresentations are over the complex field,\nProjective representations are permitted.\n\nProblem: Prove that every irreducible representation of SO(3) is a tensor product representation derived from the fundamental representation or, when allowing projective representations, derived from the spin 1/2 representation.\n\nBut maybe \"tensor product representations derived from\" can be phrased as \"tensor product of the fundamental representation\". The original question says \"tensor product representations of the fundamental\". Wait, but tensor products of the fundamental would be like tensoring it multiple times. However, in representation theory, the irreducible reps of SO(3) are symmetric tensors, so maybe the spin-k representation is the symmetric tensor product of 2k copies of the fundamental? Not exactly. Wait, the fundamental is spin 1. The spin k representation has dimension 2k+1. So for integer k, that's the symmetric tensor product of 2k copies? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that all irreps are subrepresentations of tensor products of the fundamental representation. Because in general, for Lie groups, you can generate all irreps by taking tensor products of the fundamental and then decomposing. But for SO(3), maybe the fundamental is the vector representation (dim 3), and its symmetric powers give the higher integer spin reps. So the problem might be stating that all irreps are contained in tensor products of the fundamental, or spin 1/2 if you allow projective. But spin 1/2 isn't a representation of SO(3) but of its double cover SU(2). So projective reps of SO(3) are genuine reps of SU(2).\n\nSo to translate the user's problem into the format, the assumptions are about the group, type of reps, allowing projective. The problem is to show that all such irreps come from tensor products of fundamental or spin 1/2 (if projective allowed).\n\nThus, the formatted problem should list the group, the type of representations, finite-dimensional, irreps, allowing projective. The problem is to prove they're all tensor products of the fundamental or spin 1/2 (projective case). So the final answer would structure that.",
