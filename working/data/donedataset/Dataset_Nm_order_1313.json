    "Content": "I can prove that commutator is minimal subgroup such that factor group of it is abelian. I had encountered one statement as If $H$ is a subgroup containing commutator subgroup then $H$ is\n  normal. I.e. we have to show that $\\forall g\\in G$ such that $gHg^{-1}=H$ with fact that $G'\\subset H$ It is for elements in $G'$ to show condition for normality. But how to do for elements not in $G'$ but in $H$ , that is in $H\\setminus G'$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $g\\in G$ and $h\\in H$, then $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}=h'$, for some $h'\\in H$ (since $H$ contains the commutator subgroup). But then $ghg^{-1}=h'h\\in H$. Therefore, $gHg^{-1}\\subset H$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The task is to list all assumptions line by line and then state the problem. \n\nFirst, the original question is about proving that any subgroup containing the commutator subgroup is normal. The user mentioned they can prove that the commutator is the minimal subgroup such that the factor group is abelian. The main problem here is to show that if H is a subgroup containing G' (the commutator subgroup), then H is normal in G. \n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points are:\n\n1. H is a subgroup of G.\n2. H contains the commutator subgroup G'.\n3. We need to prove H is normal in G, meaning for all g in G, gHg^{-1} = H.\n\nEach assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\n- The first assumption is that H is a subgroup of G. That's straightforward.\n- The second assumption is that H contains G', the commutator subgroup. So G' is a subset of H.\n- The problem is to show H is normal in G. \n\nWait, are there more assumptions? The user didn't mention any other conditions. The original problem doesn't specify any restrictions on G, like being finite or abelian. So probably, G is just a group, and H is any subgroup containing G'. The key here is that since G' is contained in H, and G' is normal in G (since the commutator subgroup is always normal), but H might be larger. But the problem is to use the fact that H contains G' to show H is normal. \n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n- H contains the commutator subgroup G'.\n\nThe problem is to prove that H is normal in G.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, each applying to one object. So \"H is a subgroup of G\" is one assumption. \"H contains the commutator subgroup G’\" is another. Then the problem is to prove H is normal. \n\nThe example given in the original query had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So here, similarly, separate each condition. \n\nSo the formatted problem should look like:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a subgroup of G,\nH contains the commutator subgroup G'.\nProblem:\nProve that H is normal in G.\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check again. The problem states \"If H is a subgroup containing commutator subgroup then H is normal.\" So the two conditions are H ≤ G and G' ≤ H. The conclusion is H is normal. \n\nNo other hidden assumptions. So the answer should follow that structure.",
