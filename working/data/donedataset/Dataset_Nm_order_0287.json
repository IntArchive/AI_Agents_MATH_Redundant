    "Content": "It is commonly known that the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has two solutions given by: $$x = \\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$ But how do I prove that another root couldn't exist? I think derivation of quadratic formula is not enough....",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose there are three distinct roots $x,y,z$. One has\n$$\\begin{cases}ax^2+bx+c=0\\\\ay^2+by+c=0\\\\az^2+bz+c=0\\end{cases}\\Rightarrow\\begin{cases}a(x^2-y^2)+b(x-y)=0\\\\a(x^2-z^2)+b(x-z)=0\\end{cases}\\Rightarrow\\begin{cases}a(x+y)+b=0\\\\a(x+z)+b=0\\end{cases}$$ It follows $$a(z-y)=0\\Rightarrow z=y$$ which is a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking why a quadratic equation can only have two roots. They know the quadratic formula gives two solutions but are unsure how to prove there can't be a third root. They mentioned that deriving the quadratic formula isn't sufficient for them, so I need to think of another approach.\n\nFirst, I remember that a quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial, which means its highest power of x is 2. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial of degree n has exactly n roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities. So maybe that's a starting point. But maybe they want a more elementary proof without invoking that theorem.\n\nAnother approach is factorization. If we assume a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 has three distinct roots, then the polynomial can be written as a(x - r1)(x - r2)(x - r3). But expanding that would give a cubic polynomial, which contradicts the original quadratic (degree 2). Therefore, there can't be three distinct roots.\n\nWait, but is that rigorous enough? Maybe I should consider that if a quadratic had more than two roots, then the polynomial would have more than two linear factors, making its degree higher than two. Since the degree is fixed at two, that's impossible. So, this seems like a solid argument using the factor theorem.\n\nAlternatively, think about the graph of a quadratic function, which is a parabola. It can intersect the x-axis at most two times. If it had three roots, the graph would have to cross the axis three times, which isn't possible for a parabola.\n\nBut the user might want an algebraic proof. Let's suppose there are three distinct roots r1, r2, r3. Then, the quadratic equation would satisfy f(r1)=0, f(r2)=0, f(r3)=0. Consider the polynomial f(x) = ax² + bx + c. If it has three roots, then the polynomial f(x) must be divisible by (x - r1)(x - r2)(x - r3), which is a cubic polynomial. However, f(x) is quadratic, so this is impossible unless the cubic polynomial is zero, which would mean a=0, but then it's not a quadratic equation anymore. Hence, contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: using derivatives. If a quadratic equation had three roots, by Rolle's theorem, between each pair of roots there must be a critical point where the derivative is zero. The derivative of a quadratic is linear, so it can have only one critical point. Hence, there can be at most two roots. But maybe this is too advanced for someone who is just learning about quadratics.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we have three roots. Then, subtracting the equations for each root: a(r1² - r2²) + b(r1 - r2) = 0. Factor this as (r1 - r2)(a(r1 + r2) + b) = 0. Since r1 ≠ r2, then a(r1 + r2) + b = 0. Similarly, for r2 and r3: a(r2 + r3) + b = 0. Subtracting these two gives a(r1 - r3) = 0. Since a ≠ 0 (it's a quadratic), this implies r1 = r3, contradicting the assumption of three distinct roots. Therefore, at most two distinct roots.\n\nThis seems like a good algebraic approach. So, by assuming a third root, we derive a contradiction, proving that only two roots are possible.\n\nPutting this all together, the key points are that a quadratic polynomial can't factor into more than two linear terms without increasing its degree, leading to a contradiction. Also, using the properties of equations derived from having three roots leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the maximum number of roots a quadratic equation can have is two.",
