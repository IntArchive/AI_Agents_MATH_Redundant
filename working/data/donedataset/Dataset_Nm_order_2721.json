    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to prove that 2^{222} - 1 is divisible by 3. The user mentioned they split it into (2^{111} - 1)(2^{111} + 1). So they want to show either of those factors is divisible by 3.\n\nFirst, I remember that for divisibility by 3, looking at modulo 3 might help. Let's see. 2 modulo 3 is 2. Then 2^1 is 2 mod 3, 2^2 is 4 which is 1 mod 3. Wait, 2^2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. So the pattern repeats every 2 exponents. So 2^even exponent would be 1 mod 3, and 2^odd exponent would be 2 mod 3.\n\nNow, 2^{111} is 2^(2*55 + 1), which is odd exponent. So 2^{111} ≡ 2 mod 3. Then 2^{111} - 1 would be 2 - 1 = 1 mod 3, and 2^{111} + 1 would be 2 + 1 = 0 mod 3. So the second factor is divisible by 3. Therefore, 2^{222} -1 is divisible by 3.\n\nBut wait, the user's approach was to factor it into (2^111 -1)(2^111 +1). Since one of those factors is divisible by 3, the product is divisible by 3. So the key assumption here is that 222 is even, which allows factoring into difference of squares. But maybe the problem assumes that 222 is an integer, which it is. But do we need any other assumptions? The problem seems straightforward. The original question didn't specify any constraints on the exponent other than it being 222. So the main assumption is that 222 is a positive integer. But since 222 is given, maybe the only assumption needed is that the exponent is 222. But in the example provided, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is specific to 222, so maybe the assumption is that the exponent is 222. But in the problem statement, the user is asking about 2^{222} -1, so maybe no further assumptions are needed beyond the exponent being 222. However, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer. So perhaps here, the assumption is that 222 is an integer. But 222 is a specific integer, so maybe the assumption is redundant. Wait, but the original problem in the example had \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was that n is an integer. Here, the problem is about a specific number, 2^{222}-1. So perhaps the assumption here is that 222 is an integer. But that's trivial because 222 is given as an exponent. So maybe in this case, there are no additional assumptions beyond what's given. But the example included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem doesn't have any conditions beyond the exponent being 222. So maybe the assumption is just that 222 is an integer. But in the example, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted assumption included n being divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, or maybe there was a misunderstanding. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong. Because if the problem is to prove it for every integer n, then the assumption should not restrict n to being divisible by 7. Unless perhaps the original problem had a typo or the example is incorrect. Hmm. That's confusing. But maybe the user intended that in their example, the problem was actually requiring n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem statement was different. So perhaps in their example, there was a mistake.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's instruction, when formatting the problem, we need to list all assumptions line by line. In the current problem, the question is to prove that 2^{222} -1 is divisible by 3. The user factored it as (2^{111} -1)(2^{111} +1), and wants to know which of those factors is divisible by 3.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be that 222 is an integer, but since 222 is given, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the problem's given. However, looking at the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\". So perhaps in this case, the assumption is that the exponent 222 is an integer, which is trivial, but perhaps necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed here because it's a specific number. The problem is about a specific number, 2^{222} -1. So maybe the assumption section is empty. But the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption includes \"n is an integer\". So perhaps here, even though 222 is a specific integer, we still need to list that 222 is an integer as an assumption. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are about the properties used in the proof. For example, using modular arithmetic properties. But no, the assumptions should be the problem's conditions, not the proof's methods.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\"\n\nSo in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps in the example, the original problem was miswritten, or the formatted version added an extra condition. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscommunication. But regardless, following the user's example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the current problem, the problem is \"Prove that 2^{222}-1 is divisible by 3\". There are no additional conditions given; it's a specific number. Therefore, the only assumption could be that 222 is an integer. But since 222 is explicitly given, perhaps that's unnecessary. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions here. But the example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So maybe in this case, the assumption is that 222 is an integer. But since 222 is a specific integer, perhaps it's redundant, but to follow the example, we should include it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed here. But the example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assumption is that 222 is an integer. So:\n\nAssumption:\n222 is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2^{222} - 1$ is divisible by 3.\n\nBut the original problem in the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's condition. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted assumption listed \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless perhaps the original problem was mistyped. For example, maybe the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, the number A(n)...\" but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". So perhaps there was an error in the example. But regardless, following the user's example, in their formatted version, they listed assumptions that might include conditions beyond the problem's original statement. But that seems incorrect. However, since the user provided that example, we have to follow their format, even if the example might have an error.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is to prove that 2^{222}-1 is divisible by 3. There are no additional conditions given. So perhaps the assumption is just that 222 is an integer. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions. But the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem's universal statement. So perhaps here, we need to list that 222 is an integer. However, since 222 is explicitly given, it's inherent. But to adhere strictly to the user's example, let's include it.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the problem assumes knowledge of modular arithmetic or properties of exponents, but those are methods, not assumptions of the problem's conditions. Assumptions here should be about the problem's conditions, not the solver's knowledge. Therefore, the problem's conditions are just the expression given, so no assumptions beyond 222 being an integer. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n222 is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2^{222} - 1$ is divisible by 3.\n\nBut the example's assumption included two points, even though the original problem was for every integer n, the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but since we have to follow their format, perhaps here, even though there's no additional condition, we list 222 as an integer. But in the example, the problem was for every integer n, but the assumption included n is an integer and n divisible by 7, which is contradictory. So perhaps there was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem in the example had a typo, and the correct problem was to prove for n divisible by 7. Given that confusion, it's safer to list the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions. Since this current problem is about a specific exponent, 222, there are no variables, so no assumptions. But the user's example included assumptions even for variables. Therefore, maybe in this case, there are no assumptions, but the format requires at least one. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects that since the problem is about divisibility, the assumption is that we are working in integers. But that's a general mathematical context. It's unclear. Given the example, perhaps the correct approach is to list the exponent as an integer.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n222 is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2^{222} - 1$ is divisible by 3.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user decomposed it into (2^{111} -1)(2^{111} +1), and wants to know how to proceed. The key insight is that one of those factors must be divisible by 3. So the assumption here is that 222 is even, allowing the decomposition into a difference of squares. Wait, 222 is even, so 2^{222} = (2^{111})^2. Therefore, the decomposition is valid. So perhaps the assumption is that 222 is an even integer. But 222 is given as even. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n222 is an even integer.\n\nBut does that matter? The decomposition into (2^{111} -1)(2^{111} +1) requires that the exponent 222 is even, which it is. But is that an assumption or a given? Since 222 is explicitly given, its parity is known. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is not necessary. But if we follow the example where they listed \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", then maybe here, we need to list that 222 is even. But wait, in the example, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the correct assumption was that n is divisible by 7. But in our current problem, the decomposition is possible because 222 is even, so maybe that's an assumption. However, since 222 is even by definition, maybe it's not an assumption but a given. So perhaps the only assumption is that 222 is an integer. But in the example, the assumption included a condition beyond the problem's universal statement. It's confusing. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest is to list 222 as an integer. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n222 is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $2^{222} - 1$ is divisible by 3.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the problem is to factor 2^{222} -1 as a difference of squares, which requires the exponent to be even. Since 222 is even, but perhaps the assumption is that the exponent is even. However, 222 is given, so its parity is fixed. Therefore, the assumption might not be necessary. But following the user's example where they added conditions, perhaps here, the assumption is that 222 is an even integer. Let me check:\n\nIf the exponent was odd, say 111, then 2^{111} -1 would not be a difference of squares. But since 222 is even, it's a difference of squares. Therefore, the decomposition is valid. So the assumption here is that the exponent is even. But since the problem is about 222, which is even, maybe the assumption is that 222 is even. However, since 222 is given as even, perhaps that's not an assumption but a fact. So perhaps the only assumption is that 222 is an integer. But again, this is redundant. However, to adhere to the example's format, where even though n was quantified over all integers, they listed \"n is an integer\", we should do the same here. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumption that 222 is an integer.",
