    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is asking whether every factorial n! is divisible by the sum of its digits in decimal representation, denoted as Σ_d(n!). So, we need to check if for all natural numbers n, Σ_d(n!) divides n!.\n\nFirst, I should start by testing some small values of n to see if the statement holds. Let's compute n! and the sum of its digits for n from 1 upwards.\n\nFor n=1: 1! = 1. The sum of digits is 1. 1 divides 1, so that's okay.\n\nn=2: 2! = 2. Sum of digits is 2. 2 divides 2. Still holds.\n\nn=3: 6. Sum is 6. 6 divides 6. Good.\n\nn=4: 24. Sum is 2+4=6. 24 divided by 6 is 4. So yes.\n\nn=5: 120. Sum is 1+2+0=3. 120 divided by 3 is 40. That works.\n\nn=6: 720. Sum is 7+2+0=9. 720/9=80. Okay.\n\nn=7: 5040. Sum is 5+0+4+0=9. 5040 divided by 9 is 560. So yes.\n\nn=8: 40320. Sum is 4+0+3+2+0=9. 40320/9=4480. Still holds.\n\nn=9: 362880. Sum is 3+6+2+8+8+0=27. 362880 divided by 27 is 13440. That works.\n\nn=10: 3628800. Sum is 3+6+2+8+8+0+0=27. 3628800 /27=134400. Okay.\n\nSo up to n=10, it's true. Maybe continue a bit more.\n\nn=11: 39916800. Sum: 3+9+9+1+6+8+0+0=36. 39916800 /36=1108800. Still works.\n\nn=12: 479001600. Sum:4+7+9+0+0+1+6+0+0=27. 479001600 /27=17740800. Yes.\n\nn=13: 6227020800. Sum:6+2+2+7+0+2+0+8+0+0=27. 6227020800 /27=230630400. Okay.\n\nn=14: 87178291200. Sum:8+7+1+7+8+2+9+1+2+0+0=37? Wait, let's compute again. 8+7=15, +1=16, +7=23, +8=31, +2=33, +9=42, +1=43, +2=45, +0=45, +0=45. So sum is 45. 87178291200 divided by 45 is 1937295360. So yes.\n\nn=15: 1307674368000. Sum:1+3+0+7+6+7+4+3+6+8+0+0+0=1+3=4, +0=4, +7=11, +6=17, +7=24, +4=28, +3=31, +6=37, +8=45, +0=45, +0=45, +0=45. Sum is 45. 1307674368000 /45=29059430400. Works.\n\nn=16: 20922789888000. Let's sum the digits: 2+0+9+2+2+7+8+9+8+8+8+0+0+0. Let's compute step by step: 2, +0=2, +9=11, +2=13, +2=15, +7=22, +8=30, +9=39, +8=47, +8=55, +8=63, +0=63, +0=63, +0=63. So sum is 63. 20922789888000 divided by 63 is approximately 332107775999. Let me check exact division: 63*332107775999 = 63*(332107776000 -1) = 63*332107776000 -63 = 20922789888000 -63 = 20922789887937. But the actual n! is 20922789888000, which is 63 more. Wait, that suggests division isn't exact. Wait, did I compute the sum correctly?\n\nWait n=16: 20922789888000. Let's write the number out: 20,922,789,888,000. So digits: 2,0,9,2,2,7,8,9,8,8,8,0,0,0. Sum: 2+0=2, +9=11, +2=13, +2=15, +7=22, +8=30, +9=39, +8=47, +8=55, +8=63, +0+0+0=63. So sum is 63. Now, 20922789888000 divided by 63. Let me compute 20922789888000 ÷ 63. Let's divide by 9 first: 20922789888000 ÷9=2324754432000. Then divide by 7: 2324754432000 ÷7=332107776000. Because 7*332,107,776,000 = 2,324,754,432,000. So 63*332,107,776,000 = 20,922,789,888,000. So yes, exact division. So n=16 works.\n\nn=17: 355687428096000. Sum of digits: 3+5+5+6+8+7+4+2+8+0+9+6+0+0+0. Let's compute: 3+5=8, +5=13, +6=19, +8=27, +7=34, +4=38, +2=40, +8=48, +0=48, +9=57, +6=63, +0+0+0=63. Sum is 63. 355687428096000 ÷63=5645832192000. So yes.\n\nn=18: 6402373705728000. Sum: 6+4+0+2+3+7+3+7+0+5+7+2+8+0+0+0. Let's compute: 6+4=10, +0=10, +2=12, +3=15, +7=22, +3=25, +7=32, +0=32, +5=37, +7=44, +2=46, +8=54, +0+0+0=54. Sum is 54. 6402373705728000 ÷54=118562476032000. Exact division.\n\nn=19: 121645100408832000. Sum:1+2+1+6+4+5+1+0+0+4+0+8+8+3+2+0+0+0. Let's compute step by step: 1+2=3, +1=4, +6=10, +4=14, +5=19, +1=20, +0=20, +0=20, +4=24, +0=24, +8=32, +8=40, +3=43, +2=45, +0+0+0=45. Sum is 45. 121645100408832000 ÷45=2703224453529600. Correct.\n\nn=20: 2432902008176640000. Sum:2+4+3+2+9+0+2+0+0+8+1+7+6+6+4+0+0+0+0. Let's compute: 2+4=6, +3=9, +2=11, +9=20, +0=20, +2=22, +0=22, +0=22, +8=30, +1=31, +7=38, +6=44, +6=50, +4=54, +0+0+0+0=54. Sum is 54. 2432902008176640000 ÷54=45053740910760000. Yes.\n\nSo up to n=20, it's working. Hmm. But the question is whether this holds for all natural numbers. Maybe there's a point where the sum of digits of n! is not a divisor of n!.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the sum of digits. The sum of digits of a number is congruent to the number modulo 9. So Σ_d(n!) ≡ n! mod 9. Since n! for n ≥6 contains both 2 and 3 as factors, so n! is divisible by 9, so Σ_d(n!) ≡0 mod9. Therefore, Σ_d(n!) is divisible by 9 for n ≥6. But n! is also divisible by 9, so n!/Σ_d(n!) is an integer only if Σ_d(n!) divides n!.\n\nBut even if Σ_d(n!) is a divisor of n!, since Σ_d(n!) is a factor. However, this doesn't necessarily hold for all n. Wait, but up to n=20 it's true. Let's check n=21.\n\nn=21: 51090942171709440000. Let's compute the sum of digits. Let's write the number: 51,090,942,171,709,440,000. So digits: 5,1,0,9,0,9,4,2,1,7,1,7,0,9,4,4,0,0,0,0. Let's sum them: 5+1=6, +0=6, +9=15, +0=15, +9=24, +4=28, +2=30, +1=31, +7=38, +1=39, +7=46, +0=46, +9=55, +4=59, +4=63, +0=63, +0=63, +0=63, +0=63. Sum is 63. Then 51090942171709440000 ÷63=810967336059032000. So exact division.\n\nn=22: 1124000727777607680000. Sum of digits:1+1+2+4+0+0+0+7+2+7+7+7+7+6+0+7+6+8+0+0+0+0. Compute step by step: 1+1=2, +2=4, +4=8, +0+0+0=8, +7=15, +2=17, +7=24, +7=31, +7=38, +7=45, +6=51, +0=51, +7=58, +6=64, +8=72, +0+0+0+0=72. Sum is 72. 1124000727777607680000 ÷72=15611121219133440000. Exact.\n\nn=23: 25852016738884976640000. Sum of digits:2+5+8+5+2+0+1+6+7+3+8+8+8+4+9+7+6+6+4+0+0+0+0. Let's compute: 2+5=7, +8=15, +5=20, +2=22, +0=22, +1=23, +6=29, +7=36, +3=39, +8=47, +8=55, +8=63, +4=67, +9=76, +7=83, +6=89, +6=95, +4=99, +0+0+0+0=99. Sum is 99. 25852016738884976640000 ÷99=261131482210959360000. So yes.\n\nn=24: 620448401733239439360000. Sum digits:6+2+0+4+4+8+4+0+1+7+3+3+2+3+9+4+3+9+3+6+0+0+0+0. Compute:6+2=8, +0=8, +4=12, +4=16, +8=24, +4=28, +0=28, +1=29, +7=36, +3=39, +3=42, +2=44, +3=47, +9=56, +4=60, +3=63, +9=72, +3=75, +6=81, +0+0+0+0=81. Sum is 81. 620448401733239439360000 ÷81=7661708663373326412000. Exact.\n\nn=25: 15511210043330985984000000. Sum digits:1+5+5+1+1+2+1+0+0+4+3+3+3+0+9+8+5+9+8+4+0+0+0+0+0+0. Let's compute:1+5=6, +5=11, +1=12, +2=14, +1=15, +0=15, +0=15, +4=19, +3=22, +3=25, +3=28, +0=28, +9=37, +8=45, +5=50, +9=59, +8=67, +4=71, +0+0+0+0+0+0=71. Sum is 71. Now, n=25: 15511210043330985984000000. Let's check if 71 divides this number. Since 71 is a prime number. We need to see if 71 divides 25!.\n\nBut 25! includes 71 as a factor only if 71 ≤25, which it isn't. Wait, 71 is a prime greater than 25, so 25! is not divisible by 71. Therefore, Σ_d(25!)=71 does not divide 25! because 25! is not divisible by 71. Therefore, the statement is false for n=25.\n\nWait, but wait, is 25! actually not divisible by 71? Since 25! is the product of numbers from 1 to 25, and 71 is larger than 25, so yes, 71 does not divide 25!. Therefore, Σ_d(25!)=71 does not divide 25!, which would mean that the original statement is false for n=25. Therefore, the answer is that the statement is not true for all natural numbers n; there exists a counterexample at n=25.\n\nBut let's verify my calculation of the sum of digits for n=25!.\n\n25! is 15511210043330985984000000. Let's write out the number:\n\n15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000.\n\nBreaking down the digits:\n\n1,5,5,1,1,2,1,0,0,4,3,3,3,0,9,8,5,9,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nLet's recount:\n\nDigits: 1,5,5,1,1,2,1,0,0,4,3,3,3,0,9,8,5,9,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nSo positions:\n\n1:1\n2:5\n3:5\n4:1\n5:1\n6:2\n7:1\n8:0\n9:0\n10:4\n11:3\n12:3\n13:3\n14:0\n15:9\n16:8\n17:5\n18:9\n19:8\n20:4\n21:0\n22:0\n23:0\n24:0\n25:0\n26:0\n\nNow summing:\n\n1+5=6; +5=11; +1=12; +1=13; +2=15; +1=16; +0=16; +0=16; +4=20; +3=23; +3=26; +3=29; +0=29; +9=38; +8=46; +5=51; +9=60; +8=68; +4=72; then zeros: 72+0+0+0+0+0+0=72.\n\nWait, I must have miscounted earlier. Wait, here the sum is 72, not 71. So maybe my previous calculation was wrong. Let's check again.\n\nWait, the digits are:\n\nPosition 1:1\n\n2:5\n\n3:5\n\n4:1\n\n5:1\n\n6:2\n\n7:1\n\n8:0\n\n9:0\n\n10:4\n\n11:3\n\n12:3\n\n13:3\n\n14:0\n\n15:9\n\n16:8\n\n17:5\n\n18:9\n\n19:8\n\n20:4\n\n21:0\n\n22:0\n\n23:0\n\n24:0\n\n25:0\n\n26:0\n\nSo sum is:\n\n1+5=6\n\n+5=11\n\n+1=12\n\n+1=13\n\n+2=15\n\n+1=16\n\n+0+0=16\n\n+4=20\n\n+3+3+3=29\n\n+0=29\n\n+9=38\n\n+8=46\n\n+5=51\n\n+9=60\n\n+8=68\n\n+4=72\n\n+0+0+0+0+0+0=72.\n\nSo Σ_d(25!)=72, not 71. Therefore, my previous calculation was incorrect. Therefore, sum is 72. Then 72 divides 25!?\n\n25! is divisible by 72 because 72=8*9. Since 25! has plenty of factors of 2 and 3. Specifically, 25! has more than 3 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 3. Therefore, 72 divides 25!.\n\nSo 25! divided by 72 is an integer. Therefore, for n=25, it still holds. Then where is the first counterexample?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous step. Let me check n=23 again. Wait, n=23: sum was 99. 99 divides 23!? 23! includes factors 9 and 11, so 99=9*11. 23! has multiples of both 9 and 11, so 99 divides 23!.\n\nn=25 sum is 72. 72 divides 25!.\n\nWait, let's check n=27.\n\nn=27: 10888869450418352160768000000. Let's compute the sum of digits. This might be time-consuming, but perhaps there's a better approach. Alternatively, maybe the first counterexample is higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of digits of n! is always a divisor of n! for all n. But that seems unlikely. However, up to n=25, it holds. Maybe n=27 or higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n=49. Let's try n=49. However, calculating the sum of digits of 49! manually is impractical. Alternatively, I can consider that for large n, n! has many trailing zeros, so the sum of digits might not be too large. But 49! has a lot of digits and the sum might still be a factor. Alternatively, perhaps at some point, the sum of digits becomes a prime number greater than n, which would not divide n!.\n\nFor example, if Σ_d(n!) is a prime number p where p > n, then since p does not divide n!, the sum would not divide n!.\n\nSo the idea is to find an n where Σ_d(n!) is a prime number. But is that possible?\n\nBut for n ≥5, n! is divisible by 10, so it ends with zeros. Therefore, the sum of digits would include the digits before the trailing zeros. The sum of digits of n! tends to increase with n, but given the trailing zeros, the sum might not grow too rapidly.\n\nBut can Σ_d(n!) be a prime number?\n\nFor example, n=5: sum is 3 (1+2+0=3). 3 is prime. But n=5, 3 divides 120, so 120/3=40. So even though the sum is prime, it divides n!.\n\nBut suppose for some n, Σ_d(n!)=p where p is a prime greater than n. Then since p> n, p does not divide n!, so Σ_d(n!) does not divide n!.\n\nTherefore, we need to find an n where Σ_d(n!) is a prime number greater than n.\n\nIs there such an n?\n\nLet me check n=5: sum=3, which is prime and 3<=5. So okay.\n\nn=7: sum=9, which is composite.\n\nn=11: sum=36, composite.\n\nn=13: sum=27, composite.\n\nn=17: sum=63, composite.\n\nn=19: sum=45, composite.\n\nn=23: sum=99, composite.\n\nn=25: sum=72, composite.\n\nn=29: Need to compute sum of digits of 29!.\n\nBut calculating 29! manually is tough. Alternatively, perhaps using properties.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that for large n, n! has a lot of trailing zeros (due to factors 2 and 5), so the last non-zero digits might contribute to the sum. However, the sum can still be large. But whether it is prime is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n=4. Let me check n=4: sum=2+4=6, composite.\n\nn=3: sum=6, composite.\n\nn=2: sum=2, prime, but 2 divides 2!.\n\nSo the first possible candidate would be where Σ_d(n!) is a prime number greater than n.\n\nBut is there such n?\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=49, but without computational tools, hard to check.\n\nAlternatively, refer to known literature. I recall that this problem has been discussed before, and the counterexample is n=432. But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, according to some references, the smallest counterexample is n=432, but I might need to check. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is true for all n except for some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that the statement is false, and a counterexample exists. But based on manual checking up to n=25, it holds. So maybe the user needs to prove or disprove.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to prove it's true. But since up to n=25 it's true, but the user asks to prove or disprove. Therefore, the answer is that it's not true for all n, there exists a counterexample.\n\nBut without finding a specific counterexample, it's hard. However, in research, it's known that the sum of digits of n! does not always divide n!. For example, according to some sources, n=432 is a counterexample where the sum is 3893, which is a prime, and 432! is not divisible by 3893. However, I need to verify this.\n\nAssuming that such a counterexample exists, the answer would be to disprove it by providing a counterexample. But since the user asks to prove/disprove, and if we can't compute large factorials manually, we can reason based on properties.\n\nGiven that the sum of digits can be a prime larger than n, which doesn't divide n!, hence the statement is false. Therefore, the answer is that the statement is false, with a counterexample at n=432 or similar.\n\nBut given that the user is asking to present the problem in the specified format, the original problem is to prove or disprove that for all n ∈ N, Σ_d(n!) divides n!.\n\nThe formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nn is a natural number,\nΣ_d(t) denotes the sum of digits of t in decimal.\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for every natural number n, Σ_d(n!) divides n!.\n\nBut according to the example given, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So in the original problem, the assumptions are that n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn the current problem, the user writes:\n\nOriginal title: Is every factorial divisible by its sum of digits?\nQuestion: Denote by Σ_d(t) the sum of digits in the decimal representation of the number t. Prove / disprove: ∀n∈N: Σ_d(n!) | n!.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have assumptions:\n\nAssumption: n is a natural number,\nΣ_d(t) is the sum of digits of t in decimal.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that Σ_d(n!) divides n!.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions should list conditions applied to one object. Here, the problem defines Σ_d(t) as the sum of digits, which is a notation introduction. The assumption here is that n is a natural number, and Σ_d(t) is defined as the sum of digits. However, in the example, assumptions were about the properties of n (being integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem is to prove a statement for all natural numbers n, with Σ_d defined as sum of digits. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: n is a natural number,\nΣ_d(t) is the sum of the digits of t in base 10.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that Σ_d(n!) divides n!.\n\nBut the example's assumption included the divisibility condition. Since in this problem, there are no additional conditions on n except being a natural number. Therefore, the assumptions would be n is a natural number, and Σ_d is defined as sum of digits.
