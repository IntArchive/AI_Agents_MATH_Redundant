    "Content": "I have recently read in a script about statistical methods in a chapter about linear regression that: Given an $n \\times k$ -matrix $A$ , we have $$A^T A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^T a_i$$ where $a_i$ denotes the $i$ -th row of $A$ . Unfortunately, the author doesn't give a proof of that and I can't figure out one myself. Maybe someone can help me. source: script on page 10",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The problem is about proving that for a given n×k matrix A, the matrix product A transpose multiplied by A is equal to the sum of the outer products of each row vector a_i with itself, summed from i=1 to n. The user mentioned that the author didn't provide a proof, and they're seeking help.\n\nNow, applying the format. The example given shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem for assumptions. The matrix A is an n×k matrix. The rows of A are a_i, which are 1×k vectors. The operation A^T A is being considered, and the equality to the sum of a_i^T a_i for each row.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. A is an n×k matrix. (This defines the dimensions of A.)\n2. Each a_i is the i-th row of A. (Specifies what a_i represents.)\n3. Each a_i is a row vector, so when transposed, a_i^T becomes a column vector. (This is implicit but necessary for the outer product.)\n\nWait, but do I need to list all these? The original problem states that A is an n×k matrix and a_i is the i-th row. The rest might be part of the problem's context rather than assumptions. The example given in the prompt had assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in that case, the assumptions were specific conditions. Here, the problem is more about matrix dimensions and definitions.\n\nSo translating into the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is an n×k matrix.\n- a_i denotes the i-th row of A for each i from 1 to n.\n\nProblem: Prove that A^T A equals the sum from i=1 to n of a_i^T a_i.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"we have A^T A = sum...\" which is the statement to prove. So the problem is to prove that equality. The assumptions are the given conditions, which are the structure of matrix A and the definition of a_i as rows.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is one line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×k matrix.\nEach a_i is the i-th row of A.\n\nBut wait, maybe split into two: one about the matrix dimensions and one about the definition of a_i. Because each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, yes, two assumptions:\n\n1. A is an n×k matrix.\n2. For each i, a_i is the i-th row of A.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that A^T A equals the sum of a_i^T a_i over i=1 to n.\n\nI think that's correct. The example in the prompt included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in this case, the problem doesn't have such a condition; it's a general statement about any n×k matrix. So the assumptions here are just the definitions needed to set up the problem. The problem is to prove the given equation.",
