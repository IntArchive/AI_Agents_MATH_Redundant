    "Content": "I've been self-studying inseparable extensions and there's something that seems obvious to everybody but not to me. Let's clear out some definitions that are not so universal: Let $K$ be a field and $f\\in K[X]$ a polynomial. We say it is separable if all its roots are distinct over its splitting field. We say it is purely inseparable if it has only one root over its splitting field, and this root is multiple. A field extension $F\\subset K$ is purely inseparable (resp. separable ) if every element of $K$ is the root of a purely inseparable (resp. *separable) polynomial in $F[X]$. A field K is perfect if every irreducible polynomial over K is separable. Let $F\\subset K$ be a field extension of characteristic $p$. The perfect closure , or purely inseparable closure of $F$ in $K$ is the greatest intermediate field that is purely inseparable over $F$. We will denote it by $K^p_F$ We can prove that $K^p_F$ consists of all the elements $\\alpha\\in K$ such that there is $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\alpha^{p^n}\\in F$. Another property that may be useful is that an irreducible polynomial over a field of characteristic $p$ splits on its splitting field like this: $$f(X)= a_0(X-a_1)^{p^n} \\dots (X-a_r)^{p^n}$$ where the $a_1,\\dots,a_r$ are pairwise distinct. Now, why is it true that $K^p_F$ is a perfect field? Please try to prove it only using these definitions and properties. EDIT: I have also proved that A field is perfect iff every finite extension is separable, iff every algebraic \n  extension is separable. which may come in handy.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The answer to your question is, that it isn't necessarily true that $K_F^p$ is a perfect field. For example, let $F$ be any non-perfect field (e.g. $\\mathbb{F}_p(T)$), and let $K=F$, so that we must have $K_F^p=F$. When $K=\\bar{F}$, an algebraic closure of $F$, then $K_F^p$ is the smallest perfect subfield of $K$ containing $F$, hence the name \"perfect closure\". This is Lemma 3.16 in Karpilovsky's Field Theory (for some reason I couldn't find this in a more standard reference like Lang). As you mention, $K_F^p$ consists of those $\\alpha\\in K$ such that $\\alpha^{p^n}\\in F$ for some $n$, and note that the field that Karpilovsky refers to as the perfect closure is\n$$F^{p^{-\\infty}}=\\{a\\in\\bar{F}\\mid a^{p^n}\\in F \\text{ for some }n\\geq0\\}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem: proving that the perfect closure \\( K^p_F \\) is a perfect field. Hmm, first, I need to recall the definitions given here. \n\nSo, a perfect field is one where every irreducible polynomial over it is separable. And a separable polynomial has all distinct roots in its splitting field. The perfect closure \\( K^p_F \\) is the largest intermediate field between F and K that's purely inseparable over F. Also, elements in \\( K^p_F \\) are those α in K such that some power \\( α^{p^n} \\) is in F, where p is the characteristic of the field.\n\nWait, the problem says to use the given definitions and properties. Let me list them out again to make sure I don't miss anything. \n\nDefinitions:\n1. Separable polynomial: all roots are distinct in splitting field.\n2. Purely inseparable polynomial: only one root (with multiplicity) in splitting field.\n3. Purely inseparable extension: every element in the extension is a root of a purely inseparable polynomial over the base field.\n4. Perfect field: every irreducible polynomial over it is separable.\n5. Perfect closure \\( K^p_F \\): greatest intermediate field purely inseparable over F, consisting of elements α where \\( α^{p^n} \\in F \\) for some n.\n\nProperties mentioned:\n- Irreducible polynomial in characteristic p splits as \\( f(X) = a_0(X - a_1)^{p^n} \\dots (X - a_r)^{p^n} \\) with distinct \\( a_i \\).\n- A field is perfect iff every finite extension is separable, iff every algebraic extension is separable.\n\nSo the goal is to show \\( K^p_F \\) is perfect. That means any irreducible polynomial over \\( K^p_F \\) must be separable. Let's take an irreducible polynomial \\( f \\in K^p_F[X] \\). Need to show that all its roots are distinct.\n\nBut since \\( K^p_F \\) is a field of characteristic p (since it's an extension of F, which is in characteristic p), maybe we can use the splitting property. Suppose f is irreducible over \\( K^p_F \\). If we can show that f is separable, which would require that in its splitting field, all roots are distinct. \n\nAlternatively, since the user mentioned another property: a field is perfect iff every algebraic extension is separable. So if we can show that every algebraic extension of \\( K^p_F \\) is separable, then \\( K^p_F \\) is perfect. But maybe it's easier to use the definition directly.\n\nLet me think. Suppose f is an irreducible polynomial over \\( K^p_F \\). Suppose for contradiction that f is not separable. Then it has a repeated root. But in characteristic p, inseparable irreducible polynomials must have the form \\( g(X^{p^m}) \\) for some separable g. Wait, but in the properties given, the user says that in characteristic p, an irreducible polynomial splits as \\( a_0 \\prod (X - a_i)^{p^n} \\). Wait, but if the polynomial is irreducible, how can it split into multiple factors unless it's a power? Wait, maybe that's after extending to the splitting field. Wait, the property states that over its splitting field, an irreducible polynomial in characteristic p splits into linear factors each raised to a power of p^n. So if f is irreducible over \\( K^p_F \\), then in its splitting field, it would look like \\( f(X) = a_0(X - a_1)^{p^n} \\dots (X - a_r)^{p^n} \\). But if it's irreducible over \\( K^p_F \\), then in the splitting field, the roots are conjugates, so each factor would have the same exponent. But if all exponents are p^n, then maybe we can take the p^n-th root? But how does this help?\n\nWait, but for f to be inseparable, it must have a repeated root. But according to the splitting, all roots have multiplicity p^n. If p^n > 1, then the polynomial is not separable. But we need to show that over \\( K^p_F \\), such a polynomial cannot exist. So perhaps the minimal polynomial of any element in an algebraic extension of \\( K^p_F \\) is separable. \n\nAlternatively, since \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F, but we need to show it's perfect. Let me recall that in characteristic p, a field is perfect if and only if every element has a p-th root. Wait, but that's another characterization. But according to the problem's edit, the user has shown that a field is perfect iff every algebraic extension is separable. So maybe we can use that.\n\nSo to show \\( K^p_F \\) is perfect, we can show that every algebraic extension of \\( K^p_F \\) is separable. Let’s take an algebraic extension L of \\( K^p_F \\). We need to show that L is separable over \\( K^p_F \\). \n\nBut \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F. So F ⊂ \\( K^p_F \\) ⊂ L. Now, L is an algebraic extension of \\( K^p_F \\). If we can show that L is separable over \\( K^p_F \\), then by the property, \\( K^p_F \\) is perfect.\n\nAlternatively, take any element α in L. We need to show that the minimal polynomial of α over \\( K^p_F \\) is separable. Let’s denote this minimal polynomial as f ∈ \\( K^p_F[X] \\). If f is separable, we are done. Suppose f is not separable. Then, since we are in characteristic p, f must be of the form f(X) = g(X^{p^m}) where g is separable. But then, α^{p^m} is a root of g, which is separable. So α^{p^m} is separable over \\( K^p_F \\). But since \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F, any element in \\( K^p_F \\) has some p^power in F. \n\nWait, if α is in L, which is an extension of \\( K^p_F \\), then the minimal polynomial f of α over \\( K^p_F \\) is irreducible. If f is not separable, then as in characteristic p, f(X) = h(X^{p^m}) for some separable h. So α^{p^m} is separable over \\( K^p_F \\). But since \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F, then α^{p^m} is also purely inseparable over F. Wait, but if α^{p^m} is in \\( K^p_F \\), then since \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F, the extension F(α^{p^m}) is purely inseparable. But if α^{p^m} is separable over F, then it must be both separable and purely inseparable over F, which implies it's in F. Wait, because if an element is both separable and purely inseparable over F, it must be in F. \n\nBut α^{p^m} is in \\( K^p_F \\), and \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F. So, α^{p^m} is purely inseparable over F. But if α^{p^m} is separable over \\( K^p_F \\), which is itself purely inseparable over F, then maybe α^{p^m} is both separable and purely inseparable over F, hence in F. \n\nWait, let's think step by step. Let’s take β = α^{p^m}. Then β is separable over \\( K^p_F \\). But β is in \\( K^p_F \\), since \\( K^p_F \\) is a field. Wait, no. Wait, α is in L, which is an extension of \\( K^p_F \\). Then β = α^{p^m} is in L, and β is a root of h(X), which is a separable polynomial over \\( K^p_F \\). So β is separable over \\( K^p_F \\). But \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F. So the extension \\( K^p_F \\) (β) / \\( K^p_F \\) is separable, and since \\( K^p_F \\) / F is purely inseparable, then by tower properties, F ⊂ \\( K^p_F \\) ⊂ \\( K^p_F \\)(β). The extension \\( K^p_F \\)(β) / F is both separable and purely inseparable? Wait, no. If \\( K^p_F \\)(β)/ \\( K^p_F \\) is separable, and \\( K^p_F \\)/F is purely inseparable, then the composite extension \\( K^p_F \\)(β)/F is separable over \\( K^p_F \\), but since \\( K^p_F \\)/F is purely inseparable, then the whole extension \\( K^p_F \\)(β)/F is both separable and purely inseparable, hence it's trivial, so \\( K^p_F \\)(β) = F, which can't be unless β is already in F. \n\nWait, that might be the key. If β is separable over \\( K^p_F \\), then \\( K^p_F \\)(β)/ \\( K^p_F \\) is separable. But \\( K^p_F \\)/F is purely inseparable, so the tower F ⊂ \\( K^p_F \\) ⊂ \\( K^p_F \\)(β) would imply that \\( K^p_F \\)(β)/F is both separable (because it's separable over \\( K^p_F \\), and \\( K^p_F \\)/F is purely inseparable) and purely inseparable (since it's an extension of a purely inseparable extension). Therefore, such an extension must be trivial, meaning \\( K^p_F \\)(β) = \\( K^p_F \\), so β is in \\( K^p_F \\). But β is already in \\( K^p_F \\), because β = α^{p^m} and α is in L, which is an extension of \\( K^p_F \\). Wait, no, β is in L, but not necessarily in \\( K^p_F \\). Wait, but we have β is a root of h(X), which is a separable polynomial over \\( K^p_F \\), so β is algebraic over \\( K^p_F \\). If \\( K^p_F \\)(β)/ \\( K^p_F \\) is separable and \\( K^p_F \\)/F is purely inseparable, then by a theorem, the composite of a separable and purely inseparable extension is the whole field, but in this case, the extension would have to be both separable and purely inseparable over F, hence trivial. Therefore, β must lie in \\( K^p_F \\). So β is in \\( K^p_F \\). Therefore, β^{p^n} is in F for some n, because elements of \\( K^p_F \\) have some p-power in F. So β^{p^n} = (α^{p^m})^{p^n} = α^{p^{m + n}} ∈ F. But since \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F, β is in \\( K^p_F \\), so β^{p^n} ∈ F for some n. Therefore, α^{p^{m + n}} ∈ F. Therefore, α is in \\( K^p_F \\), because \\( K^p_F \\) contains all elements of K that have some p-power in F. Wait, but L is an arbitrary extension of \\( K^p_F \\), and α is in L. If we show that α must be in \\( K^p_F \\), then L = \\( K^p_F \\), which is only possible if every algebraic extension is trivial, meaning \\( K^p_F \\) is perfect. \n\nWait, I might be mixing things up. Let's recap. Suppose L is an algebraic extension of \\( K^p_F \\). Take any α in L. Let f be the minimal polynomial of α over \\( K^p_F \\). Suppose f is not separable. Then in characteristic p, f(X) = g(X^{p^m}) where g is separable. Let β = α^{p^m}, so g(β) = 0. Then g is irreducible and separable over \\( K^p_F \\), so β is separable over \\( K^p_F \\). But since \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F, the extension \\( K^p_F \\)(β)/F must be both separable and purely inseparable. Because \\( K^p_F \\)/F is purely inseparable, and \\( K^p_F \\)(β)/ \\( K^p_F \\) is separable. But the composition of a purely inseparable and separable extension can only be trivial. Therefore, \\( K^p_F \\)(β) = \\( K^p_F \\), so β is in \\( K^p_F \\). Therefore, β ∈ \\( K^p_F \\), so α^{p^m} ∈ \\( K^p_F \\). Since \\( K^p_F \\) is purely inseparable over F, there exists some k such that (α^{p^m})^{p^k} = α^{p^{m + k}} ∈ F. Therefore, α ∈ \\( K^p_F \\), since \\( K^p_F \\) contains all elements in K with some p-power in F. Hence, α is in \\( K^p_F \\). But we assumed α is in L, an algebraic extension of \\( K^p_F \\). Therefore, L = \\( K^p_F \\), so the only algebraic extension is trivial, hence \\( K^p_F \\) is perfect. \n\nThis shows that every algebraic extension of \\( K^p_F \\) is trivial, hence \\( K^p_F \\) is perfect. Alternatively, since we showed any element in an algebraic extension must already be in \\( K^p_F \\), which implies that \\( K^p_F \\) has no nontrivial algebraic extensions, hence it's perfect. Wait, but actually, the user's edit says that a field is perfect iff every algebraic extension is separable. But we just showed that every algebraic extension is trivial, hence separable. So \\( K^p_F \\) is perfect. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: take an irreducible polynomial over \\( K^p_F \\). Suppose it's not separable. Then, as per the given property, in its splitting field, it factors as \\( f(X) = a_0(X - a_1)^{p^n} \\dots (X - a_r)^{p^n} \\). But since f is irreducible over \\( K^p_F \\), all roots a_i must be in \\( K^p_F \\). Wait, but if f factors into multiple distinct roots in the splitting field, but they are all in \\( K^p_F \\), then f would split into linear factors in \\( K^p_F \\), contradicting irreducibility unless r=1. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, if f is irreducible over \\( K^p_F \\), then it can't split into linear factors over \\( K^p_F \\). But according to the property, in the splitting field, it's a product of (X - a_i)^{p^n} with distinct a_i. But if these a_i are in the splitting field, not necessarily in \\( K^p_F \\). So if f is irreducible over \\( K^p_F \\), then in the splitting field, it must have only one distinct root, but with multiplicity p^n. Wait, but the property says that in characteristic p, an irreducible polynomial splits into distinct roots each raised to p^n. So if f is irreducible and inseparable, then in the splitting field, it's (X - a)^{p^n} for some a. Wait, but the property stated in the question says \"an irreducible polynomial over a field of characteristic p splits on its splitting field like this: f(X)= a_0(X-a_1)^{p^n} ... (X-a_r)^{p^n} where the a_i are distinct.\" So if f is irreducible, then r=1? Because otherwise, if r>1, then f would split into multiple factors, contradicting irreducibility. Wait, no. The splitting happens over the splitting field. So when you extend to the splitting field, it factors into linear terms each raised to p^n. But if f is irreducible over K^p_F, then in the splitting field, it's a product of (X - a_i)^{p^n}, but with all a_i conjugate. But since the field is of characteristic p, and K^p_F is purely inseparable over F, maybe the roots a_i are actually in K^p_F. Wait, but if K^p_F is perfect, then any irreducible polynomial over it would be separable, hence splits into distinct linear factors. But we need to show that. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the property that a field is perfect iff every algebraic extension is separable. We need to show that every algebraic extension of K^p_F is separable. Suppose L is an algebraic extension of K^p_F. Take any element α in L. Let f be the minimal polynomial of α over K^p_F. Suppose f is not separable. Then in characteristic p, f(X) = g(X^{p^m}) where g is separable. Then α^{p^m} is a root of g, which is separable over K^p_F. So α^{p^m} is separable over K^p_F. But K^p_F is purely inseparable over F. So the extension K^p_F(α^{p^m})/F is both separable (since α^{p^m} is separable over K^p_F, and K^p_F is purely inseparable over F) and purely inseparable (as it's contained in K^p_F(α^{p^m}) which is an extension of K^p_F). But if a field extension is both separable and purely inseparable, it must be trivial. Therefore, K^p_F(α^{p^m}) = F, which is impossible unless α^{p^m} is already in F. But α^{p^m} is in K^p_F, and since K^p_F is purely inseparable over F, there exists some n such that (α^{p^m})^{p^n} = α^{p^{m+n}} is in F. Therefore, α^{p^{m+n}} is in F, implying that α is in K^p_F (since K^p_F consists of elements with some p-power in F). Thus, α is in K^p_F. But this contradicts that α is in L, an extension of K^p_F, unless L = K^p_F. Therefore, any algebraic extension L of K^p_F must equal K^p_F itself, hence every algebraic extension is trivial (hence separable). Therefore, K^p_F is perfect. \n\nThis seems to be the correct reasoning. So the key idea is that any element in an algebraic extension of K^p_F would lead to a contradiction unless it's already in K^p_F, hence showing that all algebraic extensions are trivial, hence separable, and therefore K^p_F is perfect.",
