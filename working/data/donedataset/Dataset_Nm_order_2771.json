    "Content": "Let $f: \\mathbb{C} \\to  \\mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function such that $f^2$ and $f^3$ are both analytic. Prove that $f$ is also analytic. Some ideas: At $z_0$ where $f^2$ is not $0$ , then $f^3$ and $f^2$ are analytic so $f = \\frac{f^3}{f^2}$ is analytic at $z_0$ but at $z_0$ where $f^2$ is $0$, I'm not able to show that $f$ is analytic.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First rule out the case $f^2(z)\\equiv 0$ or $f^3(z)\\equiv 0$ as both imply $f(z)\\equiv 0$ and we are done. Write $f^2(z)=(z-z_0)^ng(z)$, $f^3(z)=(z-z_0)^mh(z)$ with $n.m\\in\\mathbb N_0$,  $g,h$ analytic and nonzero at $z_0$. Then \n$$(z-z_0)^{3n}g^3(z)=f^ 6(z)=(z-z_0) ^ {2m} h^2 (z)$$\nimplies $3n=2m$ (and $g^3=h^2$), hence if we let $k=m-n\\in\\mathbb Z$ we have $n=3n-2n=2m-2n=2k$ and $m=3m-2m=3m-3n=3k$. Especially, we see that $k\\ge 0$ and hence \n$$ f(z)=\\frac{f^3(z)}{f^2(z)}=(z-z_0)^k\\frac{g(z)}{h(z)}$$\nis analytic at $z_0$. Remark: We did not need that $f$ itself is continuous.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read and understand the original problem carefully. \n\nThe original question is about proving that a continuous function \\( f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\), for which \\( f^2 \\) and \\( f^3 \\) are analytic, must itself be analytic. The user has already considered cases where \\( f^2 \\) is non-zero and zero. My task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement following the given example.\n\nFirst, let's identify the assumptions. The function \\( f \\) is from the complex plane to itself, it's continuous, and both \\( f^2 \\) and \\( f^3 \\) are analytic. These are separate conditions applied to \\( f \\). So each of these should be a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nThe problem is to prove that under these conditions, \\( f \\) is analytic. Now, looking at the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, the assumptions are:\n\n1. \\( f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\) is a function.\n2. \\( f \\) is continuous.\n3. \\( f^2 \\) is analytic.\n4. \\( f^3 \\) is analytic.\n\nEach of these is a single condition applied to \\( f \\). The problem statement then is to prove \\( f \\) is analytic. \n\nWait, but the original problem says \"if \\( f^2 \\) and \\( f^3 \\) are analytic\", so maybe combine points 3 and 4? No, the example had separate lines for each, like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each condition is separate. So even though they are both about analyticity of powers of \\( f \\), they are separate assumptions. So list them as separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have four assumptions: function from C to C, continuity, analyticity of \\( f^2 \\), analyticity of \\( f^3 \\). Then the problem is to prove \\( f \\) is analytic.\n\nI should check if there's any other implicit assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention any other conditions, like specific points or regions, except for discussing zeros. But the main assumptions are those four. The problem is as stated: prove \\( f \\) is analytic.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\) is a function,\n\\( f \\) is continuous,\n\\( f^2 \\) is analytic,\n\\( f^3 \\) is analytic.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( f \\) is analytic.\n\nWait, the original problem's title mentions \"if \\( f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\) is a continuous function with \\( f^2, f^3 \\) analytic, then \\( f \\) is also analytic\". The user's example for the previous problem had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the example had only \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would make the problem only for n divisible by 7, which changes the problem. But the user's example might be incorrect, but perhaps that's intentional? Or maybe the user intended to filter out some conditions. Hmm, confusing.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question is to prove that f is analytic given that it's continuous and f² and f³ are analytic. There are no additional hidden assumptions. So the assumptions should be as listed: f is a function from C to C, continuous, f² analytic, f³ analytic. The problem is to prove f is analytic.\n\nTherefore, I need to structure it accordingly. Each assumption on a separate line. So the final answer should follow the format.",
