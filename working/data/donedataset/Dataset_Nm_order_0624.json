    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the integral of e^{-x²} cos(ax) from 0 to infinity equals (sqrt(π)/2) e^{-a²/4}. They mentioned trying to differentiate the right-hand side (RHS) and getting a differential equation involving f'(a) and a f(a), but they couldn't complete it. \n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the required format. Let's parse the original question. The main problem is to prove the given integral equality. The assumptions here are not explicitly stated, but typically for such integrals, there are conditions on the variables and functions involved. Let's list them.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞).\n2. The integrand is e^{-x²} multiplied by cos(ax).\n3. a is a real number (since it's inside a cosine function and the result involves a²).\n4. The function e^{-x²} is integrable over [0, ∞), which it is because it decays rapidly.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove the equality. Now, the user tried differentiating the RHS, which suggests they considered f(a) as the integral and tried to take its derivative with respect to a. Let me recall that differentiating under the integral sign might be useful here. \n\nLet me think through the steps. Let f(a) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx. Then f'(a) would be the integral of the derivative of the integrand with respect to a, which is -∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx. Integrating this by parts, let u = sin(ax), dv = -x e^{-x²} dx. Then du = a cos(ax) dx, and v = (1/2) e^{-x²}. The boundary terms vanish because e^{-x²} goes to zero at infinity and sin(0) is zero. So f'(a) = - [ (1/2) e^{-x²} sin(ax) ]₀^∞ + (a/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx. The first term is zero, so f'(a) = (a/2) f(a). Wait, but the user mentioned -2 f'(a) = a f(a). If f'(a) = - (a/2) f(a), then that would give the differential equation. Wait, maybe I made a sign error. Let's check again.\n\nDifferentiating f(a): f'(a) = d/da ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} (-x sin(ax)) dx. So f'(a) = -∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx. Now, integrate by parts: let u = sin(ax), dv = -x e^{-x²} dx. Then du = a cos(ax) da, and v = (1/2) e^{-x²} as before. So integration by parts gives uv|₀^∞ - ∫₀^∞ v du. The uv term is (1/2) e^{-x²} sin(ax) evaluated from 0 to ∞, which is zero. Then the integral becomes -∫₀^∞ (1/2) e^{-x²} a cos(ax) dx. So overall, f'(a) = - [ (1/2) e^{-x²} sin(ax) |₀^∞ - (a/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx ] = - [0 - (a/2) f(a) ] = (a/2) f(a). Wait, so this gives f'(a) = (a/2) f(a). But the user mentioned getting -2 f'(a) = a f(a). That would imply f'(a) = -a/2 f(a), which contradicts my result. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considered differentiating with respect to a different variable or made a sign mistake. Let's see: If f(a) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx, then f'(a) = -∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx. Let's try another approach. Let me consider integrating f'(a) = -∫ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx. Let me perform substitution. Let’s set t = x², but maybe not. Alternatively, recognize that the integral might relate to the derivative of the Gaussian integral. Alternatively, note that the differential equation here is f'(a) = - (a/2) f(a). Wait, but in my calculation, I obtained f'(a) = (a/2) f(a). Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, f'(a) = -∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx. Integration by parts: u = sin(ax), dv = -x e^{-x²} dx. Then du = a cos(ax) dx, dv = -x e^{-x²} dx → v = (1/2) e^{-x²}. Then integration by parts formula is uv|₀^∞ - ∫₀^∞ v du. So:\n\nuv at ∞ is (1/2) e^{-x²} sin(ax) → 0 as x→infty. At 0, sin(0) is 0. So the first term is 0. Then the integral becomes - ∫₀^∞ (1/2) e^{-x²} * a cos(ax) dx = - (a/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx = - (a/2) f(a). Therefore, f'(a) = - [ - (a/2) f(a) ] = (a/2) f(a)? Wait, no. Wait, the integration by parts gives f'(a) = - [ uv|₀^∞ - ∫ v du ] = - [ 0 - ∫ v du ] = - [ - (a/2) ∫ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx ] = (a/2) f(a). So f'(a) = (a/2) f(a). But then the differential equation would be f'(a) = (a/2) f(a), which has the solution f(a) = C e^{a²/4}. But wait, the answer is supposed to be e^{-a²/4}. There's a discrepancy here. That suggests that maybe I messed up the sign.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign during differentiation. Let me double-check. The derivative of cos(ax) with respect to a is -x sin(ax). So f'(a) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} (-x sin(ax)) dx = - ∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx. Correct. Then integrating by parts, set u = sin(ax), dv = -x e^{-x²} dx. Then dv = -x e^{-x²} dx, so v = (1/2) e^{-x²} (since the integral of x e^{-x²} dx is - (1/2) e^{-x²} + C). So uv|₀^∞ = 0, and - ∫ v du becomes - ∫₀^∞ (1/2) e^{-x²} * a cos(ax) dx = - (a/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx = - (a/2) f(a). Therefore, putting it all together, f'(a) = - [ - (a/2) f(a) ] = (a/2) f(a). So the differential equation is f'(a) = (a/2) f(a). But this leads to f(a) increasing exponentially, which contradicts the expected result of e^{-a²/4}. So clearly, there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe I flipped a sign somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have chosen different parts in the integration by parts. Let's try integrating by parts with u = x e^{-x²}, dv = sin(ax) dx. Then du = (e^{-x²} - 2x² e^{-x²}) dx, and v = - (1/a) cos(ax). Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps consider a different approach. Let me recall that the standard integral ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx = sqrt(π) e^{-a²/4}. Since the integrand is even, ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx = (1/2) sqrt(π) e^{-a²/4}, which matches the RHS of the problem. But how to prove this?\n\nAnother method: Use differentiation under the integral sign. Let f(a) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx. Then f'(a) = -∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx. Now, integrate f'(a) by parts, setting u = sin(ax), dv = -x e^{-x²} dx. Then du = a cos(ax) dx, and dv = -x e^{-x²} dx → v = (1/2) e^{-x²}. Then, as before, uv|₀^∞ is zero, and the integral becomes - (a/2) ∫ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx = - (a/2) f(a). Therefore, f'(a) = - (a/2) f(a). Wait, now this contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, what's happening here.\n\nWait, let's re-express: f'(a) = - ∫ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx. Integration by parts: u = sin(ax) → du = a cos(ax) da, dv = -x e^{-x²} dx → v = (1/2) e^{-x²}. Then, ∫ u dv = uv|₀^∞ - ∫ v du. So:\n\nuv|₀^∞ = [ (1/2) e^{-x²} sin(ax) ] from 0 to ∞ = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nThen, - ∫ v du = - ∫ (1/2) e^{-x²} * a cos(ax) dx = - (a/2) ∫ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx = - (a/2) f(a).\n\nTherefore, f'(a) = - [ uv|₀^∞ - ∫ v du ] = - [ 0 - ∫ v du ] = - [ - (a/2) f(a) ] = (a/2) f(a). Wait, no, because f'(a) = ∫ u dv = uv|₀^∞ - ∫ v du. But f'(a) was already expressed as - ∫ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx, which is equal to - [ uv|₀^∞ - ∫ v du ] = - [ 0 - ∫ v du ] = ∫ v du = ∫ (1/2) e^{-x²} a cos(ax) dx = (a/2) f(a). So f'(a) = (a/2) f(a). But that leads to f(a) = C e^{a²/4}, which is not the desired result. There's a contradiction here, indicating an error in the process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial differentiation is incorrect. Wait, wait. Let's check with a=0. When a=0, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = (sqrt(π))/2, which matches the RHS when a=0: (sqrt(π)/2) e^{0} = sqrt(π)/2. So if f(0) = sqrt(π)/2. If the differential equation is f'(a) = (a/2) f(a), then the solution is f(a) = f(0) e^{a²/4}, which would give sqrt(π)/2 e^{a²/4}, but the correct answer is sqrt(π)/2 e^{-a²/4}. So clearly, there's a mistake in the sign.\n\nAh! I think I see the error. When differentiating f(a) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx with respect to a, the derivative is f'(a) = -∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx. Now, integrating this by parts: let u = -x e^{-x²}, dv = sin(ax) dx. Wait, maybe I should set u = sin(ax), dv = -x e^{-x²} dx. Wait, let's try that again. \n\nLet me set u = sin(ax), dv = -x e^{-x²} dx. Then du = a cos(ax) dx, and v = (1/2) e^{-x²}. Then ∫ u dv = uv|₀^∞ - ∫ v du = [ (1/2) e^{-x²} sin(ax) ] from 0 to ∞ - ∫ (1/2) e^{-x²} a cos(ax) dx. The first term is zero, so ∫ u dv = - (a/2) ∫ e^{-x²} cos(ax) dx = - (a/2) f(a). Therefore, the integral ∫ u dv = - (a/2) f(a). But remember that f'(a) = ∫ u dv = - (a/2) f(a). Wait, no. Because f'(a) = - ∫ x e^{-x²} sin(ax) dx = ∫ u dv where u = sin(ax), dv = -x e^{-x²} dx. But ∫ u dv = uv| - ∫ v du. So ∫ u dv = [ (1/2) e^{-x²} sin(ax) ] from 0 to ∞ - ∫ (1/2) e^{-x²} a cos(ax) dx = 0 - (a/2) f(a). Therefore, f'(a) = ∫ u dv = - (a/2) f(a). So f'(a) = - (a/2) f(a). That gives the differential equation f'(a) + (a/2) f(a) = 0. \n\nYes! So I must have made a sign error earlier. So the correct differential equation is f'(a) = - (a/2) f(a). Then, solving this, we get d/d a [ln f(a)] = -a/2 → ln f(a) = - a²/4 + C → f(a) = C e^{-a²/4}. Using f(0) = sqrt(π)/2, we find C = sqrt(π)/2. Hence, f(a) = (sqrt(π)/2) e^{-a²/4}, which matches the desired result. \n\nSo the user's approach was correct, but they might have had a sign error or missed a step in the integration by parts. Therefore, structuring the problem correctly involves identifying the assumptions and presenting the problem clearly.",
