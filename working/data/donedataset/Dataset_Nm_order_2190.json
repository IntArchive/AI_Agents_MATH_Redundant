    "Content": "I'm reading Bernt Oksendal's \"Stochastic Differential Equations\" and this is one of the exercise: 2.2 a) (iii). Let $X:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a randome variable. The distribution function $F$ of $X$ is defined by\n$$F(x) = P[X\\leq x]$$\na) prove that $F$ has the following properties:\n(iii) $F$ is right-continuous, i.e. $F(x) = \\lim_{\\substack{h\\rightarrow 0\\\\h>0}}F(x+h)$. I'm wondering, if $X$ is defined as:\n$$X = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}X_n,$$\nwhere for $X_n$ $$\\text{F}_{X_n}(x) = \\left\\{ \n  \\begin{array}{l l}\n    0 & \\quad \\text{if } x \\leq 0 \\\\\n    n\\cdot x & \\quad \\text{if }  0<x<1/n\\\\\n    1 & \\quad \\text{if } 1/n \\leq x\n  \\end{array} \\right.$$\nthen wouldn't that $$F(0) = 0,$$ and $\\forall \\epsilon > 0$, $\\exists n_\\epsilon$, s.t. $\\forall n>n_\\epsilon$, $$F_{X_n}(\\epsilon) =1 \\text{ ?}$$ added after reading @MichaelHardy 's comment. I think the question was not put clearly, due to my superficial understanding of probability theory. Now let me try again. My real doubt is: The assertion \" distribution function $F$ is right-continuous\" from \"Stochastic Differential Equations\" exercise 2.2 a) (iii) actually means: it's not possible to define a random variable $ X:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, such that its distribution function fulfills: $$F_X(x) = \\left\\{ \n  \\begin{array}{l l}\n    0 & \\quad \\text{if } x \\leq 0 \\\\\n    1 & \\quad \\text{if } x > 0\n  \\end{array} \\right.$$ I'd like to ask: why?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about why the distribution function F is right-continuous. They mention an example where X is defined as the limit of X_n, each X_n having a specific distribution function F_{X_n}(x). The user seems confused because if they take the limit, F(0) would be 0, but for any ε > 0, F_{X_n}(ε) becomes 1 as n grows. They then rephrase their doubt, suggesting that the real question is whether it's impossible to define a random variable X with a distribution function that jumps from 0 to 1 at x=0, which would not be right-continuous there.\n\nSo, the core problem here is to show that such a distribution function (which is not right-continuous) can't exist for any random variable. The assumptions need to be extracted. The key points from the question:\n\n1. The user is working with a random variable X: Ω → ℝ.\n2. The distribution function F is defined as F(x) = P[X ≤ x].\n3. The problem is part (iii) of exercise 2.2 a) in Oksendal's book, which asks to prove F is right-continuous.\n4. The user provides an example where they define X as the limit of X_n, each X_n having a piecewise distribution function.\n5. The user's confusion arises from considering F_X(x) that jumps from 0 to 1 at x=0, which is not right-continuous there.\n\nBut in their rephrased doubt, they are asking why such a distribution function (which is not right-continuous) can't exist. The example they give is F_X(x) being 0 for x ≤0 and 1 for x>0. This function is left-continuous at 0, not right-continuous. So the problem is to explain why such a distribution function (with a jump from 0 to 1 at 0, making it left-continuous there) can't be valid for any random variable X. The underlying assumption here is that F_X(x) is supposed to be a valid distribution function, which by definition must be right-continuous. But the user is challenging that assumption, perhaps because their constructed example seems to lead to a contradiction.\n\nHowever, the actual task is to structure the problem as per the given format. The original problem is to prove that F is right-continuous. The user's example is a specific case where they think the limit might lead to a non-right-continuous F, but the real issue is why such an F (as in the step function at 0) can't exist. So the problem the user wants answered is why it's impossible to have a random variable X with that specific F_X(x) which is not right-continuous. Therefore, the assumptions would include that F is the distribution function of a random variable X, and the problem is to show that such F must be right-continuous, hence the example the user gives is invalid because such an F can't exist.\n\nBut according to the example format, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So in the original problem, the assumptions would be that F is a distribution function defined by F(x) = P[X ≤ x], where X is a random variable. The problem is to prove F is right-continuous. However, the user's specific example leads them to question this, so maybe the problem they want structured is: given a random variable X, its distribution function F(x) = P[X ≤ x] must be right-continuous; why can't there exist an X with F_X(x) as defined (0 for x ≤0, 1 for x>0)?\n\nSo the formatted problem should list assumptions related to F being a distribution function (i.e., defined as the probability that X is ≤x) and the problem is to show that such a function must be right-continuous, hence the specific example F_X(x) given by the user is impossible. The user's example might be trying to construct such a case, but the convergence in distribution might not hold as expected. But in the problem structure, we need to filter out the extraneous parts of their question and focus on the core problem: proving F is right-continuous, given that F(x) = P[X ≤x] for a random variable X.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is asking specifically why their example is invalid, the assumptions would include X being defined as the limit of X_n with those specific distribution functions, but perhaps that convergence doesn't preserve the right-continuity? Wait, but the user's example might not actually converge to the discontinuous F_X they propose. The key is that even if each X_n has a right-continuous F_{X_n}, the limit might not, but according to the properties of distribution functions, the limit (in some sense) should also be right-continuous. So the user's confusion is why their constructed example doesn't result in a valid F_X that's not right-continuous. Therefore, the problem they're posing is: why can't there exist a random variable X with distribution function F_X(x) that is 0 for x ≤0 and 1 for x>0, which is not right-continuous at 0?\n\nHence, the formatted problem should list the assumption that F is a distribution function defined by F(x) = P[X ≤x], and the problem is to show that such F must be right-continuous, hence F_X(x) as defined (with a jump at 0 from 0 to 1) is impossible. The user's example with X_n might converge in distribution to a random variable that is 0 almost surely, but that's different from their proposed F_X. Alternatively, maybe the limit isn't a valid distribution function. But the core problem is the assertion that F must be right-continuous.",
