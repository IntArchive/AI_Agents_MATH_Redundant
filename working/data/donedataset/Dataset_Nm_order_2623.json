    "Content": "Let $Q_8$ be the quaternion group. Show that $G/Z$ can never be isomorphic to $Q_8$ , where $Z$ is the center of $G$ . Hint: if $G/Z\\cong Q_8$ , show that $G$ has two abelian subgroups of index $2$ . I'm trying to prove the hint by looking at the canonical homomorphism $\\pi:G\\rightarrow G/Z$ . Well, $Q_8$ has some abelian subgroups of index $2$ , such as $H=\\{1,-1,i,-i\\}$ , but that doesn't seem to map to abelian subgroups of index $2$ of $G$ . (We know that $\\pi(ab)=\\pi(a)\\pi(b)=\\pi(b)\\pi(a)=\\pi(ba)$ for $a,b$ in $\\pi^{-1}(H)$ , but that only yields $aba^{-1}b^{-1}\\in Z$ , not $aba^{-1}b^{-1}=1$ .)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$Q_8$ has cyclic subgroups of index $2$, such as $\\langle i\\rangle$ and $\\langle j\\rangle$.\nTheir inverse images in $G$ are of index $2$ and their respective centres contains at least the centre $Z$ of $G$. Hence their quotient by their centre is cyclic and finally $\\pi^{-1}(\\langle i\\rangle)$ and $\\pi^{-1}(\\langle j\\rangle)$ are abelian (cf. Jykri Lahtonen's comment).\nSelect $g\\in G$ with $\\pi(g)=-1$. Then $g\\in \\pi^{-1}(\\langle i\\rangle)\\cap \\pi^{-1}(\\langle j\\rangle)$, hence it commutes with all elements of $\\pi^{-1}(\\langle i\\rangle)$ and all elements of $\\pi^{-1}(\\langle j\\rangle)$, therefore also with all elements of $\\pi^{-1}(\\langle i,j\\rangle)=\\pi^{-1}(Q_8)=G$, contradicting $g\\notin Z$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"$G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to quaternion group\". The user wants to show that if $Z$ is the center of $G$, then $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$. The hint provided suggests that if such an isomorphism existed, $G$ would have two abelian subgroups of index 2, and the user is trying to work through that hint.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about group theory. The key elements here are:\n\n1. $G$ is a group.\n2. $Z$ is the center of $G$ (so $Z = Z(G)$).\n3. The quotient group $G/Z$ is being considered.\n4. The claim is that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$ (the quaternion group).\n\nThe original problem doesn't state any additional conditions on $G$, so the main assumptions are that $Z$ is the center and $G/Z \\cong Q_8$ leads to a contradiction. However, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list the conditions given. The problem is to show that such an isomorphism is impossible. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"Show that $G/Z$ can never be isomorphic to $Q_8$\", so the assumptions would be the general conditions under which this is being claimed. Since the problem is general for any group $G$ with center $Z$, the assumptions are:\n\n- $G$ is a group.\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$.\n\nBut the user might be assuming that $G$ is a group where such a quotient could exist, and then showing it's impossible. However, in the example provided, assumptions are specific conditions given in the problem. For instance, in the example, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But here, the problem is more abstract. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed the assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the user included that in the formatted problem's assumptions. Wait, no—looking back, the example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem under Assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that perhaps the example was modified to include additional assumptions, maybe from the solution approach. But that's confusing. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, perhaps the example was a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, but in the example given by the user, they structured it with n being an integer and n divisible by 7 as assumptions. So perhaps the task here is to extract the explicit assumptions from the problem as stated, not from the solution or hints.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is \"Show that $G/Z$ can never be isomorphic to $Q_8$\". So the assumptions would be:\n\n- $G$ is a group.\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$.\n- $G/Z$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$ (but this leads to a contradiction, so the actual assumption for the problem is the first two, and the conclusion is that $G/Z$ cannot be $Q_8$).\n\nWait, but the way the example was structured, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. That suggests that maybe the user included the general condition (n is integer) and then an additional condition (n divisible by 7). But in the original problem, it's for every integer n, so perhaps the example was incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem had a different original statement. Given the confusion, perhaps the key is to list all the explicit assumptions given in the problem. In the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- $G$ is a group.\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$.\n\nBut the problem is to show that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$. So the problem is under the assumptions that $G$ is any group with center $Z$, then $G/Z$ is not isomorphic to $Q_8$. However, the user's example included specific conditions applied to one object (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So perhaps in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$,\n- $G/Z$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$, so maybe the assumption that leads to contradiction is $G/Z \\cong Q_8$, but the actual problem is to prove that under the general conditions (G is a group, Z is its center), $G/Z$ cannot be Q8. Therefore, the assumptions should be the general conditions, not the contradictory one. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem's conclusion was that for every integer n, it's divisible by 91. However, 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the example's formatted problem was incorrect. Maybe the user intended to structure a problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was more general. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the example. Regardless, for the current problem, the task is to structure the problem as per the example's format.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. That seems inconsistent unless the original problem had a typo. But perhaps the user intended to have a problem where n is divisible by 7, hence the assumption. Alternatively, maybe the example is wrong, but we have to follow it.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the user wants to show that $G/Z$ can never be isomorphic to $Q_8$. The original problem states that, so the assumptions are:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$.\n\nThe problem is to show that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nBut wait, in the example, assumptions included both the general condition (n is an integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). But in the original problem here, there are no specific conditions except that $Z$ is the center. So perhaps the assumptions are just:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that $G/Z$ is not isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented as a contradiction: assume that $G/Z \\cong Q_8$, then derive a contradiction. In that case, the assumption would be $G/Z$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$, and the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction (hence proving that it cannot happen). But in the example, the assumptions were the conditions given, not the contradictory assumption.\n\nWait, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. This seems like an error because the original problem didn't specify that n is divisible by 7. But perhaps the example was from a different problem. Given that, maybe in the current task, the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. Since the problem is \"Show that $G/Z$ can never be isomorphic to $Q_8$\", the given conditions are that $G$ is a group and $Z$ is its center. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under these conditions, $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$. However, in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove that $G/Z$ is not isomorphic to $Q_8$, given that $G$ is a group and $Z$ is its center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to list all conditions that are premises of the problem. Since the problem is \"Show that $G/Z$ can never be isomorphic to $Q_8$\", the only premises are that $G$ is a group and $Z$ is its center. So the assumptions are:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nBut looking at the user's own attempt, they mention the hint: \"if $G/Z \\cong Q_8$, show that $G$ has two abelian subgroups of index 2.\" So the problem is under the assumption that $G/Z \\cong Q_8$, derive a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions should include that $G/Z$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$ as a hypothetical scenario. But the original problem is to show that this can never happen. So the actual problem is a universal statement: For all groups G, if Z is the center of G, then G/Z is not isomorphic to Q8. Therefore, the assumptions are the general ones (G is a group, Z is its center), and the problem is to show that G/Z cannot be Q8.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) leading to the problem to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the equivalent would be the general conditions (G group, Z center) leading to the problem of proving non-isomorphism to Q8.\n\nTherefore, following the example's structure, the assumptions should be:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$.\n\nAnd the problem is: Prove that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is presented as \"Assume that $G/Z \\cong Q_8$, then derive a contradiction\", the assumptions would include $G/Z \\cong Q_8$. But the original problem is to show that this can never happen, so the problem is under the general assumptions of G and Z, show that G/Z is not Q8. Hence, the assumptions are just G is a group, Z is its center.\n\nBut the example given by the user seems to have included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". This suggests that maybe in the example, the user made a mistake, or perhaps the original problem had a different statement. Given that, perhaps the current problem should list the assumptions as:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$,\n- $G/Z$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nBut that would be the assumption leading to contradiction, and the problem would be to show a contradiction (hence proving that the assumption is false). However, the problem is phrased as \"Show that $G/Z$ can never be isomorphic to $Q_8$\", which is a universal statement. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should be the general conditions, and the problem is to prove the impossibility.\n\nBut I need to reconcile this with the example. In the example, the original problem was to prove for all n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless there was a miscommunication. But perhaps the example is correct in its own context. For instance, maybe the original problem had a different wording, such as \"Prove that if n is an integer divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91\", but the user wrote it as \"for every integer n\". That would be a discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to present a different problem. Given that uncertainty, I have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's own attempt mentions trying to prove the hint: if $G/Z \\cong Q_8$, then $G$ has two abelian subgroups of index 2. So the problem is structured as: assuming $G/Z \\cong Q_8$, derive a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the assumption here is that $G/Z$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$, and the problem is to show that this leads to $G$ having two abelian subgroups of index 2, which may lead to a contradiction. However, the main problem is to show that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$ in the first place.\n\nGiven the instructions to structure the problem as in the example, and considering the example possibly included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", perhaps here the assumptions should include both the general conditions and the hypothetical scenario leading to the contradiction. But I need to follow the example's format.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", problem: prove A(n) is divisible by 91. That seems like the user might have intended a different problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was more general. If I follow that pattern, here the assumptions would be:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$,\n- $G/Z$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nBut the problem would then be to derive a contradiction (i.e., show that this cannot happen). However, the example's problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as: under the assumption that $G/Z \\cong Q_8$, show that $G$ has two abelian subgroups of index 2 (the hint), leading to the contradiction. But the actual problem is to show that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format. You will be given some example which I structured before.\" So following the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But this seems inconsistent unless the original problem had a typo. Maybe in the example, the actual problem was to prove that if n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem would correctly list the assumptions. But given that the user wrote \"for every integer n\", perhaps they made a mistake. Given that, I have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is \"Show that $G/Z$ can never be isomorphic to $Q_8$\". The only assumptions are that G is a group and Z is its center. So the formatted problem should list those as assumptions, and the problem is to show that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$. However, looking back at the user's example, maybe the assumptions are the conditions required for the problem to hold. In the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which requires n being an integer (the domain) and perhaps another condition (like divisibility by 7). Here, the problem's domain is any group G with center Z, and the conclusion is that $G/Z$ is not Q8. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that $G/Z$ cannot be isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nBut the user's example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem statement, which was \"for every integer n\". That suggests that perhaps the example was incorrect, but we have to follow the user's formatting regardless. Given that, maybe in this case, the assumptions should be:\n\n- $G$ is a group,\n- $Z$ is the center of $G$,\n- $G/Z$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$.\n\nBut then the problem would be to derive a contradiction. However, the original problem is to show that $G/Z$ can never be isomorphic to $Q_8$, which is a general statement. Therefore, the correct assumptions are just the general ones (G is a group, Z its center), and the problem is to show that under these conditions, $G/Z$ cannot be Q8. But the example suggests that assumptions can include specific conditions even if the original problem was stated generally. This is confusing, but perhaps the user intended to have the assumptions as the conditions that lead to the problem's conclusion. If the problem is to show that $G/Z$ is not Q8, then the assumptions are G is a group and Z is its center. Hence, I'll proceed with that.",
