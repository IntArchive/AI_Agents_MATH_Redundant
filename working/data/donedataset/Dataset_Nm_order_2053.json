    "Content": "Let $S=\\mathbb{Z}-\\{0\\}$. Show the existence or nonexistence of isomorphism between $S^{-1}\\prod_{1}^{\\infty}\\mathbb{Z}_{i}$ and $\\prod_{1}^{\\infty}\\mathbb{Q}_{i}$ as $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces. (Here $\\mathbb Z_i=\\mathbb Z$ and $\\mathbb Q_i=\\mathbb Q$ for all $i\\ge 1$.) This is an example used to show that the localization does not commute with infinite products under the natural (canonical) homomorphism . I read this from a lecture note by Ravi Vakil. I think we still need to show these two are really not isomorphic as $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces. I tried to follow the hint to consider the element $(1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3},...,\\frac{1}{n},...)$ but failed. To user26857: I want a proof of the existence or nonexistence of isomorphism between these two vector spaces. If I get it right, your solution reduced the problem to the existence of basis of these two vector spaces. And in your sense, a basis  is a subset $B$ (of the vector space $V$) such that every finite subset of $B$ is a linearly independent set and any vector in $V$ can be expressed as a finite sum of the elements in $B$. If this is what you mean, can you show the existence of such basis? Thank you! To Ragib Zaman: Your example is a better one. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "They are isomorphic as $\\mathbb Q$-vector spaces, but not canonically. Let $B\\subset\\mathbb Q^{\\mathbb N}$ a $\\mathbb Q$-basis. Then $|\\mathbb Q^{\\mathbb N}|=|B||\\mathbb Q|$. On the other side, we have $\\mathbb Z^{\\mathbb N}\\subset S^{-1}\\mathbb Z^{\\mathbb N}\\subset\\mathbb Q^{\\mathbb N}$, so $|\\mathbb Z^{\\mathbb N}|\\le |S^{-1}\\mathbb Z^{\\mathbb N}|\\le|\\mathbb Q^{\\mathbb N}|$. Since $|\\mathbb Z^{\\mathbb N}|=|\\mathbb Q^{\\mathbb N}|$ we get $|S^{-1}\\mathbb Z^{\\mathbb N}|=|\\mathbb Q^{\\mathbb N}|$. If $B'\\subset S^{-1}\\mathbb Z^{\\mathbb N}$ is a $\\mathbb Q$-basis we have $|S^{-1}\\mathbb Z^{\\mathbb N}|=|B'||\\mathbb Q|$, and therefore $|B|=|B'|$, so $\\mathbb Q^{\\mathbb N}$ is isomorphic to $S^{-1}\\mathbb Z^{\\mathbb N}$ as $\\mathbb Q$-vector spaces. The canonical morphism sends $(k_n)_{n\\ge 1}/s$ to $(k_n/s)_{n\\ge 1}$. If there is such an element which is sent to $(1/n)_{n\\ge 1}$, then $k_n/s=1/n$ for all $n\\ge 1$, that is, $nk_n=s$ for all $n\\ge 1$ (or, if you like, $n\\mid s$ for all $n\\ge 1$), a contradiction. Thus the canonical morphism is (injective but) not surjective.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully to identify the key assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe title mentions that localization doesn't commute canonically with infinite direct products. The user is asking about showing the existence or nonexistence of an isomorphism between two specific objects as ℚ-vector spaces: S⁻¹(∏₁^∞ ℤ_i) and ∏₁^∞ ℚ_i, where S is ℤ - {0}. They also mention that this is an example from Ravi Vakil's notes to show that localization doesn't commute with infinite products under the natural homomorphism. There's some discussion in the question about using a specific element (1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n, ...) and about the basis of these vector spaces according to a certain definition.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about showing whether these two structures are isomorphic as ℚ-vector spaces. Let's parse the problem statement.\n\nAssumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The user defines S as ℤ - {0}, so S is the multiplicative set of non-zero integers.\n2. The localization S⁻¹ is applied to the infinite product ∏₁^∞ ℤ_i, where each ℤ_i is ℤ. So the first object is S⁻¹(∏ ℤ).\n3. The second object is the infinite product ∏₁^∞ ℚ_i, where each ℚ_i is ℚ.\n4. The problem is about isomorphism between these two as ℚ-vector spaces. So we need to consider their structures within the category of ℚ-vector spaces.\n5. The context mentions that this is to show localization doesn't commute with infinite products under the canonical homomorphism. However, the core problem here is the isomorphism existence.\n\nWait, the problem is whether S⁻¹(∏ ℤ_i) is isomorphic to ∏ ℚ_i as ℚ-vector spaces. The user wants to know existence or nonexistence. The original example is from Vakil, and the user is trying to follow a hint with a specific element.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- S = ℤ \\ {0}\n- For each i ≥ 1, ℤ_i = ℤ\n- For each i ≥ 1, ℚ_i = ℚ\n- The objects S⁻¹(∏_{i=1}^∞ ℤ_i) and ∏_{i=1}^∞ ℚ_i are considered as ℚ-vector spaces\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show whether there exists an isomorphism between these two vector spaces.\n\nBut wait, the user says \"show the existence or nonexistence of isomorphism\", so the problem is to determine which is the case. The answer is that they are not isomorphic, but in the problem statement, we just need to present the problem as per the format.\n\nSo formatting:\n\nAssumption:\nS is the multiplicative set ℤ \\ {0},\nFor all i ≥ 1, ℤ_i = ℤ,\nFor all i ≥ 1, ℚ_i = ℚ,\nS⁻¹(∏_{i=1}^∞ ℤ_i) is considered as a ℚ-vector space,\n∏_{i=1}^∞ ℚ_i is considered as a ℚ-vector space.\n\nProblem:\nShow the existence or nonexistence of an isomorphism between S⁻¹(∏_{i=1}^∞ ℤ_i) and ∏_{i=1}^∞ ℚ_i as ℚ-vector spaces.\n\nBut need to check if each assumption is one line per property. Let's list each assumption on a separate line:\n\n- S is the multiplicative set ℤ \\ {0}\n- For each integer i ≥ 1, ℤ_i is the ring ℤ\n- For each integer i ≥ 1, ℚ_i is the field ℚ\n- S⁻¹(∏_{i=1}^∞ ℤ_i) is a ℚ-vector space\n- ∏_{i=1}^∞ ℚ_i is a ℚ-vector space\n\nWait, but S⁻¹(∏ ℤ_i) would be a module over S⁻¹ℤ = ℚ, since S is ℤ \\ {0}, so localization at S turns ℤ into ℚ. Hence, S⁻¹(∏ ℤ_i) is a ℚ-vector space. Similarly, each ℚ_i is ℚ, so their product is also a ℚ-vector space. Therefore, those are part of the setup, so the assumptions include that these objects are ℚ-vector spaces.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have these assumptions. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumption was n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. Similarly here, each condition on a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nS is the multiplicative set ℤ \\ {0},\nFor each integer i ≥ 1, ℤ_i = ℤ,\nFor each integer i ≥ 1, ℚ_i = ℚ,\nS⁻¹(∏_{i=1}^∞ ℤ_i) is considered as a ℚ-vector space,\n∏_{i=1}^∞ ℚ_i is considered as a ℚ-vector space.\n\nProblem:\nShow the existence or nonexistence of an isomorphism between S⁻¹(∏_{i=1}^∞ ℤ_i) and ∏_{i=1}^∞ ℚ_i as ℚ-vector spaces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some assumptions can be combined, but according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. For example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So here, each bullet is a separate assumption.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is focusing on the two objects being ℚ-vector spaces. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- S = ℤ \\ {0}\n- Each ℤ_i = ℤ\n- Each ℚ_i = ℚ\n- S⁻¹(∏_{i=1}^∞ ℤ_i) is a ℚ-vector space\n- ∏_{i=1}^∞ ℚ_i is a ℚ-vector space\n\nBut maybe the last two are consequences rather than assumptions. Wait, since localization at S of ℤ is ℚ, so S⁻¹(∏ ℤ_i) is a module over ℚ, hence a ℚ-vector space. Similarly, the product of ℚ's is a ℚ-vector space. So perhaps those are not assumptions but inherent properties. But the user in their problem says \"as ℚ-vector spaces\", which is part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem statement by the user:\n\n\"Show the existence or nonexistence of isomorphism between $S^{-1}\\prod_{1}^{\\infty}\\mathbb{Z}_{i}$ and $\\prod_{1}^{\\infty}\\mathbb{Q}_{i}$ as $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces.\"\n\nSo the problem is to consider these two objects as ℚ-vector spaces and determine if they're isomorphic. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- S is ℤ \\ {0}\n- For all i, ℤ_i = ℤ\n- For all i, ℚ_i = ℚ\n- The two objects are considered as ℚ-vector spaces\n\nBut maybe the last point is part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, in the problem statement, the user says \"as ℚ-vector spaces\", so that is part of the problem's condition. Therefore, the assumptions would include that S⁻¹(∏ ℤ_i) and ∏ ℚ_i are ℚ-vector spaces. However, in reality, this is a consequence of their construction. For example, localizing ℤ at S gives ℚ, so S⁻¹(∏ ℤ_i) is a ℚ-module, hence a ℚ-vector space. Similarly, the product of ℚ's is a ℚ-vector space.\n\nBut in the problem, the user is to consider them as ℚ-vector spaces, so perhaps that's part of the problem's setup. Therefore, the assumptions should include that these are ℚ-vector spaces. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable n. In the original problem here, the objects are constructed in a way that they are ℚ-vector spaces, so maybe the assumptions are the first three points, and the problem includes the \"as ℚ-vector spaces\" part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nS is the multiplicative set ℤ \\ {0},\nFor each integer i ≥ 1, ℤ_i = ℤ,\nFor each integer i ≥ 1, ℚ_i = ℚ.\n\nProblem:\nShow the existence or nonexistence of an isomorphism between S⁻¹(∏_{i=1}^∞ ℤ_i) and ∏_{i=1}^∞ ℚ_i as ℚ-vector spaces.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the \"as ℚ-vector spaces\" is part of the problem's condition, so perhaps that is included in the problem line rather than the assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem line is the original statement. But in that case, the user had added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7), but in the original problem, the user may not have that. Wait, the example's original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a misrepresentation? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems contradictory. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, according to the instructions, the task is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions line by line.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to show isomorphism as ℚ-vector spaces. The key elements are S, the product of ℤ_i, localization at S, product of ℚ_i, and the ℚ-vector space structure. The assumptions should be the setup: S is defined as ℤ\\{0}, each ℤ_i is ℤ, each ℚ_i is ℚ, and the problem is about isomorphism as ℚ-vector spaces. But since the problem statement already includes \"as ℚ-vector spaces\", maybe that's part of the problem line, not the assumptions.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nS is the multiplicative set ℤ \\ {0},\nFor each integer i ≥ 1, ℤ_i = ℤ,\nFor each integer i ≥ 1, ℚ_i = ℚ.\n\nProblem:\nShow the existence or nonexistence of an isomorphism between S⁻¹(∏_{i=1}^∞ ℤ_i) and ∏_{i=1}^∞ ℚ_i as ℚ-vector spaces.\n\nThat seems correct. Each assumption is one line, each addressing one property. The problem line includes the specific task. The fact that they are ℚ-vector spaces is part of the problem's context, but in reality, it's a consequence of the localization and the product structure. However, since the problem explicitly states \"as ℚ-vector spaces\", perhaps it's better to include it in the problem line rather than the assumptions.\n\nSo I think this would be the correct formatting. Let me check again the original question to make sure I didn't miss any key assumptions. The user mentions that ℤ_i = ℤ and ℚ_i = ℚ for all i, and S is ℤ - {0}. The problem is about isomorphism as ℚ-vector spaces. The rest of the discussion is about methods or hints, which are not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be as follows.",
