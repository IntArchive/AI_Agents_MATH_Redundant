    "Content": "I'm considering the following sums for natural numbers n,m $$ s_m(n)= \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^m =1^m+2^m+3^m+\\cdots+(n-1)^m $$\nmodulo n . Looking at odd n first, I found by analysis of the pattern of $s_m(n) \\pmod n \\quad $ the following expression \n$$ S_m(n)  = n \\cdot\\sum_{ p \\vert n }   \\underset{p-1}{\\overset m\\sim} \\cdot \\left(1-{1 \\over p}\\right)  $$ where $p \\in \\mathbb P$ and  the fractional-like expression using the $ \\sim $-symbol means $  \\underset{a}{\\overset b\\sim} = \\Tiny \\begin{cases} 1& \\text {if } a \\mid b \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } a \\nmid b\\end{cases}$ It seems, that the two expressions are equivalent modulo n $$ s_m(n) \\equiv S_m(n) \\pmod n$$\nbut after a couple of tries I still don't see how I could prove this. Can someone help? Remark/context: it may be too difficult because I found it while I'm fiddling with the Agoh-Giuga-conjecture, which is still open. On the other hand it is a detail only, has a simple structure involving only the Euler's phi-function and might be easily provable, worth the effort on its own right anyway Remark 2: I approached it also using the Bernoulli-polynomials for the sums, but didn't yet find a usable way for the proof of the identity Remark 3: it seems, it works for even numbers n too, except that a correction is needed if at the same moment n is divisible by 4 and m=1 ; but this shouldn't matter too much for the general question here",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about an expression they found for the sum s_m(n) modulo n. The original problem is to verify if their expression S_m(n) is equivalent to s_m(n) modulo n. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The user mentions looking at odd n first, but later says it works for even n too except for a specific case. However, the main problem seems to be about the equivalence modulo n. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. m is a natural number.\n3. The sum s_m(n) is defined as the sum from k=1 to n-1 of k^m modulo n.\n4. S_m(n) is defined using the formula involving primes dividing n and that fractional-like expression with the ~ symbol, which acts as an indicator function depending on whether p-1 divides m.\n5. The equivalence s_m(n) ≡ S_m(n) mod n is to be proven.\n\nThe user also mentions that for even n, there's a correction if n is divisible by 4 and m=1, but since they say it shouldn't matter for the general question, maybe that's an additional condition not part of the core problem. The problem statement here is to prove the equivalence modulo n.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include that n and m are natural numbers, the definitions of s_m(n) and S_m(n), and the equivalence to be proven. The specific conditions about odd n and even n's correction might be part of the problem's context but not the main assumptions listed. The fractional-like expression using ~ is crucial here, so that's an assumption about how S_m(n) is structured.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Let's check:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- m is a natural number.\n- s_m(n) is the sum from k=1 to n-1 of k^m modulo n.\n- S_m(n) is defined as n multiplied by the sum over primes p dividing n of (indicator function if p-1 divides m) multiplied by (1 - 1/p).\n- The indicator function is 1 if p-1 divides m, else 0.\n- The problem is to prove that s_m(n) ≡ S_m(n) mod n.\n\nWait, in the user's definition, S_m(n) is given as n * sum_{p|n} [indicator_{p-1 divides m} * (1 - 1/p)]. The indicator is part of the formula, so that's part of the assumption about how S_m(n) is constructed. So each of these components should be separate assumptions. Let me structure them properly.\n\nAlso, the problem statement should encapsulate the main task: proving the congruence.",
