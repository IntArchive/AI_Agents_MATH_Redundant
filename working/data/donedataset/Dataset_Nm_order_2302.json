    "Content": "Let $\\alpha (s)$ , $s\\in [0,l]$, be a closed convex plane curve positively oriented.\nThe curve $\\beta(s)=\\alpha (s) -rn(s)$, where $r$ is a positive constant and $n(s)$ is the normal vector, is called a parallel curve to $\\alpha$.\nShow that: $$ \\text{Length}(\\beta)=\\text{Length}(\\alpha) +2\\pi r$$ $$ A(\\beta)=A(\\alpha)+rl+\\pi r^2$$ $$k_{\\beta}(s)=\\frac{k_{\\alpha}(s)}{1+r}$$ where the $k$'s are the curvatures of the corresponding curves. For 1, I used the equation \n$$L(\\beta)=\\int_{0}^{l} \\|\\beta'(s)\\| ds = \\int_{0}^{l} (\\|(1+rk_{\\alpha})\\alpha'(s) \\| +\\tau r |b(s)|) ds =L(\\alpha) (1+rk)+r\\tau$$ I don't see how from this I arrive at equation 1. For 2, in this case it's the area enclosed by the curve, not sure what formulas to use here. Any hints? For 3, I calculated according to the definition of the curvature, where $$k_{\\beta}(s)=\\frac{\\|\\gamma '(s)\\|}{\\|\\beta '(s) \\|}$$ where $\\gamma (s)=\\frac{\\beta '(s)}{\\|\\beta '(s)\\|}$. One of my assumptions is that we're in arclength representation, so $k_{\\alpha}(s)=\\|\\alpha ''(s) \\|$.\nBut I didn't arrive at the same equation, on the contrary it looks like a messy calculation that leads to nowhere.\nI got that $$\\gamma '(s)= \\frac{r^2[r\\tau ^2 k'_{\\alpha}-(1+rk_{\\alpha})\\tau \\tau ']\\alpha '(s)+[(1+rk)k+r\\tau ^2][(1+rk)^2+(r\\tau)^2] n(s) +r\\tau '(1+rk)^2 b(s)}{[(1+rk)^2+(r\\tau)^2]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$$\nI don't see how anything gets simplified here. Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(1) Since this is a plane curve, the torsion $\\tau$ is zero. Without loss of generality we may assume $s$ is the arclength parameter so that $\\|\\alpha'(s)\\|=\\|T\\|=1$ , with $T$ the tangent vector. Compute $$\\beta'=\\alpha'-r(-\\kappa T)=(1+r\\kappa)T.$$ Above we used the Frenet-Serret formulas to differentiate the normal vector. Hence $$L(\\beta)=\\int \\|\\beta'\\|ds=\\int(1+r\\kappa) ds=L(\\alpha)+2\\pi r.$$ Above we used the total curvature identity $\\int \\kappa ds = 2\\pi$ . (2) In order to compute the area of $\\beta$ we will invoke Green's theorem in the $\\mathbb{R}^3$ setting with cross products. Here $B=T\\times N$ is the binormal vector - note that the cross product is antisymmetric, and the area $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\int xdy-ydx$ for the curve $\\beta$ becomes $$A(\\beta)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int(\\beta\\times\\beta')\\cdot B ds$$ $$=\\frac{1}{2}\\int(\\alpha-rN)\\times(1+r\\kappa_{\\alpha})T\\cdot B ds$$ Let's FOIL this into four parts: $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\int (\\alpha\\times T)\\cdot Bds = A(\\alpha)$ because $T=\\alpha'$ . $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\int \\alpha\\times (r\\kappa_\\alpha)T\\cdot B ds=\\tfrac{1}{2}r\\int \\alpha\\times (-dN/ds)\\cdot Bds$ we can rewrite using by-parts integration as $ \\tfrac{1}{2}r\\int T\\times N\\cdot Bds=\\tfrac{1}{2}r L(\\alpha)$ . $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\int (-rN)\\times T\\cdot Bds=\\tfrac{1}{2}r L(\\alpha)$ $\\tfrac{1}{2} \\int (-rN) \\times (r\\kappa_\\alpha T)\\cdot B = \\pi r^2  $ Which makes a total of $A(\\alpha)+rL(\\alpha)+\\pi r^2$ . (3) Now we'll compute $\\kappa_{\\beta}$ with a local formula : $$\\kappa_{\\beta}=\\frac{\\|\\beta'\\times\\beta''\\|}{\\|\\beta'\\|^3}=(1+r\\kappa_{\\alpha})^{-3}\\left\\|(1+r\\kappa_{\\alpha})T\\times\\left(r\\frac{d\\kappa_{\\alpha}}{ds}T+(1+r\\kappa_{\\alpha})\\frac{dT}{ds}\\right)\\right\\|.$$ Note that $T\\times T=0$ and $\\|T \\times T_s\\| = \\kappa_{\\alpha}$ so this simplifies drastically to $$\\kappa_{\\beta}=\\frac{\\kappa_{\\alpha}}{1+r\\kappa_{\\alpha}}.$$ (I assume what you have written in the question is missing a $\\kappa_{\\alpha}$ in the denominator.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the given example. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully. The user is asking about properties of a parallel curve to a closed convex plane curve, specifically regarding length, area, and curvature. There are some attempts shown, but I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, let's identify the assumptions. The problem mentions a closed convex plane curve α(s) where s is in [0,l], and it's positively oriented. Then β(s) is defined as α(s) - r n(s), with r being a positive constant and n(s) the normal vector. The task is to show three things: the length of β, the area enclosed by β, and the curvature of β in terms of α's curvature.\n\nThe user also mentions some of their attempts. For part 1, they used an integral involving the derivative of β, which they expanded but didn't get the desired result. They also mentioned τ and b(s), which makes me think they might be considering a 3D curve, but since the problem is about plane curves, torsion τ should be zero. That might be an error in their calculation. So perhaps the key assumption here is that the curve is planar, hence torsion is zero. Also, the curve is closed and convex, which implies that the curvature k_α is always positive (since convexity requires the curvature to be either always non-negative or always non-positive, and with positive orientation, it's positive). Additionally, being a closed curve means that the total curvature over one period is 2π, which might relate to the length formula involving 2πr.\n\nFor the problem statements, each part needs to be clearly stated. The original problem has three parts: showing the length, the area, and the curvature relation. The user's problem includes all three parts, so I need to present each as the problem to solve.\n\nNow, structuring the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's list:\n\n- α(s) is a closed convex plane curve.\n- α(s) is parametrized by arc length s ∈ [0, l].\n- The orientation of α(s) is positive.\n- β(s) = α(s) − r n(s), where r is a positive constant.\n- n(s) is the normal vector to α(s).\n- The curvature k_α(s) of α(s) is positive (due to convexity and positive orientation).\n- The torsion τ is zero (since it's a plane curve).\n\nWait, but the original problem says it's a plane curve, so torsion is automatically zero. That's an important assumption. Also, since it's closed, the total curvature ∫k_α ds over [0,l] is 2π. But maybe that's a derived property rather than an assumption. The key assumptions are the properties of α and β as given.\n\nSo compiling the assumptions:\n\n- α(s) is a closed convex plane curve for s ∈ [0, l].\n- α(s) is parametrized by arc length.\n- The orientation of α(s) is positive.\n- β(s) is defined as β(s) = α(s) − r n(s), where r is a positive constant.\n- n(s) is the unit normal vector to α(s).\n- The curvature k_α(s) of α(s) is positive.\n- The curve β(s) is a parallel curve to α(s).\n- The torsion τ of α(s) is zero (since it's a plane curve).\n\nWait, maybe some of these can be combined or simplified. For example, \"positively oriented\" might relate to the direction of the normal vector. Also, parametrization by arc length is a standard assumption in differential geometry when dealing with curves, so that's important. The problem states that β is called a parallel curve, which is part of the definition, so that's an assumption.\n\nBut per the example, each assumption is a single line addressing one property. So breaking them down:\n\nAssumption:\n- α(s) is a closed convex plane curve parametrized by arc length s ∈ [0, l].\n- α(s) is positively oriented.\n- β(s) = α(s) − r n(s), where r is a positive constant.\n- n(s) is the unit normal vector to α(s).\n- The curvature k_α(s) of α(s) is positive.\n- The torsion τ of α(s) is zero.\n\nBut maybe the torsion is not an assumption but a consequence of being a plane curve. However, since the user's calculation involved τ, perhaps it's necessary to state that torsion is zero as an assumption. Alternatively, since the problem is about plane curves, torsion is zero by definition, so maybe that's implicit. But to be safe, include it as an assumption because the user's calculation mistakenly included τ, leading to confusion.\n\nNow, the problem parts are three separate statements to prove. The user is asking for all three, so the problem should list all three.\n\nProblem:\nShow that:\n1. The length of β is equal to the length of α plus 2πr.\n2. The area enclosed by β is equal to the area enclosed by α plus r times the length of α plus πr².\n3. The curvature k_β(s) of β is equal to k_α(s) divided by (1 + r).\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are the properties of α and β, and the problem is to show the three equations.",
