    "AcceptedAnswer": "First let\n$$ x = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{a+8}}, \\,\\,  y = \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{b+8}}, \\,\\,  z = \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{c+8}} \\,\\, $$\nThen $1 > x,y,z > 0$ and \n$$ a = \\frac{8x^2}{1 - x^2}, \\,\\,   b = \\frac{8y^2}{1 - y^2}, \\,\\,  c = \\frac{8z^2}{1 - z^2},\\,\\, $$ So the question transforms to this: Given that $1 > x,y,z > 0, \\, \\, \\frac{512x^2y^2z^2}{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)(1 - z^2)} = 1$, prove that $x + y + z \\geqslant 1$. Prove this by contradiction. Suppose on the contrary that $x + y + z < 1$, then $$ \\begin{align}\n(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)(1 - z^2) &= (1 - x)(1 + x)(1 - y)(1 + y)(1 - z)(1 + z) \\\\\n&>(x + x + y + z)(y + z)(x + y + y + z)(x + z)(z + x + y + z)(x + y) \\\\\n&\\geqslant 4x^{\\frac12}y^{\\frac14}z^{\\frac14}\\cdot 2y^{\\frac12}z^{\\frac12} \\cdot 4y^{\\frac12}x^{\\frac14}z^{\\frac14}\\cdot 2x^{\\frac12}z^{\\frac12} \\cdot 4z^{\\frac12}y^{\\frac14}x^{\\frac14}\\cdot 2y^{\\frac12}x^{\\frac12}\\\\\n&=512 x^{\\frac12 + \\frac14 + \\frac12 + \\frac14 + \\frac12}y^{\\frac14 + \\frac12 + \\frac12 + \\frac14 + \\frac12}z^{\\frac14 + \\frac12 +\\frac14 + \\frac12 + \\frac12} \\\\\n&= 512x^2y^2z^2\n\\end{align}$$\nAnd this is contradictory to the condition.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable math professor, so I need to make sure I understand the problem thoroughly before structuring it according to the specified format. Let's start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is to prove that for positive real numbers a, b, c with the constraint abc = 1, the sum of the square roots sqrt(a/(a+8)) + sqrt(b/(b+8)) + sqrt(c/(c+8)) is at least 1. The user mentioned they tried substitutions like x/y, y/z, z/x but ended up with the reverse inequality and is looking for a stronger approach.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given in the original query shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, for this problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. a, b, c are positive real numbers. Each of them is positive, so that's three separate assumptions, but maybe we can combine them into one line as they are all part of the same condition.\n2. The product abc equals 1. That's another condition.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed \"$n$ is an integer\", and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each condition is separate, even if they apply to the same object. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a positive real number.\n- b is a positive real number.\n- c is a positive real number.\n- The product of a, b, and c is 1.\n\nBut maybe the first three can be combined into one line: \"a, b, c are positive real numbers\". The example had separate lines for each property, but in the example, the problem had only one variable, n, with two conditions. Here, a, b, c are all positive reals. The example used two separate lines for n: integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps for multiple variables, we can list them all in one line if they share the same condition. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which in the formatted assumptions becomes \"$n$ is an integer\", and another assumption \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each property is separate. Therefore, in this problem, the positive real numbers a, b, c can each be listed as separate assumptions, but that might be redundant. Alternatively, since they are all positive reals, maybe it's one assumption: \"a, b, c are positive real numbers\". Then the second assumption is \"abc = 1\".\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. a, b, c are positive real numbers.\n2. The product abc equals 1.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the inequality involving the sum of those square roots being at least 1.\n\nThe user tried substitutions like x/y, y/z, z/x but got the reverse inequality. So perhaps a different substitution or approach is needed. But since the task here is just to structure the problem according to the format, not solve it, I need to make sure that the assumptions are correctly extracted and the problem is clearly stated.\n\nLooking back at the example, the formatted problem had the Assumption section with two lines: one for n being an integer and another for n being divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they listed each condition separately. Wait, in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's listed as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was altered. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem example:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. That seems like an error in the example. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. So perhaps the example is not a good model. But according to the user's instruction, I should follow their format. However, in their example, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user wants to list all the necessary conditions, even if some are derived from the problem statement. Hmm, but that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a mistake. But given that, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states: \"If a,b,c are positive reals such that abc=1, then prove that...\". Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. a, b, c are positive real numbers.\n2. The product abc equals 1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these two assumptions. The problem statement is to prove the inequality with these conditions.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is on its own line. In the example, each assumption was on a separate line, even if they applied to the same variable. So for the current problem, even though a, b, c are all positive reals, it's one assumption: \"a, b, c are positive real numbers\". Then the second assumption is \"abc = 1\".\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \na, b, c are positive real numbers,\nabc = 1.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{a+8}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{b+8}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{c+8}} \\geq 1.$$\n\nThat should be correct. The user's example had each assumption on a separate line, even if related. So here, two assumptions: one about the variables being positive reals, and the other about their product. The problem is then to prove the inequality.",
