    "Content": "Removing finitely many point from an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ gives an open set.  Is this true in general for any space? My intuition is that this is the case, however, how does one (dis)prove this? The only idea that comes in mind is that, since singletons are closed and unions of closed sets are closed, a union of singletons is closed. Now, let $U$ be an open set.  Then the complement of $U$ is closed, and any point $x$ removed from $U$ is a singleton that is \"unioned\" with the closed complement of $U$ to form a bigger closed set $C$ . $C$ is the complement of $U\\setminus\\{x\\},$ so $U\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is open. One can thus repeat this argument inductively for any finite number of removed points. Does this make sense?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you allow arbitrary topologies (\"any general space\"), then the answer is no . For any set $M$ with at least two elements you can define a topology $\\mathcal T=\\{\\emptyset, M\\}$ (i.e. only the empty set and $M$ are open sets in $M$ ). Then, by removing one point from $M$ , you get a set which is not open. Edit: Let me add the following: Proposition. Let $(M,\\mathcal T)$ be a topological space. Then the following two statements are equivalent: For every $x\\in M$ , $\\{x\\}$ is closed (i.e. $M\\setminus\\{x\\}\\in\\mathcal T$ ), For every open set $O\\in \\mathcal T$ and point $x\\in M$ , we have that $O\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is also open. Proof. 1. $\\implies$ 2.: Suppose that 1. is true and let $O\\in \\mathcal T$ , $x\\in M$ . Then $M\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is open and hence $$O\\setminus\\{x\\}=O\\cap\\big(M\\setminus\\{x\\}\\big)\\in\\mathcal T.$$ 2. $\\implies$ 1.: Suppose that 2. is true and let $x\\in M$ . Then, since $M$ is open, $M\\setminus\\{x\\}$ is open too, so $\\{x\\}$ is closed. $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether removing finitely many points from an open set will always result in an open set, and they want to know if this holds in any topological space, not just ℝⁿ. They provided some reasoning using closed singletons and unions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. An open set is a set that belongs to the topology on the space. A set is closed if its complement is open. In some spaces, singletons (individual points) are closed sets. For example, in ℝⁿ with the standard topology, singletons are closed because they are the complement of the open set ℝⁿ \\ {x}, which is open. \n\nThe user's argument is: Since singletons are closed, removing a point from an open set U is equivalent to taking the intersection of U with the complement of a closed set (the singleton). Since the complement of a closed set is open, and the intersection of two open sets is open, U minus a point should be open. Then, inductively, removing finitely many points would still keep the set open because each removal is just another intersection with an open set.\n\nBut wait, this relies on the fact that singletons are closed. However, in a general topological space, singletons might not be closed. For example, in the Sierpiński space or in a space with the trivial topology, singletons aren't necessarily closed. So if the space has points that aren't closed, then removing a single point from an open set might not result in an open set. \n\nLet me think of an example. Take the trivial topology on a set X with at least two points. The open sets are X and the empty set. If I remove a point from X, which is open, the result is X \\ {x}, which is not open because the only open sets are X and ∅. So in this case, removing a point from an open set gives a non-open set. Therefore, the statement is not true in general topological spaces. \n\nBut the original question in the title says \"in any space\", so the answer would be no. However, the user's intuition was based on spaces where singletons are closed. So perhaps the correct answer is that it's true if the space is T1 (where singletons are closed), but not in general. \n\nWait, the user's own reasoning assumes that singletons are closed. But the problem is posed for any space. So the answer would be: It's not true in general; however, if the space is such that all singletons are closed (e.g., T1 spaces), then removing finitely many points from an open set will result in an open set. But in spaces where singletons are not closed, this can fail. \n\nSo the key assumption here is that the space is T1, or at least that the points being removed are closed. The problem as stated by the user on Math Stack Exchange is to determine whether the statement holds in any space, and the user's reasoning uses the fact that singletons are closed. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture the original question's intent, which is to (dis)prove whether removing finitely many points from an open set in any space results in an open set. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be that we're working in a general topological space, and the problem is to determine whether removing finitely many points from an open set yields an open set. The answer is no, but to structure the problem as per the example, we need to list the assumptions. However, the original problem doesn't state any specific assumptions beyond the general topological space. The user's own reasoning includes that singletons are closed, which is an assumption not universally true. But the problem as posed doesn't make that assumption. \n\nWait, the user's problem starts with the title: \"Does removing finitely many points from an open set yield an open set?\" Then in the question, they elaborate, asking if this is true in general for any space. So the problem is general. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would just be the general topological space context. But the example provided by the user includes specific assumptions, like n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, the original problem's assumption is that we're working in any topological space. However, since the user's own reasoning assumes that singletons are closed, perhaps the problem should have an assumption that singletons are closed. But the original problem does not state that; the user is questioning if it's true in general. \n\nSo, following the example format, the Assumption section should list any conditions given in the problem. Since the problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange does not specify any conditions on the space, only asks if it's true in general, the Assumption part would need to capture that we are considering any topological space. But the example given by the user includes specific assumptions (like n being integer and divisible by 7). However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the user added another assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. Wait, no, looking back: the original example was a problem where the user wanted to structure the problem with assumptions. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. Then in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps the example is a different problem. Let me check again. The example's original problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions are that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But 91 is 7*13. If n is divisible by 7, maybe that helps, but the original problem was for all integers n. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their own structuring. So maybe they intended to add an assumption. \n\nBut given that, for the current problem, we need to follow the user's example. The user's example took the original problem, which was for all integers n, and added an assumption (n divisible by 7), which wasn't in the original problem. Therefore, perhaps the task is to filter the original problem's assumptions and possibly add any that are implicit. However, in the current problem, the original question is general: does removing finitely many points from an open set yield an open set in any space? The user's own reasoning assumes that singletons are closed. But the problem as posed does not specify any conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would be none except that we are in a topological space. However, the user's own attempt uses properties of closed singletons. \n\nWait, but the example shows that the user added an assumption not present in the original problem. So maybe the task is to structure the problem as given, but list the assumptions explicitly. However, in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Working in a topological space.\n\nBut the example lists specific assumptions about n. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example had an assumption that n is an integer (since the problem says \"for every integer n\"), so that's one assumption, and then the user added another assumption (n divisible by 7) to structure the problem. But that's modifying the problem. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the example is wrong. But given that, perhaps the task is to list all the assumptions present in the original problem. In the current problem, the original question is:\n\n\"Does removing finitely many points from an open set yield an open set? Is this true in general for any space?\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- We have a topological space.\n\n- U is an open set in this space.\n\n- We remove finitely many points from U.\n\nThe problem is to determine whether the resulting set is open.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The space is a topological space.\n\n- U is an open set in the space.\n\n- A finite number of points are removed from U.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that U with finitely many points removed is an open set.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly state \"U is an open set\", but the title says \"removing finitely many points from an open set\", so yes, U is open. So the assumptions are:\n\n- Let the space be a topological space.\n\n- Let U be an open set in the space.\n\n- Let F be a finite set of points removed from U.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be on one line, each addressing one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The space is a topological space.\n\n- U is an open set in the space.\n\n- A finite set of points is removed from U.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the resulting set is open.\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Does removing finitely many points from an open set yield an open set?\" So the problem is to determine this in general. The user's own reasoning assumes that singletons are closed, but that's not given in the problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should not include that as an assumption unless it's part of the original question. Since the original question does not specify any properties of the space beyond being a topological space, the assumptions should just be that we're working in a topological space, U is open, and finitely many points are removed. However, in the example provided by the user, they added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. But perhaps in the example, the original problem had a hidden assumption? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that changes the problem. If n must be divisible by 7, then the original problem's \"for every integer n\" is restricted. That seems like a mistake. Unless there was a misunderstanding. Maybe the original problem was different. But assuming the example is correct as per the user's instruction, perhaps the task is to extract all the conditions that are necessary, even if some are implicit. For instance, in the example, maybe the original problem had a divisibility by 7 but it was phrased differently. However, given the information, the example seems to add an extra assumption. \n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, we should list the assumptions as per the original question, which doesn't assume anything about the space except that it's a topological space. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The space is a topological space.\n\n- U is an open set in the space.\n\n- A finite number of points are removed from U.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that U minus these finitely many points is open.\n\nBut the original problem is phrased as a yes/no question: \"Does removing finitely many points from an open set yield an open set? Is this true in general for any space?\" So the problem is to determine the truth of this statement in general topological spaces.\n\nHowever, to format it according to the example, which turned \"Prove that for every integer n...\" into a problem with specific assumptions, perhaps we need to rephrase the current problem similarly. The example added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original, which seems to be an error. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they expect a similar approach here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in the example, the original problem had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was necessary for the divisibility by 91. Because 91=7*13, and perhaps the expression A(n) is divisible by 91 only when n is divisible by 7. So maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrects it by adding the necessary assumption. But without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nBut focusing back on the current problem: The user's question is whether removing finitely many points from an open set in any space yields an open set. The answer is no, because in some spaces points are not closed, so removing them doesn't preserve openness. The formatted problem should reflect the original question's assumptions. Since the original question doesn't specify any properties of the space beyond being a topological space, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The space is a topological space.\n\n- U is an open set in the space.\n\n- A finite number of points are removed from U.\n\nProblem: Does removing these finitely many points from U yield an open set?\n\nBut the example includes assumptions applied to one object each. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The space is a topological space.\n\n- U is an open set in the space.\n\n- The removed set is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $U$ with a finite number of points removed is open.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is phrased as a yes/no question in the title, but in the body, the user asks to (dis)prove it. So the problem statement can be \"Prove or disprove: Removing finitely many points from an open set in any topological space yields an open set.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be structured with assumptions and the problem statement. The original example's problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So following that, if the current problem's answer requires certain assumptions (like T1 space), but the original question doesn't state them, should we include them? Or is the task to extract assumptions from the original problem as given?\n\nThe user's instruction says: \"filter the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So we need to extract the key assumptions from the original problem. The original problem states: \"Does removing finitely many point from an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ gives an open set. Is this true in general for any space?\" So the first part mentions ℝⁿ, and the second part generalizes to any space. The user's own reasoning discusses singletons being closed, unions of closed sets, etc.\n\nBut the original problem is asking two things: first, the case in ℝⁿ, which they already know is true, and then the general case. However, the title is about the general case. The question body explains their reasoning for the general case, assuming singletons are closed. So perhaps the formatted problem should focus on the general case, with assumptions being:\n\n- Let X be a topological space.\n\n- Let U be an open set in X.\n\n- Let F be a finite subset of U.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that U \\ F is open in X.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be one line, one property per object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- X is a topological space.\n\n- U is an open subset of X.\n\n- F is a finite subset of U.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that U \\ F is open in X.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is specifically about any space, not necessarily ℝⁿ, then the assumptions are as above. The original problem mentions ℝⁿ as a starting point but then asks about any space. So the key problem is in general topological spaces.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- X is a topological space.\n\n- U is an open set in X.\n\n- A finite number of points are removed from U.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the resulting set is open in X.\n\nAlternatively, more precisely:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The space is a topological space.\n\n- U is an open set in the space.\n\n- The set of removed points is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $U$ minus a finite set of points is open.\n\nThis captures the core of the problem. The answer would be that it's not true in general, but true if the space is T1. But the formatted problem should only present the question, not the answer.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem according to the example would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe space is a topological space,\nU is an open set in the space,\nA finite set of points is removed from U.\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the resulting set is open.",
