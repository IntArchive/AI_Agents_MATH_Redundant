    "Content": "Let $\\zeta(s)$ be the Riemann zeta function and $\\gamma$ be the Euler-Mascheroni constant. I observed the following result empirically. Looking for a proof or disproof. $$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sum_{k = 1}^n \\zeta\\Big(k - \\frac{1}{n}\\Big) = \\gamma\n$$ Also, I searched for different summation formulas for the Euler-Mascheroni constant using the Riemann zeta function but could not find it anywhere. Is there any reference to this sum in literature? Update: Applying the method of @Simply Beautiful Art, we can show that $$\n\\sum_{k = 1}^n \\zeta\\Big(k + \\frac{1}{m}\\Big) \n= \\gamma + n + m + \\mathcal O(n^{-1} + m^{-1})\n$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We have the simple asymptotic expansion as $s\\to1$ given by: $$\\zeta(s)=\\frac1{s-1}+\\gamma+\\mathcal O(s-1)\\tag{$s\\to1$}$$ For the first term of your sum, you have $$\\zeta\\left(1-\\frac1n\\right)=-n+\\gamma+\\mathcal O(n^{-1})$$ and for the rest of the terms, \\begin{align}\\sum_{1<k\\le n}\\zeta\\left(k-\\frac1n\\right)&=\\sum_{1<k\\le n}\\left(1+\\sum_{m>1}\\frac1{m^{k-\\frac1n}}\\right)\\tag1\\\\&=n-1+\\sum_{1<k\\le n}\\sum_{m>1}\\frac1{m^{k-\\frac1n}}\\tag2\\\\&=n-1+\\mathcal O(2^{-n})+\\sum_{k>1}\\sum_{m>1}\\frac1{m^{k-\\frac1n}}\\tag3\\\\&=n-1+\\mathcal O(2^{-n})+\\sum_{m>1}\\sum_{k>1}\\frac1{m^{k-\\frac1n}}\\tag4\\\\&=n-1+\\mathcal O(2^{-n})+\\sum_{m>1}\\sqrt[n]m\\frac{m^{-2}}{1-m^{-1}}\\tag5\\\\&=n-1+\\mathcal O(2^{-n})+\\sum_{m>1}\\sqrt[n]m\\left(\\frac1{m-1}-\\frac1m\\right)\\tag6\\\\&=n+\\mathcal O(2^{-n})+\\sum_{m>1}(\\sqrt[n]m-1)\\left(\\frac1{m-1}-\\frac1m\\right)\\tag7\\\\&=n+\\mathcal O(n^{-1})\\tag8\\end{align} where $(1):$ Definition of $\\zeta$ . $(2):$ Summing over $1$ . $(3):$ Extending $k$ from $(1,n]$ to $(1,\\infty)$ , with $\\mathcal O(2^{-n})$ error. $(4):$ Rearranging the series. $(5):$ Geometric series. $(6):$ Partial fractions. $(7):$ Using telescoping series and $1=\\sum_{m>1}\\left(\\frac1{m-1}-\\frac1m\\right)$ . $(8):$ Asymptotic expansion using $\\sqrt[n]m=\\exp(n^{-1}\\ln(m))=1+\\varepsilon n^{-1}\\ln(m)$ , where $|\\varepsilon|\\le\\sqrt[n]m$ , which gives the series bounded by $n^{-1}$ times another series with dominating term $\\mathcal O(m^{\\frac1n-2}\\ln(m))$ and thus converges.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and identify all the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe title of the question is asking whether the limit of a sum involving the Riemann zeta function equals the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The user observed this result empirically and is seeking a proof or disproof. They also mention looking for references in literature and provide an update with a more general formula involving an error term.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement should then be the main question to solve.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem involves the Riemann zeta function ζ(s), the Euler-Mascheroni constant γ, and the limit as n approaches infinity of a sum from k=1 to n of ζ(k - 1/n). The key conditions here are:\n\n1. ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.\n2. γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n3. The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n4. The summation index k runs from 1 to n.\n5. The argument of the zeta function in each term is k - 1/n.\n\nEach of these should be a separate assumption. Additionally, the update mentions a more general sum with k + 1/m, but since that's part of an update and not the original problem, I should focus on the original question. However, the problem statement includes the limit, so the core problem is to determine if that limit equals γ.\n\nWait, in the original example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this problem, the assumptions are more about the functions and the structure of the sum. The user is asking whether the limit equals γ, so the problem is to prove or disprove that equality. The assumptions would be the definitions and the form of the sum.\n\nSo, to list the assumptions:\n\n- ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.\n- γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n- The sum is taken from k = 1 to n.\n- Each term in the sum is ζ(k - 1/n).\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Now, checking the example again, the assumptions were listed as individual points, each on a separate line, addressing one property. So here, each bullet point would be an assumption.\n\nThe problem statement is then to prove or disprove that this limit equals γ. The user also mentions searching for references, but the main problem is the limit equality.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as above, and the problem is the question about the limit equaling γ.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is specific. For example, \"The sum is taken from k = 1 to n\" is one assumption. \"Each term in the sum is ζ(k - 1/n)\" is another. \"The limit is taken as n approaches infinity\" is another. Also, the definitions of ζ and γ are separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should look like:\n\nAssumption:\nζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function,\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nthe sum is from k = 1 to n,\neach term in the sum is ζ(k - 1/n),\nthe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\sum_{k = 1}^n \\zeta\\Big(k - \\frac{1}{n}\\Big) = \\gamma.$$\n\nAdditionally, the user mentioned looking for references, but since the format doesn't include that part, maybe it's part of the problem statement. However, the example only includes the problem to prove. So the main task is to structure the problem as per the format, focusing on the mathematical content.\n\nI need to check if I missed any assumptions. For instance, the domain of the zeta function here: the arguments k - 1/n. Since k starts at 1, when n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the arguments are approaching k from below. For k=1, the argument is 1 - 1/n, which approaches 1. The zeta function has a pole at s=1, so near s=1, ζ(s) behaves like 1/(s-1) + γ + ... So in the sum, when k=1, ζ(1 - 1/n) would be approximately n + γ + ... So maybe that's part of why the sum approaches γ. But that's part of solving the problem, not assumptions. The assumptions are just the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture all these elements as assumptions and present the problem to prove or disprove the equality.",
