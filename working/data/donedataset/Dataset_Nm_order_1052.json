    "Content": "I'm trying to prove this conclusion but have some problems with one of the steps. Assume $X_1,\\ldots,X_n,\\ldots$ is a sequence of Gaussian random variables, converging almost surely to $X$, prove that $X$ is Gaussian. We use characteristics function here. Since $|\\phi_{X_n}(t)|\\leq 1$, by dominated convergent theorem, we have for any $t$ $$\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}e^{it\\mu_n-t^2\\sigma_n^2/2}=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\phi_{X_n}(t) = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{itX_n}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{itX}\\right] = \\phi_X(t)\n$$ this is the step that I cannot figure out : $e^{it\\mu_n-t^2\\sigma_n^2/2}$ converges for any $t$ if and only if $\\mu_n$ and $\\sigma_n$ converges. Let $\\mu=\\lim_n \\mu_n$, and $\\sigma=\\lim_n\\sigma_n$, then $\\phi_X(t)=e^{it\\mu-t^2\\sigma^2/2}$, which proves that $X$ is a Gaussian random variable. Why can we get that $\\mu_n$ and $\\sigma_n$ converge? This looks intuitive for me, but I cannot make a rigorous prove.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, we note that the sequence $\\{\\sigma_n\\}$ and $\\{\\mu_n\\}$ has to be bounded.  It's a consequence of what was done in this thread , as we have in particular convergence in law. What we use is the following: If $(X_n)_n$ is a sequence of random variables converging in distribution to $X$, then for each $\\varepsilon$, there is $R$ such that for each $n$, $\\mathbb P(|X_n|\\geqslant R)\\lt \\varepsilon$ (tightness). To see that, we assume that $X_n$ and $X$ are non-negative (considering their absolute values). Let $F_n$, $F$ the cumulative distribution function of $X_n$, $X$. Take $t$ such that $F(t)\\gt 1-\\varepsilon$ and $t$ is a continuity point of $F$. Then $F_n(t)\\gt 1-\\varepsilon$ for $n\\geqslant N$ for some $N$. And a finite collection of random variables is tight. Now, fix an arbitrary strictly increasing sequence $\\{n_k\\}$. We extract further sub-sequences of $\\{\\sigma_{n_k}\\}$ and $\\{\\mu_{n_k}\\}$, which converge respectively to $\\sigma$ and $\\mu$. Taking the modulus, we can see that $e^{-\\sigma^2/2}=|\\varphi_X(1)|$, so $\\sigma$ is uniquely determined. We have $e^{it\\mu}=\\varphi_X(t)e^{t\\sigma^2/2}$ for all $t\\in\\Bbb R$, so $\\mu$ is also completely determined.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the limit of a convergent sequence of Gaussian random variables is also Gaussian. The user is specifically stuck on why the convergence of the characteristic functions implies the convergence of the mean and variance parameters.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The problem states that we have a sequence of Gaussian random variables X₁, X₂, ..., which converges almost surely to X. The user is using characteristic functions to prove that X is Gaussian. The key step is showing that if the characteristic functions (which are of the form exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) converge, then μₙ and σₙ must converge.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. Each Xₙ is a Gaussian random variable. Since Gaussian variables are characterized by their mean μₙ and variance σₙ², each Xₙ has those parameters.\n2. The sequence Xₙ converges almost surely to X. Almost sure convergence implies convergence in distribution, which relates to the characteristic functions converging.\n3. The characteristic function of Xₙ is given by φₙ(t) = exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2). That's the standard form for a Gaussian's characteristic function.\n4. The limit of φₙ(t) as n→∞ is φ_X(t), which is the characteristic function of X. This comes from the Dominated Convergence Theorem applied to the expectation of e^{itXₙ}.\n5. The user is assuming that the convergence of the exponential expressions (the characteristic functions) implies the convergence of μₙ and σₙ. But they need to verify why this implication holds.\n\nWait, the problem is asking why the convergence of exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) for all t implies that μₙ and σₙ converge. So the key assumption here is that the limit of the characteristic functions exists for all t, and that this limit is also of the form exp(i t μ - t² σ² /2), which would make X Gaussian with parameters μ and σ².\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- Each Xₙ is Gaussian with mean μₙ and variance σₙ².\n- Xₙ converges almost surely to X.\n- The characteristic functions φₙ(t) = exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) converge pointwise to φ_X(t) for all t.\n- The user wants to show that μₙ and σₙ must converge to some μ and σ², respectively, to conclude that φ_X(t) is that of a Gaussian.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user has already applied the DCT to get that φₙ(t) converges to φ_X(t). The confusion is in deducing that μₙ and σₙ must converge. So the core problem is: Given that exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) converges for every t, prove that μₙ and σₙ converge.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list the assumptions related to Xₙ being Gaussian with parameters μₙ, σₙ², their a.s. convergence to X, and the convergence of their characteristic functions. Then the problem is to show that μₙ and σₙ converge.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is to prove X is Gaussian, which relies on showing μₙ and σₙ converge. The user's specific question is about that step.\n\nSo the Assumptions would be:\n\n- For each n, Xₙ is a Gaussian random variable with mean μₙ and variance σₙ².\n- The sequence {Xₙ} converges almost surely to a random variable X.\n- The characteristic function of Xₙ is φₙ(t) = exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2).\n- The limit of φₙ(t) as n→∞ exists for all t and is equal to φ_X(t).\n\nProblem: Prove that if φₙ(t) converges for every t, then the sequences {μₙ} and {σₙ²} converge.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's problem is within the context of proving X is Gaussian, maybe the problem is: Show that the convergence of φₙ(t) = exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) to φ_X(t) implies that μₙ and σₙ converge, hence X is Gaussian with parameters μ and σ².\n\nBut according to the example given, the Assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let me try to structure it.\n\nAssumption:\n- For each positive integer n, Xₙ is a Gaussian random variable.\n- Each Xₙ has mean μₙ and variance σₙ².\n- The sequence {Xₙ} converges almost surely to a random variable X.\n- The characteristic function of Xₙ is φₙ(t) = exp(i t μₙ - (t² σₙ²)/2).\n- The limit as n approaches infinity of φₙ(t) exists for every real number t.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user has already applied DCT to get that φₙ(t) converges to φ_X(t). So maybe the convergence of φₙ(t) is a result of the almost sure convergence. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Xₙ is a Gaussian random variable with mean μₙ and variance σₙ² for each n.\n- Xₙ converges to X almost surely.\n- The characteristic function φₙ(t) = E[e^{itXₙ}] converges to φ_X(t) for all t.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove that μₙ and σₙ converge as n → ∞.\n\nSo the key is to break down each assumption. Let me list each as separate points.\n\nAssumption:\n- For each positive integer n, Xₙ is a Gaussian random variable.\n- Each Xₙ has mean μₙ.\n- Each Xₙ has variance σₙ².\n- The sequence {Xₙ} converges almost surely to a random variable X.\n- The characteristic function φₙ(t) = exp(i t μₙ - (t² σₙ²)/2) converges to φ_X(t) for every real number t.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequences {μₙ} and {σₙ} converge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even more precise. Because the problem is specifically about why the convergence of the characteristic functions (which have that exponential form) implies the convergence of μₙ and σₙ. So the user is not questioning the use of DCT or the convergence of φₙ(t), but rather why from the convergence of the exponential expressions we can infer the convergence of μₙ and σₙ.\n\nHence, the problem is: Given that for each t ∈ ℝ, the limit as n→∞ of exp(i t μₙ - (t² σₙ²)/2) exists, prove that μₙ and σₙ converge as n→∞.\n\nBut to frame it within the original problem's context, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each n, Xₙ is a Gaussian random variable with mean μₙ and variance σₙ².\n- The characteristic function of Xₙ is φₙ(t) = exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2).\n- The limit of φₙ(t) as n→∞ exists for every real number t.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequences {μₙ} and {σₙ²} converge.\n\nBut the user's original problem is part of a larger proof that X is Gaussian. But in their specific question, they are focusing on the step where the convergence of the characteristic functions implies convergence of μₙ and σₙ. So the problem is isolated to that step.\n\nAnother approach: The user's question is: \"Why can we get that μₙ and σₙ converge?\" given that exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) converges for any t. So the problem is about the convergence of the parameters in the characteristic function of Gaussians.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each n, μₙ is a real number.\n- For each n, σₙ is a non-negative real number.\n- For every real number t, the limit as n approaches infinity of exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) exists.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequences {μₙ} and {σₙ} converge.\n\nBut in the original context, σₙ² is the variance, so σₙ is non-negative. So perhaps more precisely, σₙ² is a non-negative real number, but σₙ is non-negative.\n\nBut in the example provided, the user had assumptions about the object's properties. In this case, each Xₙ being Gaussian with mean μₙ and variance σₙ². So to structure the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each positive integer n, Xₙ is a Gaussian random variable.\n- Each Gaussian random variable Xₙ has mean μₙ.\n- Each Gaussian random variable Xₙ has variance σₙ².\n- The characteristic function of Xₙ converges pointwise to a function φ(t) as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequences {μₙ} and {σₙ²} converge.\n\nBut maybe even more precise. Since the characteristic function's convergence is given, which is exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) → φ(t) for all t. So the problem is: Given that the limit of exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) exists for every t, show that μₙ and σₙ² converge.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each positive integer n, μₙ is a real number.\n- For each positive integer n, σₙ² is a non-negative real number.\n- For every real number t, the limit as n approaches infinity of exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) exists.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequences {μₙ} and {σₙ²} converge.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem's context is necessary. The user mentions that the sequence Xₙ converges almost surely to X, and using characteristic functions, they want to show X is Gaussian. The step in question is deducing μₙ and σₙ converge from the convergence of their characteristic functions.\n\nBut according to the example, the Assumption section should list all the conditions applied to each object. So in the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, each Xₙ is Gaussian with mean μₙ and variance σₙ², and the characteristic functions converge.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each positive integer n, Xₙ is a Gaussian random variable.\n- Each Xₙ has mean μₙ.\n- Each Xₙ has variance σₙ².\n- The sequence {Xₙ} converges almost surely to a random variable X.\n- The characteristic function of Xₙ is φₙ(t) = exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2).\n- For every real number t, the limit of φₙ(t) as n approaches infinity exists.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequences {μₙ} and {σₙ²} converge.\n\nBut wait, the almost sure convergence leads to convergence in distribution, hence convergence of characteristic functions. The problem is within that framework. However, the user's specific problem is about the step where the convergence of the characteristic functions (which are in the Gaussian form) implies the convergence of μₙ and σₙ. So perhaps the key assumptions are just that the limit of the Gaussian characteristic functions exists, and then the problem is to show that μₙ and σₙ must converge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe to separate the problem from the original context, since the user is stuck on that specific step, which is a mathematical problem about complex exponents: if exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) converges for every t, then μₙ and σₙ converge.\n\nSo structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each positive integer n, μₙ is a real number.\n- For each positive integer n, σₙ is a non-negative real number.\n- For every real number t, the sequence {exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2)} converges as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequences {μₙ} and {σₙ} converge.\n\nThis seems more precise. Because the original problem's context is about the parameters of the Gaussian, but the specific step is a general result: if the sequence of functions of the form exp(i t μₙ - t² σₙ² /2) converges pointwise for all t, then μₙ and σₙ must converge. So the problem is isolated to that.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each positive integer n, μₙ is a real number.\n- For each positive integer n, σₙ is a non-negative real number.\n- For every real number t, the limit of exp(i t μₙ - (t² σₙ²)/2 as n approaches infinity exists.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequences {μₙ} and {σₙ} converge.\n\nYes, this seems to capture the essence. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property of one object. The first two lines define μₙ and σₙ, the third line states the convergence of the exponential function for all t. The problem is to show convergence of μₙ and σₙ.\n\nI think this is the correct structure. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the user structured the assumption as n is integer, n divisible by 7, and the problem to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, but 91 is 7*13, so the original problem may have required n to be divisible by both 7 and 13? Or maybe the original assumptions were different. But in the example, they listed the assumptions as n is integer and n divisible by 7, then problem to prove divisibility by 91. Hmm, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user's instruction is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn our case, the three assumptions: μₙ is real, σₙ non-negative, and the exponential converges for all t. Then problem is to show μₙ and σₙ converge.\n\nYes, that follows the example's structure. So the final answer should be structured as such.",
