    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about the series expansion of the rational function (1 - x²)/(1 - a x + 2 x²). The user expanded this and noticed that starting from x⁴, every sixth polynomial in the series has a factor of (a² - 6). They want to prove this pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The given series expansion is:\n\n1 + a x + (a² - 3) x² + (a³ - 5a) x³ + (a⁴ - 7a² + 6) x⁴ + ...\n\nThey mention that the coefficient of x⁴ is (a⁴ - 7a² + 6), which factors into (a - 1)(a + 1)(a² - 6). Then they observe that from x⁴ onwards, every sixth term shares the factor (a² - 6). So, for example, x⁴, x¹⁰, x¹⁶, etc., coefficients have (a² - 6) as a factor.\n\nMy task is to prove that this periodicity of 6 exists, starting at x⁴, such that every sixth polynomial in the expansion has (a² - 6) as a factor.\n\nLet me start by recalling that the series expansion of a rational function can be obtained via partial fractions or recurrence relations. Since the denominator is 1 - a x + 2 x², maybe I can express the generating function as a power series and find a recurrence relation for the coefficients.\n\nLet’s denote the generating function as G(x) = (1 - x²)/(1 - a x + 2 x²). Let’s write G(x) as a power series Σ_{n=0}^∞ c_n x^n, where c_n are the coefficients in terms of a. The problem is about the coefficients c_4, c_10, c_16, etc., each having a factor of (a² - 6).\n\nFirst, I need to find a general expression for c_n or at least a recurrence relation that the coefficients satisfy.\n\nGiven that G(x) = (1 - x²)/(1 - a x + 2 x²), let's denote the denominator as D(x) = 1 - a x + 2 x². Then, G(x) = (1 - x²) * [1/D(x)]. The expansion of 1/D(x) is a power series, and multiplying by (1 - x²) would adjust the coefficients accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since G(x) * D(x) = 1 - x², we can use this to derive a recurrence relation. Let me try that.\n\nLet’s suppose that 1/D(x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ b_n x^n. Then, G(x) = (1 - x²) * Σ_{n=0}^∞ b_n x^n = Σ_{n=0}^∞ b_n x^n - Σ_{n=0}^∞ b_n x^{n+2} = Σ_{n=0}^∞ b_n x^n - Σ_{n=2}^∞ b_{n-2} x^n. Therefore, the coefficients c_n of G(x) are:\n\nc_0 = b_0\n\nc_1 = b_1\n\nc_n = b_n - b_{n-2} for n ≥ 2\n\nNow, since D(x) * Σ_{n=0}^∞ b_n x^n = 1, we can find a recurrence relation for b_n.\n\nMultiply D(x) = 1 - a x + 2 x² by Σ_{n=0}^∞ b_n x^n:\n\n(1 - a x + 2 x²)(b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x² + b_3 x³ + ...) = 1\n\nExpanding the product:\n\n= b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x² + b_3 x³ + ... \n- a x (b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x² + ...)\n+ 2 x² (b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x² + ...)\n= 1\n\nCollecting terms by powers of x:\n\nFor x^0: b_0 = 1\n\nFor x^1: b_1 - a b_0 = 0 ⇒ b_1 = a b_0 = a\n\nFor x^2: b_2 - a b_1 + 2 b_0 = 0 ⇒ b_2 = a b_1 - 2 b_0 = a² - 2\n\nFor x^n (n ≥ 3): b_n - a b_{n-1} + 2 b_{n-2} = 0 ⇒ b_n = a b_{n-1} - 2 b_{n-2}\n\nSo, the recurrence relation for b_n is:\n\nb_0 = 1\n\nb_1 = a\n\nFor n ≥ 2: b_n = a b_{n-1} - 2 b_{n-2}\n\nThen, the coefficients c_n of G(x) are:\n\nc_0 = b_0 = 1\n\nc_1 = b_1 = a\n\nFor n ≥ 2: c_n = b_n - b_{n-2}\n\nBut since b_n follows the recurrence b_n = a b_{n-1} - 2 b_{n-2}, then substituting into c_n:\n\nc_n = (a b_{n-1} - 2 b_{n-2}) - b_{n-2} = a b_{n-1} - 3 b_{n-2}\n\nBut also, from the relation G(x) = (1 - x²)/D(x), perhaps there's a direct recurrence for c_n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a recurrence for c_n directly.\n\nGiven that G(x) = (1 - x²)/D(x), then D(x) G(x) = 1 - x². Let's write this as:\n\n(1 - a x + 2 x²)(c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x² + c_3 x³ + ...) = 1 - x²\n\nExpanding the left-hand side:\n\nc_0 + (c_1 - a c_0) x + (c_2 - a c_1 + 2 c_0) x² + (c_3 - a c_2 + 2 c_1) x³ + ... = 1 - x²\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nFor x^0: c_0 = 1\n\nx^1: c_1 - a c_0 = 0 ⇒ c_1 = a\n\nx^2: c_2 - a c_1 + 2 c_0 = -1 ⇒ c_2 = a c_1 - 2 c_0 - 1 = a² - 2 -1 = a² - 3\n\nx^3: c_3 - a c_2 + 2 c_1 = 0 ⇒ c_3 = a c_2 - 2 c_1 = a(a² - 3) - 2a = a³ - 3a - 2a = a³ - 5a\n\nx^4: c_4 - a c_3 + 2 c_2 = 0 ⇒ c_4 = a c_3 - 2 c_2 = a(a³ - 5a) - 2(a² - 3) = a⁴ - 5a² - 2a² + 6 = a⁴ - 7a² + 6\n\nWhich matches the given coefficient for x^4. So the recurrence for c_n is:\n\nFor n ≥ 4: c_n = a c_{n-1} - 2 c_{n-2}\n\nWait, but when equating coefficients for x^n (n ≥ 3), we have:\n\nThe coefficient of x^n in the product is c_n - a c_{n-1} + 2 c_{n-2} = 0 for n ≥ 3, except for x² where it equals -1. Wait, the right-hand side is 1 - x², so for n=0: 1, n=2: -1, and others zero.\n\nTherefore, the general recurrence is:\n\nFor n = 0: c_0 = 1\n\nFor n = 1: c_1 = a\n\nFor n = 2: c_2 = a c_1 - 2 c_0 - 1 = a² - 2 -1 = a² - 3\n\nFor n ≥ 3: c_n - a c_{n-1} + 2 c_{n-2} = 0 ⇒ c_n = a c_{n-1} - 2 c_{n-2}\n\nWait, but for n=2, the coefficient was -1, so the equation is c_2 - a c_1 + 2 c_0 = -1. That's why c_2 is different. So the recurrence for n ≥ 3 is homogeneous, but n=2 is a special case.\n\nSo the general recurrence is:\n\nc_0 = 1\n\nc_1 = a\n\nc_2 = a² - 3\n\nFor n ≥ 3: c_n = a c_{n-1} - 2 c_{n-2}\n\nBut the user mentions that from x^4 onwards, every sixth polynomial shares the factor (a² - 6). So the coefficient c_4, c_{10}, c_{16}, etc., have (a² - 6) as a factor.\n\nGiven that c_4 = (a^4 - 7a² + 6) = (a² - 6)(a² -1). So (a² -6) is a factor.\n\nSimilarly, let's check c_{10}. But calculating that directly would be tedious. Instead, we need to find a pattern or periodicity modulo (a² -6).\n\nThe idea is that if we consider the recurrence relation modulo (a² -6), then the coefficients c_n might have a periodicity of 6. That is, every 6 steps, the coefficients repeat modulo (a² -6). If that's the case, then if c_4 ≡ 0 mod (a² -6), then c_{4 +6k} ≡ 0 mod (a² -6).\n\nAlternatively, if we can show that when a² =6, then c_4 =0, c_{10}=0, etc., which would imply that (a² -6) divides those coefficients.\n\nSo, perhaps substituting a² =6 into the recurrence and showing that c_n =0 when n ≡4 mod6.\n\nAlternatively, to show that for a²=6, c_{6k +4}=0 for k≥0.\n\nLet me try that approach. Suppose a² =6. Then, let's see what happens to the coefficients.\n\nGiven a²=6, let's compute the coefficients:\n\nc_0=1\n\nc_1=a\n\nc_2= a² -3 =6 -3=3\n\nc_3= a c_2 -2 c_1 = a*3 -2a =3a -2a =a\n\nc_4= a c_3 -2 c_2 =a*a -2*3 =a² -6=6 -6=0\n\nc_5= a c_4 -2 c_3 =a*0 -2a= -2a\n\nc_6= a c_5 -2 c_4 =a*(-2a) -2*0= -2a² -0= -2*6= -12\n\nc_7= a c_6 -2 c_5 =a*(-12) -2*(-2a)= -12a +4a= -8a\n\nc_8= a c_7 -2 c_6 =a*(-8a) -2*(-12)= -8a² +24= -8*6 +24= -48 +24= -24\n\nc_9= a c_8 -2 c_7 =a*(-24) -2*(-8a)= -24a +16a= -8a\n\nc_{10}=a c_9 -2 c_8 =a*(-8a) -2*(-24)= -8a² +48= -8*6 +48= -48 +48=0\n\nc_{11}=a c_{10} -2 c_9 =a*0 -2*(-8a)=16a\n\nc_{12}=a c_{11} -2 c_{10}=a*(16a) -2*0=16a²=16*6=96\n\nc_{13}=a c_{12} -2 c_{11}=a*96 -2*16a=96a -32a=64a\n\nc_{14}=a c_{13} -2 c_{12}=a*64a -2*96=64a² -192=64*6 -192=384 -192=192\n\nc_{15}=a c_{14} -2 c_{13}=a*192 -2*64a=192a -128a=64a\n\nc_{16}=a c_{15} -2 c_{14}=a*64a -2*192=64a² -384=64*6 -384=384 -384=0\n\nSo indeed, when a²=6, we have c_4=0, c_{10}=0, c_{16}=0, etc. Therefore, for a²=6, the coefficients at positions 4,10,16,… are zero. Hence, (a² -6) is a factor of those coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to showing that when a²=6, the coefficients c_{6k +4}=0 for k ≥0.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the recurrence relation under the substitution a²=6 and show that the sequence of c_n has zeros at n=4,10,16,...\n\nLooking at the recurrence when a²=6:\n\nGiven a²=6, let’s denote that a can be √6 or -√6, but since the coefficients are polynomials in a, we can treat a as a variable and substitute a²=6, hence we can perform all computations modulo (a² -6). So in the ring of polynomials modulo (a² -6), the recurrence becomes a linear recurrence with coefficients in that ring.\n\nBut let me see, perhaps a better way is to find the recurrence relation for the c_n when a²=6. Let’s note that a²=6, so we can replace any occurrence of a² with 6. But how does this affect the recurrence?\n\nThe recurrence is c_n = a c_{n-1} - 2 c_{n-2} for n ≥3.\n\nIf we can express this recurrence in terms of lower terms, perhaps we can find a periodicity.\n\nGiven that for n ≥3, c_n = a c_{n-1} -2 c_{n-2}\n\nLet me compute c_0 to c_16 with a²=6 as before:\n\nn | c_n\n0 | 1\n1 | a\n2 | 3\n3 | a\n4 | 0\n5 | -2a\n6 | -12\n7 | -8a\n8 | -24\n9 | -8a\n10| 0\n11|16a\n12|96\n13|64a\n14|192\n15|64a\n16|0\n\nObserving this, starting from c₄=0, let's see the pattern:\n\nFrom c₄=0,\n\nc₅=-2a,\n\nc₆=-12,\n\nc₇=-8a,\n\nc₈=-24,\n\nc₉=-8a,\n\nc₁₀=0,\n\nc₁₁=16a,\n\nc₁₂=96,\n\nc₁₃=64a,\n\nc₁₄=192,\n\nc₁₅=64a,\n\nc₁₆=0,\n\nSo the pattern from c₄ onwards is:\n\n0, -2a, -12, -8a, -24, -8a, 0, 16a, 96, 64a, 192, 64a, 0,...\n\nNoticing that every 6 steps after c₄, we return to zero. For example, c₄=0, c₁₀=0, c₁₆=0, etc. So the period here is 6. Therefore, the zeros occur every 6 terms starting at n=4.\n\nTherefore, in the case when a²=6, the coefficients c_n are zero at positions n=4 +6k. This implies that (a² -6) divides each of those coefficients c_{6k +4} in the original polynomial.\n\nHence, the original problem's observation is proven: from x⁴ onwards, every sixth polynomial (coefficient) shares a factor of (a² -6).\n\nTo formalize this proof, we can proceed by induction. Assume that for some k ≥0, c_{6k +4}=0 when a²=6. Then, show that c_{6(k+1)+4}=c_{6k +10}=0. However, since we have already computed the specific terms and observed the periodicity, induction might be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence with a²=6 leads to a periodic sequence with period 6 starting from n=4, this can be shown by analyzing the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients. Let's consider the recurrence for c_n when a²=6:\n\nc_n = a c_{n-1} -2 c_{n-2}\n\nThe characteristic equation is r² - a r +2=0\n\nSolving for r:\n\nr = [a ± sqrt(a² -8)]/2 = [a ± sqrt(6 -8)]/2 = [a ± sqrt(-2)]/2\n\nBut sqrt(-2) is imaginary, so the roots are complex: r = [a ± i√2]/2\n\nHowever, modulus of these roots can be calculated. Let’s compute |r|:\n\n|r|² = (a/2)² + (√2/2)² = (a²)/4 + (2)/4 = (6)/4 + 0.5 = 1.5 +0.5=2. So |r|=sqrt(2). Thus, the roots have magnitude sqrt(2), and argument θ where tanθ= (√2/2)/(a/2)= √2/a. Since a²=6, a=√6 or -√6, so tanθ= √2/√6=1/√3 ⇒ θ=30 degrees or π/6 radians. Hence, the roots can be written as sqrt(2) e^{±iπ/6}, leading to solutions of the form c_n = (sqrt(2))^n (C cos(nπ/6) + D sin(nπ/6))\n\nGiven the modulus sqrt(2)^n, but when a²=6, the solutions might have periodicity related to the angle π/6, leading to period 12, but our observed period is 6. However, due to the specific initial conditions, perhaps the period is shorter.\n\nAlternatively, since the characteristic roots are r1 and r2 with r1^6 = (sqrt(2) e^{iπ/6})^6 = (2^{1/2})^6 e^{iπ} = 8 e^{iπ}= -8\n\nSimilarly, r2^6= (sqrt(2) e^{-iπ/6})^6=8 e^{-iπ}= -8\n\nTherefore, r1^6 = r2^6 = -8. Hence, the sequence might satisfy a recurrence relation of period 12, but due to the real and imaginary parts combining, perhaps a shorter period.\n\nBut our observed sequence when a²=6 has period 6 for the zeros. However, from the earlier computations, the zeros occur every 6 terms. So perhaps the period is indeed 6 in this case.\n\nBut given the complex roots, it's more likely that the general solution is a combination of terms with period 12, but due to the specific coefficients and initial conditions, certain terms cancel out, leading to a shorter effective period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the real and imaginary parts lead to a period of 12, but since we are dealing with integer coefficients and specific substitutions, the period observed is 6.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that in the specific case when a²=6, the recurrence c_n = a c_{n-1} -2 c_{n-2} can be analyzed modulo (a² -6). Since we are working in the ring where a²=6, we can express higher powers of a in terms of lower powers. For example, a³ = a*(a²)=a*6=6a, a⁴=a*(a³)=a*6a=6a²=36, etc. Wait, no: if a²=6, then a³=6a, a⁴=6a²=36, a⁵=36a, a⁶=6*36=216, etc. But in our recurrence, we might be able to reduce higher powers.\n\nHowever, since the recurrence for c_n when a²=6 is linear with coefficients involving a, but a is treated as a variable subject to a²=6. Thus, the recurrence can be considered over the field Q(a)/(a² -6), which is a field extension of Q. In this field, every polynomial in a can be reduced to degree less than 2.\n\nSo, for example, any term like a c_{n-1} would be a linear term in a, since c_{n-1} is in Q(a)/(a² -6). So the sequence c_n can be seen as vectors in the 2-dimensional vector space over Q with basis {1, a}. Therefore, the recurrence can be represented as a matrix, and the periodicity can be analyzed through the powers of this matrix.\n\nLet’s attempt this approach.\n\nDefine the state vector as [c_n, c_{n+1}]^T. The recurrence is c_{n+1} = a c_n -2 c_{n-1}\n\nBut we can write this as:\n\nc_{n+1} = a c_n -2 c_{n-1}\n\nLet me express this as a matrix multiplication. Let’s define the vector V_n = [c_{n-1}, c_n]^T. Then, V_{n+1} = [c_n, c_{n+1}]^T = [c_n, a c_n -2 c_{n-1}]^T = [0 1; -2 a] V_n\n\nSo the transition matrix M is:\n\nM = [ [0, 1],\n      [-2, a] ]\n\nBut since we're working modulo (a² -6), we can reduce any occurrence of a² to 6. However, the entries of M are in the ring Q[a]/(a² -6). So when we raise M to the power of 6, perhaps we get the identity matrix, leading to periodicity.\n\nBut computing M^6:\n\nLet’s compute M^2 first:\n\nM^2 = M * M\n\n= [ [0,1], [-2,a] ] * [ [0,1], [-2,a] ]\n\n= [ [0*0 +1*(-2), 0*1 +1*a ],\n     [ -2*0 +a*(-2), -2*1 +a*a ] ]\n\n= [ [-2, a],\n     [ -2a, a² -2 ] ]\n\nBut a²=6, so M^2 becomes:\n\n[ [-2, a],\n  [ -2a, 6 -2 ] ] = [ [-2, a],\n                      [ -2a, 4 ] ]\n\nM^3 = M^2 * M\n\n= [ [-2, a], [-2a,4] ] * [ [0,1], [-2,a] ]\n\nFirst row:\n\n-2*0 +a*(-2) = -2a\n\n-2*1 +a*a = -2 + a² = -2 +6=4\n\nSecond row:\n\n-2a*0 +4*(-2)= -8\n\n-2a*1 +4*a = -2a +4a=2a\n\nSo M^3 = [ [-2a,4], [-8,2a] ]\n\nM^4 = M^3 * M\n\n= [ [-2a,4], [-8,2a] ] * [ [0,1], [-2,a] ]\n\nFirst row:\n\n-2a*0 +4*(-2) = -8\n\n-2a*1 +4*a = -2a +4a=2a\n\nSecond row:\n\n-8*0 +2a*(-2)= -4a\n\n-8*1 +2a*a = -8 +2a²= -8 +12=4\n\nSo M^4= [ [-8,2a], [-4a,4] ]\n\nM^5 = M^4 * M\n\n= [ [-8,2a], [-4a,4] ] * [ [0,1], [-2,a] ]\n\nFirst row:\n\n-8*0 +2a*(-2)= -4a\n\n-8*1 +2a*a= -8 +2*6= -8 +12=4\n\nSecond row:\n\n-4a*0 +4*(-2)= -8\n\n-4a*1 +4*a= -4a +4a=0\n\nSo M^5= [ [-4a,4], [-8,0] ]\n\nM^6 = M^5 * M\n\n= [ [-4a,4], [-8,0] ] * [ [0,1], [-2,a] ]\n\nFirst row:\n\n-4a*0 +4*(-2)= -8\n\n-4a*1 +4*a= -4a +4a=0\n\nSecond row:\n\n-8*0 +0*(-2)=0\n\n-8*1 +0*a= -8\n\nSo M^6= [ [-8,0], [0,-8] ] = -8 * I\n\nTherefore, M^6 = -8 I, where I is the identity matrix.\n\nTherefore, M^6 = -8 I. Then, M^12 = (M^6)^2 = (-8 I)^2 =64 I.\n\nSo, every 6 multiplications, we get a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. This implies that the transformation has a period of 12, but scaled by -8 each 6 steps.\n\nHowever, in our case, since we're dealing with the state vectors V_n = [c_{n-1}, c_n]^T, applying M^6 would multiply the vector by -8. Therefore, V_{n+6} = M^6 V_n = -8 V_n.\n\nTherefore, c_{n+6} = -8 c_n.\n\nBut wait, when a²=6, we observed that c₄=0, c_{10}=0, etc. So, starting from c₄=0, then c_{10}= -8 c₄=0, c_{16}= -8 c_{10}=0, and so on. This aligns with our earlier computations.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation when a²=6 satisfies c_{n+6} = -8 c_n. Therefore, if c_n=0, then c_{n+6}=0. Since c₄=0, it follows by induction that c_{4 +6k}=0 for all k ≥0.\n\nHence, for each k ≥0, c_{6k +4}=0 when a²=6, which implies that (a² -6) divides the coefficient c_{6k +4} in the original expansion. Therefore, the original observation is proven: from x⁴ onwards, every sixth polynomial in the series shares a factor of (a² -6).\n\nTo summarize, the key steps are:\n\n1. Derive the recurrence relation for the coefficients c_n of the generating function.\n\n2. Substitute a²=6 into the recurrence to find that c₄=0 and c_{n+6}= -8 c_n.\n\n3. Conclude by induction that c_{6k +4}=0 for all k ≥0 when a²=6, hence (a² -6) is a factor of each such c_{6k +4}.\n\nTherefore, the problem is structured by recognizing the periodicity in the recurrence relation when factoring out (a² -6), leading to zeros every sixth term starting at n=4.",
