To show that $G$ and $G'$ are isomorphic, we wish to come up with a natural isomorphism between the two functors. This is how Awodey does it: For any $D\\in\\mathcal{D}$ and any $C\\in\\mathcal{C}$ , we have that $\\Hom(C,GD)\\cong \\Hom(FC,D)\\cong \\Hom(C,G'D)$ simply using the hom-set definition of adjunctions. By the Yoneda principle, this means that $GD\\cong G'D$ for all $D\\in\\mathcal{D}$ . Awodey then states that But this isomorphism is natural in $D$ , again by adjointness . I dont' quite understand how the naturality follows from adjointness. Any help is appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The bijection $\\hom(C,GD) \\cong \\hom(C,G'D)$ is natural in $C$, thus it is induced by an isomorphism $GD \\cong G'D$ (Yoneda Lemma). But it is also natural in $D$, and since the Yoneda embedding is faithful, this means that $GD \\cong G'D$ is natural in $D$. More details: If $D \\to E$ is a morphism, then $\\begin{array}{ccc} GD & \\rightarrow & G'D \\\\ \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\ GE & \\rightarrow & G'E \\end{array}$ commutes iff for every $C$ the diagram $\\begin{array}{ccc} \\hom(C,GD) & \\rightarrow & \\hom(C,G'D) \\\\ \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\ \\hom(C,GE) & \\rightarrow & \\hom(C,G'E) \\end{array}$ commutes.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about the uniqueness of adjoint functors up to isomorphism. Specifically, they mention that if a functor F has two right adjoints G and G', then these two functors must be naturally isomorphic. The user understands the part where using the hom-set adjunction and Yoneda lemma gives an isomorphism between GD and G'D for each object D, but they're confused about how the naturality in D follows from adjointness.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. An adjunction between F and G gives a natural isomorphism between Hom(FC, D) and Hom(C, GD) for all C in C and D in D. Similarly, if G' is also a right adjoint to F, then we have a natural isomorphism between Hom(FC, D) and Hom(C, G'D). \n\nBy composing these isomorphisms, we get Hom(C, GD) ≅ Hom(C, G'D) naturally in C. Then Yoneda's lemma tells us that this isomorphism is induced by a unique morphism GD → G'D. Since this is an isomorphism for each C, it should be that GD ≅ G'D. But the user is stuck on why this isomorphism is natural in D.\n\nThe key here is that the original adjunction isomorphisms are natural in both C and D. So when we compose the two adjunction isomorphisms, the resulting isomorphism Hom(C, GD) ≅ Hom(C, G'D) is natural in both variables. The Yoneda lemma applies in the C variable, giving an isomorphism GD ≅ G'D that is natural in D because the entire construction respected the naturality in D through the adjunctions. \n\nAlternatively, since the adjunction isomorphisms are natural in D, the isomorphism between GD and G'D constructed via Yoneda should also vary naturally with D. That is, the morphisms GD → G'D are components of a natural transformation, and since each component is an isomorphism, it's a natural isomorphism.\n\nSo, the naturality in D comes from the fact that the adjunction isomorphisms are natural in D. When we apply Yoneda, the resulting isomorphism isn't just object-wise but respects the morphisms in D, hence naturality.\n\nThe assumptions here would involve the properties of adjoint functors, the hom-set isomorphisms being natural in both variables, and the application of Yoneda's lemma to obtain the isomorphism between G and G'. The problem is to show the naturality of the isomorphism between G and G' that comes from their both being right adjoints to F.",
