    "Content": "I am currently self studying Baby Rudin and I'm having some problems with his proof of Theorem 3.20(a) on page 58. I have read all previous chapters and I can't find any mention of real exponents besides its definition in the exercise section of Chapter 1 (but nothing about order/this identity).\nHe defines $x^a$ for rational $a$ and $x>1$ then this is used to extend it to all real $a$ by $x^a = \\sup \\{x^t : t \\leq a,~ t \\in Q\\}$. Am I missing something or does he expect the reader to fill this huge gap in the proof? Prefatory note on parts for Theorem 3.20: We shall now compute the limits of some sequences which occur frequently. The proofs will all be based on the following remark: If $0\\leq x_n\\leq s_n$ for $n\\geq N$, where $N$ is some fixed number, and if $s_n\\to 0$, then $x_n\\to 0$. Theorem 3.20 (a): If $p>0$, then $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^p}=0$. Proof. Take $n>(1/\\varepsilon)^{1/p}$. (Note that the archimedean property of the real number system is used here.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "\"Am I missing something or he expects the reader to fill this huge gap in the proof?\" It's not only a gap in the proof, Rudin hasn't even defined what $1/n^p$ means for real $p>0.$ In fact beyond integer powers, he has only defined $a^p$ for $a\\ge 0$ and $p=1/n$ for some $n\\in \\mathbb {N}.$ Yes, there are the exercises in Chapter 1 concerning rational and real powers, but the whole lot of them make for a huge expenditure of effort at that point. I don't think this is one of Rudin's finest moments.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the Math Stack Exchange question.\n\nThe user is talking about Rudin's proof of Theorem 3.20(a), specifically the part where he uses the identity (x^a)^b = x^{ab} for real exponents a and b without proving it. They mention that Rudin defines x^a for rational a and x > 1, then extends it to real a via supremum. The question is whether Rudin assumes this identity without proof, and the user is confused because they can't find prior discussion about real exponents or this identity in the previous chapters.\n\nSo, the main problem here is about the validity of assuming (x^a)^b = x^{ab} for real numbers a and b without proof in the context of Rudin's \"Principles of Mathematical Analysis.\" The assumptions would include the definitions and conditions Rudin uses for real exponents. \n\nAssumptions need to be listed one per line, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the relevant parts:\n\n1. The definition of x^a for rational a and x > 1. \n2. The extension of x^a to real a using the supremum: x^a = sup{x^t | t ≤ a, t ∈ Q}.\n3. The problem is about the identity (x^a)^b = x^{ab} for real a and b.\n4. The context is Theorem 3.20(a) in Baby Rudin, which deals with the limit of 1/n^p as n approaches infinity.\n\nWait, the user is asking why Rudin didn't prove the identity (x^a)^b = x^{ab} when using it in the proof. The user is pointing out that Rudin hasn't discussed real exponents beyond their definition. So the problem is about whether Rudin assumes this identity without proof, and perhaps the user wants to see how it can be proven given the definitions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are based on Rudin's definitions, and the problem is whether the identity holds under those definitions without further proof.\n\nLet me check the example given. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in this case, the assumptions would be the definitions Rudin provides for real exponents, and the problem is the validity of the identity (x^a)^b = x^{ab} for real a, b under those definitions.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a real number greater than 1.\n- a and b are real numbers.\n- For rational a, x^a is defined as usual.\n- For real a, x^a is defined as the supremum of {x^t | t ≤ a, t ∈ Q}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x^a)^b = x^{ab} for real numbers a and b using the definition x^a = sup{x^t | t ≤ a, t ∈ Q}.\n\nBut wait, in the original question, the user is pointing out that Rudin uses this identity in his proof of Theorem 3.20(a) without proving it. The problem, as per the user, is whether Rudin assumes this identity without proof. But the user might be asking for a proof of that identity given Rudin's definitions, or questioning the gap. So perhaps the problem statement here is to either confirm if that identity is indeed assumed without proof in Rudin's text or to actually prove it based on the given definitions.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem part is the mathematical statement that needs to be proven. So in this case, the problem would be \"Prove that (x^a)^b = x^{ab} for real numbers a and b, given Rudin's definition of real exponents.\"\n\nBut let me check the original question again: \"Rudin assumes (x^a)^b=x^{ab} (for real a and b) without proof?\" The user is asking if Rudin did that, but in terms of formatting for the problem, perhaps the problem is to prove that identity under Rudin's definitions. So the assumptions are the definitions from Rudin, and the problem is to prove the identity.\n\nSo, compiling:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number greater than 1,\na is a real number,\nb is a real number,\nx^a for rational a is defined as usual,\nx^a for real a is defined as sup{x^t | t ≤ a, t ∈ Q}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x^a)^b = x^{ab} for real numbers a and b.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user is not necessarily asking to prove it, but questioning whether Rudin assumes it without proof. However, the example given by the user converts the original problem into a structured problem where the task is to prove something. So perhaps the user wants the problem structured as \"Prove that (x^a)^b = x^{ab} for real a and b under Rudin's definitions.\"\n\nThus, the assumptions would be the definitions Rudin provides, and the problem is to prove the identity.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is one per line, each applied to one object. Let me list each assumption separately:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx > 1,\na is a real number,\nb is a real number,\nFor rational t, x^t is defined as usual,\nFor real a, x^a is defined as sup{x^t | t ≤ a, t ∈ Q}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x^a)^b = x^{ab}.\n\nBut wait, in the original question, the user is pointing out that Rudin used this identity in his proof of Theorem 3.20(a). Let me check Theorem 3.20(a): If p > 0, then lim_{n→∞} 1/n^p = 0. The proof involves taking n > (1/ε)^{1/p}. The user is confused because Rudin uses the identity (x^a)^b = x^{ab} in the proof, but hasn't proven it for real exponents. So the problem is really about that identity in the context of real exponents as defined by Rudin. Therefore, the structured problem should be to prove that identity under Rudin's definitions.\n\nBut maybe the user's question is more about whether Rudin skipped the proof, but the task here is to structure the problem, not answer the historical question. So the problem would be \"Prove that (x^a)^b = x^{ab} for real numbers a and b using Rudin's definition of real exponents.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are Rudin's definitions, and the problem is to prove the identity.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number greater than 1.\n- a and b are real numbers.\n- For rational exponents t, x^t is defined in the usual way.\n- For real exponents a, x^a is defined as the supremum of the set {x^t | t ≤ a, t ∈ ℚ}.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that (x^a)^b = x^{ab}.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property. Let me check:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx > 1,\na is a real number,\nb is a real number,\nFor each rational number t, x^t is defined as usual,\nFor real a, x^a is defined as sup{x^t | t ≤ a, t ∈ ℚ}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (x^a)^b = x^{ab}.\n\nThat should fit the format. Each assumption is a single line, each applies to one object or condition. The problem is clearly stated.",
