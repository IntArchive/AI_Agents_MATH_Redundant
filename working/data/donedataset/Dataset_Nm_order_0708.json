    "Content": "How do I prove $\\sin x$ is uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb R$ with delta and epsilon? I proved geometrically that $\\sin x<x$ and thus, $$|f(x_1)-f(x_2)|=|\\sin x_1 - \\sin x_2|\\le|\\sin x_1|+|\\sin x_2|<|x_1|+|x_2|$$ But this doesn't help me much finding a delta... Thanks for any help! P.S. I'm only at the beginning of calculus so I can't use many theorems and derivation  (because they haven't been regorously proven).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the example they provided. The original problem was about proving that a certain expression is divisible by 91. The formatted version listed assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example has a mistake? Hmm, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example given, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be an error. Wait, maybe the example is correct because perhaps the original problem was miswritten, or maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, the key takeaway is that the assumptions should list all the conditions applied to each object, one per line.\n\nNow, looking at the current problem from Math Stack Exchange: The user wants to prove that sin x is uniformly continuous on R using delta and epsilon. The original question mentions they can't use many theorems or derivatives because they're at the beginning of calculus. So the assumptions here would be related to the properties of sin x and the conditions given.\n\nFirst, let me parse the original question. The problem is to prove that sin x is uniformly continuous on R. The user tried to use the inequality |sin x1 - sin x2| <= |x1| + |x2| but that didn't help find delta. The user mentions they can't use advanced theorems or derivatives.\n\nSo, what are the assumptions here? Let's see. The function in question is sin x. The domain is all real numbers. The user is working within the context of delta-epsilon definitions, and cannot use theorems like Lipschitz continuity (since derivative is bounded, but that might require knowing the derivative of sin x, which the user might not have). So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function is f(x) = sin x.\n- The domain of f is ℝ.\n- The definition of uniform continuity must be proven using the epsilon-delta method.\n- The user cannot use advanced theorems or derivatives.\n\nBut according to the example given, assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = sin x,\nThe domain of f is ℝ,\nUniform continuity must be proven using the epsilon-delta definition,\nAvailable techniques exclude advanced theorems and derivatives.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem doesn't state that the user cannot use certain things, but the problem itself. The problem's requirements are that the proof must use delta and epsilon, and the user cannot use many theorems. However, in the example, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps the example had an error, but the key is that assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. So in this case, the problem is to prove sin x is uniformly continuous on R, using epsilon-delta, without advanced theorems or derivatives. But is that part of the problem's conditions or the user's constraints? The problem says \"I'm only at the beginning of calculus so I can't use many theorems and derivation\". So that's part of the problem's context, so perhaps we need to include that as an assumption.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = sin x,\nThe domain of f is ℝ,\nThe proof must use the epsilon-delta definition of uniform continuity,\nThe available methods exclude advanced theorems and derivatives.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the objects in the problem. Here, maybe the first two are about the function and domain, and the latter two are constraints on the proof method. But according to the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions here should include the properties of the function and the constraints given in the problem. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = sin x,\nThe domain of f is ℝ,\nThe proof must use the epsilon-delta method,\nAdvanced theorems and derivatives are not allowed.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each line addresses one property or condition. So the problem is then \"Prove that sin x is uniformly continuous on ℝ.\"",
