    "Content": "This question struck me when thinking about the fixed point of $x=\\cos(x)$ being \"obviously\" not an algebraic number (unlike something like $\\sqrt{2}$, see this question ). If so, how would one prove this? I don't see how something like a simple application of the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem would work in this case. I understand that the mere fact that it is a root of a so-called transcendental equation doesn't amount to very much, since $x=\\tan(x)$ has at least one root (0) which is algebraic.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem states that given $\\alpha_1,\\ldots, \\alpha_n$ algebraic numbers that are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$ , then $e^{\\alpha_1},\\ldots, e^{\\alpha_n}$ are algebraically independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e. for any rational function $P(z_1,\\ldots, z_n)$ with algebraic coefficients it follows that $P(e^{\\alpha_1},\\ldots, e^{\\alpha_n})\\neq 0$ ).  As a result, with $n=1$ we find that if $\\alpha$ is algebraic that is non-zero, then $e^\\alpha$ is transcendental. Now, suppose that $a$ is algebraic; then $ia$ is also algebraic because $i$ is algebraic and the set of all algebraic numbers is a field.  Next, consider the rational function $P(z)=\\frac{z^2-(2\\cos a) z + 1}{2z}$ and assume for the sake of a contradiction that $\\cos a$ is algebraic. $P(z)$ is not identically zero and has algebraic coefficients, but $P(e^{ia})=0$ by the definition $\\cos a=\\frac{e^{ia}+e^{-ia}}{2}$ , contradicting the assumption that $a$ is algebraic by Lindemann-Weierstrass. Thus, we find that if $a$ is a non-zero algebraic number, then $\\cos a$ is transcendental.  As a result, if $a$ is a complex number such that $a=\\cos a$ , then if $a$ is algebraic, $\\cos a=a$ is transcendental, giving a contradiction.  Since $a\\neq 0$ because $\\cos 0 = 1$ , we find that $a$ is transcendental.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if the root of x = cos(x) is transcendental and how to prove it. First, I need to recall what a transcendental number is—it's a number that isn't a root of any non-zero polynomial equation with integer coefficients. So, the question is whether the solution to x = cos(x) is such a number.\n\nThe original question mentions that the fixed point of x = cos(x) is \"obviously\" not algebraic, unlike sqrt(2). But the user is skeptical and wants a proof. They also note that using Lindemann-Weierstrass might not be straightforward here. Additionally, they point out that just because an equation is transcendental (like x = tan(x)) doesn't mean its roots are transcendental; for example, x=0 is a solution to x = tan(x) but is algebraic.\n\nSo, the key is to analyze the specific equation x = cos(x) and determine the nature of its root. Let's think about known results. The Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem states that if a is algebraic and not zero, then e^a is transcendental. Since cos(a) can be expressed in terms of exponentials (Euler's formula), maybe there's a way to use this theorem.\n\nSuppose the solution α satisfies α = cos(α). If α were algebraic, then cos(α) would also be algebraic since cosine of an algebraic number isn't necessarily transcendental. Wait, but Lindemann-Weierstrass says that e^{iα} is transcendental if α is algebraic and non-zero. Let's see: e^{iα} = cos(α) + i sin(α). If α is algebraic, then by Lindemann-Weierstrass, e^{iα} would be transcendental, which would imply that both cos(α) and sin(α) are transcendental (since the sum of a transcendental and an algebraic is transcendental). But in our case, α = cos(α). So if α were algebraic, then cos(α) is algebraic, which would make e^{iα} transcendental. But α is cos(α), so substituting, we have α = cos(α), which would mean that α is algebraic. But then e^{iα} is transcendental. However, from Euler's formula, if both α and cos(α) are algebraic, does that lead to a contradiction? Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, consider the equation α = cos(α). Suppose α is algebraic. Then, by the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, since cos(α) can be written as (e^{iα} + e^{-iα})/2, if α is algebraic and non-zero, then e^{iα} is transcendental, so cos(α) would be transcendental. But if α is algebraic, then cos(α) must be transcendental, which contradicts the equation α = cos(α), because the left side would be algebraic and the right side transcendental. Hence, α must be transcendental.\n\nWait, that seems like a valid argument. Let me check again. If α is algebraic, then by Lindemann-Weierstrass, e^{iα} is transcendental. Therefore, cos(α) = (e^{iα} + e^{-iα})/2 would be the sum of two transcendental numbers. However, the sum of two transcendentals isn't necessarily transcendental. For example, e + (1 - e) = 1. So that approach might not directly work. But in our case, α = cos(α), so if α is algebraic, then cos(α) is algebraic, but according to Lindemann-Weierstrass, cos(α) should be transcendental. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, α must be transcendental.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the key assumption here is that α is a solution to α = cos(α), and we need to assume that α is algebraic to reach a contradiction via Lindemann-Weierstrass. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that if α = cos(α), then α cannot be algebraic.\n\nSo, structuring the problem as per the user's format:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Here, the main assumption is that α is a root of the equation x = cos(x). But to apply Lindemann-Weierstrass, we would assume α is algebraic. So the problem is to prove that such an α is transcendental. Wait, the original problem asks \"Is the root of x=cos(x) a transcendental number? If so, how to prove this?\" So the user wants to know whether it's transcendental and how to prove it.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption that α satisfies α = cos(α), and the problem is to prove that α is transcendental. But maybe the assumptions need to be broken down. Let me see the example given. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is one condition per line, applied to one object.\n\nIn this case, the key assumption is that α is a real number such that α = cos(α). So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a real number,\nα = cos(α).\n\nProblem:\nProve that α is a transcendental number.\n\nBut wait, maybe more precise. The equation x = cos(x) has a unique real solution (the Dottie number). So the problem is about that specific number. The assumptions are that α satisfies the equation, and the problem is to prove it's transcendental.\n\nYes, that's the structure. So each assumption is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a real number,\nα satisfies the equation α = cos(α).\n\nProblem:\nProve that α is a transcendental number.\n\nThat should be the formatted version.",
