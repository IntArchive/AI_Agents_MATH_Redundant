    "Content": "If $a_i\\geq0,a_n\\not\\equiv 0,$ prove  $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}{n}$ diverges. I have known that if $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty a_n$converges, then  $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty \\sqrt[n]{a_1a_2\\cdots a_n}$and $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{n}{\\frac{1}{a_1}+\\frac{1}{a_2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{a_n}}$converges, but how can I prove $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}{n}$ diverges? Sincerely thanks for your help. Add : Such stupid as I am, we do not need the condition $\\sum a_n$ converges. Strictly, rewrite $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}{n}=\\sum\\limits_{n=k}^\\infty\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}{n}\\geq a_k\\sum\\limits_{n=k}^\\infty\\frac 1n\\to \n\\infty$, where $a_k$ is the first $a_i\\neq 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to format this problem correctly based on the example provided. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the original problem from the user's question. The title of the question is \"If $a_i\\geq 0,$ prove $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}{n}$ diverges.\" The question body repeats this and adds some context about related series and a partial proof attempt.\n\nIn the example given, the assistant extracted the assumptions and the core problem. The key here is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem here: The user states that $a_i \\geq 0$ and $a_n \\not\\equiv 0$. So these are two separate assumptions. The first is that each term $a_i$ is non-negative. The second is that the sequence $a_n$ is not identically zero; in other words, there exists at least one term in the sequence that is positive. \n\nThe problem is to prove that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n}{n}$ diverges under these assumptions. \n\nWait, in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"If $a_i\\geq0,a_n\\not\\equiv 0,$ prove...\". So the two assumptions here are that all $a_i$ are non-negative, and the sequence $a_n$ is not identically zero. \n\nI should list these as two separate assumptions. Each assumption should be on its own line. \n\nSo for the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nEach $a_i$ is non-negative,\nThe sequence $a_n$ is not identically zero.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}{n}$ diverges.\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The user mentions in their question that they initially thought about the case where $\\sum a_n$ converges, but later realized that's not needed. The problem as stated doesn't require $\\sum a_n$ to converge; in fact, even if $\\sum a_n$ diverges, the given series must diverge. So the core assumptions are just the non-negativity of the terms and the sequence not being all zeros.\n\nThe user's added note mentions that if you take the first non-zero term $a_k$, then the series from $n=k$ onwards is bounded below by $a_k \\sum_{n=k}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n}$, which diverges. This seems like a hint towards the solution, but for the problem structuring, we just need the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the two assumptions listed, and the problem statement as given.",
