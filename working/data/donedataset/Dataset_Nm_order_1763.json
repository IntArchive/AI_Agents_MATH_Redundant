    "Content": "My math teacher gave us problems to work on proofs, but this problem has been driving me crazy. I tried to factor or find patterns in the numbers and all I can come up with is that for $n > 0$, the number $\\mod 100$ is $51$ but that does not help. There is definitely an easy way to do this but I can't think of it. Thanks if you can help Prove that for any nonnegative integer $n$ the number $5^{5^{n+1}} + 5^{5^n} + 1$  is not prime.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Letting $x=5^{5^{n}},$ we have that $$5^{5^{n+1}}+5^{5^{n}}+1=x^{5}+x+1.$$  Now the claim follows since $$x^{5}+x+1=\\left(x^{2}+x+1\\right)\\left(x^{3}-x^{2}+1\\right).$$ Added: This may be of interest to the reader.  This problem, along with KCd's comment, motivated the following question , asking whether or not $$x^n+x+1$$ is irreducible when $n\\not\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$, and $n\\geq 1$.  Alex Jordan's answer there referred to a paper of Ernst Selmer which proves that this polynomial is indeed irreducible for these $n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The problem states that for any nonnegative integer n, the number \\(5^{5^{n+1}} + 5^{5^n} + 1\\) is not prime. So, I need to show that this expression is composite for all nonnegative integers n.\n\nFirst, let's parse the expression. It has three terms: \\(5^{5^{n+1}}\\), \\(5^{5^n}\\), and 1. The exponents themselves are powers of 5, which grow extremely quickly. For n=0, the exponent 5^{n} would be 5^0=1, so the expression becomes \\(5^{5^{1}} + 5^{1} + 1 = 5^5 + 5 + 1 = 3125 + 5 + 1 = 3131\\). Let me check if 3131 is prime. Hmm, 3131 divided by, say, 7: 7*447=3129, so remainder 2. Maybe 13? 13*240=3120, remainder 11. Wait, maybe 3131 is prime? But the problem states it should not be. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let's check again. 5^5 is 3125, plus 5 is 3130, plus 1 is 3131. Now, checking 3131: does it divide by 3? 3*1043=3129, remainder 2. 5? Ends with 1, so no. 7? As before. 11? 11*284=3124, remainder 7. 13? As before. 17? 17*184=3128, remainder 3. 19? 19*164=3116, remainder 15. 23? 23*136=3128, remainder 3. Maybe 29? 29*107=3103, remainder 28. 31? 31*100=3100, 3131-3100=31, so 31*101=3131. Oh! Wait, 31*101 is 3131. So 3131 is 31*101, which are both primes, so 3131 is composite. So for n=0, it's composite. Okay, that's good.\n\nNow, for n=1, the expression becomes \\(5^{5^{2}} + 5^{5^1} + 1 = 5^{25} + 5^5 + 1\\). That's a huge number. Obviously, we can't compute this directly, but we need to show it's composite. The problem is to find a factorization or some property that shows it's not prime.\n\nThe user mentioned trying to factor or find patterns, and modulo 100 gives 51 for n>0. Let's check that. For n=0, modulo 100: 3131 mod 100 is 31. For n=1: 5^{25} mod 100. Since 5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125 mod 100=25, so from 5^2 onwards, it's 25, 25, etc. So 5^{25} mod 100 is 25. Then 5^5 is 3125 mod 100=25. So 25 + 25 +1=51 mod 100. So yes, for n>=1, the number ends with 51. But as the user says, that doesn't directly help.\n\nThe key here might be to find a factorization. The expression resembles the form of a sum of terms that could fit into a polynomial factorization. For example, the sum of cubes: a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc factors, but that's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe something similar to a geometric series or using properties of exponents.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that the exponents are 5^{n+1} and 5^n. Let me denote m = 5^n. Then the expression becomes 5^{5*m} + 5^m + 1. Wait, 5^{5*m} is (5^m)^5. So the expression is x^5 + x + 1 where x = 5^{5^n}. Hmm, does x^5 + x + 1 factor? Let me check. For example, x^5 + x + 1. Let me try plugging x=1: 1 +1 +1=3. x=2: 32 +2 +1=35. Not helpful. Wait, maybe it factors as (x^2 + x +1)(x^3 -x^2 +1). Let me multiply these out: (x^2 + x +1)(x^3 -x^2 +1) = x^5 -x^4 +x^2 +x^4 -x^3 +x +x^3 -x^2 +1 = x^5 + x +1. Yes! So x^5 + x +1 factors into (x^2 + x +1)(x^3 -x^2 +1). Therefore, if we can write the expression as x^5 +x +1, then it's composite.\n\nIn our problem, x is 5^{5^n}. So substituting back, the expression is ( (5^{5^n})^2 + 5^{5^n} +1 ) ( (5^{5^n})^3 - (5^{5^n})^2 +1 ). Therefore, the original number is a product of two numbers greater than 1, hence composite. Therefore, it's not prime.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let's take n=0. Then x=5^{5^0}=5^1=5. The expression becomes 5^5 +5 +1=3125+5+1=3131, which factors as (5^2 +5 +1)(5^3 -5^2 +1)= (25+5+1)(125-25+1)=31*101=3131, which matches. For n=1, x=5^{5^1}=5^5=3125. Then the factors are (3125^2 +3125 +1) and (3125^3 -3125^2 +1), both of which are clearly greater than 1. Therefore, the expression factors as such for any nonnegative integer n, hence it's composite.",
