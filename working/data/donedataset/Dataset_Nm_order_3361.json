    "Content": "I am trying to prove: If a sequence is monotone and bounded then it converges. My idea is: Assume $a_n$ is monotone and not converges and then show that it is not bounded. But: my problem is that I fail to prove it is not bounded. Please can you help me? I found a different proof in a book but I want to know if my proof can work.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\langle x_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\rangle$ be a bounded, monotone sequence in $\\Bbb R$; without loss of generality assume that the sequence is non-decreasing. To prove that it converges, at some point you’re going to have to use the fact that $\\Bbb R$ is complete: the theorem is not true in $\\Bbb Q$. The most straightforward way to use completeness is simply to let $a=\\sup\\{x_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\}$, which exists by completeness because the sequence is bounded, and show that $\\langle x_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\rangle\\to a$. I don’t see any way to carry out your idea without essentially incorporating this argument as part of it, and if you do that, you’re just needlessly complicating things.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the user's question. They want to prove that every bounded monotone sequence converges. Their approach is to assume the sequence is monotone and does not converge, then show it's not bounded. But they're stuck on proving it's unbounded.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem correctly. The main statement to prove is \"If a sequence is monotone and bounded, then it converges.\" The user attempted a proof by contradiction: assume the sequence is monotone and doesn't converge, hence it must be unbounded. But they can't show the unbounded part.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement is to prove convergence given those assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original statement. Wait, no, in the example, the user might have restructured the problem but the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem was different. Hmm, but the user is asking me to follow the example structure. But in their example, the formatted problem includes an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that might be a mistake. But perhaps in the example, maybe the user intended to add an assumption? Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo or the user restructured it. Wait, maybe the user made an error in the example. But regardless, I need to follow their format.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about proving that a bounded monotone sequence converges. The user's approach is by contradiction: assume it's monotone and not convergent, hence show it's unbounded. But they can't do that.\n\nSo the problem statement should be structured as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sequence is monotone.\n- The sequence is bounded.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence converges.\n\nBut wait, the user's approach was to assume the sequence is monotone and not convergent, then show it's unbounded. But the standard proof is to use the monotone convergence theorem, which directly shows that a monotone bounded sequence converges by using the least upper bound or something similar. The user is trying a contrapositive: if a monotone sequence does not converge, then it is not bounded. So in their approach, the assumptions would be that the sequence is monotone and does not converge, and the problem is to show it's unbounded.\n\nBut the original problem is to prove that \"If a sequence is monotone and bounded, then it converges.\" So the user is attempting to prove the contrapositive. Therefore, to structure their problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sequence is monotone.\n- The sequence does not converge.\n\nAnd the problem would be to show that the sequence is not bounded.\n\nBut in the example provided earlier, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. So perhaps the example is wrong, but I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nWait, no, maybe the example is correct. Let me check again. Original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption is n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would restrict n to multiples of 7, which contradicts the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user still wants me to follow the format. Maybe in the example, there was a miscommunication. But regardless, I have to process the current problem.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The user's original problem is to prove that a bounded monotone sequence converges. The user is trying to do a contrapositive: assume it's monotone and not convergent, then show it's unbounded. So their problem structure would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sequence is monotone.\n- The sequence does not converge.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence is not bounded.\n\nBut the original problem's statement is the converse: if monotone and bounded, then converges. So the contrapositive is: if monotone and not convergent, then not bounded. So the user's problem is to prove the contrapositive. Therefore, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption: The sequence is monotone.\nAssumption: The sequence does not converge.\nProblem: Prove that the sequence is not bounded.\n\nBut the user mentions in their question that they found a different proof in a book (probably the standard one) but want to know if their approach can work. So the problem they are working on is proving the contrapositive. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions of the contrapositive's hypothesis: monotone and not convergent, and the problem is to show it's unbounded.\n\nHence, the correct structure should be:\n\nAssumption: The sequence is monotone.\nAssumption: The sequence does not converge.\nProblem: Prove that the sequence is not bounded.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property per object. So \"The sequence is monotone\" and \"The sequence does not converge\" are two separate assumptions.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: The sequence is monotone.\nAssumption: The sequence does not converge.\nProblem: Prove that the sequence is not bounded.",
