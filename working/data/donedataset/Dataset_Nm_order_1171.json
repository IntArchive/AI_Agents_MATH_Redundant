    "Content": "Please prove that $\\sqrt 2 + \\sqrt 3$ is irrational. One of the proofs I've seen goes: If $\\sqrt 2 +\\sqrt 3$ is rational, then consider $(\\sqrt 3 +\\sqrt 2)(\\sqrt 3 -\\sqrt 2)=1$, which implies that $\\sqrt 3 − \\sqrt 2$ is rational. Hence, $\\sqrt 3$ would be rational. It is impossible. So $\\sqrt 2 +\\sqrt 3$ is irrational. Now how do we know that if $\\sqrt 3 -\\sqrt 2$ is rational, then $\\sqrt 3$ should be rational? Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "if $a,b$ are rational, so is $a+b$ ... As $\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}$ are rational, so is $\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}=2\\sqrt{3}$ if $a,ab$ are rational, so is $b$ ... As $2,2\\sqrt{3}$ are rational so is $\\sqrt{3}$ ... here we have used two statements if $a,b$ are rational, so is $a+b$ ... if $a,ab$ are rational, so is $b$ ... convince your self that these results can be seen easily.. If not, for first ststement: As you can see if $a=\\frac{p}{q},b=\\frac{r}{s}$ then $a+b=\\frac{ps+qr}{qs}$ and for second statement suppose $a=\\frac{p}{q}$ and $ab=\\frac{r}{s}$ then $b=\\frac{qr}{ps}$ P.S : I like your idea $(\\sqrt 3 +\\sqrt 2)(\\sqrt 3 -\\sqrt 2)=1$ to prove irrationality... :)That is the reason I have tried to help you... all the best",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that √2 + √3 is irrational. The question also mentions a specific proof they've seen and a point of confusion about why √3 - √2 being rational would imply √3 is rational.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The original problem is to prove that the sum of √2 and √3 is irrational. The assumptions here would be the basic properties of rational and irrational numbers. Let's see.\n\nThe proof provided assumes that if √2 + √3 is rational, then (√3 + √2)(√3 - √2) = 1 implies that √3 - √2 is also rational. Then, adding these two expressions (√2 + √3 and √3 - √2) would give 2√3, which would then be rational if both original terms are rational. Hence, √3 would be rational, which is a contradiction since we know √3 is irrational. Therefore, the initial assumption that √2 + √3 is rational must be false.\n\nThe user's confusion is about why √3 - √2 being rational leads to √3 being rational. The key step here is that adding two rational numbers gives a rational number. So if both (√2 + √3) and (√3 - √2) are rational, their sum (which is 2√3) must also be rational. Dividing by 2 (a rational number) preserves rationality, so √3 would be rational. But since √3 is known to be irrational, this is a contradiction.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions should list each individual condition applied to one object. The problem statement is straightforward.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. √2 is irrational.\n2. √3 is irrational.\n3. The sum of two rational numbers is rational.\n4. The product of two rational numbers is rational.\n5. The difference of two rational numbers is rational.\n6. If a number is rational, its additive inverse is rational.\n7. If a number is rational and non-zero, its multiplicative inverse is rational.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nWait, but the original problem's assumptions in the example included specific conditions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions are more about the properties of the numbers involved and the operations on rationals. However, the user's question is about understanding the step in the proof, so perhaps the assumptions should include the properties used in that specific proof.\n\nBut according to the example given, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. In the original problem, the user is asking to prove that √2 + √3 is irrational. The known facts here are that √2 and √3 are individually irrational, and the properties of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. However, in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). For this problem, the key assumptions are the irrationality of √2 and √3, and the closure properties of rational numbers under addition and multiplication.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions should be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n√2 is irrational,\n√3 is irrational,\nThe sum of two rational numbers is rational,\nThe product of two rational numbers is rational.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that their sum is irrational. The given proof uses the fact that if the sum were rational, then the product (√3 + √2)(√3 - √2) = 1 implies that √3 - √2 is rational. Then adding √3 + √2 and √3 - √2 gives 2√3, which would be rational, hence √3 is rational, contradicting the known irrationality of √3.\n\nSo the critical assumptions here are the irrationality of √2 and √3, and the closure properties of rational numbers under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (by non-zero). Therefore, in the assumptions, we need to list each of these properties as separate lines.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each closure property is a separate assumption, and each known irrationality is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n√2 is irrational,\n√3 is irrational,\nThe sum of two rational numbers is rational,\nThe difference of two rational numbers is rational,\nThe product of two rational numbers is rational,\nThe multiplicative inverse of a non-zero rational number is rational.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nThis covers all the necessary properties used in the proof. The user's confusion was about why √3 - √2 being rational implies √3 is rational, which relies on adding the two expressions (which are assumed rational) to get 2√3, hence rational. Thus, the sum and difference properties are critical.",
