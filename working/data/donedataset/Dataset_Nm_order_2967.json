    "AcceptedAnswer": "Maybe. Can we prove it? The answer has to be no. Since there may be an infinite number of primes $p_{n+1}-p_n = 2,$ and since we cannot now prove that there is a prime between $n^2$ and $(n+2)^2$ for all n, the answer seems clear-cut.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nThe original question is asking whether there's always a prime between the squares of two consecutive primes. The user provided a table with examples where such primes exist. The problem is to prove that for each natural number n, there's a prime p such that p_n squared is less than p less than p_{n+1} squared.\n\nNow, looking at the assumptions. The example given in the problem uses natural number n, and the primes p_n and p_{n+1} are consecutive primes. The assumption section should list each condition applied to one object. So, the first assumption is that n is a natural number. Then, p_n and p_{n+1} are consecutive prime numbers. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's about p_n and p_{n+1} being consecutive primes. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- p_n is the nth prime number.\n- p_{n+1} is the (n+1)th prime number.\n\nBut in the problem, the key conditions are that we're looking at the squares of these consecutive primes and a prime p between them. The problem is to show that such a prime always exists. The original problem doesn't state any additional constraints on n, so the assumptions are just that n is natural and p_n, p_{n+1} are consecutive primes. \n\nThe problem statement then is asking to prove that there exists a prime p in the interval (p_n^2, p_{n+1}^2) for each natural number n. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a natural number.\n- p_n is the nth prime number.\n- p_{n+1} is the (n+1)th prime number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a prime number p such that p_n^2 < p < p_{n+1}^2.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the assumption section had two points: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So each assumption is a separate line addressing one condition of one object.\n\nIn this case, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. p_n and p_{n+1} are consecutive primes.\n\nBut in the example, they listed two separate assumptions for the same object (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\np_n is a prime number,\np_{n+1} is the next prime number after p_n.\n\nBut wait, p_n is defined as the nth prime, so the fact that p_{n+1} is the next prime is inherent. Maybe it's redundant to state that. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are just that n is natural, and p_n denotes the nth prime. Then the problem is about consecutive primes. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\np_n is the nth prime number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a prime number p such that p_n^2 < p < p_{n+1}^2.\n\nYes, because p_{n+1} is by definition the next prime after p_n. So the key assumptions are that n is natural and p_n is the nth prime. So that's two assumptions, each on separate lines. The third line would be about the interval between their squares, but that's part of the problem statement. Wait, no, the problem is to prove the existence, so the assumptions are the conditions given. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user included the assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants to follow their format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's original problem had a mistake. Wait, no. Let me see: the original problem in the example is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So the problem becomes to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's changing the original problem. That seems like an error. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect. Therefore, maybe I should follow the user's instructions regardless of the example's correctness.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem. The example given by the user may not be accurate, but I need to follow their structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is: \"Is there always a prime number between p_n^2 and p_{n+1}^2?\" The problem provides a table and asks for a proof that for each natural number n, there exists a prime p in that interval.\n\nSo assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- p_n is the nth prime number.\n- p_{n+1} is the (n+1)th prime number.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that between their squares there's a prime. So the problem is as stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are just that n is a natural number and p_n, p_{n+1} are consecutive primes. But in the problem statement, p_n and p_{n+1} are defined as consecutive primes because they're the nth and (n+1)th primes. So the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- p_n and p_{n+1} are consecutive primes.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem, the key is that p_n and p_{n+1} are consecutive primes, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- p_n is a prime number.\n- p_{n+1} is the next prime number after p_n.\n\nBut p_n is already the nth prime, so the next prime is p_{n+1}. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- p_n denotes the nth prime number.\n\nBecause given that, p_{n+1} is automatically the next prime. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\np_n is the nth prime number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a prime number p such that p_n^2 < p < p_{n+1}^2.\n\nYes, this seems correct. The problem doesn't state any additional constraints, so the assumptions are simply that n is natural and p_n is the nth prime. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then the problem statement.",
