    "Content": "I have a few doubts about Ruled Surfaces. Edit: We're working on ground field $\\Bbb{C}$ The term ruled stands here for birationally ruled Let $S$ be an algebraic smooth surface and $C$ a smooth projective curve. If there is a morphism $p:S\\rightarrow C$ with each fiber birational to $\\Bbb{P}^1$ let's say that $S$ is a rational fibration . By the Noether-Enriques theorem each rational fibration is a ruled surface. Claim: If $S\\neq\\Bbb{P}^2$ then $S$ is a rational fibration if and only if $S$ is ruled. Assume this is true. Then given a ruled surface $S\\neq\\Bbb{P}^2$ we consider $S$ as a rational fibration and there can be at most a finite number of fibers which are birational but not isomorphic to $\\Bbb{P}^1$. So they are singular irreducible curves (right?). Hence by a finite sequence of blow-ups we get a geometrically ruled surface, i.e. a rational fibration with each fiber isomorphic to the line. Is this argument correct? Do you think that claim is true? Edit: Since Asal's answer suggests the claim is false. Let me re-question: suppose $S\\neq\\Bbb{P}^2$ is birationally ruled. Can we show there exists a morphism $p:S\\rightarrow C$ whose generic fiber is isomorphic to $\\Bbb{P}^1$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let me try to answer the modified question. (I assume we are working over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.) The answer to your question depends crucially on what is meant by ruled . (I think this was a source of confusion in the comments.) There are two different defintions I know of, neither one standard: $S$ is geometrically ruled (what Hartshorne calls ruled) if $p: S \\rightarrow C$ has every fibre isomorphic to $\\mathbf{P}^1$; $S$ is birationally ruled (what some other people called ruled) if $S$ is birational to a product $C \\times \\mathbf{P}^1$. Now Noether--Enriques tells you that a rational fibration is birationally ruled (at least once you know there are some smooth fibres, which you get from Bertini's second theorem) but you might worry that there are some singular fibres that stop it from being geometrically ruled. However, this can't actually happen, for the following reason.  By your definition of rational fibration, every fibre of $p$ is an irreducible reduced rational curve, but any such curve which is not isomorphic to $\\mathbf{P}^1$ must be singular, hence have arithmetic genus greater than 0; however, this cannot happen for a flat family such as $p: S \\rightarrow C$. (See Hartshorne for justifications of all these assertions.) So a rational fibration is the same thing as a geometrically ruled surface. Just to be sure that these are really different from the birationally ruled surfaces, let's give an example: take $p: S \\rightarrow C$ a geometrically ruled surface, and let $\\pi: S' \\rightarrow S$ be the blowup of any point on $S$. Then $p \\circ \\pi: S' \\rightarrow C$ is a birationally ruled surface, but one of its fibres is a reducible curve, so it is not geometrically ruled. Actually, this last example also highlights a problem with your idea in the final paragraph: blowing up points unfortunately can't turn a fibration with singular fibres into one with smooth fibres, because it introduces extra components into some of the fibres. I hope this helps. Edit: Finally I think I can answer the intended question. Let $S$ be a birationally ruled surface, not isomorphic to $\\mathbf{P}^2$. Contract $(-1)$-curves on $S$ until we reach a minimal surface $S_m$. So we have a morphism $p: S \\rightarrow S_m$. Now according to Enriques' classification, there are three possibilities for $S_m$: It is a geometrically ruled surface $\\pi: S_m \\rightarrow C$ over a curve of genus $>0$; It is a Hirzebruch surace $\\pi: S_m \\rightarrow \\mathbf{P}^1$; It is $\\mathbf{P}^2$. The first two types are geometrically ruled, so $\\pi \\circ p$ gives a morphism to a curve with generic fibre $\\mathbf{P}^1$. (We get $S$ from $S_m$ by blowing up a finite number of points, so that doesn't affect the generic fibre.) The only problem is if we arrive at $\\mathbf{P}^2$. But in that case we just stop contracting curves at the penultimate step, to get a morphism $p: S \\rightarrow \\Sigma_1$ where $\\Sigma_1$ is the blowup of $\\mathbf{P}^2$ in one point. Now $\\Sigma_1$ is also a geometrically ruled surface, so we can argue as in the other cases. And if that doesn't answer the question, I quit! :)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange about ruled surfaces and rational fibrations. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully to understand the key points and assumptions.\n\nThe user is talking about ruled surfaces and rational fibrations. They mention working over the complex field ℂ. The term \"ruled\" here means birationally ruled. The surface S is algebraic and smooth, and C is a smooth projective curve. There's a morphism p: S → C where each fiber is birational to ℙ¹, and such S is called a rational fibration. They refer to the Noether-Enriques theorem stating that each rational fibration is a ruled surface.\n\nThe main claim they're questioning is: If S ≠ ℙ², then S is a rational fibration if and only if S is ruled. They want to verify if this claim is true. Then, assuming it's true, they argue that on such a ruled surface, there can be at most finitely many fibers that are birational but not isomorphic to ℙ¹, implying those are singular irreducible curves. They propose that by blowing up these points, you can get a geometrically ruled surface (each fiber isomorphic to ℙ¹). They ask if this argument is correct and if the initial claim holds.\n\nIn the edit, they mention that Asal's answer suggests the claim is false. So they re-question: If S ≠ ℙ² is birationally ruled, can we show there exists a morphism p: S → C with generic fiber isomorphic to ℙ¹?\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the given format. The assumptions should list each condition on the objects involved. The problem statement should capture the main question.\n\nFirst, identify all assumptions:\n\n1. The ground field is ℂ.\n2. S is an algebraic smooth surface.\n3. C is a smooth projective curve.\n4. There exists a morphism p: S → C.\n5. Each fiber of p is birational to ℙ¹ (defining a rational fibration).\n6. By Noether-Enriques theorem, each rational fibration is a ruled surface.\n7. The claim: If S ≠ ℙ², then S is a rational fibration if and only if S is ruled.\n8. After considering the claim might be false, the re-question: Suppose S ≠ ℙ² is birationally ruled. Does there exist a morphism p: S → C with generic fiber isomorphic to ℙ¹?\n\nBut wait, the user's problem is first doubting the claim and then adjusting the question after realizing the claim might be false. So the main problem after the edit is whether a birationally ruled surface S (≠ ℙ²) has a morphism p: S → C with generic fiber ℙ¹.\n\nBut the original problem structure needs to separate assumptions and the problem. The user's re-question is the main problem now. So the assumptions would include:\n\n- Working over ℂ.\n- S ≠ ℙ².\n- S is birationally ruled (so it's birational to C × ℙ¹ for some curve C).\n- The task is to show existence of a morphism p: S → C with generic fiber isomorphic to ℙ¹.\n\nBut need to check if all these are in the original question. Let me parse again.\n\nThe original question after edit asks: Suppose S ≠ ℙ² is birationally ruled. Can we show there exists a morphism p: S → C whose generic fiber is isomorphic to ℙ¹?\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. The ground field is ℂ.\n2. S is an algebraic smooth surface.\n3. S is birationally ruled (i.e., birational to C × ℙ¹ for some curve C).\n4. S is not isomorphic to ℙ².\n\nProblem: Show that there exists a morphism p: S → C with generic fiber isomorphic to ℙ¹.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- The ground field is ℂ.\n- S is an algebraic smooth surface.\n- S is birationally ruled.\n- S is not isomorphic to ℙ².\n- C is a smooth projective curve. (Wait, the problem is to show existence of C and p. So perhaps C is not given here. The original question doesn't assume C exists; it's part of the problem to show there's a morphism to some C.)\n\nSo maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The ground field is ℂ.\n- S is an algebraic smooth surface.\n- S is birationally ruled.\n- S is not isomorphic to ℙ².\n\nProblem: Show that there exists a smooth projective curve C and a morphism p: S → C such that the generic fiber of p is isomorphic to ℙ¹.\n\nYes, that seems right. The original question after edit is about birationally ruled surfaces (so S is birationally ruled, S ≠ ℙ²), and the problem is to show existence of such a morphism. So the answer's format should reflect that.",
