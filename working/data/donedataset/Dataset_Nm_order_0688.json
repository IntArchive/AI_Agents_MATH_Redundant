    "Content": "I'm trying to understand a little bit about symplectic geometry, in particular the tautological 1-form on the cotangent bundle. I'm following Ana Canas Da Silva's notes . On page 10 she describes the coordinate free definitions and gives an exercise to find the expression in the local coordinates $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\xi_i dx_i$ . I've tried to do this exercise but can't seem to be able to do it which is really annoying since everywhere I look it is said to be trivial and as a consequence never formally proved.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $(x^i)$ be local coordinates on our base manifold $M$ and let $(x^i, \\xi_j)$ be the induced coordinates on the cotangent bundle $T^* M$. Let $\\pi : T^*M \\to M$ be the projection $(x^i, \\xi_j) \\mapsto (x^i)$. It induces a $C^\\infty (M)$-linear map on $1$-forms, which I will write as $\\pi^* : \\Omega^1 (M) \\to \\Omega^1 (T^* M)$. In coordinates, this sends a $1$-form $\\phi = \\phi_i \\, \\mathrm{d} x^i$ (summation convention) to $(\\phi_i \\circ \\pi) \\, \\mathrm{d} x^i$. As usual this induces a $\\mathbb{R}$-linear map on the fibres, namely $\\pi^*_{(x, \\xi)} : T^*_x M \\to T^*_{(x, \\xi)} (T^* M)$, sending the covector $p$ to the covector $(p, 0)$. (We must be careful and distinguish between covectors and $1$-forms here, to avoid confusion.) The tautological $1$-form on $T^* M$ is defined to be $\\pi^*_{(x, \\xi)} \\xi$ at each point $(x, \\xi)$ in $T^* M$. Why does this formula even make sense? Well, $\\xi$ by definition is an element of $T_x^* M$, so it typechecks. Thus the point $(x, \\xi)$ is mapped to the covector $(\\xi, 0)$ in $T^*_{(x, \\xi)} (T^* M)$, and so the tautological $1$-form in coordinates is given by\n$$\\xi_i \\, \\mathrm{d} x^i$$\nas claimed. (The coefficient of $\\mathrm{d} \\xi_j$ is $0$, of course.) (Perhaps the reason no-one likes writing this out in full is because the tautological nature of the construction makes it quite confusing, unless one keeps track of the types of all the expressions involved.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by carefully reading the original problem.\n\nThe original question is about understanding the tautological 1-form on the cotangent bundle, specifically finding its expression in local coordinates as ∑ξ_i dx_i. The user mentions following Ana Canas Da Silva's notes and getting stuck on the exercise despite it being considered trivial. They also note that most sources state it without proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given earlier had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is then clearly stated.\n\nLooking at the provided example, the assumptions included things like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" For the current problem, the assumptions might relate to the definitions provided in the notes. The key elements here are the tautological 1-form, the cotangent bundle, and the coordinate-free definitions. The exercise is to show that in local coordinates, this form is ∑ξ_i dx_i.\n\nAssumptions should list the necessary conditions or properties. Since the problem is about coordinate expressions, one assumption could be the use of local coordinates (x_i, ξ_i) on the cotangent bundle. Another assumption might be the coordinate-free definition of the tautological 1-form provided in the notes. However, since the user is referring to Da Silva's notes, I might need to infer the standard assumptions. Typically, for such a problem, the main assumption is the coordinate-free definition of the tautological 1-form, perhaps given as α_p = π^* p, where π is the projection from the cotangent bundle to the base manifold. Another assumption is the local coordinates on the cotangent bundle, which are usually (x_i, ξ_i) where x_i are coordinates on the base and ξ_i are the momentum coordinates.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n1. The problem is about the tautological 1-form on the cotangent bundle T*M.\n2. The coordinate-free definition of the tautological 1-form is given (as per the notes).\n3. Local coordinates on T*M are (x_i, ξ_i), where x_i are coordinates on the base manifold M and ξ_i are the fiber coordinates.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line, addressing one property. The problem is to show that in these local coordinates, the tautological 1-form has the expression ∑ξ_i dx_i.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any extra information that's not part of the problem's assumptions. The user's difficulty is with deriving the coordinate expression, so the key assumptions are the definitions and the coordinate system used.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should have assumptions about the tautological 1-form's definition and the local coordinates, then the problem is to find the expression ∑ξ_i dx_i.",
