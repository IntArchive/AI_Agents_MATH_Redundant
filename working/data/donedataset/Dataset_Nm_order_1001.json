    "Content": "I am trying to prove: $A$ compact, $B$ closed $\\Rightarrow A+B = \\{a+b | a\\in A, b\\in B\\}$ closed (exercise in Rudin's Functional Analysis), where $A$ and $B$ are subsets of a topological vector space $X$. In case $X=\\mathbb{R}$ this is easy, using sequences. However, since I was told that using sequences in topology is \"dangerous\" (don't know why though), I am trying to prove this without using sequences (or nets, which I am not familiar with).

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that if A is compact and B is closed in a topological vector space X, then the sum A + B is closed. They mentioned that in ℝ it's easier with sequences, but they want to avoid sequences because they heard it's dangerous in topology. Hmm, right, in general topological spaces, sequences might not capture all limit points unless you have some properties like first-countability. But topological vector spaces are usually Hausdorff and often have countable bases, but maybe not always. So maybe using sequences isn't reliable here.\n\nThe user tried to show that if x is not in A + B, then x is not in the closure of A + B. So they want to show that the complement is open, meaning A + B is closed. Their idea is to assume x is in the closure of A + B and get a contradiction with A being compact. Let me think. If x is in the closure, then every neighborhood of x intersects A + B. Since A is compact, maybe we can use some covering or the compactness to extract a convergent subnet or something. But the user isn't familiar with nets. So perhaps using only open covers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that in topological vector spaces, the addition operation is continuous. So since A is compact and B is closed, maybe A + B is the image of A × B under addition, but wait, addition is continuous, but the image of a compact set under a continuous function is compact only if the function is continuous and the space is Hausdorff. Wait, but compact sets in Hausdorff spaces are closed. But here B is already closed, not necessarily compact. Hmm.\n\nWait, the sum of a compact set and a closed set. Let me recall some theorems. In a Hausdorff topological vector space, compact sets are closed. So A is compact, hence closed. Then B is closed. But the sum of two closed sets isn't necessarily closed. For example, in ℝ, if you take A = {n + 1/n | n ∈ ℕ} and B = {-n | n ∈ ℕ}, both closed, but A + B might not be closed. Wait, but in this specific case, maybe the compactness of A helps.\n\nWait, actually in the problem, A is compact and B is closed. Let's think about the standard proof in ℝ. If you have a sequence a_n + b_n converging to x, then since A is compact, a_n has a convergent subsequence a_{n_k} → a in A. Then b_{n_k} = x_{n_k} - a_{n_k} converges to x - a. Since B is closed, x - a ∈ B, so x = a + (x - a) ∈ A + B. Hence A + B is closed. But this uses sequences, which might require the space to be first-countable.\n\nBut the user wants to avoid sequences. So how else can we approach this? Let's think about the closure. Suppose x is in the closure of A + B. We need to show x is in A + B. Since X is a topological vector space, the addition map is continuous. So the set A + B is the image of A × B under addition. But even if A is compact and B is closed, A × B is closed in X × X? Not necessarily. The product of a compact and closed set is closed if the space is Hausdorff? Wait, in general, if A is compact and B is closed, then A × B is closed in X × X. Because compact sets in Hausdorff spaces are closed, and the product of closed sets is closed. So A × B is closed. But addition is a continuous map, so the image of a closed set under a continuous map isn't necessarily closed. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, since A is compact, maybe we can use the fact that the map adding A to B: for each a ∈ A, consider the translate B + a. Since B is closed, each B + a is closed. Then the union over all a ∈ A of B + a is A + B. But the union of closed sets isn't necessarily closed unless it's a finite union. So that might not help.\n\nWait, here's an idea. If we can show that A + B is closed by showing that its complement is open. Take x not in A + B. Then for every a ∈ A, x - a is not in B. Since B is closed, for each a ∈ A, there exists an open neighborhood U_a of x - a that doesn't intersect B. Then, because subtraction is continuous, for each a, there exists an open neighborhood V_a of a such that x - V_a is contained in U_a. So x - V_a doesn't intersect B, meaning that V_a + x doesn't intersect B + x? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since x - a is not in B, and B is closed, there exists an open set U_a containing x - a such that U_a ∩ B = ∅. Then, the preimage of U_a under the map y ↦ x - y is open. That would be the set { y | x - y ∈ U_a } = x - U_a. So x - U_a is an open neighborhood of a. Since A is compact, we can cover A with finitely many such neighborhoods x - U_{a1}, ..., x - U_{an}. Then the intersection of the corresponding U_{a_i} would be an open set around x - A that doesn't intersect B. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, for each a ∈ A, x - a ∉ B. Since B is closed, and the space is a topological vector space, which is regular (since it's Hausdorff and has uniform structure), there exists an open neighborhood W_a of x - a such that W_a ∩ B = ∅. Then, the set x - W_a is an open neighborhood of a. Since A is compact, the open cover {x - W_a}_{a∈A} has a finite subcover. So there exist a1, ..., an such that A ⊆ ∪_{i=1}^n (x - W_{a_i}). Then, let W = ∩_{i=1}^n W_{a_i}. W is an open neighborhood of x - A? Wait, maybe not. Let me see. Each W_{a_i} is a neighborhood of x - a_i. So x - W_{a_i} is a neighborhood of a_i. So A is covered by x - W_{a_i}, meaning that for each a ∈ A, a ∈ x - W_{a_i} for some i, so x - a ∈ W_{a_i}. Therefore, for each a ∈ A, x - a is in ∪_{i=1}^n W_{a_i}. But we want to find a neighborhood around x that doesn't intersect A + B. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nIf we set W = ∩_{i=1}^n W_{a_i}, then W is an open neighborhood of x - a_i for each i? Not exactly, because W_{a_i} is a neighborhood of x - a_i, but taking intersection might not cover all x - A. Maybe instead, consider that A is covered by the sets x - W_{a_i}, so for any a ∈ A, there exists some i such that a ∈ x - W_{a_i}, which implies x - a ∈ W_{a_i}. But W_{a_i} are chosen so that W_{a_i} ∩ B = ∅. Therefore, x - a ∈ W_{a_i} implies that a = x - (x - a) ∈ x - W_{a_i}, but I think this is getting tangled.\n\nAlternatively, consider the set x - B. Since B is closed, x - B is closed. Then, A and x - B are disjoint? Because if there exists a ∈ A such that a ∈ x - B, then a = x - b for some b ∈ B, which implies x = a + b ∈ A + B, contradicting x ∉ A + B. So A and x - B are disjoint. Since A is compact and x - B is closed, and in a topological vector space (which is Hausdorff), we can separate A and x - B with disjoint open sets. So there exists an open set U containing A and an open set V containing x - B such that U ∩ V = ∅. Then, because addition is continuous, the set U + B is open? Wait, no. In topological vector spaces, addition is continuous but not necessarily open. However, scalar multiplication and addition are continuous. Maybe we can use the open set U to create a neighborhood around x.\n\nWait, since U is an open set containing A, and the space is a topological vector space, for each a ∈ A, there exists an open neighborhood U_a of 0 such that a + U_a ⊆ U. Because translation is a homeomorphism. Then, using compactness of A, cover A with finitely many a_i + U_{a_i}. But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, since U is an open set containing A, and V is an open set containing x - B, and U ∩ V = ∅, then (U + B) and (V + x) are disjoint? Let's see. If there's a point in both, then u + b = v + x for some u ∈ U, b ∈ B, v ∈ V. But then u = v + x - b. Since v ∈ V and x - b ∈ x - B, which is in V. Wait, V contains x - B, so x - b ∈ V for all b ∈ B. So v + x - b would be in V + x - b? This seems messy.\n\nWait, maybe we can look at the complement of A + B. Take x ∉ A + B. Then, as above, A and x - B are disjoint. Since A is compact and x - B is closed, by the separation theorem in topological vector spaces (which are locally convex?), we can find a continuous linear functional that separates A and x - B. But maybe that's using too much machinery.\n\nAlternatively, in topological vector spaces, the difference set A - x + B is closed? Not sure. Maybe another approach. Since A is compact, and B is closed, consider the projection map π: X × X → X defined by π(a,b) = a + b. The set A × B is closed in X × X because A is compact (hence closed) and B is closed. Then, the image of A × B under π is A + B. But continuous images of closed sets aren't necessarily closed. However, if the map π is closed when restricted to A × B, then A + B would be closed. But is π a closed map when restricted to A × B? Since A is compact, the projection map from A × X to X is closed. Wait, the projection from A × X to X is closed if A is compact. Yes, that's a theorem in topology: if you have a product space and one factor is compact, the projection onto the other factor is closed. So here, A is compact, and we're looking at the projection of A × B onto X via addition. But addition is a continuous map, but how does that relate to projection?\n\nWait, maybe think of addition as the map +: X × X → X. Then A + B is the image of A × B under +. If A is compact and B is closed, then A × B is a closed subset of X × X (since A is compact, hence closed, and B is closed, so the product is closed). The image under a continuous map of a closed set isn't necessarily closed, but maybe since A is compact, and the map is continuous, the image is compact? No, because B is not compact. So A × B is closed, but not necessarily compact. Unless B is also compact, but B is only closed.\n\nWait, but even if A is compact, B is closed, then A × B is closed in X × X, but the image under addition is A + B. So maybe the image is closed? Not necessarily. For example, take A = {0} compact and B a closed set. Then A + B = B, which is closed. But that's trivial. If A is compact and B is closed, maybe in general A + B is closed. But the user is trying to prove that.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach using nets. Even though the user isn't familiar with nets, maybe the proof can be translated. Since in general topology, closure can be characterized by nets. If x is in the closure of A + B, then there exists a net (a_i + b_i) converging to x, where a_i ∈ A and b_i ∈ B. Since A is compact, the net a_i has a convergent subnet a_{i_j} → a ∈ A. Then, b_{i_j} = x_{i_j} - a_{i_j} converges to x - a. Since B is closed, x - a ∈ B, so x = a + (x - a) ∈ A + B. Hence, A + B is closed. But this uses nets, which the user wanted to avoid.\n\nBut since the problem is from Rudin's Functional Analysis, which might assume nets or filters. However, the user wants to avoid both sequences and nets. So perhaps another way.\n\nAnother idea: In a topological vector space, if A is compact and B is closed, then A + B is closed. To show this, take x ∈ closure(A + B). Then, every neighborhood of x intersects A + B. We need to show x ∈ A + B. Consider the set x - B. Since B is closed, x - B is closed. Now, x ∈ closure(A + B) implies that for any neighborhood U of 0, (x - U) intersects A + B. So there exists a ∈ A, b ∈ B such that a + b ∈ x - U. So a ∈ x - b - U. Since this is true for any U, the set x - B is in the closure of A. But A is compact, hence closed, so closure of A is A itself. Therefore, x - B ⊆ A. Hence, x ∈ A + B.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If x ∈ closure(A + B), then for any neighborhood U of 0, there exists a ∈ A, b ∈ B such that a + b ∈ x + U. Therefore, a ∈ x + U - b. So for each U, there exists b ∈ B such that a ∈ x + U - b. But how does this imply x - B is in the closure of A? Maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since x is in the closure of A + B, for any neighborhood U of 0, there exist a_U ∈ A and b_U ∈ B such that a_U + b_U ∈ x + U. Since A is compact, the net {a_U} (indexed by neighborhoods U) has a convergent subnet converging to some a ∈ A. Then, b_U = (x + U) - a_U. As U becomes smaller, the subnet a_{U_i} → a, so b_{U_i} = x + U_i - a_{U_i} → x - a. Since B is closed, x - a ∈ B, so x = a + (x - a) ∈ A + B. Hence, x ∈ A + B. But this again uses nets.\n\nSo maybe the answer is that you can't really avoid using some form of convergence, be it sequences or nets, but in general topological spaces, nets are necessary. Since the user is working in a topological vector space, which may not be first-countable, sequences might not suffice, so nets are needed. However, the problem is from Rudin's book, which might use nets. But the user asked for a proof without sequences or nets. Is there a way?\n\nLet me recall that in topological groups (which topological vector spaces are), the sum of a compact set and a closed set is closed. The standard proof uses nets, but maybe there's a way using covers. Suppose x ∉ A + B. We need to find a neighborhood of x disjoint from A + B. Since A is compact and x - B is closed, and A and x - B are disjoint (because x ∉ A + B), then since the space is a topological vector space (which is regular), for each a ∈ A, there exist disjoint open sets U_a and V_a such that a ∈ U_a and x - B ⊆ V_a. By compactness of A, cover A with finitely many U_{a_i}. Let U = ∪U_{a_i} and V = ∩V_{a_i}. Then U is an open set containing A, V is an open set containing x - B, and U and V are disjoint. Then, consider the neighborhood W = x - V. W is open and contains B. Then, U + W is an open set containing A + B. If we can show that x ∉ U + W, then X \\ (U + W) is a closed set containing x, hence x is not in the closure of A + B. Let me verify. Suppose x ∈ U + W. Then x = u + w for some u ∈ U and w ∈ W. But W = x - V, so w = x - v for some v ∈ V. Then x = u + x - v ⇒ u = v. But u ∈ U and v ∈ V, which are disjoint. Contradiction. Hence, x ∉ U + W, so U + W is an open set containing A + B and not containing x. Therefore, x is not in the closure of A + B, so A + B is closed.\n\nYes, this seems to work without sequences or nets. The key steps are using regularity of the space to separate A and x - B with open sets, using compactness to get a finite cover, then constructing the neighborhood W around B such that x is not in U + W. This approach uses open covers and the properties of topological vector spaces being regular and Hausdorff.\n\nSo the final answer would involve structuring the problem by listing the assumptions: A is compact, B is closed, both subsets of a topological vector space, and the problem is to prove A + B is closed. Then the solution uses the open cover argument to separate A and x - B, constructs the open sets U and V, then W, leading to a contradiction if x were in the closure of A + B.",
