    "Content": "I am studying the proof that $\\sqrt 2$ is an irrational number. Now I understand most of the proof, but I lack an understanding of the main idea  which is: We assume $\\frac{m^2}{n^2} = 2$ . Then both $m$ and $n$ can't be even. I do not understand, why can't both $m$ and $n$ be even?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "we can assume that $$\\gcd(m,n)=1$$ and $$2=\\frac{m^2}{n^2}$$ then $$2n^2=m^2$$ thus the left-hand side is even and so $$m^2$$ this is a contradiction, both numbers $m,n$ can not be even",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about the classic proof that the square root of 2 is irrational. Specifically, they're confused about why, in the proof by contradiction, we assume that m and n are in lowest terms (i.e., that they can't both be even). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the standard proof. The proof starts by assuming that √2 is rational, so it can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in simplest form). Then by squaring both sides, we get m² = 2n², which implies that m² is even, so m must be even. Then substituting m = 2k into the equation gives 4k² = 2n², so n² = 2k², which means n² is even, hence n is even. But if both m and n are even, they share a common factor of 2, contradicting the initial assumption that they have no common factors. Therefore, the original assumption that √2 is rational must be false.\n\nThe user's confusion is: why can't both m and n be even? From the proof's structure, if they were both even, then the fraction m/n wasn't in lowest terms. But the user might not see why that's a problem. Maybe they think, \"So what if they are both even? Can't we just divide numerator and denominator by 2 and get a new fraction?\" But the key point is that in the initial assumption, we did take m and n to be coprime (no common factors). If both were even, that would violate the coprimality, hence leading to a contradiction.\n\nSo the problem here is understanding the structure of the proof by contradiction. The user might not grasp that the contradiction arises from the fact that if m and n are both even, then the fraction could be simplified further, which contradicts the assumption that it was already in simplest terms. Therefore, the problem is about explaining why the initial assumption (that m and n are coprime) leads to the conclusion that they can't both be even, hence creating the contradiction.\n\nNow, to structure the problem according to the given format. The original question is asking about why both m and n can't be even in the proof. The key assumptions here are the ones used in the proof by contradiction. \n\nThe problem statement, when formatted, should list the assumptions and the actual problem. The assumptions here would include that m and n are integers, that they are coprime (no common factors), and that their ratio squared equals 2. The problem is then to understand why both m and n can't be even given these assumptions.\n\nLooking back at the example provided, the user structured the problem by listing each assumption line by line. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- m and n are integers,\n- m and n are coprime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1),\n- (m/n)² = 2.\n\nThe problem then is: Prove that both m and n cannot be even.\n\nBut wait, the original question is phrased as a confusion about the step in the proof. So perhaps the problem should be restated as: \"In the proof that √2 is irrational, why can't both m and n be even when assuming m/n is in lowest terms and (m/n)² = 2?\"\n\nBut following the example's structure, where the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was restated as proving A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the original problem is to explain why both m and n can't be even in the proof. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- m and n are integers,\n- m and n are coprime (i.e., in lowest terms),\n- (m/n)² = 2.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove that both m and n cannot be even.\n\nBut the user's question is phrased as not understanding why both can't be even. So the problem statement would be the user's question, but structured into the given format.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nm and n are integers,\nm and n are coprime,\n(m/n)^2 = 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that both m and n cannot be even.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem as presented by the user is more about the step in the proof, so maybe the problem statement is: \"In the proof that √2 is irrational, why can't both m and n be even when assuming they are coprime and (m/n)² = 2?\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is phrased as a directive: \"Prove that...\". So following that example, it's better to structure it as a problem to prove that both can't be even given the assumptions.\n\nHence, the final formatted problem would be as above.",
