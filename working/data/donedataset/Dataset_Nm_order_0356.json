    "AcceptedAnswer": "We can show that if\n$$\nf^{(n)} \\ge 0\\qquad{\\rm(1)}\n$$\neverywhere, for each integer $n >0$, and $f(x)=e^x$ on at least four points of $\\mathbb R$, then $f(x)=e^x$ everywhere. This will make use of Bernstein's theorem . I feel that there must be a more elementary proof though. I'll start with the simpler case where (1) holds for all $n\\ge0$, in which case it is only necessary to suppose that $f(x)=e^x$ at three points. As $\\left(-\\frac{d}{dx}\\right)^nf(-x)=f^{(n)}(-x)\\ge0$, by definition $f(-x)$ is completely monotonic. Bernstein's theorem means that we can write\n$$\nf(-x)=\\int e^{-xy}\\,\\mu(dy)\\qquad {\\rm(2)}\n$$\nfor some finite measure $\\mu$ on $[0,\\infty)$ and for all $x > 0$. By inversion of Laplace transforms, $\\mu$ is uniquely defined. In fact, the statement (2) applies for all $x\\in\\mathbb R$ and we can argue as follows -- Applying the same argument to $f(K-x)$, for any fixed real $K$ extends (2) to all $x-K > 0$ and, letting $K$ go to $-\\infty$, to all $x\\in\\mathbb R$. Changing the sign of $x$, for convenience,\n$$\nf(x)=\\int e^{xy}\\,\\mu(dy).\n$$\nSee also, this answer on MathOverflow (and the comments). Suppose that $\\mu$ has nonzero weight outside of the set $\\{1\\}$. Multiplying by $e^{-x}$ and taking second derivatives\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d}{dx}\\right)^2e^{-x}f(x)=\\left(\\frac{d}{dx}\\right)^2\\int e^{x(y-1)}\\mu(dy)=\\int(y-1)^2e^{x(y-1)}\\mu(dy) > 0.\n$$\nThis means that $e^{-x}f(x)$ is strictly convex, contradicting the fact that it is equal to 1 at more than two points of $\\mathbb R$. So, $\\mu$ has zero weight outside of $\\{1\\}$ and $e^{-x}f(x)=\\mu(\\{1\\})$ is constant. I'll now return to the case where (1) holds for $n > 0$ and $f(x)=e^x$ on a set $S\\subseteq\\mathbb R$ of size four. By the mean value theorem, $f^\\prime(x)=e^x$ holds for at least one point between any two points of $S$ and, hence, holds for at least three points of $\\mathbb R$. So, using the proof above, $f^\\prime(x)=e^x$ everywhere. Integrating, $f(x)=e^x+c$ for a constant $c$. Then, in order that $f(x)=e^x$ anywhere, $c$ must be zero.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The original question is from Math Stack Exchange titled \"From $e^n$ to $e^x$\". \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The problem states that we need to find a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that $f(n) = e^n$ for all natural numbers $n$ (where $\\mathbb{N}$ includes 0). The second condition is that all its derivatives of positive integer order $y$ (i.e., $f^{(y)}(x)$) are positive for every real number $x$ and every $y \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$ (which is {1,2,3,...}).\n\nThe user also mentions that the problem isn't about fractional calculus and suggests using Sard's Theorem and Pre-image Theorem, but those might be part of their own thoughts rather than part of the problem statement. The core problem is to prove that the unique solution is $f(x) = e^x$.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. The function $f$ maps from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2. For every natural number $n$ (including 0), $f(n) = e^n$.\n3. For every positive integer $y$ (derivative order) and every real number $x$, the $y$-th derivative of $f$ at $x$ is positive.\n\nI need to list each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove uniqueness and existence of the solution, which is $e^x$.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"solve for $f$\" such that those conditions hold, and then asks to prove that the unique solution is $e^x$. So the problem statement is to show that $f(x) = e^x$ is the only function satisfying those conditions.\n\nI should check if there are more assumptions. The function's domain and codomain are specified as $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. The condition on the derivatives applies for all positive integers $y$ and all real $x$. The function must agree with the exponential function at all natural numbers. \n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n- For all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $f(n) = e^n$.\n- For all $y \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$ and all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f^{(y)}(x) > 0$.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the unique solution is $f(x) = e^x$.\n\nI need to structure these into the specified format. Let me make sure each assumption is a single line, one object per condition. So the three points above are the assumptions. The problem is the statement to prove uniqueness and existence of $e^x$ as the solution.",
