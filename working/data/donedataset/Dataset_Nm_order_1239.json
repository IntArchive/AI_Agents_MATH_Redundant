    "Content": "Context: I'm trying to algebraically prove that an open interval is an open set . If I sketch it, as suggested by @rschwieb in this answer , then it seems quite obvious that this is indeed true. But I would like to be able to show it algebraically and after having looked at various sources found on the internet, I have decided to ask it here. Attempt: For definiteness, let us consider: \\begin{equation}\n(c,d) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid c < x < d \\}\n\\end{equation} Furthermore, let $a \\in (c,d)$ , and recall that the $\\epsilon$ -neighborhood of $a$ is the set: \\begin{equation}\nV_\\epsilon (a) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid |x-a| < \\epsilon \\} \n\\end{equation} Now, if we take $\\epsilon = \\mathrm{min} \\{ a-c,d-a \\}$ , then $a-\\epsilon \\geq c$ and $a+\\epsilon \\leq d$ . Up until here I understand everything. But then I don't understand how we can conclude that $V_\\epsilon (a) \\subseteq (c,d)$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Choose $\\epsilon \\lt \\mathrm{min} \\{ a-c,d-a \\}$. Picture it geometrically by drawing a real line. $ |x - a| \\lt \\epsilon $ represents all points on the line that are $\\epsilon$-distant from the point $a$. By picking $\\epsilon \\lt \\mathrm{min} \\{ a-c,d-a \\}$ what you do is to pick the smallest distance from the point $c$ to the boundaries of the interval. Now if we create a neighbourhood (an open set) around $c$ again using this minimum distance it will clearly be contained in the original interval. Rigorously, $x \\in V_{\\epsilon}(a) \\implies |x - a| \\lt \\epsilon \\iff a - \\epsilon\\lt x \\lt a + \\epsilon \\tag{1}$ Now $\\epsilon \\le a-c $ and $\\epsilon \\le d - a$. Use these to approximate $\\epsilon$ in $(1)$. That is, $$ c=a - (a - c) \\lt a - \\epsilon\\lt x \\lt a + \\epsilon \\lt a + (d - a) = d \\iff x \\in (c,d) \\implies V_{\\epsilon}(a) \\subseteq (c, d)$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. So I need to parse the original question, filter out unnecessary information, and list each assumption clearly.\n\nThe original question is about proving that an open interval is an open set. The user's attempt mentions considering an open interval (c, d), taking a point a in that interval, and defining an epsilon neighborhood around a with epsilon as the minimum of (a - c, d - a). They then don't understand how this leads to V_epsilon(a) being a subset of (c, d).\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem is set in real numbers. The interval (c, d) is defined as all x where c < x < d. Then there's a point a in (c, d). The epsilon is chosen as the minimum of a - c and d - a. The conclusion needed is that the epsilon neighborhood around a is within (c, d).\n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. So the interval is an open interval (c, d), which is a subset of real numbers. The point a is an element of this interval. Epsilon is defined as the minimum of two distances. Each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nProblem statement: Show that V_epsilon(a) is a subset of (c, d). But in the original question, the user is trying to prove the open interval is an open set, so maybe the problem here is to show that (c, d) is open by demonstrating that for any a in (c, d), there's an epsilon neighborhood around a contained in (c, d). So the exact problem statement here is to prove that V_epsilon(a) is a subset of (c, d).\n\nWait, but the original title is \"Showing that an open interval is an open set\". The problem as presented in the user's attempt is about concluding V_epsilon(a) subset of (c, d). So maybe the formatted problem should be \"Prove that an open interval (c, d) is an open set by showing that for any a ∈ (c, d), there exists ε > 0 such that V_ε(a) ⊆ (c, d).\" But the user's specific confusion is about the last step: how taking ε = min{a - c, d - a} leads to V_epsilon(a) being a subset. So perhaps in the problem statement, after defining ε, the problem is to show that this choice of ε works, i.e., V_epsilon(a) ⊆ (c, d).\n\nBut according to the example given, the problem part is the main question. The original problem's task is to prove the open interval is an open set. But in the user's attempt, they are stuck on concluding V_epsilon subset. So maybe the formatted problem should be \"Prove that V_epsilon(a) is a subset of (c, d) with ε = min{a - c, d - a}.\"\n\nBut let's check the original question again. The user writes: \"But I would like to be able to show it algebraically...\" The \"it\" refers to proving the open interval is an open set. Their attempt is up to choosing epsilon, and they don't see how to conclude the neighborhood is a subset. So the problem here is specifically about that step. Therefore, the problem statement should be: \"Show that V_epsilon(a) ⊆ (c, d) when ε = min{a − c, d − a}.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- (c, d) is an open interval in ℝ, defined as {x ∈ ℝ | c < x < d}.\n\n- a is an element of (c, d).\n\n- ε is defined as min{a − c, d − a}.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to show that the epsilon neighborhood is a subset of the interval.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me make sure each assumption is one line, one condition. The first assumption is about the interval. Second is a being in the interval. Third is the definition of epsilon. Then the problem is to show the inclusion.",
