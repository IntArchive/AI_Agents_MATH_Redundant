    "Content": "Consider the sequence defined as $x_1 = 1$ $x_{n+1} = \\sin x_n$ I think I was able to show that the sequence $\\sqrt{n} x_{n}$ converges to $\\sqrt{3}$ by a tedious elementary method which I wasn't too happy about. (I think I did this by showing that $\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{n+1}} < x_{n} < \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{n}}$, don't remember exactly) This looks like it should be a standard problem. Does anyone know a simple (and preferably elementary) proof for the fact that the sequence $\\sqrt{n}x_{n}$ converges to $\\sqrt{3}$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Before getting into the details, let me say: The ideas I'm talking about, including this exact example, can be found in chapter 8 of Asymptotic Methods in Analysis (second edition), by N. G. de Bruijn. This is a really superb book, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to approximate quantities in \"calculus-like\" settings. (If you want to do approximation in combinatorial settings, I recommend Chapter 9 of Concrete Mathematics .) Also, this isn't just about $\\sin$. Let $f$ be a function with $f(0)=0$ and $0 \\leq f(u) < u$ for $u$ in $(0,c]$ then the sequence $x_n:=f(f(f(\\cdots f(c)\\cdots)$ approaches $0$. If $f(u)=u-a u^{k+1} + O(u^{k+2})$ (with $a>0$) then $x_n \\approx \\alpha n^{-1/k}$ and you can prove that by the same methods here. Having said that, the answer to your question. On $[0,1]$, we have\n$$\\sin x=x-x^3/6+O(x^5).$$\nSetting $y_n=1/x_n^2$, we have\n$$1/x_{n+1}^2 = x_n^{-2} \\left(1-x_n^2/6+O(x_n^4) \\right)^{-2} =  1/x_n^2 + 1/3 + O(x_n^2)$$\nso\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + 1/3 + O(y_n^{-1}).$$ We see that\n$$y_n = \\frac{n}{3} + O\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n y_k^{-1} \\right)$$\nand\n$$\\frac{1}{n}y_n = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{n} O\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n y_k^{-1} \\right)$$\nSince we already know that $x_n \\to 0$, we know that $y_n^{-1} \\to 0$, so the average goes to zero and we get $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} y_n/n=1/3$. Transforming back to $\\sqrt{n} x_n$ now follows by the continuity of $1/\\sqrt{t}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original title is \"Convergence of √n xₙ where xₙ₊₁ = sin(xₙ)\". The question describes a sequence defined by x₁ = 1 and xₙ₊₁ = sin(xₙ). The user mentions they tried showing that √n xₙ converges to √3 using a tedious method involving inequalities √(3/(n+1)) < xₙ < √(3/n). They are asking for a simpler, preferably elementary proof.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n1. The sequence is defined with x₁ = 1.\n2. Each subsequent term is xₙ₊₁ = sin(xₙ).\n3. The problem is about the convergence of √n xₙ.\n4. The limit to prove is √3.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which the user included. Here, the problem's assumptions are the definition of the sequence. So each step in the definition and any given conditions need to be split into separate assumptions.\n\nSo step by step:\n\nFirst assumption: x₁ is defined as 1. That's one condition on the initial term.\n\nSecond assumption: For all n, xₙ₊₁ is equal to sin(xₙ). That's the recursive definition.\n\nThird assumption: The problem considers the sequence √n multiplied by xₙ. So the object here is the sequence √n xₙ.\n\nFourth, the problem is to show this sequence converges to √3. Wait, but the problem statement as given by the user is \"prove that the sequence √n xₙ converges to √3\". So the problem is already structured. But maybe in the assumptions, we need to include that the limit is √3? No, the limit is the thing to prove, so that's part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the example given had the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", so the problem is to prove that. Here, the problem is to prove that the sequence √n xₙ converges to √3. So in the assumptions, we list the conditions given in the problem. The example listed the initial conditions as assumptions. So here, the initial condition is x₁ = 1, and the recursive formula xₙ₊₁ = sin(xₙ). So those are two separate assumptions. Then, the problem is about the sequence √n xₙ. So maybe the third assumption is that the sequence in question is √n xₙ? Wait, but the problem is about that sequence. Hmm. Maybe in the problem statement, it's just the problem, and the assumptions are the given conditions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted assumption, they included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error? Wait, looking back: the user's example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That's a mistake. So maybe the user made an error in their example. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list all given conditions in the problem as assumptions, without adding extra ones. In the original example, the problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, so that was an incorrect assumption. Therefore, I need to be careful here.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states that the sequence is defined by x₁ = 1 and xₙ₊₁ = sin(xₙ). So those are the given conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. x₁ = 1.\n2. For each n ≥ 1, xₙ₊₁ = sin(xₙ).\n3. The problem is about the sequence √n xₙ.\n\nWait, but the third point is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The problem is to prove that this sequence converges to √3. Therefore, in the assumptions, we only list the given conditions. The problem statement is to prove that the sequence √n xₙ converges to √3.\n\nSo the correct assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx₁ = 1,\nFor all n ≥ 1, xₙ₊₁ = sin(xₙ).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence √n xₙ converges to √3.\n\nBut wait, the user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user's example was flawed. Therefore, in the current problem, we should list the initial conditions as assumptions. The problem statement is about the convergence of √n xₙ to √3.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx₁ = 1,\nFor each n ≥ 1, xₙ₊₁ = sin(xₙ).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence √n xₙ converges to √3.\n\nBut the original user's question also mentions that they had shown √(3/(n+1)) < xₙ < √(3/n). However, that is part of their attempt, not the problem's given conditions. Therefore, we shouldn't include that in the assumptions. The problem is to prove the convergence, given the recursive definition. So the assumptions are just the definition of the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be structured as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nx₁ = 1,\nFor each n ≥ 1, xₙ₊₁ = sin(xₙ).\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence √n xₙ converges to √3.\n###",
