    "Content": "This is an exercise for the book Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote\n(pg. 530): Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $\\neq2$ . Let $a,b\\in F$ with $b$\n  not a square in $F$. Prove $\\sqrt{a+\\sqrt{b}}=\\sqrt{m}+\\sqrt{n}$ for\n  some $m,n\\in F$ iff $a^{2}-b$ is a square in $F$. I am having problem proving this claim, I tried to assume $\\sqrt{a+\\sqrt{b}}=\\sqrt{m}+\\sqrt{n}$\nand I naturally squared both sides, to try and get $a^{2}$ I squared\nboth sides again and then reduced $2b$ from both sides and rearranged\nto get $$a^{2}-b=(m+n+2\\sqrt{mn})^{2}-2\\sqrt{b}(a+\\sqrt{b})$$ but\nI don't see how I can use it. Can someone please help me prove this claim ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$$\\sqrt{a+\\sqrt b}=\\sqrt m + \\sqrt n \\Rightarrow a+\\sqrt b = m+n+2\\sqrt{mn}$$\nSince $\\phi(\\alpha+\\beta\\sqrt b)=\\alpha-\\beta\\sqrt b$ for $\\alpha,\\beta\\in F$ defines an automorphism $\\phi\\colon F[\\sqrt b]\\to F[\\sqrt b]$ that leaves $F$ fixed, we have that $\\phi(\\sqrt{mn})= \\pm\\sqrt{mn}$ because $\\phi$ maps the polynomial $X^2-mn$ to itself and can at most interchange its roots.\nThus we additionally get $a-\\sqrt b=\\phi(a+\\sqrt b)=\\phi(m+n+2\\sqrt{mn})$, i.e.\n$$a-\\sqrt b=m+n\\pm2\\sqrt{mn}.$$\nSince $\\sqrt b\\ne -\\sqrt b$ (characteristic $\\ne 2$), the left hand sides differ, hence so do the right hand soides, hence \"$\\pm$\" is really \"$-$\". By adding and subtracting these equations we find that $a=m+n$ and $\\sqrt b =2\\sqrt{mn}$.\nHence $m,n$ are roots of $0=X^2-(m+n)X+mn=X^2-a X+\\frac b4$ and can be found as \n$$\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-b}}2$$\nMore precisely: If $a^2-b$ is a square, this actually produces $m,n\\in F$ with the property that $(\\sqrt m +\\sqrt n)^2=a+\\sqrt b$, i.e. $\\sqrt m + \\sqrt n$ is a root of $X^2-(a+\\sqrt b)$ as desired. If $a^2-b$ is not a square, no solutions for $m,n$ exist in $F$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is about proving that the equality √(a + √b) = √m + √n holds if and only if a² - b is a square in the field F. The user mentions that F is a field of characteristic not equal to 2, and a, b are elements of F with b not being a square in F. The problem is from Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra, page 530.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states:\n\n- F is a field with characteristic ≠ 2.\n- a, b are elements of F.\n- b is not a square in F.\n- The problem is to prove that √(a + √b) can be expressed as √m + √n for some m, n in F if and only if a² - b is a square in F.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. F is a field.\n2. The characteristic of F is not 2.\n3. a is an element of F.\n4. b is an element of F.\n5. b is not a square in F.\n\nEach assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's check each point:\n\n1. \"F is a field\" – that's one condition about F.\n2. \"The characteristic of F is not 2\" – another separate condition about F.\n3. \"a is an element of F\" – separate for a.\n4. \"b is an element of F\" – separate for b.\n5. \"b is not a square in F\" – a condition about b.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to prove the equivalence: √(a + √b) = √m + √n for some m, n in F if and only if a² - b is a square in F.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"iff a² - b is a square in F\". So that's the main problem.\n\nI need to make sure that in the assumptions, all the given conditions are listed. The problem mentions that the field has characteristic ≠ 2, which is important because in characteristic 2, squaring behaves differently, and square roots may not be unique or may have different properties. Also, b is not a square in F, which is crucial because otherwise, if b were a square, then √b is already in F, and the expression simplifies differently.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\n- F is a field,\n- F has characteristic not equal to 2,\n- a is an element of F,\n- b is an element of F,\n- b is not a square in F.\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove that √(a + √b) can be written as √m + √n for some m, n ∈ F if and only if a² - b is a square in F.\n\nI need to check if I missed any conditions. The original problem didn't state anything else. The user tried squaring both sides and got to an equation but couldn't proceed. The key here is structuring the problem correctly.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list each assumption line by line, then state the problem.",
