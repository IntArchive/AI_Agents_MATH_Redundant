    "Content": "I recently came onto a set of numbers with an interesting pattern, but I can't prove it always holds true. I'd appreciate any help in figuring it out. Let the set $S$ $$S = \\left \\{ \\frac{1}{q^2+1} , q \\in \\mathbb{Q^+} \\right \\}$$ And three elements of that set $a,b,c \\in S$ My conjecture is that if their average is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ , then at least one of them must be equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ . $$\\frac{a+b+c}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies (a =\\frac{1}{2}) \\lor (b=\\frac{1}{2}) \\lor (c=\\frac{1}{2})$$ Do you have any idea on how to prove, or disprove that claim? Edit to provide examples :\nYou can easily generate sets of numbers that verify the conjectured pattern. Let $f(q) = \\frac{1}{q^2+1}$ for rational $q$ . All triplets of the form $(f(1), f(q), f(\\frac{1}{q}))$ have an average of $\\frac{1}{2}$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Unfortunately, the postulated conjecture is not true: Indeed, examples of admissible $q$ -triples that disprove the statement are $$\n(\\tfrac{3}{2}, \\tfrac{2}{9},\\tfrac{41}{23})\\\\\n(\\tfrac{9}{2}, \\tfrac{2}{3},\\tfrac{23}{41})\n$$ I found those numbers by just brute force looking for them. I did this by iterating through rational numbers $a,b$ , then I calculate $c$ such that $f(a)+f(b)+f(c)=\\tfrac{3}{2}$ and then check if $c$ is rational. Please have a look at the following Maple code restart:\n\nf:=x->1/(1+x^2);\n\nN:=10;\n\nfor p1 from 2 to N do\n  for q1 from 1 to p1-1 do\n    for p2 from 1 to N do\n      for q2 from p2+1 to N do\n        \n        a:=p1/q1;\n        b:=p2/q2;\n        R:=3/2-f(a)-f(b);\n        c:=sqrt(1/R-1);\n\n        if( type(c, rational) and R<>1/2 ) then \n          print(a,b,c,f(a),f(b),f(c),f(a)+f(b)+f(c)) \n        end if;\n\n      end do;\n    end do;\n  end do;\nend do; Increasing $N$ in the code produces more and more triplets that violate the conjecture.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"If 3 numbers of the form 1/(q²+1) have a mean of 1/2, will one of them always be 1/2?\" Then, in the question, the user defines the set S as containing elements of the form 1/(q²+1) where q is a positive rational number. They consider three elements a, b, c from S. The conjecture is that if the average of these three is 1/2, then at least one of them must be 1/2. The user provides examples where triplets like (f(1), f(q), f(1/q)) have the average 1/2, noting that f(1) is 1/2.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a, b, c are elements of S, which is defined as {1/(q²+1) | q ∈ ℚ⁺}. The mean of a, b, c is 1/2. The conjecture is that this implies at least one of a, b, or c is exactly 1/2. \n\nLooking at the example provided in the problem, they mention triplets like (f(1), f(q), f(1/q)). Since f(1) = 1/(1²+1) = 1/2, this seems to support the conjecture. However, the key is to list the assumptions without including the conjecture itself. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- a, b, c are elements of S (each is of the form 1/(q²+1) with q positive rational).\n- The mean of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nWait, but in the example the user gave, they structured the assumptions as separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for the original problem here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Each of a, b, c is of the form 1/(q² + 1), where q is a positive rational number.\n2. The average of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should be line by line, addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps each element a, b, c being in S is one assumption each? Wait, the example given in the problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each on a separate line, each a single condition on one object. So in this case, the set S is defined as elements of that form, so each of a, b, c being in S would be three separate assumptions? Wait, no. The problem says three elements a, b, c ∈ S. So maybe each element a, b, c is in S. But in the example, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each line is a separate condition on the same object. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are elements of S (each is 1/(q² +1) for some q ∈ ℚ⁺),\nThe mean of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. So for the user's problem:\n\nAssumption:\na is an element of S,\nb is an element of S,\nc is an element of S,\nThe mean of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut maybe S is defined as the set of all 1/(q² +1) for q ∈ ℚ⁺, so perhaps the first assumption is that a, b, c ∈ S. But according to the format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"a, b, c are elements of S\" is a single assumption, but maybe that's considered three separate conditions. However, in the example given, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", and the second \"n is divisible by 7\". So in this problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- a, b, c are elements of S (each being of the form 1/(q² +1) where q is a positive rational number),\n- The average of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut to adhere strictly to the example's structure, where each assumption is a separate line. Wait, the example had two assumptions:\n\n1. n is an integer,\n2. n is divisible by 7.\n\nEach as separate lines. So in this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a ∈ S,\n- b ∈ S,\n- c ∈ S,\n- The mean of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut S is defined as {1/(q²+1) | q ∈ ℚ⁺}, so each a, b, c is of that form. Alternatively, maybe the first assumption is that all three a, b, c are elements of S. But the example separated conditions on the same object. So perhaps each element being in S is one assumption each. But the problem states \"three elements of that set a,b,c ∈ S\". So maybe each of a, b, c being in S is three separate assumptions. However, in the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7 were separate. So perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\na is an element of S,\nb is an element of S,\nc is an element of S,\nThe average of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut I need to check if the problem mentions any other conditions. The original problem says that S is {1/(q²+1) | q ∈ ℚ⁺}, and a, b, c are elements of S. So the assumptions would be that each of a, b, c is in S (each of the form 1/(q²+1) with q a positive rational), and their average is 1/2. So in the assumptions, each a, b, c being in S would be three separate lines? But in the example, for n, two conditions on n were separate. So perhaps here, each of a, b, c being elements of S are three separate assumptions. However, the user's example didn't have multiple objects. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example given by the user:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in that case, two conditions on the same object n. In the current problem, the objects are a, b, c. So maybe each of them being in S is three separate assumptions. But the problem states \"three elements of that set a,b,c ∈ S\", so perhaps the first three assumptions are:\n\na ∈ S,\nb ∈ S,\nc ∈ S,\n\nThen the fourth assumption is that their average is 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a, b, c are elements of S\" is one assumption, but according to the example, each condition is on one object. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous, but the example had two conditions on the same object (n), so perhaps here, each element being in S is separate. Alternatively, since S is a set defined with q ∈ ℚ⁺, maybe the assumption is that each a, b, c is of the form 1/(q² +1) where q is a positive rational. But to split into separate lines, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\na = 1/(q₁² +1) for some q₁ ∈ ℚ⁺,\nb = 1/(q₂² +1) for some q₂ ∈ ℚ⁺,\nc = 1/(q₃² +1) for some q₃ ∈ ℚ⁺,\nThe average of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut this way, each a, b, c is defined with their own q. Alternatively, maybe the first assumption is that a, b, c are each in S, and S is defined as {1/(q²+1) | q ∈ ℚ⁺}. But according to the example, each assumption is a single line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are elements of S where S = {1/(q² +1) | q ∈ ℚ⁺},\nThe mean of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut the example broke down the conditions on n into separate lines. So perhaps in this problem, the first three assumptions are that a, b, c are in S, and the fourth is the mean. However, the example didn't have multiple objects. Maybe it's better to list the set membership once. Alternatively, the problem defines S as the set, so the assumption is that a, b, c are elements of S. Then the mean condition is another assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are elements of S (where S = {1/(q² +1) | q ∈ ℚ⁺}),\nThe average of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach of a, b, c is of the form 1/(q² +1) with q ∈ ℚ⁺,\nThe average of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut the example had two separate lines for n being integer and n divisible by 7. So if we follow that, the first line here would be that each a, b, c is in S, and the second line is the mean condition. Alternatively, if we have to split each property, but in this case, the first assumption is about the form of a, b, c, and the second about their mean.\n\nI think the intended way is to list each distinct assumption, even if they apply to multiple objects. So the first assumption is that a, b, c are each elements of S (each being 1/(q² +1) for some positive rational q), and the second assumption is that their average is 1/2. So two assumptions.\n\nBut the example had two conditions on the same object (n) as separate lines. So in this case, since the three elements are all of a certain form, maybe that's one assumption, and the mean is another. So:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are elements of S where S = {1/(q² +1) | q ∈ ℚ⁺},\nThe mean of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nBut the example's first assumption was \"n is an integer\", and the second \"n is divisible by 7\". So if we follow that structure, each condition on the variables. Here, the variables are a, b, c. So their membership in S is one assumption, and their mean is another. Alternatively, since each a, b, c is in S, maybe that's three separate assumptions, but that seems redundant. The example didn't list multiple variables. So perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\nEach of a, b, c is of the form 1/(q² +1) for some q ∈ ℚ⁺,\nThe average of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nSo two assumptions. That seems to align with the example where two conditions were listed. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach of a, b, c is of the form 1/(q² +1) for some q ∈ ℚ⁺,\nThe average of a, b, c is 1/2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that at least one of a, b, c is equal to 1/2.\n\nBut the original problem states \"will one of them always be 1/2?\" So the problem is to prove or disprove that if three elements of S have an average of 1/2, then one of them must be 1/2. So the problem part would be: \"Prove that if the average of a, b, c is 1/2, then at least one of a, b, c is equal to 1/2.\"\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was restated concisely. So here, the problem is to show that under the given assumptions, at least one of a, b, c is 1/2. So the problem statement would be: \"Prove that at least one of a, b, c equals 1/2.\"\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\nEach of a, b, c is of the form $\\frac{1}{q^2 + 1}$ for some $q \\in \\mathbb{Q^+}$,\nThe average of a, b, c is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nProblem:\nProve that at least one of a, b, c equals $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nI think that's correct. The assumptions are that each a, b, c is in S (defined by the form with q positive rational), and their average is 1/2. The problem is to prove that one of them must be 1/2. The example in the question had the problem restated similarly. The user's original question also included the conjecture in the implication form, but in the formatted problem, it's more concise.",
