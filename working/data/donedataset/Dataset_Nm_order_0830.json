    "Content": "$$\\int_0^1\\frac{3x^3-2x}{(1+x)\\sqrt{1-x}}K\\left(\\frac{2x}{1+x}\\right)\\,dx\\stackrel ?=\\frac\\pi{5\\sqrt2}$$ The integral above comes from the evaluation of the integral $A=\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{f(\\theta)}\\pi d\\theta$, where $$f(\\theta)=\\int_0^\\pi\\frac{(3\\sin^2\\theta-2)\\sin\\theta\\,d\\phi}{\\sqrt{2+2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi}}=\\frac{\\sqrt2(3\\sin^2\\theta-2)}{\\csc\\theta\\sqrt{1+\\sin\\theta}}\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\left(1-\\frac{2\\sin\\theta}{1+\\sin\\theta}\\sin^2\\gamma\\right)^{-1/2}d\\gamma,$$ where $\\gamma=\\phi/2$, and the right side integral is $K\\big(\\!\\frac{2\\sin\\theta}{1+\\sin\\theta}\\!\\big)$ by definition. After substitutions $x=\\sin\\theta$ and $y=\\frac{2x}{1+x}$ we get $$\\begin{align}A&=\\frac{\\sqrt2}\\pi\\int_0^1\\frac{3x^3-2x}{(1+x)\\sqrt{1-x}}K\\left(\\frac{2x}{1+x}\\right)\\,dx\\\\\n&=\\frac1\\pi\\int_0^1\\frac{y^3+8y^2-8y}{(2-y)^3\\sqrt{y^2-3y+2}}K(y)\\,dy\\stackrel ?=\\frac15,\\end{align}$$ where the integral has been numerically evaluated to suggest the analytic result on the right to several thousand digits. Is there any way to prove this equality, and are there any generalizations of this conjecture to include other parameters? P.S. Not that it's overly relevant to the question, but for the interested reader, the original integral comes from the following physics problem: [Morin Intro to Classical Mechanics , Ex. 10.12] The earth bulges slightly at the equator, due to the centrifugal force in the earth’s rotating frame. The goal of this exercise is to find the shape of the earth, first incorrectly, and then correctly. (a) The common incorrect method is to assume that the gravitation force from the slightly nonspherical earth points toward the center, and to then calculate the equipotential surface (incorporating both the gravitational and centrifugal forces). Show that this method leads to a surface whose height (relative to a spherical earth of the same volume) is given by $h(\\theta)=R\\big(\\!\\frac{R\\omega^2}{6g}\\!\\big)(3\\sin^2⁡\\theta-2)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (the angle down from the north pole), and $R$ is the radius of the earth. (b) The above method is incorrect, because the slight distortion of the earth causes the gravitational force to not point toward the center of the earth (except at the equator and the poles). This tilt in the force direction then changes the slope of the equipotential surface, and it turns out (although this is by no means obvious) that this effect is of the same order as the slope of the surface found in part (a). Your task: Assuming that the density of the earth is constant, and that the correct height takes the form of some constant factor $f$ times the result found in part (a), show that $f=5/2$. Do this by demanding that the potential at a pole equals the potential at the equator.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out the unrelated information, and structure it into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object per line, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem on Math Stack Exchange, the title is about an integral involving the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, K(y), and whether it equals π/(5√2). The question body starts with the integral expression and then goes into a detailed derivation involving substitutions, another integral A, and some physics background about the earth's shape. The user also mentions a possible generalization and asks for a proof of the equality.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem is to prove that the given integral equals π/(5√2). The integral is from 0 to 1 of [ (3x³ - 2x)/( (1+x)√(1-x) ) * K(2x/(1+x)) ] dx. The assumptions here would include the limits of integration (0 to 1), the integrand's structure, and the use of the complete elliptic integral K. However, in the example, assumptions were more about properties applied to objects. For example, in the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the integral's components are given, so maybe the assumptions are about the functions involved? But since the problem is to evaluate the integral, perhaps the key assumptions are about the substitution steps that led to this integral, but the user wants filtered unrelated info.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions substitutions x = sinθ and y = 2x/(1+x), leading to the integral A. But the problem presented is whether the integral equals π/(5√2). The example structured problem included the assumptions as given conditions. Here, perhaps the main assumptions are the definitions used, like K being the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, and the integrand's form. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variable's properties. Since the problem here is to prove the integral equals a specific value, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- K denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n- The integrand is correctly transformed from the physics problem (though the user might not need the physics context, so perhaps that's irrelevant).\n\nBut according to the instructions, the assistant should filter out unrelated information. The physics part is noted as \"not overly relevant,\" so we can exclude that. The problem is purely mathematical: prove the integral equals π/(5√2). So the assumptions would be the components of the integral. However, the example structured the assumptions as properties of the variables or conditions applied. In this integral problem, the variables are integrated over [0,1], and K is the elliptic integral. But the problem as stated in the example might not list definitions as assumptions. Wait, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions for the problem. In the current problem, maybe there are no explicit assumptions other than the integral setup. However, looking at the problem statement in the example, the user included the assumption that n is an integer (from the original problem) even though the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" which is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original example's problem was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem had assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there was a mistake? Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might not be correct. Wait, perhaps the example had a typo or mistake. However, the user provided that example, so we have to follow their structure. So in their example, they listed the assumptions as n being an integer and n divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer. The conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. However, 91 is 7×13. Perhaps the problem in the example required that n is such that 7 divides the expression, but the original problem didn't specify n divisible by 7. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed as properties applied to one object each.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to prove that the integral equals π/(5√2). The integral is from 0 to 1, involves K(2x/(1+x)), and the integrand is (3x³ -2x)/((1+x)√(1-x)). The question mentions substitutions leading to this integral, but perhaps the key assumptions are the substitutions and definitions. However, according to the user's instruction, we need to filter out unrelated information, like the physics background. The problem also mentions that after substitutions, the integral A is expressed in two forms, but the main problem is the first integral. The second integral with variable y is another form, but the question is about proving the first integral equals π/(5√2). The user also asks about generalizations, but the formatted problem should focus on the main problem.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- K denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n- The integrand is [ (3x³ - 2x) / ( (1 + x)√(1 - x) ) ] * K(2x/(1 + x)).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were properties of n. Here, perhaps the key is that K is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, which is defined as K(k) = ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - k² sin²θ]^{-1/2} dθ. But since K is standard, maybe that's considered a definition and not an assumption. Alternatively, the problem may assume that the substitutions are valid, leading to the integral form. However, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer, which is part of the problem's original statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the original statement is the integral equals π/(5√2). So maybe the assumptions are the components of the integral. But according to the user's example, assumptions are each a single property or condition applied to one object. Here, the integral is defined over x from 0 to 1, K is the elliptic integral, and the integrand is as given. But perhaps each of these is an assumption. Alternatively, the problem might not require additional assumptions beyond the integral's setup. However, in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is part of the problem's statement. Similarly, here, the integral is from 0 to 1, so that's an assumption. The integrand's form is another assumption. The use of K as the complete elliptic integral is another assumption. Each of these would be listed line by line.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is \\(\\frac{3x^3 - 2x}{(1 + x)\\sqrt{1 - x}} K\\left(\\frac{2x}{1 + x}\\right)\\).\n- \\(K\\) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that this integral equals \\(\\frac{\\pi}{5\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n\nBut wait, the user's example had two assumptions for the problem: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, it was stated \"for every integer n\". However, the formatted problem in the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory because the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example, but regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each as a single property.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is presented as is, with K being the elliptic integral, and the integrand given. Therefore, the assumptions are the components of the integral's setup. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{3x^3 - 2x}{(1 + x)\\sqrt{1 - x}} K\\left(\\frac{2x}{1 + x}\\right)\\),\n\\(K\\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals \\(\\frac{\\pi}{5\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n\nBut I need to check if the problem as stated in the original question includes any other implicit assumptions. The user mentions substitutions leading to the integral, but since the problem is to prove the equality, perhaps those substitutions are part of the derivation, not assumptions. The problem also mentions that the integral has been numerically evaluated to suggest the result, but that's background info, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the integral's components as assumptions and state the problem as proving the equality.",
