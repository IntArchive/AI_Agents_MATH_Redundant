    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\omega$ denote $(MNP)$ , and let its circumcentre be $O$ . Note that if $H$ is the orthocentre of $ABC$ , then $BN$ and $CP$ concur at $H$ as $MN \\parallel AC$ , and $MP \\parallel AB$ so $BN \\perp AC$ and $CP \\perp AB$ . Therefore, since $\\angle HNM = \\angle HPM = 90^{\\circ}$ , $H$ is the antipodal point of $M$ in $\\omega$ . Now, since $L$ is the reflection of $K$ in $\\omega$ , then $LN$ and $LP$ are tangent to $\\omega$ . This follows from similar triangles: $OK \\times OL = ON^2 \\implies \\frac{OK}{ON} = \\frac{ON}{OL}$ , and $\\angle LON$ is shared, so $\\triangle OKN \\sim \\triangle ONL \\implies \\angle ONL = \\angle OKN = 90^{\\circ}$ as $K$ is the midpoint of $NP$ . Therefore, $LN$ is tangent to $\\omega$ . A similar argument holds for $LP$ . Suppose $P_{\\infty}$ is the point at infinity on line $BC$ . Then, we have $$(B, C; M, P_{\\infty}) = -1.$$ Projecting these through $H$ onto $\\omega$ yields $$(N, P; M, H') = -1,$$ where $H'$ is the point on $\\omega$ such that $HH' \\parallel BC$ . From this relation, we get $MNH'P$ is a harmonic quadrilateral, which implies $MH'$ is the symmedian of $\\triangle MNP$ . However, $ML$ is the symmedian of $MNP$ as $L$ is the intersection of the tangents at $N$ and $P$ , so we must have $L, H', M$ collinear. Therefore, since $H'M \\perp BC$ (as $\\angle HH'M = 90^{\\circ}$ and $HH' \\parallel BC$ ), then $LM \\perp BC$ , so $LB = LC$ as $LM$ is a perpendicular bisector of $BC$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this geometry problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the given format, listing assumptions and then the problem statement. Let's start by breaking down the original question.\n\nThe problem is titled \"Prove that LB = LC.\" The question describes a geometric configuration involving triangle ABC with several constructed points: M, N, P, K, and L. Each of these points has specific relationships or properties.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions given in the problem. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's go through the question sentence by sentence.\n\n1. \"M is the midpoint of line segment BC.\" So, M divides BC into two equal parts. That's straightforward. Assumption: M is the midpoint of BC.\n\n2. \"N and P are points in triangle ABC such that PM ∥ AB and MN ∥ CA.\" Here, N and P are defined with parallelism conditions. PM is parallel to AB, and MN is parallel to CA. Since PM and MN are lines through points P-M and M-N respectively, each parallelism is a separate condition. So two assumptions here: PM is parallel to AB, and MN is parallel to CA. Each applies to different lines.\n\n3. \"CP ⊥ PM and MN ⊥ NB.\" Now, CP is perpendicular to PM, and MN is perpendicular to NB. Again, these are two separate perpendicularity conditions. So assumptions: CP is perpendicular to PM, and MN is perpendicular to NB.\n\n4. \"K is the midpoint of NP.\" Another midpoint. So K is the midpoint of NP.\n\n5. \"L is the reflection of K in the circumcircle of triangle MNP.\" Reflection here might mean that L is the reflection point with respect to the circumcircle, which typically would mean inversion across the circumcircle. But the exact definition might need clarification. However, as per the problem statement, we take this as given. So assumption: L is the reflection of K in the circumcircle of triangle MNP.\n\nFinally, the problem is to prove that LB = LC.\n\nNow, I need to list all these assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. Let me check again:\n\n- M is the midpoint of BC.\n- PM is parallel to AB.\n- MN is parallel to CA.\n- CP is perpendicular to PM.\n- MN is perpendicular to NB.\n- K is the midpoint of NP.\n- L is the reflection of K in the circumcircle of triangle MNP.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to specific objects (points or lines). There's no overlapping or combined conditions here. So these should be the seven assumptions.\n\nThen, the problem statement is to prove that LB equals LC.\n\nWait, but in the original example provided by the user, sometimes the assumptions might not include all the given conditions? Let me check the example again. The original example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that was a mistake in the example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which actually changes the problem. That might be an error. So perhaps the user intended that the assumptions are all the given conditions in the problem, but in the example, they mistakenly added an extra condition. Hmm. Maybe that example is not correctly formatted. But in the problem presented here, the user wants us to filter unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format.\n\nIn the current problem, the user hasn't added any extra conditions, so all the given conditions should be listed as assumptions. Therefore, the seven points I listed above are all the necessary assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these seven assumptions, each on a separate line, and the problem statement is to prove LB = LC.",
