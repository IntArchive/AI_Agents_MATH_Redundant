    "Content": "I'm trying to make sense of all these theorems related to ramification. I was hoping someone would summarize these results. Assume we have: An extension $L/K$ and a some subextensions $E_1,\\ldots,E_k$ sitting in between (without necessarily having $E_i\\leq E_j$ or vice versa for pairs). What about if some of these extensions are Galois? I was wondering what ramification of a prime in $L/K$ tells us about ramification for the $E_i/K$ or $L/E_i$ and vice versa? How much can we pin down where the ramification has to be in these subextensions or do we always have to just compute discriminants? I'm also trying to figure out how to compute Hilbert class fields. This is why I'm interested in how given some field $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ I should go about trying to find a field $L/K$ that kills all ramification? I should be able to somehow figure out what's allowed to ramify in $L/\\mathbb{Q}$? EDIT: This is one argument that I just don't get. The Hilbert Class Field of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5},\\sqrt{-1})$. Here's the standard argument: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})/\\mathbb{Q}$ is unramified outside of 5 and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})/\\mathbb{Q}$ is unramified outside 2. Hence, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5},\\sqrt{-1})/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ is unramified everywhere. Why can't there be some prime of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ that ramifies and ramifies above the other two extensions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\n\\newcommand{\\fp}{{\\mathfrak p}}\n\\newcommand{\\fP}{{\\mathfrak P}}\n$\nThe ramification in intermediate fields is a slightly delicate (purely group theoretic) issue. First, assume without loss of generality that $L/K$ is Galois with Galois group $G$, otherwise pass to the Galois closure and repeat the following argument for $L$ being the intermediate field. Suppose that you have a prime $\\fp$ of $K$ with prime $\\fP$ of $L$ lying above $\\fp$. Let $D=D_{\\fP/\\fp}$ be the decomposition group, i.e. the subgroup of $G$ consisting of elements that fix the place $\\fP$. Inside that, you have the inertia subgroup $I=I_{\\fP/\\fp}$. Recall that the index of $D$ in $G$ is the number of primes in $L$ lying above $\\fp$, and $|I|$ is the ramification index of $\\fP/\\fp$. The residue field degree is the index of $I$ in $D$. Now, let $E$ be an intermediate field, corresponding to a subgroup $H$ of $G$, so that $H=\\text{Gal}(L/E)$. Then Exercise 1: There is a natural bijection between double cosets $H\\backslash G/D$ and the primes of $E$ lying above $\\fp$. (You might want to begin by checking that this is independent of the choice of $\\fP$. Another prime above $\\fp$ would have given a conjugate decomposition group.) Exercise 2: If, under the above correspondence, the double coset $HgD$ corresponds to the prime $\\fp'$ of $L$, then\n$$\nD_{\\fP/\\fp'} = H\\cap D^g\\leq H\\text{ and } I_{\\fP/\\fp'} = H\\cap I^g\\leq H.\n$$\nThis allows you to compute the ramification index and the residue field degree of $\\fP/\\fp'$ as above. I hope that that answers your questions. As for explicit computation of Hilbert class fields, you might want to consult Sections 3 and 4 of Cohen's Advanced Topics in Computational Number Theory - a wonderful book that treats your question in great detail.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question. The user is asking about ramification in a tower of extensions and how it relates to subextensions. They also mention Hilbert class fields and have an example with Q(sqrt(-5)) and its Hilbert class field. \n\nFirst, the main problem seems to be understanding how ramification in a larger extension L/K affects or is affected by ramification in subextensions E_i/K or L/E_i. They want to know if we can determine where ramification occurs in these subextensions without computing discriminants every time. The specific example given is about the Hilbert class field of Q(sqrt(-5)) being Q(sqrt(-5), sqrt(-1)), and why the composite extension is unramified everywhere over Q(sqrt(-5)).\n\nSo, the assumptions here are probably related to the specific extensions mentioned. Let's break down the example. The user says that Q(sqrt(5))/Q is unramified outside 5, and Q(sqrt(-1))/Q is unramified outside 2. Then, when you take the composite Q(sqrt(-5), sqrt(-1)) over Q(sqrt(-5)), they claim it's unramified everywhere. The confusion is why primes in Q(sqrt(-5)) don't ramify in this composite.\n\nSo, for the formatted problem, the assumptions would be the specific extensions given and their ramification properties. The problem is to understand why the composite extension is unramified everywhere over Q(sqrt(-5)). \n\nPossible assumptions: \n- Q(sqrt(5))/Q is unramified outside 5.\n- Q(sqrt(-1))/Q is unramified outside 2.\n- The composite field Q(sqrt(-5), sqrt(-1)) is considered over Q(sqrt(-5)).\n\nProblem: Prove that Q(sqrt(-5), sqrt(-1))/Q(sqrt(-5)) is unramified everywhere.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user is asking why there can't be a prime of Q(sqrt(-5)) that ramifies in the composite. So maybe the problem is to show that no prime of Q(sqrt(-5)) ramifies in the extension Q(sqrt(-5), sqrt(-1))/Q(sqrt(-5)). \n\nSo the assumptions would be the specific extensions and their ramification properties over Q. Then the problem is to show that the extension of Q(sqrt(-5)) by sqrt(-1) is unramified at all primes. \n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The extension Q(sqrt(5))/Q is unramified outside 5.\n- The extension Q(sqrt(-1))/Q is unramified outside 2.\n- The composite field Q(sqrt(-5), sqrt(-1)) is considered as an extension over Q(sqrt(-5)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the extension Q(sqrt(-5), sqrt(-1))/Q(sqrt(-5)) is unramified everywhere.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the user's formatted problem extracted the assumptions from the original problem. In this case, the original question's example part is the specific case with Q(sqrt(-5)) and its Hilbert class field. So the assumptions would be the given extensions and their ramification properties. The problem is the specific question in the example: why the composite extension is unramified everywhere over Q(sqrt(-5)), i.e., why there's no ramification.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions from the example (the specific extensions and their ramification over Q) and then pose the problem as proving that the composite is unramified over Q(sqrt(-5)).\n\nSo, the assumptions would include the fields involved and their ramification over Q. Then the problem is to show that the extension L/K (with K=Q(sqrt(-5)), L=Q(sqrt(-5), sqrt(-1)) is unramified everywhere.",
