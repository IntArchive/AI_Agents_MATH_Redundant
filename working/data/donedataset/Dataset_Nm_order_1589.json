    "Content": "This MathOverflow post presents an alternative axiomatization of point-set topology that closely aligns with the intuitive notion that a topology on a set tells you which points are \"infinitesimally close\" to each other. The relevant part of the post is paraphrased below. Definition: A touch relation on a set $X$ is a binary relation $\\lessdot$ between the members of $X$ and the subsets of $X$ (we read $x \\lessdot A$ as \"$x$ touches $A$\") that satisfies the following axioms: No element of $X$ touches the empty set. If $x \\in A$, then $x \\lessdot A$. If $x \\lessdot (A \\cup B)$, then $x \\lessdot A$ or $x \\lessdot B$. If $x \\lessdot A$ and every element of $A$ touches $B$, then $x \\lessdot B$. I would like to prove that these axioms are indeed equivalent to the usual axioms for a topology in terms of open sets. To do this, I need to exhibit for any given set $X$ a bijective correspondence between touch relations on $X$ and topologies on $X$. I believe the correct correspondence is as follows: Given a touch relation on $X$, we obtain a topology on $X$ by declaring $A \\subseteq X$ to be open if and only if no member of $A$ touches $X \\setminus A$. Given a topology on $X$, we obtain a touch relation on $X$ by declaring that $x \\lessdot A$ if and only if $x \\in \\overline{A}$, where $\\overline{A}$ denotes the topological clousure (intersection of all closed supersets) of $A$. So far I have been able to show that both of these maps are well-defined (i.e., that they do produce a topology from a touch relation and vice versa). I can also show that the first map is a left inverse of the second (i.e., by starting from a topology $T$ on $X$, constructing the touch relation $\\lessdot$ induced by $T$, and then constructing the topology $T'$ induced by $\\lessdot$, we always have that $T = T'$). To finish off the proof, I need to show that the first map is a right inverse of the second, which I haven't yet figured out how to do. If I've unwound the definitions correctly, showing that the touch relation $\\to$ topology $\\to$ touch relation round-trip is the identity map amounts to proving the following: If $\\lessdot$ is a touch relation on $X$, then $x \\lessdot A$ if and only if $x$ is a member of every superset $B$ of $A$ with the property that $b \\lessdot B \\implies b \\in B$. (Let's call such a set $B$ \"touch-closed.\") The left-to-right implication is easy, but the right-to-left implication eludes me. Question: Let $\\lessdot$ be a touch relation on $X$, and let $A \\subseteq X$ be given. Suppose that $x$ is a member of every touch-closed superset of $A$. How can I  prove that $x \\lessdot A$? My partial proof attempt follows. Proof: Let $C$ be the intersection of every touch-closed superset of $A$. By hypothesis, $x \\in C$, so $x \\lessdot C$. Using the fourth touch axiom, it suffices to show that every element of $C$ touches $A$. To do this, suppose the the sake of contradiction that some element $c \\in C$ does not touch $A$. Then I claim that there exists a touch-closed superset $B$ of $A$ not containing $c$. Indeed...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $C = \\newcommand{\\set}[1]{\\left\\{{#1}\\right\\}}\\set{x:x\\lessdot A}$ . By axiom (ii), this is a superset of $A$ , by axiom (iv), it is touch closed. Clearly it is a subset of every touch closed superset of $A$ , so it is the intersection of all touch closed supersets of $A$ . Thus we have an equality of sets that shows the desired equivalence that $x\\lessdot A$ if and only if $x$ is in every touch closed superset of $A$ . Edit: My original answer to the question is above. user56834 has offered a bounty to give a precise statement and proof that the touch axiomatization is equivalent to the classical axiomatization of point set topology, and it's kind of an interesting question, which I've already partially answered, so I thought I'd complete this answer. In the interests of a self contained answer, I'll include the definition from the question. Answer to bounty question Definition: A touch relation on a set $X$ is a binary relation $\\lessdot$ between the members of $X$ and the subsets of $X$ (we read $x \\lessdot A$ as \" $x$ touches $A$ \") that satisfies the following axioms: No element of $X$ touches the empty set. If $x \\in A$ , then $x \\lessdot A$ . If $x \\lessdot A \\cup B$ , then $x \\lessdot A$ or $x \\lessdot B$ . If $x \\lessdot A$ and every element of $A$ touches $B$ , then $x \\lessdot B$ . The definition I will show is equivalent There are many already well known equivalent axiomatizations for point set topology. The easiest one to connect to touch relations is the closure operator axiomatization (due to Kuratowski) see the link to Wiki for the connection between the closure operator axiomatization and the closed set axiomatization. Definition: A closure operator on a set $X$ is a map $\\newcommand\\calP{\\mathcal{P}}\\newcommand\\cl{\\operatorname{cl}}\\cl:\\calP(X)\\to\\calP(X)$ such that $\\cl(\\varnothing)=\\varnothing$ $A\\subseteq \\cl(A)$ $\\cl(A\\cup B) =\\cl(A)\\cup\\cl(B)$ $\\cl(\\cl(A))=\\cl(A)$ Note that axiom 3 implies that closure operators are order preserving, since\nif $A\\subseteq B$ , then $A\\cup B=B$ , so $\\cl(B)=\\cl(A\\cup B)=\\cl(A)\\cup\\cl(B)$ , which implies that $\\cl(A)\\subseteq \\cl(B)$ . The equivalence From comparing the axioms, it should be clear that the axioms for touch relations are a fairly direct translation of Kuratowski's axioms for closure operators. Here is the explicit correspondence. Given a closure operator $\\cl$ , the relation $x \\lessdot A$ if $x\\in \\cl(A)$ is a touch relation, and given a touch relation, $\\lessdot$ , the operator $\\cl(A) = \\set{x\\in X: x\\lessdot A}$ is a closure operator. Moreover, these correspondences are inverses of each other, yielding a bijection between touch relations and closure operators on $X$ . Proof: A note on notation. I will refer to the touch axioms as T1-T4 and the closure axioms as K1-K4 (the K standing for Kuratowski). Let $\\cl$ be a closure operator. Then the associated touch relation satisfies No $x$ touches $\\varnothing$ , since there are no $x$ in $\\cl(\\varnothing)=\\varnothing$ by K1. If $x\\in A$ , then $x\\lessdot A$ , since $x\\in A$ implies $x\\in \\cl(A)$ by K2. If $x\\lessdot A\\cup B$ , then $x\\lessdot A$ or $x\\lessdot B$ , since by K3, $\\cl(A\\cup B)=\\cl(A)\\cup \\cl(B)$ , so if $x\\in \\cl(A\\cup B)$ , then $x\\in \\cl(A)$ or $x\\in\\cl(B)$ . If $x\\lessdot A$ and $a\\lessdot B$ for all $a\\in A$ , then $x\\lessdot B$ , since if $a\\lessdot B$ for all $a\\in A$ , then $A\\subseteq \\cl(B)$ , so $\\cl(A)\\subseteq \\cl(\\cl(B))=\\cl(B)$ since closure operators are order preserving, and by K4. Thus we have that if $x\\lessdot A$ , then $x\\lessdot B$ . Conversely , given a touch relation $\\lessdot$ , the associated closure operator satisfies the Kuratowski axioms. Before proving that, note that T2 and T4 imply that that associated closure operator is order preserving, since\nif $A\\subseteq B$ , then T2 says that for all $a\\in A$ , $a\\lessdot B$ , and thus T4 says that if $x\\lessdot A$ , then $x\\lessdot B$ . Hence $\\cl(A)\\subseteq \\cl(B)$ if $A\\subseteq B$ . Now to prove that the Kuratowski axioms hold: $\\cl(\\varnothing)=\\varnothing$ , since nothing touches the empty set by T1. $A\\subset \\cl(A)$ by T2. $\\cl(A\\cup B)=\\cl(A)\\cup \\cl(B)$ , since by T3, we have $\\cl(A\\cup B)\\subseteq \\cl(A)\\cup\\cl(B)$ , and conversely, since the closure operator is order preserving, $\\cl(A)\\subseteq \\cl(A\\cup B)$ and $\\cl(B)\\subseteq \\cl(A\\cup B)$ . Thus $\\cl(A)\\cup\\cl(B)\\subseteq \\cl(A\\cup B)$ as well. $\\cl(\\cl(A))=\\cl(A)$ , by T4, since for all $x\\in \\cl(A)$ , $x\\lessdot A$ by definition, so if $y\\lessdot \\cl(A)$ , then $y\\lessdot A$ . Hence $\\cl(\\cl(A))\\subseteq \\cl(A)$ , and we already know $\\cl(A)\\subseteq \\cl(\\cl(A))$ by the proof of K2 above. Finally, I should justify that these correspondences are inverses of each other, although it's fairly straightforward. Starting with a touch relation, we define $\\cl(A)=\\set{x\\in X : x\\lessdot A}$ , and then we define $x\\lessdot' A$ by $x\\in \\cl(A)$ . However $x\\in\\cl(A)$ if and only if $x \\lessdot A$ , so $x\\lessdot' A$ if and only if $x\\lessdot A$ , so $\\lessdot'=\\lessdot$ . Conversely, starting with a closure operator, we define $x\\lessdot A$ by $x\\in\\cl(A)$ , and then a new closure operator by $\\cl'(A)=\\set{x\\in X : x\\lessdot A}$ . But then $x\\in\\cl'(A) \\iff x\\lessdot A \\iff x\\in\\cl(A)$ , so $\\cl'(A)=\\cl(A)$ for all $A$ , so $\\cl'=\\cl$ . Thus the correspondences are inverses of each other. $\\blacksquare$ Side note Wiki already has an article for touch relations, calling it the \"closeness relation\", but it doesn't note that such a relation is equivalent to a topology. Further edit In response to the comments below, I've decided to state and prove the direct equivalence between touch relations and open sets. First, recall Definition : $\\tau\\subseteq \\calP(X)$ is a topology on $X$ and its elements are called open subsets of $X$ if $\\varnothing,X\\in \\tau$ (the null set and $X$ are open) $\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in I} U_\\alpha \\in \\tau$ , where $I$ is any index set and $U_\\alpha\\in \\tau$ for all $\\alpha\\in I$ . (arbitrary unions of opens are open) $\\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \\in \\tau$ for all $n\\ge 0$ when all of the $U_i$ are in $\\tau$ . (finite intersections of opens are open) Note: With the axiomatization I just gave, axiom 1 is redundant, since the null set is the empty union and the whole set is the empty intersection. The equivalence between touch relations and open sets Given a touch relation $\\lessdot$ , the collection of sets $U$ satisfying $x\\not\\lessdot U^C$ for all $x\\in U$ gives a topology on $X$ . Conversely, given a topology on $X$ , the relation $x\\lessdot A$ if $x\\in \\cl(A)$ defines a touch relation on $X$ (in terms of open sets, this relation is that $x\\lessdot A$ if there is no open $U$ with $x\\in U$ and $U\\cap A =\\varnothing$ ). Moreover, these correspondences are inverses of each other. Proof: First, suppose that $\\lessdot$ is a touch relation on $X$ . We need to show that the definition of open given in the statement defines a topology on $X$ . Let $$U = \\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in I} U_\\alpha,$$ with all $U_\\alpha$ open, and suppose $x\\lessdot U^C$ , then since $U^C\\subseteq U_\\alpha^C$ for all $\\alpha$ , by T2 and T4, we have that $x\\lessdot U_\\alpha^C$ for all $\\alpha$ , so $x\\not \\in U_\\alpha$ for all $\\alpha$ , and hence $x\\not\\in U$ . Thus $U$ is open. For intersections, it suffices to show that the empty intersection and the binary intersection of opens are open. Now the empty intersection is $X$ , and $X^C=\\varnothing$ , so there are no $x$ with $x\\lessdot X^C$ by T1, and thus $X$ is open. Finally, by T3, if $x\\lessdot (U\\cap V)^C = U^C\\cup V^C$ , then either $x\\lessdot U^C$ or $X\\lessdot V^C$ . Either way, when $U$ and $V$ are open, either $x\\not\\in U$ or $x\\not\\in V$ , so $x\\not\\in U\\cap V$ . Hence if $U$ and $V$ are open, $U\\cap V$ is open. Thus a touch relation defines a topology. Conversely , given a topology, we know that $x\\in \\cl(A)$ defines a touch relation, by the argument I gave earlier, since $\\cl$ is a closure operator. However, if I restrict to only talking about open sets, we can define $x\\lessdot A$ if for all open sets $U$ , $x\\in U$ implies that $U\\cap A\\ne \\varnothing$ . Now we'll prove that this satisfies the touch relation axioms. Regardless of $x$ , for all open sets $U$ , $U\\cap \\varnothing =\\varnothing$ , so no element of $X$ touches the empty set. If $x\\in A$ , then if $x\\in U$ , $x\\in U\\cap A$ , so $U\\cap A\\ne \\varnothing$ , and thus if $x\\in A$ , $x\\lessdot A$ . Suppose $x\\lessdot A\\cup B$ , then for all open $U$ containing $x$ , $U\\cap (A\\cup B) = (U\\cap A)\\cup (U\\cap B)\\ne \\varnothing$ . Now suppose $x\\not\\lessdot A$ , so there exists an open set $V$ with $V\\cap A=\\varnothing$ . Now for any open set $U$ , we know that $$(U\\cap V)\\cap (A\\cup B) = (U\\cap V\\cap A) \\cup (U\\cap V\\cap B) = U\\cap V\\cap B \\ne \\varnothing,$$ and thus $U\\cap B\\ne\\varnothing$ .\nHence if $x\\not\\lessdot A$ , then $x\\lessdot B$ , and therefore T3 holds. Finally, if $x\\lessdot A$ , and for all $a\\in A$ , $a\\lessdot B$ , we need to show that $x\\lessdot B$ . However, if $x\\not\\lessdot B$ , then there exists an open $U$ with $x\\in U$ and $U\\cap B=\\varnothing$ . However, since $x\\lessdot A$ , $U\\cap A \\ne \\varnothing$ . Then if $a\\in U\\cap A$ , we have that $U$ is an open set containing $a$ and disjoint from $B$ , contradicting the fact that $a\\lessdot B$ . Hence T4 holds. Finally, these should be inverse correspondences. This is immediate from the fact that the correspondences between touch relations and closure operators were inverses, since all this correspondence is is the composition of that correspondence with the correspondence between closure operators and open sets. However, working it out explicitly, we have. Suppose we start with a touch relation $\\lessdot$ . Then we obtain a topology $\\tau$ and a new touch relation $\\lessdot'$ in the manner described above. We need to show that $x\\lessdot A$ if and only if $x\\lessdot' A$ . Suppose $x\\not \\lessdot A$ , then define $U=\\set{x\\in X : x\\not\\lessdot A}$ . $U\\cap A=\\varnothing$ , by T2, and $x\\in U$ by assumption, and $U$ is open, since if $x\\lessdot U^C$ , then $x\\lessdot A$ by T4, so $x\\not\\in U$ . This $U$ shows that $x\\not\\lessdot' A$ . Conversely, if $x\\lessdot A$ , then if $U$ is open and $x\\in U$ , then supposing that for all $a\\in A$ , $a\\in U^C$ , then by T4, we'd have $x\\lessdot U^C$ , contradicting that $x\\in U$ and $U$ is open. Hence for some $a\\in A$ , $a\\in U$ . Since $U\\cap A\\ne \\varnothing$ for all open $U$ containing $x$ , we have $x\\lessdot' A$ . Thus $\\lessdot=\\lessdot'$ as desired. On the other hand, suppose we start with a topology $\\tau$ . Let $\\lessdot$ be the associated touch relation, and $\\tau'$ the topology associated to this touch relation. We need to show that $\\tau=\\tau'$ . If $U\\in\\tau$ , then for all $x\\in U$ , $x\\not\\lessdot U^C$ , since $U$ is an open set containing $x$ with $U\\cap U^C=\\varnothing$ . Thus $U\\in \\tau'$ , and $\\tau\\subseteq \\tau'$ . On the other hand, if $U\\in \\tau'$ , then for all $x\\in U$ , $x\\not\\lessdot U^C$ , so there exists $V_x\\in\\tau$ with $x\\in V_x$ , and $V_x\\cap U^C=\\varnothing$ . Then $$U=\\bigcup_{x\\in U} V_x,$$ so $U\\in \\tau$ . Hence $\\tau=\\tau'$ as desired. $\\blacksquare$ Side comment After some more thinking, I realized that the touch relation fits neatly into a rough characterization of the common axiomatizations of point set topology. Ignoring the \"partial\" definitions (i.e. things like bases and nhood bases),\nwe can categorize them in the following way: $$\\begin{array}{ccc}\n \\text{global} & \\text{operator} & \\text{local}\n\\\\ \\hline\n \\text{open sets} & \\text{interior operator} & \\text{neighborhoods}\n\\\\  \n\\text{closed sets} & \\text{closure operator} & \\text{touch relation}\n\\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$ The parallel between neighborhoods and touch relations is that we can think of specifying the neighborhoods of a point as giving a relation $x \\prec N$ if $N$ is a neighborhood of $x$ . Then to convert between $\\prec$ and $\\lessdot$ , we say $x\\lessdot A$ if $x\\not\\prec A^C$ and $x\\prec N$ if $x\\not \\lessdot N^C$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is trying to show that in the context of touch relations and their corresponding topologies, if a point x is in every touch-closed superset of A, then x must touch A. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A touch-closed set B is one where if any element touches B, then that element is in B. So B is touch-closed if for all b, if b ≲ B, then b ∈ B. \n\nThe user has defined C as the intersection of all touch-closed supersets of A. Since x is in every such superset, x must be in C. Then, they note that by the fourth touch axiom, if x touches C and every element of C touches A, then x touches A. But they need to show that every element of C touches A. \n\nSuppose for contradiction that some c ∈ C does not touch A. The user's idea is to construct a touch-closed superset B of A that excludes c, which would contradict the fact that c is in C (since C is the intersection of all such B). \n\nBut how do we construct such a B? If c doesn't touch A, maybe we can remove c from some superset. Wait, but A is a subset of B, and B needs to be touch-closed. Let's consider B = A ∪ {elements that must be in B because they touch B}. Wait, maybe we can take B as the union of A and all elements that touch B. But that seems circular. \n\nAlternatively, since c doesn't touch A, maybe we can take B = X \\ {c}? But is that touch-closed? Let's check. Suppose some element d touches B. Then d must be in B. If d touches B, which is X \\ {c}, then if d were c, does c touch B? If c does not touch A, but B is a superset of A, perhaps c does touch B? Wait, maybe not. Since c doesn't touch A, but B contains A. Wait, but B could be A ∪ something else. \n\nAlternatively, consider that since c doesn't touch A, by the definition of touch-closed sets, maybe we can remove c from a larger set. Let me think. Let’s define B as the union of A and all elements that do touch A. Wait, but that might not be touch-closed. \n\nWait, another approach: if c doesn't touch A, then by the fourth axiom, maybe we can find a set that excludes c but still contains A. The user suggested that such a B exists. Let's try to construct it. Let’s take B = C \\ {c}. But is B touch-closed? Suppose some element d touches B. Then d must be in B. But if d touches B, which is a subset of C, then by the fourth axiom, since every element of B is in C, which is touch-closed... Hmm, this might not work. \n\nWait, perhaps using the third axiom. If c doesn't touch A, then maybe we can use the complement of {c} somehow. Let me recall that in topology terms, touch relation corresponds to closure, so x ≲ A iff x is in the closure of A. So in topological terms, the problem reduces to: if x is in every closed set containing A, then x is in the closure of A. But that's exactly the definition of closure; the closure is the intersection of all closed sets containing A. So in topology, closure of A is the smallest closed set containing A, which is exactly the intersection of all closed supersets. So if x is in every closed superset of A, then x is in the closure, hence x ≲ A. \n\nBut in the touch relation framework, we need to do this without assuming topology, just using the touch axioms. So perhaps the user's approach is to show that C (the intersection of all touch-closed supersets) is touch-closed, and then that C is equal to the closure of A under the touch relation. Then, since x is in C, x must touch A. \n\nWait, but the user's partial proof starts by noting that x ≲ C (since x is in C and by the second axiom, if x ∈ C then x ≲ C). Then by the fourth axiom, if every element of C touches A, then x ≲ A. So the key is to show that every element of C touches A. \n\nSuppose for contradiction that some c ∈ C doesn't touch A. Then, the user wants to construct a touch-closed superset B of A that excludes c. If such a B exists, then c wouldn't be in the intersection C, which contradicts c ∈ C. \n\nSo how to build B? Let's define B as the union of A and all elements that do touch A. Wait, but that might not be touch-closed. Alternatively, take B as the set of all elements that are not in C but... No, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, consider that if c doesn't touch A, then perhaps there exists a touch-closed superset of A that doesn't include c. Let's try to construct such a B. Let B be the smallest touch-closed set containing A. Wait, but C is the intersection of all touch-closed supersets, which would be the smallest one. But if c is in C, then c is in every touch-closed superset, which would mean there's no such B. Contradiction. \n\nWait, the user's approach is to assume that there's some c ∈ C that doesn't touch A, and then construct a touch-closed superset B of A that excludes c. If that's possible, then c isn't in B, contradicting that c is in all such B. \n\nSo how to construct B? Let me think. If c doesn't touch A, maybe B can be defined as the set of all elements that touch A. Wait, but A is a subset of B? Not necessarily. \n\nAlternatively, consider the set B = A ∪ { elements that touch B }. But this is circular. \n\nWait, perhaps use the complement. Let’s consider the set B = X \\ {c}. Is this touch-closed? For B to be touch-closed, any element that touches B must be in B. So if an element d touches B, then d ≠ c. Suppose c touches B. Then since B = X \\ {c}, if c touches B, then by the definition of touch-closed, c should be in B, but c is not in B. Hence, if B is touch-closed, then c cannot touch B. \n\nBut does c touch B? Since B is a superset of A (if we take B = X \\ {c} and c ∉ B), but A is a subset of B only if c ∉ A. Wait, but A could contain c. Wait, no, because if c ∈ A, then by the second axiom, c ≲ A, but we supposed that c does not touch A. Hence, c ∉ A. Therefore, A is a subset of B = X \\ {c}. \n\nSo B = X \\ {c} is a superset of A. Now, we need to check if B is touch-closed. Suppose some element d touches B. Then d must be in B. So if d ≲ B, then d ∈ B. Suppose d = c. Then c ≲ B would imply c ∈ B, which is false. So for B to be touch-closed, it must be that c does not touch B. \n\nBut does c touch B? B = X \\ {c}. If we can show that c does not touch B, then B is touch-closed. Let's see. Suppose c touches B. By the fourth axiom, if every element of B touches B, then c would touch B. Wait, but every element of B is in B, so by the second axiom, every element of B touches B. Then by the fourth axiom, if c touches B, then since every element of B touches B, c would touch B. Wait, but how does that help? \n\nAlternatively, since B = X \\ {c}, and we need to check whether c touches B. If c does not touch B, then B is touch-closed. If c does touch B, then B is not touch-closed. So to have B be touch-closed, we need c not to touch B. \n\nBut how do we ensure that c does not touch B? Given that c doesn't touch A, and B is a superset of A. Maybe using the fourth axiom again. Suppose c touches B. Then by the fourth axiom, since every element of B touches B (by the second axiom, as they are in B), then c would touch B. Wait, this seems circular. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the third axiom. If c touches B, which is X \\ {c}, then c touches (A ∪ (B \\ A)). Since B is a superset of A, B = A ∪ (B \\ A). By the third axiom, if c touches B, then c touches A or c touches (B \\ A). But we assumed c does not touch A, so c must touch (B \\ A). But B \\ A is a subset of X \\ {c}. However, we need to derive a contradiction here. \n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's think back to the original problem. The user is trying to show that if x is in every touch-closed superset of A, then x ≲ A. \n\nIn topology terms, this is equivalent to saying that if x is in every closed set containing A, then x is in the closure of A. Which is exactly the definition of closure. So in the topological interpretation, this is straightforward. But here, we need to prove it using the touch axioms. \n\nPerhaps the key is to show that the intersection C of all touch-closed supersets of A is itself touch-closed. Because then, since C is touch-closed and contains A, then x being in C implies x ≲ C (by the second axiom). Then, since every element of C is in every touch-closed superset of A, we need to show that every element of C touches A. If that's true, then by the fourth axiom, x ≲ C and every element of C touches A implies x ≲ A. \n\nBut how to show that every element of C touches A? Suppose there's an element c ∈ C that doesn't touch A. Then, as the user suggests, we can construct a touch-closed superset B of A that doesn't contain c, contradicting that c is in C. \n\nTo construct B, perhaps take the union of A and all elements that do touch A. Let's define B as { x | x ∈ A or x ≲ A }. Wait, but does this set B contain A? Yes. Is B touch-closed? Let's check. Suppose some element d ≲ B. We need to show d ∈ B. If d ≲ B, then by the third axiom, d ≲ A or d ≲ (B \\ A). But B \\ A would be elements that touch A but are not in A. So d ≲ A implies d ∈ B by definition. If d ≲ (B \\ A), then since B \\ A consists of elements that touch A, then by the fourth axiom, since each element of B \\ A touches A, then d ≲ A. Hence, d ∈ B. So B is touch-closed. \n\nTherefore, B is a touch-closed superset of A. But if c ∉ B, then c is not in A and c does not touch A. But c is supposed to be in every touch-closed superset of A, including B. Hence, c must be in B, which means c ∈ A or c ≲ A. But we assumed c ∉ A (since if c were in A, by the second axiom, c ≲ A), and c does not touch A. Contradiction. Therefore, such a c cannot exist, so every element of C touches A. \n\nTherefore, x ≲ C, and every element of C touches A, so by the fourth axiom, x ≲ A. \n\nSo the user's approach was correct, but they needed to construct B as the set of elements in A or touching A. This B is touch-closed and contains A. If c doesn't touch A, then c ∉ B, contradicting c being in the intersection C. Hence, every element of C must touch A, allowing the use of the fourth axiom to conclude x ≲ A.",
