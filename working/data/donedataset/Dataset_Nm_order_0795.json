    "Content": "Today, in a personal communication, I was asked to prove the classical result\n$$\\boxed{ \\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^3\\sinh(\\pi n)} = \\frac{\\pi^3}{360}}\\tag{CR} $$\nwhich I believe is due to Ramanujan. My proof can be found here and it is based on the closed form for $\\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{1}{m^2+n^2}$ and double counting. I would use this question for collecting alternative proofs . I am already aware that standard techniques for tackling series with a similar structure are The Poisson summation formula ; The residue theorem coupled with the Laplace transform of $\\text{Li}_k$ (I used this approach due to Simon Plouffe here , for instance); Eisenstein series related to Gaussian integers; Identities involving Dirichlet's series, since $$r_2(N)=\\left|\\{(a,b)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^2:a^2+b^2=N\\}\\right|=4 \\sum_{d\\mid N}\\chi_4(d)$$\n(this can be regarded as an analytic-combinatorial equivalent of the statement \" $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a UFD \"). I also know that a cornerstone is given by Zucker's The Summation of Series of Hyperbolic Functions , 1979. Let us see if we can devise a very short proof of $(\\text{CR})$ through these ingredients or other ones.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose we seek to show that $$\\sum_{n\\ge 1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^3} \\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\pi n)}\n= \\frac{\\pi^3}{360}.$$ Using $$\\frac{1}{\\sinh(x)} = \\frac{2}{e^x-e^{-x}}\n= 2\\frac{e^{-x}}{1-e^{-2x}}$$ this is the same as $$\\sum_{n\\ge 1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^3}\n\\frac{e^{-n\\pi}}{1-e^{-2n\\pi}}\n= \\frac{\\pi^3}{720}.$$ The sum  term may  be evaluated  using harmonic  summation techniques.\nSince  this  method  has  not   been  presented  I  will  detail  this\ncalculation here. Let $p$ be a positive integer and introduce $$S(x;p) =\n\\sum_{n\\ge 1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^{2p+1}}\n\\frac{e^{-nx}}{1-e^{-2nx}}.$$ We will evaluate $S(\\pi;p)$ using a functional  equation for $S(x;p)$ that is obtained by inverting its Mellin transform. Recall the harmonic sum identity $$\\mathfrak{M}\\left(\\sum_{k\\ge 1} \\lambda_k g(\\mu_k x);s\\right) =\n\\left(\\sum_{k\\ge 1} \\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\mu_k^s} \\right) g^*(s)$$ where $g^*(s)$ is the Mellin transform of $g(x).$ In the present case we have $$\\lambda_k = \\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k^{2p+1}}, \\quad\n\\mu_k = k\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\ng(x) = \\frac{e^{-x}}{1-e^{-2x}}.$$ We need the Mellin transform $g^*(s)$ of $g(x)$ which is $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-x}}{1-e^{-2x}} x^{s-1} dx\n= \\int_0^\\infty \n\\sum_{q\\ge 0} e^{- (2 q+1) x} x^{s-1} dx\n=  \\sum_{q\\ge 0}  \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(2q+1)x} x^{s-1} dx \n\\\\= \\Gamma(s) \\sum_{q\\ge 0} \\frac{1}{(2q+1)^s}\n= \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^s}\\right) \\Gamma(s) \\zeta(s)$$ with fundamental strip $\\langle 1, \\infty\\rangle.$ It follows that the Mellin transform $Q(s)$ of the harmonic sum $S(x;p)$ is given by $$Q(s) = \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^s}\\right) \n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{s+2p}}\\right)\n\\Gamma(s) \\zeta(s) \\zeta(s+2p+1)\n\\\\ \\text{because}\\quad\n\\sum_{k\\ge 1} \\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\mu_k^s} = \n\\sum_{k\\ge 1} \\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k^{2p+1}} \\frac{1}{k^s}\n= \\left(1-\\frac{2}{2^{s+2p+1}}\\right) \\zeta(s+2p+1)$$ for $\\Re(s+2p+1) > 1$ or $\\Re(s) \\gt -2p.$ The Mellin inversion integral here is $$\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{3/2-i\\infty}^{3/2+i\\infty} Q(s)/x^s ds$$ which we evaluate  by shifting it to the left  for an expansion about\nzero. Fortunately the  trivial zeros of  the two zeta function  terms cancel\nthe poles of the gamma function  term. The first term cancels those at $-2m$ where $m\\ge 1$ and the second  one the odd ones from $-2p-3$ on,\nwhich leaves  the poles at $s=1$ ,  and $-2q-1$ with $0\\le  q\\le p.$ It\nwould appear there is a pole at $s=-2p$ but this is not the case since\nwe  have two  simple poles  among  the five  terms but  also two  zero\nvalues,  making for  cancelation. The  pole  at $s=0$ is canceled  as\nwell. For the residue at $s=1$ we find $$\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2^{2p+1}-1}{2^{2p+1}} \n\\times 1 \\times \\zeta(2p+2) \\frac{1}{x}\n= \\frac{2^{2p+1}-1}{2^{2p+2}} \n\\frac{(-1)^{p} B_{2p+2}  (2\\pi)^{2p+2}}{2 (2p+2)!} \\frac{1}{x}\n\\\\ = (2^{2p+1}-1) \n\\frac{(-1)^{p} B_{2p+2} \\pi^{2p+2}}{2 (2p+2)!} \\frac{1}{x}.$$ The negative odd values at $s=-2q-1$ yield $$\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{-2q-1}}\\right) \n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{2p-2q-1}}\\right)\n\\frac{(-1)^{2q+1}}{(2q+1)!} \\zeta(-2q-1) \\zeta(2p-2q) x^{2q+1}\n\\\\ = (1-2^{2q+1}) \n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{2p-2q-1}}\\right)\n\\frac{1}{(2q+1)!} \\frac{B_{2q+2}}{2q+2}\n\\frac{(-1)^{p-q+1} B_{2p-2q} (2\\pi)^{2p-2q}}{2(2p-2q)!}\nx^{2q+1}\n\\\\ = \\frac{1}{2} (1-2^{2q+1}) \n(2^{2p-2q-1}-1)\n\\frac{(-1)^{p-q+1}}{(2q+1)!}\n\\frac{B_{2q+2} B_{2p-2q} \\pi^{2p-2q}}{(2p-2q)! (q+1)}\nx^{2q+1}.$$ Shifting to $\\Re(s) = -2p -3/2$ we get $$S(x;p) =\n(2^{2p+1}-1) \n\\frac{(-1)^{p} B_{2p+2} \\pi^{2p+2}}{2 (2p+2)!} \\frac{1}{x}\n\\\\ +\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{q=0}^p\n(1-2^{2q+1}) \n(2^{2p-2q-1}-1)\n\\frac{(-1)^{p-q+1}}{(2q+1)!}\n\\frac{B_{2q+2} B_{2p-2q} \\pi^{2p-2q}}{(2p-2q)! (q+1)}\nx^{2q+1}\n\\\\ + \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \n\\int_{-2p-3/2-i\\infty}^{-2p-3/2+i\\infty} Q(s)/x^s ds.$$ We will turn this into the promised functional equation. Substitute $s = -2p - t$ in the remainder integral to get $$- \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \n\\int_{3/2+i\\infty}^{3/2-i\\infty}\n\\left(1-2^{2p+t}\\right) \n\\left(1-2^t\\right)\n\\Gamma(-2p-t) \\zeta(-2p-t) \\zeta(1-t)\nx^{t+2p} dt$$ which is $$\\frac{x^{2p}}{2\\pi i} \n\\int_{3/2-i\\infty}^{3/2+i\\infty}\n\\left(1-2^{2p+t}\\right) \n\\left(1-2^t\\right)\n\\Gamma(-2p-t) \\zeta(-2p-t) \\zeta(1-t)\nx^{t} dt.$$ In view of  the desired functional equation we  now use the functional\nequation  of the Riemann  zeta function  on $Q(s)$ to prove  that the\nintegrand of the last integral is in fact $(-1)^p Q(t)/\\pi^{2p+2t}.$ Start with the functional equation $$\\zeta(1-s) = \\frac{2}{2^s\\pi^s} \n\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) \\Gamma(s) \\zeta(s)$$ and substitute this into $Q(s)$ to obtain $$Q(s) = \n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^s}\\right) \n\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{s+2p}}\\right)\n\\frac{\\zeta(1-s) 2^s \\pi^s}{2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)}\n\\zeta(s+2p+1)\n\\\\ = \\frac{1}{2} \n(2^s-1) \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{s+2p}}\\right)\n\\pi^s \\frac{\\zeta(s+2p+1)}{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)}\n\\zeta(1-s).$$ Apply the functional equation again  (this time to $\\zeta(s+2p+1)$ ) to\nget $$Q(s) =  \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\pi^s}{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)}\n(2^s-1) \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{s+2p}}\\right)\n\\frac{2}{2^{-2p-s} \\pi^{-2p-s}}\n\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi (-2p-s)}{2}\\right)\n\\\\ \\times \\Gamma(-2p-s) \\zeta(-2p-s) \\zeta(1-s)\n\\\\ = \\frac{\\pi^s}{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)}\n(2^s-1) (2^{2p+s}-1)\n\\pi^{2p+s}\n(-1)^p \\cos\\left(\\frac{-\\pi s}{2}\\right)\n\\\\ \\times \\Gamma(-2p-s) \\zeta(-2p-s) \\zeta(1-s)$$ and  we finally get $$Q(s) =  (-1)^p \\pi^{2p+2s} (1-2^s) (1-2^{2p+s})\n\\Gamma(-2p-s) \\zeta(-2p-s) \\zeta(1-s)$$ thus proving the claim. Return to the remainder integral and re-write it as follows: $$(-1)^p \\frac{(x/\\pi)^{2p}}{2\\pi i} \n\\int_{3/2-i\\infty}^{3/2+i\\infty}\n(-1)^p \\pi^{2p+2t}\n\\left(1-2^{2p+t}\\right) \n\\left(1-2^t\\right)\n\\\\ \\times \\Gamma(-2p-t) \\zeta(-2p-t) \\zeta(1-t)\n(x/\\pi^2)^{t} dt.$$ so that  the fact of it being  a multiple of the  defining integral of $S(\\pi^2/x; p)$ becomes readily apparent. We have established the functional equation $$\\color{green}\n{S(x;p) =\n(2^{2p+1}-1) \n\\frac{(-1)^{p} B_{2p+2} \\pi^{2p+2}}{2 (2p+2)!} \\frac{1}{x}\n\\\\ +\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{q=0}^p\n(1-2^{2q+1}) \n(2^{2p-2q-1}-1)\n\\frac{(-1)^{p-q+1}}{(2q+1)!}\n\\frac{B_{2q+2} B_{2p-2q} \\pi^{2p-2q}}{(2p-2q)! (q+1)}\nx^{2q+1}\n\\\\ + (-1)^p \\left(\\frac{x}{\\pi}\\right)^{2p} S(\\pi^2/x;p).}$$ Now the value $x=\\pi$ is obviously special here (fixed  point) and we\nget for $p=2r+1$ with $r\\ge  0$ ( $p$ even yields a  Bernoulli number\nidentity) $$S(\\pi; 2r+1) = \n\\sum_{n\\ge 1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^{4r+3}}\n\\frac{e^{-n\\pi}}{1-e^{-2n\\pi}}\n= - \\frac{\\pi^{4r+3}}{4} \n(2^{4r+3}-1) \n\\frac{B_{4r+4}}{(4r+4)!}\n\\\\ + \\frac{\\pi^{4r+3}}{4} \\sum_{q=0}^{2r+1}\n(1-2^{2q+1}) \n(2^{4r+1-2q}-1)\n\\frac{(-1)^{q}}{(2q+1)!}\n\\frac{B_{2q+2} B_{4r+2-2q}}{(4r+2-2q)! (q+1)}.$$ We obtain a rational multiple of $\\pi^{4r+3}.$ Scale by two to get\nfor $$\\sum_{n\\ge 1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^3} \\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\pi n)}, \n\\quad \\sum_{n\\ge 1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^7} \\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\pi n)},\n\\\\ \\sum_{n\\ge 1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^{11}} \\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\pi n)}, \n\\quad \\sum_{n\\ge 1} \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^{15}} \\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\pi n)},\n\\quad \\ldots$$ the values $$\\bbox[5px,border:2px solid #00A000]{\n{\\frac {{\\pi }^{3}}{360}},\\quad\n{\\frac {13\\,{\\pi }^{7}}{453600}},\\quad\n{\\frac {4009\\,{\\pi }^{11}}{13621608000}},\\quad\n{\\frac {13739\\,{\\pi }^{15}}{4547140416000}},\\quad \\ldots}$$ These are dominated by the first term $$\\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\pi)}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand what the original problem is. The title mentions a Ramanujan sum involving sinh, and the question is about proving a specific sum equals π³/360.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the main goal is to prove the sum: ∑_{n≥1} (-1)^{n+1}/(n³ sinh(πn)) = π³/360. The user provided some context about possible methods like Poisson summation, residue theorem, Eisenstein series, etc., but those might be extra details. The example given in the instruction shows that the assumption part lists conditions applied to one object each. \n\nSo, I need to filter out the assumptions from the problem. The sum is over n starting from 1, each term involves (-1)^{n+1}, divided by n³ and sinh(πn). The problem is to prove the equality. But are there any hidden assumptions here? The example had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this problem, n is a positive integer since the sum is from n≥1, and the terms involve (-1)^{n+1} which alternates signs. However, the problem statement itself doesn't mention any specific conditions on n beyond being in the summation index, which by default is positive integers. The original problem states it's a classical result by Ramanujan, so maybe there are implicit assumptions like convergence of the series. But the user wants assumptions listed as per the problem's given conditions. \n\nWait, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. But in this case, the problem as stated in the question doesn't have any explicit conditions beyond the summation. The user just needs to prove the equality. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are simply that n is a positive integer. But in the example, the assumption listed was that n is an integer, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\". Maybe in this case, the only assumption is that the series converges, but that's usually part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the series definition. Let me check the example again: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted assumption listed n as an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the example might have been a mistake? Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check again. \n\nWait the original example problem is: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted assumption says n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait that can't be right. If the problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong. But the user provided that example, so maybe there's a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but in the actual task, I need to structure the problem correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo. But given that, maybe in this current problem, there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series definition. However, sinh(πn) is involved. For n being a positive integer, sinh(πn) is well-defined and non-zero, so maybe there are no specific assumptions needed. Therefore, the assumptions would just be that n is a positive integer. But the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, it was for every integer n, so the first assumption is redundant. Hmm. Maybe the example is flawed, but I need to follow the user's instruction. \n\nWait, perhaps the user's example is not from the same problem. Let me re-read the example. The example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Unless there was a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was different. Maybe the user intended to modify the problem. For example, perhaps the original problem was to prove that if n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the assumptions would make sense. But the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would make the assumptions in the formatted problem incorrect. \n\nThis is confusing. But since the user provided that example, I have to follow the structure, even if the example might have an error. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are that n is a positive integer. But the example shows that assumptions can be even if the problem says \"for every integer n\", they still list \"n is an integer\". So perhaps in this problem, even if n is a summation index starting at 1, we still list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption. So, the assumptions here would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- The series converges (but this is part of the problem statement),\n- Each term of the series is (-1)^{n+1}/(n³ sinh(πn)).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So for the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So in the current problem, the summation index n is a positive integer. That's one assumption. However, the problem is to prove the sum equals π³/360. Are there other assumptions? The problem mentions it's a classical result, so maybe there are no other explicit conditions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the example included multiple assumptions even if the problem didn't state them. Alternatively, maybe in the problem, the fact that the series is summed over n ≥ 1 is an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The summation is over all positive integers n.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is one line. So in this case, maybe:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∑_{n≥1} (-1)^{n+1}/(n³ sinh(πn)) = π³/360.\n\nBut in the example, the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem said for every integer n. So perhaps there's a discrepancy. However, given that the user's example included assumptions that might not be in the original problem, but the user might want to extract any conditions or properties from the problem. In the current problem, the series involves sinh(πn), which is defined for all real n, but since n is a summation index, it's implied to be positive integers. So the key assumption here is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should have that assumption. So the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: \nProve that \n$$\\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^3\\sinh(\\pi n)} = \\frac{\\pi^3}{360}.$$",
