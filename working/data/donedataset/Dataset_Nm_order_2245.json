    "AcceptedAnswer": "The basic idea behind most polylogarithmic integrals is integration by parts. Note that we have the indefinite integral, $$\\int\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x=\\frac{1}{1-x}+\\color{grey}{constant}.$$ And the derivative of the dilogarithm is of course: $$\\frac{d}{dx}\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(x\\right)}=-\\frac{\\ln{\\left(1-x\\right)}}{x}.$$ Thus, integration by parts can transform this polylog integral into an integral with just ordinary logarithms and rational functions, which can be evaluated by the usual methods such as partial fractions:: $$\\begin{align}\n\\int_{-1}^{0}\\frac{\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(x\\right)}}{(1-x)^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n&=\\left[\\frac{\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(x\\right)}}{1-x}\\right]_{-1}^{0}+\\int_{-1}^{0}\\frac{\\ln{\\left(1-x\\right)}}{x(1-x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(-1\\right)}}{2}+\\int_{-1}^{0}\\frac{\\ln{\\left(1-x\\right)}}{x(1-x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(-1\\right)}}{2}+\\int_{-1}^{0}\\frac{\\ln{\\left(1-x\\right)}}{x}\\,\\mathrm{d}x+\\int_{-1}^{0}\\frac{\\ln{\\left(1-x\\right)}}{1-x}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(-1\\right)}}{2}+\\left[-\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(x\\right)}\\right]_{-1}^{0}+\\left[-\\frac12\\ln^2{\\left(1-x\\right)}\\right]_{-1}^{0}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(-1\\right)}}{2}+\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(-1\\right)}+\\frac{\\ln^2{\\left(2\\right)}}{2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\operatorname{Li}_{2}{\\left(-1\\right)}}{2}+\\frac{\\ln^2{\\left(2\\right)}}{2}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\pi^2}{24}+\\frac{\\ln^2{\\left(2\\right)}}{2}.\\\\\n\\end{align}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to -1 of Li₂(x)/(1 - x)² dx equals π²/24 minus (ln²2)/2. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions the integral of the dilogarithm function Li₂(x) divided by (1 - x) squared, from 0 to -1. The assumptions here would relate to the properties of the functions involved and the limits of integration. \n\nLooking at the integral, the integrand is Li₂(x)/(1 - x)². The limits are from 0 to -1, which is a bit unusual since the lower limit is higher than the upper limit, but that's okay; it just means the integral is from -1 to 0 with a negative sign. However, the user wrote it as from 0 to -1, so I should note that as an assumption. \n\nNext, Li₂(x) is the dilogarithm function. The problem assumes that the reader knows the definition and properties of the dilogarithm, but maybe I need to state that Li₂(x) is the standard dilogarithm function. Also, the denominator is (1 - x) squared, so the integrand is defined as long as x ≠ 1, which is true in the interval from -1 to 0. So no issues with the denominator there. \n\nThe problem doesn't mention any specific conditions on the function or restrictions, but the integral is definite, so the assumptions should include the interval of integration and the functions involved. \n\nWait, the original problem in the example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The integral is taken from x = 0 to x = -1.\n2. The integrand is the dilogarithm function Li₂(x) divided by (1 - x)².\n3. Li₂(x) refers to the standard dilogarithm function.\n\nI think that's all. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions like convergence or specific branches, but since the user is asking for the proof, it's assumed that the integral converges and the function is defined in that interval. Maybe I should also include that Li₂(x) is the polylogarithm function of order 2, but perhaps that's redundant. \n\nWait, the example given in the original had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition. In this case, the integral's limits and the form of the integrand are the key assumptions. So yes, the three points I listed above. But maybe the third one is too much. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem says: \"Prove that the integral from 0 to -1 of Li₂(x)/(1 - x)^2 dx equals π²/24 - (ln²2)/2\". The user mentions they're not used to polylogarithms, but the problem itself just states the integral. The assumptions should capture the necessary conditions given in the problem. The problem doesn't mention anything about Li₂(x) beyond its standard definition, so perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The integral is evaluated from x = 0 to x = -1.\n2. The integrand is Li₂(x) divided by (1 - x)^2.\n3. Li₂(x) is the dilogarithm function.\n\nBut maybe the third point is implicit and the first two are the main ones. Wait, in the example, the problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem in the example didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, wait, the example given was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = 5^n(...) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was a typo? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so there should be no additional assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as an example. So perhaps in their formatting, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I should follow the user's example format.\n\nBut according to their example, they took the original problem which says \"for every integer n\" and in the formatted problem, they added an assumption \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that contradicts. If the original says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should only be \"n is an integer\", but in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error. Maybe the example was incorrectly formatted. But the user wants me to follow the example. So perhaps the user intended that the assumption includes all conditions, even those not explicitly stated but necessary? Wait, no. In the original example, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the user in the example mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\", but actually, the problem is to show divisibility by 91 for any integer n, so the correct assumption is only \"n is an integer\". But in their formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was a bad one. But regardless, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nSo going back to the current problem: The integral from 0 to -1 of Li₂(x)/(1 - x)^2 dx. The problem is to prove it equals π²/24 - (ln²2)/2. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to -1.\n- The integrand is Li₂(x)/(1 - x)^2.\n- Li₂(x) is the dilogarithm function.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions for the same object (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7), but in the original problem, n was any integer. So perhaps the example was incorrect, but I need to proceed.\n\nIn the current problem, perhaps the key assumption is the integral's limits and the definition of Li₂(x). Since the problem is to compute the integral, the assumptions are the structure of the integral. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken from 0 to -1,\nThe integrand is Li₂(x)/(1 - x)²,\nLi₂(x) is the dilogarithm function.\n\nBut maybe even more precise: each assumption should address only one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\nThe upper limit of integration is -1,\nThe integrand is Li₂(x) divided by (1 - x)²,\nLi₂(x) denotes the dilogarithm function.\n\nBut maybe splitting the integral limits into two separate assumptions. However, in the example, the integral was a single assumption. Wait, the example didn't have an integral, but a function A(n). The example's assumptions were on n. In this problem, the integral's limits are part of the problem statement, so they need to be listed as assumptions.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nAssumption 1: The integral is evaluated from x = 0 to x = -1.\n\nAssumption 2: The integrand is the function Li₂(x) divided by (1 - x)².\n\nAssumption 3: Li₂(x) is the dilogarithm function.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes the standard definition of the dilogarithm, then maybe the third assumption is redundant. However, since the user mentioned they're not used to polylogarithms, perhaps specifying that Li₂(x) is the standard dilogarithm is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to -1,\nThe integrand is Li₂(x)/(1 - x)²,\nLi₂(x) is the dilogarithm function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{-1} \\frac{\\operatorname{Li}_2(x)}{(1-x)^2} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi^2}{24} - \\frac{\\ln^2(2)}{2}\n$$\n\nYes, that seems to capture all the necessary elements. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The integral limits, the integrand, and the definition of Li₂(x).",
