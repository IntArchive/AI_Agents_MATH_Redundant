    "Content": "Let $a,b,c$ are non-negative numbers, such that $a+b+c = 3$. Prove that $\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\ge ab + bc + ca$ Here's my idea: $\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\ge ab + bc + ca$ $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\ge 2(ab + bc + ca)$ $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) - 2(ab + bc + ca) \\ge 0$ $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) - ((a+b+c)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\ge 0$ $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a+b+c)^2 \\ge 0$ $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\ge (a+b+c)^2$ $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\ge 3^2 = 9$ And I'm stuck here. I need to prove that: $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\ge (a+b+c)^2$ or $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\ge 3(a+b+c)$, because $a+b+c = 3$ In the first case using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality I prove that: $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(1+1+1) \\ge (a+b+c)^2$ $3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\ge (a+b+c)^2$ Now I need to prove that: $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\ge 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$ $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\ge 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$ $\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\ge a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ I need I don't know how to continue. In the second case I tried proving: $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\ge 2(a+b+c)$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\ge a+b+c$ Using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality I proved: $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(1+1+1) \\ge (a+b+c)^2$ $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(a+b+c) \\ge (a+b+c)^2$ $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\ge a+b+c$ But I can't find a way to prove that $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\ge 2(a+b+c)$ So please help me with this problem. P.S My initial idea, which is proving: $2(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\ge 3^2 = 9$ maybe isn't the right way to prove this inequality.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will use the following lemma (the proof below): $$2x \\geq x^2(3-x^2)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{ for any }\\ x \\geq 0. \\tag{$\\clubsuit$}$$ Start by multiplying our inequality by two $$2\\sqrt{a} +2\\sqrt{b} + 2\\sqrt{c} \\geq 2ab +2bc +2ca, \\tag{$\\spadesuit$}$$ and observe that $$2ab + 2bc + 2ca = a(b+c) + b(c+a) + c(b+c) = a(3-a) + b(3-b) + c(3-c)$$ and thus $(\\spadesuit)$ is equivalent to $$2\\sqrt{a} +2\\sqrt{b} + 2\\sqrt{c} \\geq a(3-a) + b(3-b) + c(3-c)$$ which can be obtained by summing up three applications of $(\\clubsuit)$ for $x$ equal to $\\sqrt{a}$, $\\sqrt{b}$ and $\\sqrt{c}$ respectively: \\begin{align}\n2\\sqrt{a} &\\geq a(3-a), \\\\\n2\\sqrt{b} &\\geq b(3-b), \\\\\n2\\sqrt{c} &\\geq c(3-c). \\\\\n\\end{align} $$\\tag*{$\\square$}$$ The lemma $$2x \\geq x^2(3-x^2) \\tag{$\\clubsuit$}$$ is true for any $x \\geq 0$ (and also any $x \\leq -2$) because $$2x - x^2(3-x^2) = (x-1)^2x(x+2)$$ is a polynomial with roots at $0$ and $-2$, a double root at $1$ and a positive coefficient at the largest degree, $x^4$. $\\hspace{60pt}$ I hope this helps ;-)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the problem by listing assumptions and then stating the problem clearly. The original question is about proving that the sum of square roots of a, b, c is greater than or equal to the sum of their pairwise products, given that a, b, c are non-negative and their sum is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem. The user wrote the title as \"Prove √a + √b + √c ≥ ab + bc + ca\" and in the question, they specify that a, b, c are non-negative with a + b + c = 3. So the key points here are the non-negativity of a, b, c and the condition that their sum is 3. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the variables a, b, c are each non-negative, and their sum is 3. So each of these should be separate assumptions. \n\nWait, the problem states \"a, b, c are non-negative numbers, such that a + b + c = 3\". So for assumptions, each of a, b, c is non-negative. But how to phrase that? The example had \"n is an integer\", so here maybe each variable is non-negative. But maybe the user wants each assumption on a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a non-negative number,\nb is a non-negative number,\nc is a non-negative number,\na + b + c = 3.\n\nBut wait, the original example for the divisibility problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, there are three variables, each non-negative, and their sum is 3. So perhaps each non-negativity is a separate assumption, and the sum is another. So four assumptions. But maybe the non-negativity can be grouped. Wait, in the example, each assumption is a single condition. The user said \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So \"a is non-negative\", \"b is non-negative\", \"c is non-negative\", and \"a + b + c = 3\". So four separate assumptions. That seems correct.\n\nSo the problem statement would then be \"Prove that √a + √b + √c ≥ ab + bc + ca\".\n\nI need to check if the user's example in the original problem included all necessary assumptions. For the first example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because in the original problem, the divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13) would require n to satisfy certain conditions. Wait, maybe the example given was from another problem? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, according to the user's instruction, the example is their previous work. So perhaps in that case, the problem was actually under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem statement might have had a different condition. But regardless, I should follow the user's example structure.\n\nSo in our current problem, the user's original problem states that a, b, c are non-negative numbers with a + b + c = 3, and the goal is to prove sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) >= ab + bc + ca.\n\nSo following the example structure, the assumptions should list each variable's non-negativity separately, then the sum condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a non-negative number,\nb is a non-negative number,\nc is a non-negative number,\na + b + c = 3.\n\nProblem: Prove that √a + √b + √c ≥ ab + bc + ca.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user's example included multiple assumptions, each on a separate line, so this should follow. The original problem's title and question both mention the variables being non-negative and their sum being 3, so those are the key assumptions. The rest of the user's question details their attempts, which we can ignore for the purpose of structuring the problem as per the given format.",
