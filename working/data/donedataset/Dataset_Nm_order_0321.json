    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let me state the result properly: Let $x=(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\in \\ell^q$ for some $q \\geq 1$. Then $$\\|x\\|_{\\infty} = \\lim_{p \\to \\infty} \\|x\\|_p. \\tag{1}$$ Note that $(1)$ fails, in general, not hold if $x=(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\notin \\ell^q$ for all $q \\geq 1$ (consider for instance $x_n := 1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.) Proof of the result: Since $$|x_k| \\leq \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} |x_j|^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}=\\|x\\|_p$$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $p \\geq 1$, we have $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\|x\\|_p$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the limit of the l^p norms of a sequence x is equal to the l^infinity norm. So, first, I need to recall the definitions. The l^p norm is the sum of |x_i|^p raised to 1/p, and the l^infinity norm is the supremum of |x_i|. \n\nHmm, the user mentioned they saw an answer for L^p spaces but didn't understand it. Since this is about sequence spaces (l^p), maybe the approach is similar but with sequences instead of functions. Let me think. For L^p spaces, as p approaches infinity, the essential supremum becomes the norm. But here, it's the supremum because we're dealing with sequences, not equivalence classes of functions.\n\nFirst, let's consider a sequence x in l^infinity. That means the supremum of |x_i| is finite. Now, for the l^p norm, as p increases, the term with the largest |x_i| will dominate the sum. For example, if the maximum |x_i| is M, then the sum would be roughly M^p times the number of terms equal to M, plus smaller terms. Taking the p-th root would then approach M as p goes to infinity.\n\nBut wait, in l^p spaces, sequences must have finite p-norms. However, if the sequence is in l^infinity, it might not be in l^p for all p. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the sequence is in all l^p spaces. Hmm, that might be an implicit assumption here. Because otherwise, the l^p norm might not be defined. So maybe the problem assumes that the sequence is in l^infinity, and perhaps also in some l^p space so that the norm is finite for some p. Or maybe they are considering the intersection of all l^p spaces with l^infinity? Not sure. The original problem statement just says \"if we are in a sequence space\", which is a bit vague. But I think the standard approach is to consider sequences where the supremum is finite (so l^infinity space) and also that they have finite l^p norms for all p, but maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that for any fixed sequence x in l^infinity, even if it's not in l^p for some p, but as p approaches infinity, the limit of the l^p norms (if they exist) would be the supremum. But actually, if x is not in l^p for some p, then the l^p norm would be infinite for all p beyond a certain point, but if x is in l^infinity, but maybe not in l^p for p < infinity. Wait, no: if x is in l^infinity, then |x_i| is bounded by M, but unless it's also in l^p, the sum of |x_i|^p might diverge. For example, take the constant sequence where every term is 1. Then the l^p norm is infinity for all p, but the l^infinity norm is 1. So in that case, the limit of l^p norms is infinity, which is not equal to the l^infinity norm. So the problem must be assuming that the sequence is in some space where the l^p norms are finite for sufficiently large p. Or perhaps the problem is only considering sequences with finitely many non-zero terms. But the question is about sequences indexed by natural numbers, so possibly infinite. Hmm, maybe the problem is missing an assumption that the sequence is in the space where the l^p norms exist for all p, or maybe that it's in c_0 or something. Wait, but the user didn't specify that. The original problem says \"if we are in a sequence space\", which is a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut looking at standard results, the limit of the l^p norms as p approaches infinity equals the l^infinity norm, provided that the sequence is in l^p for some p. Wait, maybe the standard result requires that the sequence is in l^p for all sufficiently large p, or that it's in l^infinity and the supremum is attained. Let me check. Suppose that the sequence has a maximum element, say M = sup |x_i|, and that for any epsilon > 0, there are only finitely many terms where |x_i| > M - epsilon. Then the sum of |x_i|^p would be dominated by the terms near M, and taking the p-th root would approach M. But if there are infinitely many terms approaching M, then the sum might not converge. Wait, if there are infinitely many terms equal to M, then the sum would be infinite for any p, unless M=0. So perhaps the problem assumes that the sequence is in l^infinity and that the l^p norms are finite for some p. Or maybe the problem is only considering sequences with finitely many non-zero terms. But the user didn't specify that. Hmm. Maybe the original problem has an implicit assumption that the sequence is in the space where the l^p norms are finite. Or perhaps the problem is only considering bounded sequences (i.e., l^infinity space) with finite l^p norms. Wait, but in l^infinity space, the sequences are bounded, but their l^p norms could still be infinite if, for example, the sequence doesn't decay to zero. For instance, the constant sequence 1 is in l^infinity but not in any l^p space for p < infinity. So in that case, the l^p norm is infinite for all p, so the limit is infinite, which is not equal to the l^infinity norm. Therefore, the problem must be making an implicit assumption that the sequence is in some space where the l^p norms are finite for all p, or at least for p approaching infinity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the intersection of l^p spaces with l^infinity, but that's not standard. Alternatively, the problem might be missing an assumption that the sequence has finite support (i.e., only finitely many non-zero terms), but the user didn't mention that. However, in the example given in the problem statement, the user's original example didn't mention that n is divisible by 7 until the formatted version. So perhaps in this case, the answerer needs to filter out the unnecessary information and list the assumptions properly. \n\nLooking back at the original question on Math Stack Exchange: \"If we are in a sequence space, then the l^p-norm of the sequence x = (x_i) is (sum |x_i|^p)^(1/p). The l^infty norm is sup |x_i|. Prove that the limit of the l^p norms is the l^infty norm.\" The user is asking for a proof for sequence spaces, and mentions they didn't understand the L^p answer. So the key here is to realize that the sequence space in question needs to have the property that the l^p norm is finite for all p (or at least as p approaches infinity). But in standard cases, sequences in l^infinity may not be in l^p. Therefore, perhaps the problem implicitly assumes that the sequence is in c_0 (the space of sequences converging to zero) but that's not necessarily true. Wait, no, c_0 is a subspace of l^infinity where the limit of x_i is zero. But even in c_0, a sequence can have infinitely many non-zero terms, so the l^p norm could still be infinite. For example, x_i = 1/i is in c_0, but its l^p norm is finite only if p > 1. So if we take p approaching infinity, the l^p norm would tend to the supremum, which is 1 (the first term). Wait, but in that case, the supremum is 1, and the l^p norm for x_i = 1/i would be (sum_{i=1}^\\infty (1/i)^p )^(1/p). For p approaching infinity, each term (1/i)^p tends to zero except for i=1, which is 1. So the sum tends to 1, and the p-th root of 1 is 1, which matches the supremum. So even if the sequence is in c_0, as long as the supremum is achieved at some term (here, the first term), then the limit of the l^p norms is the supremum. \n\nBut if the supremum is not achieved, like if x_i = 1 - 1/i, then the supremum is 1, but each term is less than 1. However, as p approaches infinity, the maximum term would be the one closest to 1, say x_n where n is large. But in that case, the sum would be dominated by terms approaching 1. Wait, but if the supremum is 1 but not achieved, then for any epsilon > 0, there exists a term x_i such that |x_i| > 1 - epsilon. Then, the sum would include at least one term (1 - epsilon)^p, and the rest are less than or equal to 1. So the sum is at least (1 - epsilon)^p. Taking the p-th root, we get at least (1 - epsilon). As p approaches infinity, the sum is dominated by the largest term, so the limit would be 1, which is the supremum. So even if the supremum is not attained, the limit of the l^p norms is still the supremum. \n\nHowever, this relies on the fact that the l^p norms are finite for all p. If the sequence is in l^infinity but not in any l^p space, then the l^p norm would be infinite, and the limit would be infinite, which doesn't match the supremum. Therefore, the problem must assume that the sequence is in l^p for all p >= some p0, or that the sequence has finite l^p norms as p approaches infinity. But how to phrase that as an assumption? \n\nLooking back at the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem statement didn't mention that. So perhaps in that case, the user had to infer the assumption. Similarly, here, perhaps the key assumption is that the sequence is in l^infinity and that the l^p norms are finite for sufficiently large p. But how to state that? Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the sequence has finite support (only finitely many non-zero terms), which would ensure that the l^p norm is finite for all p. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering sequences for which the limit exists, which would implicitly require that the l^p norms are finite for large enough p. However, in standard mathematical exposition, when proving that lim_{p->infty} ||x||_p = ||x||_infty, the usual assumption is that x is in l^infty and that x has finite support, or that x is such that ||x||_p is finite for all p. However, in many textbooks, this result is stated for functions in L^infty, but for sequences, the analogous result holds under the assumption that the sequence is in l^infty and that the l^p norms are finite for large p. \n\nBut perhaps the problem assumes that the sequence has at least one element with |x_i| equal to the supremum. Or maybe it's not necessary. As shown earlier, even if the supremum is not attained, the limit still holds as long as the l^p norms are finite. \n\nWait, let's consider an example. Take the sequence x = (1 - 1/i)_{i=1}^\\infty. The supremum is 1, but no term is equal to 1. The l^p norm is (sum_{i=1}^\\infty (1 - 1/i)^p )^{1/p}. As p approaches infinity, each term (1 - 1/i)^p tends to 0 for each fixed i, except that for any epsilon > 0, there exists an i such that 1 - 1/i > 1 - epsilon, so for large i, (1 - 1/i)^p is approximately (1 - epsilon)^p. But since there are infinitely many such terms, the sum might still diverge. Wait, no, for any fixed p, the terms (1 - 1/i)^p ~ e^{-p/i} for large i. But sum_{i=1}^\\infty e^{-p/i} diverges because for large i, e^{-p/i} ≈ 1 - p/i, and sum 1/i diverges. Therefore, the sum would actually diverge for any p, meaning the l^p norm is infinite for all p. Therefore, in this case, the l^p norm is infinite, so the limit is infinite, which does not equal the supremum of 1. Hence, this example shows that the problem's conclusion does not hold unless there is an additional assumption. \n\nTherefore, the key assumption here is that the sequence x is such that ||x||_p is finite for sufficiently large p. This would be true if, for example, the sequence has only finitely many non-zero terms (finite support), or if the sequence decays rapidly enough (e.g., in l^p for some p). However, in the problem statement, the user does not mention any such assumptions. Hence, when structuring the problem according to the required format, we need to list the necessary assumptions explicitly. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. The sequence x = (x_i) is an element of a sequence space where the l^p norm is finite for all p >= 1.\n2. The supremum of |x_i| is finite (i.e., x is in l^infinity).\n3. Alternatively, if we consider that the problem implicitly assumes the standard result, then the main assumption is that the sequence is in l^infinity and that the l^p norms are finite for all p. However, in the problem statement, the user just says \"if we are in a sequence space\", which is vague. \n\nWait, the problem says \"if we are in a sequence space\", so perhaps the key assumption is that we are working within a sequence space where the l^p norms are defined (i.e., finite). Therefore, the assumption would be that the sequence x is such that for all p >= 1, the l^p norm ||x||_p is finite. Alternatively, that the sequence is in the intersection of all l^p spaces. \n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. So maybe the assistant needs to infer necessary assumptions that were missing in the original problem but are required for the statement to hold. In the original problem here, the statement that lim_{p->infty} ||x||_p = ||x||_infty holds under the assumption that x is in l^infinity and that x is in l^p for some p. However, if x is in l^infinity, then for p >= 1, if x is in l^p, then ||x||_p <= ||x||_infty * (number of non-zero terms)^{1/p}. Wait, no, if there are infinitely many non-zero terms, that doesn't help. \n\nAlternatively, if x is in l^p for some p, then for q > p, ||x||_q <= ||x||_p (by the decreasing nature of l^p norms). So if x is in l^p for some p, then for all q >= p, ||x||_q is finite. Therefore, the assumption that x is in l^p for some p would suffice to ensure that ||x||_q is finite for all q >= p. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a sequence in l^infinity (i.e., sup |x_i| < infinity).\n2. There exists some p0 >= 1 such that x is in l^{p0} (i.e., sum |x_i|^{p0} < infinity).\n\nWith these two assumptions, the limit as p approaches infinity of ||x||_p equals ||x||_infty. \n\nHowever, the original problem statement does not mention these assumptions. Therefore, when formatting the problem according to the user's instructions, we need to list these assumptions explicitly. \n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a sequence of real or complex numbers,\n- The supremum of |x_i| over i in N is finite,\n- There exists p0 >= 1 such that the sum of |x_i|^{p0} over i=1 to infinity is finite.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"if we are in a sequence space\", which might already imply that the l^p norms are defined (i.e., finite). So perhaps the assumption is that x is an element of a sequence space where the l^p norm is finite for all p >= 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are just that x is in l^infty and that the limit is being taken as p approaches infinity. However, without x being in some l^p space, the norms might be infinite. \n\nGiven that the user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem (divisible by 7), perhaps here we need to infer that the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence x is such that the l^p norm is finite for all sufficiently large p.\n\nBut how to state that concisely? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering sequences with finite support, which would automatically have finite l^p norms. But the problem doesn't specify that. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but knowing the standard result in analysis, the usual assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a bounded sequence (i.e., in l^infty).\n2. x has finite l^p norm for some p (which ensures that for all q >= p, the l^q norm is finite).\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a sequence of real or complex numbers,\nThe supremum of |x_i| over i ∈ ℕ is finite,\nThere exists p₀ ≥ 1 such that the sum of |x_i|^p₀ from i=1 to ∞ is finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of the l^p-norms of x as p approaches infinity equals the l^∞-norm of x.\n\nBut perhaps the third assumption can be rephrased as \"x belongs to l^{p} space for some p ≥ 1\". However, the user's example lists each assumption on a separate line, addressing one property per line. So, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a sequence of real numbers,\nThe supremum of |x_i| over i ∈ ℕ is finite,\nThere exists p₀ ≥ 1 such that ∑_{i=1}^∞ |x_i|^{p₀} is finite.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the limit equals the supremum. However, in standard proofs, the key steps are:\n\n1. Show that lim sup_{p→∞} ||x||_p ≤ ||x||_∞.\n2. Show that lim inf_{p→∞} ||x||_p ≥ ||x||_∞.\n\nFor the first inequality, note that |x_i| ≤ ||x||_∞ for all i, so sum |x_i|^p ≤ ||x||_∞^p * N, where N is the number of terms. But if there are infinitely many terms, this doesn't help. Wait, no. If there are infinitely many terms, but x is in l^{p₀}, then for p ≥ p₀, ||x||_p ≤ ||x||_{p₀} (since l^p norms decrease as p increases). However, this only holds if the measure space has finite total measure, which isn't the case here. Wait, in sequence spaces, the measure is counting measure, which is infinite. Therefore, l^p spaces get smaller as p increases. So if x is in l^{p₀}, then for p ≥ p₀, ||x||_p ≤ ||x||_{p₀}. But this doesn't directly help with the limit. \n\nBut the key idea is that if x is in l^{p₀}, then for p ≥ p₀, ||x||_p is finite. Then, to show lim_{p→∞} ||x||_p = ||x||_∞.\n\nThe proof typically involves taking M = ||x||_∞. For any ε > 0, there exists an i such that |x_i| > M - ε. Then, ||x||_p ≥ |x_i| > M - ε. On the other hand, ||x||_p ≤ (sum_{i=1}^\\infty |x_i|^p)^{1/p} ≤ M * (sum_{i=1}^\\infty (|x_i|/M)^p)^{1/p}. Since |x_i|/M ≤ 1, and for at least one term, it's equal to 1. But if there are infinitely many terms with |x_i| close to M, the sum might diverge. However, if x is in l^{p₀}, then for p ≥ p₀, the tail of the sum is controlled. \n\nActually, if x is in l^{p₀}, then for p ≥ p₀, the sum sum |x_i|^p converges. Therefore, for such p, we can write sum |x_i|^p = sum_{|x_i| > M - ε} |x_i|^p + sum_{|x_i| ≤ M - ε} |x_i|^p. The second sum can be bounded by (M - ε)^p * N, where N is the number of terms, but N could be infinite. Wait, but since x is in l^{p₀}, and |x_i| ≤ M, then for p ≥ p₀, sum |x_i|^p = sum |x_i|^{p₀} * |x_i|^{p - p₀} ≤ M^{p - p₀} sum |x_i|^{p₀} < ∞. Therefore, the sum converges. \n\nThus, with the assumption that x is in l^{p₀} for some p₀, the sum converges for all p ≥ p₀. Then, the limit can be taken. \n\nTherefore, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a sequence of real or complex numbers.\n2. The supremum of |x_i| over i is finite (i.e., x ∈ l^∞).\n3. There exists p₀ ≥ 1 such that the sum of |x_i|^{p₀} is finite (i.e., x ∈ l^{p₀}).\n\nThese ensure that for p ≥ p₀, ||x||_p is finite, and the limit can be considered. \n\nHowever, the original problem statement does not mention these assumptions explicitly. Therefore, following the user's example where they added an assumption (n divisible by 7) not present in the original problem, here we must infer and list the necessary assumptions for the problem to hold. \n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a sequence of real numbers,\nThe supremum of |x_i| over i ∈ ℕ is finite,\nThere exists p₀ ≥ 1 such that ∑_{i=1}^∞ |x_i|^{p₀} converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of the l^p-norms of x as p approaches infinity equals the l^∞-norm of x.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to make it more concise, since the problem mentions \"sequence space\", which might implicitly assume that the l^p norms are defined, but the key is to ensure that the sum converges for some p. \n\nBut in the user's example, they transformed the original problem's assumption (for every integer n) into \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Here, the original problem says \"if we are in a sequence space\", so maybe the assumptions are that we're working in a sequence space where the l^p norms are defined (i.e., x is in l^p for all p), but that might not be standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the sequence has finite support, which is a common assumption in such proofs to avoid dealing with infinite sums. But the problem doesn't specify that. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but based on standard mathematical practice, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a sequence in l^∞.\n2. x is in l^p for some p ≥ 1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a sequence of real numbers,\nx is an element of l^∞,\nx is an element of l^p for some p ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of the l^p-norms of x as p approaches infinity equals the l^∞-norm of x.\n\nBut in the user's example, each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.
