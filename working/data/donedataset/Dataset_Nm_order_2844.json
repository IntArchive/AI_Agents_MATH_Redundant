    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose it were true.  What could the functions possibly be? Let $f(x) = g(x) + h(x)$ where $g$ is even and $h$ is odd. Then $f(-x) = g(x) - h(x)$ And $f(x)+f(-x) = 2g(x)$.  and so $g(x) = \\frac {f(x) + f(-x)}2$. The is indeed an even function that will work, and is apparently a unique such even function. If we can verify that $h(x) =f(x) - g(x)$ is odd we will have found that not only is this possible, but we will have found a unique odd/even pair for which this can be true. Now $h(x)= f(x) - g(x) = f(x) - \\frac {f(x) + f(-x)}2 = \\frac {f(x) - f(-x)}2$ is indeed an odd function. So we are done: $f(x) = g(x) + h(x)$ where $g$ is even and $h$ is odd is uniquely expressed when $g(x) = \\frac {f(x) + f(-x)}2$ and $h(x) = \\frac {f(x) - f(-x)}2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that any function can be written as the sum of an even function and an odd function. First, I need to recall the definitions of even and odd functions. An even function satisfies f(x) = f(-x) for all x in its domain, and an odd function satisfies f(x) = -f(-x). \n\nThe problem is asking to show that for any function f, there exist an even function g and an odd function h such that f(x) = g(x) + h(x). The key here is to figure out how to construct g and h from f. \n\nI remember that there's a standard technique where you can express f(x) as the sum of its even and odd parts. Let me think. If we take f(x) and f(-x), maybe we can combine them in some way. For example, adding f(x) and f(-x) might give something even, and subtracting them might give something odd. \n\nLet's test this. Suppose we define g(x) = [f(x) + f(-x)] / 2. Then h(x) could be [f(x) - f(-x)] / 2. Let's check if g is even. Replace x with -x: g(-x) = [f(-x) + f(x)] / 2 = g(x). Yes, that works. Similarly, h(-x) = [f(-x) - f(x)] / 2 = -h(x), so h is odd. Then f(x) = g(x) + h(x) because when you add those two expressions, the f(-x) terms cancel out, leaving f(x).\n\nSo the main idea is to decompose f into these two parts. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the function f, so the assumptions would be that f is a function from a domain (probably real numbers) where for every x, -x is also in the domain (to ensure that f(-x) is defined). Also, the domain needs to be symmetric about the origin for the even and odd decomposition to make sense. \n\nWait, the original problem statement just says \"any function\". But technically, the domain has to be symmetric; otherwise, f(-x) might not be defined. So in the assumptions, I should note that the domain of the function is symmetric about the origin. For example, if the domain is all real numbers, that's symmetric. If it's an interval like [-a, a], that's also symmetric. But if the domain is something like [0, ∞), then you can't define f(-x) for x > 0, so the decomposition wouldn't work. Therefore, the assumption should include that the domain of f is symmetric about the origin.\n\nSo the assumptions would be: f is a function with a domain symmetric about the origin. Then the problem is to prove that f can be written as the sum of an even function and an odd function.\n\nLet me check the example given in the problem. The example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. In the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the key assumptions are about the function's domain and maybe that it's a real function. \n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function,\nThe domain of f is symmetric about the origin.\n\nProblem:\nProve that any function can be written as the sum of an even function and an odd function.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"any function\", but the assumptions should specify the conditions needed for the statement to hold. So the user's question might not mention the domain, so in the formatted problem, we need to include the necessary assumptions. Hence, the assumption that the domain is symmetric is crucial. Otherwise, the statement isn't true. Therefore, the formatted problem would list that assumption.\n\nAnother possible assumption is that f is defined for all real numbers, but that's a specific case of a symmetric domain. So the more general assumption is that the domain is symmetric.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function,\nThe domain of f is symmetric about the origin.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f can be written as the sum of an even function and an odd function.\n\nYes, that seems right. The problem statement in the user's example didn't mention the domain, but the correct answer requires that assumption. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions include the domain being symmetric. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property (the function existing, and the domain's symmetry).",
