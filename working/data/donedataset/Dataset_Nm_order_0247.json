    "Content": "Update : a full solution to the recursion below has now been found, and it is discussed here . If $z_n < 2y_n$ then $y_{n+1} = 4y_n - 2z_n$ $z_{n+1} = 2z_n + 3$ Else $y_{n+1} = 4y_n$ $z_{n+1} = 2 z_n - 1$ Consider the following limit: $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\left(z_{n+1} - \\sum_{k=1}^n z_k\\right) \\tag{$\\star$}$$ The limit may or may not exist, and it may or may not depend on the initial conditions. Let us assume that the initial values $y_1$ and $z_1$ are strictly positive integers. Question : If $y_1 \\neq 2 z_1$ and $2y_1 \\neq z_1$ , is it true that $(\\star)$ is always $1$ , and otherwise the limit is always $3$ ? Now let's the fun begin... Let $d_n=\\frac14(z_n-2z_{n-1}+1)$ . The sequence $d_n$ represents the binary digits of some unknown number $x$ , a number that depends on the initial conditions. It turns out that if $y_1=2, z_1=5$ then that number is $x=\\sqrt{2}$ . You may ask: so what? Here is where it becomes fascinating: If you answer my question about the limit converging to $1$ , say for $y_1=2, z_1=5$ , then you proved that exactly 50% of the binary digits of $\\sqrt{2}$ are zero. An article about this recursion (with connection to the digits distribution) can be found here . An application to the gaming industry can be found in section 2.1 in the following article . The source code I used in my computations is accessible here (Perl code using the Bignum library for exact arithmetic.) I can produce a large number of $z_n$ on request, for those interested and not familiar with high precision computing. Hints and expectations The case with the limit converging towards $1$ , I call it the standard case . At this point, the result about the limit is still a conjecture. It is based on the fact that for a number such as $\\sqrt{2}$ , the distribution of the binary digits is believed to be uniform on $\\{0,1\\}$ . Generally speaking, the limit is equal to $4p-1$ where $p$ is the proportion of binary digits equal to one in the number $x$ in question: this fact is easy to prove, almost trivial, as the formula in the limit was built with that goal in mind. Also note that in the standard case, you can never have $y_n = 2z_n$ or $2y_n = z_n$ at any iteration $n$ , otherwise, it would force the convergence towards $3$ according to this conjecture, and imply that $x$ is rational. Also, if the limit, rather than being $1$ was (say) $1.2$ , it would imply that 55% of the binary digits of $\\sqrt{2}$ are equal to one. Even proving (in the standard case) that the limit is strictly above $-1$ or strictly below $3$ would be a spectacular discovery: it would imply that the proportion of digits of $\\sqrt{2}$ equal to zero is strictly positive (that is, it does not tend to zero as you look at longer and longer sequences of successive digits.) To this day, whether this fact is true or not remains a mystery. I don't know if proving my conjecture is easy, extremely difficult, or impossible to prove or disprove. But I will accept any answer that brings some light to help answer my question, even if it is just a reference to relevant, very interesting previous work. Also, insights about the case where $y_1$ or $z_1$ are not integers, are welcome: for the few cases I tested so far, the limit was equal to $1$ , unless $y_1=2z_1$ or $2y_1 = z_1$ , but convergence can be slow when we are close to $y_1=2z_1$ or $2y_1 = z_1$ . Below is a chart showing convergence to $1$ (relatively slow, of the order $1/\\sqrt{n}$ just like for the central limit theorem - not a coincidence - and chaotic) using $y_1=2, z_1=5$ . The X-axis represents $n$ , the number of iterations. The convergence is much faster when the limit is $3$ . Suggested path to solve this problem One way to handle this problem is to consider the sequence $d_n$ of digits of $x$ as a realization of an ergodic stochastic process. Such processes have an equilibrium distribution, called attractor in chaos theory, even though the dynamical system considered here is entirely deterministic. See my article on the theory of randomness, here , and my book Applied Stochastic Processes, Chaos Modeling, and Probabilistic Properties of Numeration Systems , here . The equilibrium distribution is solution to a stochastic integral equation. Here we are dealing with discrete values, and with a discrete stochastic equation that seems to only have two solutions (the standard case, and the other one.)  Assume that the probability (at any iteration $n$ ) for $d_n$ to be equal to one, is $p$ . At equilibrium, the probability for $d_{n+1}$ to be equal to one, must also be $p$ . This yields a stochastic equation, based on the recurrence system mentioned in the introduction, and the only unknown is $p$ . In order for the equilibrium to hold (that is, solving this equation with respect to $p$ ) must yield $p=1/2$ in the standard case. Update: One thing that could also help is looking at what happens with non-integer initial values. For instance, $y_1 \\rightarrow 2, z_1 \\rightarrow 5$ . I did notice during this experiment that $y_1=1.2, z=5.3$ leads to the non standard case, with the limit converging to $3$ and $x$ being a rational number. So the definition of the standard case needs some refinement (at least to handle non-integer initial values) and examples leading to the non-standard case (though rare) may be more numerous than initially thought. Another interesting chart Here I try to build a second order approximation for the limit. Let $$L(n)= \\frac{1}{n}\\left(z_{n+1} - \\sum_{k=1}^n z_k\\right) \\tag{$\\star$}$$ I am interested in the error $E(n) = \\sqrt{n}\\cdot \\Big(L(n)-1\\Big)$ . In a traditional problem, you would expect $E(n)$ to tend to a constant as $n \\rightarrow\\infty$ . Not here, the error behaves like a Brownian motion, again, just like in the central limit theorem. Yet the system is fully deterministic here. Note that I used $y(1)=2, z(1)=5$ to produce the chart below. While I did not test it, I would expect that the same Brownian behavior occurs regardless of the initial conditions, as long as we are dealing with the standard case. Also, if you look closely at the above chart, I believe it is NOT a true Brownian motion. It is too regular, and most importantly, the error seems to be bounded. The (apparently) bounded error, together with the non-dependence on the initial conditions (yet to be verified) for the probabilistic behavior, makes me think that this problem, after all, might be solvable. And maybe another way to sole this problem is to get good enough asymptotic expansions for $y_n$ and $z_n$ . Note The recursion mentioned here is identical to the one featured in section 2.1 in this article after the change of variable $z_n = 4x_n + 1$ . An additional change of variables, $w_n=z_n - 2y_n$ , could prove useful. A different approach If the goal is to prove that that binary digits of $\\sqrt{2}$ are uniformly distributed, a different approach is as follows. Consider the sequence $q_k=2^{-\\{ k \\log_2 3 \\}}$ where the brackets represent the fractional part function. The number $q_k$ is rational, it has a period of $2 \\cdot 3^{k-1}$ in its binary expansion, and the proportion of digits equal to zero is always 50%. The median of $\\{q_1, q_2, \\cdots q_n\\}$ tends to $\\sqrt{2}/2$ and if $n$ is odd, it is equal to one of the $q_k (1\\leq k\\leq n$ ): it is the middle value when these numbers are ordered. Thus the proportion of zero in the median is always exactly 50% if $n$ is odd. But is this also true at the limit as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ ? Not necessarily, this is not the case if you consider the minimum or the maximum, instead of the median. So it is more complicated: some $q_k$ (infinitely many) must be removed to guarantee this fact, and they must be chosen carefully so as to not change the value of the limiting median. One way to do this successfully is as follows. Keep only those $q_k$ that satisfy $|p_m(q_k) - \\frac{1}{2}| < \\frac{C}{\\log m}$ for all $m=2,3, \\cdots, \\lfloor \\log k\\rfloor$ where $p_m(\\alpha)$ is the proportion of digits of $\\alpha$ that are equal to 1 among the first $m$ digits, and $C$ is a constant. Would this eventually eliminate $\\sqrt{2}/2$ ? Probably not. Would this impact the limiting value of the median? Probably not. But these are extremely challenging questions. It is probably not hard to compute the exact proportion of $q_k$ that you eliminated by doing so. Yet it is not impossible that $\\sqrt{2}/2$ can't be reached anymore after applying this thinning process, but only a neighboring irrational that shares (say) the same first $10^{10,000}$ digits. Update: If the $q_k$ being removed were evenly spread (they may not), we are left with the same limit distribution (that of $2^{-X}$ where $X$ is uniform on $[0, 1]$ ). Thus its median $\\sqrt{2}/2$ would stay the same. Or perhaps, after removing the set $S$ all those $q_k$ , the median $M_n$ computed on $\\{q_1,\\cdots,q_n\\} \\setminus S$ still satisfies $|M_n - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}|<\\frac{D}{\\log n}$ , where $D$ is a constant. That would be enough to prove the main result. If you are only interested in finding a classic math constant $\\alpha$ with 50% zeros and 50% ones in its binary expansion, then replace the median $M_n$ by the closest number to $\\alpha$ among $\\{ q_1, \\cdots, q_n\\}$ . An example is $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2 \\log 2}$ . This number is the expectation of the distribution in question, instead of the median. One interesting fact related to this number is the following. The $m$ - th digit of $q_k$ averaged over all $k=1,2,\\cdots$ is denoted as $\\mu_m$ . Its exact value is known and discussed in a previous MST question ( here ). For $m>1$ , the sequence $\\mu_m$ is strictly increasing and converges exponentially fast to $\\frac{1}{2}$ . An immediate consequence of the definition of $\\mu_m$ is that $$\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\mu_m}{2^m} = \\frac{1}{2\\log 2}.$$ Also, less obvious to prove but not difficult: we have $\\mu_1=1$ and for $m>1$ , we have: $$\\mu_m = \\frac{1}{\\log 2}\\cdot\\log \\frac{2^{2^{m-1}} \\cdot (2^{m-1})!^3 }{(2^{m-2})!^2 \\cdot (2^m)!}  .$$ More on this in my next article. Conclusions and next steps It looks like $\\sqrt{n}\\cdot\\Big(L(n) - 1\\Big) = O(1)$ . This is enough to prove the main result in this discussion, but this asymptotic relationship has yet to be proved (or disproved). A weaker result, possibly easier to prove, is the following: $(\\log n) \\cdot \\Big(L(n) - 1\\Big) = o(1)$ . This is also enough to prove the main result. See chart below illustrating this conjecture. Another approach discussed in the section A different approach , does not seem to be easier. A related question is whether or not, for two irrational numbers $\\alpha, \\beta$ linearly independent on the set of rational numbers, the correlation between the digits of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in base $b$ is zero. To prove this, it suffices to prove that the sequences $\\{ b^n\\alpha\\}$ and $\\{ b^n\\beta\\}$ are not correlated. It was proved that this was true for the sequences $\\{ n\\alpha\\}$ and $\\{ n\\beta\\}$ , see here . Unfortunately, this does not help. Here the brackets represent the fractional part function. But this epitomizes the issue that we are dealing with here. If $\\alpha$ is irrational, then $\\{n\\alpha\\}$ (sometimes called $n \\alpha \\mbox{ modulo } 1$ ) is equidistributed, regardless of $\\alpha$ (irrational). But $\\{b^n\\alpha\\}$ is equidistributed only for almost all irrational numbers. The first sequence is sometimes referred to as a universally good averaging sequence , while the latter is termed a universally bad averaging sequence : see this Wikipedia entry . A weaker conjecture is the following: infinitely many irrational numbers $\\sqrt{r}$ with $r$ a rational number, have 50% zeros and 50% ones in their binary expansion. You might be able to prove it without being able to name a single of these numbers satisfying this property (I tried and failed so far; it is probably still a mystery today.) Finally, if you are interested to see how chaotic the behavior of non-normal numbers is (contrasted with supposedly normal numbers such as $\\sqrt{2}$ ), read my recent MSE discussion, here . It gives some nice insights about what makes a number such as $\\sqrt{2}, \\pi, e$ or $\\log 2$ stand out. Update The relation $\\sqrt{n}\\cdot\\Big(L(n) - 1\\Big) = O(1)$ is a direct consequence of the Berry-Essen theorem , a refinement of the central limit theorem that applies in this case. It would be true here if the digits of (say) $\\sqrt{2}$ were i.i.d. with a Bernouilli distribution of parameter $p=\\frac{1}{2}$ , as they appear to be. Thus proving this asymptotic result for $\\sqrt{2}$ would be very difficult at best, impossible at worst. But a weaker result might be reachable. Along the same lines, see a new question (with answer) that I posted recently on MSE, here , and also here . It shows what would happen if $\\sqrt{2}$ was a well-behaved but non-normal number, say with 75% of its digits equal to $1$ . Update #2 I wrote an article based on this question and some other related questions, You can read here .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I doubt that this way of expression/equation is gonna bring you much further. Based on the answer to your other question we can relate the values of $z_n$ to the numbers $p_n$ , which express as a series of binary fractions with increasingly more digits (where $n$ referes to the number of binary digits). That is: $$p_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n a_n 2^{-n}$$ where $a_n$ are the binary digits of the root that is being estimated. Your $z_n$ can be related to this and have the value: $$z_n - 1 = p_n 2^{n+1}$$ The term $z_n$ is more or less the estimate with increasingly more binary digits multiplied by an increasing power of two. Then this sum of $z_n$ (in your limit) can be seen visually/intuitive by putting it into a triangular form (algebraically you can see it as a double sum like, $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^i $ where you reverse the order/direction) $$\\begin{array}{}\n p_0  & = & a_0 \\frac{1}{1} \\\\\n p_1  & = & a_0 \\frac{1}{1} &+& a_1 \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n p_2  & = & a_0 \\frac{1}{1} &+& a_1 \\frac{1}{2} &+& a_2 \\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n p_3  & = & a_0 \\frac{1}{1} &+& a_1 \\frac{1}{2} &+& a_2 \\frac{1}{4} &+& a_3 \\frac{1}{8} \\\\\n p_4  & = & a_0 \\frac{1}{1} &+& a_1 \\frac{1}{2} &+& a_2 \\frac{1}{4} &+& a_3 \\frac{1}{8} &+& a_4 \\frac{1}{16}\\\\\n \\end{array}$$ in terms of $z_i-1$ $$\\begin{array}{r}\n z_0 -1  & = & a_0 \\frac{1}{1} \\\\\n z_1 -1  & = & a_0 \\frac{2}{1} &+& a_1 \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n z_2 -1  & = & a_0 \\frac{4}{1} &+& a_1 \\frac{4}{2} &+& a_2 \\frac{4}{4}\\\\\n z_3 -1  & = & a_0 \\frac{8}{1} &+& a_1 \\frac{8}{2} &+& a_2 \\frac{8}{4} &+& a_3 \\frac{8}{8} \\\\\n z_4 -1  & = & a_0 \\frac{16}{1} &+& a_1 \\frac{16}{2} &+& a_2 \\frac{16}{4} &+& a_3 \\frac{16}{8} &+& a_4 \\frac{16}{16} & \\\\\n\\hline \n \\sum_{k=0}^{4} z_k -1  & = & a_0 (32-1) &+& a_1 (16-1) &+& a_2 (8-1) &+& a_3 (4-1) &+& a_4 (2-1)  \\\\\n \\end{array}$$ which compares with $$z_5 - 1 =  a_0 32 + a_1 16 + a_2 8 + a_3 4 + a_4 2 + a_5 $$ So this is a different way to see why the difference $(z_n -1) - \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (z_k -1) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k $ I have written it down in this graphical form. Instead of using summation terms which I sometimes find a bit awkward. I hope the idea is clear (possibly I may have made some mistakes with counting the multiples of two, but the basic idea is that your $z_n$ is a power of $p_n$ and you can arrange them like above). Your search for the limit with some terms $z_n$ is very directly related to a more trivial computation of $p_n$ but just multiplied with a factor $2^n$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into a specific format. The example provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the original problem carefully. The question is about a recursion involving sequences y_n and z_n with specific update rules. The main problem is about determining whether a certain limit (denoted as (⋆)) is always 1 or 3 depending on the initial conditions y₁ and z₁. The user also mentions that if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, the limit should be 1; otherwise, it's 3. They assume y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\n\nSo, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers. Then, there are two conditions given for the limit: if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, the limit is conjectured to be 1. Otherwise, it's 3. These need to be separate assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. Here, the initial values are y₁ and z₁, which are strictly positive integers. Then, the conditions are y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁. Each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that if either y₁ = 2z₁ or 2y₁ = z₁, the limit is 3. So, the assumptions should include the initial conditions being positive integers and the two inequalities.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there are more assumptions. The recursion has two cases depending on whether z_n < 2y_n. But the problem doesn't state any assumptions on y_n or z_n beyond the initial conditions. The user is asking about the limit based on the initial conditions, so the main assumptions are about y₁ and z₁.\n\nWait, the problem says \"assume that the initial values y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\" Then, the question is conditional on whether y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁. So, those two inequalities are part of the problem's conditions, not the assumptions. Wait, no—the user is asking: \"If y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, is it true that (⋆) is always 1, and otherwise the limit is always 3?\" So, the problem is to verify this conditional statement. Therefore, the assumptions would include y₁ and z₁ being positive integers, and the problem is the conditional statement about the limit.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So, in this case, the problem's assumptions are the initial conditions (y₁ and z₁ are positive integers) and the inequalities (y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁). But each assumption should address only one property. So, each inequality is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\n\nWait, but the example lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So, in the example, two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, the user writes \"assume that the initial values y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\" So, that's one assumption: y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers. Then, the other two assumptions would be y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking if when these inequalities hold, the limit is 1; otherwise, 3. So, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n\ny₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers,\n\ny₁ ≠ 2z₁,\n\n2y₁ ≠ z₁.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, the limit is 1, and otherwise (if either y₁ = 2z₁ or 2y₁ = z₁), the limit is 3. Wait, but the problem is framed as a question: \"If y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, is it true that (⋆) is always 1, and otherwise the limit is always 3?\"\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is split into two parts. However, the format requires a single problem statement. The original question is whether the conjecture is true: that under the inequalities, the limit is 1, else 3. So, the problem is to determine the truth of this statement.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is to verify the conjecture about the limit. So, the problem statement should be: \"Prove that if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, then the limit (⋆) is 1; otherwise, the limit is 3.\"\n\nBut the user also mentions that \"the limit may or may not exist, and it may or may not depend on the initial conditions.\" But the question is specifically when the initial conditions are integers and satisfy the inequalities. So, the problem is to show that under those assumptions, the limit is 1, and when they don't, it's 3.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n\ny₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers,\n\ny₁ ≠ 2z₁,\n\n2y₁ ≠ z₁.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit (⋆) is 1.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as a conditional: If the inequalities hold, is the limit 1? And otherwise, is it 3? So, the problem is both cases. However, the example only had the problem statement for one case. But the user's question is whether the conjecture is true: that the limit is 1 in the standard case (inequalities) and 3 otherwise.\n\nBut the format requires a single problem. Maybe the problem is to determine the value of the limit based on the initial conditions, hence:\n\nProblem: Prove that if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, then the limit (⋆) is 1; otherwise, the limit is 3.\n\nBut the assumptions would include the initial conditions being positive integers. Wait, the original problem says \"Let us assume that the initial values y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers. Question: If y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, is it true that (⋆) is always 1, and otherwise the limit is always 3?\"\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n- y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers,\n\nThen, the problem is the question about the limit depending on whether y₁ and z₁ satisfy the inequalities.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included both n being integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the initial values are assumed to be positive integers, which is one assumption. Then, the problem is conditional on the inequalities. However, in the format, the problem is stated after the assumptions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\ny₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers,\n\nProblem: If y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, is it true that $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\left(z_{n+1} - \\sum_{k=1}^n z_k\\right)$$ is always 1; otherwise, the limit is always 3?\n\nBut the example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. So, maybe here the problem is to prove the conditional statement about the limit. Thus, the assumptions are the initial conditions being integers, and the problem is the conditional statement about the limit.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as two separate points: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, \"y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers\" is one assumption. Then, the other two assumptions are y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁. But wait, in the problem statement, the user is asking if under these two inequalities, the limit is 1. So, the assumptions are:\n\n- y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers,\n\n- y₁ ≠ 2z₁,\n\n- 2y₁ ≠ z₁.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit (⋆) is 1.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to show that when the initial conditions are positive integers, then depending on whether they satisfy the inequalities, the limit is 1 or 3. Then the assumptions would be:\n\n- y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, then the limit (⋆) is 1; otherwise, the limit is 3.\n\nBut the example had assumptions that were conditions on the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is more complex. The user is asking to verify a conditional statement. The format requires listing all assumptions line by line and then the problem. So, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\ny₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers,\n\nProblem: Determine whether the limit (⋆) is 1 if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, and 3 otherwise.\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\". The original question is phrased as \"is it true that...\", so maybe the problem is to prove the conjecture.\n\nSo, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\ny₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers,\n\ny₁ ≠ 2z₁,\n\n2y₁ ≠ z₁.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\left(z_{n+1} - \\sum_{k=1}^n z_k\\right)$$ is equal to 1.\n\nBut the original question also asks about the \"otherwise\" case where the limit is 3. Since the problem is to verify both cases, perhaps the assumptions should list the initial conditions and the problem should encompass both scenarios. However, the format example had the problem as a single statement. To adhere to the example, perhaps split into two separate problems, but the user hasn't done that. The user's original question is the entire conditional statement. So perhaps the problem statement includes the conditional.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n\ny₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, then the limit (⋆) is 1; otherwise, the limit is 3.\n\nBut then the assumptions include only the initial conditions being integers, and the problem includes the conditional.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included both the variable being an integer and a divisibility condition. Here, the problem is a conditional statement where the hypotheses are part of the problem statement. However, the user's original question is framed as a single problem, so maybe the assumptions are the initial conditions (positive integers) and the problem is the conditional about the limit.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem specified assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem: assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems like the assistant in the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. But perhaps in the example, the user made an error. However, the current task is to follow the format as per the example, even if the example seems flawed.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions include the initial conditions being positive integers, and then any other conditions. However, the original problem states \"assume that the initial values y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers. Question: If y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, is it true that (⋆) is always 1, and otherwise the limit is always 3?\"\n\nSo, following the example's approach, the formatted problem would list the assumptions as:\n\n- y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers,\n\n- y₁ ≠ 2z₁,\n\n- 2y₁ ≠ z₁.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit (⋆) is 1.\n\nBut the original question is about both cases (when the inequalities hold and when they don't). However, the example seems to have focused on a specific case by adding assumptions. So, perhaps the correct approach is to list all assumptions, including the inequalities, and then the problem is to prove the limit is 1. But the user's question also includes the \"otherwise\" case, which would be when the inequalities don't hold. Since the example added assumptions beyond the original problem (introduced n divisible by 7), perhaps here we need to structure two separate problems. But the user hasn't done that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement includes the conditional.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the best approach is:\n\nAssumption:\n\ny₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, then the limit (⋆) is 1; otherwise, the limit is 3.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed separately, and the problem is a single statement. Since the original problem's question is the conditional, the assumptions are the initial conditions (positive integers), and the problem is the question about the limit depending on the inequalities.\n\nHowever, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the assistant in the example adjusted the problem, possibly focusing on a specific case. But in the current problem, the user hasn't done that. The original question is as stated, so we should follow it accurately.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\n\nProblem: If y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, is it true that the limit (⋆) is always 1; otherwise, the limit is always 3?\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", whereas here it's phrased as a question. To follow the example's structure, which used \"Prove that...\", perhaps the problem should be stated as:\n\nProblem: Prove that if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, then $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\left(z_{n+1} - \\sum_{k=1}^n z_k\\right) = 1$$; otherwise, the limit is 3.\n\nBut the example had assumptions listed, then the problem. So, the assumptions here are the initial conditions being integers, and the problem includes the conditional. Alternatively, the two inequalities could be part of the assumptions if we're only considering the case where they hold, but the original question includes both cases.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but given the example, perhaps the assumptions include the conditions on the initial values and the inequalities, and the problem is to prove the limit. However, since the user's question is about both cases (inequalities hold or not), we might need two separate formatted problems. But since the user provided a single example, it's better to follow the structure as per the original question.\n\nFinal decision: The original problem assumes y₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers, and asks about the limit in two cases: when y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, and otherwise. So, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\n\ny₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, then the limit (⋆) is 1; otherwise, the limit is 3.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are conditions that are applied, so if the problem is to prove the conditional statement, then the only assumption is y₁ and z₁ are integers. The conditional (inequalities) is part of the problem statement.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the assumptions are the initial conditions, and the problem is to prove the conditional about the limit. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\ny₁ and z₁ are strictly positive integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that if y₁ ≠ 2z₁ and 2y₁ ≠ z₁, then $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\left(z_{n+1} - \\sum_{k=1}^n z_k\\right) = 1$$; otherwise, the limit is 3.\n\nThis way, the assumptions are the initial conditions being integers, and the problem includes the conditional about the inequalities leading to the respective limits.",
