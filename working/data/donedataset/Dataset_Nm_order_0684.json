    "Content": "Let $X$ be a normed linear space, $x\\in X$ and $r>0$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that closed and open balls in a normed linear space are convex. The user tried to work through it but ended up with an inequality that doesn't quite get to the desired result.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that X is a normed linear space, x is a point in X, and r is a positive real number. The open and closed balls are defined around x with radius r. The goal is to show both balls are convex.\n\nLooking at the example given earlier, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So, the assumptions here would be:\n\n- X is a normed linear space.\n- x is an element of X.\n- r is a positive real number.\n- The closed ball is defined as the set of points y in X such that the norm of x - y is less than or equal to r.\n- The open ball is defined similarly with a strict inequality.\n- Convexity requires that for any two points in the set, the line segment between them is entirely within the set.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's conditions. The problem here is general for any normed space, any x, any r>0. So the main assumptions are the definitions of the balls and the properties of the normed space.\n\nThe user attempted the proof for the closed ball. They took two points y and z in the closed ball, and tried to show that any convex combination ty + (1-t)z is also in the closed ball. Their calculation led to an upper bound of r(2|t| + 1), which isn't ≤ r. The mistake might be in how they expanded the norm. Let me think.\n\nThe correct approach should use the triangle inequality properly. When they write ty + (1-t)z - x, that's equal to t(y - x) + (1 - t)(z - x). Then applying the norm, it's ≤ t||y - x|| + (1 - t)||z - x||. Since both norms are ≤ r, this becomes t*r + (1 - t)*r = r, which works. So the user might have made a mistake in their manipulation of the terms, leading to the incorrect bound.\n\nBut the task here isn't to solve the problem, just to structure it according to the format. So for the assumptions, list each condition. Let's parse the original problem again:\n\n\"Let X be a normed linear space, x∈X and r>0. Define the open and closed ball... Then B(x, r) and overline{B}(x, r) are convex.\"\n\nAssumptions would be:\n\n- X is a normed linear space.\n- x is an element of X.\n- r is a positive real number.\n- The open ball B(x, r) is defined as {y ∈ X : ||x - y|| < r}.\n- The closed ball overline{B}(x, r) is defined as {y ∈ X : ||x - y|| ≤ r}.\n- Convexity: For any two points in the set, the line segment between them is contained in the set.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove convexity, so the last point is part of what needs to be shown, not an assumption. The assumptions are the given conditions. So the problem's assumptions are the definitions of the balls and the structure of the space. Therefore, each line in the assumption section should be a given condition.\n\nSo structured:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed linear space,\nx is an element of X,\nr is a positive real number,\nB(x, r) is defined as { y ∈ X : ||x - y|| < r },\noverline{B}(x, r) is defined as { y ∈ X : ||x - y|| ≤ r }.\n\nProblem:\nProve that B(x, r) and overline{B}(x, r) are convex.\n\nBut wait, the example had assumptions that included conditions on n. Here, the problem doesn't have any conditions beyond the definitions. The original problem's user tried to proceed with the proof but had an incorrect step. The core assumptions are the definitions of the space, the point x, radius r, and the balls. So I think that's all. Each assumption is one line, each applying to one object or condition.\n\nYes, that should be it. So the formatted problem would list those assumptions and then state the problem as proving convexity.",
