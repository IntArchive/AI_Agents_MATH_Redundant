    "AcceptedAnswer": "The integral screams for a sub $x=e^u$; the result is $$\\int_0^{\\infty} du \\, e^{-u} \\frac{\\sin^4{u}}{u} $$ This is very computable by introducing a parameter and differentiating under the integral.  In this case, consider $$F(k) = \\int_0^{\\infty} du \\, e^{-k u} \\frac{\\sin^4{u}}{u} $$ $$F'(k) = -\\int_0^{\\infty} du \\, e^{-k u} \\sin^4{u} $$ $F'(k)$ is relatively easy to compute using the fact that $\\sin^4{u} = \\frac{3}{8}-\\frac12 \\cos{2 u} + \\frac18 \\cos{4 u}$, and that $$\\int_0^{\\infty} du \\, e^{-k u} \\cos{m u} =  \\frac{k}{k^2+m^2}$$ Thus $$F'(k) = -\\frac{3}{8 k} + \\frac12 \\frac{k}{k^2+4} - \\frac18 \\frac{k}{k^2+16} $$ and $$F(k) = -\\frac1{16} \\log{\\left [  \\frac{k^6 (k^2+16)}{(k^2+4)^4} \\right ]} + C$$ To evaluate $C$, we must consider $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} F(k)$ because $F(0)$ represents a non convergent integral.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this integral problem. The user wants to prove that the integral from 1 to infinity of [sin^4(log x)/(x^2 log x)] dx equals log(625/17)/16. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. The original question mentions using substitutions like log x = arcsin t, but that didn't work. So maybe another substitution would be better. Let me think about the structure of the integral.\n\nThe integral has sin^4(log x) divided by x^2 log x. The limits are from 1 to infinity. Since log x appears inside the sine and in the denominator, a substitution involving t = log x might simplify things. Let's try that.\n\nIf I let t = log x, then when x=1, t=0, and as x approaches infinity, t approaches infinity. Also, dx = e^t dt. Let's substitute:\n\nIntegral becomes from t=0 to t=infty of [sin^4(t)/(e^{2t} * t)] * e^t dt. Simplifying the exponents, e^{2t} in the denominator and e^t from dx gives e^{-t} in the numerator. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [sin^4(t) / t] e^{-t} dt.\n\nWait, that simplifies to ∫₀^∞ (sin^4 t) * e^{-t} / t dt. Hmm, integrating from 0 to infinity. The presence of e^{-t} suggests that maybe Laplace transforms or Gamma functions could be involved here. Alternatively, using integration techniques involving series expansion or trigonometric identities.\n\nSince sin^4 t can be expressed using power-reduction formulas. Let me recall that sin^4 t = (3/8) - (1/2)cos(2t) + (1/8)cos(4t). Let me verify that:\n\nUsing the identity sin^2 t = (1 - cos(2t))/2, so sin^4 t = [ (1 - cos 2t)/2 ]^2 = (1 - 2cos 2t + cos^2 2t)/4. Then cos^2 2t can be expressed as (1 + cos 4t)/2. So substituting:\n\nsin^4 t = [1 - 2cos2t + (1 + cos4t)/2 ] / 4 = [2 -4cos2t +1 + cos4t]/8 = (3 -4cos2t + cos4t)/8. Yes, correct. So sin^4 t = (3/8) - (1/2)cos(2t) + (1/8)cos(4t).\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [ (3/8 - (1/2)cos(2t) + (1/8)cos(4t)) * e^{-t} ] / t dt. This splits into three separate integrals:\n\n(3/8) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t}/t dt - (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} cos(2t)/t dt + (1/8) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} cos(4t)/t dt.\n\nBut wait, each of these integrals has 1/t multiplied by e^{-t} and cosine terms. However, integrating terms like ∫ e^{-at} cos(bt)/t dt from 0 to infinity can be related to the Laplace transform or perhaps the exponential integral function. But integrating 1/t multiplied by such terms might be problematic because 1/t has a singularity at t=0. But maybe considering the integral as the Laplace transform of [cos(bt)/t] evaluated at s=1? Wait, Laplace transforms typically are ∫₀^∞ e^{-st} f(t) dt. But here we have f(t) = cos(bt)/t. Hmm, but integrating cos(bt)/t * e^{-st} dt from 0 to infinity. That might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, recall that ∫₀^∞ e^{-at} (cos(bt) - 1)/t dt = - (1/2) ln(a^2 + b^2)/a^2), but I might need to check some integral tables or properties. Alternatively, differentiation under the integral sign. Let's consider the integral F(a) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-at} (cos(bt) - 1)/t dt. Then dF/da = -∫₀^∞ e^{-at} (cos(bt) -1) dt. Which would be - [ ∫₀^∞ e^{-at} cos(bt) dt - ∫₀^∞ e^{-at} dt ] = - [ a/(a^2 + b^2) - 1/a ].\n\nTherefore, F(a) = -∫ [ a/(a^2 + b^2) - 1/a ] da + C. Integrating with respect to a:\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: ∫ [ a/(a^2 + b^2) ] da = (1/2) ln(a^2 + b^2) + C\n\nSecond term: ∫ [ 1/a ] da = ln a + C\n\nSo F(a) = - [ (1/2) ln(a^2 + b^2) - ln a ] + C = - (1/2) ln(a^2 + b^2) + ln a + C.\n\nNow, determine the constant C. Consider the limit as a approaches infinity. Then e^{-at} tends to zero rapidly, so F(a) tends to ∫₀^∞ 0 dt = 0. So taking the limit as a→infty:\n\n0 = - (1/2) ln(a^2 + b^2) + ln a + C. Simplify:\n\n(1/2) ln(a^2 + b^2) = ln a + C\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nln(a^2 + b^2) = 2 ln a + 2C\n\n=> ln(a^2 + b^2) = ln a^2 + 2C\n\n=> ln(a^2 + b^2) - ln a^2 = 2C\n\n=> ln( (a^2 + b^2)/a^2 ) = 2C\n\n=> ln(1 + b^2/a^2 ) = 2C\n\nAs a→infty, ln(1 + 0) = 0 = 2C ⇒ C=0.\n\nTherefore, F(a) = - (1/2) ln(a^2 + b^2) + ln a = ln a - (1/2) ln(a^2 + b^2) = (1/2) ln(a^2) - (1/2) ln(a^2 + b^2) ) = (1/2) ln( a^2 / (a^2 + b^2) ) = (1/2) ln( 1 / (1 + b^2/a^2 ) ) = - (1/2) ln(1 + b^2/a^2 )\n\nBut F(a) was defined as ∫₀^∞ e^{-at} (cos(bt) -1)/t dt. Therefore,\n\n∫₀^∞ [cos(bt) -1]/t e^{-at} dt = - (1/2) ln(1 + b^2/a^2 )\n\nBut in our original integral, we have ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} cos(bt)/t dt. Let's see:\n\nNote that ∫₀^∞ e^{-at} [cos(bt) -1]/t dt = - (1/2) ln(1 + b^2/a^2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\n∫₀^∞ e^{-at} cos(bt)/t dt = ∫₀^∞ e^{-at} [cos(bt) -1 +1]/t dt = ∫₀^∞ e^{-at} [cos(bt) -1]/t dt + ∫₀^∞ e^{-at}/t dt.\n\nBut ∫₀^∞ e^{-at}/t dt is divergent because near t=0, e^{-at} ~1, so integral behaves like ∫₀^epsilon 1/t dt, which diverges. Therefore, the individual integrals ∫ e^{-at} cos(bt)/t dt and ∫ e^{-at}/t dt are both divergent, but their difference is convergent.\n\nBut in our problem, the original integral is ∫₀^∞ [ sin^4(t) e^{-t} ] / t dt. Which we expanded into three terms:\n\n(3/8) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t}/t dt - (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} cos(2t)/t dt + (1/8) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} cos(4t)/t dt.\n\nEach of these integrals is divergent, but their combination might be convergent. Let's see:\n\nLet me denote the three integrals as I1, I2, I3:\n\nI1 = ∫₀^∞ e^{-t}/t dt,\n\nI2 = ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} cos(2t)/t dt,\n\nI3 = ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} cos(4t)/t dt.\n\nBut each of these integrals is divergent. However, the combination (3/8)I1 - (1/2)I2 + (1/8)I3 might converge if the divergences cancel out. Let's check the coefficients. Let's express the combination:\n\n(3/8)I1 - (1/2)I2 + (1/8)I3 = (3/8 - 1/2 + 1/8) I1 - (1/2)(I2 - I1) + (1/8)(I3 - I1) ?\n\nWait, maybe not the right approach. Alternatively, since the original integrand [sin^4(t) e^{-t}]/t is O(t^3) as t→0, which is t^3 / t = t^2, so the integrand is O(t^2) near zero, which is integrable. And as t→infty, e^{-t} dominates, so it's convergent. Therefore, the original integral is convergent, even though splitting it into those three integrals might lead to individually divergent terms. So maybe my approach of expanding sin^4(t) and then splitting the integral is problematic because of the divergences. Therefore, perhaps another method is needed.\n\nAlternative approach: Use substitution u = log x, which transforms the original integral into ∫₀^∞ [sin^4 u / (e^{2u} log x)] e^u du. Wait, no, original substitution was t = log x, so x = e^t, dx = e^t dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [sin^4 t / (e^{2t} * t)] * e^t dt = ∫₀^∞ [sin^4 t / t] e^{-t} dt. So that's correct. So the integrand is sin^4(t) e^{-t} / t, which is okay because as t→0, sin^4 t ~ t^4, so sin^4 t / t ~ t^3, and e^{-t} ~1, so integrand is ~ t^3, which is integrable at 0. As t→infty, e^{-t} dominates, so integrand decays exponentially. So integral is convergent.\n\nBut expressing sin^4 t in terms of cosines gives us terms that individually have divergent integrals, but their combination converges. Therefore, maybe we can use the identity that relates to the integral of [1 - cos(bt)] e^{-at}/t dt, which we saw earlier.\n\nWait, recall that:\n\n∫₀^∞ [1 - cos(bt)] e^{-at}/t dt = (1/2) ln(1 + b²/a² )\n\nFrom the previous result, since:\n\n∫₀^∞ [cos(bt) -1]/t e^{-at} dt = - (1/2) ln(1 + b²/a² )\n\nTherefore,\n\n∫₀^∞ [1 - cos(bt)]/t e^{-at} dt = (1/2) ln(1 + b²/a² )\n\nSo in our case, we have terms with cos(2t) and cos(4t). Let's see:\n\nThe original integrand after substitution is [sin^4 t] e^{-t}/t. Which we expressed as [ (3/8) - (1/2)cos(2t) + (1/8)cos(4t) ] e^{-t}/t. So:\n\nIntegral = (3/8) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t}/t dt - (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} cos(2t)/t dt + (1/8) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} cos(4t)/t dt.\n\nBut as mentioned, each integral is divergent. However, if we consider the combination, maybe we can write this as:\n\nIntegral = (3/8) I1 - (1/2) I2 + (1/8) I3.\n\nBut each I1, I2, I3 is divergent. However, perhaps we can express this in terms of the integrals involving [1 - cos(bt)]:\n\nLet's rewrite the expression:\n\n3/8 I1 -1/2 I2 +1/8 I3 = 3/8 I1 -1/2 I2 +1/8 I3.\n\nNote that if we write this as:\n\n(3/8) I1 - (1/2) I2 + (1/8) I3 = (3/8 - 1/2 + 1/8) I1 - (1/2)(I2 - I1) + (1/8)(I3 - I1).\n\nBut 3/8 - 1/2 + 1/8 = (3 -4 +1)/8 = 0/8 = 0. So the combination is:\n\n- (1/2)(I2 - I1) + (1/8)(I3 - I1).\n\nWhich is:\n\n-1/2 ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} (cos 2t -1)/t dt + 1/8 ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} (cos 4t -1)/t dt.\n\nNow, each of these integrals is of the form ∫ [1 - cos(bt)] e^{-t}/t dt, which from the previous result is (1/2) ln(1 + b²/1² ), since a=1 here.\n\nSo for the first term, b=2:\n\n∫₀^∞ [1 - cos(2t)] e^{-t}/t dt = (1/2) ln(1 + (2)^2/1^2 ) = (1/2) ln(5).\n\nFor the second term, b=4:\n\n∫₀^∞ [1 - cos(4t)] e^{-t}/t dt = (1/2) ln(1 + (4)^2/1^2 ) = (1/2) ln(17).\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nIntegral = -1/2 * [ (1/2) ln(5) ] + 1/8 * [ (1/2) ln(17) ] = - (1/4) ln(5) + (1/16) ln(17).\n\nWait, but the original expression was:\n\nIntegral = - (1/2) * [ ∫ (cos2t -1)/t e^{-t} dt ] + (1/8) * [ ∫ (cos4t -1)/t e^{-t} dt ]\n\nBut since ∫ [1 - cos(bt) ] /t e^{-t} dt = (1/2) ln(1 + b²), then ∫ [cos(bt) -1 ] /t e^{-t} dt = - (1/2) ln(1 + b²).\n\nSo substituting:\n\nIntegral = - (1/2) * [ - (1/2) ln(5) ] + (1/8) * [ - (1/2) ln(17) ]\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's clarify:\n\nWe have:\n\n- (1/2) * ∫ (cos2t -1)/t e^{-t} dt = - (1/2) * [ - (1/2) ln(1 + 4) ] = - (1/2) * [ - (1/2) ln5 ] = (1/4) ln5.\n\nSimilarly, (1/8) * ∫ (cos4t -1)/t e^{-t} dt = (1/8) * [ - (1/2) ln(1 + 16) ] = (1/8)( - (1/2) ln17 ) = - (1/16) ln17.\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes:\n\n(1/4) ln5 - (1/16) ln17.\n\nCombine these terms:\n\n= (4/16) ln5 - (1/16) ln17 = (1/16)(4 ln5 - ln17).\n\nWhich is equal to (1/16)(ln5^4 - ln17) = (1/16) ln(625/17).\n\nTherefore, the integral equals log(625/17)/16, as required. So the key steps were substituting t = log x to simplify the integral, expanding sin^4 t using trigonometric identities, and then handling the divergent integrals by expressing them in terms of convergent integrals involving [1 - cos(bt)], which can be evaluated using known results or differentiation under the integral sign. This avoids dealing with the divergent parts individually and leverages the cancellation of divergences in the combination.",
