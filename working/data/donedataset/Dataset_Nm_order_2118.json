    "Content": "Do we have the following inverse tangent integral representation in the literature or remember some particular cases of it? $$\\small \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\displaystyle \\arctan\\left(\\frac{4 x y}{(1+x^2)(1-y^2)}\\right)\\operatorname{arctanh}(x)}{1+x^2}\\textrm{d}x=\\int_0^y \\frac{\\arctan(t)}{t}\\textrm{d}t=\\operatorname{Ti_2}(y), \\ |y|<1.$$ I tried to use https://approach0.xyz/ , but it seems to be down at the moment. It's proposed by Cornel I. V. , and his solution is immediately obtained by combining the odd case below \\begin{equation*}\n\\ \\color{blue}{\\small\\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\sin(2 n x)\\operatorname{arctanh}(\\tan(x))\\textrm{d}x}=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle  \\quad \\dfrac{\\pi}{8} (-1)^{m-1}\\dfrac{1}{2m-1}, \\qquad  \\qquad \\quad  n=2m-1, \\ m \\in \\mathbb{N}; \\\\[10pt]\n\\displaystyle \\quad \\dfrac{1}{4}(-1)^{m-1}\\dfrac{ H_{2m}}{m}-\\frac{1}{8}(-1)^{m-1}\\dfrac{ H_m}{m}\\\\[10pt]\n\\displaystyle =\\dfrac{1}{4} (-1)^{m-1}\\dfrac{\\overline{H}_{2m}}{m}+\\frac{1}{8}(-1)^{m-1}\\dfrac{ H_m}{m}, \\ n=2m, \\ m \\in \\mathbb{N},\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*} where $H_n=\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k}$ is the $n$ th harmonic number and $\\overline{H}_n=\\sum_{k=1}^n(-1)^{k-1}\\frac{1}{k}$ represents the $n$ th skew-harmonic number, found with an elementary proof here , and $\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}y^{2n-1} \\frac{\\sin((2n-1)x)}{2n-1}= \\frac{1}{2}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2 y\\sin(x)}{1-y^2}\\right), \\ 0<x<2\\pi, |y|<1$ . I would like to see solutions that utilize alternative methods, with no use of series if possible. (no hurry, whenever it seems interesting enough to deserve some efforts) A first note: Exploiting the main result, we can get some curious results involving the golden ratio, $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\displaystyle \\text{Ti}_2\\left(\\frac{4 x}{1+x^2}\\right) \\text{arctanh}(x)}{1+x^2} \\textrm{d}x= \\frac{\\pi }{4}  \\int_0^{1/\\phi } \\frac{\\displaystyle \\arctan(x) \\log \\left(\\frac{1-x^2}{x}\\right)}{x} \\textrm{d}x, \\tag1$$ which can be developed further and brought to a closed form , but more interestingly, I believe it can be exploited to get sums of integrals with nice closed forms. Another (optional) request (if I'm allowed) I think I would also love to see how to go with evaluating $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\displaystyle \\text{Ti}_2\\left(\\frac{4 x}{1+x^2}\\right) \\text{arctanh}(x)}{1+x^2} \\textrm{d}x,$$ on the left-hand side of $(1)$ from a very different perspective, without exploiting the main result (there is no need for full solutions, but ideas that clearly work). A second note: If we are used to some well-known Cauchy products involving harmonic numbers, then it is not hard to related the closed form of the integral in blue, the even case , to $\\displaystyle \\arctan^2(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}x^{2n} \\frac{2H_{2n}-H_n}{n}, \\ |x|\\le1$ , by also using the following familiar result, $\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}y^n \\sin(nx)=\\frac{y\\sin(x)}{1-2y\\cos(x)+y^2}, \\ |y|<1$ , and then we get to the so-beautiful result, $$\\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\frac{\\sin (4 x) \\text{arctanh}(\\tan (x))}{1-2 y^2 \\cos (4 x)+y^4} \\textrm{d}x=\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{\\arctan^2(y)}{y^2}, \\ |y|<1.$$ A third note: we probably might also enjoy a related result that involves a product of two inverse hyperbolic tangents, like $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\displaystyle \\text{arctanh}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2} x}{1+x^2}\\right)\\text{arctanh}(x)}{1+x^2} \\textrm{d}x=\\frac{\\pi ^3}{64}-\\frac{\\pi}{16}\\log ^2\\left(\\sqrt{2}-1\\right).$$ Yes, it looks great!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Reference to a more general result The result is already known in a more general form, as shown here by Sangchul Lee : $$\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\arctan\\left( \\frac{2r\\sin\\theta}{1-r^{2}} \\right) \\arctan\\left( \\frac{2s\\sin\\theta}{1-s^{2}} \\right) d\\theta = \\pi \\chi_{2}(rs)$$ Where $\\chi_2(x)$ is Legendre's Chi function . Shifting $s\\to is$ and using $\\operatorname{Ti}_2(x)=-i\\chi_2(ix)$ yields: $$\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\arctan\\left( \\frac{2r\\sin\\theta}{1-r^{2}} \\right) \\operatorname{arctanh}\\left( \\frac{2s\\sin\\theta}{1+s^{2}} \\right) d\\theta = \\pi \\operatorname{Ti}_{2}(rs)$$ $$\\overset{\\large \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = x} \\Rightarrow \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2r}{1-r^{2}} \\frac{2x}{1+x^2}\\right) \\operatorname{arctanh}\\left(\\frac{2s}{1+s^{2}} \\frac{2x}{1+x^2}\\right)}{1+x^2} dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\operatorname{Ti}_{2}(rs)$$ Finally, by setting $s=1$ and using $2\\operatorname{arctanh} x = \\operatorname{arctanh} \\frac{2x}{1+x^2}$ , we arrive at the particular case seen in the question. Admittedly, I haven't seen it stated in terms of $\\operatorname{Ti}_2(x)$ . Perhaps it's worth to mention that it can also be written in the following form: $$\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\operatorname{arctanh}\\left( \\frac{2r\\sin\\theta}{1+r^{2}} \\right)\\operatorname{arctanh}\\left( \\frac{2s\\sin\\theta}{1+s^{2}} \\right) d\\theta = \\pi \\chi_{2}(rs)$$ A direct approach In order to also have it here self-contained, we can quickly adapt the approach for the $\\operatorname{arctanh}$ function, without using any kind of series. $$\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\color{blue}{\\arctan\\left( \\frac{2r\\sin\\theta}{1-r^{2}} \\right)} \\color{red}{\\operatorname{arctanh}\\left( \\frac{2s\\sin\\theta}{1+s^{2}} \\right)} d\\theta$$ $$=\\color{red}{\\int_0^{\\large\\frac{2s}{1+s^2}}}\\color{blue}{\\int_0^{\\large \\frac{2r}{1-r^2}}}\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\color{blue}{\\sin \\theta}\\color{red}{\\sin \\theta}}{\\color{blue}{(1+x^2 \\sin^2 \\theta)}\\color{red}{(1-y^2\\sin^2 \\theta)}}d\\theta \\color{blue}{dx}\\color{red}{dy}$$ $$=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\int_0^{\\large \\frac{2s}{1+s^2}}\\int_0^{\\large \\frac{2r}{1-r^2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{1+x^2}-\\sqrt{1-y^2}}{x^2+y^2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}\\sqrt{1-y^2}}dxdy$$ $$\\underset{\\large y\\to \\frac{2y}{1+y^2}}{\\overset{\\large x\\to \\frac{2x}{1-x^2}}=}\\ \\pi \\int_0^s \\int_0^r \\frac{dxdy}{1+x^2 y^2}=\\pi\\int_0^s\\frac{\\arctan(ry)}{y}dy\\overset{ry\\to y}=\\boxed{\\pi\\operatorname{Ti}_2(rs)}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user provided a question from Math Stack Exchange about a proposed integral representation for the inverse tangent integral function Ti₂(y). The original problem is quite lengthy with multiple parts and notes, so I need to filter out the unrelated information and structure it properly.\n\nFirst, the main problem is to verify whether a certain integral equation holds. The equation given is:\n\n(4/π) * ∫₀¹ [arctan(4xy / ((1 + x²)(1 - y²))) * arctanh(x) / (1 + x²)] dx = ∫₀ʸ (arctan(t)/t) dt = Ti₂(y), for |y| < 1.\n\nThe user mentions that this is proposed by Cornel I.V. and refers to some related integrals and series, but the core problem seems to be proving that integral representation. The assumptions would include the conditions on the variables and functions involved. Let me list the assumptions step by step.\n\nAssumptions needed:\n- The integral is from 0 to 1 for the variable x.\n- The parameter y satisfies |y| < 1.\n- The integrand involves arctan and arctanh functions, which are defined under these conditions (since arctanh(x) is defined for |x| < 1, and x ranges from 0 to 1 here, which is okay).\n- The functions involved are integrable over the given interval.\n\nThe problem is to prove the equality of the integral to Ti₂(y). The other parts of the original post, like the blue integral result, the notes about golden ratio, and other integrals, seem to be additional context or corollaries, not the main problem. So I need to exclude those. Also, the user mentions wanting solutions without using series if possible, which is a condition on the method, but the problem itself doesn't change based on the method, so maybe that's a note but not part of the problem statement. The key is to extract the main integral equation that needs proving, along with its conditions.\n\nSo the assumptions would include the domain of integration, the range of y, and perhaps the definitions of the functions involved. Each assumption should be a single condition on one object. Let me check the example provided in the user's instruction. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So here, similarly, the assumptions would be:\n\n- y is a real number such that |y| < 1.\n- The integral is taken over x from 0 to 1.\n- The functions arctan and arctanh are defined in their standard branches (though this might be implicit given the domain restrictions, but perhaps better to include for clarity).\n\nWait, but maybe more precise. The integrand has arctanh(x), which requires x in (-1,1), but since x is from 0 to 1, that's okay. The argument inside arctan is (4xy)/((1 + x²)(1 - y²)), and since |y| < 1, the denominator (1 - y²) is positive, so the argument is valid as long as the expression is real, which it is here. So the main conditions are on y and the integration limits.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\ny is a real number with |y| < 1,\nthe integral is evaluated over x from 0 to 1,\nthe functions arctan and arctanh are considered in their principal branches.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n(4/π) ∫₀¹ [arctan(4xy / ((1 + x²)(1 - y²)) ) * arctanh(x) / (1 + x²)] dx = Ti₂(y),\nwhere Ti₂(y) = ∫₀ʸ (arctan(t)/t) dt.\n\nI need to make sure that the problem is clearly stated with the integral expressions properly formatted. The user's example used LaTeX, so I should follow that. Also, the original problem had some formatting with small font, but that's probably not necessary. The key is to present the integral equality as the main problem to prove, with the assumptions on y and the integral limits.\n\nThe other parts of the original question, like the optional requests or additional notes, should be excluded since they are not part of the main problem to be structured here. The task is to filter out unrelated information and present the core problem with its assumptions.",
