    "Content": "How do I go about proving that the composition of formal power series is associative? I've tried proving the result directly, but the resulting expressions are quite unwieldy. Currently, I'm trying to make use of the topology on $\\mathbb{C}[[x]]$, but I can't quite get it to work. More precisely, I want to prove that if $g(0)=0$ and $h(0)=0$, then $f\\circ(g\\circ h)=(f\\circ g)\\circ h$, where $$f\\circ g(x) :=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n (g(x))^n.$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A formal power series $g(x)$ such that $g(0)=0$ gives you a continuous ring homomorphism $g^*:K[[x]]\\to K[[x]]$ uniquely defined by $x\\mapsto g(x)$. In fact, $g^*(f)=f\\circ g$ (it is clear if $f$ is a polynomial and extends by continuity to power series). As $h^*(g^*(x))=h^*(g(x))=g(h(x))=(g\\circ h)^*(x)$, we have $h^*\\circ g^*=(g\\circ h)^*$. Evaluating both sides on $f$ we get $(f\\circ g)\\circ h=f\\circ (g\\circ h)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the question about proving that composition of formal power series is associative. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem should be formatted. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The user mentions that they tried direct proof but expressions became unwieldy, and they're considering the topology on $\\mathbb{C}[[x]]]. The key parts are proving associativity: f∘(g∘h) = (f∘g)∘h, with conditions that g(0)=0 and h(0)=0. The composition is defined as f∘g(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty f_n (g(x))^n.\n\nNow, to format this into the required structure. The assumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. g is a formal power series with g(0) = 0.\n2. h is a formal power series with h(0) = 0.\n3. Composition of f and g is defined as f∘g(x) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n (g(x))^n.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user mentions that g(0)=0 and h(0)=0. So each of these is a separate assumption on different objects. The composition formula applies to all formal power series f, but the associativity holds under the conditions on g and h. Also, the problem is to prove associativity under these conditions.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each condition on g and h separately. The problem statement is about associativity of composition given these conditions. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- g is a formal power series with g(0) = 0.\n- h is a formal power series with h(0) = 0.\n- Composition f∘g is defined as ∑_{n=0}^∞ f_n (g(x))^n.\n\nProblem: Prove that f∘(g∘h) = (f∘g)∘h.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user specifies that the composition is associative when g(0)=0 and h(0)=0. So the key assumptions are on g and h. The definition of composition is part of the problem setup, not an assumption. However, the example given included the definition as part of the problem statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, actually in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the example was misformatted. However, in the current problem, the user's example might not be perfect, but we need to follow the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. So maybe the example is incorrect, but we need to proceed based on the instruction.\n\nIn our current problem, the original question says that the user wants to prove associativity when g(0)=0 and h(0)=0. Therefore, these are the assumptions. The definition of composition is part of the problem setup, but perhaps it's considered an assumption about how composition is defined. Alternatively, maybe the definition is part of the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the example, the problem statement included the definition of A(n), so perhaps the composition definition here would be part of the problem statement. However, the user's example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, so perhaps the definition would be part of the problem, not assumptions. \n\nSo perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- g is a formal power series with g(0) = 0.\n- h is a formal power series with h(0) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f∘(g∘h) = (f∘g)∘h, where composition is defined as f∘g(x) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ f_n (g(x))^n.\n\nAlternatively, if the definition of composition is considered an assumption, then:\n\nAssumption:\n- Composition of formal power series f and g is defined as f∘g(x) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ f_n (g(x))^n.\n- g is a formal power series with g(0) = 0.\n- h is a formal power series with h(0) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f∘(g∘h) = (f∘g)∘h.\n\nBut in the example, the problem included the expression in the problem statement. So perhaps the definition is part of the problem statement. The example had the expression in the problem line. So here, the problem line would include the definition. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions on g and h, and the problem includes the definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement should state the composition formula as part of the problem. Let me check the original question again. The user wrote:\n\n\"Prove that if g(0)=0 and h(0)=0, then f∘(g∘h)=(f∘g)∘h, where f∘g(x) := ∑_{n=0}^∞ f_n (g(x))^n.\"\n\nSo the \"where\" clause defines the composition. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the problem statement should include the definition. So the assumptions are the conditions on g and h, and the problem includes the definition.\n\nThus, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- g is a formal power series with g(0) = 0.\n- h is a formal power series with h(0) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f∘(g∘h) = (f∘g)∘h, where composition is defined as f∘g(x) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ f_n (g(x))^n.\n\nYes, that seems right. The key assumptions are on g and h having constant term 0. The problem is to prove associativity under those conditions, with the given composition definition.",
