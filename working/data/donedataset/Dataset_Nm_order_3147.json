    "Content": "There is another post with this exact same prompt which got several down-votes for not showing  their work.  So I'll show what work I've got.  I know being a harmonic function implies satisfying the Mean Value Property, thus what I thought I'd do is consider two arbitrary points in $\\mathbb{C}$ and prove that: $$|u(z) - u(w)|=|\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi}u(z - re^{i\\theta})d\\theta - \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi}u(w - te^{i\\theta})d\\theta| $$\n$$= |\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi}u(z - re^{i\\theta}) - u(w - te^{i\\theta})d\\theta|$$ Now what I wan't to do is take r and t to infinity and prove this integral goes to zero, but I can't figure out how to do that.  I've used the fact that my harmonic function u is defined on all of $\\mathbb{C}$ in taking t and r to infinity but I still need to use the fact that it's bounded. I also read through the proof of Liouville's Theorem, given as an answer in that other post, which seems intuitively correct but rather un-rigorous.  It actually says that the value in the center of a ball is equal to the average over the ball's volume.  I imagine this can be proven from the average over the boundary since the average over the boundary will not change as you continuously shrink the boundary down to its center. This however would require the difference of two surface integrals, or is there a simpler way? I was also considering using the Maximum Modulus Principle somehow but I haven't found a way yet.  I've probably made this way more complicated than it has to be, hopefully someone can help me, thanks! =]. Edit: Ok after thinking some more about the accepted answer in that other post, I've decided what I need to do is look at the canonical holomorphic function whose real part is my harmonic function u, and prove that holomorphic function is bounded.  From there I can prove that since it's entire and bounded that it's constant, and from there prove that then its real part must be constant.  So could someone talk a bit about the construction of this canonical holomorphic function?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'll expand on Nelson's proof a bit. You know the Mean Value Property that the value of a harmonic function $u$ at $z$ equals the average of its values on any circle centered at $z$.  We can turn this into a fact about averages over balls (which in this case are disks) just by using polar coordinates:\n$$\\int_{B(z,R)} u(w)\\,dw = \\int_0^R \\int_0^{2\\pi} u(z + r e^{i \\theta}) r \\,d\\theta\\,dr = \\int_0^R 2 \\pi u(z) r\\,dr = u(z) \\pi R^2.$$\nDividing both sides by $\\pi R^2$, we see that $u(z)$ equals the average value of $u$ over the ball $B(z,R)$. Now fix $z,w \\in \\mathbb{C}$, and consider disks $B(z,R)$, $B(w,R)$ centered at each of them.  Let $L = B(z,R) \\cap B(w,R)$ be the lens-shaped region lying in both disks.  Let $L_z = B(z,r) \\backslash L$ be the region in the $z$ disk but not the $w$ disk.  (Draw a picture.)  One can work out the area $A(L)$ of $L$ by a bit of multivariable calculus (or look it up on Mathworld ).  A bit more calculus shows that the ratio $\\frac{A(L)}{\\pi R^2} \\to 1$ as $R \\to \\infty$, so that the lens occupies \"most\" of the disk.  Since $A(L) + A(L_z) = \\pi R^2$, we must therefore have $\\frac{A(L_z)}{\\pi R^2} \\to 0$. Now by the mean value property, for any $R$ we have\n$$u(z) = \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} \\int_{B(z,R)} u(\\zeta)\\,d\\zeta = \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} \\int_L u(\\zeta)\\,d\\zeta + \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} \\int_{L_z} u(\\zeta)\\,d\\zeta.$$\nFor the second term, if $|u|$ is bounded by some constant $M$, we have as $R \\to \\infty$,\n$$\\left|\\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} \\int_{L_z} u(\\zeta)\\,d\\zeta \\right| \\le \\frac{M A(L_z)}{\\pi R^2} \\to 0.$$\nThus\n$$u(z) = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} \\int_L u(\\zeta)\\,d\\zeta.$$\nBut if we replace $z$ with $w$ we can make exactly the same argument (replacing $L_z$ by $L_w$ whose area is the same, by symmetry).  So we also have\n$$u(w) = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} \\int_L u(\\zeta)\\,d\\zeta.$$\nThus $u(z) = u(w)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that a bounded harmonic function on the complex plane is constant. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions a harmonic function on ℂ (the entire complex plane) that's bounded. So the main assumptions here are:\n\n1. The function u is harmonic on ℂ. That means it satisfies Laplace's equation everywhere in the complex plane.\n2. The function u is bounded. There exists some M > 0 such that |u(z)| ≤ M for all z ∈ ℂ.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that such a function must be constant. \n\nLooking at the user's example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Here, the object is u, and the two properties are harmonicity on ℂ and boundedness. So I should list these as separate assumptions. \n\nI also need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The user mentions using the Mean Value Property, Liouville's Theorem, Maximum Modulus Principle, and constructing a holomorphic function with real part u. But in the problem statement itself, the key given conditions are harmonicity and boundedness on the entire complex plane. The rest are approaches the user considered but aren't part of the problem's assumptions. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nu is harmonic on ℂ,\nu is bounded.\n\nProblem:\nShow that u is constant.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user also mentioned the other post's answer referring to Liouville's Theorem and constructing a holomorphic function. But the core problem as stated in the title and initial question is just that a bounded harmonic function on ℂ is constant. The rest are the user's attempts and thoughts. So the assumptions are just the two properties of u: harmonic and bounded on the entire complex plane. No need to include other conditions like differentiability or continuity because harmonic functions are already smooth. \n\nSo yeah, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nu is harmonic on ℂ,\nu is bounded on ℂ.\n\nProblem:\nShow that u is constant.",
