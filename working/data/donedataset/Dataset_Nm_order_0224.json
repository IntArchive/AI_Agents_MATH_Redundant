    "AcceptedAnswer": "A proof that the sequence $\\frac{\\tan(n)}{n}$ does not have a limit for $n\\to \\infty$ is given in this article (Sequential tangents, Sam Coskey) . This, of course, implies that the series does not converge. The proof, based on this paper by Rosenholtz (*), uses the continued fraction of $\\pi/2$, and, essentially, it shows that it's possible to find a subsequence such that $\\tan(n_k)$ is \"big enough\", by taking numerators of the truncated continued fraction (\"convergents\").

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to know if the series ∑_{k=1}^∞ tan(k)/k converges or diverges. Hmm, tan(k) is the tangent function, which has a period of π, but since k is an integer here, we're evaluating tangent at integer radian values. Wait, radians, right? So each term is tan(k) divided by k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nFirst, I remember that the tangent function has vertical asymptotes at odd multiples of π/2. So whenever k approaches an odd multiple of π/2, tan(k) blows up. But since we're dealing with integers k, I need to check how close integers get to these asymptotes. For example, π is approximately 3.14159, so 3π/2 is about 4.7124. The closest integers to 3π/2 would be 4 and 5. So tan(4) and tan(5) might be large, but not infinite. Similarly, 5π/2 is around 7.8539, so near 8. So tan(7), tan(8) might be large. Wait, but how close do integers get to these asymptotes?\n\nI recall that the question of how close integers can get to multiples of π/2 is related to the concept of irrationality measure or Diophantine approximation. Since π is irrational, the sequence k mod π is dense in [0, π), meaning that the fractional parts get arbitrarily close to any number in that interval. But how quickly does this happen? If the irrationality measure of π is finite, then there's a limit to how well it can be approximated by rationals. But I'm not sure about the exact measure here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the equidistribution theorem. Since π is irrational, the sequence k mod 2π is equidistributed modulo 2π. That means that the angles k radians are spread out uniformly around the unit circle. However, tan(k) has period π, so maybe we can consider equidistribution modulo π. If the angles k mod π are equidistributed in [0, π), then tan(k) would take on all real values densely, but with a symmetry around π/2. But tan(k) would be positive in (0, π/2) and negative in (π/2, π), but since we're taking absolute values or something? Wait, the series is just sum tan(k)/k, so the terms can be both positive and negative. But convergence of such series can be tricky because of possible cancellation.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that tan(k) doesn't decay to zero. For the series to converge, the terms must approach zero. If tan(k) doesn't approach zero, then tan(k)/k might not go to zero. However, tan(k) can be both large positive and large negative, so maybe there's cancellation. But to have convergence, the terms need to go to zero. If |tan(k)/k| doesn't go to zero, then the series can't converge absolutely. But even for conditional convergence (if alternating), the terms still need to go to zero. So maybe the key is to determine whether tan(k) grows without bound as k increases, or if it's bounded, or oscillates between large positive and negative values.\n\nBut wait, since k is an integer, and π is irrational, k will never be exactly an odd multiple of π/2, so tan(k) is always defined. However, the question is whether tan(k) can get arbitrarily large in absolute value. If yes, then |tan(k)/k| could be comparable to 1/k times something growing, which might not decay. But if tan(k) doesn't grow too fast, maybe the 1/k term dominates.\n\nI need to check how close integers can get to the poles of tan(k). The distance from k to (2m+1)π/2 for some integer m. Let’s denote the distance as |k - (2m+1)π/2|. The smaller this distance, the larger |tan(k)| will be. So if there are infinitely many integers k such that |k - (2m+1)π/2| < ε for some ε, then |tan(k)| ~ 1/ε, so |tan(k)/k| ~ 1/(εk). If ε can be as small as 1/k^2, for example, then 1/(εk) would be ~k, leading to terms that don't decay. But how close can k approach the poles?\n\nThis relates to the irrationality measure of π. If π has a finite irrationality measure μ, then for any ε > 0, there exists a constant C such that |π/2 - p/q| > C/q^{μ + ε} for all integers p, q. So the distance between p and q*(π/2) would be roughly C/q^{μ-1 + ε}. Wait, I might need to think in terms of approximating π by rationals. Let’s suppose we have that for any integers p, q, |π - p/q| > C/q^{μ}. Then, considering (2m+1)π/2 ≈ k, so m ≈ (2k)/(π) - 1/2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's look at the approximation of π by fractions p/q. If π can be approximated by p/q with |π - p/q| < 1/q^{μ}, then the distance between q and (p/(2))π would be small. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that the sequence {k} mod π is dense in [0, π), so there are infinitely many k where k approaches (2m+1)π/2 from either side, making tan(k) very large in absolute value. If that's the case, then |tan(k)/k| would be approximately |1/(k*(distance to the pole))|. If the distance is on the order of 1/k, then |tan(k)/k| ~ 1/(k*(1/k)) = 1, so the terms don't decay, leading to divergence. However, if the distance is bounded below by some constant over k^2, then |tan(k)/k| ~ k, which would definitely make the terms not go to zero.\n\nBut I need to recall the Dirichlet approximation theorem, which states that for any real number α and positive integer N, there exist integers p, q with 1 ≤ q ≤ N such that |α - p/q| < 1/(qN). Applying this to α = π/2, we get that there are infinitely many fractions p/q such that |π/2 - p/q| < 1/(q^2). This implies that there are infinitely many q such that |π/2 - p/q| < 1/q^2, which would mean that |q*(π/2) - p| < 1/q. Letting k = p and m = q, then |k - mπ/2| < 1/m. But m is approximately 2k/π. So substituting back, |k - (2k/π)(π/2)| = |k - k| = 0, but this might not be the right way. Wait, perhaps for each approximation p/q of π/2 with |π/2 - p/q| < 1/q^2, then multiplying both sides by q gives |q*(π/2) - p| < 1/q. So the integer p is within 1/q of qπ/2. Therefore, the distance between qπ/2 and the nearest integer p is less than 1/q. Then, tan(p) ≈ tan(qπ/2 ± 1/q) ≈ tan(±1/q) ≈ ±1/q. Wait, no. Wait, if p is close to qπ/2, then p = qπ/2 + δ, where |δ| < 1/q. Then tan(p) = tan(qπ/2 + δ). But tan(qπ/2 + δ) behaves like -cot(δ) if q is odd, and tan(δ) if q is even. So if q is odd, then tan(p) ≈ -cot(δ) ≈ -1/δ, and since δ ≈ 1/q, then tan(p) ≈ -q. Therefore, |tan(p)| ≈ q. But p ≈ qπ/2, so p is roughly proportional to q. Therefore, |tan(p)/p| ≈ q / (q π/2) ) = 2/π, which is a constant. Therefore, for these p, tan(p)/p ≈ constant, so the terms don't go to zero. Hence, the series ∑ tan(k)/k would have infinitely many terms with absolute value around 2/π, so the necessary condition for convergence (terms tending to zero) isn't met. Therefore, the series diverges.\n\nBut wait, this is contingent on the existence of infinitely many such p and q. By Dirichlet's theorem, there are infinitely many approximations, so yes, there are infinitely many k=p where |tan(k)| is approximately q, and q ≈ 2k/π. So |tan(k)| ≈ 2k/π, so tan(k)/k ≈ 2/π, so the terms are around 2/π in absolute value, and since there are infinitely many such terms, the series diverges because the terms don't approach zero.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the series diverges because the terms do not approach zero; instead, there are infinitely many terms where |tan(k)/k| is bounded below by a positive constant.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned \"Can be easily proved that the following series converges/diverges?\" and is looking for an easy proof. Maybe there's a simpler argument. Alternatively, maybe the density of the approximations is not needed, and it's sufficient to note that the limit inferior of |tan(k)| is unbounded, hence |tan(k)/k| doesn't approach zero.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if the terms tan(k)/k do not approach zero, then the series cannot converge. So if we can show that lim inf |tan(k)/k| > 0, then the series diverges. To show that tan(k) does not approach zero, and in fact, that |tan(k)| is frequently large.\n\nSince the integers k are dense modulo π (due to π being irrational), the sequence tan(k) is unbounded. Because for any N, there exists a k > N such that k is arbitrarily close to (2m+1)π/2 for some integer m, making |tan(k)| arbitrarily large. Therefore, there are infinitely many k where |tan(k)| > 1, so |tan(k)/k| > 1/k. But the harmonic series diverges, so by comparison test, if infinitely many terms are greater than 1/k, which is divergent, then the original series diverges as well. However, this isn't directly applicable because the comparison test requires that all terms are non-negative, and here the terms can be positive or negative. But if the absolute value of the terms, |tan(k)/k|, is not approaching zero, then the series cannot converge, even conditionally. Because for any series to converge (conditionally or absolutely), the terms must approach zero.\n\nTherefore, if we can show that lim sup |tan(k)/k| > 0, then the series diverges. Since we've established that there are infinitely many k with |tan(k)| ~ Ck for some constant C (from the approximation argument), then |tan(k)/k| ~ C, so the terms do not approach zero. Hence, the series diverges.\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n1. π is irrational, so the sequence {k mod π} is dense in [0, π).\n2. Therefore, there are infinitely many k such that k approaches (2m+1)π/2, leading to |tan(k)| becoming arbitrarily large.\n3. For these k, |tan(k)/k| does not approach zero but remains bounded below by a positive constant.\n4. Hence, the necessary condition for convergence (terms approaching zero) fails, so the series diverges.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the series diverges.",
