    "Content": "Let $A$ be a symmetric $n\\times n$ matrix. I found a method on the web to check if $A$ is positive definite : $A$ is positive-definite if  all the diagonal entries are positive, and\n  each diagonal entry is greater than the sum of the absolute values of all other entries in the corresponding row/column. I couldn't find a proof for this statement. I also couldn't find a reference in my linear algebra books. I've a few questions. How do we prove the above statement? Is the following slightly weaker statement true? A symmetric matrix $A$ is positive-definite if all the diagonal entries are positive, each diagonal entry is greater than or equal to the sum of the absolute values of all other entries in the corresponding row/column, and there exists one diagonal entry which is strictly greater than the sum of the absolute values of all other entries in the corresponding row/column.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "These matrices are called (strictly) diagonally dominant . The standard way to show they are positive definite is with the Gershgorin Circle Theorem . Your weaker condition does not give positive definiteness; a counterexample is $\n\\left[ \\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{matrix} \\right]\n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user provided an example, so I need to follow that. The original question is about checking if a symmetric matrix is positive-definite using certain diagonal dominance criteria, and they want to prove the statement and a weaker version.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions a symmetric matrix A of size n x n. The method to check positive-definiteness states two conditions: all diagonal entries are positive, and each diagonal entry is greater than the sum of absolute values of other entries in its row/column. Then there's a weaker condition where some diagonal entry is strictly greater.\n\nSo, for the assumptions, each should be a single property applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. A is an n×n symmetric matrix.\n2. All diagonal entries of A are positive.\n3. For each diagonal entry, it is greater than the sum of absolute values of all other entries in the corresponding row/column.\n4. (For the weaker statement) Each diagonal entry is greater than or equal to the sum of absolute values of other entries in its row/column.\n5. There exists at least one diagonal entry strictly greater than the sum of absolute values in its row/column.\n\nWait, but the problem has two parts: proving the original statement and the weaker one. The original problem includes both the main question and the weaker statement. So maybe I need to structure the assumptions for each part? But the example given only has one problem statement. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, they split into assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and then the problem statement. So here, the assumptions are all the conditions given for the problem.\n\nIn this case, the user's question is about proving that if a symmetric matrix A satisfies all diagonal entries positive and each diagonal entry greater than the sum of absolute values of other entries in the row/column, then A is positive-definite. Then the weaker version where instead each diagonal is >= sum, and at least one is strictly greater.\n\nBut the problem is split into two parts: the original statement and the weaker one. However, the example given in the prompt combines the problem into one. So perhaps the assumptions should include all conditions for both parts, but the problem statement includes both.\n\nWait, but the original user's problem on Math Stack Exchange is asking two things: how to prove the original statement and whether the weaker statement is true. So the formatted problem needs to capture both.\n\nBut the example given by the user in the prompt for the original problem had assumptions listed as two points, even though in the original problem, the assumption was that n is any integer (but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original). Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is any integer. But the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that's adding an assumption not present in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, no, maybe the example is different. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example had a hidden assumption, but the user restructured it. Wait, the original example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so there should be no assumption that n is divisible by 7. The formatted problem adds that assumption, which is not in the original. So maybe the example is wrong? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the instruction given.\n\nThe instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps in the example, the original problem had a mistake, but the formatted problem corrected it by adding assumptions. But I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that sometimes the problem may require additional assumptions that are not explicitly stated but necessary. However, in the given example, the original problem's answer requires that 91 divides the expression for all integers n, but 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem actually requires that n is such that the expression is divisible by both 7 and 13, hence n must satisfy some conditions. But maybe the example is incorrect. Anyway, perhaps I should proceed with the current problem.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nThe original question is about proving that a symmetric matrix A is positive-definite if all diagonals are positive and each diagonal entry is greater than the sum of the absolute values of other entries in the same row/column. Then, the weaker version is if diagonals are >= sum, and at least one is strictly greater.\n\nSo, to structure this:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- A is a symmetric n×n matrix.\n- All diagonal entries of A are positive.\n- For each diagonal entry A_{i,i}, it is greater than the sum of absolute values of all other entries in the i-th row/column.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is positive-definite.\n\nThen, for the weaker statement:\n\nAssumptions (if treated as a separate problem):\n\n- A is a symmetric n×n matrix.\n- All diagonal entries of A are positive.\n- For each diagonal entry A_{i,i}, it is greater than or equal to the sum of absolute values of all other entries in the i-th row/column.\n- There exists at least one diagonal entry A_{j,j} strictly greater than the sum of absolute values of all other entries in the j-th row/column.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is positive-definite.\n\nBut the user's question includes both the original statement and the weaker one. So how to present this? The example given in the prompt only had one problem, but here there are two related problems. However, the user wants the problem structured in the given format. The original question on Math Stack Exchange is asking two things: how to prove the original statement and whether the weaker statement is true.\n\nBut the format requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". So perhaps the assumptions would be the conditions for the original statement, and the problem is to prove A is positive-definite. Then, the weaker statement is another problem, so perhaps needs to be split into two separate entries. However, the user provided only one example where the problem is single. But the user's question is a single post asking both things. So maybe the formatted problem should include both parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement can be written as two parts, with their respective assumptions. But the given example only had one problem. Maybe the user expects that the assumptions include all the necessary conditions for both problems, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, present two separate Assumption and Problem blocks. But the user's example has one block. So perhaps the answer should capture both parts in one problem statement, mentioning both the original and the weaker version.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem should list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is the question.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem statement is:\n\nProblem: Prove that a symmetric matrix A is positive-definite if all diagonal entries are positive and each diagonal entry is greater than the sum of the absolute values of all other entries in the corresponding row/column. Additionally, determine if the weaker condition (each diagonal entry is at least the sum, with at least one strictly greater) also ensures positive-definiteness.\n\nBut the original question on Math Stack Exchange is asking two things: how to prove the original statement and whether the weaker statement is true. So the problem as structured would need to encapsulate both questions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps list the assumptions for the original problem and then the problem includes both parts. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a symmetric n×n matrix,\n- All diagonal entries of A are positive,\n- Each diagonal entry is greater than the sum of absolute values of all other entries in the corresponding row/column.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is positive-definite. Additionally, determine if the following weaker conditions also ensure positive-definiteness: all diagonal entries are positive, each diagonal entry is greater than or equal to the sum of absolute values of all other entries in the corresponding row/column, and there exists at least one diagonal entry strictly greater than the sum.\n\nBut the example provided by the user had separate assumptions and a single problem. So perhaps the problem part can include both questions, and the assumptions are for the first part, then the second part's assumptions are different. However, the format requires listing assumptions and the problem. Since the problem has two parts, perhaps the assumptions should include both sets. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to address both the original and the weaker statement, with their respective assumptions. However, the example didn't handle such a case. Maybe the best way is to split into two problems. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying one problem per entry. But the original question has two parts.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But following the example, which combined a problem with an added assumption (even though the original problem didn't have it), I need to proceed.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, as 91=13*7, and perhaps the expression is divisible by 91 for all integers n, but the user in the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. However, given that, perhaps the user's example is not accurate, but the instruction is to follow the format.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking two things: proof of the original statement and whether the weaker statement is true. But in the given format, we can only have one assumption block and one problem. So perhaps the problem part includes both questions, and the assumptions include all the conditions required for both. But that may not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem is structured as a single question asking two things, perhaps the formatted problem should include both as separate problems. But since the example does not do that, maybe we need to list the assumptions for the original statement and then the problem includes both parts. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a symmetric n×n matrix,\n- All diagonal entries of A are positive,\n- Each diagonal entry is greater than the sum of absolute values of all other entries in the corresponding row/column.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is positive-definite. Additionally, determine if A is positive-definite under the weaker conditions where each diagonal entry is at least the sum of absolute values of other entries in its row/column and at least one diagonal entry is strictly greater.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking two separate things: proving the first statement and whether the second (weaker) is true. So the problem is to address both. However, the assumptions listed are for the first part. The second part has different assumptions. Therefore, perhaps we need to structure two separate assumption-problem blocks. But the given example only uses one. This is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is presented as one question on Math Stack Exchange, perhaps the formatted version should capture both parts within the same problem statement, with the assumptions covering both cases. But that's not straightforward.\n\nGiven the example provided, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions for the original problem, then the problem is to prove the original statement and address the weaker one. But the example's problem line only states the main problem. So perhaps the problem should be phrased as:\n\nProblem: Prove that a symmetric matrix A satisfying the above assumptions is positive-definite. Additionally, determine if the weaker conditions (positive diagonals, each diagonal entry ≥ sum of absolute values of other entries in the row/column, and at least one diagonal entry strictly greater) also ensure positive-definiteness.\n\nBut the original example's problem line was a single statement. So maybe the answer should focus on the main problem and mention the weaker one as a secondary question. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the question, filter unrelated info, and structure as the format. The original question has two parts: proof of the original statement and the weaker one. So the formatted problem should include both.\n\nBut given the example, which combines the problem into one line, perhaps we need to structure both parts as one problem. Let me proceed with that.",
