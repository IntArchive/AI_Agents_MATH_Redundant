    "Content": "I am trying to find all positive integer solution $(x,y,z)$ of equation $x^4+5y^4=z^4$. Here I fould: $(x,y,z)=(1,2,3)$ and $(d,2d,3d)$. I try to prove if $(x,y)=1$ then $(1,2,3)$ is the unique solution of equation. Could anyone help me for this question?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I experimentally searched the possibility of more principal solutions for this equation. $x^4 +5y^4=z^4$ $z^4≡ x^4\\mod y^4$⇒ $x^4<y^4$ or $x<y$ $z^4≡ x^4\\mod 5$ ⇒ $x^4 < 5$; the only possible number for x is $1$, that is $x=1$⇒ $(y=2)$ and $z=3$ are the principal solutions. Also we may write: $(z^2+x^2)(z+x)(z-x)=5y^4$ Following cases can be considered: a: $z-x =2$, that is z and x are two consecutive odd or even numbers. One solution is already found i.e. $(z=3)$ and $(x =1)$ and $y=2$. I checked by Python up to $z=10^6$ and got no more solutions. b: $z-x=1$, that is x and z are two consecutive numbers. This can not be acceptable because $z>y>x$ i.e. the next consecutive number to x can only be y. c: $z-x=5$, and $(z^2+x^2)(z+x)=y^4$; I checked this up to $z=10^6$ and I got no result. c:$x+z=5$ that means:we have :$(x=1, z=4), (x=2, z=3), (x=3, z=2) and finally(x=4, z=1)$ which non of them give integer solution for y. d:$z^2+x^2=5$ , the possible values are $(x=1)$ and$( z=2)$ which do not give an integer solution for y. e: $z^2-x^2=5$ or $z^2+x^2=y^4$ I checked it up to $ z=10^6$ and could not found any integer solution for y. Conclusion: equation $x^4 +5y^4=z^4$ is one case of general equation of form $x^4 +Dy^4=z^4$ in which $D=5$ . Lagrange showed that this type of equation depending on certain values of D can have integer solutions in limited numbers.The equation $x^4 +5y^4=z^4$ is one of these equations that have only one set of principal solutions $(x=1, y=2, z=3)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to find all positive integer solutions to the equation \\( x^4 + 5y^4 = z^4 \\), and they've mentioned that when \\( (x, y) = 1 \\), the only solution is \\( (1, 2, 3) \\), and other solutions are multiples of that, like \\( (d, 2d, 3d) \\). The task is to prove that if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are coprime, then \\( (1, 2, 3) \\) is the unique solution.\n\nFirst, let me recall that Diophantine equations of the form \\( x^n + y^n = z^n \\) are related to Fermat's Last Theorem, but here we have coefficients and different exponents. In this case, it's a quartic equation with a coefficient 5 in front of the \\( y^4 \\) term. The user found a specific solution and its multiples. So, maybe the approach is to show that no other coprime solutions exist except this one.\n\nLet me start by checking the given solution. Plugging \\( x=1 \\), \\( y=2 \\), \\( z=3 \\):\n\nLeft-hand side: \\( 1^4 + 5*(2^4) = 1 + 5*16 = 1 + 80 = 81 \\).\n\nRight-hand side: \\( 3^4 = 81 \\). So it works. Now, multiplying each term by \\( d \\), we get \\( (d)^4 + 5*(2d)^4 = (3d)^4 \\), which simplifies to \\( d^4(1 + 5*16) = d^4*81 = (3d)^4 \\), so that works too. So these are valid solutions.\n\nNow, to prove that these are the only solutions when \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are coprime. Let's assume \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are coprime positive integers satisfying \\( x^4 +5y^4 = z^4 \\).\n\nOne approach might be to use modular arithmetic to find contradictions unless the solution is (1,2,3). Let's see. Let's consider modulo 5. Since the equation is \\( x^4 +5y^4 = z^4 \\), modulo 5, the term \\( 5y^4 \\) becomes 0, so \\( x^4 \\equiv z^4 \\mod 5 \\). By Fermat's little theorem, for any integer a, \\( a^4 \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\mod 5 \\). So possible residues are 0 or 1.\n\nTherefore, \\( x^4 \\equiv z^4 \\mod 5 \\). If \\( x \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\), then \\( z^4 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\), so \\( z \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\). Similarly, if \\( x \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\), then \\( x^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\), so \\( z^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\), so \\( z \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\).\n\nBut since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are coprime, if 5 divides \\( x \\), then 5 does not divide \\( y \\). But let's see. Suppose 5 divides \\( x \\), then \\( x =5a \\), so substituting into the equation:\n\n\\( (5a)^4 +5y^4 = z^4 \\implies 625a^4 +5y^4 = z^4 \\implies 5(125a^4 + y^4) = z^4 \\). Therefore, 5 divides \\( z^4 \\), which implies 5 divides \\( z \\), so \\( z=5b \\). Then substitute back:\n\n\\( 5(125a^4 + y^4) = (5b)^4 = 625b^4 \\implies 125a^4 + y^4 = 125b^4 \\implies y^4 = 125(b^4 - a^4) \\). So 125 divides \\( y^4 \\), which implies 5 divides \\( y \\). But this contradicts the assumption that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are coprime (since 5 divides both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)). Therefore, our initial assumption that 5 divides \\( x \\) is false. Therefore, \\( x \\) cannot be divisible by 5. Hence, \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) are not divisible by 5, so \\( x^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\), and \\( z^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\).\n\nSo from modulo 5, we get that \\( x \\equiv \\pm1 \\mod 5 \\) and \\( z \\equiv \\pm1 \\mod 5 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the original equation \\( x^4 +5y^4 = z^4 \\). Rearranged, this is \\( z^4 - x^4 =5y^4 \\). Factor the left side: \\( z^4 - x^4 = (z^2 +x^2)(z +x)(z -x) \\). So the equation becomes \\( (z^2 +x^2)(z +x)(z -x) =5y^4 \\).\n\nSince the product of these three factors is 5 times a fourth power, and 5 is prime, we can think about how 5 divides the factors. Also, since x and z are coprime with y (since x and y are coprime and z is expressed in terms of x and y), we might need to use that the factors on the left are pairwise coprime or have certain gcds.\n\nBut first, let's check the factors. Let me denote:\n\nA = z - x,\n\nB = z + x,\n\nC = z² + x².\n\nSo, A*B*C =5y⁴.\n\nWe need to see how 5 divides into these factors. Since x and z are not divisible by 5 (as we saw earlier), then z ± x might be divisible by 5. Let's check.\n\nSince z ≡ ±1 mod 5 and x ≡ ±1 mod 5. Let's see possible combinations:\n\nCase 1: z ≡1 mod5, x≡1 mod5. Then z -x ≡0 mod5.\n\nCase 2: z≡1 mod5, x≡-1 mod5. Then z -x ≡2 mod5, z +x ≡0 mod5.\n\nCase 3: z≡-1 mod5, x≡1 mod5. Then z -x ≡-2 mod5, z +x ≡0 mod5.\n\nCase4: z≡-1 mod5, x≡-1 mod5. Then z +x ≡-2 mod5, z -x ≡0 mod5.\n\nSo, depending on the residues, either z - x or z + x is divisible by 5. In Cases 1 and 4, z - x or z + x is 0 mod5. In Cases 2 and 3, z + x is 0 mod5. So, one of the factors A or B is divisible by 5. Let's suppose that either A or B is divisible by 5.\n\nAdditionally, since A = z - x, B = z + x, and C = z² + x², we need to check the gcd of these factors.\n\nLet’s compute gcd(A,B). Let d = gcd(z - x, z + x). Then d divides (z + x) + (z - x) = 2z and (z + x) - (z - x) = 2x. Since x and z are coprime? Wait, x and y are coprime, but what about x and z?\n\nWait, the original problem states that (x,y) =1. So x and y are coprime, but z is defined in terms of x and y. So z may share factors with x. For example, in the solution (1,2,3), z=3 and x=1 are coprime. But if x and z had a common divisor d>1, then d divides z^4 -x^4 =5y^4. Since d divides x and z, d divides 5y^4. But since x and y are coprime, d divides 5. But if d divides x and 5, and x and y are coprime, then d is 1 or 5. But earlier, we saw that x cannot be divisible by 5 (since that would lead to y being divisible by 5, which contradicts (x,y)=1). Therefore, d must be 1. Hence, x and z are coprime.\n\nTherefore, gcd(x,z) =1.\n\nTherefore, since d = gcd(z - x, z + x) divides 2z and 2x, and since gcd(x,z)=1, then d divides 2. So gcd(A,B) is either 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, gcd(A, C): Let's compute gcd(z - x, z² +x²). Let’s denote d = gcd(z - x, z² +x²). Then d divides z - x and z² +x². Let’s write z = x + k, then z² +x² = (x +k)^2 +x² = x² +2k x +k² +x² = 2x² +2k x +k². But since d divides z -x =k, then k ≡0 mod d. Therefore, substituting k = md, we get z² +x² =2x² +2(m d)x + (m d)^2. Therefore, d divides 2x². But since gcd(d, x)=1 (because d divides z -x and gcd(x,z)=1, so d divides (z -x) and gcd(d,x)=1), so d divides 2. Therefore, gcd(A,C) is 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, gcd(B,C) is 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, the factors A, B, C are pairwise coprime except for possible factors of 2. Since the product A*B*C =5y^4, and y is an integer. Given that A, B, C are pairwise coprime except for possible 2s, each factor must be a fourth power times a unit factor, or multiplied by 5.\n\nBut since 5 divides exactly one of A or B (as established earlier), let's suppose that 5 divides A or B. Let me consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 5 divides A = z - x.\n\nThen, since A is divisible by 5, and gcd(A,B) divides 2, so if A is divisible by 5, then B and C must be coprime to 5. Therefore, the equation A*B*C =5y^4 implies that exactly one of A, B, C is divisible by 5, which is A here. Therefore, A must be 5 times a fourth power, and B and C must be fourth powers (up to units). Similarly, since A and B and C are pairwise coprime up to 2s, perhaps we can write:\n\nLet’s write:\n\nA =5a^4,\n\nB =b^4,\n\nC =c^4,\n\nwhere a, b, c are positive integers, and gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,c)=gcd(a,c)=1.\n\nThen, 5a^4 * b^4 * c^4 =5y^4 => a^4 b^4 c^4 = y^4 => y=abc.\n\nBut also, we have:\n\nz -x =5a^4,\n\nz +x =b^4,\n\nz² +x² =c^4.\n\nFrom the first two equations:\n\nAdding z -x =5a^4 and z +x =b^4, we get:\n\n2z =5a^4 +b^4 => z=(5a^4 +b^4)/2,\n\nSubtracting: 2x =b^4 -5a^4 => x=(b^4 -5a^4)/2.\n\nSimilarly, from z² +x² =c^4.\n\nLet me plug in z and x into this equation:\n\n[(5a^4 +b^4)/2]^2 + [(b^4 -5a^4)/2]^2 =c^4.\n\nExpanding both squares:\n\nFirst term: (25a^8 +10a^4 b^4 +b^8)/4,\n\nSecond term: (b^8 -10a^4 b^4 +25a^8)/4,\n\nAdding them:\n\n(25a^8 +10a^4 b^4 +b^8 + b^8 -10a^4 b^4 +25a^8)/4 = (50a^8 +2b^8)/4 = (25a^8 +b^8)/2 =c^4.\n\nThus, 25a^8 +b^8 =2c^4.\n\nThis is a new equation: 25a^8 +b^8 =2c^4.\n\nWe need to find positive integers a, b, c satisfying this equation.\n\nSimilarly, since a, b, c are coprime (since A, B, C are coprime up to 2s, but since y=abc and x and y are coprime, maybe we can deduce more constraints).\n\nBut given that x=(b^4 -5a^4)/2, and x must be a positive integer, so b^4 -5a^4 must be even. Since b^4 and 5a^4 must have the same parity. 5a^4 is congruent to a^4 mod 2, since 5 is odd. So, if a is even, then a^4 is even, so 5a^4 is even. Then b^4 must be even, so b must be even. Similarly, if a is odd, then 5a^4 is odd, so b^4 must be odd, hence b is odd.\n\nBut since in this case, we assumed that 5 divides A = z -x, and given that x and z are coprime (as established earlier), but I need to check if a, b, c can be small.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this equation 25a^8 +b^8 =2c^4 has only trivial solutions. Let's check for small a and b.\n\nIf a=1:\n\n25(1)^8 +b^8 =25 +b^8 =2c^4.\n\nLooking for integer b and c such that 25 +b^8 is twice a fourth power.\n\nTrying b=1: 25 +1=26=2c^4 => c^4=13. Not integer.\n\nb=2:25+256=281. 281/2=140.5. Not integer.\n\nb=3:25+6561=6586. 6586/2=3293, which is not a perfect fourth power.\n\nSimilarly, b=0: 25+0=25=2c^4 => c^4=12.5. Not integer.\n\nSo no solution for a=1.\n\na=0: Not allowed since y=abc would be 0, but y is positive.\n\na=2:\n\n25*(256) +b^8 =6400 +b^8=2c^4.\n\nLooking for b such that 6400 +b^8 is twice a fourth power.\n\nb=2:6400 +256=6656. 6656/2=3328. 3328 is not a fourth power.\n\nb=4: 6400 +65536=71936. 71936/2=35968. Fourth root of 35968 is approx 13.7, not integer.\n\nNot promising.\n\na=3: 25*6561 +b^8=164025 +b^8=2c^4. Even larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no solutions except when a=0, which is invalid. So perhaps the only solution is when a=0, but a must be positive. Therefore, no solutions in this case.\n\nTherefore, Case 1 (5 divides A=z -x) leads to no solutions except trivial ones, which are invalid.\n\nCase 2: 5 divides B =z +x.\n\nSimilarly, proceeding as above:\n\nLet B=5b^4,\n\nA=a^4,\n\nC=c^4,\n\nThen, A*B*C=5b^4 *a^4 *c^4=5y^4 => y=abc.\n\nFrom A=z -x=a^4,\n\nB=z +x=5b^4,\n\nAdding: 2z= a^4 +5b^4 => z=(a^4 +5b^4)/2,\n\nSubtracting: 2x=5b^4 -a^4 => x=(5b^4 -a^4)/2.\n\nThen, z² +x² =c^4.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n[(a^4 +5b^4)/2]^2 + [(5b^4 -a^4)/2]^2 =c^4.\n\nExpanding:\n\nFirst term: (a^8 +10a^4 b^4 +25b^8)/4,\n\nSecond term: (25b^8 -10a^4 b^4 +a^8)/4,\n\nAdding:\n\n(a^8 +10a^4 b^4 +25b^8 +25b^8 -10a^4 b^4 +a^8)/4 = (2a^8 +50b^8)/4 = (a^8 +25b^8)/2 =c^4.\n\nSo, the equation becomes a^8 +25b^8=2c^4.\n\nAgain, we need to find positive integers a,b,c satisfying this.\n\nCheck small values:\n\na=1:\n\n1 +25b^8=2c^4.\n\nTry b=1: 1+25=26=2c^4 => c^4=13, no.\n\nb=2:1+25*256=1+6400=6401=2c^4 => c^4=3200.5, no.\n\nb=3:1+25*6561=1+164025=164026=2c^4 => c^4=82013, not a fourth power.\n\nSimilarly, b=0:1+0=1=2c^4 => c^4=0.5, invalid.\n\na=2:\n\n256 +25b^8=2c^4.\n\nTry b=1:256+25=281=2c^4 => c^4=140.5, no.\n\nb=2:256+25*256=256+6400=6656=2c^4 =>c^4=3328. Not a fourth power.\n\na=3:\n\n6561 +25b^8=2c^4.\n\nEven larger numbers, unlikely.\n\na=0: Not allowed.\n\nSo again, no solutions except possibly trivial.\n\nBut wait, in the given solution (1,2,3), let's see if it fits into this case.\n\nOriginal equation: x=1, y=2, z=3.\n\nCheck if 5 divides B=z +x=3+1=4. No, 4 is not divisible by 5. Therefore, this solution does not come from Case 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this solution comes from a different approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the factors A, B, C are fourth powers is too restrictive. Because maybe they are not necessarily fourth powers themselves but products of factors that multiply to 5y^4, with certain exponents.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the product A*B*C=5y^4, and since A, B, C are pairwise coprime (except for possible factors of 2), and 5 divides exactly one of them, we can distribute the prime factors.\n\nSince 5 divides either A or B, let's consider each case again.\n\nBut maybe another approach is needed. Let's try to use infinite descent.\n\nAssume that there is a solution with minimal z. Then, show that there must be a smaller solution, leading to a contradiction unless it's the trivial solution.\n\nAlternatively, use properties of Pythagorean quadruples or parametrize the solutions.\n\nAlternatively, look at the equation modulo 16 or another modulus to find restrictions.\n\nLet’s try modulo 16. Since 4th powers modulo 16 are either 0 or 1. For odd numbers, (2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 +24k^2 +8k +1 ≡1 mod16. Even numbers: (2k)^4=16k^4≡0 mod16.\n\nSo, x^4 mod16 is 0 or 1, 5y^4 mod16 is 0 or 5, z^4 mod16 is 0 or1.\n\nSo possible cases:\n\nIf x is even: x^4≡0, then 5y^4 ≡z^4 mod16. So 5y^4 ≡0 or1.\n\nIf y is even: 5y^4≡0 mod16, so z^4≡0 mod16 ⇒ z even. But x and y are both even? But x and y are coprime, so they cannot both be even. Therefore, if x is even, y must be odd, and 5y^4≡5 mod16. Thus z^4≡5 mod16. But z^4 can only be 0 or1 mod16, which is impossible. Hence, x cannot be even.\n\nSimilarly, if x is odd: x^4≡1 mod16. Then 5y^4 ≡z^4 -1 mod16.\n\nIf y is even: y is even ⇒ y^4≡0 mod16 ⇒5y^4≡0 mod16 ⇒z^4≡1 mod16 ⇒z odd. So possible: x odd, y even, z odd.\n\nIf y is odd: y^4≡1 mod16 ⇒5y^4≡5 mod16 ⇒z^4≡1+5=6 mod16. But z^4 can only be 0 or1 mod16, impossible. Therefore, y must be even.\n\nTherefore, in any solution with x and y coprime, x must be odd and y must be even. That matches the given solution (1,2,3).\n\nSo y is even, let’s set y=2k. Then the equation becomes x^4 +5*(16k^4)=z^4 ⇒x^4 +80k^4=z^4.\n\nSo z^4 -x^4=80k^4.\n\nFactorizing again: (z² +x²)(z +x)(z -x)=80k^4=16*5k^4.\n\nNow, since x is odd and z is also odd (from modulo16 analysis), z ±x are even. Indeed, z and x are both odd, so z ±x are even. Therefore, A=z -x and B=z +x are both even. Let’s write A=2a, B=2b. Then:\n\nA*B=4ab. Then, the product becomes:\n\n(4ab)(z² +x²)=80k^4 ⇒4ab(z² +x²)=80k^4 ⇒ab(z² +x²)=20k^4.\n\nNow, since z and x are odd, z² +x² ≡1+1=2 mod4, so z² +x² is even. Let’s write z² +x²=2c². Wait, but z² +x²=2c² would imply that c²=(z² +x²)/2. However, this may not necessarily be a square. But let's see:\n\nSince z and x are odd, let’s write z = x + 2d. Wait, since A=z -x=2a, so z =x +2a. Then, z +x=2b ⇒x +2a +x=2b ⇒2x +2a=2b ⇒x +a =b ⇒x =b -a.\n\nSo, z =x +2a= (b -a) +2a= b +a.\n\nTherefore, z =a +b, x =b -a. Since x is positive, b >a.\n\nNow, z² +x²=(a +b)^2 + (b -a)^2= a² +2ab +b² +a² -2ab +b²=2a² +2b²=2(a² +b²).\n\nTherefore, z² +x²=2(a² +b²). Therefore, plugging back into the equation:\n\nab*2(a² +b²)=20k^4 ⇒ab(a² +b²)=10k^4.\n\nSo, ab(a² +b²)=10k^4.\n\nNow, since x =b -a and z =b +a, and x and y are coprime, and y=2k, we need to consider the coprimality of a and b.\n\nSince x =b -a and z =b +a, gcd(x,z) =gcd(b -a, b +a)=gcd(b -a, 2a). Since x and y are coprime, and y=2k, gcd(b -a,2k)=1.\n\nBut this might be getting complicated. Let's see.\n\nSince ab(a² +b²)=10k^4, and 10=2*5, so we can analyze the prime factors.\n\nGiven that a and b are positive integers with b >a, and coprime? Wait, if gcd(a,b)=d, then d divides x =b -a and z =b +a. Since x and z are coprime (from earlier), then d must be 1. Therefore, a and b are coprime.\n\nTherefore, gcd(a,b)=1.\n\nThus, a and b are coprime, and ab(a² +b²)=10k^4.\n\nSince a and b are coprime, then a, b, and a² +b² are pairwise coprime except for possible factors of 2.\n\nWait, since a and b are coprime, a² +b² is coprime to both a and b, unless both a and b are odd, which would make a² +b² even.\n\nBut since x =b -a and z =b +a are both even (since x and z are odd? Wait, no, earlier analysis showed x and z are both odd. Wait, but in this case, since a and b are coprime, and x =b -a, z =b +a.\n\nIf a and b are both odd, then x and z are even, but earlier we concluded x and z are odd. Contradiction. Therefore, a and b must be of opposite parity.\n\nSince a and b are coprime and of opposite parity, one is even and the other is odd. Therefore, a and b are coprime with one even and one odd.\n\nThus, ab is even, so 2 divides ab.\n\nLet’s denote a=2m if a is even, or b=2m if b is even. Let’s assume without loss of generality that a is even and b is odd. Then, a=2m, b is odd, and gcd(2m,b)=1.\n\nThen, ab(a² +b²)=2m*b*(4m² +b²)=10k^4.\n\nThus, 2m*b*(4m² +b²)=10k^4 ⇒m*b*(4m² +b²)=5k^4.\n\nNow, since m and b are coprime (since a=2m and b are coprime, and m and b are also coprime), and 4m² +b² is coprime to both m and b.\n\nBecause:\n\ngcd(m,4m² +b²)=gcd(m,b²)=1 (since gcd(m,b)=1).\n\ngcd(b,4m² +b²)=gcd(b,4m²)=1 (since gcd(b,m)=1).\n\nTherefore, m, b, and 4m² +b² are pairwise coprime.\n\nTherefore, their product m*b*(4m² +b²)=5k^4.\n\nSince they are pairwise coprime, each must be a fourth power times a unit factor. Also, the prime factors on the left are 5 and possibly others. But since the product is 5 times a fourth power, we have that one of m, b, or 4m² +b² must be 5 times a fourth power, and the others must be fourth powers.\n\nSo, three possibilities:\n\n1. m=5d^4, b=e^4, 4m² +b²=f^4.\n\n2. m=d^4, b=5e^4, 4m² +b²=f^4.\n\n3. m=d^4, b=e^4, 4m² +b²=5f^4.\n\nLet’s check each case.\n\nCase 1: m=5d^4, b=e^4, 4m² +b²=f^4.\n\nPlug in m=5d^4:\n\n4*(25d^8) +e^8=100d^8 +e^8=f^4.\n\nLooking for integers d,e,f. Try small d.\n\nd=1:\n\n100*1 +e^8=100 +e^8=f^4.\n\nLooking for e such that e^8 +100 is a fourth power. e=1:1+100=101, not a fourth power. e=2:256+100=356, no. e=3:6561+100=6661, no. No solutions.\n\nd=0: m=0 invalid.\n\nCase 2: m=d^4, b=5e^4, 4m² +b²=f^4.\n\nPlug in:\n\n4d^8 +25e^8=f^4.\n\nLooking for d,e,f. Again, small d:\n\nd=1:4 +25e^8=f^4.\n\ne=1:29, not a fourth power. e=2:4+25*256=4+6400=6404. 6404=4*1601, which is not a fourth power. Similarly no solutions.\n\nCase 3: m=d^4, b=e^4, 4m² +b²=5f^4.\n\nSo, 4d^8 +e^8=5f^4.\n\nLooking for integers d,e,f. Let's try small values.\n\nd=1:\n\n4 +e^8=5f^4.\n\nLooking for e such that e^8 ≡1 mod5 (since 5f^4 ≡0 mod5, so 4 +e^8 ≡0 mod5 ⇒e^8 ≡1 mod5. Since e^4 ≡0 or1 mod5, so e^8=(e^4)^2≡0 or1 mod5. Thus, e^8 ≡1 mod5 ⇒e ≡±1 mod5.\n\nTry e=1:4+1=5=5*1^4 ⇒f=1. So d=1,e=1,f=1.\n\nThus, m=d^4=1, b=e^4=1. So a=2m=2, b=1. Then, x=b -a=1 -2= -1, which is invalid since x must be positive. Contradiction.\n\nNext, e=2: e=2, which is 2 mod5. But e^8=256 ≡1 mod5 (since 2^4=16≡1, so 2^8=256≡1). So e=2:4 +256=260=5f^4 ⇒f^4=52. Not integer.\n\ne=3:3^8=6561≡1^2=1 mod5 (since 3^4=81≡1). So 4+6561=6565=5f^4 ⇒f^4=1313. Not integer.\n\ne=4:4^8=65536≡(-1)^8=1 mod5. 4+65536=65540=5*13108. 13108 not a fourth power.\n\ne=5:5^8=390625≡0 mod5. So 4+0=4≡0 mod5? No, 4≡4 mod5≠0. So invalid.\n\ne=6: same as e=1 mod5. e=6: e=6 ⇒e=1 mod5. e=6:4 +6^8=4 + 1679616=1679620=5*335924. 335924 is not a fourth power.\n\nSimilarly, e=7 (2 mod5), e=8 (3 mod5), etc., no luck.\n\nAlternatively, d=0: invalid.\n\nNext, d=2:\n\n4*(256) +e^8=1024 +e^8=5f^4.\n\nRequires e^8=5f^4 -1024. For e=4: 65536=5f^4 -1024 ⇒5f^4=66560 ⇒f^4=13312, not fourth power.\n\nSimilarly, no solutions.\n\nd=1, e=1 gives the only solution but leads to negative x. So invalid.\n\nThus, only possible solution in Case3 is d=1,e=1,f=1, but gives invalid x.\n\nTherefore, none of the cases yield valid solutions except the trivial one leading to x negative. Hence, the only possible solution is when a and b are such that k=0, which is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that there are no solutions other than the trivial ones, which would imply that the only solution with (x,y)=1 is (1,2,3), as required.\n\nTherefore, the proof would involve showing through these modular constraints and factorization that no other solutions exist except the given ones.",
