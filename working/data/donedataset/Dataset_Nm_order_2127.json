    "Content": "I'm trying to prove that for $p,q>0$, we have $$\\int_0^1t^{p-1}(1-t)^{q-1}\\,dt=\\frac{\\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(q)}{\\Gamma(p+q)}.$$ The hint given suggests that we express $\\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(q)$ as a double integral, then do a change of variables, but I've been unable thus far to express it as a double integral. Can anyone get me started or suggest an alternate approach? Note : This wasn't actually given to me as the $\\Gamma$ function, just as a function $f$ satisfying $$f(p)=\\int_0^\\infty e^{-t}t^{p-1}\\,dt$$ for all $p>0$, but I recognized that. This is in the context of an advanced calculus practice exam.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Indeed, to show this identity, one can start from the double integral \n$$\n\\Gamma(p)\\cdot\\Gamma(q)=\\int_0^\\infty \\mathrm e^{-x}x^{p-1}\\,\\mathrm dx\\cdot\\int_0^\\infty \\mathrm e^{-y}y^{q-1}\\,\\mathrm dy=\\iint_{[0,+\\infty)^2} \\mathrm e^{-x-y}x^{p-1}y^{q-1}\\,\\mathrm dx\\,\\mathrm dy.\n$$\nThe change of variable $x=ts$, $y=(1-t)s$, with $0\\leqslant t\\leqslant1$ and $s\\geqslant0$, whose Jacobian yields $\\mathrm dx\\,\\mathrm dy=s\\,\\mathrm ds\\,\\mathrm dt$, shows that\n$$\n\\Gamma(p)\\cdot\\Gamma(q)=\\int_0^{+\\infty}\\int_0^1\\mathrm e^{-s}t^{p-1}s^{p-1}(1-t)^{q-1}s^{q-1}s\\,\\mathrm ds\\,\\mathrm dt.\n$$\nFinally,\n$$\\Gamma(p)\\cdot\\Gamma(q)=\\int_0^{+\\infty}\\mathrm e^{-s}s^{p+q-1}\\,\\mathrm ds\\cdot\\int_0^1t^{p-1}(1-t)^{q-1}\\,\\mathrm dt=\\Gamma(p+q)\\cdot\\int_0^1t^{p-1}(1-t)^{q-1}\\,\\mathrm dt,\n$$\nand this is it. The last integral above is called the beta number $\\mathrm B(p,q)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified structure. The original problem is about proving that the integral from 0 to 1 of t^(p-1)(1-t)^(q-1) dt equals Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p+q) for positive p and q.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that p and q are positive. The integral is from 0 to 1, and the function inside the integral is t^(p-1)(1-t)^(q-1). The question mentions using a double integral for Γ(p)Γ(q) and a change of variables, but the user wants the problem structured without the extra info.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each condition. Since p and q are both positive, each should be a separate assumption. The integral's limits and integrand are part of the problem statement, but since the problem is to prove the equality, those might not be assumptions but part of the problem itself. Wait, the example given had assumptions about the variable (like n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the main conditions are p and q being positive. The function f is defined via the integral from 0 to infinity for f(p), but in the problem, the integral is from 0 to 1. However, the note mentions that f(p) is the Gamma function, but the problem statement doesn't require assuming that; the problem is to show the integral equals Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p+q). So the key assumptions are p and q being positive. The rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nSo in the Assumption section, it should list that p is positive, q is positive. Then the problem is the integral equality. The note about the Gamma function is part of the original question's context but the user wants to filter unrelated info. The problem as presented in the title and the question is to prove the integral equals the ratio of Gamma functions. Therefore, the assumptions are p and q being positive, each on their own line. The problem is to show the integral equals that expression.",
