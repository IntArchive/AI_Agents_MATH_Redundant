    "Content": "My lab friends always play a mentally challenging brain game every month to keep our mind running on all four cylinders and the last month challenge was to find a novelty expression for $\\pi$. In order to stick to the rule, of course we must avoid the good old Ramanujan and online available expressions, for instance: the coolest ways of expressing $\\pi$ on Quora. The winner of the last month challenge is this integral $${\\large\\int_0^\\infty}\\frac{(1+x)\\log(1+x)(2+\\log x)\\log\\left(\\!\\frac{1+x}{2}\\!\\right)-2x\\log(1+x)\\log x}{x^{3/2}(1+x)\\log^2x}\\ dx={\\Large\\pi}$$ The equality is precise to at least thousand decimal places. Unfortunately, my friend who proposes this integral keeping the mystery to himself. I tried to crack this integral while waiting for a solution to be offered by one of my friends, but failed to get any. I have tried to break this integral into two part: $${\\large\\int_0^\\infty}\\frac{\\log(1+x)(2+\\log x)\\log\\left(\\!\\frac{1+x}{2}\\!\\right)}{x^{3/2}\\log^2x}\\ dx-2{\\large\\int_0^\\infty}\\frac{\\log(1+x)}{\\sqrt{x}(1+x)\\log x}\\ dx$$ but each integrals diverges. I have tried many substitutions like $x=y-1$, $x=\\frac{1}{y}$, or $x=\\tan^2y$ hoping for familiar functions, but couldn't get one. I also tried the method of differentiation under integral sign by introducing $$I(s)={\\large\\int_0^\\infty}x^{s}\\cdot\\frac{(1+x)\\log(1+x)(2+\\log x)\\log\\left(\\!\\frac{1+x}{2}\\!\\right)-2x\\log(1+x)\\log x}{(1+x)\\log^2x}\\ dx$$ and differentiating twice with respect to $s$ to get rid of $\\log^2x$ couldn't work either. I have a strong feeling that I miss something completely obvious in my calculation. I'm not having much success in evaluating this integral since two weeks ago, so I thought it's about time to ask you for help. Can you help me out to prove it, please?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a complex integral that supposedly equals π, and they want to structure it according to the given format. First, I need to parse the original question and filter out any unrelated information. The key points here are the integral expression and the fact that it equals π. The user mentioned some attempts like splitting the integral and substitutions, but those are part of their process, not the problem's assumptions. The actual problem statement is the integral itself and proving it equals π. There are no explicit assumptions given in the problem other than the integral being from 0 to infinity and the integrand's structure. However, sometimes in integrals, especially involving logarithms and limits, there might be implicit assumptions about convergence or conditions on variables. But in this case, the user states the equality is precise to at least a thousand decimal places, suggesting the integral converges. The problem doesn't specify any particular conditions on variables beyond the integration limits. So the main assumption here is just the structure of the integrand and the limits of integration. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the integral as given and state that it equals π. The user didn't mention any specific conditions like parameters or constraints, so the assumptions section might be minimal here. Wait, the example given in the problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the integral doesn't have variables like n; it's a definite integral. Therefore, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the integral's form. However, maybe there's an implicit assumption that the integral is convergent, but since the user verified it numerically, maybe that's not necessary. So the problem is simply to prove that the integral equals π. The assumptions would just be the integral's structure and the limits. Hmm, but according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Since the problem is to evaluate the integral, perhaps the only assumption is the integral's definition. But in the example, they listed n is an integer and n divisible by 7 as two separate assumptions. Here, the integral is defined from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. But since the problem is to prove the integral equals π, maybe there are no additional assumptions. However, the user mentioned that splitting into two parts leads to divergent integrals, but the original integral converges. So maybe an assumption is that the integral converges? But the user states it equals π accurately, so perhaps convergence is part of the problem. But how to structure that. Alternatively, maybe there's an assumption that the integrand is as given. Wait, the example had assumptions about the variable n. Here, there's no variable; it's a definite integral. So perhaps the only assumption is the integrand's form and the limits. But according to the format, each assumption should be listed line by line. Since the integral is a single object, maybe the assumptions are: the integral is from 0 to infinity, the integrand is [expression], and the integral converges. But the user didn't state convergence as an assumption; they just said the equality holds. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the integral's structure is the assumption. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions needed here except the integral's definition. Since the problem is to prove the integral equals π, and the user provided the exact integrand, the assumptions would be the integrand's form and the integration limits. So, structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken from 0 to infinity,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{(1+x)\\log(1+x)(2+\\log x)\\log\\left(\\frac{1+x}{2}\\right)-2x\\log(1+x)\\log x}{x^{3/2}(1+x)\\log^2x}\\),\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals \\(\\pi\\).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were properties of n. Here, the integral is the main object. But since the problem is to evaluate the integral, maybe the only assumption is the definition of the integral. However, the example split into two assumptions for n. Similarly, perhaps here we need to split the integrand into parts? No, the problem is the entire integral. Alternatively, the assumptions could be:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integrand is defined as \\(\\frac{(1+x)\\log(1+x)(2+\\log x)\\log\\left(\\frac{1+x}{2}\\right)-2x\\log(1+x)\\log x}{x^{3/2}(1+x)\\log^2x}\\).\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So the first assumption is the domain of integration, and the second is the integrand's expression. So that's two lines. The problem is to prove the integral equals π. That seems to fit the format. Alternatively, maybe the integrand's expression can be split into components, but that's complicating. The problem states the integral as a single expression, so the integrand as given is one assumption. The integration limits are another. So yes, two assumptions. However, in the example, the problem was about proving divisibility, and the assumptions were about n. Here, the problem is to compute an integral, so the assumptions are the integral's definition. So I think that's correct.",
