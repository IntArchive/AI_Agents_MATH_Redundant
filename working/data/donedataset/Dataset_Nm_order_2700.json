    "Content": "I came across this while considering the subset sum problem in relation to another problem. Define the ratio, $$R(n,k) = \\frac{\\binom n k}{n^{k-1}}$$ and the integer sequence with initial $k=1$ , $$s_k = k!+\\frac{k(k-1)}{2} = 1, 3, 9, 30, 130, 735,\\dots$$ Q: How do we show that, $$\\begin{aligned}\nR\\big(n,\\,k\\big)\\; &< 1,\\quad\\text{if}\\;n < s_k\\\\\nR\\big(n,\\,k\\big)\\; &\\geq 1,\\quad\\text{if}\\;n \\geq s_k\n\\end{aligned}$$ Examples. Let $k=5\\,$ so $s_5 = 130$ , then, $$\\begin{aligned}\nR\\big(129,\\,5\\big)\\; &=\\frac{\\binom{129}{5}}{129^4} = 0.9939\\dots\\\\[5pt]\nR\\big(130,\\,5\\big)\\; &=\\frac{\\binom{130}{5}}{130^4} = 1.0022\\dots\n\\end{aligned}$$ Let $k=6\\,$ so $s_6 = 735$ , then, $$\\begin{aligned}\nR\\big(734,\\,6\\big)\\; &=\\frac{\\binom{734}{6}}{734^5} = 0.99877\\dots\\\\[5pt]\nR\\big(735,\\,6\\big)\\; &=\\frac{\\binom{735}{6}}{735^5} = 1.00016\\dots\n\\end{aligned}$$ and so on. Update. Note that: $$t_k = \\frac{2\\,s_k}{k} = 2, 3, 6, 15, 52, 245,\\dots$$ is A370888 (added 2024), or the 5-card trick, with maximum deck size $52$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's an outline of a solution.  Fix $k$; we seek the unique (possibly non-integral) $n>k$ such that ${n\\choose k}=n^{k-1}$.  Expanding the left-hand side, we have\n$$ n^k - {k\\choose 2}n^{k-1} + {\\rm error} = k!\\, n^{k-1}$$\nIf the error term weren't there, this would give $n = k! + {k\\choose 2}$.  We'll show that the error is between zero and $n^{k-1}$. To do this, we have to look more closely at the polynomial $$n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1) = n^k - c_1 n^{k-1} + c_2 n^{k-2} - \\cdots$$\nwhere $c_r$ is the sum of the products of all $r$-subsets of $\\{0,\\ldots,k-1\\}$.\nIt's easy to see that for each $r$, we have\n$c_r < k^2 c_{r-1}$; this is because each $(r-1)$-subset can be extended to an $r$-subset\nin less than $k$ ways, and each such extension increases the product by less than $k$. We'll assume $k>6$, so that $k^4<k!<n$. Then $c_r < k^2 c_{r-1} < n c_{r-1}$, so that\n$n^k - c_1 n^{k-1} + c_2 n^{k-2} -\\cdots$ is an alternating sum of terms whose absolute value decreases.  Thus we have $$n^k - c_1 n^{k-1} < n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1) < n^k - c_1 n^{k-1} + c_2 n^{k-2}$$ We have $c_1={k\\choose 2}$ and $c_2< k^2{k\\choose2}<k^4 < n$, so we get\n$$n^k - c_1 n^{k-1} < n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1) < n^k - c_1 n^{k-1} + n^{k-1},$$\ni.e. the \"error\" is sandwiched between $0$ and $n^{k-1}$ as claimed. To see that this finishes the argument, recall that we chose $n$ in order that ${n\\choose k}=n^{k-1}$.  So $n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1)=k!n^{k-1}$, so the \"sandwiching\" inequality says\n$$n^k - c_1 n^{k-1} < k! n^{k-1} < n^k - c_1 n^{k-1} + n^{k-1}.$$\nDividing all 3 sides by $n^{k-1}$, and adding $c_1={k\\choose 2}$ to all 3 sides, this gives\n$$n < k! + {k\\choose2} < n+1,$$\ni.e. $s_k-1<n<s_k$.\nObserving that ${n\\choose k}/n^{k-1}$ is increasing in $n$, for $n>k$, this implies that for $n=s_k-1$ the ratio is less than 1, and for $n=s_k$ the ratio is greater than 1. This gives the result for $k>6$; smaller values can be checked by hand.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about when the binomial coefficient ratio R(n,k) = C(n,k)/n^{k-1} is greater than or less than 1, depending on n relative to a sequence s_k. The problem states that if n is less than s_k, then R(n,k) is less than 1, and if n is greater or equal to s_k, then R(n,k) is at least 1. The example given is for k=5 and k=6, where s_5=130 and s_6=735, and they show specific values of R(n,k) just below and above s_k.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this problem into the required format. Let me identify the assumptions. The problem defines R(n,k) as C(n,k)/n^{k-1}. The sequence s_k is defined as k! + k(k-1)/2. The user wants to show that R(n,k) <1 when n < s_k and R(n,k) ≥1 when n ≥ s_k. The examples provided are for k=5 and k=6, but those are just illustrations. \n\nAssumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So the first assumption is the definition of R(n,k): the ratio of the binomial coefficient over n^{k-1}. Then the definition of s_k as k! + k(k-1)/2. Then the conditions on n relative to s_k for the inequalities. But wait, the problem is to show that for any k, when n is less than s_k, the ratio is less than 1, and when n is at least s_k, the ratio is at least 1. So the assumptions would include the definitions of R(n,k) and s_k, and perhaps that k is a positive integer? The problem says \"the integer sequence with initial k=1\", so k starts at 1. So k is a positive integer. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- R(n, k) = binomial(n, k) / n^{k - 1},\n- s_k = k! + k(k - 1)/2,\n- k is a positive integer,\n- n is an integer.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify if n has to be an integer, but since binomial(n,k) is defined for integers n ≥k, but maybe in the problem n is considered as an integer. The examples given use integer n. So perhaps n is an integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- R(n, k) is defined as binomial coefficient of n choose k divided by n raised to the power of k−1.\n- s_k is defined as k factorial plus k times (k minus 1) divided by 2.\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n is an integer such that n ≥k (since binomial(n,k) is zero otherwise, but in the problem examples, n is larger than k. For k=5, n=129,130, etc. So perhaps n ≥k is part of the context. However, the problem states n can be less than s_k, but s_k for k=1 is 1! + 0 =1, so n has to be at least 1 when k=1. But perhaps the problem implicitly assumes n is a positive integer. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n- For each positive integer k,\n- s_k is defined as k! + [k(k - 1)]/2,\n- R(n, k) = C(n, k)/n^{k - 1},\n- n is an integer with n ≥k.\n\nBut the problem doesn't explicitly state n ≥k, but in the examples, n is 129,130 for k=5, which is ≥5. However, the problem statement might need to have n ≥k for C(n,k) to be non-zero, but maybe the original question allows n to be any integer, but in the examples, n is larger. Wait, looking at the original question's title: \"When is the binomial ratio... >1?\" So perhaps n and k are positive integers with n ≥k. So perhaps that's an assumption. The problem in the example uses k=5, n=129, which is greater than k. So maybe the assumptions include that n and k are positive integers with n ≥k.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user says \"the integer sequence with initial k=1\", so k starts at 1, implying that k is a positive integer, and n is varying for each k. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is a positive integer,\n- For each k, s_k = k! + k(k - 1)/2,\n- R(n, k) = binomial(n, k) / n^{k - 1},\n- n is an integer such that n ≥k.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"if n < s_k\" and \"if n ≥ s_k\", so s_k might be greater than k. For example, s_1=1! + 0=1, so for k=1, n ≥1 would include n=1, which is s_1. But for k=2, s_2=2! + 1=3, so n needs to be ≥3 to have R(n,2) ≥1. Wait, but for k=2, binomial(n,2)/n^{1} = [n(n-1)/2]/n = (n-1)/2. So R(n,2)=(n-1)/2. So when is that ≥1? When (n-1)/2 ≥1 → n ≥3. Which matches s_2=3. So for k=2, the threshold is n=3. Similarly for k=1, R(n,1)= binomial(n,1)/n^{0} =n/1 =n. So R(n,1)=n. So for k=1, s_1=1. So the statement is R(n,1) <1 if n <1 (which would be n=0, but n ≥k=1, so n can't be less than 1. Wait, perhaps the original problem allows n to be any integer, but in practice, binomial(n,k) is zero if n <k. But in the problem statement, when k=5, they use n=129,130 which are ≥5, so perhaps the problem is considering n ≥k. But the user didn't explicitly state that. However, since the ratio involves binomial(n,k), which is zero when n <k, but in the examples, they have n=129 for k=5, which is greater. But the problem says \"for n < s_k\", which could be n < s_k but n ≥k. So perhaps the problem assumes n is an integer greater than or equal to k. Therefore, the assumptions should include that n is an integer ≥k. However, the problem's original question doesn't specify that, but the examples do. So to structure the problem correctly, the assistant must extract the assumptions. \n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- For each k, s_k = k! + [k(k - 1)]/2.\n- R(n, k) is defined as the binomial coefficient C(n, k) divided by n raised to the power (k - 1).\n- The problem considers integer values of n.\n\nBut wait, the problem might not state that n must be an integer, but the examples use integers. However, binomial coefficients are defined for integers n ≥k. So perhaps the problem is implicitly assuming n is an integer ≥k. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is a positive integer,\n- For each k, s_k is defined as k! + k(k - 1)/2,\n- R(n, k) is defined as C(n, k) / n^{k - 1},\n- n is an integer with n ≥k.\n\nNow, the problem is to show that R(n,k) <1 if n < s_k and R(n,k) ≥1 if n ≥s_k.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is a positive integer,\n- For each k, s_k = k! + [k(k - 1)]/2,\n- R(n, k) = C(n, k)/n^{k - 1},\n- n is an integer with n ≥k.\n\nProblem:\nShow that:\n- If n < s_k, then R(n, k) < 1,\n- If n ≥ s_k, then R(n, k) ≥ 1.\n\nBut the original problem uses \"if n < s_k\" and \"if n ≥ s_k\". So yes, that's the problem statement. The examples are just illustrations. The update mentions t_k = 2s_k/k being a sequence, but that's probably extra info not needed for the problem structure. So filtered out. The subset sum problem reference is also extra. So the final formatted problem should include the assumptions as above and the problem as stated.",
