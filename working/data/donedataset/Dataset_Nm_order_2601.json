    "Content": "In classical geometry an ellipse is usually defined as the locus of points in the plane such that the distances from each point to the two foci have a given sum. When we speak of an ellipse analytically, we usually describe it as a circle that has been squashed in one direction, i.e. something similar to the curve $x^2+(y/b)^2 = 1$. \"Everyone knows\" that these two definitions yield the same family of shapes. But how can that be proved?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose we have a classical ellipse with its two foci and major axis given. We want to prove that it's a squashed circle. Select a coordinate system with its origin in the center if the ellipse, the $x$-axis passing through the foci, and a scale such that the common sum-of-distances-to-the-foci is $2$. The foci have coordinates $(\\pm c,0)$ for some $c\\in[0,1)$. By considering the nodes at the end of the minor axis we find that the semiminor axis of the ellipse must be $b=\\sqrt{1-c^2}$. We must then prove that the equations\n$$ \\tag{1} x^2 + \\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{1-c^2}}\\right)^2 = 1 $$\n$$ \\tag{2} \\sqrt{(x+c)^2+y^2} + \\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2} = 2 $$\nare equivalent. Rearranging (1) gives\n$$\\tag{1'} y^2 = (1-c^2)(1-x^2) $$\nand therefore $(x+c)^2+y^2 = (1+xc)^2$ by multiplying out each side and collecting terms. Similarly, $(x-c)^2+y^2=(1-xc)^2$. So for points where (1) holds, (2) reduces to $(1+xc)+(1-xc)=2$, which is of course true. Thus every solution of (1) is a solution of (2). On the other hand, for every fixed $x\\in(-1,1)$, it is clear that the left-hand-side of (2) increases monotonically with $|y|$ so it can have at most two solutions, which must then be exactly the two solutions for $y$ we get from (1'). (And neither equation has solutions with $|x|>1$). So the equations are indeed equivalent. Conversely, if we have a squashed circle with major and minor axes $2a$ and $2b$, we can find the focal distance $2c$ by $c^2+b^2=a^2$ and locate the foci on the major axis. Then the above argument shows that the classical ellipse with these foci coincides with our squashed circle.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the example provided. The original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was simplified.\n\nNow, looking at the Math Stack Exchange question: The user is asking why the two definitions of an ellipse (the locus of points with a constant sum of distances to two foci and the squashed circle defined by x² + (y/b)² = 1) are equivalent. They want to know how to prove they result in the same shapes.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem involves two definitions of an ellipse. The first definition is the classical geometric one: points where the sum of distances to two foci is constant. The second is the analytical definition as a stretched or squashed circle, given by the equation x² + (y/b)² = 1. \n\nSo, the assumptions here are about each definition. Each assumption should address one property applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\n1. An ellipse is defined as the locus of points where the sum of distances to two fixed points (foci) is constant.\n2. An ellipse is defined analytically as a circle that has been scaled in one direction, represented by the equation x² + (y/b)² = 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove these two definitions are equivalent, i.e., they describe the same set of curves.\n\nWait, the example had specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are the two definitions. Each definition is a separate assumption. So I should list each definition as a separate line under assumptions.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that the two definitions of an ellipse (locus with constant sum of distances to two foci and the squashed circle equation) are equivalent.\n\nI need to make sure the problem is phrased clearly, and the assumptions are correctly broken down. Let me check again. The original question mentions classical definition (sum of distances) and the analytical equation. The user wants to show these yield the same family of shapes. Therefore, the problem is to prove the equivalence between these two definitions. The assumptions are each of the definitions. Each definition is an assumption about the ellipse's properties. So yes, two assumptions here.\n\nI don't see any other conditions or objects involved. The key is that each definition is an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem to prove equivalence.",
