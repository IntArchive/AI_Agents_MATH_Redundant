    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The question is about eigenvalues of a matrix and its square. So, we need to show that if λ is an eigenvalue of A², then either sqrt(λ) or -sqrt(λ) is an eigenvalue of A. \n\nFirst, let's recall some basic concepts about eigenvalues. If λ is an eigenvalue of A², that means there exists a non-zero vector α such that A²α = λα. The goal is to find a vector β and a scalar μ such that Aβ = μβ, where μ is either sqrt(λ) or -sqrt(λ). \n\nHmm, maybe I can start by manipulating the equation A²α = λα. Let's see. If I factor A² - λI, that would be (A - sqrt(λ)I)(A + sqrt(λ)I)α = 0. Wait, but does that help? If I expand (A - sqrt(λ)I)(A + sqrt(λ)I)α, I get A²α - λIα, which is indeed zero because A²α = λα. So, that's correct. \n\nBut how does that help us find an eigenvector for A? Let's think. The product of two matrices (A - sqrt(λ)I) and (A + sqrt(λ)I) applied to α gives zero. This suggests that either (A - sqrt(λ)I)α = 0, which would mean α is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue sqrt(λ), or (A + sqrt(λ)I)β = 0 for some β, which would give eigenvalue -sqrt(λ). But wait, maybe α is not necessarily in the kernel of either (A - sqrt(λ)I) or (A + sqrt(λ)I), but their composition annihilates α. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that if (A - sqrt(λ)I)(A + sqrt(λ)I)α = 0, then either (A + sqrt(λ)I)α is in the kernel of (A - sqrt(λ)I), or α is in the kernel of (A + sqrt(λ)I). If (A + sqrt(λ)I)α ≠ 0, then it must be an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue sqrt(λ). Similarly, if (A - sqrt(λ)I)α ≠ 0, then perhaps (A - sqrt(λ)I)α is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -sqrt(λ). Wait, maybe I need to check that.\n\nLet me try setting β = (A + sqrt(λ)I)α. Then, applying (A - sqrt(λ)I) to β gives (A - sqrt(λ)I)(A + sqrt(λ)I)α = 0, which is given. So, (A - sqrt(λ)I)β = 0. Therefore, if β ≠ 0, then β is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue sqrt(λ). If β = 0, then (A + sqrt(λ)I)α = 0, which would mean α is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue -sqrt(λ). \n\nAh, that seems to work. So, either β is non-zero and gives the eigenvalue sqrt(λ), or β is zero and α itself is the eigenvector for -sqrt(λ). Therefore, either sqrt(λ) or -sqrt(λ) must be an eigenvalue of A. \n\nWait, but this relies on the fact that α is non-zero. Since α is an eigenvector for A², it's non-zero. So, either β is non-zero or it's zero. If β is non-zero, then we have the eigenvalue sqrt(λ). If β is zero, then we have -sqrt(λ). Therefore, that's the conclusion. \n\nBut let me make sure there are no gaps here. Suppose that both (A + sqrt(λ)I)α and (A - sqrt(λ)I)α are zero. Is that possible? If both are zero, then adding them gives 2Aα = 0, so Aα = 0, but then A²α = 0, which would imply λ = 0, and then sqrt(λ) = 0, so 0 would be the eigenvalue. But in that case, if Aα = 0, then α is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0, which is sqrt(λ). But maybe this is a special case when λ = 0. \n\nAnother way to think is using the minimal polynomial or characteristic polynomial. Since we are working over complex numbers, the matrix A is triangularizable. So, we can consider A in upper triangular form. Then the eigenvalues of A² are the squares of the eigenvalues of A. Therefore, if μ is an eigenvalue of A, then μ² is an eigenvalue of A². Thus, if λ is an eigenvalue of A², then λ = μ² for some eigenvalue μ of A, hence μ is either sqrt(λ) or -sqrt(λ). \n\nBut the problem states to prove it without necessarily using Jordan canonical form or triangularization, perhaps using more basic properties. \n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if p(x) is a polynomial such that p(A) = 0, then every eigenvalue of A is a root of p. But here, we can consider the polynomial x² - λ. Since A²α = λα, then (A² - λI)α = 0, so α is in the null space of A² - λI. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of A divides x² - λ, so eigenvalues of A must satisfy x² - λ = 0, hence x = sqrt(λ) or x = -sqrt(λ). \n\nWait, but the minimal polynomial might not split into linear factors unless we are working over an algebraically closed field like the complex numbers. Since the problem states that A is a matrix of complex numbers, we can indeed factor polynomials completely. So, the eigenvalues of A must be roots of x² - λ, hence sqrt(λ) or -sqrt(λ). \n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows. \n\nBut perhaps the original approach with constructing β is more elementary. Let me verify that again. \n\nGiven that A²α = λα, α ≠ 0. \n\nDefine β = (A + sqrt(λ)I)α. Then compute Aβ:\n\nAβ = A(A + sqrt(λ)I)α = A²α + sqrt(λ)Aα = λα + sqrt(λ)Aα. \n\nBut we want to see if this equals sqrt(λ)β. Let's check:\n\nsqrt(λ)β = sqrt(λ)(A + sqrt(λ)I)α = sqrt(λ)Aα + λ α. \n\nComparing with Aβ: Aβ = λ α + sqrt(λ) Aα. \n\nSo yes, Aβ = sqrt(λ)β. \n\nTherefore, if β ≠ 0, then β is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue sqrt(λ). \n\nIf β = 0, then (A + sqrt(λ)I)α = 0, so Aα = -sqrt(λ)α, which means α is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -sqrt(λ). \n\nSince α ≠ 0, either β is non-zero (giving sqrt(λ) eigenvalue) or β is zero (giving -sqrt(λ) eigenvalue). Therefore, at least one of them must hold, hence the result. \n\nThis seems solid. The key idea is constructing β from α and A, then showing that either β is an eigenvector for sqrt(λ), or α itself is an eigenvector for -sqrt(λ). \n\nAnother angle: using the fact that eigenvalues of A² are squares of eigenvalues of A. Since we're over complex numbers, all eigenvalues exist. Thus, if λ is an eigenvalue of A², then λ = μ² for some eigenvalue μ of A, so μ = ±sqrt(λ). \n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a more direct proof, especially since it's presented in the question as trying to find β such that Aβ = sqrt(λ)β given A²α = λα. \n\nIn any case, the answer would involve either the polynomial argument or constructing β as above. \n\nTo structure the problem as per the user's format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is an n×n matrix of complex numbers.\n- λ is an eigenvalue of A².\n- There exists a non-zero vector α such that A²α = λα.\n\nProblem:\nProve that either √λ or -√λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n\nWait, but the original problem mentions \"If λ is an eigenvalue of A², then either √λ or -√λ is an eigenvalue of A\". So the key assumptions are that A is a complex matrix (to ensure eigenvalues exist and roots are taken in complex numbers), and λ is an eigenvalue of A². The problem is to show the conclusion about eigenvalues of A.\n\nThe user's example extracted assumptions line by line, each applying to one object. So here:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×n matrix,\nA has complex number entries,\nλ is an eigenvalue of A².\n\nProblem:\nProve that either √λ or -√λ is an eigenvalue of A.\n\nYes, each assumption is a single property. The problem is to show the existence of the eigenvalue.",
