    "Content": "I'm reading \"Contemporary Abstract Algebra,\" by Gallian . This is Exercise 4.30. Suppose $a$ and $b$ belong to a group, $a$ has odd order, and $aba^{-1}=b^{-1}$ . Show that $b^2=e$ . My Attempt: Let $\\lvert a\\rvert=2n+1$ , $n\\in\\Bbb N\\cup\\{0\\}$ . We have $$\\begin{align}\nb&=(b^{-1})^{-1} \\\\\n&=(aba^{-1})^{-1} \\\\\n&=ab^{-1}a^{-1},\n\\end{align}$$ so, by induction, $b=a(\\underbrace{aba^{-1}}_{=b^{-1}})a^{-1}=\\dots =a^{2n}ba^{-2n}$ , so that $$\\begin{align}\nb&=a^{2n}ba^{-2n} \\\\\n&=a^{2n}(ab^{-1}a^{-1})a^{-2n} \\\\\n&=a^{2n+1}b^{-1}a^{-(2n+1)} \\\\\n&=b^{-1},\n\\end{align}$$ so $b=b^{-1}$ , i.e. , $b^2=e$ . $\\square$ Is the above proof okay? I think it is. However , I'd be interested to see how properties of Baumslag-Solitar groups could be used here, since $aba^{-1}=b^{-1}$ brings them to mind.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof is fine. Here is an alternative one using a bit more group theory. Let $G$ denote the subgroup generated by $a$ and $b$ . Let $H \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_n$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by $b$ . Since $aba^{-1}=b^{-1}$ , it follows that $H$ is normal $G$ . The quotient $G/H$ must be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ for some odd $m$ , since the image of $a$ under the map $G \\rightarrow G/H$ maps to a generator of $G/H$ and $a$ has odd order. The conjugation action of $a$ on $H$ hence gives rise to a homomorphism $$  \\mathbb{Z}_m \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Aut}(H): 1 \\mapsto \\varphi=( b \\mapsto aba^{-1}=b^{-1})      $$ Note that $\\varphi$ is either trivial or of order two. Since $m\\varphi =0$ for $m$ odd, it follows that $\\varphi$ is trivial. Hence $b=b^{-1}$ , i.e. $b^2=e$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully. The user is asking about a group theory problem from Gallian's book. The problem states: Suppose $a$ and $b$ belong to a group, $a$ has odd order, and $aba^{-1}=b^{-1}$. Show that $b^2=e$. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem. The group elements are $a$ and $b$. The first condition is that $a$ has odd order. The second condition is the relation $aba^{-1} = b^{-1}$. The conclusion to show is $b^2 = e$. \n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"belong to a group,\" so that's the overarching setting. So the assumptions would be: $a$ and $b$ are elements of a group $G$, the order of $a$ is odd, and the conjugation relation holds. Each of these should be separate lines. Let me check the example provided. In the example, assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So each assumption is a single condition.\n\nSo for this problem:\n\nAssumption 1: $a$ is an element of group $G$.\nAssumption 2: $b$ is an element of group $G$.\nAssumption 3: The order of $a$ is odd.\nAssumption 4: $aba^{-1} = b^{-1}$.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement already says \"Suppose $a$ and $b$ belong to a group,\" so maybe I can combine the first two into \"a and b are elements of a group.\" However, the example listed each object's condition separately. Wait, in the example, the first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer,\" and the second was \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Here, \"a and b belong to a group\" is a single condition, but in the example, they split the properties of n into separate lines. Maybe to follow the example, we need to split different conditions even if they apply to different objects. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line even if they apply to the same object. So for this problem, even though a and b are both elements of the group, perhaps each should be a separate assumption. Wait, but the problem states \"a and b belong to a group.\" That's a single condition. However, in the example, \"n is an integer\" is separate from \"n is divisible by 7.\" So perhaps here, we should have:\n\nAssumption 1: $a$ and $b$ belong to a group.\nAssumption 2: The order of $a$ is odd.\nAssumption 3: $aba^{-1} = b^{-1}$.\n\nBut wait, the example splits \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate assumptions. So each property is a separate line, even for the same object. So maybe here:\n\nAssumption 1: $a$ is an element of a group.\nAssumption 2: $b$ is an element of the same group.\nAssumption 3: The order of $a$ is odd.\nAssumption 4: $aba^{-1} = b^{-1}$.\n\nBut the original problem says \"a and b belong to a group,\" which is a single statement. But the example splits \"n is an integer\" and another condition on n. Maybe here, \"a and b belong to a group\" is one assumption, then the order of a is another, and the conjugation is the third. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Suppose $a$ and $b$ belong to a group, $a$ has odd order, and $aba^{-1}=b^{-1}$. Show that $b^2=e$.\" So the three conditions are:\n\n1. a and b are elements of a group.\n2. a has odd order.\n3. aba^{-1} = b^{-1}.\n\nTherefore, following the example's structure, each condition is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption 1: $a$ and $b$ belong to a group.\nAssumption 2: The order of $a$ is odd.\nAssumption 3: $aba^{-1} = b^{-1}$.\n\nBut the example splits the conditions on the same object into separate lines, like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So here, \"a and b belong to a group\" is one condition, then \"order of a is odd\" is another, and \"aba^{-1}=b^{-1}\" is the third. Therefore, three assumptions. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the user's example had two assumptions for n. Here, we have three. But the key is each assumption is a separate condition, even if they apply to different objects. So the answer should be:\n\nAssumption: \n$a$ and $b$ are elements of a group,\nThe order of $a$ is odd,\n$aba^{-1} = b^{-1}$.\nProblem: Show that $b^2 = e$.\n\nYes, that's three assumptions. Each is a separate condition. The first is group membership, the second is the order of a, and the third is the conjugation relation. That seems correct. The problem is to show $b^2 = e$.\n\nI should check if there are any hidden assumptions. The problem as stated doesn't mention anything else. The user's own attempt uses the given conditions and manipulates them. So the assumptions are correctly captured. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as above.",
