    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about group theory. We have a group G, and two elements a and b in G. The orders of a and b are m and n respectively, and they commute, meaning ab = ba. We need to prove there's an element c in G whose order is exactly the least common multiple (lcm) of m and n, which is A = lcm(m,n). \n\nFirst, the user mentioned considering (ab)^A. Since a and b commute, we can write (ab)^A as a^A * b^A. Since the order of a is m, a^m = 1, so a^A would be a^(m*(A/m)) = (a^m)^(A/m) = 1^(A/m) = 1. Similarly, since the order of b is n, b^A = b^(n*(A/n)) = (b^n)^(A/n) = 1^(A/n) = 1. Therefore, (ab)^A = 1*1 = 1. This shows that the order of ab divides A. But the problem is that the order of ab might not be exactly A; it could be a divisor of A. So we need to find another element c whose order is exactly A.\n\nHmm, maybe instead of taking ab directly, we need to take a different combination of a and b. I recall that in abelian groups, if the orders of a and b are coprime, then the order of ab is the product of the orders, which is the lcm since they are coprime. But here, m and n might not be coprime. So maybe we need to decompose m and n into their prime factors and construct an element that has the maximum exponents for each prime.\n\nWait, but the group isn't necessarily abelian, only that a and b commute. So the subgroup generated by a and b is abelian because they commute. So maybe within that subgroup, we can find such an element. \n\nLet me think about the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, consider the prime factors of m and n. Let’s write m = product of primes p_i^k_i and n = product of primes p_j^l_j. The lcm of m and n would be the product of primes with the maximum exponents from m and n. So maybe we can construct an element c by taking parts of a and b such that the exponents for each prime in the order of c are the max from m and n.\n\nFor example, suppose m = p^a and n = p^b. Then the lcm is p^max(a,b). If a and b are elements of order p^a and p^b, then if we take c = a if a >= b, or c = b otherwise, then the order of c is p^max(a,b). But this is only when they have the same prime. If they have different primes, then the lcm is the product. \n\nBut in general, for m and n with arbitrary prime factors, perhaps we can take the product of the parts of a and b corresponding to each prime's maximum exponent. So, if m = product p_i^{k_i} and n = product p_i^{l_i}, then for each prime p_i, take the part of a or b that has the higher exponent. \n\nBut how do we decompose a and b into such components? In an abelian group, we can express elements as products of elements with prime power orders, but in a non-abelian group, even if a and b commute, their subgroup is abelian, so maybe we can use the structure theorem for abelian groups here.\n\nAlternatively, consider taking c = a^k * b^l for some exponents k and l. Then, we need to choose k and l such that the order of c is lcm(m,n). Let's see. Suppose we set k = m / gcd(m,n) and l = n / gcd(m,n). Then, since m and n divided by their gcd are coprime. Then, the order of a^k would be gcd(m,n), and the order of b^l would be gcd(m,n). Wait, no. Wait, the order of a^k is m / gcd(m,k). If k = m / d, where d = gcd(m,n), then the order of a^k would be d. Similarly, the order of b^l where l = n / d would also be d. Then, since a^k and b^l commute, their product would have order lcm(d, d) = d. That doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take c = a^s * b^t where s and t are chosen such that the exponents in s and t are such that when multiplied, they give the lcm. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of m and n as numbers. Let A = lcm(m,n) = m*n / gcd(m,n). So if we can find integers s and t such that s divides m, t divides n, and s and t are coprime, then lcm(s,t) = s*t. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a theorem: In an abelian group, the set of orders of elements is closed under taking least common multiples. That is, if there are elements of orders m and n, then there is an element of order lcm(m,n). Since here, a and b commute, the subgroup they generate is abelian, so we can apply that theorem. But how to construct such an element explicitly?\n\nAnother approach: Write A = lcm(m,n) = m' * n' where m' divides m, n' divides n, and m' and n' are coprime. Then, since m' divides m, a^{m/m'} has order m', and similarly b^{n/n'} has order n'. Then, since m' and n' are coprime, the product of these two elements would have order m' * n' = lcm(m,n). Let me check this.\n\nLet’s denote m = m' * k and n = n' * l, where m' and n' are coprime, and k = gcd(m,n). Wait, perhaps I should use the formula lcm(m,n) = (m * n) / gcd(m,n). Let me instead factor m and n into their prime components. For each prime p, let the exponent in m be e_p and in n be f_p. Then, the exponent in lcm(m,n) is max(e_p, f_p) for each p. So, to construct an element with order lcm(m,n), we need for each prime p, to have the exponent in its order be max(e_p, f_p). \n\nTo do this, we can take for each prime p, if e_p >= f_p, take the component from a, otherwise from b. But how to do this in the group? Since a and b commute, perhaps we can write c as a product of powers of a and b such that for each prime, the exponent in the order of c is max(e_p, f_p). \n\nFor example, suppose m = 12 = 2^2 * 3^1 and n = 18 = 2^1 * 3^2. Then lcm(12,18) = 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. So we need an element with order 36. To get this, we can take a^{3} which has order 4 (since 12 / 3 = 4) and b^{2} which has order 9 (since 18 / 2 = 9). Then, since 4 and 9 are coprime, the product a^3 * b^2 would have order 4*9=36. \n\nYes, this seems to work. So in general, factor m and n into their prime factors. For each prime p in m or n, let e_p be the exponent in m and f_p be the exponent in n. For each prime p, define d_p = max(e_p, f_p). Then, for each prime p in m, if e_p < d_p, we need to take a power of a to get an element with exponent e_p adjusted to d_p. Wait, perhaps not. Wait, let's think differently. \n\nGiven that the order of a is m and order of b is n, we can write m = product_{p|m} p^{e_p} and n = product_{p|n} p^{f_p}. Then, lcm(m,n) = product_{p|m or p|n} p^{max(e_p,f_p)}. \n\nTo construct an element of order lcm(m,n), we can take, for each prime p in lcm(m,n), the component from either a or b whichever has the higher exponent. To do this, let's decompose a and b into their p-primary components. But since the group may not be abelian, but a and b commute, the subgroup generated by a and b is abelian, so we can treat them as elements of an abelian group. In an abelian group, every element can be written as the product of elements with prime power orders, and the order of the product is the lcm of the orders. \n\nWait, but in this case, a and b are two elements that commute. So their subgroup is abelian. Therefore, we can use the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, which tells us that in an abelian group, the order of the product of two elements is the lcm of their orders if they are coprime. If not, it's more complicated. But perhaps we can split a and b into parts with coprime orders.\n\nLet’s take m and n, and let d = gcd(m,n). Then, we can write m = d * m', n = d * n', where gcd(m',n')=1. Then, lcm(m,n) = d * m' * n'. Now, since a has order m = d * m', the element a^{d} has order m', and similarly, b^{d} has order n'. But wait, no. The order of a^{d} is m / gcd(d, m). Since m = d * m', so gcd(d, m) = gcd(d, d*m') = d * gcd(1, m') = d. Therefore, the order of a^{d} is (d*m') / d = m'. Similarly, the order of b^{d} is n'. Now, since m' and n' are coprime, the elements a^{d} and b^{d} commute, so their product has order m' * n'. Then, multiplying by an element of order d, maybe? Wait, perhaps take c = a^{k} * b^{l} where k and l are chosen such that the orders are coprime.\n\nAlternatively, take c = a^{n'} * b^{m'}, where m' = m / gcd(m,n) and n' = n / gcd(m,n). Then, since m' and n' are coprime, the order of a^{n'} is m / gcd(m, n') = m / gcd(d*m', n') = since n' is n / d = (d*n') / d = n' ? Wait, maybe not. Let me check. \n\nIf m = d * m', n = d * n', gcd(m',n')=1. Then, the order of a^{n'} is m / gcd(m, n') = d*m' / gcd(d*m', n'). Since gcd(d*m', n') = gcd(d, n') * gcd(m', n') = gcd(d, n') * 1 = gcd(d, n'). But since n' is part of n, and d = gcd(m,n), so n' and d are coprime. Because n = d * n', and d is the gcd, so gcd(d, n')=1. Therefore, gcd(d*m', n') = 1. Therefore, the order of a^{n'} is d*m' / 1 = d*m' = m. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no: if we take a^{n'}, then since the order of a is m = d*m', the order of a^{n'} is m / gcd(n', m). But gcd(n', m) = gcd(n', d*m') = gcd(n', d) * gcd(n', m') = 1 * 1 = 1, since n' and d are coprime (as n' comes from n/d where d is the gcd), and n' and m' are coprime by construction. Therefore, the order of a^{n'} is m / 1 = m. That's not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me go back. Since the subgroup generated by a and b is abelian, and in abelian groups, there exists an element of order lcm(m,n). The standard proof is to decompose the group into primary components and take the product of elements with the highest powers for each prime. \n\nAlternatively, since in an abelian group, if you have two elements with orders m and n, then there exists an element of order lcm(m,n). The proof involves breaking down the elements into their primary components and constructing such an element. \n\nGiven that a and b generate an abelian subgroup, we can apply this theorem. Therefore, the element c exists in that subgroup, hence in G. \n\nBut the problem asks to prove it, not just cite the theorem. So the user is probably expected to construct such an element. \n\nLet’s consider the example where m and n are powers of different primes. Say m = p^a, n = q^b, with p ≠ q. Then lcm(m,n) = m*n. Since a and b commute, the order of ab is lcm(m,n), because the orders are coprime. So in this case, c = ab works. \n\nIf m and n are powers of the same prime, say p^a and p^b. Then lcm(m,n) = p^max(a,b). So we need an element of order p^max(a,b). If a >= b, then a already has order p^a, so c = a. Similarly, if b > a, c = b. \n\nBut in the general case where m and n have multiple primes, some overlapping, some not, we need to combine these. For each prime in the factorization of lcm(m,n), we take the higher exponent from either m or n. \n\nTo construct c, we can write c as the product of elements, each of which handles one prime. For primes where m has the higher exponent, take the corresponding part from a, and for primes where n has the higher exponent, take the corresponding part from b. \n\nBut how to formally do this? Since the group is abelian, we can decompose a and b into their primary components. For example, if m = p^a * q^b and n = p^c * r^d, then the lcm is p^max(a,c) * q^b * r^d. To get this, we take from a the q^b component, from b the r^d component, and from either a or b the p^max(a,c) component. \n\nBut since a and b commute, we can take a^{k} * b^{l} where k and l are chosen such that for each prime, the exponent in the order of a^{k} is the max exponent from m and n. \n\nAlternatively, consider writing m = m1 * m2 and n = n1 * n2 where m1 and n1 are the parts of m and n with primes where m has higher or equal exponents, and n2 and m2 are the parts where n has higher exponents. Then, take the product of the m1 part from a and the n2 part from b. \n\nThis is getting a bit abstract. Maybe a better way is to use the formula c = a^{t} * b^{s}, where t and s are chosen such that the order of c is lcm(m,n). \n\nLet me try setting t = m / gcd(m,n) and s = n / gcd(m,n). Then, since t and s are coprime (because m = gcd(m,n)*t and n = gcd(m,n)*s, and gcd(t,s)=1). Then, the order of a^{t} is m / gcd(m,t) = m / t (since t divides m). Wait, m = gcd(m,n)*t, so t = m / gcd(m,n). Therefore, gcd(m,t) = gcd(gcd(m,n)*t, t) = t * gcd(gcd(m,n),1) = t * 1 = t. Wait, that can't be. Wait, m = gcd(m,n) * t. So t = m / gcd(m,n). Therefore, gcd(m,t) = gcd(gcd(m,n)*t, t) = t * gcd(gcd(m,n),1) = t. Since gcd(m,n) and t are coprime? Wait, no. Wait, m = gcd(m,n)*t, so t = m / gcd(m,n). Then, gcd(t, gcd(m,n)) = gcd(m / gcd(m,n), gcd(m,n)) = 1. Because any common divisor of m / gcd(m,n) and gcd(m,n) must divide m and gcd(m,n), but since m / gcd(m,n) and gcd(m,n) are coprime, their gcd is 1. \n\nTherefore, the order of a^{t} is m / gcd(m,t) = m / t = gcd(m,n). Similarly, the order of b^{s} is n / gcd(n,s) = n / s = gcd(m,n). Therefore, both a^{t} and b^{s} have order gcd(m,n). But since t and s are coprime, the product a^{t} * b^{s} has order gcd(m,n) * gcd(m,n)? No, wait, if two commuting elements have order k and are coprime, then the order of their product is lcm(k,k) = k. But here, the orders are both gcd(m,n), and they are not necessarily coprime. So their product would have order dividing gcd(m,n). That's not helpful. \n\nHmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me think differently. Suppose we set c = a^{s} * b^{t} where s and t are such that s divides m, t divides n, and gcd(s,t) = 1. Then, the order of c would be lcm(m/s, n/t). We need to choose s and t such that lcm(m/s, n/t) = lcm(m,n). \n\nLet me set m/s = lcm(m,n) / k and n/t = lcm(m,n) / l, such that k and l are divisors of lcm(m,n). But this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, recall that in an abelian group, if x has order a and y has order b, then the order of xy divides lcm(a,b). To have equality, we need that the orders of x and y are coprime. So if we can split the lcm(m,n) into two coprime factors, one dividing m and the other dividing n, then the product would have order equal to the product of those factors, which is the lcm. \n\nLet’s write A = lcm(m,n) = m' * n' where m' divides m, n' divides n, and gcd(m',n')=1. Then, since m' divides m, there exists an element x in <a> of order m', and similarly an element y in <b> of order n'. Then, since x and y commute and their orders are coprime, the order of xy is m' * n' = A. \n\nBut how to find such m' and n'? Well, since A = lcm(m,n), we can write A = (m * n) / gcd(m,n). Let’s set m' = m / gcd(m,n) and n' = n. Then gcd(m',n') = gcd(m / gcd(m,n), n). But since m' = m / gcd(m,n) and gcd(m', gcd(m,n)) = 1 (because we divided out the gcd), and n = gcd(m,n) * (n / gcd(m,n)), so gcd(m',n) = gcd(m', gcd(m,n) * (n / gcd(m,n))) = gcd(m', gcd(m,n)) * gcd(m', n / gcd(m,n)) = 1 * gcd(m', n / gcd(m,n))). But m' and n / gcd(m,n) are coprime because m' = m / gcd(m,n) and n / gcd(m,n) are parts of m and n after removing the gcd, so they are coprime. Therefore, gcd(m',n) = 1. Wait, no. Let me clarify. \n\nLet’s denote d = gcd(m,n). Then, m = d * m', n = d * n', where gcd(m',n')=1. Then, A = lcm(m,n) = d * m' * n'. So to write A as a product of two coprime numbers, we can take m' * d and n', but gcd(m'*d, n')=1 because gcd(m',n')=1 and gcd(d,n')=1 (since d = gcd(m,n) = gcd(d*m', d*n') = d * gcd(m',n') = d*1 = d, so gcd(d,n')=1). Therefore, m'*d and n' are coprime. Therefore, if we take x in <a> of order m'*d and y in <b> of order n', then since x and y commute and their orders are coprime, the order of xy is m'*d * n' = A. \n\nWait, but m'*d is m. Because m = d*m', so x would just be a itself, which has order m. Similarly, y would be b^{d}, since the order of b^{d} is n / gcd(d,n) = n / d = n'. Then, the order of a * b^{d} would be lcm(m, n') = m * n' since m and n' are coprime (because m = d*m', and n' is coprime to m'). But d and n' are coprime, so m = d*m' and n' are coprime. Therefore, lcm(m, n') = m * n' = d*m'*n' = A. \n\nYes! So here's the construction. Let d = gcd(m,n). Then, since a has order m and b has order n, the element b^{d} has order n / d = n'. Since m and n' are coprime (because m = d*m' and n = d*n', gcd(m',n')=1, so m = d*m' and n' are coprime), then the elements a and b^{d} commute and have coprime orders m and n'. Therefore, their product a * b^{d} has order m * n' = d*m'*n' = lcm(m,n). \n\nTherefore, c = a * b^{d} is the desired element. \n\nLet me verify this with an example. Suppose m = 6, n = 4. Then d = gcd(6,4) = 2. So n' = n / d = 4 / 2 = 2. The element b^{2} has order 2. Then, a has order 6, which is coprime to 2. Therefore, the order of a * b^{2} is 6 * 2 = 12, which is indeed lcm(6,4) = 12. \n\nAnother example: m = 12, n = 18. Then d = gcd(12,18) = 6. n' = 18 / 6 = 3. b^{6} has order 3. a has order 12, which is coprime to 3. So the order of a * b^{6} is 12 * 3 = 36, which is lcm(12,18)=36. \n\nThis seems to work. So the general construction is: Let d = gcd(m,n). Then c = a * b^{d}. Since the order of b^{d} is n/d, and gcd(m, n/d) = gcd(m, n)/d = d/d = 1, wait, no. Wait, m and n/d might not be coprime. Wait, in the previous example, m = 6, d = 2, n/d = 4/2 = 2. Then gcd(6, 2) = 2, not 1. Wait, but in the first example, m = 6 and n' = 2, but we said they were coprime. That contradicts. Wait, no. Wait, in the first example, m = 6 and n' = 2. gcd(6,2)=2, not 1. But earlier I thought they were coprime. Hmm, there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, let's re-examine the construction. If d = gcd(m,n), then n = d * n', and m = d * m', where gcd(m',n')=1. Therefore, m and n' are d*m' and n', and since gcd(m',n')=1, but m = d*m', so gcd(m, n') = gcd(d*m', n') = gcd(d, n') * gcd(m',n') = gcd(d, n') * 1 = gcd(d, n'). \n\nBut since d = gcd(m,n), and n = d * n', then gcd(d, n') must be 1. Because n' = n / d, and since d is the gcd of m and n, any common divisor of d and n' would divide both m and n, but since d is the greatest common divisor, such a divisor must be 1. Therefore, gcd(d, n')=1. \n\nTherefore, gcd(m, n') = gcd(d*m', n') = gcd(d, n') * gcd(m',n') = 1 * 1 = 1. Therefore, m and n' are coprime. \n\nAh, so in the example where m=6, n=4: d = gcd(6,4)=2, n'=4/2=2. Then m=6=d*m' → m'=3. Then gcd(m',n')=gcd(3,2)=1. And gcd(d, n')=gcd(2,2)=2, which contradicts the earlier conclusion. Wait, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, no. If m = d*m' = 2*3, n = d*n' = 2*2. Then n'=2. Then gcd(d, n')=gcd(2,2)=2, which is not 1. So my previous conclusion that gcd(d, n')=1 is incorrect. Therefore, the assertion that gcd(m, n')=1 is also incorrect. \n\nThis means there's a flaw in the previous reasoning. Let me re-examine. \n\nGiven m and n, d = gcd(m,n). Write m = d*m', n = d*n', where gcd(m',n')=1. Then, gcd(m, n') = gcd(d*m', n'). Since n' = n/d, and n = d*n', so gcd(d*m', n') = gcd(d*m', n'). Since gcd(m',n')=1, this is gcd(d, n'). \n\nBut since d = gcd(m,n), and n = d*n', then any common divisor of d and n' would divide both m and n. But since d is the greatest common divisor, such a divisor must divide d. However, if there's a common divisor k >1 of d and n', then k divides d and n', hence k divides m = d*m' and n = d*n', so k divides gcd(m,n) = d. But since k divides d and k divides n', which is coprime with m', we have k divides d and n', but since m' and n' are coprime, and d divides m (as m = d*m'), then gcd(d, n') must divide gcd(m, n') which is part of the original gcd. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's take the example m=6, n=4. Then d=2, m'=3, n'=2. gcd(d, n')=gcd(2,2)=2. So gcd(m, n')=gcd(6,2)=2, which is not 1. So in this case, m and n' are not coprime. But earlier, we thought that a * b^{d} would have order m * n', but in this case, a has order 6, b^{2} has order 2. Then a*b^{2} would have order lcm(6,2)=6, not 12. Wait, but in the example earlier, I thought it worked, but apparently it doesn't. \n\nWait, let's take specific elements. Suppose G is the additive group Z/6Z × Z/4Z. Let a = (1,0) which has order 6, b = (0,1) which has order 4. They commute. Then d = gcd(6,4)=2. b^{2} = (0,2) which has order 2. Then a + b^{2} = (1,2). What's the order of (1,2) in Z/6Z × Z/4Z? The order is the least common multiple of the orders of 1 in Z/6Z and 2 in Z/4Z. The order of 1 in Z/6Z is 6, the order of 2 in Z/4Z is 2 (since 2*2=4≡0). Therefore, the order of (1,2) is lcm(6,2)=6. But lcm(6,4)=12. So this construction does not give an element of order 12. Therefore, my previous reasoning was flawed. \n\nSo what's wrong here? The problem is that even though m' and n' are coprime, m and n' may not be. In the example, m=6, n'=2, which have gcd=2. Therefore, the orders are not coprime, so the product does not have order m*n'. \n\nTherefore, the earlier approach is incorrect. \n\nThis means I need to rethink the construction. \n\nAnother method: Since the subgroup generated by a and b is abelian, and in abelian groups, the existence of an element with order equal to the lcm of two elements' orders is guaranteed. The standard way to prove this is by decomposing the group into its primary components. \n\nFor each prime p dividing A = lcm(m,n), we can find an element in <a,b> whose p-component has exponent equal to the maximum exponent in m and n. Then, the product of these elements over all primes will have order A. \n\nTo do this explicitly, for each prime p dividing A, we can take either a^{m/p^{e_p}}} or b^{n/p^{f_p}}} where e_p is the exponent of p in m and f_p is the exponent in n, whichever is higher. \n\nWait, let's take an example. Let m=6=2^1*3^1, n=4=2^2. Then A=lcm(6,4)=12=2^2*3^1. For prime 2, the maximum exponent is 2 (from n). For prime 3, it's 1 (from m). \n\nTo get an element with order 12, we need an element with 2^2 and 3^1 in its order. \n\nIn the group Z/6Z × Z/4Z, the element (3,1) has order 12. Because 3 in Z/6Z has order 2, 1 in Z/4Z has order 4. Wait, no, (3,1) would have order lcm(2,4)=4. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, (2,1): order lcm(3,4)=12. Because 2 in Z/6Z has order 3, 1 in Z/4Z has order 4. So (2,1) has order 12. \n\nBut how to construct this element from a and b? If a = (1,0) and b=(0,1), then 2a + 1b = (2,1). So c= a^2 * b^1. The order of a^2 is 6/gcd(2,6)=3, order of b^1 is 4. Since 3 and 4 are coprime, the order of a^2 * b is 3*4=12. \n\nAh! So here's the correct approach. Factor A = lcm(m,n) into primes. For each prime p in A, determine whether the exponent comes from m or n. Then, for each such prime, take the corresponding power of a or b to get an element whose order has that exponent. Then, multiply these elements together. Since the primes are different, the orders are coprime, and the product will have order equal to the product of the primes' exponents, which is A. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nLet’s define for each prime p dividing A, set k_p = exponent of p in m, l_p = exponent of p in n. If k_p >= l_p, let x_p = a^{m / p^{k_p}}, which has order p^{k_p}. If l_p > k_p, let x_p = b^{n / p^{l_p}}, which has order p^{l_p}. Then, the product of all x_p will have order equal to the product of p^{max(k_p, l_p)}, which is A. \n\nIn the example m=6, n=4: primes 2 and 3. For p=2: k_p=1, l_p=2. So take x_2 = b^{4 / 2^2} = b^{1}, which has order 4. For p=3: k_p=1, l_p=0. Take x_3 = a^{6 / 3^1} = a^{2}, which has order 3. Then x_2 * x_3 = b * a^{2}, which has order 4*3=12. \n\nYes, this works. Similarly, in the previous example where m=12 and n=18, lcm=36. For prime 2: exponent in m=2, in n=1. Take x_2 = a^{12/2^2} = a^{3}, order 4. For prime 3: exponent in m=1, in n=2. Take x_3 = b^{18/3^2}=b^{2}, order 9. Then x_2 * x_3 has order 4*9=36. \n\nTherefore, the general construction is: For each prime p dividing lcm(m,n), if the exponent of p in m is greater than or equal to that in n, take a^{m / p^{k_p}} (which has order p^{k_p}), otherwise take b^{n / p^{l_p}} (which has order p^{l_p}). Then, the product of all these elements will have order equal to the product of p^{max(k_p,l_p)}}, which is lcm(m,n). \n\nTherefore, the element c can be constructed as the product of such components. Since the group is abelian (as a and b commute), the order of the product is the product of the orders, which are pairwise coprime (since each component is a prime power from distinct primes). \n\nThus, the answer is to construct c as the product over all primes dividing lcm(m,n) of either a^{m/p^{k_p}} or b^{n/p^{l_p}}, whichever has the higher exponent for that prime. This element c will have order lcm(m,n).",
