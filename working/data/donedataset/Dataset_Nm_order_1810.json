    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from the user. The task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem and extract the assumptions and the core problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that a finite field cannot be an ordered field. The user mentions Rudin's statement that all ordered fields with the supremum property are isomorphic to ℝ. Since finite fields can't be isomorphic to ℝ, the conclusion is that finite ordered fields don't exist. The user is asking for a proof of this.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list each assumption line by line, making sure each addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, identify the key elements in the problem. The main objects here are a finite field and the concept of an ordered field. The assumptions would be that the field is finite and that it is ordered. However, the original problem might have implicit assumptions based on the properties of ordered fields and finite fields.\n\nWait, the problem is to show that a finite field cannot be an ordered field. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The field is finite.\n2. The field is ordered (i.e., it has a total order compatible with field operations).\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such a field doesn't exist. Therefore, the problem statement is to show that a finite field cannot be an ordered field.\n\nWait, the original question says, \"A finite field cannot be an ordered field.\" So the user wants a proof of this statement. The assumptions would be the properties of a finite field and the properties of an ordered field. Let me think.\n\nIn the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more about the properties of the field. So the assumptions need to list the conditions that the field is finite and that it is ordered. However, in the problem statement, we need to state the goal: prove that a finite field cannot be an ordered field.\n\nBut the user's original question might have some extra context. Let me re-read the original question:\n\n\"I am reading baby Rudin and it says all ordered fields with supremum property are isomorphic to ℝ. Since all ordered finite fields would have supremum property that must mean none exist. Could someone please show me a proof of this?\"\n\nSo the user's reasoning is that if a finite ordered field existed, it would have the supremum property (since it's finite), and by Rudin's theorem, it would be isomorphic to ℝ, which is impossible because ℝ is infinite. Therefore, the user is asking for a direct proof that no finite field can be ordered.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions. The key assumptions here are that the field is finite and that it is ordered. The problem is to show that these two properties cannot hold simultaneously.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That might have been a mistake in the example, but the user provided that as an example, so perhaps they intended to extract specific conditions. Hmm, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants us to follow their format.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption in the formatted problem should not add that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made an error in their example. But regardless, we need to follow the instructions given.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, there was a miscommunication. Alternatively, maybe the original problem in the example had a typo or the user intended to modify it. However, according to the user's instruction, when structuring the problem, we need to filter the unrelated information and list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to prove that a finite field cannot be an ordered field. The key assumptions here are that the field is finite and that it is ordered. The problem is to prove that such a field cannot exist. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe field is finite,\nThe field is ordered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a finite field cannot be an ordered field.\n\nBut the user's original question mentions the supremum property. However, in the problem statement, the user wants to show that a finite field cannot be an ordered field, regardless of the supremum property. The reasoning in the question is that finite ordered fields would have the supremum property (because they're finite), hence isomorphic to ℝ, which is a contradiction. But the actual proof might not need to go through the supremum property. So perhaps the key assumptions are just that the field is finite and ordered, and the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to include the supremum property as an assumption, but the problem is structured as per the user's request. The user's thought process uses the supremum property, but the actual problem is to show that a finite field can't be ordered. So maybe the supremum property is part of the context but not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the title is \"A finite field cannot be an ordered field.\" So the task is to prove that statement. The user's reasoning mentions that since finite ordered fields would have the supremum property, leading to a contradiction. But perhaps the actual proof is more straightforward, using properties of ordered fields and finite fields.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe field is finite,\nThe field is ordered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a finite field cannot be an ordered field.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem needs to be phrased as \"Prove that there exists no finite ordered field\" or \"Show that a finite field cannot be an ordered field.\"\n\nBut the title is \"A finite field cannot be an ordered field,\" so the problem statement should reflect that.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have assumptions that the field is finite and ordered, and the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, i.e., such a field cannot exist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is simply to prove the title's assertion, and the assumptions are the properties required for a field to be ordered and finite.\n\nBut the user's example included specific assumptions about the objects in the problem. So in this case, the objects are the field, and the assumptions are that it's finite and ordered. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe field is finite,\nThe field is ordered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a finite field cannot be an ordered field.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. In ordered fields, certain properties must hold, like the sum of squares being non-negative, or that 1 is positive, etc. But maybe the key assumptions are just the finiteness and being ordered.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not need additional assumptions beyond the field being finite and ordered. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those two as assumptions.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe field is finite,\nThe field is ordered.\nProblem: \nProve that a finite field cannot be an ordered field.\n###",
