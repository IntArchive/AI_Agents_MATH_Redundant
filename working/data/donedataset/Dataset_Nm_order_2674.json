    "Content": "While working on this related inequality , I found the following inequality about right triangles. Let $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ be the two perpendicular sides of a right triangle then, $$\n1 \\le ab^{b^2/a^2} + ba^{a^2/b^2} < 1 + \\frac{7}{180}\n$$ I found this inequality interesting because it is pretty tight in the sense that the upper bound is less than $3.89\\%$ higher than the lower bound. Wolfram Alpha gives the upper bound as $1.03888$ and a Monte Carlo simulation gives $1.03888238314$ at $a = 0.18733386311638833$ and $b= 0.9822963013927571$ . Hence I have used $1+\\frac{7}{180} = 1.03888888...$ as an elegant estimate for the upper bound. Question : The above upper bound is using brute force methods of calculus, What is the best upper bound that can be obtained using Olympiad level tools and standard well known inequalities? Update 1 : The lower bound follows immediately from Young's inequality. Let $a^2+b^2 = c^2$ . Take $p = \\frac{c^2}{b^2}$ and $q = \\frac{c^2}{a^2}$ in $(3)$ of Young's inequality . Then, Young's inequality says that $$\n\\frac{b^2}{c^2}a^{c^2/b^2} + \\frac{a^2}{c^2}b^{c^2/a^2} \n= \\frac{b^2}{c^2}a^{1+a^2/b^2} + \\frac{a^2}{c^2}b^{1+b^2/a^2} \n= \\frac{b^2}{c^2}a^{1+a^2/b^2} + \\frac{a^2}{c^2}b^{1+b^2/a^2}\\ge ab\n$$ or equivalently, $\\displaystyle ab^{b^2/a^2} + ba^{a^2/b^2} \\ge c^2$ .\nScaling the right triangle to a unit circle, we have $a^2+b^2=c^2 =1$ and the lower bound follows.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $$f(a)=a \\left(1-a^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{a^2}-1\\right)}+a^{\\frac{a^2}{1-a^2}}\n   \\sqrt{1-a^2}$$ compute the derivative to see that you need to solve for $a$ $$g(a)=2\\,a^{\\frac{a^2}{1-a^2}+3} \\log\n   (a)-\\left(1-a^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 a^2}+1} \\log\n   \\left(1-a^2\\right)=0$$ Using Taylor series around $a=0$ gives $$g(a)=\\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{e}}+2 a^3 \\log (a)+O\\left(a^4\\right)$$ So $$2 a \\log (a)+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{e}}=0 \\quad \\implies \\quad a_0=\\exp\\left(W_{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{e}}\\right) \\right)$$ where appears Lambert function. Taking into account the neglected terms, we know that this is an underestimate of the solution. Numerically, this is $0.172660$ while the exact solution is $0.187334$ . Notice that $$f(a_0)=1.03875=1+\\frac {31}{800}=1+\\color{red}{\\frac{279}{280}}\\times \\frac 7 {180}$$ which is not bad  for a first shot.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, listing all assumptions line by line and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the title mentions a unit right triangle. So the main assumption here is that the triangle is a right triangle with legs a and b such that a² + b² = 1. The problem is about proving an inequality involving the expression ab^{b²/a²} + ba^{a²/b²}, specifically that it's between 1 and 1 + 7/180.\n\nThe user also mentioned that the lower bound comes from Young's inequality, but the upper bound was found using calculus and brute force. The question is asking for a better upper bound using Olympiad-level tools and standard inequalities.\n\nNow, to structure this according to the format. The assumptions should be each on their own line, addressing one property per line. The problem statement should be the inequality to prove.\n\nFirst assumption: The triangle is a right triangle. So, \"The triangle is a right triangle.\"\n\nSecond, since it's a unit right triangle, a² + b² = 1. So, \"a² + b² = 1, where a and b are the legs of the triangle.\"\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"unit right triangle\". Does that mean the hypotenuse is 1? Yes, because a² + b² = 1. So maybe the assumption is that the hypotenuse is 1. So perhaps \"The hypotenuse of the right triangle is 1.\" But the original problem states \"a unit right triangle\", which typically means the hypotenuse is 1. So the assumption should include that a² + b² = 1.\n\nBut in the example provided, assumptions are listed as individual conditions. So each assumption should be a single condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- a² + b² = 1, where a and b are the legs.\nBut wait, the problem might not need to list that a and b are legs; the equation a² + b² =1 implies it's a right triangle with hypotenuse 1. Wait, maybe the first assumption is redundant because if a² + b² =1, it's a right triangle. But the original problem states \"unit right triangle $a^2 + b^2 = 1$\". So perhaps the first assumption is that it's a unit right triangle, which inherently has a² + b² =1. But in the example given, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that as an assumption? Wait no, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is \"n is divisible by 7\" an assumption? That might be a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem states: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) - 6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\"\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. But perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrects it? Hmm, maybe the example is a bad example. But regardless, the user wants to structure the current problem.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The user needs to list all assumptions. The problem is about a unit right triangle, so the main assumption is that a² + b² =1 (unit hypotenuse), and the triangle is right-angled. However, in the problem statement, the user says \"in a unit right triangle\", so the assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is a right triangle with legs a and b.\n- a² + b² = 1.\n\nBut perhaps the first assumption is redundant because a² + b² =1 already implies it's a right triangle. However, maybe to be explicit, they list both. Alternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- The hypotenuse of the triangle is 1 (unit).\n\nBut the equation a² + b² =1 comes from that. So in the example given, the assumptions are listed as separate lines. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- a² + b² = 1, where a and b are the legs.\n\nBut perhaps to adhere to the example's style, where each assumption is a single property applied to one object. In the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Similarly, here:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- The legs a and b satisfy a² + b² = 1.\n\nOr maybe:\n\n- a and b are the legs of a right triangle.\n- a² + b² = 1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have other assumptions. For instance, in the problem statement, the expression involves exponents with fractions like b²/a². So maybe a and b are positive real numbers, which is implicit in being lengths of a triangle's legs. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- a and b are positive real numbers.\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- a² + b² = 1.\n\nBut the original problem states \"unit right triangle\", so a² + b² =1 is part of the unit hypotenuse. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is a right triangle with legs a and b.\n- a² + b² = 1.\n\nBut since each assumption should be one line, maybe:\n\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- a² + b² = 1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may require that a and b are positive, which is true for triangle sides. So maybe:\n\n- a and b are positive real numbers.\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- a² + b² = 1.\n\nBut perhaps the first is redundant because sides of a triangle are positive. However, to be thorough, including it.\n\nBut looking at the example, the original problem didn't mention that n is positive or anything else, just that n is an integer. So in the example, the assumptions are listed as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So following that, for the current problem, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n1. The triangle is a right triangle.\n2. a² + b² = 1.\n\nBecause those are the given conditions. Even though a and b being positive is necessary, maybe it's considered implicit in the context of triangle sides. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- a² + b² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$1 \\le ab^{b^2/a^2} + ba^{a^2/b^2} < 1 + \\frac{7}{180}.$$\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"Can we show without using calculator that in a unit right triangle 1 ≤ ... <1 + 7/180?\" So the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions as:\n\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- a² + b² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$1 \\le ab^{b^2/a^2} + ba^{a^2/b^2} < 1 + \\frac{7}{180}.$$\n\nBut the user also mentions that the lower bound follows from Young's inequality, but the upper bound needs a better approach. However, the formatted problem should just state the problem to be proven, not the context. The original problem's title and question are asking to prove the inequality, so the problem part is to prove the inequality. The assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed.\n\nHence, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- a² + b² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$1 \\le ab^{b^2/a^2} + ba^{a^2/b^2} < 1 + \\frac{7}{180}.$$\n\nAlternatively, if the problem's main focus is the upper bound, but the user includes both bounds. The problem as stated in the original post is to show the entire inequality, so the problem part should include both inequalities.\n\nChecking the original question again: \"the following inequality about right triangles. Let a² + b² =1 ... then 1 ≤ ... <1 +7/180\". So yes, the problem is to prove both bounds. Therefore, the formatted problem should include both.\n\nThus, the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n- The triangle is a right triangle.\n- $a^2 + b^2 = 1$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$1 \\le ab^{b^2/a^2} + ba^{a^2/b^2} < 1 + \\frac{7}{180}.$$\n###",
