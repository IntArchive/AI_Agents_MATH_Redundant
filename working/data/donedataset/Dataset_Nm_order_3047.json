    "Content": "I'm trying to prove the following statement: Let $R$ be a commutative ring. If $M$ and $N$ are finite length $R$-modules, then $M \\otimes_{R} N$ has finite length, and $\\ell(M\\otimes_{R}N)\\leq\\ell(M)\\cdot\\ell(N)$. I've managed to prove the first part (i.e., $M\\otimes_{R}N$ has finite length), but I don't know how to prove the inequality (I've tried to find a composition series for $M\\otimes_{R}N$, but with no luck so far). A complete answer, or just a few hints would be much appreciated. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you have a short exact sequence $$0\\to M'\\to M\\to M''\\to 0$$ you get another one looking like $$M'\\otimes N\\to M\\otimes N\\to M''\\otimes N\\to 0 \\tag{$\\star$}$$ Suppose that $M$ has finite length and that $M'\\neq0\\neq M''$, so that $M'$ and $M''$ are also of finite length and, in fact, of length smaller than that of $M$. Inductively, you know that $\\ell(M'\\otimes N)\\leq\\ell(M')\\ell(N)$ and $\\ell(M''\\otimes N)\\leq\\ell(M'')\\ell(N)$. Use this and $(\\star)$ to conclude what you want.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the problem. The original question is about proving that the tensor product of two finite length modules over a commutative ring also has finite length, with an inequality involving their lengths.\n\nThe user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line. So, I need to parse the question and extract each individual assumption. The problem states that R is a commutative ring, M and N are finite length R-modules. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nBreaking it down: R is a commutative ring. Then, M is a finite length R-module. Similarly, N is a finite length R-module. These are separate assumptions. The problem part is the inequality statement about the length of the tensor product. The user already proved finite length, so the problem is just the inequality part now. \n\nWait, but in the example given, sometimes assumptions like \"n is divisible by 7\" are included. In the current problem, the original question mentions that M and N are finite length modules. So those are the key assumptions. The ring being commutative is also an assumption because tensor product properties can depend on the ring being commutative. So each of these should be separate lines in the assumption section. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- R is a commutative ring.\n- M is a finite length R-module.\n- N is a finite length R-module.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the length of M⊗N is at most the product of their lengths. The original problem statement includes both parts, but the user says they already proved the finite length part and need help with the inequality. However, the way the format is structured, the problem part should include the entire original problem as stated, but perhaps focusing on the remaining part. Wait, no, the format requires structuring the problem as presented, not the user's progress. The original problem is to prove both that M⊗N has finite length and the inequality. But the user has split it, but in the example, the assumption included n divisible by 7 even though the original problem didn't specify that. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included n divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, the example might have been a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait the example given by the user: Original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem has assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants me to follow their structure. But perhaps in their example, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption? Wait, the example original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless perhaps the user made an error in their example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the current problem as per their format.\n\nSo in the current problem, the user's question is: Let R be a commutative ring. If M and N are finite length R-modules, then M⊗N has finite length, and the inequality. The user has proved the first part and needs help with the inequality. But the problem as stated includes both parts. However, in the formatted problem, should we include all the original problem's parts, even if the user has already solved part of it? The example given in the user's instruction included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the example was from a different problem where that assumption was relevant. \n\nBut perhaps the correct approach here is to list all the assumptions given in the problem statement. The original problem states: Let R be a commutative ring. If M and N are finite length R-modules, then M⊗N has finite length and the inequality. So the assumptions are R commutative, M and N finite length R-modules. Each of these is a separate assumption. So in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\nM is a finite length R-module,\nN is a finite length R-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that M⊗ₖN has finite length and ℓ(M⊗ₖN) ≤ ℓ(M)·ℓ(N).\n\nBut wait, the original problem includes both parts. However, the user mentioned they already proved the finite length part and need help with the inequality. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as given, not the user's progress. So the problem part should be the entire original problem as stated. But in the example, the formatted problem was modified to include an assumption not in the original problem, perhaps incorrectly. However, in the current problem, the assumptions are all in the original problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should list all the original assumptions, each as a separate line, and the problem as stated. So:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\nM is a finite length R-module,\nN is a finite length R-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that M⊗ᵣN has finite length and ℓ(M⊗ᵣN) ≤ ℓ(M)·ℓ(N).\n\nBut the user mentioned that they have already proved the first part (finite length) and need help with the inequality. However, according to the user's instructions, we need to structure the problem as it is presented, not according to the user's progress. Therefore, the problem part should include both parts. But maybe the original problem's main goal is the inequality, but the user split it. However, the original problem says \"the following statement: ... then M⊗N has finite length, and the inequality...\". So the problem is to prove both. So the formatted problem should include both. Unless in the example, the user added an assumption not present in the original problem. But perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Unless perhaps the example was from a different problem. But regardless, we need to follow the user's instruction to structure the current problem correctly. So the current problem's assumptions are:\n\n- R is commutative.\n- M is a finite length R-module.\n- N is a finite length R-module.\n\nProblem: Prove that M⊗ᵣN has finite length and ℓ(M⊗ᵣN) ≤ ℓ(M)·ℓ(N).\n\nBut according to the user's example, perhaps we need to split the problem into parts if there are multiple conditions. But the example's problem part included the entire original problem. So in this case, the problem part should be the entire original problem. But the user's current question mentions that they have proved the first part, but the original problem is to prove both. However, the formatted problem should present the problem as originally stated, not the user's progress. So the problem part should include both. But maybe the user wants to focus on the remaining part. Wait, no. The task is to structure the problem as given, filtered of unrelated information. The original problem is to prove both parts. Therefore, the problem part should state both. However, the user's example included an assumption not present in the original problem. That might be a mistake in the example, but we need to follow the correct approach here.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\nM is a finite length R-module,\nN is a finite length R-module.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $M \\otimes_{R} N$ has finite length, and $\\ell(M\\otimes_{R}N)\\leq\\ell(M)\\cdot\\ell(N)$.\n\nThat seems correct. Each assumption is on its own line, and the problem is stated as is.",
