    "Content": "Let $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a twice differentiable function such that $0 \\le f''(x) \\le f(x)$ $f'(x)\\ge 0, \\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}$ . Thus, prove that $f'(x)\\le f(x), \\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}$ . I couldn't make much progress, but I observed that $f$ is increasing and convex while $f'$ is increasing from the hypothesis. Then I tried to evaluate the derivative of $h:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with $$ h(x)=f(x)-f'(x)$$ and I got that $$h'(x)=f'(x)-f''(x), \\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}$$ Now, I would be done if I could prove that $h'(x)\\ge 0$ for all $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$ . But I'm not sure yet if this approach is really that straightforward. I also tried to use that $f$ is convex, but to no avail. EDIT: Maybe that we should somehow use the fact that a differentiable function $g:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is convex if and only if $g(x)\\ge g(y)+g'(y)(x-y),\\  \\forall x,y\\in \\mathbb{R}$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For a non-negative, increasing, convex function, we have $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) \\geq 0$ exists and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f'(x) = 0$ . Consider: $$\ng(x) = (f(x) - f'(x))e^x\n$$ Differentiating yields: $$\ng'(x) = (f(x) - f''(x))e^x \\geq 0\n$$ We have that $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} g(x) \\geq 0$ . Since $g'(x) \\geq 0$ , $g$ is increasing so this implies $g(x) \\geq 0$ $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ . Since $e^x > 0$ , we have $f(x) \\geq f'(x)$ . EDIT : I'll explain more on the two limits I mentioned at the beginning. $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ exists because of monotone convergence theorem. Take any $(x_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+}$ such that $x_n \\to -\\infty$ , and we may assume WLOG that $x_n$ is monotone (as otherwise we can remove the terms which violate monotonicity, and the asymptotic behavior remains unchanged). Since $x_n \\geq 0$ $\\forall n$ , we have that $x_n$ converges. Since $f(x) \\geq 0$ , the limit must also be non-negative. Similarly, we can prove that $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f'(x) \\geq 0$ as we have $f'(x) \\geq 0$ and $f''(x) \\geq 0$ so $f'$ is a monotonically increasing function bounded from below. We show further that $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f'(x) = 0$ by contradiction, in which if $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f'(x) = \\epsilon > 0$ , then for some $M > 0$ we have $f'(x) > \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$ for all $x < -M$ . This would violate the assumption that $f(x) \\geq 0$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original problem is about proving that f'(x) ≤ f(x) for all real x, given certain conditions on f and its derivatives.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that f: R → R is twice differentiable. Then there are three conditions: 0 ≤ f''(x) ≤ f(x), f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x. Wait, the original problem says \"Let f: R → R be a twice differentiable function such that 0 ≤ f''(x) ≤ f(x) f'(x) ≥ 0, ∀x∈R.\" Hmm, the way it's written might be a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe original problem says the function is twice differentiable, with 0 ≤ f''(x) ≤ f(x), and f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x. So those are separate conditions. So each assumption should be a separate line. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f: R → R is twice differentiable.\n2. For all x in R, 0 ≤ f''(x) ≤ f(x).\n3. For all x in R, f'(x) ≥ 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that f'(x) ≤ f(x) for all x in R.\n\nWait, the user's example had an assumption where \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", each on separate lines. So here, each condition on f should be a separate line.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\nf is twice differentiable,\nFor all x in R, 0 ≤ f''(x) ≤ f(x),\nFor all x in R, f'(x) ≥ 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f'(x) ≤ f(x) for all x in R.\n\nBut let me check the original problem again. The user wrote: \"Let $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a twice differentiable function such that $0 \\le f''(x) \\le f(x)$ $f'(x)\\ge 0, \\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}$ . Thus, prove that $f'(x)\\le f(x), \\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}$.\"\n\nSo the original problem has two conditions after the differentiability: 0 ≤ f'' ≤ f and f' ≥0. So those are separate conditions. Therefore, each should be a separate assumption line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\nf is twice differentiable,\nFor all x in R, 0 ≤ f''(x) ≤ f(x),\nFor all x in R, f'(x) ≥ 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f'(x) ≤ f(x) for all x in R.\n\nI think that's correct. The example given had each condition as separate lines, even if they applied to the same object. In the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate assumptions, both applying to n. Similarly here, the function f has multiple conditions: differentiability, bounds on f'', and non-negativity of f'. Each is a separate line.",
