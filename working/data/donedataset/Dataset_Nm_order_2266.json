    "Content": "I need to show that the vectors $v_1 = \\langle 2, 1\\rangle$ and $v_2 = \\langle 4, 3\\rangle$ span $\\mathbb R^2$ by definition. By definition if I can write any vector in $\\mathbb R^2$ as a linear combination of $v_1$ and $v_2$ then the vectors span $\\mathbb R^2$. How do I show this? Here is what I have been working with: Let $v_x = \\langle c_1, c_2\\rangle$ be any vector in $\\mathbb R^2$ where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are in $\\mathbb R$. $v_x = c_1\\langle 1, 0\\rangle + c_2\\langle 0, 1\\rangle$ Set $v_x$ = a linear combination of $v_1$ and $v_2$? How do I proceed from here?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "What you need to prove is the following: $$\\forall\\,v:=(a,b)\\in\\Bbb R^2\\,\\,\\,\\exists\\,x,y\\in\\Bbb R\\,\\,\\,s.t.\\,\\, v=x(2,1)+y(4,3)\\Longleftrightarrow$$ $$\\Longleftrightarrow \\text{the linear system}\\,\\,\\left\\{\\begin{array}{}2x+4y=a\\\\{}\\\\\\;\\;x+3y=b\\end{array}\\right.$$ has a solution for any $\\,a,b\\in\\Bbb R\\,$ Now, the above system always has a solution (and, in fact, a unique one for each choice of $\\,a,b\\in\\Bbb R\\,$) since the reduced coefficients matrix's determinant is $\\,2\\cdot 3-1\\cdot 4=2\\neq 0\\,$ , and voilá.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that two vectors span R^2 by definition. The user wants me to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then state the problem.\n\nFirst, let's identify the assumptions. The vectors given are v1 = ⟨2, 1⟩ and v2 = ⟨4, 3⟩. The problem is to show they span R^2. By definition, spanning means any vector in R^2 can be written as a linear combination of these two vectors. \n\nSo, the assumptions would include that v1 and v2 are vectors in R^2. Also, the vector to be represented, say v_x = ⟨c1, c2⟩, is an arbitrary vector in R^2. Each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption is a single condition on one object. So here, the vectors are in R^2, and the target vector is any in R^2. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption 1: v1 is a vector in R^2.\nAssumption 2: v2 is a vector in R^2.\nAssumption 3: v_x is any vector in R^2 with components c1 and c2 in R.\n\nBut wait, the problem might not explicitly state all these. The original question says \"Show that the vectors span R^2 by definition.\" So the main objects are v1 and v2. The user is working with v_x as any vector in R^2. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- v1 = ⟨2, 1⟩,\n- v2 = ⟨4, 3⟩,\n- v_x is any vector in R^2 with real components c1 and c2.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to show that v1 and v2 span R^2 by demonstrating any v_x can be written as their linear combination.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction had the problem's assumptions listed as separate lines. So for instance, in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\nv1 is the vector ⟨2, 1⟩,\nv2 is the vector ⟨4, 3⟩,\nv_x is an arbitrary vector in R^2 with components c1 and c2 in R.\n\nProblem: Show that v1 and v2 span R^2 by definition, i.e., any vector v_x in R^2 can be written as a linear combination of v1 and v2.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's user mentions \"by definition\" which requires showing that for any vector in R^2, there exist scalars such that the linear combination equals that vector. So the key assumptions are the definitions of the vectors and the space. Let me check again the example. The example had the problem restated concisely, including the specific expression for A(n). So here, the problem should be restated as \"Show that vectors v1 and v2 span R^2 by definition,\" possibly including the definition part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is exactly as the user wrote: \"Prove that the vectors span R^2 by definition,\" with the assumptions being the specific vectors and the space.\n\nHmm. Let me structure it as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nv1 = ⟨2, 1⟩,\nv2 = ⟨4, 3⟩,\nv_x = ⟨c1, c2⟩ is any vector in R^2 where c1 and c2 are real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nShow that v1 and v2 span R^2 by definition, i.e., any vector v_x can be written as a linear combination of v1 and v2.\n\nEach assumption is a single line. However, in the example, the user had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, each vector and their components, as well as the arbitrary vector's properties, might need to be separate lines. But maybe the vectors are given, so the first two assumptions are the vectors themselves. The third assumption is about the arbitrary vector. Alternatively, maybe the vectors being in R^2 is an assumption? Wait, the problem is in R^2, so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- v1 is a vector in R^2,\n- v2 is a vector in R^2,\n- v_x is an arbitrary vector in R^2 with real components c1 and c2.\n\nBut the original question states the vectors as ⟨2,1⟩ and ⟨4,3⟩, so perhaps specifying their components is part of the assumptions. So each vector's definition is an assumption. Then the arbitrary vector's existence is another assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nv1 is defined as ⟨2, 1⟩,\nv2 is defined as ⟨4, 3⟩,\nv_x is any vector in R^2 with components c1 and c2 in R.\n\nProblem:\nShow that v1 and v2 span R^2 by demonstrating that any vector v_x can be expressed as a linear combination of v1 and v2.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might just be \"Show that vectors v1 and v2 span R^2 by definition,\" with the assumptions being the definitions of the vectors and the space.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the original problem had an expression A(n), and the formatted problem listed the assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, then the problem statement. Here, the vectors are given, so their definitions are assumptions. The arbitrary vector in R^2 is also an assumption. So each of these is a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nv1 is the vector ⟨2, 1⟩,\nv2 is the vector ⟨4, 3⟩,\nv_x is an arbitrary vector in R^2 with components c1 and c2,\nc1 and c2 are real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nShow that v1 and v2 span R^2 by definition, i.e., v_x can be written as a linear combination of v1 and v2.\n\nBut in the example, the problem part includes the mathematical expression. Here, the problem is to show the spanning, so the problem statement is as above. Let me check if this fits the required format. The example's problem part was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is to show the vectors span R^2 by definition. The assumptions are the specific vectors and the arbitrary vector. Each assumption is a separate line. So this should be correct.",
