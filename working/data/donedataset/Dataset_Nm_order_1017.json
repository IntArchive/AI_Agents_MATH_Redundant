    "Content": "This is one of those perhaps rare occasions when someone takes the advice of the FAQ and asks a question to which they already know the answer.  This puzzle took me a while, but I found it both simple and satisfying.  It's also great because the proof doesn't use anything fancy at all but it's still a very nice little result.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's another argument that has the disadvantage of being less elementary, but the advantage of working on all $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k}$ simultaneously.  (This also answers Pete's question in the comments). We're going to apply the Lefshetz fixed point theorem which states the following:  Suppose $f:M\\rightarrow M$ with $M$ \"nice enough\" (certainly, this applies to compact manifolds - I think it applies to all compact CW complexes).  Then $f$ induces a (linear) map $f_*:H_*(M)/Torsion\\rightarrow H_*(M)/Torsion$.  Let $Tr(f)\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ denote the trace of this map.  If $Tr(f)\\neq 0$, then $f$ has a fixed point. Now, we'll show that every diffeomorphism $f:\\mathbb{C}P^{2k}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}P^{2k}$ has trace $\\neq 0$, so that every diffeomorphism has a fixed point.  Believing this for a second, note that every element of $\\pi_1(X)$ for a hypothetical space $X$ covered by $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k}$ acts by diffeomorphisms, and thus has a fixed point.  But it is easy to show that the only element of the deck group which fixes any point must be the identity.  It follows that $\\pi_1(X)$ is trivial, so $X=\\mathbb{C}P^{2k}$. So, why does every diffeomorphism of $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k}$ have a fixed point?  Well, every diffeomorphism (or even homotopy equivalence!) must act as multiplication by $\\pm 1$ on each of the $2k+1$ $\\mathbb{Z}$s in the cohomology ring of $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k}$ and the trace  of the induced map is the sum of all the $\\pm 1$s.  But since there is an odd number of $\\pm 1$s, they can't sum to 0 (by, say, checking the parity), so by the Lefshetz fixed point theorem, every diffeomorphism (or even homotopy equivalence) must have a fixed point. What about $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k+1}$?  Now we must investigate using the ring structure of $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k+1}$.  Since there is a single multiplicative generator, once we know what happens on $H^2(\\mathbb{C}P^{2k+1})$ we know what happens everywhere.  It's easy too see that every orientation preserving homotopy equivalence must have a fixed point: if $f$ is orientation preserving, it's the identity on $H^{4k+2}(\\mathbb{C}P^{2k+1})$, which implies it must have been the identity on $H^2(\\mathbb{C}P^2)$ so it's the identity on all cohomology groups.  Thus, the trace of such an $f$ is $2k+1\\neq 0$, and so, by the Lefshetz theorem, this map has a fixed point. As an immediate corollary, if $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k+1}$ covers anything, it can only double cover it.  For the product of any two nontrivial elements in the deck group must be trivial: any nontrivial map must be orientation reversing and the composition of two orientation reversing maps is orientation preserving, hence has a fixed point, hence is the identity.  That is, any two nontrivial elements product to $e$.  It's easy to show that this implies the Deck group is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (or trivial). In fact $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k+1}$ does double cover something (though, to my knowledge, it doesn't have a more common name, except in the case of $\\mathbb{C}P^1 = S^2$ double covering $\\mathbb{R}P^2$).  In homogeneous coordinates, the involution maps $[z_0:z_1:...:z_{2k+1}:z_{2k+2}]$ to $[-z_1:z_0:...:-z_{2k+2}:z_{2k+1}]$.  This involution acts freely, and the quotient of $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k+1}$ by the involution is a space which $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k+1}$ double covers. I do not know if $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k+1}$ covers anything else. Incidentally, just to preempt a bit, the space $\\mathbb{H}P^{n}$ doesn't cover anything unless $n=1$.  The proof is much more complicated in general (though the case where $n$ is even follows precisely as it did in the $\\mathbb{C}P^{2k}$ case). In general, one needs to compute Pontrjagin classes and note that they are preserved by diffeomorphisms. We have $p_1(\\mathbb{H}P^n) = 2(n-1)x$ where $x$ is a particular choice of generator for $H^4(\\mathbb{H}P^n)$.  Since any diffeomorphism must preserve $p_1$, it follows that so long as $n\\neq 1$, we must have $x\\rightarrow x$ on $H^4$.  Then, the Lefshetz theorem once again guarantees a fixed point.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let's start by understanding the original problem.\n\nThe title of the question is \"Why isn't ℂℙ² a covering space for any other manifold?\" The user mentions they already know the answer but want to present it as a puzzle. The goal is to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem is about ℂℙ² (the complex projective plane) not being a covering space for another manifold. What are the key properties here? \n\nAssumptions should be single properties or conditions applied to one object each. For ℂℙ², important properties might include it being a compact complex manifold, its dimension (which is 2), and its Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic of ℂℙ² is 3, which is a key point because covering spaces have Euler characteristics that are multiples of the base's Euler characteristic. If the base manifold had an Euler characteristic that divides 3, but 3 is prime, the only possibilities are 1 or 3. However, ℂℙ² itself is simply connected, so if it were a covering space, it would have to be the universal cover, but that would imply the fundamental group of the base is trivial, meaning the cover is trivial. So the assumptions would include ℂℙ² being simply connected and having Euler characteristic 3.\n\nWait, the user's example included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe here, the assumptions should list properties of ℂℙ² that are relevant to it being a covering space. Let me check.\n\nThe problem is why ℂℙ² isn't a covering space for another manifold. The key points from algebraic topology would be:\n\n1. ℂℙ² is a simply connected manifold. (Because covering spaces of a space X are related to subgroups of π₁(X), but if ℂℙ² is the covering space, then since it's simply connected, it would be the universal cover of some manifold. But then the fundamental group of the base would have to be trivial, implying the cover is trivial, i.e., the base is ℂℙ² itself. But the question is about covering another manifold, so maybe the assumption is that ℂℙ² is simply connected.)\n\n2. The Euler characteristic of ℂℙ² is 3. (Because if it's a covering space, the Euler characteristic of the base would have to divide 3. Since 3 is prime, the only possibilities are 1 or 3. If the base has Euler characteristic 3, then the covering would be degree 1, which is trivial. If it's 1, then the covering would be degree 3, but such a manifold would have to have certain properties that might not exist.)\n\nBut the problem as stated in the title doesn't mention these properties explicitly. However, in structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions. Wait, but the original problem might not state all assumptions; perhaps some are implicit. For example, in the example given, the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted version included it as an assumption. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted example added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user provided an incorrect example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. Perhaps the example was a typo, but regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the original question.\n\nIn the current case, the original question is \"Why isn't ℂℙ² a covering space for any other manifold?\" So the assumptions here are the properties of ℂℙ² that lead to this conclusion. The answer would involve that ℂℙ² is simply connected and has Euler characteristic 3. So the assumptions should list these properties.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- ℂℙ² is a simply connected compact manifold.\n\n- The Euler characteristic of ℂℙ² is 3.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that ℂℙ² cannot be a covering space for any other manifold.\n\nBut wait, the original problem as stated in the title doesn't mention these properties. So perhaps the structured problem should present those as given assumptions and then pose the problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem includes assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which actually restricts the problem. But that seems inconsistent with the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would make the problem only for n divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to include that as part of the problem's own conditions. Hmm. Perhaps the example is not correctly formatted, but the user wants me to follow their format regardless.\n\nIn any case, following the user's instruction, for the current problem, we need to extract assumptions from the original question. The original question is \"Why isn't ℂℙ² a covering space for any other manifold?\" The answer involves properties of ℂℙ², such as being simply connected and having Euler characteristic 3. But since the question itself doesn't state these, perhaps in structuring the problem, we need to present those as assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that given ℂℙ² with its standard properties, it cannot cover another manifold. But perhaps the assumptions should list the key properties needed to arrive at the conclusion.\n\nSo perhaps the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nℂℙ² is a simply connected compact manifold.\nℂℙ² has Euler characteristic 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ℂℙ² is not a covering space for any other manifold.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is posed as in the title, without additional context, maybe the assumptions are just that ℂℙ² is a complex projective plane (with its usual properties), and the problem is to show it can't be a covering space. But the example given by the user added assumptions that were perhaps not explicit in the original problem. In their example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. Wait, perhaps the original problem was different. Let me check again:\n\nIn the example, the original problem states: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems conflicting. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. This suggests perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. Therefore, perhaps the user expects that when structuring the problem, we might include implicit assumptions or even incorrect ones. However, in the current problem, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated information, and structure it into assumptions and problem.\n\nThe original question is titled \"Why isn't ℂℙ² a covering space for any other manifold?\" and the user mentions it's a puzzle they solved. The body doesn't add much except that it's a nice result using simple methods. So the key here is that ℂℙ² isn't a covering space for any other manifold. To structure this, the assumptions would be the properties of ℂℙ² relevant to covering spaces. Since the answer likely uses that ℂℙ² is simply connected and its Euler characteristic, those are the key points.\n\nThus, the structured problem would have assumptions about ℂℙ² being simply connected and having Euler characteristic 3, leading to the problem of proving it can't cover another manifold.",
