    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is not a complete solution as is indicated in the comments. Joriki's addition is also important. For complete solution, see A. Broughton and B. W. Huff: A comment on unions of sigma-fields. The American Mathematical Monthly , 84, no. 7 (1977), 553-554. (Thanks Didier for the reference) The idea is to find a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets $F_n$ in $\\mathcal F_{n + 1} \\setminus \\mathcal F_n$ and then prove that $F_n$ must actually be an element of $\\mathcal F_n$ if $\\mathcal F = \\bigcup_n \\mathcal F_n$ were a $\\sigma$ -algebra. First, pick a partition $N_1, N_2,\\ldots$ of infinite sets of $\\mathbb N$ and set $$A_i = \\bigcup_{n \\in N_i} F_n.$$ So, by assumption $A_i$ is an element of $\\mathcal F$ . So, for every $i$ we have an $n_i$ such that $A_i \\in \\mathcal F_{n_i}$ . Now, note that since $(\\mathcal F_n)$ is strictly increasing, so we can choose $(n_i)$ to be strictly increasing as well. Okay, nice. So now for every $j$ we can pick an integer $m_j \\in N_j$ such that $m_j > n_j$ . So now we set $$B = \\bigcup_n F_{m_n} \\in \\mathcal F.$$ So, eventually (for large $n$ ) $B$ will belong to all $\\mathcal F_n$ . So, eventually $B$ is in some $\\mathcal F_{n_k}$ (since $n_i$ is strictly increasing). By construction we now have that $$A_k \\cap B = F_{m_k} \\in \\mathcal F_{n_k}.$$ But! $n_k < m_k$ so $A_{m_k} \\notin \\mathcal F_{n_k}$ . Contradiction. So, now what is left is to show that such a disjoint sequence exists. Well, that is quite messy, so I will only add it if you want. I would like to add that this is not my idea but that I have got the idea from somewhere in the past, but I forgot exactly where from.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"The union of a strictly increasing sequence of σ-algebras is not a σ-algebra\". The question states that if we have a sequence of σ-algebras where each inclusion is strict, then their union is not a σ-algebra. \n\nSo, the problem here is to prove that the union of a strictly increasing sequence of σ-algebras isn't a σ-algebra. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. There's a sequence of σ-algebras, denoted as F_n.\n2. Each inclusion F_n in F_{n+1} is strict, meaning F_n is a proper subset of F_{n+1}.\n\nEach of these should be separate assumptions. The original problem mentions \"the union of a sequence of σ-algebras need not be a σ-algebra\" but the stronger statement is when the inclusions are strict. So the main assumptions are the strict inclusions. \n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on its own line. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate line. Here, the sequence being a strictly increasing (strict inclusion) is one assumption, and the existence of the sequence of σ-algebras is another. Wait, maybe not. The problem states \"Let F_n be a sequence of σ-algebras. If the inclusion F_n ⊊ F_{n+1} is strict...\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- F_n is a sequence of σ-algebras.\n- For each n, F_n is a strict subset of F_{n+1}.\n\nSo each of these should be separate. The first is that we have a sequence of σ-algebras, the second is that each is strictly contained in the next. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: \nEach F_n is a σ-algebra,\nFor all n, F_n is a strict subset of F_{n+1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that the union ⋃_{n=1}^∞ F_n is not a σ-algebra.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"the union of a sequence of σ-algebras need not be a σ-algebra, but how to prove the stronger statement...\" The stronger statement is that if the inclusions are strict, then the union is not a σ-algebra. So the problem is exactly as stated. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. Each assumption is separate, and the problem is to prove the union isn't a σ-algebra under those conditions.",
