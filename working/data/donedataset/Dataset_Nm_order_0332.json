    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think this was a V.I Arnold problem (correct me if I am wrong). I think have seen this solution to your problem before: The statement $2^k$ starts with a $7$ is equivalent to the existence of an integer $m$ such that $ \\frac{2^k}{10^m} \\in [7, 8)$. Now we just need to show that the set of all numbers of the above form is dense in the set of real numbers. Showing that $\\{ \\frac{2^n}{5^m} : m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is dense is good enough (cancelled powers of two). Apply the function $\\log_2$ to the fraction. This function is continuous, so it is enough to prove that $\\{ n-m\\log_2{5} :m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$ is dense. This is an additive group, which is not cyclic since $\\log_2 {5}$ is irrational (and $\\implies$ $1$ and $\\log_2 {5}$ cannot both be integer multiples of the same number). It follows that this group is dense in the real numbers. Hence the statement is true. We also have the existence of such a number in any non-empty open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$, which implies that there are infinite powers of two starting with any string of integers.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem: Show that there are infinitely many powers of 2 starting with the digit 7. Hmm, interesting. So, I need to prove that there are infinitely many integers n such that 2^n starts with 7. \n\nFirst, I remember that a number starts with a digit 7 if when written in decimal form, the first digit is 7. That means the number is between 7*10^k and 8*10^k for some integer k. For example, 70-79, 700-799, 7000-7999, etc. So, 2^n must lie in one of these intervals for infinitely many n.\n\nLet me think about logarithms here. Taking the logarithm base 10 of 2^n would give me n*log10(2). The idea is that the fractional part of this logarithm determines the leading digits. Because the logarithm of a number starting with 7 would have a fractional part such that 10^{fractional part} is between 7 and 8. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nIf 2^n = 7... then in scientific notation, 2^n = 7 * 10^k * ... So, log10(2^n) = log10(7 * 10^k) = log10(7) + k. Therefore, n*log10(2) = k + log10(7), where k is an integer. So, if we let the fractional part of n*log10(2) be between log10(7) and log10(8), then 2^n starts with 7.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to showing that the fractional parts of n*log10(2) are dense in [0,1), or more specifically, that they fall into the interval [log10(7), log10(8)) infinitely often. \n\nI remember something about equidistribution or maybe Kronecker's theorem here. Since log10(2) is irrational, the sequence {n*log10(2)} (where {x} is the fractional part of x) is dense in [0,1). Therefore, it should intersect the interval [log10(7), log10(8)) infinitely many times. That would mean there are infinitely many n such that 2^n starts with 7.\n\nWait, but how do we know log10(2) is irrational? If log10(2) is rational, then its fractional parts might not be dense. Let me check. Suppose log10(2) = a/b where a and b are integers. Then 10^{a/b} = 2, which implies 10^a = 2^b. But 10^a = 2^a * 5^a, so 2^a *5^a = 2^b. This would require 5^a = 2^{b -a}. The left side is a power of 5, and the right side is a power of 2. The only way this is possible is if a=0, but then 10^0=1≠2. Therefore, log10(2) is irrational. Okay, so the fractional parts are dense.\n\nSince the fractional parts are dense in [0,1), the sequence {n*log10(2)} will enter the interval [log10(7), log10(8)) infinitely often. Each time it does, that corresponds to an n where 2^n starts with 7. Therefore, there are infinitely many such n.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is from contest math, so maybe they expect a more elementary approach without invoking equidistribution. Maybe using the pigeonhole principle or Dirichlet's approximation theorem? Let me think.\n\nIf we consider the fractional parts of n*log10(2). Since log10(2) is irrational, by Dirichlet's theorem, for any ε>0, there are infinitely many n such that the fractional part of n*log10(2) is within ε of some point. But maybe that's not the exact statement. Alternatively, using pigeonhole principle: For any N, consider the N+1 fractional parts {0*log10(2)}, {1*log10(2)}, ..., {N*log10(2)}. These are N+1 points in [0,1), so by pigeonhole, at least two are within 1/N of each other. The difference between them would be {k*log10(2) - m*log10(2)} = {(k - m)*log10(2)}, which is within 1/N. So, this gives that there are multiples of log10(2) that get arbitrarily close to integers, which might help in showing density.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that the multiplicative group generated by 2 modulo 10^k is cyclic? Not sure. Wait, another approach: For a number to start with 7, its logarithm mod 1 must lie in [log10(7), log10(8)). Since log10(2) is irrational, the sequence {n log10 2} is equidistributed mod 1, which implies that the proportion of n for which the fractional part lies in that interval is log10(8) - log10(7) ≈ 0.05799. So, infinitely many n's.\n\nBut maybe in contest math, you can use equidistribution theorem or just density. But perhaps more elementarily, by showing that the fractional parts come arbitrarily close to any point, hence they enter the interval [log10(7), log10(8)) infinitely often. So, since the fractional parts are dense, there must be infinitely many n such that {n log10 2} ∈ [log10 7, log10 8), which implies 2^n starts with 7.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that for any real number α, the sequence {n α} is dense in [0,1) if α is irrational. Therefore, since log10 2 is irrational, the sequence {n log10 2} is dense, so hits [log10 7, log10 8) infinitely often. Therefore, there are infinitely many n such that 2^n starts with 7.\n\nI think that's the key idea. So the assumptions here are that log10(2) is irrational, which we proved earlier, and that the fractional parts of n log10(2) are dense in [0,1). Therefore, the problem is to show that there are infinitely many n where the fractional part lies in that interval. \n\nBut the problem statement as given is just \"Show that there are infinitely many powers of two starting with the digit 7.\" So in structuring the problem, the assumptions would be what? The problem doesn't state any prior conditions, so perhaps the only assumption is that we're dealing with powers of 2 in base 10. So in the format requested:\n\nAssumption: Each power of 2 is a positive integer written in base 10.\n\nProblem: Show that there are infinitely many powers of two starting with the digit 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't have any explicit assumptions except that we're talking about powers of 2 in base 10. So maybe in the assumption part, just list that 2^n is considered as a base 10 number. The example given in the user had an assumption like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But in this problem, there are no explicit conditions on n, except that n is a positive integer (since we're talking about powers of 2). But the original problem didn't specify, so maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: \nn is a positive integer,\nThe number 2^n is written in base 10.\n\nProblem: Show that there are infinitely many powers of two starting with the digit 7.\n\nBut the example given had assumptions that were part of the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which actually makes the problem different. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But perhaps they intended to filter the problem's actual assumptions. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a mistake. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem example:\n\nProve that for every integer n, the number  \nA(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n)  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So maybe the user made a mistake here. Therefore, perhaps in their example, the problem actually required n divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it was stated as \"for every integer n\". So maybe there was an error. \n\nBut given that, perhaps in the current problem, we need to extract any hidden assumptions. But the problem as stated is \"Show that there are infinitely many powers of two starting with the digit 7.\" The only assumptions needed are that we're talking about powers of 2 as base 10 numbers, and n is a positive integer. Since the problem is as stated, maybe the assumptions are minimal. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe number 2^n is written in base 10.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there are infinitely many powers of two starting with the digit 7.\n\nBut maybe in the original problem, the user's example included an assumption that wasn't explicitly stated. But in the current problem, there are no such hidden assumptions. So perhaps the only assumption is that we're considering powers of 2 in base 10. But the user's example included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so maybe the assumption is redundant. But following the example, maybe we need to list all the necessary conditions as assumptions. In this case, n being a positive integer (since 2^n is a positive integer when n is a positive integer), and 2^n is written in base 10. So yes, those are the assumptions.",
