    "Content": "A while ago one of my professors gave the class a problem \"to think about when lying on the beach.\" Well, I've been on the beach several times since then to no avail and my curiosity has finally outweighed my desire to solve this personally. The problem is this: Let $a_1, \\dotsc, a_n\\in\\mathbb{C}$ be distinct. Prove that: \\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n\\prod_{j\\neq i}\\frac{1}{a_i - a_j} = 0\n\\end{equation} It's pretty easy, if tedious, to show this for a given $n$ but I'm unsure about how to generalise the result.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, assume $\\prod a_i \\ne 0$ Now consider the $(n-1)^{th}$ degree polynomial $$P(z) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\prod_{j \\neq i} \\frac{z-a_j}{a_i - a_j }$$ We see that $P(a_i) = a_i$ for each $i$ Thus $P(z) - z $ has at least $n$ roots, and thus must be identically $0$. $$ z \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\prod_{j \\neq i} \\frac{z-a_j}{a_i - a_j }$$ Now put $z= 0$ in the above divide by $(-1)^n\\prod a_i$ to get your identity. If $\\prod a_i = 0$, then wlog, assume $a_1 = 0$. Now take a sequence of complex numbers $c_n \\to a_1$, $c_n \\neq 0$, and use $c_n$ instead of $a_1$ and take limits.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The task is to prove that the sum of the product of reciprocals of differences between distinct complex numbers is zero. Hmm, okay, so we have distinct complex numbers a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ. For each i, we take the product of 1/(a_i - a_j) for all j not equal to i, and then sum those products over all i from 1 to n. And we need to show that this sum equals zero.\n\nFirst, I need to recall if there's any similar expressions in mathematics that I know of. This reminds me of Lagrange interpolation polynomials. Let me think. In Lagrange interpolation, we construct a polynomial that passes through a given set of points. The basis polynomials for Lagrange interpolation are given by L_i(x) = Π_{j≠i} (x - a_j)/(a_i - a_j). So each L_i(x) is a polynomial of degree n-1, and when evaluated at x = a_i, it equals 1, and at x = a_j (j≠i), it equals 0.\n\nWait a second, the expression given in the problem is the sum over i of Π_{j≠i} 1/(a_i - a_j). If I compare this to the Lagrange basis polynomials, L_i(x) has (x - a_j) in the numerator, but here we have just 1/(a_i - a_j). So maybe if we set x to some specific value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider differentiating something. Let's think about polynomials again. Suppose we have a polynomial P(x) = Π_{k=1}^n (x - a_k). Then the derivative P'(a_i) would be Π_{j≠i} (a_i - a_j). That's because the derivative of P at a_i is the product of (a_i - a_j) for all j≠i. Therefore, 1/P'(a_i) is exactly Π_{j≠i} 1/(a_i - a_j). So the sum in the problem is the sum over i of 1/P'(a_i).\n\nSo the problem reduces to showing that the sum of 1/P'(a_i) from i=1 to n is zero. How can this be? Maybe there's an identity involving the derivatives at the roots of a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, consider constructing a function f(x) that is the sum over i of 1/(P'(a_i)) * 1/(x - a_i). If we can show that this function is identically zero, then perhaps evaluating it at a certain point would give the result. Wait, but the sum given in the problem is the sum of 1/P'(a_i), not multiplied by anything else. So maybe evaluating some function at x approaching infinity?\n\nAlternatively, consider partial fractions. If we look at the sum over i of [1/P'(a_i)] * [1/(x - a_i)], then this is a partial fraction decomposition of some rational function. But what would that rational function be? Let's see. If we have a rational function Q(x)/P(x), where Q(x) is a polynomial of degree less than n, then its partial fraction decomposition would be sum_{i=1}^n Q(a_i)/P'(a_i) * 1/(x - a_i). So if we take Q(x) as a constant polynomial, say Q(x) = 1, then the decomposition would be sum_{i=1}^n 1/P'(a_i) * 1/(x - a_i) = 1/P(x). But wait, 1/P(x) is equal to sum_{i=1}^n [1/(P'(a_i)(x - a_i))]. So if we set x to some value, maybe we can get an equation involving the sum of 1/P'(a_i).\n\nBut the problem is that the given sum is sum_{i=1}^n 1/P'(a_i), which is the sum of the residues of 1/P(x). Wait, the integral of 1/P(x) around a contour that encloses all the roots a_i would be 2πi times the sum of the residues, which is 2πi times sum_{i=1}^n 1/P'(a_i). But if we can show that the integral of 1/P(x) over a large contour tends to zero as the radius tends to infinity, then the sum of the residues would be zero. Since P(x) is a polynomial of degree n, 1/P(x) behaves like 1/x^n for large x. The integral over a circle of radius R would be roughly 1/R^n * 2πR, which tends to zero as R→∞ if n ≥ 2. Therefore, the sum of the residues must be zero. Therefore, sum_{i=1}^n 1/P'(a_i) = 0. That's exactly the result we need to prove. So the problem is proven via complex analysis.\n\nBut the problem states that a₁, ..., aₙ are distinct complex numbers, so n must be at least 2. Wait, for n=1, the sum would be undefined because there are no j≠i. So n is at least 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a purely algebraic proof. Let's consider the case when n=2. Then the sum is 1/(a₁ - a₂) + 1/(a₂ - a₁) = 0. That works. For n=3, compute the sum:\n\n1/[(a₁ - a₂)(a₁ - a₃)] + 1/[(a₂ - a₁)(a₂ - a₃)] + 1/[(a₃ - a₁)(a₃ - a₂)]. Let me compute this for specific values. Let a₁=1, a₂=2, a₃=3. Then the first term is 1/[(1-2)(1-3)] = 1/[(-1)(-2)] = 1/2. Second term: 1/[(2-1)(2-3)] = 1/[(1)(-1)] = -1. Third term: 1/[(3-1)(3-2)] = 1/[(2)(1)] = 1/2. Sum: 1/2 -1 +1/2 = 0. So it works. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, consider the polynomial Q(x) = sum_{i=1}^n [Π_{j≠i} (x - a_j)] / [Π_{j≠i} (a_i - a_j)]. Then Q(x) is the Lagrange interpolation polynomial that interpolates the function f(x)=1 at all points a_i. Therefore, Q(x) ≡ 1. Therefore, the coefficients of x^{n-1} in Q(x) must be zero (since Q(x) is a constant polynomial). But the coefficient of x^{n-1} in Q(x) is sum_{i=1}^n [1 / Π_{j≠i} (a_i - a_j)]. Therefore, this sum must be zero. Hence, the desired result.\n\nWait, let's elaborate. If we construct the Lagrange interpolation polynomial Q(x) that satisfies Q(a_i) = 1 for all i, then Q(x) is the sum over i of [Π_{j≠i} (x - a_j)] / [Π_{j≠i} (a_i - a_j)]. Since all the Q(a_i) = 1, and Q(x) is a polynomial of degree at most n-1. But if all n points are interpolated to the constant function 1, then Q(x) must be identically 1. Therefore, the polynomial Q(x) - 1 is zero at all n distinct points a_i, and is a polynomial of degree at most n-1. The only such polynomial is the zero polynomial. Therefore, Q(x) = 1 for all x.\n\nNow, consider the leading term of Q(x). The leading term of each term in the sum is x^{n-1} divided by Π_{j≠i} (a_i - a_j). Therefore, the coefficient of x^{n-1} in Q(x) is sum_{i=1}^n [1 / Π_{j≠i} (a_i - a_j)]. But since Q(x) = 1, which is a constant polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} must be zero. Therefore, sum_{i=1}^n [1 / Π_{j≠i} (a_i - a_j)] = 0. Which is exactly the identity we need to prove. Therefore, this gives a proof using Lagrange interpolation.\n\nSo that's the solution. The key idea is to recognize the sum as the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the Lagrange interpolation polynomial that is identically 1, which must have zero coefficient for x^{n-1}, hence the sum is zero.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are that the a_i are distinct complex numbers, and the problem is to show that the sum of those products is zero.",
