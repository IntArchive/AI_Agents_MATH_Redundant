    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking to show that a certain Riemann sum equals an integral. The problem involves a continuous force field F from R^n to R^n and a C^1 curve gamma defined on [a, b]. The partition P of [a, b] is given with equally spaced points, leading to a Delta t of (b-a)/n. The goal is to prove that the limit of the Riemann sum involving F evaluated at gamma(t_k^*) dotted with the difference quotient of gamma over each subinterval times Delta t equals the integral of F(gamma(t)) dotted with gamma'(t) dt from a to b. Additionally, this should equal another Riemann sum where instead of the difference quotient, gamma'(t_k^*) is used.\n\nThe user then proceeds with their own attempt, applying the mean value theorem componentwise, using uniform continuity of gamma', and bounding various terms with epsilon. They use the fact that gamma' is uniformly continuous because it's continuous on a compact interval, hence achieving the delta needed. Then they split the norm using triangle inequality and bound each part, leading to an expression involving epsilon multiplied by some constants and Delta t. They mention the maximum value M of ||F(gamma(t))|| due to continuity on a compact set, leading to the final bound which can be made arbitrarily small by choosing epsilon appropriately.\n\nNow, to structure this according to the given format. The task is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem concisely.\n\nFirst, let's extract the assumptions from the problem statement. The original problem states:\n\n- F: R^n → R^n is a continuous function (force field).\n- gamma: [a, b] → R^n is a C^1 curve, meaning it is continuously differentiable.\n- The partition P of [a, b] is defined with equally spaced points t_0 = a, t_1 = a + (b-a)/n, ..., t_n = b, so Delta t = (b-a)/n.\n- The Riemann sum uses the inner product of F(gamma(t_k^*)) and the difference quotient (gamma(t_k) - gamma(t_{k-1}))/(t_k - t_{k-1}) times Delta t.\n- The goal is to show this sum converges to the integral of <F(gamma(t)), gamma'(t)> dt, which is also equal to another Riemann sum using gamma'(t_k^*).\n\nFrom the user's proof attempt, additional assumptions might be inferred, such as the use of the mean value theorem componentwise, which requires gamma being C^1. Also, uniform continuity of gamma' is used, which follows from gamma' being continuous on [a, b], a compact interval, hence uniformly continuous.\n\nBut in the problem statement itself, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. F is continuous.\n2. gamma is in C^1, i.e., continuously differentiable.\n3. The partition P is regular with Delta t = (b - a)/n.\n4. The limit is taken as n approaches infinity (so the mesh of the partition goes to zero).\n\nWait, the problem statement says gamma is in C^1, so that's an assumption. The force field F is continuous. The partition is regular (equal subintervals). The tags t_k^* are presumably arbitrary in each subinterval, but since the problem is about showing the Riemann sum converges to the integral, maybe the choice of tags doesn't matter as long as the mesh goes to zero. However, in the user's proof, they use specific properties from the mean value theorem, which might require particular choices (like using the left endpoint or something), but the problem as stated doesn't specify the tags, so maybe they are arbitrary. However, the problem doesn't state any restrictions on the tags, so perhaps that's an implicit assumption that the limit holds for any choice of tags.\n\nBut the key assumptions from the problem are:\n\n- F: R^n → R^n is continuous.\n- gamma: [a, b] → R^n is in C^1 (i.e., continuously differentiable).\n- The partition is regular with mesh Delta t = (b - a)/n.\n- The limit is as n → ∞ (so mesh tends to zero).\n\nNow, the problem is to show that the Riemann sum equals the integral, and also equals another Riemann sum with gamma' evaluated at t_k^*.\n\nIn the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the user didn't state any such specific divisibility. However, the problem as posed might have hidden assumptions from the context. For example, the partition being regular (equal intervals) is an assumption. The tags t_k^* are points in each subinterval [t_{k-1}, t_k], but the problem doesn't specify where they are chosen, so perhaps the result holds regardless of the choice of tags, which would be another assumption if necessary. However, the problem as stated by the user doesn't mention the tags being arbitrary, but since they are using the mean value theorem, they might be choosing specific tags where the derivative equals the difference quotient. Wait, in their proof, they use the mean value theorem to write gamma(t_k) - gamma(t_{k-1}) = gamma'(xi_i)(t_k - t_{k-1}) for some xi_i in (t_{k-1}, t_k). Then, they compare the difference quotient (gamma(t_k) - gamma(t_{k-1}))/Delta t to gamma'(t_{k}^*). But in their approach, they choose the tags t_k^* such that the difference quotient is approximated by gamma' at nearby points. However, in the problem statement, the tags t_k^* could be arbitrary. But the problem is to show that regardless of the choice of t_k^*, the Riemann sum converges to the integral. Wait, but in the user's proof, they might be assuming that the tags are chosen in a way that allows the approximation, but the problem statement as written just says \"t_k^*\" without specifying. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the tags are arbitrary as long as they are in each subinterval. But the key assumptions are about F and gamma.\n\nSo, to list the assumptions:\n\n1. F: R^n → R^n is continuous.\n2. gamma: [a, b] → R^n is continuously differentiable (C^1).\n3. The partition P of [a, b] is regular with subintervals of length Delta t = (b - a)/n.\n4. The limit is taken as n approaches infinity (so Delta t → 0).\n\nAdditionally, the problem might implicitly assume that the tags t_k^* are chosen within each subinterval [t_{k-1}, t_k], but since the problem statement doesn't specify any constraints on the tags, perhaps this is part of the problem's general Riemann sum definition. However, in Riemann sums for integrals, the limit is usually taken as the mesh goes to zero, regardless of the choice of tags. So perhaps an assumption here is that t_k^* is any point in [t_{k-1}, t_k} for each k.\n\nBut since the problem is to show the equality of two different Riemann sums (one using the difference quotient and another using the derivative at the tag points), the key is that the difference quotient approaches the derivative uniformly due to gamma being C^1. Thus, the user's approach uses the uniform continuity of gamma', which comes from gamma' being continuous on [a, b], hence uniformly continuous.\n\nBut in terms of assumptions for the problem, these are the given conditions. So the problem's assumptions are the continuity of F, the C^1 regularity of gamma, the regular partition, and the limit as n → ∞.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- F: R^n → R^n is continuous.\n- γ: [a, b] → R^n is continuously differentiable.\n- The partition P of [a, b] is regular with Δt = (b - a)/n.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that \n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left\\langle \\mathbf{F}(\\gamma(t_{k}^{*})), \\frac{\\gamma(t_{k}) - \\gamma(t_{k-1})}{t_{k} - t_{k-1}} \\right\\rangle \\Delta t = \\int_{a}^{b} \\left\\langle \\mathbf{F}(\\gamma(t)), \\gamma'(t) \\right\\rangle dt\n$$\nand that this equals\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left\\langle \\mathbf{F}(\\gamma(t_{k}^{*})), \\gamma'(t_{k}^{*}) \\right\\rangle \\Delta t.\n$$\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wrote the two expressions as equal, so the problem is to show the equality between the Riemann sum with the difference quotient and the integral, and also that this is equal to the Riemann sum using the derivative at the tags.\n\nNow, checking if each assumption is listed properly, each on a separate line addressing one property.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a continuous function from R^n to R^n,\nγ is a continuously differentiable curve from [a, b] to R^n,\nThe partition P of [a, b] is regular with Δt = (b - a)/n,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the limit of the Riemann sum with the difference quotient equals the integral and equals the limit of the Riemann sum with γ' evaluated at t_k^*.\n\nBut wait, in the example given in the prompt, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was listed as two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition.\n\nSimilarly, here, each assumption should be a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nF: R^n → R^n is continuous,\nγ: [a, b] → R^n is continuously differentiable,\nThe partition P of [a, b] is regular with Δt = (b - a)/n,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nHowever, the partition being regular (i.e., equal subintervals) is one condition. The limit as n approaches infinity (so mesh size goes to zero) is another. But in the problem statement, the partition is defined explicitly with t_k = a + k(b - a)/n, so it's a regular partition. So that's one assumption. The limit as n → ∞ is part of the problem's statement. But maybe as an assumption, it's that the sum is taken in the limit as n → ∞.\n\nWait, the problem says \"I want to show that [the limit as n → ∞ of the sum equals the integral...]\". So the problem is about taking the limit as n approaches infinity. So perhaps the assumption is that the limit is taken as n approaches infinity. But this is part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Hmm, the example given included assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem's inherent conditions.\n\nWait, the example's original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but that seems wrong because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was incorrect. But perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but the instruction is to follow the format. However, in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions as given in the problem statement, not adding extra ones.\n\nWait, the original example may have been a misrepresentation. Let me check:\n\nThe original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem's conclusion is that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. However, 91 = 13*7, so maybe the proof requires that n is divisible by 6 or something, but the formatted problem's assumptions seem to be adding unnecessary conditions. This might be an error in the example. However, perhaps the original problem had a typo or the formatted version was incorrect. But regardless, the instruction is to follow the format, listing all assumptions from the problem.\n\nSo, returning to the current problem. The user's problem is to show the equality of the Riemann sum and the integral. The key assumptions from the problem statement are:\n\n1. F is continuous.\n2. γ is C^1.\n3. The partition is regular (equal width).\n4. The limit is as n → ∞.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that maybe the assumptions include both the general conditions and any specific ones needed for the proof. However, in the current problem, the user is presenting their own proof attempt, but the task is to structure the problem as per the original question, not the proof. So we need to extract the problem's assumptions from the question, not the proof attempt.\n\nThe original question states:\n\n\"Suppose we have some continuous function F: R^n → R^n and a curve γ: [a, b] → R^n in C^1. Considering the partition P of [a, b] [...] I want to show that [the limit equals the integral...]\"\n\nSo the explicit assumptions are:\n\n- F is continuous.\n- γ is in C^1.\n- The partition P is regular (equally spaced points).\n- The sum is using tags t_k^* (though their specific location isn't restricted beyond being in the subinterval).\n\nBut since the problem is about showing the Riemann sum converges to the integral, the key assumptions are the continuity of F and the C^1 nature of γ. The regular partition is part of the setup but not necessarily an assumption beyond the definition of the sum. However, in the formatted problem, assumptions include properties given in the problem statement. For example, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was formatted as \"n is an integer\". So here, the assumptions are:\n\n1. F is continuous.\n2. γ is continuously differentiable.\n3. The partition P is regular with Δt = (b - a)/n.\n4. The limit is taken as n → ∞.\n\nThus, each of these should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to show that the given Riemann sum equals the integral and the other Riemann sum. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then state the problem to show the equality.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nF: R^n → R^n is continuous,\nγ: [a, b] → R^n is continuously differentiable,\nThe partition P of [a, b] is regular with Δt = (b - a)/n,\nThe limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left\\langle \\mathbf{F}(\\gamma(t_{k}^{*})), \\frac{\\gamma(t_{k}) - \\gamma(t_{k-1})}{t_{k} - t_{k-1}} \\right\\rangle \\Delta t = \\int_{a}^{b} \\left\\langle \\mathbf{F}(\\gamma(t)), \\gamma'(t) \\right\\rangle dt = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left\\langle \\mathbf{F}(\\gamma(t_{k}^{*})), \\gamma'(t_{k}^{*}) \\right\\rangle \\Delta t.\n$$\n\nBut in the original problem, the user wrote the two equalities together, so the problem is to show both that the Riemann sum with the difference quotient converges to the integral and that it's equal to the other Riemann sum with the derivative at the tags. So the problem statement as formatted should capture both equalities.\n\nAdditionally, checking for any other assumptions. For instance, the problem may implicitly use that [a, b] is a compact interval, hence gamma' is uniformly continuous, but that's a consequence of γ being C^1, which is already listed as an assumption. The continuity of F is needed for the integral to exist, and the Riemann sum to converge.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should have the four assumptions listed line by line and the problem statement as above.",
