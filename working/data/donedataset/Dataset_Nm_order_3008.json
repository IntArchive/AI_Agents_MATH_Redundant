I want to prove that : 1) $x \\otimes y - y \\otimes x \\neq 0 $ in  $I \\otimes_{R} I$ 2) $x \\otimes y - y \\otimes x $ is a torsion element My thoughts: to prove that $x \\otimes y - y \\otimes x \\neq 0 $ in  $I \\otimes_{R} I$ probably I should find a bilinear map $$\\phi : I \\times I \\to R$$ such that $\\phi(x,y) \\neq \\phi (y,x)$ , but which one?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that $k$ is a commutative ring, put $t:=x\\otimes y-y\\otimes x$, and identify $k$ to $R/I$. 1) Using the $R$-bilinear map \n$$\nI\\times I\\to k,\\qquad(f,g)\\mapsto\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(0,0)\\ \n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}(0,0),\n$$ \nit is easy to see that $t$ is nonzero. 2) We have $xyt=0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving two things: first, that the element x⊗y - y⊗x is not zero in I⊗_R I, and second, that this element is a torsion element. The user also mentions their thoughts about finding a bilinear map to show the non-vanishing of the tensor. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. Let me parse through the problem statement. \n\nThe problem starts by defining R as k[x,y], where k is a field. Then I is the ideal (x,y). The first part is to prove that x⊗y - y⊗x ≠ 0 in I⊗_R I. The second part is to show this element is torsion. The user's thoughts mention finding a bilinear map that distinguishes x⊗y from y⊗x. \n\nSo the assumptions here would be the given definitions and conditions. Let me list them one by one, each as a separate point. \n\n1. R is the polynomial ring k[x,y], where k is a field. So R = k[x,y].\n2. I is the ideal generated by x and y in R, so I = (x,y).\n3. The problem is set in the context of the tensor product I⊗_R I. So the tensor product is over R.\n4. The elements in consideration are x⊗y and y⊗x, so x and y are elements of I.\n5. The problem asks about properties of x⊗y - y⊗x in this tensor product. \n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"I⊗_{R} I\". So the tensor product is taken over R. That's an important point. Also, since I is an R-module, the tensor product I⊗_R I is an R-module as well. \n\nThe problem has two parts: 1) showing that x⊗y - y⊗x ≠ 0, and 2) showing that this element is torsion. However, the user's example only included one problem statement. Wait, the original instruction says to structure the problem according to the format, which includes listing assumptions and then the problem. The example had a single problem, but here the original question has two parts. However, the user's example seems to have modified the original problem (the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem). Wait, actually in the example given by the user, they restructured the original problem which was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's confusing. Wait no, maybe the example was an illustration of how to structure, but perhaps the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and in the formatted problem, they added n divisible by 7? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is not from an actual problem but constructed by the user. So perhaps the example is illustrative but not accurate. Anyway, the key is that in the current problem, the user wants the assumptions broken down into individual conditions applied to one object each.\n\nSo for the current problem: \n\nOriginal assumptions (given in the problem statement):\n\n- R = k[x,y], where k is a field.\n- I = (x,y) (the ideal generated by x and y in R).\n- The problem is about elements in I⊗_R I.\n\nSo each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nR is the polynomial ring k[x,y], where k is a field,\nI is the ideal (x,y) in R,\nThe tensor product is taken over R,\nx and y are elements of I.\n\nWait, but \"x and y are elements of I\" is inherent since I is generated by x and y. So maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the key assumptions are R, I, and that the tensor product is over R. Also, that k is a field. \n\nWait, the problem is to show that x⊗y - y⊗x ≠ 0 in I⊗_R I. So the elements x and y are in I, which is given by I = (x,y). So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. R = k[x,y], where k is a field.\n2. I is the ideal (x,y) in R.\n3. The tensor product I⊗_R I is considered.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove two things, but the user's example only includes one problem. However, in the original instruction, the user says \"structure that problem as the following format\" which includes \"Problem: <The problem>\". So perhaps each part (1 and 2) needs to be separate problems. But the example only had one problem. Wait, the user's instruction says \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So maybe the user wants each part as a separate problem with assumptions. But given the example, which combines multiple conditions into one problem, perhaps the current problem should be split into two separate entries. However, the user hasn't specified. The original question on Math SE has two parts: 1 and 2. But when structuring, perhaps each part should be a separate problem. But the example given by the user includes a single problem. So maybe we need to list both parts under the problem section. However, in the example, the problem was restructured with an added assumption (n divisible by 7), which wasn't in the original. Wait, perhaps the original example had a mistake. Anyway, focusing on the current problem.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n1) Prove that x⊗y - y⊗x ≠ 0 in I⊗_R I.\n\n2) Prove that x⊗y - y⊗x is a torsion element.\n\nSo, the user's task is to structure this as per the format. The original example may have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the example given by the user in the instruction was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to illustrate how to extract assumptions, but in reality, the original problem didn't have that assumption. So perhaps the example is not accurate. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are just the given definitions, and the problem is to prove the two parts. But the format requires that assumptions are listed, each on a separate line, each addressing one property. \n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- R is the polynomial ring k[x,y], where k is a field.\n\n- I is the ideal (x,y) in R.\n\n- The tensor product I⊗_R I is considered.\n\nProblem:\n\n1) Prove that x⊗y - y⊗x ≠ 0 in I⊗_R I.\n\n2) Prove that x⊗y - y⊗x is a torsion element in I⊗_R I.\n\nBut the user's example combines the problem into one. However, in the original problem, there are two separate parts. The user's example might have structured a problem with added assumptions. But given the instructions, perhaps we need to list each part as a separate problem. However, the user's format shows a single problem. So maybe we need to present both parts under the same problem, as two items. But the example's problem is a single statement. Alternatively, perhaps each part is a separate problem with the same assumptions. However, the user hasn't specified splitting into multiple problems, so perhaps we need to list both as part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants each part as a separate problem, each with their own assumptions. But in this case, the assumptions would be the same for both. But since the original question has two parts, maybe we need to structure both under one problem. Let me check the example again. The example took the original problem, which was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and in the formatted problem, added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in the example, the user modified the problem by adding an assumption. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, we need to filter any unrelated information and list the essential assumptions. \n\nThe original problem mentions k is a field, R = k[x,y], I = (x,y), and the problem is about elements in I⊗_R I. So the essential assumptions are R, I, the field k, and the tensor product over R. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is the polynomial ring k[x,y], where k is a field,\nI is the ideal (x,y) in R,\nThe tensor product I⊗_R I is considered,\nx and y are elements of I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. x⊗y - y⊗x ≠ 0 in I⊗_R I,\n2. x⊗y - y⊗x is a torsion element in I⊗_R I.\n\nBut since the example's problem is a single statement, maybe we need to combine both parts into one problem statement. Alternatively, the problem could be written as two separate problems. However, the original instruction's example includes a problem with a single statement. Given that, perhaps we need to present both parts as a single problem with two items. Alternatively, maybe the answer should list each part as a separate problem. But the user hasn't specified. Given the example, the problem is written as a single statement. Therefore, perhaps we should combine both parts into the problem statement.\n\nBut the original question has two distinct parts. Maybe the answer should reflect both. Alternatively, perhaps the user only wants the first part. But the original question includes both. Given that, I'll structure both parts into the problem statement, separated by commas or as a list. However, since in the example the problem is a single sentence, maybe we need to write both parts in one sentence. For example:\n\nProblem: Prove that in I⊗_R I, the element x⊗y - y⊗x is non-zero and is a torsion element.\n\nBut the original problem lists them as two separate points. To be precise, perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that:\n1) x⊗y - y⊗x ≠ 0 in I⊗_R I,\n2) x⊗y - y⊗x is a torsion element in I⊗_R I.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is a single statement. The example's problem is \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps in this case, the problem can be written as two sentences in the problem section. Alternatively, if the format requires a single problem, perhaps we need to mention both parts. \n\nGiven that, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is the polynomial ring k[x,y], where k is a field,\nI is the ideal (x,y) in R,\nThe tensor product is taken over R,\nx and y are elements of I.\n\nProblem:\nProve that x⊗y - y⊗x ≠ 0 in I⊗_R I and that this element is a torsion element.\n\nAlternatively, split into two points. But according to the example, the problem is one sentence. So maybe combine them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should include that k is a field. Let me check each assumption:\n\n1. R = k[x,y], where k is a field. (This combines two pieces: R is k[x,y], and k is a field. However, per the instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe split into two assumptions: R is the polynomial ring k[x,y], and k is a field.)\n\nBut R is defined as k[x,y], so perhaps \"R is the polynomial ring k[x,y]\" and \"k is a field\" are separate assumptions.\n\nSimilarly, I is the ideal (x,y) in R. That's another assumption.\n\nThe tensor product is over R: so the tensor product I⊗_R I is considered.\n\nx and y are elements of I: since I is generated by x and y, this is inherent, but perhaps it's redundant. Maybe not necessary as a separate assumption.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the elements x and y are generators of I, so they are elements of I. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- R is the polynomial ring k[x,y].\n- k is a field.\n- I is the ideal generated by x and y in R.\n- The tensor product I⊗_R I is considered.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is the two parts.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nR is the polynomial ring k[x,y],\nk is a field,\nI is the ideal (x,y) in R,\nThe tensor product I⊗_R I is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. x⊗y - y⊗x ≠ 0 in I⊗_R I,\n2. x⊗y - y⊗x is a torsion element in I⊗_R I.\n\nBut the example's problem is a single statement, so maybe we need to write both parts in a single problem line. Alternatively, perhaps the user allows for listing them as 1 and 2. Given that the example didn't have multiple parts, but the current problem does, it's better to list them explicitly. However, the problem section in the example is a single line. To adhere to the format, perhaps combine both into one sentence.\n\nProblem: Prove that x⊗y - y⊗x is non-zero and a torsion element in I⊗_R I.\n\nAlternatively, if the system allows, use semicolons or commas. However, the example uses a single mathematical statement. Given that, perhaps the answer should list both parts in the problem line as two separate sentences. But since the format is flexible, I'll proceed to structure it accordingly.",
