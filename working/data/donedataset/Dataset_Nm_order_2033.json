    "Content": "$6$ and $210$ share the property that both are the products of both two and three consecutive numbers. $6$ is $2\\times3$ and $1\\times2\\times3$ and $210$ is $14\\times15$ and $5\\times6\\times7$. It was easy enough to write a program to search for more numbers with this property, I found that there were no more up to at least $1{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000$ ($1$ Trillion). But it is beyond me to prove that there are either no more numbers like this or to find the next one. Any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In his book Diophantine equation ,(page $257-258$) L.J.Mordell proved that the equation $$y(y+1)=x(x+1)(x+2)$$ has only the integer solutions $x=-1,-2,0,1,5.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that there are no more positive integers beyond 6 and 210 that are products of both two and three consecutive numbers. So, first, I need to structure the problem properly by listing the assumptions and stating the problem clearly based on the given example.\n\nLooking at the original question, the key points are:\n- The numbers 6 and 210 can be expressed both as the product of two consecutive integers and three consecutive integers.\n- The user checked up to 1 trillion and found no others, but they need a proof.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n1. The number is a positive integer.\n2. The number can be expressed as the product of two consecutive integers. That is, there exists some integer m such that the number equals m(m+1).\n3. The same number can also be expressed as the product of three consecutive integers. So, there exists some integer k such that the number equals k(k+1)(k+2).\n\nThe problem then is to prove that the only numbers satisfying both conditions are 6 and 210. Alternatively, to show there are no other solutions beyond these two.\n\nWait, the original question mentions \"products of 2 and 3 consecutive numbers\". So the problem is to find all positive integers that are both the product of two consecutive integers and the product of three consecutive integers. The user claims that only 6 and 210 exist, and wants a proof that no more exist.\n\nSo the assumptions should list the necessary conditions for a number to satisfy both representations. Each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The number is a positive integer.\n- The number is the product of two consecutive positive integers.\n- The number is the product of three consecutive positive integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that the only positive integers which are both products of two and three consecutive positive integers are 6 and 210.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is about the existence of such numbers. So the structure should list the properties the number must satisfy. Each assumption line should be a separate condition. Since the number must satisfy both being a product of two and three consecutive numbers, those are separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The number is a positive integer.\n- The number can be written as the product of two consecutive positive integers.\n- The number can be written as the product of three consecutive positive integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that the only such numbers are 6 and 210.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption listed that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the number (not a variable n) being a positive integer and satisfying the two product conditions.\n\nI think this structure captures the problem accurately. The user wants to show that no other numbers besides 6 and 210 meet all three assumptions. So, the formatted problem should list those three assumptions and then state the problem as proving only 6 and 210 exist.",
