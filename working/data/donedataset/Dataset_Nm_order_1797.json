    "Content": "Let $f,g,\\alpha:[a,b]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with $\\alpha$ increasing and $f,g \\in \\mathscr{R}(\\alpha)$, and $p,q>0$ with $\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$. Prove that $$\\left|\\int_a^b f(x)g(x)d\\alpha\\right|\\leq \\left(\\int_a^b \\left|f(x)\\right|^p d\\alpha \\right)^{1/p} \\left(\\int_a^b \\left|g(x)\\right|^q d\\alpha \\right)^{1/q}$$ I am using Young's inequality, which states that for $a,b>0$, $uv\\leq \\frac{1}{p}u^{p}+\\frac{1}{q}v^{q}$. This gets me as far as showing that $$\\left|\\int_a^b f(x)g(x)d\\alpha\\right|\\leq \\int\\left( \\frac {1}{p}|f(x)|^p +\\frac{1}{q}|g(x)|^q\\right)d\\alpha$$ But here I'm stuck. I'm vaguely thinking that I could use the fact that $\\frac {1}{p}|f(x)|^p +\\frac{1}{q}|g(x)|^q$ is a convex combination and so if I do some Jensen's inequality type thing, but I can't figure out a way to make it work out.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $\\displaystyle\\int_a^b \\left|f(x)\\right|^p d\\alpha\\neq 0$ and  $\\displaystyle\\int_a^b \\left|g(x)\\right|^q d\\alpha\\neq 0$. Otherwise, if $\\displaystyle\\int_a^b \\left|f(x)\\right|^p d\\alpha=0$, then $f\\equiv 0$ a.e. and the Holder's inequality is trivial in this case. Now applying Young's inequality with $u=\\displaystyle\\frac{|f(x)|}{(\\int_a^b \\left|f(x)\\right|^p d\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{p}}}$ and $v=\\displaystyle\\frac{|g(x)|}{(\\int_a^b \\left|g(x)\\right|^q d\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{q}}}$, we have\n$$\\frac{|f(x)|}{(\\int_a^b \\left|f(x)\\right|^p d\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{p}}}\\cdot\\frac{|g(x)|}{(\\int_a^b \\left|g(x)\\right|^q d\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{q}}}\\leq\\frac{1}{p}\\frac{|f(x)|^p}{\\int_a^b \\left|f(x)\\right|^p d\\alpha}+\\frac{1}{q}\\frac{|g(x)|^q}{\\int_a^b \\left|g(x)\\right|^q d\\alpha}.$$\nIntegrating it from $a$ to $b$ with respect to $d\\alpha$, we obtain\n$$\\frac{\\int_a^b|f(x)||g(x)|d\\alpha}{(\\int_a^b \\left|f(x)\\right|^p d\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{p}}(\\int_a^b \\left|g(x)\\right|^q d\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{q}}}\\leq\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$$\nwhich implies that \n$$ \\tag{1}\\int_a^b|f(x)||g(x)|d\\alpha\\leq\\left(\\int_a^b \\left|f(x)\\right|^p d\\alpha \\right)^{1/p} \\left(\\int_a^b \\left|g(x)\\right|^q d\\alpha \\right)^{1/q}.$$\nNow the inequality which we want to prove follows from $(1)$ and the inequality\n$$\\left|\\int_a^b f(x)g(x)d\\alpha\\right|\\leq\\int_a^b|f(x)||g(x)|d\\alpha.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and format it correctly. The user wants me to act as a math professor, filtering the original question into the specified format with Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving Hölder's Inequality. Let me read through the question carefully. The user mentioned functions f, g, α defined on [a,b] with α increasing, and f, g are in R(α), meaning Riemann-Stieltjes integrable with respect to α. Also, p and q are positive numbers such that 1/p + 1/q = 1. The goal is to prove that the absolute value of the integral of f(x)g(x) dα is less than or equal to the product of the L^p and L^q norms.\n\nThe example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So I need to break down the given conditions into individual assumptions. Let's list them:\n\n1. α: [a, b] → ℝ is increasing.\n2. f: [a, b] → ℝ is in R(α), i.e., Riemann-Stieltjes integrable with respect to α.\n3. g: [a, b] → ℝ is in R(α) as well.\n4. p and q are positive real numbers.\n5. 1/p + 1/q = 1.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines under Assumption. The problem statement then is to prove the inequality given.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"with α increasing and f,g ∈ R(α)\", so these are the conditions. The user also references Young's inequality and gets stuck after applying it. But for the formatted problem, we just need the assumptions and the problem statement. The rest of the user's thought process (about Young's, Jensen's) is part of their attempt and should be excluded.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- α: [a, b] → ℝ is an increasing function.\n- f: [a, b] → ℝ is Riemann-Stieltjes integrable with respect to α.\n- g: [a, b] → ℝ is Riemann-Stieltjes integrable with respect to α.\n- p and q are positive real numbers.\n- The equation 1/p + 1/q = 1 holds.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\left|\\int_a^b f(x)g(x)d\\alpha\\right|\\leq \\left(\\int_a^b \\left|f(x)\\right|^p d\\alpha \\right)^{1/p} \\left(\\int_a^b \\left|g(x)\\right|^q d\\alpha \\right)^{1/q}.$$\n\nI need to check if each assumption is a single condition per line. The first three are separate: α increasing, f ∈ R(α), g ∈ R(α). Then p, q > 0, and the conjugate exponents condition. That should cover all the given assumptions in the problem statement. The rest, like using Young's inequality, is part of the attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So this should be the correct formatted version.",
