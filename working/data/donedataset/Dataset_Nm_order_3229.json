    "Content": "I have calculated the real and imaginary parts of $\\dfrac{\\sin z}z.$ I've obtained $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{\\sin z}z&=&\\frac{\\sin(x+iy)}{(x+iy)}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{\\sin(x)\\cosh(y)+i\\cos(x)\\sinh(y)}{x+iy}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{x\\sin(x)\\cosh(y)+y\\cos(x)\\sinh(y)}{x^2+y^2}+i\\frac{x\\cos(x)\\sinh(y)-y\\sin(x)\\cosh(y)}{x^2+y^2}.\n\\end{eqnarray}$$ Before calculating it, I hoped I could use this in a solution to a certain problem, but I would need to differentiate the real and imaginary parts of $\\dfrac{\\sin z}z$ with regard to $x$ and $y$. But what I'm getting is very complicated. I understand that it could be that that's just the way it is. But maybe there are some simplifications to be done either in the functions or in their derivatives? I've never really used hyperbolic functions before so I'm not sure I'm not missing something. Added. The problem I'm working on is the following. Prove that the solutions of the equation $$\\tan z=z$$ are all real. I will sketch the solution I know here. It can be calculated that $$\\tan(x+iy)=\\frac{\\sin(2x)}{\\cos(2x)+\\cosh(2y)}+i\\frac{\\sinh(2y)}{\\cos(2x)+\\cosh(2y)}.$$ Plugging this to the equation, we get $$\\begin{eqnarray}\nx&=&\\frac{\\sin(2x)}{\\cos(2x)+\\cosh(2y)}\\\\\ny&=&\\frac{\\sinh(2y)}{\\cos(2x)+\\cosh(2y)}.\n\\end{eqnarray}$$ From this we can get $$\\sin(2x)\\cdot2y=\\sinh(2y)\\cdot2x.$$ By plotting the functions $\\sin,$ $\\mathrm{id}$ and $\\sinh$ (and proving the right inequalities we can see from the plots), we can see that this is only possible when $xy=0$. But when we plug $x=0$ to the second equation, we can show that the only solution is $y=0$, which ends the proof. What strikes me in this solution is the fact that $\\dfrac{\\sin z}z$ is used. (Not explicitly in my statement.) This function has another connection to the problem: The non-zero solutions of the equation $\\tan z=z$ are exactly the zeros of the derivative of $\\dfrac{\\sin z}z.$ This is easy to prove. I wondered if there shouldn't be a solution to the problem which uses this fact, given that $\\dfrac{\\sin z}z$ appears in the solution I know.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The function $f$ defined by $$\nf(z) = \\frac{\\sin z}{z}\n$$ is nonconstant, entire, of order $1$ , and of genus either $0$ or $1$ . Since $f(z)$ is real for real $z$ and all zeros of $f$ are real, Laguerre's theorem on separation of zeros implies that all zeros of $f'$ are real (and separated by the zeros of $f$). I figured I'd give a more self-contained answer, essentially replicating the proof of Laguerre's theorem. We have $$\nf(z) = \\frac{\\sin z}{z} = \\prod_{n \\neq 0} \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{\\pi n}\\right) e^{z/(\\pi n)}.\n$$ From this we get $$\n\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} = \\sum_{n \\neq 0} \\left(\\frac{1}{z - \\pi n} + \\frac{1}{\\pi n}\\right),\n$$ so that, if $z = x+iy$, $$\n\\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\\right) = -y \\sum_{n \\neq 0} \\frac{1}{(x-\\pi n)^2+y^2},\n$$ which cannot vanish unless $y = 0$.  Thus $f'$ has only real zeros. (Additionally, by showing that $[f'(x)/f(x)]' < 0$ where $f(x) \\neq 0$, one can see that $f'/f$ has exactly one zero between each pair of zeros of $f$.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original question on Math Stack Exchange is about simplifying the real and imaginary parts of (sin z)/z, and then connecting it to proving that all solutions of tan z = z are real. The user also mentions that in the solution they know, they end up using properties of (sin z)/z, and they wonder if there's a different approach using the fact that the non-zero solutions of tan z = z are zeros of the derivative of (sin z)/z.\n\nBut the task here is to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement. Looking at the example provided, assumptions are specific conditions applied to one object each. The example had n as an integer and n divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition per line.\n\nLooking at the problem the user is working on: Prove that the solutions of the equation tan z = z are all real. The user mentions a specific approach involving the real and imaginary parts of (sin z)/z and their derivatives, but the core problem is to prove that all solutions are real.\n\nSo the main problem is to prove that all solutions of tan z = z are real. The assumptions here might relate to properties of z, perhaps that z is a complex number (since otherwise, if z were real, the statement would be trivial). However, in the original problem statement, the user is working within complex analysis, considering z as a complex variable. So the key assumption is that z is a complex number, but the conclusion is that such z must actually be real.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to show that any solution z to tan z = z must be real. So perhaps the assumptions are about z being a complex number (since otherwise, if we assume z is real, there's nothing to prove). But maybe the problem itself doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond z being a complex solution. However, the user's approach involves splitting into real and imaginary parts, which suggests considering z = x + iy where x and y are real numbers.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions needed here are:\n\n- z is a complex number of the form z = x + iy where x and y are real numbers.\n\nBut the problem is to show that any solution z to tan z = z must have y = 0, hence z is real. Therefore, the assumption is that z is a complex number (since otherwise, if z is already real, the equation is just tan x = x, which is the case we know). However, in the problem statement, the user wants to prove that all solutions are real, so the problem is stated without assuming z is real. Therefore, the assumption might be that z is a complex number (but that's inherent in the problem's context). Alternatively, the problem might not require additional assumptions beyond the equation itself.\n\nWait, the example given in the original query had assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. In the current problem, the user is trying to prove that all solutions to tan z = z are real. The problem as stated doesn't have explicit conditions beyond z being a complex number (since otherwise, if z is real, the equation is already real). Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is that z is a complex number satisfying tan z = z, but that's part of the problem statement.\n\nHowever, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, which was included in the formatted problem's assumptions. So in the current case, maybe the assumption is that z is a complex number (but in complex analysis, variables are complex by default unless stated otherwise). However, the example included specific conditions, so perhaps here the assumption is that z is a complex number, and the problem is to show that such z must be real.\n\nBut the user's own solution splits z into real and imaginary parts, so maybe the assumption is that z = x + iy with x, y real. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond z being a solution to tan z = z.\n\nWait, the example's formatted problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user in that example added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that might have been part of their specific problem's conditions. Wait, no, looking back, the original example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. However, in the formatted problem, the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is the assumption n divisible by 7? That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was structured incorrectly. But perhaps the user intended to show that when structuring, they might have included incorrect assumptions. However, I should follow the user's example as given, even if there's a mistake.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. The original question includes a lot of details, but the core problem to structure is: Prove that the solutions of the equation tan z = z are all real.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which perhaps were not in the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems like an error in the example. However, the user provided that example, so I need to follow their format even if it's incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, and the correct assumptions would just be n is an integer. However, given that, in the current problem, I need to extract assumptions from the problem as described by the user.\n\nLooking at the user's problem: They mention that they calculated the real and imaginary parts of sin z / z, and then they are working on proving that all solutions of tan z = z are real. The problem they state is: \"Prove that the solutions of the equation tan z = z are all real.\"\n\nIn their solution sketch, they split z into x + iy and derive equations. So the key assumption here is that z is a complex number (since otherwise, if z is real, there's nothing to prove). But in the problem statement, they need to prove that all solutions are real, so the assumption would be that z is a solution (complex or real) to tan z = z, and the conclusion is that such z must be real. However, in terms of assumptions for the problem, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond z being a solution. But the user's approach involves splitting into real and imaginary parts, so maybe the assumption is that z is a complex number expressed as z = x + iy where x, y are real numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is just to prove that any solution z to tan z = z must be real. In that case, the assumption would be that z is a solution to tan z = z, and the problem is to show that such z is real.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. So here, the assumption is that z is a complex number (since the problem is to show that any solution is real). Wait, but in complex analysis, variables are assumed to be complex unless stated otherwise. So maybe the assumption is implicit. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is part of the problem's original statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to prove that all solutions to tan z = z are real. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- z is a complex number.\n- tan z = z.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a complex number,\ntan z = z.\n\nProblem:\nProve that z is real.\n\nBut the original problem statement is \"Prove that the solutions of the equation tan z = z are all real.\" So the formatted problem would have assumptions that z is a complex number and that tan z = z, and the problem is to show z is real.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only assumption is that z satisfies tan z = z, and the problem is to prove that z is real. But in complex analysis, z is by default a complex variable, so maybe the assumption is just that z is a solution to tan z = z, and the problem is to show that such z must be real.\n\nBut the example given by the user included two assumptions for the problem: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. So the user in their example mistakenly added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7), perhaps as a typo. But regardless, following their format, each assumption is a single condition per line.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's own solution involves considering z = x + iy with x, y real. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- z = x + iy where x and y are real numbers,\n- tan z = z.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that y = 0 (i.e., z is real). Alternatively, the problem could be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a complex number of the form x + iy with x, y ∈ ℝ,\ntan z = z.\n\nProblem:\nProve that y = 0.\n\nBut the original problem statement is to prove that all solutions are real. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- z is a complex number,\n- tan z = z.\n\nProblem:\nProve that z is real.\n\nAlternatively, considering the user's own approach, they split z into real and imaginary parts. Therefore, the assumption would be that z is expressed as x + iy with x and y real. So:\n\nAssumption:\nz = x + iy where x and y are real numbers,\ntan z = z.\n\nProblem:\nProve that y = 0.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n, so the assumptions should be just n is an integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but I need to follow the structure they provided.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the key is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The user mentions that in their solution, they split z into real and imaginary parts, so the assumption that z is a complex number expressed as x + iy with x, y real is important. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. z is a complex number of the form z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers.\n2. tan z = z.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that y = 0 (i.e., z is real).\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the example's structure, which included two assumptions (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7) for a problem that originally stated \"for every integer n\", perhaps here we need to list the components that define the problem.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a complex number,\ntan z = z.\n\nProblem:\nProve that z is real.\n\nBut since the user's solution involves splitting into real and imaginary parts, maybe the assumption about z being expressed as x + iy is necessary. However, in complex analysis, any complex number can be written as x + iy, so that's inherent. But perhaps to make it explicit, the assumption is that z = x + iy with x, y real.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a complex number expressed as z = x + iy with x, y ∈ ℝ,\ntan z = z.\n\nProblem:\nProve that y = 0.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Similarly, here, the problem is to prove that y = 0 (i.e., z is real) given that z is a complex number of the form x + iy satisfying tan z = z.\n\nBut the original problem statement is \"Prove that the solutions of the equation tan z = z are all real.\" So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- z is a solution to the equation tan z = z.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that z is real. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), so here the assumptions would be:\n\n- z is a complex number,\n- tan z = z.\n\nProblem:\nProve that z is real.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the problem is about solutions in the complex plane, then the first assumption is that z is a complex number, and the second is that it satisfies tan z = z. Then the problem is to show it's real.\n\nI think this is the correct approach. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a complex number,\ntan z = z.\n\nProblem:\nProve that z is real.\n\nBut the user's own approach splits z into real and imaginary parts, so perhaps to make that explicit, the assumption should include that decomposition. However, in complex numbers, that's always possible. Maybe it's better to include it for clarity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as stated doesn't need the decomposition as an assumption because it's inherent. The example didn't include such decomposition for the variable n; it just listed properties of n.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nz is a complex number,\ntan z = z.\n\nProblem:\nProve that z is real.\n\nThat's concise and matches the problem statement. The splitting into real and imaginary parts is part of the solution method, not the problem's assumptions.",
