    "Content": "Please excuse the selfishness of the following question: Let $G$ be a group and $H \\le G$ such that $|G:H|=2$. Show that $H$ is normal. Proof: Because $|G:H|=2$, $G = H \\cup aH$ for some $a \\in G \\setminus H$. Let $x\\in G$. Then $x \\in H$ or $x \\in aH$. Suppose $x \\in H$. Then $xhx^{-1} \\in H$ because $H$ is a group. Suppose $x \\in aH$. Then $ahH(ah)^{-1} = ahHh^{-1}a^{-1} = a(hHh^{-1})a^{-1}$ ***1 ***1: Can I say now that $x \\in H$, based on the that $hHh^{-1} \\in H$ and that $aa^{-1} = e$ ? Thank you for the time you spent reading my doubts.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To answer your question, \"No.\" It is true that $ahH(ah)^{-1}=ahHh^{-1}a^{-1}=aHa^{-1}$ (since $h,h^{-1} \\in H$ we have $hHh^{-1}=H$). But it is not generally true that $aHa^{-1}=H$. In fact, if you make this jump, you are essentially assuming what you're trying to prove! Let's work with an element instead to better see what needs to be done. Suppose $x\\in aH$. Then there exists some $h\\in H$ such that $x=ah$. Now suppose $k \\in H$ and consider $xkx^{-1}=ahkh^{-1}a^{-1}$ [We need to show $xkx^{-1}\\in H$]. Notice that $a hkh^{-1} \\in aH$ and thus $ahkh^{-1} \\not\\in H$. Also, $H \\not= Ha$ since $a \\not\\in H$. Therefore, $ahkh^{-1}$ does not belong to $H$ and thus must belong to the only other right coset: $Ha$. Thus there exists some $h' \\in H$ such that $ahkh^{-1}=h'a$. So $xkx^{-1}=ahkh^{-1}a^{-1}=h'aa^{-1}=h' \\in H$ and so $xHx^{-1} \\subseteq H$. And thus we arrive at the most convoluted proof of the index 2 theorem I've ever seen. :) It's better to work with the condition (usually used as a definition of normality): \"$H$ is normal in $G$ if and only if its left and right cosets are equal.\" First, recall that cosets partition the group. So if there are only two cosets (one of which is the subgroup itself), then the second coset must be the stuff that's left over. So the cosets of $H$ in $G$ are $H$ and $G-H = \\{x\\in G\\;|\\; x\\not\\in H\\}$ (the complement of $H$ in $G$). Let $x\\in G$. Case 1: $x\\in H$. Then $xH=H=Hx$. Case 2: $x\\not\\in H$. Then $xH \\not= H$ and so $xH=G-H$. Likewise $Hx \\not= H$ so $Hx=G-H$. Therefore, $xH=G-H=Hx$. Thus the left and right of cosets match so $H$ is normal in $G$. The idea behind the theorem is that the subgroup itself is always both a left and right coset. So if there are only two cosets, there's not enough room for the non-subgroup coset to be mismatched. Now if the index is three more can happen. In this case there is room for cosets to be mismatched and thus $H$ wouldn't necessarily normal. For example: $H = \\{ (1),(12) \\}$ is a subgroup of index 3 in $S_3$ (permutations of ${1,2,3}$). But $H$ is not normal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified structure. Let me start by understanding the example they provided. The original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then, the problem statement followed.\n\nNow, looking at the current problem from Math Stack Exchange: the title is \"Subgroup of index $2$ is Normal\". The user wants to structure this into Assumptions and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, the original question states: Let $G$ be a group and $H \\le G$ such that $|G:H|=2$. Show that $H$ is normal.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about $n$ being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, we need to list each assumption. The group $G$ is given, and $H$ is a subgroup with index 2. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. $G$ is a group.\n2. $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ (denoted $H \\le G$).\n3. The index of $H$ in $G$ is 2 (i.e., $|G:H|=2$).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applying to one object. Then, the problem is to show that $H$ is normal in $G$. \n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention anything else, so these three should suffice. The user also mentioned filtering unrelated information. The proof attempt and the specific question about the step (***1) in the original post can be ignored since the task is to structure the problem, not the discussion or the proof.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: \n- $G$ is a group,\n- $H$ is a subgroup of $G$,\n- The index of $H$ in $G$ is 2.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Show that H is normal.\" In the example, they used \"Prove that...\". But the problem here is to show H is normal, which is equivalent to proving it's a normal subgroup. So the problem statement is correct as is. Also, making sure that each assumption is one line per condition. The index being 2 is separate from H being a subgroup. Yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's all. The example didn't include the proof attempt, so the formatted problem should just have the assumptions and the problem statement.",
