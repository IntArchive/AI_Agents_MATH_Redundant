    "Content": "I'm reading the Algebra book by Knapp and he mentions in passing that an orthonormal set in an infinite dimension vector space is \"never large enough\" to be a vector-space basis (i.e. that every vector can be written as a finite sum of vectors from the basis; such bases do exist for infinite dimension vector spaces by virtue of the axiom of choice, but usually one works with orthonormal sets for which infinite sums yield all the elements of the vector space). So my question is - how can we prove this claim? (That an orthonormal set in an infinite dimension vector space is not a vector space basis). Edit (by Jonas Meyer): Knapp says in a footnote on page 92 of Basic algebra : In the infinite-dimensional theory the term \"orthonormal basis\" is used for an orthonormal set that spans $V$ when limits of finite sums are allowed, in addition to finite sums themselves; when $V$ is infinite-dimensional, an orthonormal basis is never large enough to be a vector-space basis. Thus, without explicitly using the word, Knapp is referring only to complete infinite-dimensional inner product spaces.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Edit. The answer assumes that one works in a Hilbert space. Let $\\mathcal A$ denote the set of orthonormal vectors. Then for any orthonormal sequence $(e_n)\\subset\\mathcal A $,  the element \n$$u=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}e_n$$\ncannot be represented as a finite sum of vectors from  $\\mathcal A$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem is restated clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is \"An orthonormal set cannot be a basis in an infinite dimension vector space?\" The user is asking how to prove that an orthonormal set in an infinite-dimensional vector space isn't a vector space basis (where basis means a Hamel basis, i.e., every vector is a finite combination of basis elements). \n\nKnapp's book mentions that orthonormal sets can't be large enough for this. The edit note clarifies that Knapp is talking about complete infinite-dimensional inner product spaces, and that orthonormal bases in this context allow infinite sums, unlike Hamel bases which only use finite sums.\n\nSo, to structure the problem correctly, I need to list the assumptions. Let's see:\n\n1. The vector space is infinite-dimensional. That's one assumption.\n2. The vector space is a complete inner product space (i.e., a Hilbert space) because Knapp refers to spaces where infinite sums are allowed, which implies completeness.\n3. There's an orthonormal set in this space. The problem is about such sets not being a vector space basis (Hamel basis), which only allows finite linear combinations.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"vector space\" but the edit mentions that Knapp is referring to complete spaces. So maybe the assumptions should include that it's a Hilbert space (complete) and infinite-dimensional. Also, the orthonormal set is considered as a candidate for a basis where only finite sums are allowed.\n\nSo, each assumption should be single. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Each is a separate line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nHere, the problem is about an orthonormal set not being a vector space basis (Hamel basis) in an infinite-dimensional vector space. But the context given by the edit says Knapp is talking about complete infinite-dimensional inner product spaces. So maybe the vector space is a Hilbert space (complete), which is infinite-dimensional. The orthonormal set is a subset of this space, and the question is to prove it can't be a Hamel basis.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The vector space is infinite-dimensional.\n- The vector space is a complete inner product space (Hilbert space).\n- The orthonormal set is considered as a candidate for a vector space basis (Hamel basis), where every vector is a finite linear combination of basis elements.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property of one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is infinite-dimensional,\nThe vector space is a complete inner product space (Hilbert space),\nThe orthonormal set is a subset of the vector space,\nA vector space basis (Hamel basis) allows only finite linear combinations of basis vectors.\n\nProblem: Prove that the orthonormal set cannot be a vector space basis.\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions are more about the objects in the problem. Here, the problem is in the context of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. So the key assumptions are that the space is infinite-dimensional and a Hilbert space (complete), and that we're considering an orthonormal set. The problem is to show such a set can't be a Hamel basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the completeness is not part of the assumption but part of the problem's context. Wait, the edit says Knapp is referring to complete infinite-dimensional inner product spaces. So to be precise, the assumptions should include completeness and infinite-dimensionality.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is a complete inner product space (Hilbert space),\nThe vector space is infinite-dimensional,\nAn orthonormal set is a subset of the vector space,\nA vector space basis (Hamel basis) requires every vector to be expressed as a finite linear combination of basis elements.\n\nProblem: Prove that the orthonormal set cannot be a vector space basis.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is a single line, each applying to one object. The first line is about the vector space being a Hilbert space (combining completeness and inner product), the second its dimension, third the orthonormal set, and fourth the definition of Hamel basis. However, the fourth point is more of a definition rather than an assumption. But in the example, they included the divisibility condition as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually in the example, the user restructured the problem and added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So it seems like in the example, they changed the problem by adding an assumption. Maybe the user is showing how to filter the problem and structure it with assumptions. But in this case, the problem as stated in the question already has certain conditions. Wait, maybe the example is a bad one, but according to the user's example, the formatted problem includes assumptions that might not all come directly from the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So the user restructured the problem by adding an assumption. Maybe that example is a mistake. But the user wants me to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated info, and structure it as per the format. So in this case, the original question is: How to prove an orthonormal set in an infinite-dimensional vector space is not a vector space basis (Hamel basis). The key points are: infinite-dimensional vector space, orthonormal set, Hamel basis (finite sums). The edit mentions that Knapp is talking about complete inner product spaces (Hilbert spaces). So the problem is set in a Hilbert space. Therefore, the assumptions should be: the space is a Hilbert space (complete inner product), infinite-dimensional, and the orthonormal set is considered as a candidate for a Hamel basis. So the assumptions would be: - The vector space is a complete inner product space (Hilbert space). - The vector space is infinite-dimensional. - The orthonormal set is a subset of the vector space. The problem is to prove this set is not a vector space basis (Hamel basis). However, the definition of a Hamel basis is that every vector is a finite combination. Maybe that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Alternatively, the assumption is that the basis in question allows only finite linear combinations. But in the problem statement, the user wants to prove that an orthonormal set can't be a vector space basis. Since a vector space basis (Hamel basis) by definition requires finite combinations, perhaps that's not an assumption but part of the problem's context. So perhaps the key assumptions are: 1. The vector space is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. 2. The orthonormal set is a subset of the vector space. Then, the problem is to prove that this orthonormal set cannot be a vector space basis (i.e., a Hamel basis). Wait, but the Hilbert space is a specific type of vector space. So maybe breaking it down: - The vector space is equipped with an inner product (making it an inner product space). - The vector space is complete with respect to the norm induced by the inner product (i.e., it is a Hilbert space). - The vector space is infinite-dimensional. - The orthonormal set is a subset of the vector space. But each assumption should be one line. So perhaps: Assumption: The vector space is an inner product space, The vector space is complete (Hilbert space), The vector space is infinite-dimensional, The orthonormal set is a subset of the vector space. Problem: Prove that the orthonormal set cannot be a vector space basis (where a basis allows only finite linear combinations). Alternatively, maybe completeness is part of the problem's context but not an assumption. Wait, the original question says \"in an infinite dimension vector space\". The user is asking about general infinite-dimensional vector spaces. But the edit clarifies that Knapp is referring to complete spaces. So to be precise, the problem is in the context of a complete infinite-dimensional inner product space. Therefore, the assumptions should include that. So each assumption line by line: - The vector space is an infinite-dimensional inner product space. - The vector space is complete (i.e., a Hilbert space). - The orthonormal set is a subset of the vector space. - A vector space basis (Hamel basis) allows only finite linear combinations. But the last one is a definition, not an assumption. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like modifying the problem. Maybe the user's example is not correct, but according to the instructions, we need to filter the problem and structure it. So perhaps in this case, the key assumptions from the problem are: - The vector space is infinite-dimensional. - It is a complete inner product space (Hilbert space). - We are considering an orthonormal set in this space. Then, the problem is to prove that such an orthonormal set cannot be a vector space basis (Hamel basis). So structuring it as: Assumption: The vector space is infinite-dimensional, The vector space is a complete inner product space (Hilbert space), The orthonormal set is a subset of the vector space. Problem: Prove that the orthonormal set cannot be a vector space basis (where a vector space basis requires finite linear combinations). But the original question didn't mention completeness, but the edit says Knapp is referring to complete spaces. So to be accurate, the problem's context includes completeness. Therefore, including completeness as an assumption. Also, the problem's title is about infinite-dimensional vector spaces. So the main assumptions are the space is infinite-dimensional, Hilbert, and the set is orthonormal. Therefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and the problem statement. So the final answer would be: ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT### Assumption: The vector space is infinite-dimensional, The vector space is a complete inner product space (Hilbert space), The orthonormal set is a subset of the vector space. Problem: Prove that the orthonormal set cannot be a vector space basis (where every vector is a finite linear combination of basis elements). ###",
