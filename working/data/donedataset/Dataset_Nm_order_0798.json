    "Content": "How can one prove that the Fourier transform of $\\log |x|$ is \n$$-\\pi \\mathrm{pf} \\frac{1}{|\\xi|} +C \\delta,$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{pf}\\frac{1}{|x|} = D(\\mathrm{sign}(x)\\log|x|)$ (in the sense of distributions) and how can I compute the constant $C$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will start from the well-known expression (see here ) for the Euler-Mescheroni constant $\\gamma$: $$\\gamma=\\int_0^1\\frac{1-\\cos t}{t}dt-\\int_{1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos t}{t}dt$$\nNow, if for $ x>0$ we consider\n$$F(x)=\\int_0^x\\frac{1-\\cos t}{t}dt-\\int_{x}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos t}{t}dt$$\nThen we conclude from $ F(1)=\\gamma$ and $F'(x)=1/x$ that\n$$\\eqalign{\\gamma+\\ln x&=\n\\int_0^x\\frac{1-\\cos t}{t}dt-\\int_{x}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos t}{t}dt\\cr\n&=\\int_0^1\\frac{1-\\cos(xt)}{t}dt-\\int_{1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos (xt)}{t}dt\n}$$\nAnd since the right side of the above formula is even we conclude that\n$$\n\\gamma+\\ln|x|=\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]}(t)-\\cos(xt)}{t}dt\\tag1\n$$\nFor every nonzero $x$. Let the regular distribution assosiated with the function $x\\mapsto \\gamma+\\ln|x|$  be denoted by $T$. What is the action of $T$ on some test function $\\phi$? Indeed, if $\\phi$ is a function from $\\mathcal{S}$ then using $(1)$ we see that\n$$\\eqalign{\\langle T,\\phi\\rangle\n&=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\gamma+\\ln|x|)\\phi(x)dx\\cr\n&=\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{2\\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]}(t)\\hat{\\phi}(0)-\\hat{\\phi}(t)-\\hat{\\phi}(-t)}{2t}dt\\cr\n&=\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{2\\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]}(t)\\hat{\\phi}(0)-\\hat{\\phi}(t)-\\check{\\hat{\\phi}}(t)}{2t}dt\\tag2\n}$$\nIndeed, since\n$\\hat{\\phi}(t)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\phi(x)e^{-ixt}dx$ we see easily that\n$$\\hat{\\phi}(0)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\phi(x)dx\\quad\\hbox{and}\\quad\n\\hat{\\phi}(t)+\\hat{\\phi}(-t)=2\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\phi(x)\\cos(xt)dx$$\nThus, applying (2) to $\\hat {\\phi}$ and noting that $\\hat{\\hat{\\phi}}=2\\pi\\check{\\phi}$ we conclude that\n$$\\eqalign{\\langle T,\\hat{\\phi}\\rangle\n&=2\\pi\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{2\\mathbb{I}_{[0,1]}(t)\\phi(0)-\\phi(t)-\\phi(-t)}{2t}dt\\cr\n&=\\pi\\int_0^1\\frac{2\\phi(0)-\\phi(t)-\\phi(-t)}{t}dt-\\pi\n\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{\\phi(t)+\\phi(-t)}{t}dt\\cr\n&=\\pi\\int_{0}^\\infty (\\ln t)(\\phi'(t)-\\phi'(-t))dt\\qquad\\hbox{(integration by parts)}\\cr\n&=\\pi\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}{\\rm sign}(t)\\ln|t|\\phi'(t)dt\\cr\n&=-\\pi\\langle{\\rm pf}\\frac{1}{|x|},\\phi\\rangle\n}$$\nSo, $\\hat{T}=-\\pi\\,{\\rm pf}\\frac{1}{|x|}$. But $$\\widehat{(\\gamma+\\ln|x|)}=2\\pi\\gamma\\delta+\\widehat{\\ln|x|}$$\nThus\n$$\\widehat{\\ln|x|}=-\\pi\\,{\\rm pf}\\frac{1}{|x|}-2\\pi\\gamma\\delta$$\nWhich is the desired conclusion.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and format it with Assumptions and Problem sections.\n\nLooking at the example provided: The original problem had an expression involving divisibility by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Or perhaps the user intended to modify the problem? Hmm, maybe the example was hypothetical. Anyway, moving on.\n\nNow, the current problem is about calculating the Fourier transform of log|x|, resulting in a distribution involving a pseudofunction and a delta term, and computing the constant C. The user provided the question from Math Stack Exchange.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the question and list the assumptions. The problem is to prove that the Fourier transform of log|x| is -π pf(1/|ξ|) + Cδ, and compute C. The question mentions that pf(1/|x|) is defined as the derivative of sign(x) log|x| in the sense of distributions.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be related to the definitions and properties used. Let's see:\n\n1. The Fourier transform is considered in the sense of distributions.\n2. The pseudofunction pf(1/|x|) is defined as the distributional derivative of sign(x) log|x|.\n3. The problem involves the Fourier transform of log|x|.\n\nWait, the original question says \"where pf(1/|x|) = D(sign(x) log|x|)\" (D being derivative). So that's part of the given definition. So in the assumptions, we need to list each condition. The key points here are:\n\n- The Fourier transform is in the sense of distributions.\n- The distribution pf(1/|ξ|) is defined as the derivative of sign(ξ) log|ξ|.\n- The problem involves computing the Fourier transform of log|x| and finding the constant C in the expression.\n\nBut the original problem is asking both to prove the form of the Fourier transform and to compute C. So the assumptions would include the definitions needed for the problem.\n\nSo each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Fourier transform is considered in the sense of distributions.\n- The pseudofunction $\\mathrm{pf}\\frac{1}{|x|}$ is defined as the distributional derivative $D(\\mathrm{sign}(x)\\log|x|)$.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions computing C. Do we need any assumptions about C? The problem doesn't state any, but the user is asking how to compute it. So perhaps the assumptions are only the definitions given.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Fourier transform is taken in the sense of distributions,\n$\\mathrm{pf}\\frac{1}{|x|}$ is defined as the distributional derivative $D(\\mathrm{sign}(x)\\log|x|)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Fourier transform of $\\log |x|$ is $$-\\pi \\mathrm{pf} \\frac{1}{|\\xi|} +C \\delta,$$ and compute the constant $C$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the assumptions are more about the context (distributions) and definitions (pf). So each line in the assumption should be one property or condition applied to one object. So splitting the first assumption into two parts: maybe \"The Fourier transform is considered in the sense of distributions.\" and \"The pseudofunction $\\mathrm{pf}\\frac{1}{|x|}$ is defined as $D(\\mathrm{sign}(x)\\log|x|)$ (distributional derivative).\" So each is a separate line.\n\nI think that's correct. So the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe Fourier transform is considered in the sense of distributions,\nThe pseudofunction $\\mathrm{pf}\\frac{1}{|x|}$ is defined as the distributional derivative $D(\\mathrm{sign}(x)\\log|x|)$.\nProblem: \nProve that the Fourier transform of $\\log |x| $ is \n$$-\\pi \\mathrm{pf} \\frac{1}{|\\xi|} +C \\delta,$$ \nand compute the constant $C$.\n###",
