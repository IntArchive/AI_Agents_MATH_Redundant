    "Content": "Define the following identities: $$\n\\phi_{n}:=\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\coth(nx^{-1})-xn^{-1}}{n(1+x^{2})^{2}}\\;dx \\qquad\n\\text{and}\\qquad \n\\Phi_{n}:=\\frac{\\cos(n\\pi)}{n}\n$$ $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ . I want to show that : $$\n\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\prod_{j=2}^{m}(1+\\phi_{n})^{ nk^{-j}\\Phi_{j}}=e^{\\gamma}\n$$ Where $\\gamma$ is the Euler - Mascheroni constant. What I did is that I used the linearity of integrals for $\\phi_{n}$ $$\n\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\phi_{n}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\coth\\left(\\frac{n}{x}\\right)}{n(1+x^{2})^{2}}\\;dx-\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{x}{n^{2}(1+x^{2})^{2}}\\;dx\n$$ The first one I define it as $I_{1}$ and the second one I define it as $I_{2}$ . Afterwards I defined: $$\n\\lambda_{n}(x):=\\frac{\\coth\\left(\\frac{n}{x}\\right)}{n(1+x^{2})^{2}}\\leq\\left|\\frac{1}{n(1+x^{2})^{2}}\\right|\\leq\\left|\\frac{1}{2n(1+x^{2})}\\right|=:V_{n}(x)\n$$ so that: $$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}V_{n}(x)\\;dx=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\pi}{4n}=0\n$$ Applying the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem I get: $$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\lambda_{n}(x)\\;dx=0\n\\tag 1$$ Now note that: $$\nI_{2}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{x}{n^{2}(1+x^{2})}\\;dx=\\frac{1}{2n^{2}}\\quad\\implies\\quad\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}I_{2}=0\n\\tag 2$$ $(1)$ and $(2)$ verify that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(1+\\phi_{n})^{n}\\leq\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(1+I_{1}-\\displaystyle I_{2})^{n}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}-\\frac{2}{n\\pi^{2}}\\right)^{n}=e$ Now all I have to evaluate $\\displaystyle\\exp\\left(\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{j=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\cos(j\\pi)}{k^{j}j}\\right)$ but this seems a bit confusing and misleading when I try it which is what I am stuck on.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The expression under the limit(s) is equal to ${a_n}^{b_m}$ , where $$a_n=(1+\\phi_n)^n,\\qquad b_m=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=2}^m\\frac{(-1)^j}{jk^j}.$$ Let $f(t)=\\coth(1/t)-t$ , then $n\\phi_n=(4/\\pi)\\int_0^\\infty(1+x^2)^{-2}f(x/n)\\,dx$ . Observe that $f$ is decreasing (to check, take the derivative and use $\\sinh z>z$ for $z>0$ ). Also, $f(0)=1$ if understood as the limit. Thus, $n\\mapsto f(x/n)$ is increasing for each fixed $x$ , so DCT (or even MCT) is applicable, and $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}n\\phi_n=(4/\\pi)\\int_0^\\infty(1+x^2)^{-2}f(0)\\,dx=1$ , hence $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}a_n=e$ as you know. As for $b_m$ , the corresponding $\\sum_{k=\\color{red}{2}}^\\infty\\sum_{j=2}^{\\color{red}{\\infty}}$ is absolutely convergent , so that we're free to interchange the summations, hence to take $m\\to\\infty$ directly under the outer sum: $$\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}b_m=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\sum_{j=2}^\\infty\\frac{(-1/k)^j}{j}=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\left[\\frac1k-\\log\\left(1+\\frac1k\\right)\\right]\\\\=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^n[\\ldots]=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac1k\\right)-\\log(n+1)\\right].$$ As $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}\\big(\\log(n+1)-\\log n\\big)=0$ , we then have $\\lim\\limits_{m\\to\\infty}b_m=\\gamma$ \"almost by definition\". Finally, the given limit is $e^\\gamma$ because $(a,b)\\mapsto a^b$ is continuous at $(e,\\gamma)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user defines two functions, φₙ and Φₙ. Then, they want to show that a certain double limit of a product involving these functions equals e^γ, where γ is Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nFirst, let's list the assumptions. The problem mentions that φₙ and Φₙ are defined for all natural numbers n. So each definition is an assumption. Also, the problem involves taking limits as m and n go to infinity, and the product over k from 1 to infinity and j from 2 to m. So, the structure of the product and the order of limits are important.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So for this problem:\n\n1. φₙ is defined as (4/π) times the integral from 0 to ∞ of [coth(n/x) - x/n] divided by [n(1+x²)²] dx.\n2. Φₙ is defined as cos(nπ)/n.\n3. For all n ∈ ℕ.\n4. The problem involves taking the limit as m approaches infinity, then the limit as n approaches infinity of the product over k from 1 to infinity and j from 2 to m of (1 + φₙ)^(n k^{-j} Φⱼ).\n\nWait, the original problem states the product over k from 1 to infinity and j from 2 to m. So each assumption needs to be a single line. Let me check:\n\n- The definitions of φₙ and Φₙ are separate.\n- The product is over k starting at 1 to infinity and j from 2 to m.\n- The limits are first m→∞, then n→∞.\n\nSo, translating into assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nφₙ is defined as (4/π) ∫₀^∞ [coth(n/x) - x/n] / [n(1 + x²)²] dx,\nΦₙ is defined as cos(nπ)/n,\nFor all n ∈ ℕ,\nThe expression involves a product over k from 1 to ∞,\nThe expression involves a product over j from 2 to m,\nThe limits are taken as m → ∞ first, then n → ∞.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking them down:\n\n1. φₙ is defined as (4/π) times the integral from 0 to ∞ of [coth(n/x) - x/n] / [n(1 + x²)²] dx.\n2. Φⱼ is defined as cos(jπ)/j for each j.\n3. The product is taken over all integers k from 1 to infinity.\n4. The product is taken over all integers j from 2 to m.\n5. The limit is taken as m approaches infinity.\n6. The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n7. The problem involves the expression (1 + φₙ)^{n k^{-j} Φⱼ}.\n\nWait, Φₙ was originally defined as cos(nπ)/n, but in the product, it's Φⱼ. So perhaps Φⱼ is cos(jπ)/j. The user wrote Φₙ as cos(nπ)/n, but in the product, the subscript is j. So maybe Φⱼ is defined as cos(jπ)/j for each j. The original problem says \"∀n∈ℕ\" after defining Φₙ, so Φₙ is cos(nπ)/n for each n. But in the product, the exponent is Φⱼ, which would be cos(jπ)/j. Therefore, Φⱼ is cos(jπ)/j for each j. So perhaps the original definition of Φₙ is actually for any integer n, so Φ_j is cos(jπ)/j. So that's a separate assumption.\n\nSo to clarify:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each n ∈ ℕ, φₙ is defined as (4/π) ∫₀^∞ [coth(n/x) - x/n] / [n(1 + x²)²] dx,\nFor each j ∈ ℕ, Φⱼ is defined as cos(jπ)/j,\nThe product over k from 1 to ∞,\nThe product over j from 2 to m,\nThe expression involves (1 + φₙ)^{n k^{-j} Φⱼ},\nLimits are taken as m → ∞ first, then n → ∞.\n\nBut need to split into single lines. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nφₙ is defined as $\\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\coth\\left(\\frac{n}{x}\\right) - \\frac{x}{n}}{n(1 + x^2)^2} dx$ for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\nΦⱼ is defined as $\\frac{\\cos(j\\pi)}{j}$ for each $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\nThe outer limit is $\\lim_{m \\to \\infty}$,\nThe inner limit is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}$,\nThe first product is over $k$ from $1$ to $\\infty$,\nThe second product is over $j$ from $2$ to $m$,\nThe exponent in each term is $n k^{-j} \\Phi_j$,\nThe base of each term is $1 + \\phi_n$,\nThe problem involves showing the expression equals $e^{\\gamma}$ where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"for all n ∈ ℕ\", so φₙ and Φₙ are defined for all natural numbers n. However, in the product, Φ is subscripted by j. Wait, the user defines Φₙ as cos(nπ)/n. Then in the product, they use Φ_j. So Φ_j would be cos(jπ)/j. So perhaps each Φ_j is defined as cos(jπ)/j. So the definitions are:\n\nφₙ is defined for each n as given,\nΦ_j is defined for each j as cos(jπ)/j.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wrote Φ_n with subscript n. So maybe Φ_j is just the same definition with j instead of n. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. For each natural number n, φₙ is defined as (4/π) times the integral given.\n2. For each natural number j, Φⱼ is defined as cos(jπ)/j.\n3. The product over k starts at 1 and goes to infinity.\n4. The product over j starts at 2 and goes to m.\n5. The limits are taken as m approaches infinity first, then n approaches infinity.\n6. The exponent in each term is n multiplied by k^{-j} multiplied by Φⱼ.\n7. The base of each exponent is (1 + φₙ).\n\nNow, the problem is to show that the entire expression equals e^γ.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\phi_{n} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\coth\\left(\\frac{n}{x}\\right) - \\frac{x}{n}}{n(1 + x^{2})^{2}} dx$,\nFor each $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\Phi_{j} = \\frac{\\cos(j\\pi)}{j}$,\nThe expression involves a product over $k$ from $1$ to $\\infty$,\nThe expression involves a product over $j$ from $2$ to $m$,\nThe expression involves terms of the form $(1 + \\phi_{n})^{n k^{-j} \\Phi_{j}}$,\nThe limit is taken as $m \\to \\infty$ first,\nThe limit is taken as $n \\to \\infty$ second.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\prod_{j=2}^{m}(1+\\phi_{n})^{ nk^{-j}\\Phi_{j}}=e^{\\gamma}.$$\n\nI think that's all the necessary assumptions.
