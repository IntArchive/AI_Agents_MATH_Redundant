    "Content": "This is an exercise from \"Contemporary Abstract Algebra\" I'm not sure how to solve. Exercise: Let $\\langle a\\rangle $ be a (cyclic) group of order $n$. Prove that the order of $a^k=\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n,k)}$. Direction: (1) Let $d=\\gcd(n,k)$, thus by the Euclidian algorithm we can find $X,Y\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $d=Xn+Yk$, thus, $a^d=a^{Xn+Yk}=a^{Xn}a^{Yk}=(a^n)^X(a^k)^Y=(a^k)^Y$. What to do from here? (2) We know that $d|n$, thus $\\langle a^{n/d} \\rangle$ is of order $d$ and $\\langle a^d \\rangle$ is of order $\\frac{n}{d}=\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n,k)}$. Is it mean that $d=k$? Where is my mistake?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You have two things to show. Namely that: $(a^k)^{n/\\gcd(n,k)}=e$ (where $e$ denotes the identity) and that $n/\\gcd(n,k)$ is the smallest positive power $p$ of $a^k$ such that $(a^k)^p=e$: For all $m>0$: $(a^k)^m=e \\implies n/\\gcd(n,k)\\leq m$ The first part is easy: $$\n(a^k)^{n/\\gcd(n,k)}=(a^n)^{k/\\gcd(n,k)}=e^{k/\\gcd(n,k)}=e\n$$ For the second part, let $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ be such that $(a^k)^m=a^{km}=e$. Since the order of $a$ is $n$, it follows that $n\\mid km$. Therefore we also have $$\n\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n,k)}\\mid \\frac{k}{\\gcd(n,k)}m\n$$ Now $\\gcd(n/\\gcd(n,k),k/\\gcd(n,k))=1$ (try to prove this), so it follows that $$\nn/\\gcd(n,k)\\mid m\n$$ Hence in particular $n/\\gcd(n,k)\\leq m$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about proving that the order of a^k in a cyclic group of order n is n divided by the greatest common divisor of n and k. The original question includes some attempts and confusion from the student. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the key assumptions. The main objects here are the cyclic group ⟨a⟩, the element a^k, and the integers n and k. The problem states that ⟨a⟩ has order n, so that's one assumption. The element in question is a^k, and we need to relate its order to n and k. The problem mentions gcd(n, k), so the relationship between n and k's gcd is essential here. \n\nLooking at the student's attempt, they mention letting d = gcd(n, k) and using the Euclidean algorithm. They also talk about the order of subgroups generated by a^{n/d} and a^d. However, the student seems confused about whether d equals k, which is a mistake. The key here is that the order of a^k is n/d, where d is gcd(n, k). \n\nSo the assumptions would be: the group ⟨a⟩ is cyclic, the order of a is n, and then the problem is to prove the order of a^k is n divided by gcd(n, k). The student's attempts with d = gcd(n, k) and the subgroups are part of their thought process but not assumptions of the problem itself.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So first, the group is cyclic, generated by a. Second, the order of a is n. The problem then is to show the order of a^k is n/gcd(n, k). \n\nThe student's confusion about whether d = k is part of their mistake, but that's not part of the problem's assumptions. The key assumptions are just the group structure and the orders involved. So the formatted problem should list those assumptions clearly.",
