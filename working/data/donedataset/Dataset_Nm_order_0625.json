    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the task is to show that the integral I(r) from 0 to 2π of (cos t - r)/(1 - 2r cos t + r²) dt equals zero for all r in [0,1). The user mentioned that numerical experiments suggest it's zero, and they want an analytical proof.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some integral techniques that might help here. The denominator 1 - 2r cos t + r² looks familiar. Wait, isn't that related to the Poisson kernel? The standard Poisson kernel is 1 - 2r cos t + r² in the denominator, but usually the numerator is different. The Poisson kernel integral is known and equals 2π for certain functions, but here the integrand is (cos t - r)/(denominator). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe substitution. Let me see. Let's consider substitution or maybe expanding the numerator. The integral is I(r) = ∫₀²π [cos t - r]/[1 - 2r cos t + r²] dt. Let me write the denominator as (1 + r²) - 2r cos t. So denominator is (1 - 2r cos t + r²). Maybe if I factor this, but it's similar to (1 - r e^{it})(1 - r e^{-it}) since expanding that gives 1 - r e^{it} - r e^{-it} + r² = 1 - 2r cos t + r². So that's correct. So the denominator factors as (1 - r e^{it})(1 - r e^{-it}).\n\nBut the numerator is cos t - r. Let's express cos t in terms of exponentials: cos t = (e^{it} + e^{-it})/2. So numerator becomes (e^{it} + e^{-it})/2 - r. Hmm, maybe that's useful. Alternatively, maybe split the integral into two parts: [cos t]/[denominator] dt minus r/[denominator] dt. So I(r) = ∫₀²π cos t / D dt - r ∫₀²π 1/D dt, where D is the denominator.\n\nNow, if I can compute these two integrals separately, maybe I can show their combination is zero. Let's think about ∫₀²π 1/(1 - 2r cos t + r²) dt. I remember that integral equals 2π/(1 - r²) when |r| < 1. Yes, that's a standard integral result. So ∫₀²π 1/D dt = 2π/(1 - r²). Then the second term is -r * 2π/(1 - r²).\n\nNow the first integral: ∫₀²π cos t / D dt. Hmm, how to compute this? Maybe differentiate the standard integral with respect to r? Let me recall that sometimes differentiating under the integral sign helps. Let's denote F(r) = ∫₀²π 1/(1 - 2r cos t + r²) dt = 2π/(1 - r²). Then maybe take derivative of F(r) with respect to r. Let's compute F'(r):\n\nF'(r) = d/dr [2π/(1 - r²)] = 2π * (2r)/(1 - r²)^2.\n\nBut also, differentiating under the integral sign, F'(r) = ∫₀²π [d/dr (1/(1 - 2r cos t + r²))] dt. Compute derivative inside:\n\nd/dr [1/(1 - 2r cos t + r²)] = [2 cos t - 2r] / (1 - 2r cos t + r²)^2.\n\nThus, F'(r) = ∫₀²π [2 cos t - 2r]/D² dt. But we know F'(r) is also 4π r / (1 - r²)^2. Therefore,\n\n∫₀²π [2 cos t - 2r]/D² dt = 4π r / (1 - r²)^2.\n\nBut this can be split into 2 ∫₀²π (cos t - r)/D² dt = 4π r/(1 - r²)^2, which implies ∫₀²π (cos t - r)/D² dt = 2π r/(1 - r²)^2.\n\nHmm, but our original integral I(r) is ∫ (cos t - r)/D dt, not divided by D squared. So this seems different. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, note that the integrand in I(r) is (cos t - r)/D. Let me write that as [cos t - r]/(1 - 2r cos t + r²). Let's see if we can relate this to a derivative. Since D = (1 - r e^{it})(1 - r e^{-it}), perhaps using complex analysis.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting z = e^{it}, so that dt = dz/(i z), and cos t = (z + z^{-1})/2. Then the integral becomes a contour integral around |z|=1. Let's try that.\n\nSubstituting z = e^{it}, t from 0 to 2π becomes z moving around the unit circle. Then, cos t = (z + 1/z)/2, and dt = dz/(i z). Let's rewrite the integral I(r):\n\nI(r) = ∫_{|z|=1} [ ( (z + 1/z)/2 - r ) / (1 - 2r*( (z + 1/z)/2 ) + r² ) ] * (dz/(i z)).\n\nSimplify denominator: 1 - r(z + 1/z) + r². Multiply numerator and denominator by z to eliminate 1/z:\n\nDenominator: 1 - r(z + 1/z) + r² = z^{-1}( z - r z² - r + r² z ). Wait, maybe better to multiply numerator and denominator by z:\n\nNumerator: [ (z + 1/z)/2 - r ] * z = (z² + 1)/2 - r z.\n\nDenominator: [1 - r(z + 1/z) + r² ] * z = z - r(z² + 1) + r² z.\n\nSo denominator becomes z - r z² - r + r² z = -r z² + (1 + r²) z - r.\n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\nI(r) = ∫_{|z|=1} [ (z² + 1)/2 - r z ] / [ -r z² + (1 + r²) z - r ] * (dz/(i z)).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can factor the denominator. Let's factor the quadratic in the denominator:\n\n-r z² + (1 + r²) z - r = -r z² + (1 + r²) z - r.\n\nLet me factor this quadratic equation. Let's write it as -r z² + (1 + r²) z - r = 0. Multiply both sides by -1: r z² - (1 + r²) z + r = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: z = [ (1 + r²) ± sqrt( (1 + r²)^2 - 4 r^2 ) ] / (2r )\n\nCompute discriminant: (1 + r²)^2 - 4 r² = 1 + 2r² + r⁴ - 4r² = 1 - 2r² + r⁴ = (1 - r²)^2.\n\nTherefore, roots are z = [ (1 + r²) ± (1 - r²) ] / (2r).\n\nCalculate:\n\nFirst root: [1 + r² + 1 - r²]/(2r) = 2/(2r) = 1/r.\n\nSecond root: [1 + r² -1 + r²]/(2r) = (2 r²)/(2r) = r.\n\nSo the quadratic factors as -r(z - 1/r)(z - r). But since we have a quadratic coefficient -r, so:\n\n-r(z - 1/r)(z - r) = -r(z - 1/r)(z - r) = -r [ z^2 - (r + 1/r) z + 1 ].\n\nBut wait, expanding (z - 1/r)(z - r) = z² - (r + 1/r) z + 1. Then multiplying by -r gives -r z² + (r² + 1) z - r, which matches the denominator. So denominator factors as -r(z - 1/r)(z - r).\n\nBut in the contour integral, we are integrating around |z|=1. The roots of the denominator are at z = r and z = 1/r. Since r is in [0,1), 1/r is outside the unit circle, so only z = r is inside the contour.\n\nTherefore, the integrand has a pole at z = r (since z=1/r is outside) and possibly at z=0 from the dz/(i z) term. Wait, let's check the integrand:\n\nThe integrand after substitution is:\n\n[ (z² +1)/2 - r z ] / [ -r(z - 1/r)(z - r) ] * 1/(i z).\n\nSimplify numerator: (z² + 1)/2 - r z = (z² - 2 r z +1)/2.\n\nWait, z² - 2 r z +1 is the numerator. So the integrand becomes:\n\n(z² - 2 r z +1)/2 divided by -r(z - 1/r)(z - r) times 1/(i z).\n\nSo, overall:\n\nIntegrand = (z² - 2 r z + 1) / [ -2 r (z - 1/r)(z - r) ] * 1/(i z) = (z² - 2 r z +1) / [ -2 r (z - 1/r)(z - r) i z ].\n\nBut note that z² - 2 r z +1 = (z - r)^2 - (r² -1). Hmm, maybe not helpful. Wait, let's see if z² - 2 r z +1 factors. Let's compute discriminant: (2r)^2 - 4*1*1 = 4r² -4 = 4(r² -1). Since r <1, this would have roots at z = [2r ± 2i sqrt(1 - r²)]/2 = r ± i sqrt(1 - r²). These are complex roots, so the numerator doesn't factor with real coefficients. But in any case, the integrand's numerator is z² - 2 r z +1, denominator is -2 r (z -1/r)(z - r) i z.\n\nSo the integrand has poles at z=0, z=r, and z=1/r (but z=1/r is outside the unit circle). So inside |z|=1, the poles are at z=0 and z=r.\n\nTherefore, by residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues at z=0 and z=r.\n\nCompute residues:\n\nFirst, residue at z=0. The integrand is:\n\n(z² - 2 r z +1) / [ -2 r (z -1/r)(z - r) i z ] = (z² -2 r z +1) / [ -2 r i z (z -1/r)(z - r) ].\n\nSo near z=0, we can expand the other terms. Let's write it as:\n\n[(z² -2 r z +1)] / [ -2 r i z ( -1/r )(z - r) ] since (z -1/r) ≈ -1/r when z is near 0.\n\nWait, let me compute the Laurent expansion around z=0. The integrand is:\n\nNumerator: z² -2 r z +1.\n\nDenominator: -2 r i z (z -1/r)(z - r).\n\nAt z=0, the term (z -1/r) is -1/r, and (z - r) is -r. So denominator ≈ -2 r i z (-1/r)(-r) ) = -2 r i z (1/r * r) )? Wait, (z -1/r)(z - r) ≈ (-1/r)(-r) = 1 when z=0.\n\nWait, no. Wait, (z -1/r) when z=0 is -1/r, and (z - r) is -r. So their product is (-1/r)(-r) = 1. So denominator ≈ -2 r i z * 1 = -2 r i z.\n\nTherefore, near z=0, the integrand is approximately (1 -2 r z + z²) / (-2 r i z ) ≈ [1 / (-2 r i z ) ] * (1 -2 r z + z²).\n\nSo the Laurent series around z=0 is (1/(-2 r i )) * (1/z -2 r + z + ... ). Therefore, the residue at z=0 is the coefficient of 1/z, which is 1/(-2 r i) * 1 = -1/(2 r i).\n\nWait, but let's compute it more carefully. The residue at z=0 is the coefficient of 1/z in the Laurent expansion. The integrand:\n\nNumerator: 1 - 2 r z + z².\n\nDenominator: -2 r i z (z -1/r)(z - r).\n\nAs z approaches 0, (z -1/r) approaches -1/r, (z - r) approaches -r. So denominator ≈ -2 r i z * (-1/r) * (-r) ) = -2 r i z * (1/r * r) ) = -2 r i z *1 = -2 r i z.\n\nTherefore, integrand ≈ (1 -2 r z + z²)/(-2 r i z) = [1/( -2 r i z ) ] * (1 -2 r z + z²).\n\nExpanding this: (1)/(-2 r i z ) - (2 r z)/(-2 r i z ) + (z²)/(-2 r i z ) = -1/(2 r i z ) + 1/i + (-z)/(2 r i ).\n\nSo the coefficient of 1/z is -1/(2 r i ). Therefore, residue at z=0 is -1/(2 r i ).\n\nNow compute residue at z=r. Since z=r is a simple pole, the residue is:\n\nlim_{z→r} (z - r) * [ (z² -2 r z +1) / ( -2 r i z (z -1/r)(z - r) ) ].\n\nSimplify: (z - r) cancels in numerator and denominator:\n\nResidue = (r² -2 r * r +1) / ( -2 r i r (r -1/r ) ).\n\nCompute numerator: r² - 2 r² +1 = 1 - r².\n\nDenominator: -2 r i r (r -1/r ) = -2 r² i ( (r² -1)/r ) = -2 r² i ( (r² -1)/r ) = -2 r i (r² -1).\n\nSo overall:\n\nResidue = (1 - r²) / [ -2 r i (r² -1) ) ] = (1 - r²) / [ -2 r i (-1)(1 - r²) ) ] = (1 - r²) / [ 2 r i (1 - r²) ) ] = 1/(2 r i ).\n\nTherefore, residue at z=r is 1/(2 r i ).\n\nSum of residues: (-1/(2 r i )) + (1/(2 r i )) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0. Therefore, I(r) = 0.\n\nHence, proven that the integral is zero for r ∈ [0,1).\n\nAlternatively, another approach without complex analysis. Let's see if there's a real method.\n\nNote that the integrand can be rewritten as [cos t - r]/[1 - 2r cos t + r²]. Let's consider substituting t → -t or t → 2π - t, since the integral is over a full period. However, cos t is even, so maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's observe that the integrand is an odd function around some point. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, note that the integrand might be the derivative of some function.\n\nWait, considering the denominator D = 1 - 2r cos t + r². Let's compute dD/dr = -2 cos t + 2r. Then notice that the numerator is cos t - r = (-1/2)(dD/dr - 2r + 2r) ? Wait, let's see:\n\nNumerator: cos t - r = [ (-1/2)(dD/dr - 2r) ].\n\nWait, dD/dr = -2 cos t + 2r. Then rearranged, - (dD/dr)/2 + r = cos t - r. So cos t - r = - (dD/dr)/2 + r - r = - (dD/dr)/2.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nFrom dD/dr = -2 cos t + 2r, solving for cos t:\n\ncos t = (2r - dD/dr)/2.\n\nTherefore, cos t - r = (2r - dD/dr)/2 - r = -dD/dr / 2 - r/2. Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, let's try to express the integrand as derivative of something. Suppose we have:\n\nd/dr [ something ] = [cos t - r]/D.\n\nAlternatively, notice that D = (1 - r e^{it})(1 - r e^{-it}), as before, so maybe integrating with respect to t over the period. Alternatively, think of integrating a complex function.\n\nAlternatively, another substitution. Let s = t - π. Then when t goes from 0 to 2π, s goes from -π to π. Then cos t = cos(s + π) = -cos s. But this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, think about expanding the integrand in Fourier series. Since the denominator is related to the Poisson kernel, perhaps the integral can be evaluated term by term.\n\nAlternatively, let's try integrating by parts. Let u = cos t - r, dv = dt/(1 - 2r cos t + r²). Then du = -sin t dt, and v is the integral of dv. But integrating dv would require integrating 1/D dt, which we know is 2π/(1 - r²). But that's over the entire interval. However, integrating by parts over 0 to 2π would involve evaluating uv from 0 to 2π minus ∫ v du. But uv would involve [ (cos t - r ) v ] from 0 to 2π. Since cos t is periodic, this term would cancel out. Then we have - ∫ v (-sin t) dt = ∫ v sin t dt. But v is the integral of dv, which is ∫ 1/D dt = 2π/(1 - r²). Wait, no, dv = 1/D dt, so v would be the antiderivative of 1/D, which isn't straightforward. This seems not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that the integral I(r) is the real part of some complex integral. Let's consider the integral of (e^{it} - r)/D dt. If we can compute that, maybe the real part would be I(r). Let's compute:\n\nLet J(r) = ∫₀²π (e^{it} - r)/D dt. Then Re(J(r)) = I(r).\n\nCompute J(r). Substitute z = e^{it}, dz = i e^{it} dt, so dt = dz/(i z). Then D = 1 - 2r cos t + r² = (1 - r z)(1 - r/z ). So denominator becomes (1 - r z)(1 - r/z ). Then:\n\nJ(r) = ∫_{|z|=1} (z - r)/[(1 - r z)(1 - r/z )] * dz/(i z).\n\nSimplify denominator: (1 - r z)(1 - r/z ) = (1 - r z)( (z - r)/z ) = (1 - r z)(z - r)/z.\n\nTherefore, J(r) = ∫_{|z|=1} (z - r) / [ (1 - r z)(z - r)/z ] * dz/(i z ) = ∫_{|z|=1} z / (1 - r z ) * dz/(i z ) = ∫_{|z|=1} 1/(1 - r z ) * dz/i.\n\nSo J(r) = (1/i ) ∫_{|z|=1} 1/(1 - r z ) dz.\n\nBut 1/(1 - r z ) has a pole at z = 1/(r ), which is outside the unit circle since r <1. Therefore, by Cauchy's integral theorem, the integral is zero. Hence, J(r) = 0. Therefore, Re(J(r)) = I(r) = 0.\n\nWow, that's much simpler! So using complex analysis, the integral J(r) which includes I(r) as its real part is zero, hence I(r)=0.\n\nTherefore, the analytical proof shows that I(r) =0 for all r in [0,1).",
