    "Content": "I was trying to work out a problem I found online. Here is the problem statement: Let $f(x)$ be continuously differentiable on $(0, \\infty)$ and suppose $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = 0$. Prove that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{x} = 0$. (source: http://www.math.vt.edu/people/plinnell/Vtregional/E79/index.html ) The first idea that came to my mind was to show that for all $\\epsilon > 0$, we have $|f(x)| < \\epsilon|x|$ for sufficiently large $x$. (And I believe I could do this using the fact that $f'(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$.) However, I was wondering if there was a different (and nicer or cleverer) way. Here's an idea I had in mind: If $f$ is bounded, then $\\frac{f(x)}{x}$ clearly goes to zero. If $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$ is either $+\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, then we can apply l'Hôpital's rule (to get $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f'(x)}{1} = 0$). However, I'm not sure what I could do in the remaining case (when $f$ is unbounded but oscillates like crazy). Is there a way to finish the proof from here? Also, are there other ways of proving the given statement?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is an immediate consequence of L'Hopital's rule. For example, below is said L'Hospital's rule, from Rudin's $ $ Principles of Mathematical Analysis, $ $ 1976. Note that it requires only that the denominator $\\to\\infty,\\:$ not also the numerator. For more see the Monthly papers cited here. Remark $ $ L'Hospital's rule (LHR) is essentially a form of the Mean value Theorem (MVT) repacked into a form convenient for limit calculations. One can of course \"unpackage\" the MVT and apply it directly without any mention of LHR.  It's worth emphasizing that doing so does not really avoid L'Hopital's Rule (LHR) since it is precisely the proof of LHR, only specialized to a specfic function. Further, the proof of most special cases isn't much simpler than the proof of the general case of LHR. The raison d'être of the LHR abstraction is that it encapulates such applications of the Mean Value Theorem into a conveniently applicable form, so that one can easily reuse the proof by simply invoking the rule by name, not by value, i.e. not by repeating the whole proof (\"inlining\" it) every time one applies it!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the relevant assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe title of the question is: \"How to show that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = 0$ implies $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{x} = 0$?\" \n\nIn the question body, the user states: Let $f(x)$ be continuously differentiable on $(0, \\infty)$ and suppose $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = 0$. Prove that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{x} = 0$.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that the limit of f(x)/x as x approaches infinity is 0, given that f is continuously differentiable on (0, ∞) and the limit of f’(x) is 0 as x approaches infinity.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst assumption: The function $f$ is continuously differentiable on the interval $(0, \\infty)$. This is about the differentiability of f on the domain given.\n\nSecond assumption: The limit of the derivative of $f$ as $x$ approaches infinity is 0. That is, $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = 0$. This is a separate condition on the derivative.\n\nThe problem statement then is to prove that the limit of f(x)/x as x approaches infinity is 0.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The original problem mentions \"continuously differentiable on $(0, \\infty)$\" and the limit of f’(x). The user in their question also discusses cases where f is bounded or unbounded, but those are part of their thought process, not part of the problem's assumptions. The core assumptions are the differentiability condition and the limit of the derivative.\n\nSo, the formatted assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is continuously differentiable on $(0, \\infty)$,\n$\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(x)}{x} = 0$.\n\nI should check if there's any other condition mentioned. The problem says \"Let $f(x)$ be continuously differentiable on $(0, \\infty)$\", so that's the first assumption. Then \"suppose $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = 0$\" is the second assumption. The problem is to prove the limit of f(x)/x is 0. \n\nYes, that's all. The user's thoughts about L’Hospital’s rule and cases where f is bounded or not are part of their exploration but not part of the problem’s given conditions. So the assumptions are correctly captured.",
