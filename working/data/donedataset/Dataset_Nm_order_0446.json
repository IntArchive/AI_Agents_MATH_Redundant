    "Content": "Consider the partial sum of the divergent Harmonic series $H_n = \\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{n}\\frac{1}{k}$. I recently saw a question which required finding out the asymptotic bounds of $H_n$. Now, I could not find any bound closer than $O(n)$. So I looked up the series and found this Wikipedia article which says that $H_n - \\ln n$ approaches a constant (the Euler–Mascheroni constant ). This clearly shows that $H_n = \\Theta(\\log n)$. However, considering the question was in an beginners undergraduate algorithms course in CS, I was wondering if there is a simpler proof of this? Is there some clever proof requiring elementary mathematics to show $H_n = \\Theta(\\log n)$? PS: This is not homework in the sense that it is not my homework, and the actual question does not ask for a proof, but rather asks a lot of functions to be arranged asymptotically.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$$ f(n) = H_n - \\log n $$ starts a little high ($f(1) = 1$) and (strictly) decreases.\n$$ g(n) = H_n - \\log (n+1) $$ starts a little low ($g(1) = 1 - \\log 2$) and (strictly) increases.\nAs $$  (f(n) - g(n)) \\rightarrow 0 $$ they share a common limit.\nThe common limit is called $\\gamma,$ with\n$$  \\gamma \\approx 0.5772156649\\ldots $$\nSo\n$$  H_n > \\gamma + \\log n,

additional material is  my answer to a question that was deleted by the person who posted it, https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1432576/how-can-i-get-alpha-and-beta-numerically-euler-constant Now that you know that the thing converges to a constant, you might want to know how to calculate that constant quickly to several decimal places. Of course, it is in many books and websites. Anyway, the sequence below obviously has the same limit, but the adjustments make it converge to $\\gamma$ quickly. Alternatively, you can take $\\gamma$ to $50$ digits and use this for very good accuracy in approximating $H_n.$ From two pages in Abramowitz and Stegun on the digamma function, especially formula 6.3.18 on page 259, which leads to\n$$ \\scriptsize H_n = \\gamma + \\log n + \\frac{1}{2n} - \\frac{1}{12 n^2}  + \\frac{1}{120 n^4}  - \\frac{1}{252 n^6}   + \\frac{1}{240 n^8}   - \\frac{1}{132 n^{10}}    + \\frac{691}{32760 n^{12}}  - \\frac{1}{12 n^{14}}    + \\frac{3617}{8160 n^{16}}   + O ( n^{-18})   $$ //  n = 5 :    0.57721566490.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's specified structure. Let me start by understanding the original problem and the example provided.\n\nThe user provided an example where they extracted assumptions and restructured the problem. In the example, they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then, they presented the problem statement concisely.\n\nNow, looking at the current problem from Math Stack Exchange:\n\nTitle: Simple proof of showing the Harmonic number $H_n = \\Theta (\\log n)$\n\nQuestion: The user is asking for a simpler proof that the Harmonic number $H_n$ is Theta of log n, which means it's asymptotically bounded both above and below by log n. The original context mentions that the question comes from a beginner's algorithms course, so they want a proof using elementary mathematics rather than the approach involving the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem is about the Harmonic number defined as the partial sum of the divergent harmonic series: $H_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}$. The task is to show that $H_n = \\Theta(\\log n)$.\n\nWhat are the assumptions here? Let's see:\n\n1. The harmonic number $H_n$ is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of 1/k.\n2. The problem requires proving asymptotic bounds, specifically that $H_n$ is Theta of log n.\n3. The context is a beginner's course, so the proof should use elementary methods, not relying on the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were properties or conditions applied to objects in the problem. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the main assumptions are the definition of $H_n$ and perhaps that n is a positive integer. However, the user's example included specific conditions like divisibility. In this case, the problem is more about the properties of $H_n$ rather than conditions on n. The key elements are that $H_n$ is defined as the sum of reciprocals up to n, and the problem is to show its asymptotic behavior. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variables involved. So perhaps here, the main assumption is the definition of $H_n$. The problem then is to prove the asymptotic bound.\n\nBut the user's instructions say each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: $H_n$ is defined as $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $H_n = \\Theta(\\log n)$.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions that it's for a beginner's course and asks for a simpler proof using elementary mathematics. Should that be part of the assumptions? The example didn't include the context of the course as an assumption. The example only included mathematical conditions. So maybe the assumptions here are purely mathematical, not about the course context. Therefore, the main assumption is the definition of $H_n$, and the problem is to prove the asymptotic bound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an implicit assumption that n is a positive integer. But in the example, they specified n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, n is an integer (since it's the upper limit of the sum), so perhaps that's another assumption. Let me check.\n\nIn the problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"Consider the partial sum of the divergent Harmonic series $H_n = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n}\\frac{1}{k}$.\"\n\nSo here, n is the upper index of the sum, which is a positive integer. Therefore, one assumption is that n is a positive integer. The other assumption is the definition of $H_n$ as that sum.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- $n$ is a positive integer.\n- $H_n$ is defined as $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}$.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that $H_n = \\Theta(\\log n)$.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were listed as two separate lines, each addressing one property. So I should split them into separate points.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is a positive integer,\n$H_n$ is defined as $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $H_n = \\Theta(\\log n)$.\n\nThat seems correct. The original question does mention that this is for an undergraduate algorithms course, but that's part of the context, not the mathematical assumptions. The example provided by the user also didn't include the course context in the assumptions. Therefore, sticking to the mathematical conditions and definitions as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be as above.",
