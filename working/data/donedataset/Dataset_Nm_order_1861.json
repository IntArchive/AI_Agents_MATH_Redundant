    "Content": "It recently came to my mind, how to prove that the factorial grows faster than the exponential, or that the linear grows faster than the logarithmic, etc... I thought about writing:\n$$\na(n) = \\frac{k^n}{n!} = \\frac{ k \\times k \\times \\dots \\times k}{1\\times 2\\times\\dots\\times n} = \\frac k1 \\times \\frac k2 \\times \\dots \\times \\frac kn = \\frac k1 \\times \\frac k2 \\times \\dots \\times \\frac kk \\times \\frac k{k+1} \\times \\dots \\times \\frac kn\n$$\nIt's obvious that after k/k, every factor is smaller than 1, and by increasing n, k/n gets closer to 0, like if we had $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (k/n) = 0$, for any constant $k$. But, I think this is not a clear proof... so any hint is accepted.\nThank you for consideration.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you know that this limit exists, you have \n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{k^n}{n!} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{k^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac k{n+1} \\frac{k^n}{n!} = \\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac k{n+1} \\right) \\left( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac {k^n}{n!} \\right) = 0. \n$$\nCan you think of a short way to show the limit exists? (You need existence to justify my factoring of the limits at the end. If you don't have that then there's no reason for equality to hold.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the limit of k^n divided by n factorial as n approaches infinity is zero. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some related limits and theorems. I know that factorials grow faster than exponential functions, but how to formalize that? Maybe using the ratio test idea from series convergence. For the ratio test, if the limit of a_{n+1}/a_n is less than 1, the series converges. Here, if we consider the sequence a_n = k^n / n!, then the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n would be k/(n+1). As n approaches infinity, this ratio goes to zero, which is less than 1. So the series sum a_n converges, which implies that a_n must approach zero. That could be a way to prove it.\n\nBut the user mentioned expanding the product into terms up to k/k and then terms after that. So maybe splitting the product into two parts: the first k terms and the remaining terms. For example, write a(n) as (k/1 * k/2 * ... * k/k) * (k/(k+1) * ... * k/n). The first part is a constant (since k is fixed), and the second part is a product of terms each less than 1. Then as n increases, the second part becomes a product of more terms each less than 1, which might tend to zero. But how to make that rigorous?\n\nAlternatively, using Stirling's approximation for n! which is approximately n^n e^{-n} sqrt(2 pi n). Then k^n / n! ≈ k^n / (n^n e^{-n} sqrt(n)) ) = (e k / n)^n / sqrt(n). As n grows, (e k /n)^n tends to zero because (e k /n) tends to zero and raised to the power n. But maybe this is more advanced than needed.\n\nThe original question seems to want an elementary approach. The user mentions that after the k-th term, each factor is less than 1, and as n increases, those factors get closer to 0. But how to formalize that multiplying infinitely many terms less than 1 would approach zero. However, just having terms less than 1 isn't enough; for example, the product of (1 - 1/n) doesn't go to zero. But in this case, the terms after k are k/(k+1), k/(k+2), ..., k/n. So each term is at most k/(k+m) where m starts at 1 and goes to infinity. For fixed k, as m increases, k/(k+m) approaches 0. But the number of terms increases as n increases. So maybe bounding the product.\n\nWait, after k terms, for n > 2k, perhaps. Let's split the product when n > 2k. Then, from k+1 to n, each term k/m <= k/(k+1) < 1. The number of terms is n - k. But even that might not give a clear bound. Alternatively, note that after some point, say m > 2k, then k/m <= 1/2. So for n > 2k, the product from m=2k+1 to n of k/m <= (1/2)^{n - 2k}. Then the entire product would be (a constant up to 2k) multiplied by (1/2)^{n - 2k}, which tends to zero as n approaches infinity. That seems like a possible approach.\n\nBut to formalize this, let's consider that for n > k, the terms from k+1 to n are all less than or equal to k/(k+1). But that term is a constant less than 1, so multiplying it n - k times would give (k/(k+1))^{n -k}. But since k is fixed, (k/(k+1))^{n -k} tends to zero as n approaches infinity. However, the product also includes terms from 1 to k, which is a constant. So the entire product is C * (k/(k+1))^{n -k} which tends to zero.\n\nAlternatively, using the squeeze theorem. Since each term after k is less than 1, the entire product after k is less than (k/(k+1))^{n -k}. But maybe a better bound. Let's take n ≥ 2k. Then, in the product from m=1 to n, group the terms as (product from 1 to k) * (product from k+1 to 2k) * (product from 2k+1 to n). The product from 1 to k is a constant. The product from k+1 to 2k is (k/(k+1)) * ... * (k/(2k))). That's k terms each at most k/(k+1), so the product is ≤ (k/(k+1))^k. Then the product from 2k+1 to n is terms each ≤ k/(2k+1) ≤ 1/2. So that part is ≤ (1/2)^{n - 2k}. So overall, a(n) ≤ C * (k/(k+1))^k * (1/2)^{n - 2k}. As n → ∞, this bound goes to zero, so by squeeze theorem, a(n) → 0.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way. Using the ratio test idea: Consider the ratio a(n+1)/a(n) = k/(n+1). As n becomes large, this ratio becomes less than 1/2, say, for n > 2k. Then, after some index N, each term is less than half the previous term. Therefore, the sequence is eventually dominated by a geometric series with ratio 1/2, which converges to zero. So that's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the definition of the limit. For any ε > 0, we need to find N such that for all n > N, |k^n /n!| < ε. Since k is fixed, we can use the fact that n! grows faster than any exponential. To make this precise, perhaps fix N such that for n > N, k/n < 1/2, then k^n /n! < C*(1/2)^{n - N}, which can be made smaller than ε.\n\nIn any case, the problem is to prove that the limit is zero for any constant k. The assumptions are that n is a positive integer approaching infinity, and k is a constant. The problem statement doesn't specify any particular conditions on k except that it's a constant, so we can assume k is a positive real number. However, even if k is negative, since we're raising it to the nth power, but divided by n! which is positive, so the absolute value would be |k|^n /n!, so the limit would still be zero. So maybe the problem implicitly assumes k is a real constant, but the user didn't specify. But in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"for any constant k\", so the assumptions should reflect that k is a real constant and n approaches infinity.",
