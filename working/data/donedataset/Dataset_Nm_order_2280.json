    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is an alternative approach which is too long for comment. If we put $q = e^{-\\pi}$ then the desired sum is $$-\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{3}}{q^{-2n} - 1} = -\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{3}q^{2n}}{1 - q^{2n}} = \\frac{1 - Q(q^{2})}{240}$$ and we know that $$Q(q^{2}) = \\left(\\frac{2K}{\\pi}\\right)^{4}(1 - k^{2} + k^{4})$$ For $q = e^{-\\pi}$ we have $k = 1/\\sqrt{2}$ so that $(1 - k^{2} + k^{4}) = 1 - 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4$ and $$K(k) = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2}$$ so that $$Q(q^{2}) = \\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{2K}{\\pi}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{3}{64\\pi^{6}}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{8}$$ and therefore the desired sum is equal to $$\\frac{64\\pi^{6} - 3\\Gamma(1/4)^{8}}{15360\\pi^{6}}$$ The expression for $Q(q^{2})$ in terms of $K, k$ is derived here . Using the same technique and expression for $R(q^{2})$ we can get the surprisingly simple and beautiful result $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{5}}{e^{2\\pi n} - 1} = \\frac{1}{504}$$ For the second sum mentioned in the question we let $$q = \\exp(-2\\pi\\log(\\pi/2)) = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^{2\\pi}$$ and then the desired sum is equal to $$S = -\\left(\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)^{3}\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{3}q^{n}}{1 + q^{n}} = -\\left(\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)^{3}\\cdot A$$ where the sum\n\\begin{align}\nA &= \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{3}q^{n}}{1 + q^{n}}\\notag\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}n^{3}q^{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + q^{n}} - \\frac{1}{1 - q^{n}} + \\frac{1}{1 - q^{n}}\\right)\\notag\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}n^{3}q^{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - q^{n}} - \\frac{2q^{n}}{1 - q^{2n}}\\right)\\notag\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{3}q^{n}}{1 - q^{n}} - 2\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{3}q^{2n}}{1 - q^{2n}}\\notag\\\\\n&= \\frac{Q(q) - 1}{240} - \\frac{Q(q^{2}) - 1}{120}\\notag\\\\\n&= \\frac{1 + Q(q) - 2Q(q^{2})}{240}\\notag\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{240} + \\frac{1}{240}\\left(\\frac{2K}{\\pi}\\right)^{4}(1 + 14k^{2} + k^{4} - 2 + 2k^{2} - 2k^{4})\\notag\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{240} - \\frac{1}{240}\\left(\\frac{2K}{\\pi}\\right)^{4}(1 - 16k^{2} + k^{4})\\notag\\\\\n\\end{align}\nand hence $$S = \\frac{1}{240}\\left(\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)^{3}\\left(\\frac{2K}{\\pi}\\right)^{4}(1 - 16k^{2} + k^{4}) - \\frac{1}{240}\\left(\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)^{3}$$ I doubt if it can be put into a closed form which is as simple as that for the previous sum.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem is then stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user is asking about evaluating two infinite sums using inverse Mellin transforms and mentions elliptic theta functions. The first sum is already given with a closed-form expression involving the q-polygamma function. The second sum is more complicated, with a long expression involving logarithms and another q-polygamma term.\n\nI need to filter out the unrelated information. The title mentions \"Evaluating ∑_{n=1}^∞ (n^3)/(e^{2πn}−1) using inverse Mellin transform,\" but the actual question in the body includes two different sums. The first one is similar to the title but has a negative sign. The user then provides another series involving elliptic theta functions and a complex expression. However, the problem seems to be asking for help in proving these sums using the mentioned methods.\n\nThe assumptions would need to list each condition. For the first sum, the series is from k=1 to infinity of -k^3/(e^{2πk} -1). The second sum is from k=1 to infinity of (k*(-log(π/2)))^3 / (e^{2π(k log(π/2))} +1). Each assumption should be a single condition. For example, the first assumption is about the first series, the second assumption is about the second series, and maybe the methods to be used (inverse Mellin transform, elliptic theta functions). But the example given in the problem only lists the objects and their properties, not the methods. The example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\".\n\nIn this case, the problem is to prove the closed-form expressions for those two sums. The assumptions would be the definitions of the sums. However, since each assumption should address one property of one object, maybe each sum is an assumption? Wait, no. The problem is to prove these sums, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed. The user mentions using inverse Mellin transform and elliptic theta function theory, but the example didn't include methods in assumptions. The example's assumptions were about the variables involved.\n\nWait, the original example had the problem being to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is presenting two sums and wants to prove their closed-form expressions. However, the problem as stated in the question is not clear. The user says \"I like to give another series it will interesting using elliptic theta function theory to prove it\" followed by the second sum. So the problem is to prove both of these sums? Or is the main problem the second sum?\n\nThe user starts by talking about the first sum, then says \"I like to give another series...\" which seems like the main focus. But the title is about the first sum. The question is a bit messy. The user also apologizes for the LaTeX, indicating possible typos.\n\nTo structure this, the assumptions would include the definitions of both series. Each series is an object, so each should be an assumption. Then the problem is to prove their closed-form expressions. But the example only lists the conditions on variables, not the series themselves. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the convergence of the series or the methods to be used. But the example didn't include that. The example's assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the variables are k, and the sums are over k. But the problem is to prove the closed-form expressions. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the sums. So each sum is an assumption? Wait, no. The problem is to prove the sum equals the given expression. So the problem statement is \"Prove that [sum] equals [expression]\".\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to evaluate the sums. So perhaps the assumptions are that the sums converge, or that certain conditions on the parameters hold. However, the user hasn't specified any conditions; they just present the sums and the expressions.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumption is that the sum is as defined. So for the first sum: sum_{k=1}^\\infty -k^3/(e^{2πk} -1). But the example shows that the assumption is about the variables involved. Maybe in this case, the problem is to evaluate the sums, so the assumptions are the definitions of the sums. But the example structured the assumption as properties of the variable. Since the variables here are k, which is a summation index (integer starting at 1), perhaps the assumption is that k is a positive integer. But that's inherent in the summation. The example didn't state that n is an integer in the assumption, but in the problem, the user had to include it because the original problem said \"for every integer n\".\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption included that n is an integer. Here, the problem is about sums over k from 1 to infinity, so k is a positive integer. But the example didn't list the summation index as an assumption. So maybe in this case, the assumptions would just be the definitions of the sums. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just as stated, and the assumptions are the given expressions. But the example's assumptions were separate from the problem statement. Let's re-examine the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. But that seems contradictory. Wait, no, looking back, the original example might have had a mistake. Wait, in the original example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's incorrect, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made an error in the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But this is conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which restricts n. That seems incorrect. Perhaps the example is wrong. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding. Wait, 91 is 7*13. Maybe the original problem actually required n to be divisible by 7? But the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So the example might have a mistake. But regardless, the user provided that example as a guide.\n\nIn any case, following the user's example, even if flawed, I need to structure the current problem similarly. The assumptions should list properties of the variables involved. In the current problem, the variables are k, which runs over positive integers, and other parameters like π and log(π/2). However, the problem is to evaluate the sums, so perhaps the assumptions are the expressions of the sums themselves. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, since the sums are defined with specific terms, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the sums. But each assumption should be a single property of one object.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the given expressions for the two sums. So the problem statement would be \"Prove that [sum1] equals [expression1] and [sum2] equals [expression2] using inverse Mellin transform and elliptic theta function theory.\" But the user mentions the first sum uses inverse Mellin and the second uses elliptic theta functions.\n\nSo, to structure it, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the two sums, and the problem is to prove their closed-form expressions. But each assumption should be a single property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -\\frac{k^3}{e^{2\\pi k} -1}$ is considered.\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(k \\left(-\\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)^3}{e^{2 \\pi  \\left(k \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)}+1}$ is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the first series equals the given closed-form expression using the inverse Mellin transform, and the second series equals its closed-form expression using elliptic theta function theory.\n\nBut the user's example formatted assumptions as conditions on the variables. Here, since the problem is about sums, maybe the assumptions are that the sums converge, but that's implicit. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are the methods to be used. However, the example didn't include methods in assumptions. This is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, given that the example's assumptions were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), maybe here the assumptions are that k is a positive integer, and other parameters like π and log(π/2) are constants. But the problem is to evaluate the sums, so the variables are summation indices, which are positive integers by default.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the expressions, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the definitions of the sums. But the example included assumptions, so perhaps we need to list the components. Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to list each series as an assumption, then state the problem as proving their closed-form expressions.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -\\frac{k^3}{e^{2\\pi k} -1}$ is considered.\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(k \\left(-\\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)^3}{e^{2 \\pi  \\left(k \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)}+1}$ is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the first series equals [given expression] using the inverse Mellin transform, and prove the second series equals [other expression] using elliptic theta function theory.\n\nBut the example had each assumption as a single line, addressing one property of one object. Here, each series is an object, so each is an assumption. However, the problem statement would then be to prove their closed forms. But the user's example had a problem statement that was a single statement. Here, there are two separate problems. But the user combined them into one question.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to evaluate both sums using the specified methods. Thus, the problem statement would be: \"Prove the closed-form expressions for the given series using the inverse Mellin transform and elliptic theta function theory, respectively.\"\n\nBut I need to adhere to the format. Given the example, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n$k$ is a positive integer,\n$\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ is a constant,\nThe inverse Mellin transform is applicable,\nElliptic theta function theory is applicable.\n\nBut that's adding methods as assumptions, which wasn't in the example. The example's assumptions were about the variable's properties.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are the definitions of the series. Each series is a separate assumption. But since each assumption should be a single line, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nConsider the series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -\\frac{k^3}{e^{2\\pi k} -1}$,\nConsider the series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(k \\left(-\\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)^3}{e^{2 \\pi  \\left(k \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)}+1}$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the first series equals [expression1] using the inverse Mellin transform and the second series equals [expression2] using elliptic theta function theory.\n\nBut the example didn't include the method in the problem statement, but in the original problem, the user mentions using those methods. So the problem should include the method.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the closed-form expressions, and the assumptions are the series definitions. But the example included variable properties. Given that the user's example included variable properties as assumptions, maybe here the variables are k, which are positive integers, and other constants like π and log(π/2) are given. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$k$ is a positive integer,\n$\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ is a constant.\n\nProblem: Prove the closed-form expressions for the two given series.\n\nBut the problem includes specific methods (inverse Mellin, elliptic theta). Should the problem statement include the methods? The original example didn't mention methods in the problem statement. The example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The methods weren't part of the problem statement. So maybe here, the problem statement is to prove the sums equal the given expressions, and the assumptions are about the variables.\n\nBut in this case, the sums are over k, which are positive integers. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$k$ is a positive integer,\n$\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ is a constant.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -\\frac{k^3}{e^{2\\pi k} -1} = \\frac{3840 \\pi^4 \\psi_{e^{2\\pi}}^{(1)}(1) + \\cdots}{23040 \\pi^6}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(k \\left(-\\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)^3}{e^{2\\pi \\left(k \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)} + 1} = \\text{[given expression]}\n$$\n\nBut the example's assumptions were specific to the problem's variables. In the current problem, the variables in the sums are k, which are positive integers, so that's inherent. The other terms involve constants like π and log(π/2), which are given. So maybe the assumptions are that those constants are as defined.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to evaluate the sums, the main assumptions are the definitions of the sums. But following the example, where assumptions were about the variable's properties, here it's unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to list the two series as separate assumptions and state the problem as proving their closed-form expressions. Each series is an assumption, so:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -\\frac{k^3}{e^{2\\pi k} -1}$ is considered,\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(k \\left(-\\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)^3}{e^{2 \\pi  \\left(k \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)}+1}$ is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the first series equals [expression1] and the second series equals [expression2].\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions as properties of variables, not the series themselves. However, given the complexity of the problem, and the user's instruction to filter unrelated information, maybe focus on the key elements.\n\nThe original question has two parts: the first sum involving inverse Mellin transform, and the second sum involving elliptic theta functions. The user wants to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nGiven the example, perhaps the assumptions are about the methods to be used. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inverse Mellin transform is applicable to the series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -\\frac{k^3}{e^{2\\pi k} -1}$,\nElliptic theta function theory is applicable to the series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(k \\left(-\\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)^3}{e^{2 \\pi  \\left(k \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)}+1}$.\n\nProblem: Prove the closed-form expressions for both series using the specified methods.\n\nBut again, the example didn't include methods in assumptions. The example's assumptions were about the variable. Given the confusion, and the user's example possibly having an error, it's safer to stick to the structure: list assumptions as conditions on the variables or objects involved, then state the problem.\n\nIn this case, the problem involves two sums. Each sum is an object. Therefore, the assumptions should be the definitions of each sum. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -\\frac{k^3}{e^{2\\pi k} -1}$ is considered,\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(k \\left(-\\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)^3}{e^{2 \\pi  \\left(k \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)}+1}$ is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the first series equals [expression1] and the second series equals [expression2].\n\nBut to fit the example's style, where assumptions were properties of n, here the assumptions are the existence of the series. However, the example might not be perfectly applicable here. Given the user's instruction to follow the example, even if the example had potential issues, proceed accordingly.\n\nAnother angle: the original problem in the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that might have been a mistake. But the user included it in the formatted problem. Perhaps the user wanted to extract conditions from the problem statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user presents two sums and their supposed closed forms. The problem is to prove those closed forms. The assumptions would be any conditions needed for the sums to converge or for the methods to apply. For example, convergence of the series, or conditions on the parameters. However, the user didn't specify any conditions, so maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the series definitions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list each series as an assumption, then the problem is to prove their closed forms. But each assumption should be a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -\\frac{k^3}{e^{2\\pi k} -1}$ is considered,\nThe series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(k \\left(-\\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)^3}{e^{2 \\pi  \\left(k \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)}+1}$ is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the first series equals [expression1] and the second series equals [expression2].\n\nBut the example's assumptions were properties (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are the series themselves. Perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, given that the user's example extracted \"n is an integer\" from the problem statement, here the assumptions could be that k is a positive integer, which is inherent in the summation. But in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" even though it was part of the original problem's statement.\n\nIn conclusion, following the example's approach, the assumptions would include any conditions on the variables. Here, the summation index k is a positive integer, which is part of the definition of the sum. However, since the example included \"n is an integer\" even though it was stated in the problem, perhaps here the assumptions should include \"k is a positive integer\" for each sum. But since there are two sums, each involving k, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nFor the first series, $k$ is a positive integer,\nFor the second series, $k$ is a positive integer,\n$\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ is a constant.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty -\\frac{k^3}{e^{2\\pi k} -1} = \\frac{3840 \\pi^4 \\psi_{e^{2\\pi}}^{(1)}(1) + \\cdots}{23040 \\pi^6}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\left(k \\left(-\\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)^3}{e^{2 \\pi  \\left(k \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right)\\right)}+1} = \\text{[given expression]}.\n$$\n\nBut the example didn't include constants in assumptions. This might be overcomplicating. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with structuring the problem as per the user's example, listing the series as assumptions and the problem to prove their closed forms.",
