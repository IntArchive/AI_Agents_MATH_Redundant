    "Content": "Can somebody explain to me a proof that $\\operatorname{SO}(n)$ is a maximal subgroup of $\\operatorname{SL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ meaning, that if you add one element to $\\operatorname{SO}(n)$ , you generate the whole $\\operatorname{SL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$ ?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "$n=2$ . A geometric proof: $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbf{R})$ acts on the hyperbolic plane as the full orientation-preserving isometry group with stabilizer $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ . We need to check this action is primitive. Indeed, let $R$ be an invariant equivalence relation, not reduced to equality. Since the action is transitive on pairs at given distance, there exists a subset $M$ of $\\mathbf{R}_{\\ge 0}$ , not reduced to $\\{0\\}$ , such that $R$ equals the set of pairs at distance in $M$ . Choose $r>0$ in $M$ . Since any two points $x,y$ in the hyperbolic plane can be joined by a discrete path $x=x_0,\\dots,x_n=y$ with $d(x_i,x_{i+1})=r$ , we deduce that $xRy$ . Hence $R$ is the indiscrete equivalence relation. Now consider $n\\ge 3$ . Let $H$ be a subgroup properly containing $\\mathrm{SO}(n)$ . Let $D$ be the set of diagonal determinant 1 matrices with positive entries. Let $D_H$ be the intersection $D\\cap H$ . It is enough to show that $D_H=D$ (indeed, by polar decomposition it is enough to check that every positive determinant 1 symmetric matrix belongs to $H$ , and using ortho-diagonalization, it is enough to check the latter for diagonal matrices). Moreover, again by the same polar decomposition argument, the assumption $H\\neq\\mathrm{SO}(n)$ implies that $D_H$ is not reduced to $\\{1\\}$ . Note that $D_H$ is stable under permutation of coordinates. Hence it contains some diagonal matrix $(t_1,t_2,t_3,\\dots)$ with $0<t_2<1<t_1$ . Hence it also contains the diagonal matrix $(t_2,t_1,t_3,\\dots,t_n)$ . Hence it contains the diagonal matrix $(u,u^{-1},1,\\dots,1)$ with $u=t_1/t_2>1$ . By the case $n=2$ applied to the $2\\times 2$ north-west block, it therefore contains all matrices $(v,v^{-1},1,\\dots,1)$ . Hence, it also contains all its conjugates by permutations of coordinates. Since any element $(u_1,\\dots,u_n)$ of $D$ (so $\\prod u_i=1$ ) is the product of the diagonal matrices $(1,\\dots,v_i,v_i^{-1},1,\\dots,1)$ for $i=1\\dots n-1$ with $v_i=u_1\\dots u_i$ , we deduce $D_H=D$ , which finishes the proof. Finally the most subtle case is $n=2$ . In this case one can try a more direct approch. Namely write $K=\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ . By assumption there is a non-trivial element $g$ in $D_H$ . I'd try to show that the map $K^3\\to\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbf{R})$ , mapping $(x,y,z)$ to $xgyg^{-1}z$ , has its differential of rank 3 somewhere. Indeed, if so, it implies that its image has non-empty interior in $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbf{R})$ , and hence $H$ has non-empty interior in $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbf{R})$ , so is an open subgroup, so equals $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbf{R})$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that SO(n) is a maximal subgroup of SL(n, R). The user wants the assumptions and problem statement clearly separated.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem is in the context of group theory, so the key objects here are the special orthogonal group SO(n) and the special linear group SL(n, R). The main condition is that SO(n) is a maximal subgroup of SL(n, R). \n\nLooking at the question, the user mentions that if you add one element to SO(n), you generate the entire SL(n, R). So the assumptions should include the definitions of the groups involved. Let me break them down:\n\n1. SL(n, R) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n2. SO(n) is the subgroup of SL(n, R) consisting of orthogonal matrices with determinant 1.\n3. The term \"maximal subgroup\" here means that there's no proper subgroup of SL(n, R) that properly contains SO(n).\n\nWait, but the original problem states that adding any element not in SO(n) generates the whole SL(n, R). So maybe another assumption is that we are considering adding an element from SL(n, R) but not in SO(n). However, since the problem is to prove maximality, maybe the assumptions are just the definitions. Let me check the example given by the user. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumptions are about the properties of the groups involved.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- SL(n, ℝ) is the special linear group of degree n over the real numbers.\n- SO(n) is the special orthogonal group of degree n.\n- A maximal subgroup is a proper subgroup not contained in any other proper subgroup.\n\nBut maybe more precise. The problem is about SO(n) being maximal in SL(n, ℝ). So the problem's context is within SL(n, ℝ), and SO(n) is a subgroup. The maximality here is in the abstract group sense, not necessarily Lie subgroups. The user mentions \"abstractly maximal,\" so perhaps the problem is about maximality as an abstract group, not considering the Lie group structure. However, the exact assumptions might need to be inferred.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions line by line:\n\n1. SL(n, ℝ) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n2. SO(n) is the subgroup of SL(n, ℝ) consisting of matrices Q such that Q^T Q = I (orthogonal matrices).\n3. A subgroup H of a group G is maximal if there is no subgroup K such that H < K < G.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that SO(n) is a maximal subgroup of SL(n, ℝ), i.e., adding any element of SL(n, ℝ) not in SO(n) to SO(n) generates the entire SL(n, ℝ).\n\nWait, but the original problem states: \"if you add one element to SO(n), you generate the whole SL(n, ℝ)\". So the problem is to show that SO(n) is maximal by demonstrating that any larger subgroup containing SO(n) and one more element is the entire SL(n, ℝ). Therefore, the assumptions should include the definitions necessary, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- SL(n, ℝ) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n- SO(n) is the subgroup of SL(n, ℝ) consisting of orthogonal matrices (Q^T Q = I).\n- A subgroup H of G is maximal if there is no proper subgroup K of G such that H is properly contained in K.\n\nProblem:\nProve that SO(n) is a maximal subgroup of SL(n, ℝ); that is, if any element of SL(n, ℝ) not in SO(n) is added to SO(n), the generated subgroup is the entire SL(n, ℝ).\n\nBut perhaps the user's example had only two assumptions. Maybe here, the key is to list the specific conditions. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is more about group theory. The original question mentions an inductive proof and the induction step. So maybe the assumptions include something about induction on n? However, the user hasn't provided specific details on the induction step. Since the problem is to structure the given question into assumptions and problem statement, I need to extract from the original question.\n\nOriginal question: \"Can somebody explain to me a proof that SO(n) is a maximal subgroup of SL(n,R) meaning, that if you add one element to SO(n), you generate the whole SL(n,R)? I am particularly interested in an inductive proof, and the induction step therein.\"\n\nSo the main problem is to prove that SO(n) is maximal in SL(n,R) in the sense that adding any element generates the whole group. The user is interested in an inductive proof. However, the assumptions would be the definitions and conditions necessary. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- SL(n, ℝ) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n- SO(n) is the subgroup of SL(n, ℝ) consisting of orthogonal matrices (Q^T Q = I_n).\n- Maximality is considered in the abstract group sense (not necessarily as Lie groups).\n- The proof approach uses induction on n.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking for the problem to be structured, so the assumptions are part of the problem statement. The original problem states that SO(n) is maximal, and the user wants to see the proof. The assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumption included a condition that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem but perhaps not explicitly stated. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the user added that as an assumption. Wait, that example might be a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n(3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 contradicts that. This suggests that there might be an error in the example. However, the user provided that example, so perhaps they intended to include assumptions that might not be explicit. Alternatively, maybe in the original problem, the divisibility by 91 requires that n is divisible by 7 and 13, but the user's example only lists n divisible by 7. Hmm, 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the problem actually requires that n is such that 5^n and 6^n satisfy certain congruences modulo 7 and 13. But maybe the example was not correctly structured. However, since the user provided that example as a guide, we need to follow their structure, even if the example has issues.\n\nIn this case, the user's example seems to have taken the original problem, which states \"for every integer n\", and then in the formatted problem, added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But this seems contradictory. Perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example is flawed. However, we need to proceed as per the user's instruction.\n\nSo, returning to the current problem: The original question is about proving SO(n) is maximal in SL(n,R), with a focus on an inductive proof. The assumptions would be the properties of the groups involved and perhaps the induction hypothesis. However, the problem is to structure the question, not the solution. So we need to extract the assumptions from the original question. The original question says \"SO(n) is an (abstractly) maximal subgroup of SL(n)\", and asks for a proof, particularly inductive.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. SO(n) is a subgroup of SL(n, ℝ).\n2. Maximality is considered in the abstract group sense (not necessarily topological).\n3. The proof should use induction on n.\n\nBut these might be part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. Wait, the user's example included assumptions from the problem statement. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect unless the problem had a hidden condition. However, since I have to follow the user's example, perhaps the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. But the original problem here doesn't state any conditions except that SO(n) is a subgroup of SL(n, R). So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. SL(n, ℝ) is the special linear group of degree n over ℝ.\n2. SO(n) is the special orthogonal group of degree n.\n3. A subgroup H of G is maximal if there is no subgroup K with H < K < G.\n\nProblem: Prove that SO(n) is a maximal subgroup of SL(n, ℝ), i.e., adding any element of SL(n, ℝ) not in SO(n) to SO(n) generates the entire SL(n, ℝ).\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions \"abstractly maximal\", perhaps that is part of the assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- SO(n) is considered as an abstract subgroup of SL(n, ℝ).\n\nProblem: Prove that SO(n) is a maximal subgroup of SL(n, ℝ) in the abstract group sense.\n\nBut the user's example extracted specific conditions. Given the ambiguity, but trying to follow the example structure, I'll proceed to list the key assumptions from the problem. Since the original problem is to prove that SO(n) is maximal in SL(n,R), the assumptions are the definitions of the groups and the notion of maximality. The problem is the statement to prove.",
