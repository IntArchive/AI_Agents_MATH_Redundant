    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $N$ be a set of measure zero. Then for every $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$ we can write $N \\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty B_k$ where each $B_k$ is a ball of radius $r_k$ and $\\sum_k \\mu B_k \\lt \\varepsilon$. But then by Lipschitz continuity $f(B_k)$ is contained in a ball of radius $L\\cdot r_k$ where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of $f$, and thus $\\mu^\\ast f(B_k) \\leq L^d \\mu B_k$ so that\n$$\n\\mu^\\ast f(N) \\leq L^d \\sum\\nolimits_k \\mu B_k \\lt L^d \\varepsilon.\n$$\nAs $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$ was arbitrary, we see that $f(N)$ must have zero outer measure and hence it is a null set.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about why a Lipschitz function maps measure zero sets to measure zero sets, especially extending the argument to unbounded domains. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions a Lipschitz function f from R^d to R^d. So, the first assumption is that f is Lipschitz. Then, the domain is R^d, which is unbounded. The problem also mentions measure zero sets, so the function is acting on these sets. \n\nWait, the example given by the user had assumptions each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the main objects are the function f and the measure zero sets. The key conditions are that f is Lipschitz and the domain is R^d (unbounded). The problem is to show that f maps measure zero sets to measure zero sets, even in the unbounded case. \n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption was a separate line. So here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf: R^d → R^d is a Lipschitz function,\nE is a measure zero subset of R^d,\nThe domain of f is unbounded (since R^d is unbounded).\n\nWait, but maybe the user wants each assumption to be specific. The function being Lipschitz is one assumption. The set E having measure zero is another. The domain being unbounded is another. But the original problem states that the domain is R^d, which is unbounded, so that's part of the problem's setup. The problem is asking about extending the argument from bounded to unbounded domains. So perhaps the key assumptions are that f is Lipschitz on R^d, and E is a measure zero set in R^d. The problem is to show f(E) has measure zero.\n\nBut the example included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be about the function and the set. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf: R^d → R^d is Lipschitz,\nE is a subset of R^d with Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(E) has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nBut the original question mentions that it's easy for bounded domains and asks about unbounded. So maybe the domain being unbounded is an assumption? Wait, but the function's domain is R^d, which is unbounded. So maybe the assumption is that the domain is R^d (unbounded), but the problem is to show that even in this case, f maps measure zero sets to measure zero. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf: R^d → R^d is a Lipschitz function,\nE is a Lebesgue measure zero subset of R^d.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(E) has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nBut the user's example included redundant assumptions (like n divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n). Wait, in the example, the user's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, looking back: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem changed it to assuming n is divisible by 7 and then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that seems like a mistake. But maybe the user made an error in the example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should not include that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the example was a bad example. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions as given.\n\nThe user's instruction says: \"Assumption: All the assumptions... applied to one object\". So in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The function f is Lipschitz from R^d to R^d.\n\n2. The set E is a measure zero subset of R^d.\n\n3. The domain of f is unbounded (since R^d is unbounded).\n\nBut perhaps the domain being unbounded is part of the problem's context, not an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to handle the case where the domain is unbounded, so the key is that the function is defined on an unbounded domain (R^d) and is Lipschitz. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nf: R^d → R^d is Lipschitz,\n\nE is a subset of R^d with Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that f(E) has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nBut the original question mentions that the user knows how to prove it for bounded domains but needs help extending to unbounded. So perhaps the problem is to handle the unbounded case, hence the assumption that the domain is R^d (unbounded). But in the problem statement, should that be part of the problem or the assumption?\n\nIn the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, but perhaps the example was a mistake. Regardless, following the instructions, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f: R^d → R^d is a Lipschitz function.\n\n- E is a subset of R^d with Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that f(E) has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants to highlight the domain being unbounded, maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f: R^d → R^d is a Lipschitz function.\n\n- The domain of f is unbounded.\n\n- E is a subset of R^d with Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that f(E) has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included both the object's property (n is integer) and a condition (n divisible by 7). So here, the domain being unbounded is a property of the domain. But the original problem's key issue is handling unbounded domains. So perhaps including the domain's unboundedness as an assumption is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, since R^d is the domain, which is inherently unbounded, maybe that's part of the problem's setup. Hmm. The user's example had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended to filter out redundant info. So in the current problem, the original question is about extending from bounded to unbounded domains. So the key assumption here is that the domain is unbounded (R^d). So structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n\nf: R^d → R^d is a Lipschitz function,\n\nE is a subset of R^d with Lebesgue measure zero,\n\nThe domain of f is unbounded.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that f(E) has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nBut maybe the third assumption is redundant because R^d is already unbounded. Alternatively, since the function's domain is R^d, which is unbounded, it's part of the function's definition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nf: R^d → R^d is a Lipschitz function,\n\nE is a subset of R^d with Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that f(E) has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nBut the original problem mentions that the user can prove it for bounded domains but needs help with unbounded. So perhaps the problem is specifically about extending to unbounded domains, hence the domain being unbounded is part of the problem's context. Therefore, the assumptions should include that the domain is unbounded. However, since f is defined on R^d, which is unbounded, that's already part of the function's domain. So maybe it's not necessary to state it as a separate assumption. \n\nAlternatively, the key challenge here is the unboundedness, so the assumption is that the domain is unbounded. But how to phrase that. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe domain of f is R^d (which is unbounded),\n\nf: domain → R^d is Lipschitz,\n\nE is a subset of the domain with Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that f(E) has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating. The simplest way is:\n\nAssumption:\n\nf: R^d → R^d is a Lipschitz function,\n\nE is a Lebesgue measure zero subset of R^d.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that f(E) has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nBecause the original problem is about functions on R^d (unbounded), and the user is asking how to extend from bounded to unbounded. So the problem is to show that even when the domain is unbounded, the Lipschitz function still maps measure zero sets to measure zero. So the assumptions are the function is Lipschitz on R^d, E is measure zero in R^d, and the problem is to show f(E) is measure zero.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ is a Lipschitz function,\n$E$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with Lebesgue measure zero.\nProblem:\nProve that $f(E)$ has Lebesgue measure zero.\n###",
