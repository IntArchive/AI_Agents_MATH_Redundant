    "Content": "The Fibonacci Sequence is defined as the recurrence\n$a(n)=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$ where $a(0)=0$ and $a(1)=1$. Today, I was bored so I considered the sequence $a(n)=\\sqrt{a_{n-1}}+\\sqrt{a_{n-2}}$. Ten minutes and a C program later, I discovered something: \n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}{a_n}=4$$\nIn addition, it doesn't matter what $a(0)$ and $a(1)$ are! It always converges. (Conjecture) More experimenting lead to a more generalized result: Consider $a(n)=a_{n-1}^{\\frac{1}{k}}+a_{n-2}^{\\frac{1}{k}}$ where $a(0)$ and $a(1)$ are any two positive real numbers and k is a positive integer greater than 1. This implies $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}{a_n}=2^{\\frac{k}{k-1}}$$\nI thought that this result was pretty funny so I came here. Can someone shine some light on this discovery and prove this conjecture right? (I'm pretty sure it's not wrong)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It'll make things easier for me to write $a_{n+2} = a_{n+1}^p + a_n^p$ ($0 < p < 1$), so that the expected limit satisfies $L = 2L^p$, hence $L = 2^{ \\frac{1}{1-p} }$. Let $b_n = 2^{ - \\frac{1}{1-p} } a_n$; then \n$$b_{n+2} = \\frac{b_n^p + b_{n+1}^p}{2}$$ and we want to show that $b_n \\to 1$ if $b_0, b_1$ are positive. The above implies\n$$\\text{min}(b_n^p, b_{n+1}^p) \\le b_{n+2} \\le \\text{max}(b_n^p, b_{n+1}^p)$$ and by induction we find that\n$$\\text{min}_{0 \\le i \\le 1, \\le \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor \\le j \\le n}(b_i^{p^j}) \\le b_{n+1} \\le \\text{max}_{0 \\le i \\le 1, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor \\le j \\le n}(b_i^{p^j})).$$ (The indices may be slightly off.) The conclusion follows from the simple fact that if $x > 0$ then $x^{p^n} \\to 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about a generalized Fibonacci sequence where each term is the sum of the k-th roots of the two previous terms. The user claims that the limit is 2^(k/(k-1)) regardless of initial conditions, as long as they're positive and k is an integer greater than 1.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem.\n\nThe sequence is defined by a(n) = sqrt(a_{n-1}) + sqrt(a_{n-2}) in the specific case mentioned first, but the generalized version uses a(n) = a_{n-1}^{1/k} + a_{n-2}^{1/k}. The initial conditions a(0) and a(1) are any positive real numbers. Also, k is a positive integer greater than 1. The problem is to prove that the limit as n approaches infinity is 2^{k/(k-1)}.\n\nSo breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The sequence is defined by the recurrence relation a(n) = a_{n-1}^{1/k} + a_{n-2}^{1/k}. Each term is the sum of the k-th roots of the two previous terms. So this applies to the sequence's recurrence.\n\n2. a(0) and a(1) are positive real numbers. That's two separate initial conditions, but since they're both about the initial terms being positive, maybe combine them as one assumption? Wait, the example given in the problem statement had two separate assumptions for n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. So perhaps each condition should be a separate line. However, in the original example, the user wrote two separate lines for \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the initial terms a(0) and a(1) are both positive. So perhaps each is a separate assumption? But the problem states \"any two positive real numbers\", so maybe a single assumption: \"a(0) and a(1) are positive real numbers\". Alternatively, split into two: \"a(0) is a positive real number\", \"a(1) is a positive real number\". But the example combined similar conditions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but in the example, the user added that as an assumption. Wait, no—the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem under the example lists \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but that might not be accurate. Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake? Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Hmm, but regardless, the instruction says to filter the unrelated information and list the assumptions. So, in this case, the problem is about the generalized sequence with k>1, positive initial terms, etc.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The sequence is defined by the recurrence relation a(n) = a_{n-1}^{1/k} + a_{n-2}^{1/k} for each n ≥ 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a(n) = a_{n-1}^{1/k} + a_{n-2}^{1/k} where a(0) and a(1) are any two positive real numbers and k is a positive integer greater than 1\". So:\n\n- The recurrence relation applies for all n ≥ 2 (since it's a recurrence like Fibonacci, which starts from n=2). But the problem statement doesn't specify n ≥ 2, but that's standard for recurrence relations. However, since we're supposed to list all assumptions, maybe we need to specify the domain of n. But the original example didn't specify that n is an integer in the assumption, but in the problem statement, it was given. Wait, in the original problem example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\", which was part of the original problem statement. So here, perhaps the first assumption is that the sequence is defined by that recurrence relation for all n ≥ 2. But the user might not have mentioned that explicitly. The problem says \"the sequence a(n) = ...\". So maybe the first assumption is about the recurrence formula.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants each assumption to be single line, each addressing one property. Let me try to list:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The sequence is defined by a(n) = a_{n-1}^{1/k} + a_{n-2}^{1/k} for n ≥ 2.\n\n- a(0) is a positive real number.\n\n- a(1) is a positive real number.\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n\n- k is greater than 1.\n\nThese are the assumptions given in the problem. The problem states \"k is a positive integer greater than 1\", so split into two: k is a positive integer, and k is greater than 1. But maybe that's redundant. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in that case, separate conditions. So here, \"k is a positive integer\" and \"k > 1\".\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. The sequence is defined by a(n) = a_{n-1}^{1/k} + a_{n-2}^{1/k} for n ≥ 2.\n\n2. a(0) is a positive real number.\n\n3. a(1) is a positive real number.\n\n4. k is a positive integer.\n\n5. k is greater than 1.\n\nAlternatively, if we can combine 4 and 5 as \"k is a positive integer greater than 1\", but according to the example, each assumption should address only one property. So splitting them.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate because the problem required n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original. That might be an error. So perhaps the example was wrong. Therefore, maybe the user intended that each assumption is a separate condition, even if they are related. So in this case, the problem's conditions are:\n\n- The recurrence relation.\n\n- a(0) and a(1) positive.\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n\n- k > 1.\n\nTherefore, listing each as separate assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe sequence is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a(n) = a_{n-1}^{1/k} + a_{n-2}^{1/k} \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\),\n\n\\( a(0) \\) is a positive real number,\n\n\\( a(1) \\) is a positive real number,\n\n\\( k \\) is a positive integer,\n\n\\( k \\) is greater than 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 2^{\\frac{k}{k - 1}} \\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. The problem mentions that the limit is 2^{k/(k-1)} regardless of initial positive a(0) and a(1), given that k is an integer greater than 1. So all these are the necessary assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user mentions \"k is a positive integer greater than 1\". So maybe \"k is a positive integer greater than 1\" can be one assumption. However, according to the example, each assumption should address only one property. So if k is required to satisfy two conditions: being a positive integer and being greater than 1, then they should be separate. But maybe \"k is an integer greater than 1\" can be one assumption, and \"k is positive\" is redundant since greater than 1 implies positive. However, the problem statement says \"k is a positive integer greater than 1\", which is redundant but perhaps the user wrote it that way. So in this case, maybe the first assumption is \"k is a positive integer\" and the second is \"k is greater than 1\".\n\nAlternatively, if \"k is a positive integer greater than 1\" is a single condition. But following the example's structure, where \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. So perhaps the example had an error, but the user wants to split into separate lines even if they are related. So in this case, splitting into \"k is a positive integer\" and \"k is greater than 1\".\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are as above.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit as n approaches infinity of a_n is 2^{k/(k-1)}.\n\nYes, that's the conjecture to be proven.",
