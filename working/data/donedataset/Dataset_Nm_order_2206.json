    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. The user wants to prove by induction that n! is less than or equal to ((n+1)/2)^n. The question is about filling in the steps in the induction proof, specifically the part where they have to show that ((n+2)/2)^{n+1} is greater than or equal to something that eventually leads to (n+1)!.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem is about proving an inequality via induction, so the key assumptions here would relate to the induction hypothesis and the steps required for the induction step.\n\nThe user's attempt shows they tried expanding the left-hand side and compared it to the right-hand side but got stuck. The induction step typically assumes the statement holds for n and then proves it for n+1. The user's calculation reaches a point where they need to show that ((n+2)/2)^{n+1} is at least 2*((n+1)/2)^{n+1}, which simplifies to ((n+1)/2)^n*(n+1). They need to connect this to n!*(n+1) which is (n+1)!.\n\nThe missing step likely involves manipulating the inequality ((n+2)/2)^{n+1} ≥ 2*((n+1)/2)^{n+1}. To fill this in, they need to show that ((n+2)/2) is at least 2^{1/(n+1)} times ((n+1)/2). However, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, using the induction hypothesis that n! ≤ ((n+1)/2)^n, then multiplying both sides by (n+1) gives (n+1)! ≤ (n+1)*((n+1)/2)^n. They need to show that this is ≤ ((n+2)/2)^{n+1}. So the key is to prove that (n+1)*((n+1)/2)^n ≤ ((n+2)/2)^{n+1}.\n\nDividing both sides by ((n+1)/2)^n, we get (n+1) ≤ ((n+2)/2)^{n+1}/((n+1)/2)^n) = (n+2)/2 * ((n+2)/(n+1))^n. So need to show that (n+2)/2 * ((n+2)/(n+1))^n ≥ n+1. Alternatively, rearranging terms, ((n+2)/(n+1))^n ≥ 2(n+1)/(n+2). Maybe using the inequality (1 + 1/(n+1))^n ≥ 2, but this might not hold for all n. Alternatively, perhaps using Bernoulli's inequality or another exponential inequality.\n\nWait, Bernoulli's inequality states that (1 + x)^r ≥ 1 + rx for x ≥ -1 and r ≥ 1. If we let x = 1/(n+1), then ((n+2)/(n+1))^n = (1 + 1/(n+1))^n ≥ 1 + n/(n+1). But 1 + n/(n+1) = (2n+1)/(n+1). Comparing this to 2(n+1)/(n+2), we need to check if (2n+1)/(n+1) ≥ 2(n+1)/(n+2). Cross-multiplying: (2n+1)(n+2) ≥ 2(n+1)^2. Expanding left: 2n(n+2) + 1*(n+2) = 2n² +4n +n +2 = 2n² +5n +2. Right side: 2(n² +2n +1) = 2n² +4n +2. Subtract right from left: (2n² +5n +2) - (2n² +4n +2) = n ≥ 0. Since n is a positive integer (assuming n ≥1), this holds. Therefore, ((n+2)/(n+1))^n ≥ (2n+1)/(n+1) ≥ 2(n+1)/(n+2). Hence, ((n+2)/2)^{n+1} ≥ (n+1)!.\n\nThis seems like the necessary step. Therefore, the missing part is showing that ((n+2)/2)^{n+1} ≥ 2*((n+1)/2)^{n+1} by using the inequality derived from Bernoulli's inequality. However, the user might not need to go into that depth, but rather recognize that the induction step requires this inequality. Therefore, the assumption here is that the induction hypothesis holds for n, and the problem is to complete the induction step by filling in the dots, i.e., proving that ((n+2)/2)^{n+1} is indeed greater than or equal to 2*((n+1)/2)^{n+1}.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user is asking for help in filling those steps. So when structuring the problem, the assumptions would include the induction hypothesis and any conditions on n (like n being a positive integer, which is typical for factorial and induction problems). However, the original problem didn't specify any constraints on n, but since factorial is defined for non-negative integers, and induction usually starts at a base case (like n=1), we can assume n is a positive integer.\n\nLooking back at the example, the user's formatted problem included assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". In this case, the problem is about induction, so the key assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The inequality holds for some integer k ≥1 (induction hypothesis).\n\nBut the user's formatted example for the previous problem included two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, the induction is being applied, so perhaps the assumptions should include the induction hypothesis. But the example didn't include the induction hypothesis in the assumptions. Instead, the example listed the conditions on the problem's variables. Maybe the assumptions here should list that n is a positive integer, and that the induction step requires the inequality to hold for n=k to prove for n=k+1. However, the user's example seems to list only the initial conditions, not the induction hypothesis. Since the problem is to structure the problem as per the format, the assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem, not the induction hypothesis itself.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"via induction\", so the method is given, but the problem is to show the inequality. The user's question is about filling the steps in the induction proof. So in terms of assumptions for the problem, the main conditions are that n is a positive integer (since factorial is defined for non-negative integers, but the inequality might start from n=1). However, the problem statement as given doesn't specify constraints on n, but in induction, we have a base case and then inductive step. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The base case holds (probably n=1 or n=0).\n- The induction hypothesis is that the inequality holds for some integer k ≥ base case.\n\nBut the example given by the user for the previous problem included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The induction method is applied.\n\nBut the user's example includes specific conditions on the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, since the problem is about proving an inequality for all positive integers via induction, the key assumption is that n is a positive integer. However, the original problem doesn't specify any restrictions beyond that. The user's confusion is in the induction step, particularly relating to the inequality involving ((n+2)/2)^{n+1} and connecting it to the right-hand side.\n\nSo when structuring the problem according to the format, the assumptions should list the conditions on n and any other objects. In this case:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that n! ≤ ((n+1)/2)^n using mathematical induction.\n\nBut the user's specific problem is about filling in the induction step, so maybe the problem is more precisely stated as the user presented: showing the inductive step where ((n+2)/2)^{n+1} ≥ ... ≥ (n+1)!.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be stated as in the original question, which is \"Prove that n! ≤ ((n+1)/2)^n via induction.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$n! \\leq \\left( \\frac{n+1}{2} \\right)^n$$ using mathematical induction.\n\nBut the user's question is specifically about the inductive step, so maybe the assumptions should include the induction hypothesis. However, in the example given, the assumptions were about the variable's properties, not the proof method's steps. So I think the main assumption here is that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove the inequality via induction, and the user is stuck on the inductive step. Therefore, the formatted problem should reflect the original problem statement and the key assumption (n is a positive integer).\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"n! ≤ ((n+1)/2)^n via induction\", and the question is about filling in the induction step. So when structuring the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the user's example included two assumptions for the previous problem. Here, there might be only one assumption. However, maybe there's more. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem:\n\nTitle: n! ≤ ((n+1)/2)^n via induction\n\nQuestion: I have to show n! ≤ ((n+1)/2)^n via induction. This is where I am stuck: [steps leading to ((n+2)/2)^{n+1} ≥ ... ≥ (n+1)!]. What could I do to fill the dots?\n\nSo the problem is to prove the inequality via induction, and the user is stuck on the inductive step. The formatted problem should capture the original problem's core: proving the inequality using induction, with the key assumption that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$n! \\leq \\left( \\frac{n+1}{2} \\right)^n$$ using mathematical induction.\n\nBut perhaps there's another assumption related to the base case. However, the example didn't include the base case in the assumptions. The example focused on the variable's properties. Therefore, sticking to the example's structure, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specific conditions like n ≥ 1 or starting from a certain base case, that would be an assumption, but since the user didn't mention it, we can assume it's for positive integers. Therefore, the formatted problem would be as above.",
