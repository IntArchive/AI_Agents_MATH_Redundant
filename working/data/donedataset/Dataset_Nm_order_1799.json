    "Content": "$\\def\\sign{\\operatorname{sign}}$ For homework, I am trying to show that the map $\\sign:S_n \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}$ is multiplicative, i.e. that for any permutations $\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2$ in the symmetric group $S_n$ , we have $$\\sign(\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2) = \\sign\\sigma_1 \\sign\\sigma_2.$$ The definition for $\\sign$ that I am using is that if $\\sigma = \\gamma_1\\cdots \\gamma_k$ is the cycle decomposition of $\\sigma \\in S_n$ and $\\ell_1,\\ldots,\\ell_k$ are the cycle lengths of $\\gamma_1,\\ldots,\\gamma_k$ respectively, then $$\\sign(\\sigma):= (-1)^{\\ell_1-1}\\cdots(-1)^{\\ell_k-1}.$$ I showed first that the formula holds for two transpositions.\nThen I showed that it holds for a transposition and a cycle. However, I got stuck trying to show that the formula holds for a transposition and a product of two cycles, i.e. $\\sigma_1 = \\tau$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\gamma_1\\gamma_2$ . I feel like this case is much more complicated than the others which makes me think I am taking the wrong approach. If $\\tau,\\gamma_1,\\gamma_2$ are all disjoint then the formula holds trivially because then $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\tau$ is the cycle decomposition of $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$ . Otherwise they are not all disjoint, at which point it seems to get complicated very quickly and I don't know how to proceed. Would someone please help me understand the best approach to this proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It's not really that difficult to show it for a transposition that straddles two disjoint cycles. The key is to see that if we have an $n$-element cycle disjoint from a $k$-element cycle and compose with a transposition of one element in each cycle, then you always get an $(n+k)$-element cycle -- there's essentially only one way the transposition can connect the cycles. And then $(-1)^{n+k-1}=-1\\times (-1)^{n-1}(-1)^{k-1}$. Together with showing it for a transposition and a cycle that contains both transposed elements (which I imagine is exactly the reverse of the above case), this is all you need to show (by induction) that if a permutation is a product of $n$ transpositions, then its sign is $(-1)^n$. For a general product of permutations, just decompose each factor into transpositions (you know you can always to this, right?) and count transpositions in each of them.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the sign function from the symmetric group S_n to {±1} is multiplicative. That means for any two permutations σ₁ and σ₂ in S_n, the sign of their product should be the product of their signs. The definition given for the sign is based on the cycle decomposition: if σ is decomposed into cycles γ₁...γ_k with lengths ℓ₁...ℓ_k, then sign(σ) is the product of (-1)^(ℓ_i - 1) for each cycle.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned they already handled the cases where both permutations are transpositions, and a transposition with a single cycle. Now they're stuck on the case where σ₁ is a transposition τ and σ₂ is a product of two cycles γ₁γ₂. They say that when τ, γ₁, γ₂ are disjoint, it's easy because the cycle decomposition of τγ₁γ₂ is straightforward. The problem arises when they aren't all disjoint, leading to complicated interactions.\n\nLet me think. The sign function is a homomorphism, so multiplicativity is key. The standard approach is to express permutations as products of transpositions and use the property that sign is a group homomorphism. However, the user is using a definition based on cycle lengths. Maybe they need to connect the cycle decomposition definition with transpositions.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that the sign of a permutation can also be defined as (-1)^(number of inversions) or as (-1)^(number of transpositions in a product). But the user's definition is cycle-based, so perhaps they need to relate the cycle decomposition of the product σ₁σ₂ to the cycle decompositions of σ₁ and σ₂.\n\nWhen multiplying permutations (composing them), the cycle structure can change depending on how the cycles interact. If τ is a transposition that intersects with one or both of the cycles γ₁ and γ₂, then composing τ with γ₁γ₂ can split or merge cycles. The key might be to track how the cycle structure changes and how that affects the sign.\n\nFor example, if τ swaps two elements in a single cycle of γ₁γ₂, that might split the cycle into two, or if it connects two cycles, it might merge them. Each such operation changes the number of cycles and their lengths, which in turn affects the sign. The classic result is that multiplying by a transposition changes the sign by -1, so if τ is a transposition, sign(τσ) = -sign(σ). But here, σ₂ is a product of two cycles, so maybe the interaction depends on whether τ is disjoint or not.\n\nWait, but the user is trying to show multiplicativity in general. Perhaps they should use induction on the number of transpositions in a decomposition of the permutations. Alternatively, since they already handled transpositions and cycles, maybe they can decompose the product of two cycles into transpositions and use the multiplicative property step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the property that the sign of a product of two permutations is the product of their signs, which is a fundamental property of group homomorphisms. But since the user is supposed to prove this from the cycle definition, they can't just cite it as a known fact.\n\nAnother thought: the sign function is equal to (-1)^{n - k}, where k is the number of cycles in the cycle decomposition (including 1-cycles). Wait, for a permutation with cycles of lengths ℓ₁, ℓ₂, ..., ℓ_k, the sign is product_{i=1}^k (-1)^{ℓ_i -1} = (-1)^{sum_{i=1}^k (ℓ_i -1)} = (-1)^{n - k}, since sum ℓ_i = n. So sign(σ) = (-1)^{n - k}, where k is the number of cycles. Therefore, multiplicativity of sign would require that sign(σ₁σ₂) = (-1)^{n - k₁} (-1)^{n - k₂} = (-1)^{2n - k₁ - k₂} = (-1)^{- (k₁ + k₂)}. But sign(σ₁σ₂) = (-1)^{n - k}, where k is the number of cycles in σ₁σ₂. Therefore, the equation to verify is (-1)^{n - k} = (-1)^{- (k₁ + k₂)}. Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe this approach isn't the easiest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula sign(σ) = (-1)^{number of transpositions in a decomposition}. Then, if σ₁ is a product of t₁ transpositions and σ₂ is a product of t₂ transpositions, then σ₁σ₂ is a product of t₁ + t₂ transpositions, so sign(σ₁σ₂) = (-1)^{t₁ + t₂} = (-1)^{t₁} (-1)^{t₂} = sign(σ₁) sign(σ₂). But this requires showing that the sign is well-defined, i.e., that any two decompositions into transpositions have the same parity. Which might be a different approach than the cycle decomposition.\n\nBut the user is using the cycle decomposition definition, so maybe they need to link the cycle decomposition of the product to the cycle decompositions of the factors. This seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe they can use the fact that the sign is a homomorphism by using the presentation of the symmetric group, but that might be too advanced.\n\nWait, the user is stuck on the case where σ₁ is a transposition and σ₂ is a product of two cycles. Let's consider different scenarios:\n\n1. The transposition τ is disjoint from both cycles γ₁ and γ₂. Then, the product τγ₁γ₂ is just the product of three disjoint cycles, so the cycle decomposition is straightforward, and the sign is the product of the signs of τ, γ₁, γ₂. So sign(τγ₁γ₂) = sign(τ) sign(γ₁) sign(γ₂). But since σ₂ is γ₁γ₂, sign(σ₂) = sign(γ₁) sign(γ₂). Then sign(τσ₂) = sign(τ) sign(σ₂), which is multiplicative. So this case works.\n\n2. τ intersects with one of the cycles, say γ₁. Then composing τ with γ₁γ₂ may alter the cycle structure. Suppose γ₁ is a cycle containing elements a and b, and τ swaps a and c. Then composing τ with γ₁ might split γ₁ into two cycles or merge it with another cycle. The exact effect depends on the specific interaction.\n\nIn general, multiplying a permutation by a transposition either increases or decreases the number of cycles by 1, which would change the sign by -1. For example, if you have a cycle (a b c d) and multiply by (a e), then depending on where e is, you might split or merge. But in the case of multiplying by a transposition, the sign changes by -1, so sign(τσ) = -sign(σ). But τ itself has sign -1, so sign(τ) sign(σ) = (-1) * sign(σ) = -sign(σ), which matches. Therefore, in this case, multiplicativity holds.\n\nBut how does this extend when σ is a product of two cycles? Suppose σ₂ = γ₁γ₂. If τ is a transposition that interacts with γ₁ or γ₂, then multiplying by τ would change the cycle decomposition of σ₂. If τ acts on elements within γ₁ or γ₂, it could split one of the cycles into two or merge them. Each such operation changes the number of cycles by ±1, hence changing the sign by -1. But since τ itself has sign -1, then sign(τ) sign(σ₂) = (-1) * sign(σ₂) would correspond to the sign of τσ₂, which is exactly the change in sign due to altering the cycle structure.\n\nWait, maybe the key idea is that every transposition changes the sign, so when you multiply by a transposition, you flip the sign. Therefore, regardless of the permutation you multiply with, the sign of the product is the product of the signs. But to formalize this, you need to show that multiplying by a transposition flips the sign, which can be derived from the cycle decomposition definition.\n\nFor example, take a permutation σ with cycle decomposition γ₁...γ_k. If you multiply by a transposition τ, then τσ will have a cycle decomposition that either splits a cycle into two or merges two cycles into one. Let's verify this:\n\nCase 1: τ is disjoint from σ. Then, τσ is just τσ, and since they're disjoint, the cycle decomposition is τ followed by σ. Then sign(τσ) = sign(τ) sign(σ), which is multiplicative.\n\nCase 2: τ shares elements with σ. Suppose τ swaps two elements in a single cycle of σ. Then τσ will split that cycle into two cycles. For example, if σ has a cycle (a b c d), and τ = (a c), then τσ = (a c)(a b c d) = (a d)(b c). The original cycle had length 4, contributing (-1)^{4-1} = (-1)^3 = -1. The new cycles have lengths 2 and 2, each contributing (-1)^{2-1} = -1, so total sign is (-1)(-1) = 1. The original sign was -1, so multiplying by τ (which has sign (-1)^{2-1} = -1) gives sign(τ) sign(σ) = (-1)(-1) = 1, which matches the new sign.\n\nConversely, if τ connects two cycles, say σ has cycles (a b) and (c d), and τ = (a c), then τσ = (a c)(a b)(c d). Let's compute this product. Compose from right to left: applying (c d), then (a b), then (a c). Let's see where each element goes:\n\nStart with a: (c d) doesn't affect a. Then (a b) sends a to b. Then (a c) sends b to b (since (a c) only swaps a and c). So overall a → b.\n\nb: (c d) → b, (a b) → a, (a c) → a (since a goes to c). So b → a → c.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute more carefully. Let's do step by step:\n\nFirst permutation is σ = (a b)(c d). Then τ = (a c). So τσ means first apply σ, then τ.\n\nWait, permutation multiplication is function composition, so τσ means σ followed by τ. So for any element x, τσ(x) = τ(σ(x)).\n\nLet's compute τσ:\n\nTake x = a: σ(a) = b, then τ(b) = b (since τ swaps a and c). So τσ(a) = b.\n\nx = b: σ(b) = a, τ(a) = c. So τσ(b) = c.\n\nx = c: σ(c) = d, τ(d) = d. So τσ(c) = d.\n\nx = d: σ(d) = c, τ(c) = a. So τσ(d) = a.\n\nOthers (if any) are unchanged.\n\nSo the permutation τσ maps a→b→c→d→a, which is a 4-cycle (a b c d). Wait, but originally σ was two transpositions, so sign(σ) = (-1)^{2-1} * (-1)^{2-1} = (-1)(-1) = 1. τ is a transposition, sign(τ) = -1. So sign(τσ) should be -1 * 1 = -1. But the new permutation is a 4-cycle, whose sign is (-1)^{4-1} = -1. So indeed sign(τσ) = -1 = sign(τ) sign(σ).\n\nIn this case, multiplying by τ merged two transpositions into a 4-cycle, decreasing the number of cycles by 1 (from 2 to 1), thus changing the sign by -1. Since τ has sign -1, the product of signs is -1 * 1 = -1, matching the sign of the product permutation.\n\nSo this suggests that in general, multiplying by a transposition changes the number of cycles by ±1, thus flipping the sign. Hence, sign(τσ) = -sign(σ) = sign(τ) sign(σ).\n\nIf this holds in general, then multiplicativity follows by induction. Since any permutation can be written as a product of transpositions, and if each multiplication by a transposition flips the sign, then the sign of the product is the product of the signs.\n\nBut the user is working with cycle decompositions. Maybe they need to generalize this argument. For the case where σ₂ is a product of two cycles, multiplying by a transposition τ either merges them or splits one, depending on τ's interaction. Either way, the number of cycles changes by 1, so the sign flips. Since τ has sign -1, then sign(τσ₂) = -sign(σ₂) = sign(τ) sign(σ₂). Therefore, multiplicativity holds in this case.\n\nTherefore, the user might need to recognize that regardless of how the transposition interacts with the cycles in σ₂, multiplying by τ either increases or decreases the number of cycles by 1, thus flipping the sign, which aligns with the multiplicative property.\n\nSo the key idea is that multiplying by a transposition inverts the sign, and this holds regardless of the cycle structure of the permutation being multiplied. Therefore, even if σ₂ is a product of two cycles, multiplying by τ still flips the sign, hence multiplicativity holds.\n\nThus, the user might need to generalize their earlier steps, showing that for any permutation σ, multiplying by a transposition τ changes the sign by -1, hence sign(τσ) = sign(τ) sign(σ). Then, since any permutation can be decomposed into transpositions, the multiplicative property follows by induction.\n\nBut the user is specifically stuck on the case where σ₂ is a product of two cycles. To resolve this, they could use the fact that multiplying by a transposition τ will either merge the two cycles (if τ connects them) or split one of the cycles (if τ acts within one cycle). Either way, the number of cycles changes by 1, so the total exponent in the sign formula changes by ±1, equivalent to multiplying by -1. Hence, sign(τσ₂) = -sign(σ₂) = sign(τ) sign(σ₂).\n\nThis case-by-case analysis for the product of a transposition and a two-cycle product should suffice. Then, combining all cases, multiplicativity holds generally.",
