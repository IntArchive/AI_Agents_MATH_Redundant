    "Content": "This problem was given to me by a friend: Prove that $\\Pi_{i=1}^m \\mathbb{S}^{n_i}$ can be smoothly embedded in a Euclidean space of dimension $1+\\sum_{i=1}^m n_i$. The solution is apparently fairly simple, but I am having trouble getting a start on this problem. Any help?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "EDIT: I cannot delete this post as it's been already accepted :( The proof is carried out by induction on $m.$ $m=1$ is trivial by choosing coordinates $(x^{(1)}_0,x^{(1)}_1,...,x^{(1)}_{n_1})$ where $\\sum_{j=0}^{n_1} (x_j^{(1)})^2=1$, so let $m=2,$ then similarly $S^{n_1} \\times S^{n_2}$ is embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n_1+n_2+2}$ which also lies in the hypersurface $H$ with equation $\\sum_{j=0}^{n_1} (x_j^{(1)})^2+\\sum_{j=0}^{n_2} (x_j^{(2)})^2=2.$ In fact, $H$ is diffeomorphic to $S^{n_1+n_2+1}.$ Now, the embedding is missing at least a point, for example $p=(0,...,0,1,1) \\in H,$ so by stereographic projection $S^{n_1+n_2+1} \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n_1+n_2+1}.$ Suppose that the assertion holds for $<m,$ then $(S^{n_1}\\times...\\times S^{n_{m-1}}) \\times S^{n_m}$ is embedded diffeomorphically in $\\mathbb{R}^{n_1+...+n_{m-1}+1} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_m+1}\\cong \\mathbb{R}^{n_1+...+n_{m}+2}$ hence following the same argument you can reduce the dimension by $1,$ so the result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The task is to prove that the product of spheres, specifically the product of m spheres with dimensions n₁, n₂, ..., nₘ, can be smoothly embedded in a Euclidean space of dimension 1 plus the sum of all those n_i. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what an embedding is. A smooth embedding is a smooth injective immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image. So, we need to construct a map from the product of spheres into Euclidean space of the specified dimension that satisfies these properties.\n\nThe target dimension is 1 + Σn_i. Let's note that each sphere S^{n_i} embeds into ℝ^{n_i + 1}, which is its usual ambient space. The product of these spheres would then naturally sit in the product of their ambient spaces, which would be ℝ^{(n₁ + 1) + (n₂ + 1) + ... + (nₘ + 1)} = ℝ^{Σn_i + m}. But the problem wants to embed into a space of dimension 1 + Σn_i, which is much lower, especially if m is large. So the usual product embedding isn't sufficient here.\n\nThis suggests that we need a more efficient embedding. Maybe some kind of combined mapping that uses the fact that the spheres are being multiplied together. Let's think about the case when m=2. Suppose we have S^{a} × S^{b}. The usual embedding would be in ℝ^{a+1} × ℝ^{b+1} = ℝ^{a + b + 2}, but we need to embed into ℝ^{a + b + 1}. How can we reduce the dimension by one?\n\nOne idea is to use a mapping that combines the coordinates in a way that shares one dimension. For example, perhaps using a common axis or parameter. Wait, there's the Whitney embedding theorem which says that any smooth manifold of dimension d can be embedded into ℝ^{2d}, but here we have a product of spheres whose total dimension is Σn_i, and the target is Σn_i + 1, which is better than Whitney's 2d. So there must be a special structure here.\n\nAnother thought is that spheres are stably parallelizable, so maybe their products have nice embedding properties. Alternatively, maybe we can use an embedding that combines the coordinates of each sphere into a higher-dimensional space but with some relation.\n\nWait, let's think about each sphere S^{n_i} as embedded in ℝ^{n_i + 1}. Let me denote the coordinates of each sphere as x_i ∈ ℝ^{n_i + 1} with ||x_i|| = 1. Then the product space Π S^{n_i} is the set of tuples (x₁, x₂, ..., x_m) where each x_i is a unit vector in their respective spaces.\n\nTo embed this into ℝ^{1 + Σn_i}, perhaps we can map each x_i into a lower-dimensional space, but in such a way that their combination uses only one extra dimension. For example, maybe we can combine all the coordinates into a single vector, but adjust them so that their norms are scaled appropriately.\n\nLet me consider the case when m=2. Let's say S^{n} × S^{m}. We need to embed this into ℝ^{n + m + 1}. Suppose we take each point (x, y) where x ∈ S^{n} ⊂ ℝ^{n+1} and y ∈ S^{m} ⊂ ℝ^{m+1}. How to combine these into ℝ^{n + m + 1}? Maybe take their coordinates but interleave them or use a common coordinate.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Suppose we consider each sphere S^{n_i} as sitting in ℝ^{n_i + 1}, but then projectively map them into a common space. Alternatively, use a mapping that \"suspends\" the product. Alternatively, think of the product as a subset of the join of the spheres, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the product of spheres can be embedded by using a combination of the coordinates with some constraint. For example, if we have two spheres S^a and S^b, maybe we can embed their product into R^{a + b +1} by using coordinates (x, y, t) where x is in R^{a+1}, y is in R^{b+1}, and t is a scalar such that ||x||^2 + ||y||^2 + t^2 = 1? No, that would give a sphere of dimension a + b +1, which isn't the product.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If we have two spheres S^a and S^b, their product is (a + b)-dimensional. To embed into R^{a + b +1}, maybe we can use a mapping that uses the fact that the product can be \"suspended\" once. Alternatively, use an affine combination.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the standard embeddings of each sphere S^{n_i} into R^{n_i +1} as unit vectors. Then the product of these spheres would naturally be in the product space R^{Σ(n_i +1)}. But we need to map this into R^{1 + Σn_i}. The difference in dimension is (Σ(n_i +1)) - (1 + Σn_i) ) = m -1. So we need to reduce the dimension by m -1. How?\n\nPerhaps by combining the coordinates in a way that uses some shared parameters. For instance, if we have m spheres, maybe we can use a scaling factor for each sphere such that the sum of their squares is 1, thereby using one extra dimension to account for these scalings.\n\nSpecifically, suppose we take each x_i ∈ S^{n_i} ⊂ R^{n_i +1}, and then scale them by some t_i ∈ R such that Σ t_i^2 = 1. Then the combined coordinates would be (t_1 x_1, t_2 x_2, ..., t_m x_m). But this gives a join of the spheres, not the product. The join of m spheres would have dimension Σn_i + m -1, which might not help here.\n\nAlternatively, consider the product S^{n₁} × ... × S^{n_m} and map it into R^{1 + Σn_i} by using a function that for each sphere, uses its coordinates and a common scaling factor. For example, let’s define a map f(x₁, x₂, ..., x_m) = (x₁, x₂, ..., x_m, 0) but this would require more dimensions. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use an orthogonal embedding. Each sphere S^{n_i} is in R^{n_i +1}. Let’s consider embedding each S^{n_i} into R^{1 + Σn_i} by placing each in orthogonal subspaces, but with one extra dimension. For example, the first sphere S^{n₁} is embedded in the first (n₁ +1) dimensions, the next S^{n₂} in the next (n₂ +1) dimensions, but since the total available is 1 + Σn_i, this might not fit unless we overlap dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, use the extra dimension as a common direction. For example, for each sphere, use one coordinate from the extra dimension and the rest from their own. But how?\n\nLet me think of a concrete example. Suppose m=2, n₁=1, n₂=1. So S¹ × S¹ (a torus) needs to embed into R^{1+1+1}=R³. Wait, but the standard torus embeds into R³, so that works. The usual embedding of the torus is in R³, which is 1+1+1. So in this case, it's possible. How is that done? The standard torus is embedded using a parametrization that combines angles, but each S¹ is in R², and the product would be in R² × R² = R⁴, but by rotating one around the other, we can embed it into R³. So the idea is that we can use a combination of the angles with a common axis.\n\nSo maybe for the general case, we can use a similar idea. For each sphere S^{n_i}, we have coordinates in R^{n_i +1}. We can take the product and then map them into a higher-dimensional space by combining their coordinates with some scaling factors that sum up in a certain way, using the extra dimension to parameterize the scaling.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the product of spheres can be seen as a subset of the product of Euclidean spaces, and then project that product into a lower-dimensional space. But projections might not be injective.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the Whitney embedding. If we can find an injective map from the product manifold into the Euclidean space of dimension 1 + Σn_i. Since the product manifold has dimension Σn_i, by Whitney it can be embedded into R^{2Σn_i}, but we need a better dimension. So there's something special about the product of spheres that allows a more efficient embedding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that each sphere is a hypersurface in its ambient space. So perhaps the product can be embedded as a hypersurface in the sum of the ambient spaces minus m-1 dimensions. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another idea. If we have m spheres S^{n₁}, ..., S^{n_m}, each embedded in R^{n_i +1}, then the product embeds into R^{Σ(n_i +1)}. We need to map this into R^{1 + Σn_i}. The difference in dimensions is Σ(n_i +1) - (1 + Σn_i) = m -1. So we need to find a way to reduce the dimension by m-1.\n\nOne way to reduce dimensions is to have m-1 constraints. If we can find m-1 functions that are preserved under the embedding, then we can quotient out those dimensions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, use a mapping that combines the coordinates of each sphere in such a way that m-1 dimensions are shared or collapsed. For example, consider that each sphere's embedding uses a common coordinate. \n\nWait, here's a possible construction. Let me try to define the embedding explicitly. For each sphere S^{n_i}, we have its embedding in R^{n_i +1} as the unit sphere. Now, consider the product Π S^{n_i} as tuples (x₁, x₂, ..., x_m) where each x_i is a unit vector in R^{n_i +1}. Now, define a map f: Π S^{n_i} → R^{1 + Σn_i} as follows:\n\nFor each i, take the coordinates of x_i (which has n_i +1 components), but exclude the last coordinate of each x_i. Then, collect all these coordinates into a single vector in R^{Σn_i}, and add an additional coordinate which is the product of the last coordinates of each x_i.\n\nBut wait, each x_i is a unit vector, so if we exclude the last coordinate, say z_i, then the remaining coordinates satisfy x_i1² + ... + x_in_i² + z_i² =1. So z_i = sqrt(1 - (x_i1² + ... + x_in_i²)). But then if we take all x_i1, ..., x_in_i for each i, and then have a final coordinate which is the product of all z_i, then we map the product into R^{Σn_i +1}.\n\nBut is this map injective? Let's see. Suppose two points (x₁, ..., x_m) and (y₁, ..., y_m) map to the same point. Then all their x_ik coordinates (excluding the last) are equal, and the product of their z_i's are equal. But since each z_i is determined by the other coordinates (z_i = sqrt(1 - ||x_i'||²)), where x_i' is the vector without z_i, then if x_i' = y_i' for all i, then z_i = sqrt(1 - ||x_i'||²) = sqrt(1 - ||y_i'||²) = z_i, so the product of z_i's would also be equal. Hence, the only way two different points map to the same image is if they have the same x_i' coordinates for all i, but different z_i's. But since z_i is determined by x_i', they cannot differ in z_i if x_i' are the same. Therefore, this map is injective.\n\nWait, but if two different points have the same x_i' for all i, but different z_i's, but z_i is determined by x_i', they can't have different z_i's. Because z_i is a function of x_i'. Hence, this map is injective.\n\nBut what about smoothness? The map is smooth because it's composed of projections and the product function, which is smooth.\n\nIs it an immersion? We need to check that the derivative is everywhere injective. Suppose we take a tangent vector at a point (x₁, ..., x_m). The derivative in the direction of a tangent vector would involve the derivatives of the x_i' components and the derivative of the product of z_i's. Since the product of z_i's depends on all the z_i's, which in turn depend on the x_i' components, the derivative would involve terms from all spheres. We need to ensure that the derivative map is injective. This might require more careful analysis, but intuitively, since each x_i' is included in the coordinate and the product term adds an extra dimension, it should prevent the derivative from having a kernel, hence making it an immersion.\n\nTherefore, this construction might work. Let's formalize it:\n\nFor each sphere S^{n_i} embedded in R^{n_i +1}, write each point as (x_i1, ..., x_in_i, z_i) where z_i = sqrt(1 - Σx_ik²). Then the embedding f: Π S^{n_i} → R^{Σn_i +1} is given by:\n\nf(x₁, ..., x_m) = (x₁1, ..., x₁n₁, x₂1, ..., x₂n₂, ..., x_m1, ..., x_mn_m, Π_{i=1}^m z_i)\n\nThis uses Σn_i coordinates for all the x_ik's and one coordinate for the product of z_i's, totaling 1 + Σn_i dimensions.\n\nWe need to check if this is an embedding. As discussed, injectivity holds because if two points have the same x_ik's, their z_i's are determined, so the product of z_i's must be the same. Smoothness is clear. The immersion part needs checking, but assuming that the derivative doesn't vanish, which seems plausible since varying any x_ik would change the corresponding coordinate and also the product term through z_i. Hence, this should be an immersion.\n\nTherefore, this construction provides a smooth embedding of the product of spheres into R^{1 + Σn_i}.",
