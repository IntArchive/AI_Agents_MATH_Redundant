    "Content": "In order to prove the following identity:\n$$\\sum_{k}\\epsilon_{ijk}\\epsilon_{lmk}=\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jm}-\\delta_{im}\\delta_{jl}$$\nInstead of checking this by brute force, Landau writes thr product of Levi-Civita symbols as:\n$$\\epsilon_{ijk}\\epsilon_{lmn}=\\det\\left|\n   \\begin{array}{cccc}\n      \\delta_{il}   & \\delta_{im}  & \\delta_{in}   \\\\\n      \\delta_{jl}   & \\delta_{jm}  & \\delta_{jn}   \\\\\n      \\delta_{kl}   & \\delta_{km}  & \\delta_{kn}   \n   \\end{array}\n\\right|\n$$ The proof that the equalty holds is quite straightforward if you consider what values the indices can take. But I've been told that there's a much more profound and elegant demonstration based on the representation of the symmetric group. Does anybody know this approach based on group theory?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I know this from physics courses but only when you sum from 1 to 3. And the argument is quite simple: For $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ to be nonzero $ijk$ has to be pairwise different. So $(ijk)$ can be understood as permutation, than $\\epsilon_{ijk} = \\text{sign}(ijk)$. For $\\epsilon_{ijk}\\epsilon_{lmk}$ to be nonzero you have only two situations: 1) i=l and j=m, so $\\text{sign}(ijk)=\\text{sign}(lmk)$ 2)i=m and j=l, so $\\text{sign}(ijk)=-\\text{sign}(lmk)$ Therefore $ \\sum_{k}\\epsilon_{ijk}\\epsilon_{lmk}=\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jm}-\\delta_{im}\\delta_{jl}$ note that these aruguments can only be made when your indices can range from 1 to 3",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the original problem again carefully. The question is about proving a relation between the Levi-Civita symbol and Kronecker deltas using group theory, specifically the representation of the symmetric group. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states an identity involving the sum over k of the product of two Levi-Civita symbols, resulting in a combination of Kronecker deltas. The user mentions that Landau uses a determinant of Kronecker deltas to express the product of two Levi-Civita symbols, and there's a desire to find a proof using group theory rather than brute force or the straightforward method of checking indices.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are related to the properties of the Levi-Civita symbol and the Kronecker delta, as well as the context of group theory. Let me break down each assumption:\n\n1. The Levi-Civita symbols ε_ijk and ε_lmk are involved. These are antisymmetric tensors.\n2. The sum is taken over index k. So, the equation is summed over one of the indices.\n3. The identity to prove is the sum over k resulting in δ_il δ_jm - δ_im δ_jl. This relates the product of two Levi-Civita symbols to Kronecker deltas.\n4. Landau's approach expresses the product of two Levi-Civita symbols as a determinant of a matrix composed of Kronecker deltas. This determinant is a 3x3 matrix with entries like δ_il, δ_im, etc.\n5. The user mentions a proof based on the representation theory of the symmetric group, which is part of group theory. So, the assumption here is that such a group-theoretic approach exists and is applicable to this identity.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the group theory-based proof, so the key assumption is the existence of such a method. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variables involved. In this case, the problem is more about the method of proof rather than the conditions on the variables. Since the original example included mathematical conditions (like n being an integer and divisible by 7), here the assumptions might need to relate to mathematical objects and their properties.\n\nWait, maybe the assumptions here are the properties of the Levi-Civita symbol and the Kronecker delta. For example:\n\n- The Levi-Civita symbol ε_ijk is antisymmetric under permutation of indices.\n- The Kronecker delta δ_ij is symmetric in its indices.\n- The determinant expression provided by Landau is a valid representation of the product of two Levi-Civita symbols.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the given identity using group theory, specifically the representation of the symmetric group. So the key assumption here is that such a group-theoretic framework can be applied to derive the identity. However, I need to list each assumption as a single property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLet me think. Each assumption should be a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The Levi-Civita symbol ε_{ijk} is a completely antisymmetric tensor.\n- The Kronecker delta δ_{ij} is a symmetric tensor.\n- The product of two Levi-Civita symbols ε_{ijk} ε_{lmk} is summed over index k.\n- The determinant of a matrix formed by Kronecker deltas represents the product of Levi-Civita symbols.\n\nBut the problem mentions using the representation theory of the symmetric group. So perhaps the assumption is that the symmetric group's representation theory can be applied to derive the identity. But how to phrase that as an assumption? Maybe:\n\n- The symmetric group's representation theory provides a framework for proving tensor identities.\n\nBut the user is asking for a proof using that approach, not assuming that it works. Hmm, maybe the assumptions are more about the mathematical objects involved rather than the method. The problem is to prove the identity using group theory, so perhaps the assumptions include the properties of the Levi-Civita symbol and the Kronecker delta as tensors under the symmetric group's action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are the properties of the Levi-Civita symbol and the Kronecker delta, and the problem is the identity itself. Since the original example had the problem as proving divisibility, here the problem is to prove the given identity using group theory.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The Levi-Civita symbol ε_{ijk} is a third-order antisymmetric tensor.\n- The indices i, j, k, l, m are elements of the set {1, 2, 3}.\n- The summation convention over repeated indices is applied (summing over k in this case).\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify the dimension, but typically Levi-Civita in 3D. However, the problem might be in 3 dimensions, which is an assumption. So maybe:\n\n- The Levi-Civita symbol ε_{ijk} is defined in three-dimensional space.\n- The indices i, j, k, l, m, n range over the values 1, 2, 3.\n- The summation over the index k is implied.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention 3D, but given that the Levi-Civita symbol with three indices is standard in 3D. So perhaps that's an implicit assumption.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not need those assumptions because the Levi-Civita symbol is already defined in 3D. The key is to list all necessary assumptions for the problem. The example given had the assumption on n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- The Levi-Civita symbols ε_{ijk} and ε_{lmk} are considered in three dimensions.\n- The indices i, j, l, m are fixed, and summation is performed over the index k.\n- The Kronecker delta δ_{ij} is the identity tensor.\n\nBut how does the group theory come into play? The user is told there's a proof using the representation of the symmetric group. So maybe the assumption is that the Levi-Civita symbol transforms under the symmetric group's representation. But I'm not sure. Maybe the problem doesn't require listing group theory as an assumption but rather the properties of the tensors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem itself is to use the symmetric group's representation theory to prove the identity, so the assumption is that such a representation exists. But I think the user is asking how to do that, not assuming it. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nIn the original example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is about the identity between tensors. So perhaps the assumptions should include:\n\n- The Levi-Civita symbol ε_{ijk} is antisymmetric in all indices.\n- The Kronecker delta δ_{ij} is symmetric in its indices.\n- The determinant expression given by Landau is valid for the product of two Levi-Civita symbols.\n\nBut the determinant expression is part of Landau's method, which the user is referencing. However, the user is asking for an alternative proof using group theory. So maybe the problem statement doesn't require assuming the determinant form, but rather that the identity needs to be proven, possibly using group theory.\n\nWait, but the user is mentioning that Landau writes the product as a determinant, and the proof of equality is straightforward by considering indices, but the user wants a group-theoretic approach. So the assumptions are:\n\n- The Levi-Civita symbols ε_{ijk} and ε_{lmk} are defined in three dimensions.\n- The Kronecker delta δ_{ij} is the identity tensor.\n- The product of two Levi-Civita symbols can be expressed via a determinant of Kronecker deltas.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the given identity using group theory. So perhaps the key assumption is that the symmetric group's representation theory can be applied here. But since the user is asking for that approach, maybe it's not an assumption but part of the problem's requirement.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Levi-Civita symbol ε_{ijk} is a completely antisymmetric tensor in three dimensions.\n- The indices i, j, k, l, m range over the set {1, 2, 3}.\n- The summation convention is applied over repeated indices.\n\nProblem:\nProve the identity $$\\sum_{k}\\epsilon_{ijk}\\epsilon_{lmk}=\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jm}-\\delta_{im}\\delta_{jl}$$ using the representation theory of the symmetric group.\n\nBut the user also mentions Landau's determinant approach. However, the determinant expression might not be an assumption but part of Landau's method. The user wants an alternative proof. So maybe the determinant part is not an assumption here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove the determinant expression using group theory, but the user's main question is about the original identity. The user states that Landau's proof is straightforward but there's a group-theoretic approach. So the problem is to prove the original identity using group theory, not necessarily the determinant expression.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would relate to the Levi-Civita symbols and their properties in three dimensions, and the problem is to prove the sum identity using group theory.\n\nBut to fit the format as in the example, where assumptions were about the variables and conditions (like n being integer and divisible by 7), here the assumptions might be:\n\n- The indices i, j, k, l, m are integers from 1 to 3.\n- The Levi-Civita symbol ε_{ijk} is antisymmetric under exchange of any two indices.\n- The Kronecker delta δ_{ij} is 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise.\n- Summation over repeated index k is implied.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the given identity. The user's question is how to do this via group theory, so maybe the key assumption is the applicability of symmetric group representations. However, in the example, the assumption was about the variable n; here, assumptions are about the mathematical objects involved.\n\nI think the best way is to list the mathematical properties necessary for the problem, even if they are part of the definitions. Since the user mentions group theory, but the problem is to apply it, perhaps the assumptions include the properties of the Levi-Civita symbol and Kronecker delta as tensors under the symmetric group's action. However, I'm not entirely sure how to phrase this. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Levi-Civita symbol ε_{ijk} transforms as a tensor under the symmetric group S_3.\n- The Kronecker delta δ_{ij} is invariant under the symmetric group S_3.\n- The product of two Levi-Civita symbols can be decomposed into Kronecker deltas via group representation theory.\n\nBut I'm not confident if these are correct. Alternatively, stick to the basic properties:\n\nAssumption:\n- The Levi-Civita symbol ε_{ijk} is completely antisymmetric in its indices.\n- The Kronecker delta δ_{ij} is symmetric in its indices.\n- The indices i, j, l, m range over 1, 2, 3.\n- Summation is implied over the repeated index k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k}\\epsilon_{ijk}\\epsilon_{lmk}=\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jm}-\\delta_{im}\\delta_{jl}$$ using the representation theory of the symmetric group.\n\nThis seems closer to the required format. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. The first two assumptions are about the Levi-Civita and Kronecker delta's properties. The third specifies the index range, and the fourth the summation convention. Then the problem is to prove the identity using group theory.\n\nYes, this should work.",
