    "AcceptedAnswer": "To show that the $d$-metric topology is coarser than $\\mathcal{T}$ we must show that every $d$-open set is $\\mathcal{T}$-open.  Of course, it really suffices to show that every $d$-ball is $\\mathcal{T}$-open (since the $d$-balls form a basis for the $d$-metric topology).  To show that the $d$-ball $B ( x , \\epsilon )$ is $\\mathcal{T}$-open it suffices to find for each $y \\in B ( x , \\epsilon )$ a $\\mathcal{T}$-open neighbourhood $V$ of $y$ such that $V \\subseteq B ( x , \\epsilon )$. First, the continuity of $d$ implies that for each $\\epsilon > 0$ the set $$U_\\epsilon := \\{ ( u , v ) \\in X \\times X : d ( u , v ) < \\epsilon \\} = d^{-1} [ ( -\\infty , \\epsilon ) ]$$ is open in $X \\times X$ with respect to the topology $\\mathcal{T}$ (or $\\mathcal{T} \\times \\mathcal{T}$, if you will). Now, given $x \\in X$ and $\\epsilon > 0$, we want to show for all $y \\in B ( x , \\epsilon )$ that there is a $\\mathcal{T}$-open set $V$ with $y \\in V \\subseteq B ( x , \\epsilon )$.  As $y \\in B ( x , \\epsilon )$, it follows that $( x , y ) \\in U_\\epsilon$, and since $U_\\epsilon$ is a $( \\mathcal{T} \\times \\mathcal{T} )$-open subset of $X \\times X$, there are $\\mathcal{T}$-open $U , V \\subseteq X$ such that $$( x , y ) \\in U \\times V \\subseteq U_\\epsilon.$$  In particular $V$ is a $\\mathcal{T}$-open neighbourhood of $y$. Note that given any $z \\in V$ we have that $( x , z ) \\in U \\times V \\subseteq U_\\epsilon$, and so by definition of $U_\\epsilon$ it follows that $d ( x , z ) < \\epsilon$, meaning that $z \\in B ( x , \\epsilon )$.  We may then conclude that $V \\subseteq B ( x , \\epsilon )$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, which includes listing assumptions and then stating the problem. Let me start by understanding the original question thoroughly.\n\nThe title is \"How is the metric topology the coarsest to make the metric function continuous?\" The question elaborates: Given a metric space X with metric d, if there's a topology T on X such that the function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous, then show that T is finer than the topology induced by d. In other words, prove that the metric topology is the coarsest topology for which d is continuous.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The example provided in the problem statement lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the original question for such assumptions.\n\n1. The space X is a metric space with metric d. So, X has a metric d defined on it.\n2. There exists a topology T on X such that the function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous. Here, T is a topology where d is continuous. However, the product topology on X × X would typically be considered when discussing continuity of d. So, the continuity of d is with respect to topology T on X and the standard topology on ℝ. But the original question doesn't explicitly mention the product topology, so maybe I should note that the continuity of d is with respect to the product topology on X × X induced by T.\n\nWait, the problem states that d is continuous as a function from X × X to ℝ. For that continuity, the topology on X × X is the product topology of T with itself. So the assumption here is that T is a topology on X such that when you take the product topology on X × X (from T), the function d is continuous. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- X is a set equipped with a metric d.\n- T is a topology on X.\n- The function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous when X × X is endowed with the product topology induced by T, and ℝ has the standard topology.\n\nAdditionally, the problem is to show that T is finer than the metric topology induced by d. So, the metric topology is the one generated by open balls from d, and we need to show that any topology T making d continuous must contain all open sets of the metric topology.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition. Let me break them down:\n\n1. X is a metric space with metric d. (This is given in the problem statement.)\n2. T is a topology on X. (The problem mentions \"a topology on X\".)\n3. The function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous with respect to the product topology on X × X induced by T and the standard topology on ℝ. (This is the key condition that d is continuous under topology T.)\n\nWait, the original problem says \"the function d is continuous\", so perhaps the third assumption is that d is continuous when X is equipped with topology T. However, since d is a function from X × X to ℝ, the continuity depends on the topology of X × X, which is the product topology of T with T. So the third assumption is indeed that d is continuous with respect to the product topology of T on X × X and the standard topology on ℝ.\n\nBut how to phrase each assumption as a single line? Let me check the example given. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each line is a separate condition on a single object.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAssumption 1: X is a metric space with metric d. (This combines two things: X is a metric space, and the metric is d. However, maybe split if necessary, but in the example, the first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", so combining is acceptable if they're part of the same statement.)\n\nAssumption 2: T is a topology on X. (This is a separate condition on T.)\n\nAssumption 3: The function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous with respect to the product topology on X × X induced by T and the standard topology on ℝ. (This is a single condition on d and T.)\n\nHowever, the problem might not need to state that X is a metric space as an assumption, because the problem is about the metric topology. Wait, but the problem says \"Let X be a metric space with metric d\". So that is an assumption given in the problem. Therefore, the first assumption is that X is a metric space with metric d.\n\nThe second assumption is that T is a topology on X such that d is continuous. However, the continuity of d is with respect to T's product topology. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption 1: X is a metric space with metric d.\n\nAssumption 2: T is a topology on X.\n\nAssumption 3: The function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous when X × X is equipped with the product topology induced by T.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The problem then is to show that T is finer than the metric topology induced by d.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nAssumptions were:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the original problem here, the assumptions are given in the problem setup. The user is to list all the assumptions, which are given in the problem. So in this case:\n\nOriginal problem's assumptions:\n\n- X is a metric space with metric d.\n\n- T is a topology on X.\n\n- d is continuous as a function from X × X (with product topology from T) to ℝ.\n\nProblem: Show that T is finer than the metric topology induced by d, i.e., that the metric topology is the coarsest topology for which d is continuous.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. X is a metric space with metric d.\n\n2. T is a topology on X.\n\n3. The function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous with respect to the product topology on X × X induced by T and the standard topology on ℝ.\n\nProblem: Prove that T is finer than the topology induced by d.\n\nAlternatively, to make each assumption apply to one object, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- X is a metric space with metric d.\n\n- T is a topology on X.\n\n- The product topology on X × X is induced by T.\n\n- The function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous (under the product topology induced by T and standard topology on ℝ).\n\nBut the third assumption about the product topology is inherent when we talk about continuity of d, so maybe it's redundant. The problem states that d is continuous, which implicitly uses the product topology on X × X. Therefore, perhaps the third assumption is redundant and not needed. Let's see.\n\nThe key is that the user must list all the assumptions given in the problem. The original problem says:\n\n\"Let X be a metric space with metric d. If T is a topology on X such that the function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous, then how to show that T is finer than the topology induced by the metric d?\"\n\nSo the explicit assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a metric space with metric d.\n\n2. T is a topology on X.\n\n3. The function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous (with respect to T's product topology and standard topology on ℝ).\n\nTherefore, each of these is an assumption.\n\nNow, structuring each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is a metric space with metric d,\n\nT is a topology on X,\n\nThe function d: X × X → ℝ is continuous with respect to the product topology on X × X induced by T and the standard topology on ℝ.\n\nProblem: Prove that T is finer than the topology induced by d.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the third assumption into two parts? For example, the product topology is induced by T, and d is continuous under that. But I think the third assumption as written is a single condition: the continuity of d under the product topology from T.\n\nNow, checking the example:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. However, the formatted problem in the example listed the assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, which seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake there, but maybe the original problem had a missing condition. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumptions are:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's a mistake unless the original problem actually required n divisible by 7, but the user example might have been a mistake. Alternatively, maybe in that problem, the divisibility by 91 holds for all integers n, but the user's formatted problem erroneously added the assumption. However, this might be a confusion, but in any case, following the example, each assumption is listed line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nSo applying the same approach here:\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\nLet X be a metric space with metric d. If T is a topology on X such that d is continuous, then show T is finer than the metric topology.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a metric space with metric d.\n\n2. T is a topology on X.\n\n3. The function d is continuous as a map from X × X (with product topology from T) to ℝ (with standard topology).\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these three assumptions, each on its own line.\n\nProblem: Prove that T is finer than the topology induced by d.\n\nNow, writing this in the required format.",
