    "Content": "When I read the item of compact operator on Wikipedia, it said that Let $T_{n}, ~~n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ , be a sequence of compact operators from\n  one Banach space to the other, and suppose that $T_n$ converges to $T$ with respect to the operator norm. Then $T$ is also compact. Can anyone give me a brief proof of this? Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A compact operator is one which is the limit (in the norm topology) of finite rank operators.  Thus by a diagonal argument, the limit of a norm-convergent sequence of compact operators can be written as the limit of a norm-convergent sequence of finite rank operators, and so is again compact. Added: As the comment below indicate, this argument is valid in the generality of the question.  But perhaps the general approach can be salvaged? Turning to another characterization of compact operators (valid in full generality), let $T_m \\to T$ be our norm convergent sequence of compact operators, and let $x_n$ be a sequence in the unit ball of their domain. We have to find a Cauchy subsequence of $T(x_n).$  (This will show that\n$T$ is compact.)  We know that any subsequence of $T_m(x_n)$ ($m$ fixed)\ncontains a Cauchy subsequence (since $T_m$ is compact).  We know that \n$T_m(x_n)$ ($n$ fixed) converges to $T(x_n)$, and this convergence is\nuniform in $n$ (since $|| T(x_n) - T_m(x_n) || \\leq || T - T_m|| || x_n||\n\\leq || T - T_m||,$ which $\\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$). Now a diagonal argument will let us find a Cauchy subsequence of $T(x_n)$. More precisely, let $x_{n_{1,i}}$  be a subsequence of $x_n$ such that $T_1(x_{n_{1,i}})$ is Cauchy.  Pass to subsequences inductively as follows: assuming that we have chosen the subsequence\n$x_{n_{m,i}}$, take $x_{n_{m+1,i}}$ to be a subsequence of $x_{n_{m,i}}$ such that $T_{m+1}(x_{n_{m+1,i}})$ is Cauchy. Now define $x_{n_i} = x_{n_{i,i}}$.  Then $T_m(x_{n_i})$ is Cauchy for every $m$, and you can deduce from this that $T(x_{n_i})$ is Cauchy.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem should be separated. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"How to show that the limit of compact operators in the operator norm topology is compact.\" The question body mentions that if T_n is a sequence of compact operators between two Banach spaces and T_n converges to T in the operator norm, then T is also compact. The user is asking for a brief proof.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions should list each condition, one per line, applied to a single object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The problem involves a sequence of operators T_n where n is a natural number.\n2. Each T_n is a compact operator. So one assumption is that each T_n is compact.\n3. The operators are between two Banach spaces. So the domain and codomain are Banach spaces.\n4. The sequence T_n converges to T in the operator norm topology. So the convergence is in the operator norm.\n5. The conclusion is that T is compact. The problem is to prove this.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- T_n is a sequence of compact operators for each n in N.\n- The domain and codomain of T_n are Banach spaces.\n- T_n converges to T in the operator norm.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that T is compact.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, addressing one property. Checking the example: in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. So here, similarly, each condition on T_n and the spaces should be separate.\n\nPotential mistakes: Including unnecessary details. The original question mentions \"from one Banach space to the other,\" so specifying domain and codomain are Banach spaces. Also, the convergence is in operator norm, which is a specific topology.\n\nAnother thing: The example included two assumptions, but here there are three. Let me check again:\n\n1. Each T_n is a compact operator. (One assumption)\n2. The operators are between Banach spaces. (Another assumption about the spaces)\n3. The convergence is in operator norm. (Third assumption about the mode of convergence)\n\nYes, that's three separate assumptions. So the formatted problem would list those three, each on their own line.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that T is compact.\n\nI think that's all. Let me double-check the original question to ensure no other conditions are missed. The user on Math Stack Exchange didn't add any extra conditions; the problem is as stated. So the assumptions are correctly extracted.",
