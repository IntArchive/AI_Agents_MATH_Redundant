    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that the conclusion is wrong, and let $m$ be the smallest\nindex such that $a_m \\ne 0$. Without loss of generality we can\nassume that $m=1$, i.e.\n$$ \\tag 1\na_1 \\ne 0 \\, .\n$$ Let $0 < \\varepsilon <  \\frac 12|a_1|$. $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n$ is absolutely convergent, therefore  there is an integer $N$ such that $$\n  \\sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty |a_n| < \\varepsilon \\, .\n$$\nand in particular $|a_n| < \\varepsilon$ for $n > N$. It follows that\nfor all integers $k$,\n$$\n  \\sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty |a_n|^k \\le \\sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty \\varepsilon^{k-1}|a_n| = \\varepsilon^{k-1} \\sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty |a_n| < \\varepsilon^k \\, .\n$$ Since $\\sum a_n^k =0$, the $k$-th power sums\n$$\np_k := p_k(a_1, \\ldots, a_N) = \\sum_{n=1}^N a_n^k\n$$\nsatisfy\n$$ \\tag 2\n  |p_k| =  \\bigl| \\sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty a_n^k \\, \\bigr| \\le \n  \\sum_{n=N+1}^\\infty |a_n|^k < \\varepsilon^k\n$$\nfor $1 \\le k \\le N$. Now let\n$$\ne_k := e_k(a_1, \\ldots, a_N) \n$$ be the $k$-th elementary symmetric polynomial in the variables $a_1, \\ldots, a_N$. Then $e_0 = 1$, and Newton's identities state that\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n e_1 &= p_1 \\\\\n 2e_2 &= e_1 p_1 - p_2 \\\\\n 3e_3 &= e_2 p_1 - e_1 p_2 + p_3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nand generally\n$$ \\tag 3\n k e_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{i-1} e_{k-i} p_i \\, \\text{ for } k \\ge 0 \\, .\n$$ From $(2)$ and $(3)$ it follows easily by induction that \nthe elementary symmetric polynomials satisfy\n$$\n  |e_k| \\le \\varepsilon^k \\text{ for } 0 \\le k \\le N \\, .\n$$ Now define\n$$\nP(x) = (x-a_1)(x-a_2) \\cdots (x-a_N) \\\\\n= x^N - e_1 x^{N-1} + e_2 x^{N-2} \\cdots \\pm e_N \\, .\n$$\nThen $P(a_1) = 0$ and therefore $r := |a_1|$ satisfies\n$$\n r^N \\le |e_1| r^{N-1} + |e_2| r^{N-2} + \\cdots + |e_N| \\\\\n \\le \\varepsilon r^{N-1} + \\varepsilon^2 r^{N-2} + \\cdots + \\varepsilon^N \\\\\n = \\varepsilon r^{N-1} \\bigl( 1 + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{r } + \\cdots + \n(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{r })^{N-1} \\bigr)\n$$\nor \n$$\n1 \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon}{r } \\bigl( 1 + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{r } + \\cdots + \n(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{r })^{N-1} \\bigr) \\, .\n$$\n$\\varepsilon$ was chosen such that $0 < \\frac \\varepsilon r < \\frac 12$, therefore\n$$\n1 < \\frac 12 \\bigl( 1 + \\frac 12 + \\cdots + \n(\\frac 12)^{N-1} \\bigr) < 1 \n$$\nwhich is a contradiction.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me first read and understand the original question thoroughly.\n\nThe original problem is titled: \"$a_n =0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb N$ if $\\sum a_n^k =0$ for all integers $k \\ge 1$\". The user's question states: Suppose that $\\sum a_n$ is an absolutely converging complex series and that for all integers $k \\ge 1$, $\\sum a_n^k =0$. How to prove that the $a_n$ are all equal to $0$? They mention trying to extend Newton's identities but are stuck on writing a proper proof.\n\nAlright, the task is to break this problem into assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided helps. Let's parse the original problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states that $\\sum a_n$ is an absolutely converging complex series. That's one assumption: the series converges absolutely, and the terms are complex numbers. Then, it's given that for all integers $k \\geq 1$, the sum $\\sum a_n^k = 0$. That's another assumption. The conclusion to prove is that all $a_n$ are zero.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, in this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The series $\\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent. (This is a condition on the series.)\n2. The series $\\sum a_n^k = 0$ for all integers $k \\geq 1$. (This applies to each k.)\n\nBut these are two separate assumptions. The first is about the convergence of the series, the second about the sums of the powers being zero. The conclusion is that each $a_n = 0$.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum a_n$ is an absolutely convergent complex series,\nFor all integers $k \\ge 1$, $\\sum a_n^k = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $a_n = 0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nWait, but in the example, each assumption is a single line. So here, the first assumption is the absolute convergence and that the series is complex. Wait, but maybe \"absolutely converging complex series\" is a single condition. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So maybe here, each part should be separate. However, in the problem statement, the series being absolutely convergent and complex is a single condition. Let me think.\n\nIn the original problem statement, the user says: \"Suppose that $\\sum a_n$ is an absolutely converging complex series...\" So that's one assumption: the series is absolutely convergent and the terms are complex. But perhaps in the problem's context, these are two separate conditions. But maybe not. The key is that the series is of complex numbers and converges absolutely. So maybe that's a single assumption. Alternatively, the user might have intended that the series converges absolutely (which in itself implies certain things, but the terms being complex is part of the problem's setup). Hmm.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum a_n$ is a complex series,\n$\\sum a_n$ converges absolutely,\nFor all integers $k \\ge 1$, $\\sum a_n^k = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $a_n = 0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nBut the original problem states \"absolutely converging complex series\", which combines two properties: complex terms and absolute convergence. But the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines, even though both apply to n. Similarly here, \"complex series\" and \"absolutely convergent\" are two separate properties of the series. So each should be a separate assumption line.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\sum a_n$ is a complex series,\n$\\sum a_n$ converges absolutely,\nFor all integers $k \\ge 1$, $\\sum a_n^k = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $a_n = 0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nBut let me check if \"complex series\" is necessary as an assumption. The original problem states that the series is an absolutely converging complex series, so the fact that the terms are complex is part of the problem's setup. So in the assumptions, we should list that the series is complex (i.e., each $a_n$ is a complex number), and that the series converges absolutely. These are two separate assumptions. Then the third assumption is that for all k ≥ 1, the sum of the k-th powers is zero.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$\\sum a_n$ is a complex series,\n$\\sum a_n$ converges absolutely,\nFor all integers $k \\ge 1$, $\\sum a_n^k =0$.\nProblem:\nProve that $a_n =0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem only included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in that example, perhaps the key was to split conditions even if they are on the same object. Similarly here, splitting the series being complex, its absolute convergence, and the sums of powers being zero.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the assumptions are three separate points. Each addresses one property applied to the series or the terms. The first is the series being complex (each term is a complex number), the second is the convergence, and the third is the condition on the powers.",
