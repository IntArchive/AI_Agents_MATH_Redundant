    "Content": "Consider the flow $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $L_{\\omega}(x)$ the $\\omega$-limit set of a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. How can I show that if $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is compact, then it is connected? I think one should assume it is connected and then get an absurd. Some help here would be nice. Also, how can a limit set not be compact or connected? All the (common) examples I can think are compact and connected. Can someone give an exemple?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "So... After some more thinking I got a proof. Assume $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is not connected. So there are disjoint open sets $A,B\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $L_{\\omega} \\subset A \\cup B$ and $A \\cap L_{\\omega},B\\cap L_{\\omega}$  are non empty. Therefore, there are sequences $\\{t_n\\},\\{s_n\\}$ such that $\\displaystyle\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} t_n=\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n=\\infty$, $t_n<s_n<t_{n+1}$ and $\\varphi_{t_n}(x)\\in A, \\varphi_{s_n}(x)\\in B$ for all $n$.\nNow $\\{\\varphi_t(x); t\\in (t_n,s_n)\\}$ is a curve joining a point in $A$ to a point in $B$. Then there is a $r_n\\in (t_n,s_n)$ such that $\\varphi_{r_n}(x) \\notin A\\cup B$. Note that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}r_n=\\infty$. We know that $\\{\\varphi_{r_n}(x)\\}\\subset L_{\\omega}(x)$. Since it is compact, there is a subsequence of $\\{\\varphi_{r_n}(x)\\}$ converging to a point $y \\notin A \\cup B$. But that means that $y \\in L_{\\omega}(x)$. This contradiction completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nLooking at the title: \"Compact $\\omega$-limit set $\\Rightarrow$ connected\". The main problem here is to show that if the $\\omega$-limit set $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is compact, then it must be connected. The user also asks for an example where the limit set isn't compact or connected.\n\nIn the original problem, the flow is given as $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, and $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is the $\\omega$-limit set of a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. The user wants to prove that compactness implies connectedness for this set. They also mention attempting a proof by contradiction (assuming it's not connected) and request examples of non-compact or non-connected limit sets.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem statement should be restructured concisely.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n1. The flow is defined as $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n2. $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is the $\\omega$-limit set of a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n3. $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is compact.\n\nThe problem is to prove that $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is connected under these assumptions. Additionally, the user asks for examples where the limit set isn't compact or connected, but according to the example provided, the problem part should only include the main problem, and the examples might be considered as separate questions. However, since the original problem includes both the proof and the request for examples, I need to check if the example given in the user's instruction includes such parts. The user's example only included the problem statement in the \"Problem\" section, so maybe the request for examples should be part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just the proof part. Let me re-examine the example:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91. The formatted problem included the assumptions (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7) and the problem statement. The additional parts of the question (like the examples) were not included in the formatted problem. So perhaps here, the main problem is to prove compact implies connected, and the examples are secondary. However, the user's original question includes both the proof and the examples. The instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format. The example included only the main problem in the Problem section. So perhaps here, the Problem should include both parts: proving connectedness under compactness and providing examples. Alternatively, maybe the examples are separate.\n\nBut the given example structured only the main problem. Let me check the user's instruction again: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated information, and structure that problem as the following format\". The example included only the main problem in the Problem section. The user's original problem here has two parts: proving the implication and giving examples. However, the example in the user's instruction includes only one problem. Maybe the examples are considered separate questions, but since the user wrote \"Can someone give an example?\" as part of the same question, perhaps we need to include both in the Problem section. But according to the format, it's \"Problem: <The problem>\". The example had the problem as the divisibility statement. So in this case, the problem would be two-fold: proving compact implies connected, and providing examples where the limit set is not compact or connected. However, the format example shows only one problem. Maybe the way to handle it is to have the problem section include both, but in the user's example, they had a single problem. Alternatively, perhaps the second part about examples is a separate problem. However, since the user's original question includes both, maybe the Problem should include both parts. Let me check the original question again:\n\nOriginal question: \"How can I show that if $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is compact, then it is connected? I think one should assume it is connected and then get an absurd. Some help here would be nice. Also, how can a limit set not be compact or connected? All the (common) examples I can think are compact and connected. Can someone give an exemple?\"\n\nSo the problem has two parts: 1) Prove that compact implies connected. 2) Provide examples where the limit set is not compact or not connected.\n\nBut the example given by the user in the instruction had the problem as a single statement. So perhaps the user wants both parts included in the Problem section. Alternatively, maybe the second part is considered a separate problem. However, the original problem is presented as a single question. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the Problem section should include both parts. However, looking at the example, the user's formatted problem included only the main problem (prove divisibility by 91), not any additional parts. Therefore, maybe the examples here are considered separate, but since the original question includes them, perhaps they should be included.\n\nBut the instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", and the example includes only the main problem. Therefore, maybe the main problem is to prove compact implies connected, and the request for examples is an additional part. However, in the format provided, the \"Problem\" section is a single statement. Therefore, perhaps we need to structure the problem as the main proof part, and the example request is another problem. But since the user hasn't given an example with multiple problems, maybe we should follow the example and include only the main problem. Alternatively, perhaps the Problem section can include both parts. Let me think again.\n\nThe example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nHere, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, this seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, looking back, the user-provided example might have a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it by adding an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because if the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but 91=13*7, then perhaps the original problem had a missing condition. But regardless, following the example, the formatted problem includes assumptions, even if they weren't in the original problem. Wait, that example is confusing. But the key point is that the formatted problem lists assumptions, even if they are implicit in the original problem.\n\nIn our current problem, the original question asks to prove that if L_omega(x) is compact, then it is connected. So the assumption is that L_omega(x) is compact, and the problem is to prove it's connected. Additionally, the user is asking for examples where the limit set isn't compact or connected.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem includes the assumptions and the problem. So for the main part, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The flow is defined as $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n2. $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is the $\\omega$-limit set of a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n3. $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is compact.\n\nProblem: Prove that $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is connected.\n\nBut the original question also asks for examples. However, in the example given by the user, the additional parts (like \"for every integer n\") were not included in the problem statement, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer. So perhaps the assumptions here would include the flow, the definition of the limit set, and the compactness. Then the problem is to prove connectedness. The request for examples is a separate part, but according to the example, it might be omitted from the formatted problem. However, the original problem explicitly asks two things: to prove the implication and to provide examples. Therefore, perhaps both should be included in the problem statement.\n\nBut the example provided by the user includes only the main problem. So perhaps the user wants only the main problem to be structured, filtering out the request for examples. Alternatively, maybe the examples are considered part of the problem. The instruction says to \"filter the unrelated information\". The example includes a part where the user initially had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like the user adjusted the problem to correct it, but perhaps in reality, the original problem might have had a different condition. But since I don't have the original context, I have to work with what's given.\n\nGiven the user's instruction, the task is to extract assumptions and the problem, filtering unrelated information. The original question is about proving compactness implies connectedness for the omega-limit set, and also asking for examples. The example provided by the user in their instruction shows that sometimes assumptions are listed even if they are part of the original problem's conditions. For example, in their example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, in this case, we need to list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The flow is $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n- $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is the $\\omega$-limit set of a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n- $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is compact.\n\nProblem:\n- Prove that $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is connected.\n- Provide examples where the $\\omega$-limit set is not compact or not connected.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem section is a single statement. However, the original problem here has two parts. The example in the user's instruction structured a problem with one statement. Therefore, maybe the answer should split into two problems? But the user hasn't indicated that. Alternatively, perhaps the examples are considered part of the problem. Given that, I will structure the problem as including both parts. However, the user's example only included the main problem. This is a bit ambiguous, but following the user's example, perhaps only the main problem is structured, and the examples are considered additional but not part of the structured problem. Alternatively, maybe the user wants both parts.\n\nBut looking back at the original problem's title: \"Compact $\\omega$-limit set $\\Rightarrow$ connected\". The main problem is the implication. The examples are additional requests. Therefore, perhaps the Problem section should be only the first part, and the examples are another problem. But since the user's original question includes both, but the example in the instruction only includes one problem, I need to follow the example's structure.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The flow is $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n- $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is the $\\omega$-limit set of a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n- $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is compact.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is connected.\n\nThe request for examples would then be a separate problem, but since the user's instruction's example didn't include such, perhaps it's omitted here. However, the original question explicitly includes the examples request. Therefore, maybe the problem should include both. Alternatively, since the example in the instruction didn't include a two-part problem, perhaps we need to separate them. But the user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format. Given that, the answer should focus on the main problem: proving connectedness under compactness. The request for examples is a separate question, but perhaps in the context of the original problem, it's part of it. However, in the example provided, the user included only the main problem, so perhaps here we should do the same. Therefore, the Problem section would be \"Prove that if $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is compact, then it is connected.\" The examples part would be omitted as per filtering unrelated information. But the user's original problem mentions both. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe the examples are considered part of the problem. Alternatively, they are considered separate. Since the user's example didn't include multiple parts, I will structure the main problem and assume the examples are a separate question. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The flow is $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n- $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is the $\\omega$-limit set of a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n- $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is compact.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $L_{\\omega}(x)$ is connected.\n\nThe examples part would be considered a separate problem, but since the user didn't structure it that way in their example, perhaps it's omitted. Therefore, the final answer would be structured as above.",
