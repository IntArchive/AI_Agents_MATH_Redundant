    "Content": "Given an n-dimensional ellipsoid in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ , is any orthogonal projection of it to a subspace also an ellipsoid? Here, an ellipsoid is defined as $$\\Delta_{A, c}=\\{x\\in \\Bbb R^n\\,:\\, x^TAx\\le c\\}$$ where $A$ is a symmetric positive definite n by n matrix, and $c > 0$ . I'm just thinking about this because it gives a nice visual way to think about least-norm regression. I note that SVD proves immediately that any linear image (not just an orthogonal projection) of an ellipsoid is also an ellipsoid, however there might be a more geometrically clever proof when the linear map is an orthogonal projection.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes they do. You can prove it by induction on the codimension of the subspace you project to. For $x\\in Vect(e_1,\\ldots e_{n-1})$ there exists $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x+te_n$ belongs to $\\Delta$ iff the discriminant of the degree $2$ equation $(x+te_n)^TA(x+te_n)\\leq c$ w.r.t. the unknown $t$ is non-negative, which turns out to still be a quadratic inequality in $x$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. First, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Do ellipsoids cast ellipsoidal shadows?\" and the user is asking whether any orthogonal projection of an n-dimensional ellipsoid in ℝⁿ onto a subspace is also an ellipsoid. The ellipsoid is defined as Δ_{A,c} = {x ∈ ℝⁿ : xᵀAx ≤ c} where A is symmetric positive definite and c > 0.\n\nThe user also mentions that using SVD shows any linear image (including orthogonal projections) of an ellipsoid is an ellipsoid, but they're looking for a more geometrically intuitive proof specifically for orthogonal projections. However, the task here isn't to answer the question but to structure it into the specified format.\n\nFirst, identify all assumptions. The problem states an n-dimensional ellipsoid in ℝⁿ. The definition given uses a symmetric positive definite matrix A and a positive constant c. The projection in question is an orthogonal projection onto a subspace. So each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions:\n1. The object is an n-dimensional ellipsoid in ℝⁿ. So the first assumption is that Δ_{A,c} is an n-dimensional ellipsoid in ℝⁿ.\n2. The ellipsoid is defined by xᵀAx ≤ c. So the next assumption is that Δ_{A,c} = {x ∈ ℝⁿ : xᵀAx ≤ c}.\n3. The matrix A is symmetric positive definite. That's another assumption.\n4. c is a positive constant (c > 0).\n5. The projection considered is an orthogonal projection. So the subspace projection is orthogonal.\n\nEach of these should be a separate line in the assumptions. The problem is to determine if any orthogonal projection of this ellipsoid onto a subspace is also an ellipsoid. The user is specifically focusing on orthogonal projections, not general linear maps, even though they mention SVD applies to linear images. So the problem statement is as given.\n\nLet me check the example provided. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate line. So here, similarly, each condition about the ellipsoid, the matrix A, the constant c, and the projection being orthogonal should be separate.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nΔ_{A,c} is an n-dimensional ellipsoid in ℝⁿ,\nΔ_{A,c} is defined as {x ∈ ℝⁿ : xᵀAx ≤ c},\nA is a symmetric positive definite n×n matrix,\nc is a positive real number (c > 0),\nthe projection is an orthogonal projection onto a subspace.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether any orthogonal projection of Δ_{A,c} onto a subspace is also an ellipsoid.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user is asking \"is any orthogonal projection... also an ellipsoid?\" So the problem is to prove or determine if that's the case. The example's problem was \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is a yes/no question but phrased as \"is any orthogonal projection...\" So perhaps the problem statement should be \"Prove that any orthogonal projection of Δ_{A,c} onto a subspace is also an ellipsoid.\" Or is it a question? The original title is a yes/no question, but the actual problem is to determine whether that's true.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" Here, maybe the problem is \"Prove that any orthogonal projection of an n-dimensional ellipsoid in ℝⁿ onto a subspace is also an ellipsoid.\" But the user hasn't stated it as a claim but as a question. However, the example converted the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. So perhaps here, we should restate the question as a problem to prove.\n\nThe original question is asking \"is any orthogonal projection... also an ellipsoid?\" So the problem would be \"Prove that any orthogonal projection of Δ_{A,c} onto a subspace is an ellipsoid.\" But since the user might be unsure if it's true, the problem could be phrased as \"Determine whether any orthogonal projection... is also an ellipsoid.\" But the example uses \"Prove,\" so maybe the correct approach is to rephrase the question as a statement to prove. However, the user hasn't provided their own answer, just the question. So perhaps the problem should be phrased as a question. Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that...\", so the user converted the original problem into that. Here, the user's question is \"is any orthogonal projection... also an ellipsoid?\" So perhaps the problem should be presented as that question.\n\nBut the example took the original problem and structured it as \"Prove that...\" even if the original was a statement. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's problem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in that example, the assumption added that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the user modified the problem to add assumptions? Wait no, the original problem's example was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer. But the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which would restrict n. That contradicts. So maybe the example is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to modify the problem for the example. But that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's original problem was different. Maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example given here, it's presented as the formatted problem. Wait, maybe the example was an illustration of how to structure a problem, not necessarily an exact transformation. So the user might have edited the original problem to create an example. Therefore, perhaps in this case, I should follow the instruction to structure the given problem as per the format, regardless of the example's potential inconsistency.\n\nGiven that, the original question is: \"Given an n-dimensional ellipsoid in ℝⁿ, is any orthogonal projection of it to a subspace also an ellipsoid?\" So the problem is to determine this.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement is written as \"Prove that...\", but in this case, it's a question. However, since the user wants to structure the problem as per the example, perhaps the problem should be phrased as a directive, like \"Prove or disprove: Any orthogonal projection...\".\n\nBut looking back at the user's instructions, they said:\n\n\"structure that problem as the following format. You will be given some example which I structured before.\"\n\nThe example's problem was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So even though the original problem in the example might have been different, the user structured it as a \"Prove that\" statement. Therefore, in this case, even if the original question is a yes/no question, we should structure the problem as \"Prove that any orthogonal projection...\" or \"Determine whether any orthogonal projection...\", but the example uses \"Prove that\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the problem to be restated as a claim to prove, even if the original is a question. Because the example transformed the original problem (which might have been a question) into a \"Prove that\" statement.\n\nTherefore, for consistency with the example, perhaps the problem should be written as \"Prove that any orthogonal projection of an n-dimensional ellipsoid... is also an ellipsoid.\"\n\nHowever, the original question is phrased as a yes/no question, so maybe the problem is to answer whether it's true. But since the example structured it as a statement to prove, maybe we should do the same. Alternatively, perhaps in cases where the problem is a question, the problem is phrased as a question. The example's original problem was a statement (\"Prove that...\"), so it was kept as such. Here, the original problem is a question, so maybe the problem should be phrased as a question. Let me check the user's instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nThe example's formatted problem has \"problem: Prove that...\".\n\nBut the original problem in the example was also a \"Prove that...\" statement. So perhaps in cases where the original problem is a question, we still structure it as a directive. Alternatively, maybe we should retain the original phrasing. However, the example restructured the original problem's wording. For instance, the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem's problem is \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So they removed the \"for every integer n\" part because it's now in the assumptions.\n\nIn this current problem, the original question is \"Given an n-dimensional ellipsoid... is any orthogonal projection... also an ellipsoid?\" So to structure it, we need to move the conditions into assumptions and leave the problem as a directive. But since it's a yes/no question, perhaps the problem is \"Determine whether any orthogonal projection... is also an ellipsoid.\" But the example used \"Prove that...\". However, the example's original problem was a \"Prove that\" question. So perhaps here, the user wants to structure the problem as a \"Prove that...\" even if the original is a question. But that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, since the user wants to format the problem by listing assumptions and then the problem statement, perhaps the problem part should be the exact question being asked. If the original question is a yes/no question, then the problem is to answer that question, i.e., \"Determine whether any orthogonal projection... is also an ellipsoid.\"\n\nBut the example's problem part was a statement to prove. So there's inconsistency here. But maybe the user allows for both forms. Since the original problem here is a question, perhaps the problem should be stated as a question. However, the example restructured a \"Prove that...\" into a shorter \"Prove that...\", moving the quantifiers into assumptions.\n\nIn this case, the original question is \"Given an n-dimensional ellipsoid... is any orthogonal projection... also an ellipsoid?\" So the assumptions would include the given conditions, and the problem is to determine the answer.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem statement, we rephrase it as \"Prove that any orthogonal projection... is an ellipsoid\" assuming the answer is yes. But maybe the answer is yes, and the user wants to prove it. Alternatively, if it's not necessarily true, the problem could be to determine it.\n\nBut since the user mentions that SVD proves that any linear image is an ellipsoid, and they're asking specifically about orthogonal projections, which are linear maps, so the answer would be yes. Therefore, the problem is to prove that.\n\nHowever, to adhere to the original question's phrasing, which is a question, perhaps the problem should be \"Determine whether any orthogonal projection... is also an ellipsoid.\" But the example transformed the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. So maybe the correct approach is to structure it as a \"Prove that...\" statement.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed by structuring the problem as a directive to prove the statement, assuming that the answer is affirmative, based on the user's note that SVD shows linear images are ellipsoids. Therefore, the problem is to prove that orthogonal projections (a specific type of linear map) result in ellipsoids.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would have assumptions about the ellipsoid's definition, the matrix properties, and the projection being orthogonal. Then the problem is to prove that the projection is an ellipsoid.",
