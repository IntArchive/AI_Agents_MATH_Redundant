    "Content": "In 1847 Lamé had announced that he had proven Fermat's Last Theorem.  This \"proof\" was based on the unique factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[e^{2\\pi i/p}]$.  However, Kummer , proved that when $p=23$ we do not have unique factorization, and in fact Kummer proved this 3 years earlier in 1844. My question is:  how can you prove that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_p]$ does not have unique factorization when $p = 23$, but does for $p < 23$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Two remarks. Class field theory can be eliminated from Paul's answer: if the degree $(L:K)$ of an extension of number fields is coprime to the class number $h_K$ of $K$, the $h_K \\mid h_L$.\nThe proof follows by observing that the transfer of ideal classes $j: Cl(K) \\longrightarrow Cl(L)$ composed with the relative norm is just raising to the $(L:K)$-th power in the class group of $K$. Since the relative degree in the example at hand is $11$, this remark applies here. Showing that the class number is $1$ for $p < 23$ is difficult. Kummer proved that the ring of integers inside the 5th roots of unity is Euclidean, but this method becomes impossible to use for $p > 7$. Kummer showed that the class number is the product of two factors $h^-$ and $h^+$, and gave a simple formula for $h^-$. Using this result it is easy to show that $h^- = 1$ for $p < 23$. Showing that the factor $h^+$ is trivial is much more difficult. You can get an idea of the difficulty by consulting Schoof's calculations in the appendix of the 2nd edition of Washington's book.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the user wants to know how to prove that the ring of integers ℤ[ζₚ] doesn't have unique factorization when p=23 but does for p<23. Hmm, I remember that Kummer was involved in this, right? He found that unique factorization fails for certain primes, which are called irregular primes. But wait, how exactly does that relate to p=23?\n\nFirst, I need to recall what ℤ[ζₚ] is. That's the ring of cyclotomic integers, generated by a primitive p-th root of unity, ζₚ. The unique factorization of ideals in these rings relates to the class number. If the class number is 1, then the ring has unique factorization. But for primes where the class number is greater than 1, unique factorization fails. So, Kummer probably showed that for p=23, the class number isn't 1, whereas for primes less than 23, it is.\n\nBut wait, isn't it known which primes are regular (i.e., have class number not divisible by p)? Kummer's criterion for regularity involves that p doesn't divide the numerators of certain Bernoulli numbers. The primes less than 23 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Let me check which of these are regular. I think primes less than 23 are all regular except maybe 23 itself? Wait, 23 is the first irregular prime. So, for p=23, the class number is not 1, hence unique factorization fails. But how to prove this specifically?\n\nMaybe the approach is to show that for p=23, there's an element that can be factored in two different ways, breaking unique factorization. Alternatively, use Kummer's criterion involving Bernoulli numbers. The Bernoulli number B_2 is 1/6, B_4=-1/30, B_6=1/42, etc. The numerators of these Bernoulli numbers up to B_p-3 might be the key. For p=23, check if 23 divides the numerator of any Bernoulli number B_2, B_4, ..., B_{20} (since p-3=20). If it does, then 23 is irregular.\n\nLooking up Bernoulli numbers, the numerator of B_20 is -174611/330. So, 174611. Let me divide 174611 by 23. 23*7590=174570, so 174611-174570=41. So 23 doesn't divide 174611. Wait, maybe another Bernoulli number? Let's see B_16 is -3617/510. 3617 divided by 23: 23*157=3611, remainder 6. So no. B_18 is 43867/798. 43867 divided by 23: 23*1900=43700, 43867-43700=167. 167/23=7*23=161, remainder 6. Not divisible. B_14 is 7/6. No. B_12 is -691/2730. 691 divided by 23: 23*30=690, remainder 1. So no. B_10 is 5/66. B_8 is -1/30. B_6=1/42. B_4=-1/30. B_2=1/6. Wait, maybe I need to check higher indices. Wait, Kummer's criterion says that a prime p is regular if it doesn't divide the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers B_2, B_4, ..., B_{p-3}. So for p=23, we check up to B_{20}. But earlier ones didn't work. Wait, maybe B_22? But p-3=20. So up to B_{20}. Then if none are divisible by 23, then p=23 is regular? But that contradicts the original problem's assertion. Wait, maybe I got the indices wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, Kummer's criterion for irregular primes: p divides the numerator of B_{2k} for some k from 1 to (p-3)/2. For p=23, (p-3)/2=10, so check B_2, B_4, ..., B_{20}. But according to the calculations above, none of those numerators are divisible by 23. But this contradicts the fact that 23 is an irregular prime. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the Bernoulli numbers. Let me verify B_16. B_16 is indeed -3617/510. Numerator is -3617. 23*157=3611, so 3617-3611=6, so 3617=23*157 +6, so 23 doesn't divide it. B_20: numerator is -174611. Let's divide 174611 by 23 again. 23*7000=161000. 174611-161000=13611. 23*500=11500, 13611-11500=2111. 23*90=2070, 2111-2070=41. So 23*7590=174570, remainder 41. Not divisible. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check B_{22}? But according to Kummer's criterion, the indices go up to p-3. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check a reference. Oh, wait, Kummer's original criterion states that a prime p is irregular if p divides the class number of ℚ(ζ_p), which he related to the Bernoulli numbers. The exact criterion is that p is irregular if and only if p divides the numerator of at least one of the Bernoulli numbers B_2, B_4, ..., B_{p-3}. For p=23, that would be B_2 to B_{20}. But according to my calculations, none of these numerators are divisible by 23. However, I know that 23 is actually an irregular prime. So maybe I'm making a mistake in the Bernoulli numbers. Let me check B_{16} again. Wait, B_{16} is -3617/510. Wait, 3617 divided by 23: 23*157=3611, remainder 6. So not divisible. B_{18} is 43867/798. 43867 divided by 23: 23*1900=43700, 43867-43700=167. 23*7=161, 167-161=6. So remainder 6. Not divisible. B_{20} is -174611/330. 174611 divided by 23 gives remainder 41 as above. Hmm. So none are divisible by 23. But 23 is actually an irregular prime. Wait, this must mean that my Bernoulli numbers are incorrect. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking up Bernoulli numbers on the OEIS or a reliable source. The Bernoulli number B_20 is -174611/330. The numerator is 174611. Let's check divisibility by 23: 23 times 7590 is 174570. 174611 minus 174570 is 41, so not divisible. B_22 is 854513/138. Numerator is 854513. Divide by 23: 23*37150=854,450. 854513-854450=63. 63/23=2*23=46, remainder 17. Not divisible. Wait, but 23 is supposed to be irregular. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding. Let me check the list of irregular primes. The first few irregular primes are 37, 59, 67, etc. Wait, wait, 23 is actually a regular prime. So maybe the original problem is incorrect? Wait, the problem states that Kummer proved in 1844 that when p=23, ℤ[ζ_p] does not have unique factorization. But according to the list of irregular primes, 23 is a regular prime. That's conflicting. So maybe the problem is incorrect? Or maybe Kummer's objection was about something else.\n\nWait, the original question says \"Kummer proved that when p=23 we do not have unique factorization\". But according to historical accounts, Kummer showed that unique factorization fails for p=23, but that was a mistake. Wait, no. Wait, the history is that Lamé thought he had a proof for FLT using unique factorization in ℤ[ζ_p], but Kummer pointed out that unique factorization doesn't hold in general, and he had already shown in 1844 that for p=23, the ring doesn't have unique factorization. But according to later classifications, 23 is regular. Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check the class number of ℚ(ζ₂₃). If the class number is 1, then unique factorization holds. If it's greater than 1, then it doesn't. But I thought that for regular primes, the class number is not divisible by p, but the class number itself might still be greater than 1. Wait, Kummer's result is that if p is regular, then p doesn't divide the class number, but the class number could still be composite. For example, for p=23, even if it's regular, the class number might be greater than 1, leading to non-unique factorization.\n\nWait, but regular primes are primes where p does not divide the class number of the cyclotomic field. So, if p is regular, the class number might still be greater than 1, but not divisible by p. In that case, the ring ℤ[ζ_p] would have unique factorization only if the class number is 1. So even if p is regular, if the class number is greater than 1, unique factorization fails. However, for cyclotomic fields, the class number being 1 is rare. For example, for p=23, the class number is 3, which is prime to 23, so p=23 is regular, but since the class number is 3≠1, unique factorization fails. Whereas for primes less than 23, maybe their class numbers are 1, so unique factorization holds. But wait, does that hold?\n\nWait, let me check known class numbers. For example, the class number of ℚ(ζ_p) for p prime. For p=5, the class number is 1. For p=7, 1. For p=11, 1. For p=13, 1. For p=17, 1. For p=19, 1. For p=23, class number is 3. So yes, for primes less than 23, the class numbers are 1, hence unique factorization holds. But at p=23, the class number becomes 3, so unique factorization fails. So the answer is that for p <23, the class number is 1, hence ℤ[ζ_p] is a UFD, but for p=23, the class number is 3, hence not a UFD. Therefore, the problem reduces to computing the class numbers. However, proving that the class number is 1 for p <23 and 3 for p=23 requires some deep number theory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more elementary way for specific primes. For example, Kummer might have shown for p=23 that there's a specific factorization that isn't unique. But I don't recall the exact example. However, historically, Kummer's result was that the cyclotomic integers don't have unique factorization for certain primes, which he called irregular, but maybe he specifically showed it for p=23. But according to more modern classifications, p=23 is regular but has class number 3. So perhaps the original problem conflates regularity with class number 1? Maybe the problem's premise is that unique factorization holds if and only if the class number is 1, which is true. Thus, the answer would involve showing that for p <23, the class number of ℚ(ζ_p) is 1, and for p=23, it's 3. But how to prove that?\n\nThis is quite advanced. Maybe using Kummer's criterion for class numbers or using the analytic class number formula. But for someone asking on Math Stack Exchange, they might want a reference or a sketch. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the exponents of the class group. However, this seems quite involved. In summary, the key assumptions are about the class numbers of cyclotomic fields for primes p and p=23 specifically. The problem is to prove that ℤ[ζ_p] has unique factorization (UFD) for p <23 but not for p=23. The answer involves class numbers, showing they are 1 for p <23 and greater than 1 for p=23, hence UFD fails.",
