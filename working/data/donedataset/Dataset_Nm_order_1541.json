    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, then state the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is about zeta sums, specifically the sum from n=1 to infinity of [zeta(5n)-1] and others. The question mentions for p=2, the sum equals 3/4, and suggests a general form for odd p, using p=5 as an example. They define z_5 as e^(πi/5) and present an expression involving the digamma function ψ and Euler-Mascheroni constant γ. The user is asking how to prove or disprove this, and also how to split ψ(e^(πi/p)) into real and imaginary parts.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem seems to make several assumptions here. Let me list them one by one. \n\n1. The variable p is an odd integer. The example given is p=5, but the question mentions a general form for odd p, so this is an assumption.\n2. For p=5, z_5 is defined as e^(πi/5). So, each assumption should be about one object. So, z_5 is defined as that complex number.\n3. The sum in question is over n=1 to infinity of [ζ(pn) - 1], which applies to the general case for odd p.\n4. The problem uses the digamma function ψ and Euler-Mascheroni constant γ in the expression. So another assumption is the use of these functions and constants.\n5. The user also asks about splitting ψ(e^(πi/p)) into real and imaginary parts. So that's another part of the problem.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions that were specific to the problem's conditions. For instance, in the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, I need to list the conditions given in the problem. Let me re-examine.\n\nOriginal problem says: For p=2, sum is 3/4. It seems there's a general form for odd p. For p=5, defines z_5 = e^(πi/5), then gives an expression. The problem is to prove/disprove this, and to split ψ(e^(πi/p)) into real and imaginary parts.\n\nSo assumptions would be:\n\n- p is an odd integer.\n- For p=5, z_5 = e^{πi/5}.\n- The sum considered is ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1].\n- The expression involves γ (Euler-Mascheroni constant) and ψ (digamma function).\n- The expression for p=5 is given as 5∑... = 6 + γ + terms with ψ.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nz_5 is defined as e^{πi/5},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(5n) - 1] is considered.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions the sum for general odd p, but the specific example is for p=5. The problem statement is about both the general case for odd p and the specific case for p=5. The user is asking two things: prove/disprove the general form for odd p (with the example given for p=5), and how to split the digamma function into real and imaginary parts.\n\nHmm, perhaps the assumptions need to capture the conditions for the problem. Let me try:\n\nAssumptions:\np is an odd integer,\nz_p = e^{πi/p} (but in the problem, they defined z_5 for p=5, so maybe in general z_p is defined as e^{πi/p} for odd p),\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nBut the problem specifically uses p=5 in the example. Wait, maybe for the specific case of p=5, the assumption is that z_5 = e^{πi/5}. Then the problem is about both general odd p and the specific case with p=5. However, the user's example had assumptions that were specific to the problem's conditions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor p=5, z_5 is defined as e^{πi/5},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nBut the problem statement also includes that for p=2, the sum is 3/4. However, since the user is focusing on odd p, maybe the assumption is that p is odd, and the question is about generalizing to odd p. The user is asking to prove or disprove the general form for odd p, using the p=5 case as an example. Then, the second part is about splitting ψ(e^{πi/p}) into real and imaginary parts.\n\nSo the problem is two-fold: first, prove/disprove the expression for odd p (with the p=5 example), and second, how to express ψ(e^{πi/p}) in real terms.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor each odd p, z_p is defined as e^{πi/p},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nBut in the example given, they used z_5 for p=5. Maybe the problem is specifically about p=5, but also general odd p. The problem statement says \"for p=5\" then asks \"how do we split ψ(e^{πi/p})...\", so maybe the p is a general odd integer here.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could have two parts: one about the sum for odd p, and another about splitting ψ(e^{πi/p}) into real and imaginary parts. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\np is an odd integer,\nz_p is defined as e^{πi/p},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nThen, the problem is two-part: 1) prove/disprove the expression for odd p, and 2) split ψ(e^{πi/p}) into real and imaginary parts.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption was a single condition. So here, each line should be a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nz_p is defined as e^{πi/p} for each odd p,\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nBut maybe the problem specifically mentions p=5, so:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor p=5, z_5 is defined as e^{πi/5},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered for odd p.\n\nBut the user wants each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"p is an odd integer\" is one condition. Then, for p=5, z_5 is defined as e^{πi/5} is another. Then, γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, which is a separate assumption. Similarly, ψ is the digamma function. Then the sum being considered is another assumption.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more about the sum in general for odd p, with an example at p=5. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor each odd p, z_p is defined as e^{πi/p},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nBut the example given in the problem for p=5 defines z_5 as e^{πi/5}, so perhaps the assumption is specific to p=5. But the user is asking about general odd p as well. Hmm. This is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have two parts: one related to the sum for odd p, and another related to splitting the digamma function. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor each odd p, z_p is defined as e^{πi/p},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for odd p, the sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] can be expressed in terms of γ and ψ(z_p) as shown in the example for p=5, and express ψ(e^{πi/p}) in terms of real and imaginary parts.\n\nBut the original problem states for p=5, the sum multiplied by 5 equals that expression. So maybe the problem is to show that for an odd p, the sum has a certain form involving γ and ψ(z_p), and to split ψ(z_p) into real and imaginary parts.\n\nWait, the problem as given in the question is:\n\n\"Anyone knows how to prove/disprove this? Also, how do we split ψ(e^{\\pi i/p}) into its real and imaginary parts so as to express the above purely in real terms?\"\n\nSo the two questions are:\n\n1. Prove or disprove that for odd p (exemplified by p=5), the sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn)-1] equals the given expression involving γ and ψ.\n\n2. Split ψ(e^{πi/p}) into real and imaginary parts to express the sum purely in real terms.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor each odd p, z_p = e^{πi/p},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn)-1] is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for odd p, the sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn)-1] can be expressed in terms of γ and ψ(z_p), and split ψ(e^{πi/p}) into real and imaginary parts to express the sum purely in real terms.\n\nBut the example in the problem specifically uses p=5 and z_5, so perhaps the assumptions should include the definition for z_5 when p=5. However, the user's example formatted problem extracted the specific condition (n divisible by 7) even though the original problem was about all integers n. But in that case, the user had an error perhaps, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem says: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem under Assumption says: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", meaning no restriction, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. However, the user provided that as an example. So maybe in their format, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they added an assumption. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the example was a bad one, but according to the user's instruction, the example is theirs. So perhaps in their example, they mistakenly added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in reality, the original problem didn't have that.\n\nBut regardless, the user wants us to follow their format. So for the current problem, perhaps I should list the assumptions as:\n\n- p is an odd integer.\n- For p=5, z_5 = e^{πi/5}.\n- γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n- ψ is the digamma function.\n- The sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nThen the problem is:\n\nProve or disprove that for odd p (exemplified by p=5), 5∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(5n) -1] equals 6 + γ + z_5^{-1}ψ(z_5^{-1}) + z_5ψ(z_5) + z_5^{-3}ψ(z_5^{-3}) + z_5^{3}ψ(z_5^{3}), and express ψ(e^{πi/p}) in real terms.\n\nBut the problem in the original question is two parts: proving/disproving the expression for p=5 and the general case for odd p, and splitting ψ(e^{πi/p}) into real and imaginary parts.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to separate into two problems? But the user wants the problem structured as per the format. Let's try.\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor each odd p, z_p = e^{πi/p},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for odd p, the sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] can be expressed in terms of γ and ψ(z_p), and express ψ(e^{πi/p}) in terms of real and imaginary parts to write the sum purely in real terms.\n\nBut the example given by the user had specific assumptions for a specific case. Maybe here, since the problem includes both the general case and a specific case (p=5), the assumptions should list both the general and specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about p=5, and the general case for odd p is part of the problem statement. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"For p = 2, we have, [sum equals] 3/4. It seems there is a general form for odd p. For example, for p = 5, define z_5 = e^{π i/5}. Then, [expression]. Anyone knows how to prove/disprove this? Also, how do we split ψ(e^{π i/p}) into its real and imaginary parts...\"\n\nSo the user is asking to prove/disprove the existence of a general form for odd p (exemplified by p=5), and how to split ψ(e^{πi/p}) into real and imaginary parts. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor each odd p, z_p = e^{πi/p},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for odd integers p, the sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] can be expressed as a combination of γ and ψ(z_p), as shown for p=5, and split ψ(e^{πi/p}) into real and imaginary parts to express the sum purely in real terms.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement might need to mention the specific example for p=5. So the problem could be: For odd primes p, such as p=5, prove that the sum... etc.\n\nBut in the original problem, they just say \"for p=2\" and \"for p=5\". It's not specified if p must be prime. Wait, the problem mentions p=2 (which is prime) and p=5 (also prime). However, the user hasn't specified p as prime, just odd. So the assumption is p is an odd integer.\n\nThus, after considering all this, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor each odd p, z_p is defined as e^{πi/p},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for odd p, the sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] can be expressed in terms of γ and ψ(z_p) as demonstrated for p=5, and split ψ(e^{πi/p}) into real and imaginary parts to express the sum purely in real terms.\n\nBut maybe the problem for p=5 is a specific case, so the assumptions should include that z_5 is defined as e^{πi/5}. Then:\n\nAssumption:\np is an odd integer,\nFor p=5, z_5 is defined as e^{πi/5},\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nψ is the digamma function,\nThe sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that for odd p (exemplified by p=5), the sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(pn) - 1] can be expressed in terms of γ and ψ(z_p), and express ψ(e^{πi/p}) in real and imaginary parts to write the sum in real terms.\n\nI think this captures the problem's assumptions and the two parts of the question. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. The problem is to prove/disprove the expression for odd p (with p=5 example) and split the digamma function into real/imaginary parts.",
