    "Content": "Because the straight forward approach involves Fresnel integrals I thought about a different approach of taking the imaginary part of \n$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\exp{(ix^2)} \\, dx $ but have no idea how to continue.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to integrate sin(x²) from negative infinity to positive infinity. The straightforward method uses Fresnel integrals, but they're trying a different approach by considering the imaginary part of the integral of exp(ix²) dx over the same interval. \n\nFirst, I remember that the integral of exp(-x²) dx from -∞ to ∞ is sqrt(π). But here we have exp(ix²) instead. The user mentions taking the imaginary part, so maybe converting the integral into a complex plane problem would help. \n\nWait, the integral of exp(ix²) is related to Fresnel integrals. The Fresnel integrals involve integrating sin(x²) and cos(x²), which both evaluate to sqrt(π/8) when integrated from 0 to ∞. But the user is suggesting a different method by considering the complex plane. \n\nThey propose that the value sqrt(π) is \"divided\" over the complex plane's quadrants. Hmm, maybe using contour integration? If we consider a contour in the complex plane, perhaps a sector from 0 to some angle where the integral can be evaluated. Since exp(ix²) is entire (analytic everywhere), maybe using Cauchy's theorem. \n\nThe standard contour for such integrals is a sector with angle π/4 because substituting z = x * exp(iπ/4) would convert ix² into -r², turning the integral into a Gaussian form. Let's see: Let z = e^(iπ/4) * x, then dz = e^(iπ/4) dx. Then, the integral becomes ∫ exp(i (e^(iπ/4) x)^2) * e^(iπ/4) dx from 0 to ∞. Let's compute the exponent: i*(e^(iπ/4))² x² = i*(e^(iπ/2)) x² = i*(i) x² = -x². So the integral becomes e^(iπ/4) ∫ exp(-x²) dx from 0 to ∞. That gives e^(iπ/4) * sqrt(π)/2. Then, multiplying by 2 for the entire real line, we get e^(iπ/4) * sqrt(π). Taking the imaginary part would give sqrt(π) * sin(π/4) = sqrt(π) * sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(π/2). \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned the result sqrt(π/2) - i sqrt(π/2). That seems to come from evaluating the integral over the contour and equating the real and imaginary parts. However, the integral of exp(ix²) from -∞ to ∞ is sqrt(π) * e^(iπ/4), which is sqrt(π/2) + i sqrt(π/2). Taking the imaginary part would then give sqrt(π/2), which matches the known value of the Fresnel integral. \n\nSo maybe the user is confused about splitting the sqrt(π) into parts over quadrants. The key idea is using contour integration and rotating the path of integration by 45 degrees to relate it to the Gaussian integral. That justifies the result. Therefore, the problem is about justifying the integral of sin(x²) using contour integration methods and explaining how the Gaussian result distributes over the complex plane.",
