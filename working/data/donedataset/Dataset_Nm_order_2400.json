    "Content": "I am trying to prove that every non-unit of a ring is contained in some maximal ideal. I have reasoned as follows: let $a$ be a non-unit and $M$ a maximal ideal. If $a$ is not contained in any maximal ideal, then the ideal $\\langle M, a \\rangle$ (that is, the ideal generated by $M$ and $a$) strictly contains $M$, a contradiction. However, there is a detail I'm unsure about. It's easy to see that $\\langle a \\rangle$ is a proper ideal for any non-unit $a$, but how can I be sure that $\\langle M,a \\rangle$ is also a proper ideal? Couldn't there, for example, exist some $m \\in M$ such that $1=m+a$, so that $\\langle M,a \\rangle$ is the whole ring?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a$ non-unit. Consider the ideal $\\langle a \\rangle$. Since $a$ is not a unit this ideal does not contain $1$ so it is not the full ring $R$. Now, let's look at the ideals of $R$ that are not equal to $R$. In particular, $\\langle a \\rangle$ is one of them. The question is whether $\\langle a \\rangle $ can be enlarged to an ideal again not $R$ which itself cannot be enlarged any further. OK, if $\\langle a \\rangle$ itself cannot be enlarged any further, done, it is maximal. If not, then it can be enlarged to say some ideal $I_1$. If $I_1$ is maximal, done. If not, enlarge it to $I_2$. If $I_2$ is maximal, done. \nIf not, enlarge it to $I_3$, and so on. What can happen: one obtains at some point an ideal $I_n$ that is maximal. Done one never stops, and we get $$\\langle a \\rangle \\subset I_1 \\subset I_2 \\subset I_3 \\subset \\ldots $$\nstrict inclusions. Now one can argue that in a lot of commonly met rings this can never happen. This is true, it can never happen in a quite large family of rings, called noetherian. But still, in principle one can go on for ever like this. What to do? Let's look at the union of all the $I_n$. It is an ideal itself, and moreover, it is not $R$. Why? I mean in principle it may just be possible that they exhaust $R$. But, attention. None of the $I_n$ contain the element $1$. This is the key. It follows that the union also does not contain $1$ and hence we got an even bigger ideal, still not $R$. If this is maximal, now we are done. What if not? Well, we should just keep on going and increasing at each step to a large one if we haven't yet reached a maximal. OK, one should be careful: how many steps can we perform? Already we have performed something like countably infinitely many. Well, is there a possibility to keep on going for ever? Certainly one cannot just go on forever in this extended sense, when the number of steps can be labelled by any $\\it{well\\  ordered \\ set}$. Well, this is the content of a tricky method called the Zorn lemma. I will end now by saying that at some (perhaps very far away) point the procedure will stop and we will get our maximal ideal containing $\\langle a \\rangle$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is trying to prove that every non-unit in a ring is contained in some maximal ideal. Their approach is to assume the opposite: suppose there's a non-unit 'a' not contained in any maximal ideal. Then, take a maximal ideal M. Since 'a' isn't in M, the ideal generated by M and 'a', denoted ⟨M, a⟩, should strictly contain M. But since M is maximal, ⟨M, a⟩ must be the entire ring, leading to a contradiction.\n\nBut the user is unsure about why ⟨M, a⟩ is a proper ideal. They worry that maybe there's some m in M such that 1 = m + a, which would make ⟨M, a⟩ the whole ring, but does that affect the argument?\n\nWait, the original argument is that if 'a' isn't in any maximal ideal, then for every maximal ideal M, ⟨M, a⟩ would have to be the entire ring. But if that's the case, then 1 is in ⟨M, a⟩, so there exist elements m in M and r in the ring such that 1 = m + ra. But if that's true for every maximal ideal M, does that lead to a contradiction?\n\nHold on, maybe the key here is to use the fact that if 'a' is a non-unit, then the ideal ⟨a⟩ is proper. So, ⟨a⟩ is contained in some maximal ideal by Zorn's lemma. But the user is trying to argue without invoking Zorn's lemma? Or maybe the ring is assumed to have maximal ideals, which requires the ring to be unital and perhaps satisfy some conditions like being commutative?\n\nWait, the problem statement just says \"a ring\". Usually, in ring theory, rings are assumed to be commutative with unity unless stated otherwise. So assuming the ring has a unity element. Then every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal, by Zorn's lemma. So the standard proof is that if 'a' is a non-unit, then ⟨a⟩ is a proper ideal, hence contained in a maximal ideal, so 'a' is in that maximal ideal.\n\nBut the user's approach is slightly different. They are trying to argue by contradiction: suppose 'a' is not in any maximal ideal. Then take any maximal ideal M. Since 'a' is not in M, then ⟨M, a⟩ is strictly larger than M, hence must be the whole ring. Therefore, 1 is in ⟨M, a⟩. So 1 = m + ra for some m in M and r in R. But since M is maximal, and hence a proper ideal, this seems like a problem. But how does this lead to a contradiction?\n\nWait, if every maximal ideal M has 1 = m + ra, then perhaps 'a' would be a unit? Because if 1 = ra + m, then ra = 1 - m. But if m is in M, which is a proper ideal, so 1 - m is a unit because if 1 - m were not a unit, then it would be contained in a maximal ideal, but 1 - m is congruent to 1 modulo M, so it's invertible. Hence, ra is a unit, so 'a' is a unit. But the original assumption is that 'a' is a non-unit. Hence, contradiction.\n\nSo the user's approach is valid. The key point is that if ⟨M, a⟩ is the entire ring, then 1 can be expressed as m + ra, which implies that 'a' is a unit, contradicting the assumption that 'a' is a non-unit. Therefore, such an M cannot exist, which would mean that 'a' must be contained in some maximal ideal.\n\nBut the user is concerned about the step where they assume that ⟨M, a⟩ is proper. Actually, in their argument, they are saying that if 'a' is not in any maximal ideal, then for every maximal ideal M, ⟨M, a⟩ is the entire ring. Therefore, each maximal ideal M would have 1 ∈ ⟨M, a⟩. But then, as above, this would make 'a' a unit. Therefore, the assumption that 'a' is not in any maximal ideal leads to 'a' being a unit, contradicting the initial condition. Therefore, such an 'a' must be in some maximal ideal.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about whether ⟨M, a⟩ could be the entire ring, which would mean that 1 is in it, and they are worried that this might not lead to a contradiction. However, the contradiction arises precisely because if 1 is in ⟨M, a⟩, then 'a' is a unit, which contradicts 'a' being a non-unit. So the user's original reasoning is correct, but they need to make sure that the step where they derive that 1 ∈ ⟨M, a⟩ leading to 'a' being a unit is valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the confusion comes from the fact that they have to consider all maximal ideals. If for every maximal ideal M, ⟨M, a⟩ = R, then that would imply that 'a' is a unit. Because if you take M to be any maximal ideal, and then in each case, you can write 1 as m + ra, then 'a' would have a right inverse in R. But in a commutative ring, having a right inverse makes 'a' a unit. However, in a non-commutative ring, a right inverse might not be a left inverse. But the problem didn't specify commutative. Hmm, this might be an issue.\n\nWait, the original problem statement just says \"a ring\". If the ring is not commutative, then the argument might not hold. Because 'a' could have a right inverse but not a left inverse, hence not being a unit. So in that case, the user's argument might fail. However, if the ring is commutative, then any right inverse is a two-sided inverse, so 'a' would be a unit.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions might need to include that the ring is commutative with unity. Since in the standard proof, we do require the ring to have unity and to be commutative to ensure that every non-unit is contained in a maximal ideal. Otherwise, in non-commutative rings, the existence of maximal ideals is more complicated, and the notion of units is different.\n\nBut the user's question didn't specify the ring is commutative. So perhaps the problem is assuming the ring is commutative with unity. Therefore, the user's approach is valid under that assumption. So the step where they get 1 = m + ra leads to 'a' being a unit, hence the contradiction. Therefore, the user's reasoning is correct provided the ring is commutative with 1.\n\nBut the user's question is about how to be sure that ⟨M, a⟩ is a proper ideal. Wait, in their argument, they don't need ⟨M, a⟩ to be proper. They are arguing by contradiction: assuming 'a' is not in any maximal ideal, then for any maximal ideal M, ⟨M, a⟩ must be the entire ring (since M is maximal and ⟨M, a⟩ strictly contains M). Then, since ⟨M, a⟩ = R, 1 is in ⟨M, a⟩, which gives 1 = m + ra. Therefore, ra = 1 - m. Since m is in M, which is a proper ideal, 1 - m is a unit (because if 1 - m were in a maximal ideal, then 1 would be in that ideal, which is impossible). Therefore, ra is a unit, so 'a' is a unit, contradicting the assumption that 'a' is a non-unit. Therefore, the initial assumption that 'a' is not in any maximal ideal must be false.\n\nSo the key points here are:\n\n1. The ring has unity.\n2. The ring is commutative (to ensure that the existence of a right inverse makes 'a' a unit).\n3. Maximal ideals exist, which in rings with unity is guaranteed by Zorn's lemma.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions needed are that R is a commutative ring with unity, and 'a' is a non-unit in R. The problem is to prove that 'a' is contained in some maximal ideal.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify these assumptions. So when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions:\n\n- R is a commutative ring.\n- R has a multiplicative identity (unity).\n- a is a non-unit element in R.\n- Every proper ideal in R is contained in a maximal ideal (which follows from Zorn's lemma if R has unity).\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions here are that R is a commutative ring with unity, and a is a non-unit. The problem then is to prove that a is contained in some maximal ideal.\n\nLooking back at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\nR has a multiplicative identity,\na is an element of R,\na is a non-unit in R.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a is contained in some maximal ideal.\n\nBut the user's original question mentions \"the ideal generated by M and a\" and worries about whether ⟨M, a⟩ could be the entire ring. So in the problem statement, perhaps the specific step they're questioning is whether ⟨M, a⟩ is proper, but in the argument, the contradiction arises because ⟨M, a⟩ cannot be proper if M is maximal and a is not in M. Therefore, the problem is to prove that every non-unit is contained in some maximal ideal, given that R is a commutative ring with unity.\n\nThus, structuring the problem would involve listing these assumptions.",
