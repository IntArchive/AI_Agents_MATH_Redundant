    "Content": "If so, how might I be able to prove it? EDIT: OK, thanks to many answers especially spin's and Micah's explanations. All of the answers were extremely helpful in understanding -- I have accepted Micah's because it seems the most complete, but all answers provide helpful additions/perspectives! I have tried to summarize: $\\phi$ is an isomorphism between the groups if and only if $\\phi(x) = e^{f(x)}$ where $f$ is an isomorphism from $(\\mathbb{R},+)$ back to $(\\mathbb{R},+)$. Of course there are lots of such $f$, especially when we take the Axiom of Choice. However, it seems from the answers and Micah's link ( Cauchy functional equation ) that the only \"nice\" solutions are $f(x) = cx$ for a constant $c$. It seems that all others must be \"highly pathological\" (in fact $\\{(x,f(x))\\}$ must be dense in $\\mathbb{R}^2$). A remaining question is, how strong is the statement All such isomorphisms have the form $e^{cx}$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or its negation? Or what is required for each to hold? One answer seems to be that supposing the reals have the Baire property is sufficient to rule out other solutions (as is assuming every subset of the reals is measurable, assuming the Axiom of Determinacy , and it holds in Solovay's model ). For more, see this question , this question , and this mathoverflow question .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}^+$ be an isomorphism. Then $g=\\log f$ is an automorphism of $(\\mathbb{R}, +)$: that is, it satisfies\n$$\ng(x+y)=g(x)+g(y) \\, .\n$$\nThis is Cauchy's functional equation . The only continuous (or even measurable) solutions are the trivial ones (which correspond to $f(x)=e^{cx}$), but there are also exotic solutions that require some version of the axiom of choice to construct — which would yield similarly exotic $f$s.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem. The user is asking if the exponential function is the only isomorphism between the additive group of real numbers and the multiplicative group of positive real numbers. They also mention something about needing to prove it and discuss other possible isomorphisms that might exist, especially under different mathematical axioms like the Axiom of Choice.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core assumptions. The problem is about group isomorphisms between (ℝ, +) and (ℝ>0, *). The main question is whether every such isomorphism must be of the form e^{cx} for some constant c. The original question also references that without certain axioms, there might be other \"pathological\" solutions, but under standard conditions with some regularity (like continuity), e^x is the only one.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are that we're dealing with group isomorphisms. The groups in question are the real numbers under addition and the positive real numbers under multiplication. The user wants to know if the exponential function is the unique isomorphism between them. The edited part of the question mentions that if you have an isomorphism φ, then it must be of the form e^{f(x)} where f is an isomorphism from (ℝ, +) to itself. Then, unless f is linear (f(x) = cx), these can be pathological, but under certain conditions (like assuming continuity), f must be linear, leading to φ(x) = e^{cx}.\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated in the title is whether e^x is the only isomorphism. The answer seems to be no without additional constraints because you can compose e^x with any additive isomorphism of ℝ, which can be non-linear if you don't require continuity. But the user is asking for the problem structure, so the assumptions need to be extracted from the original question.\n\nLooking at the original problem statement, the user is asking if e^x is the only isomorphism. The assumptions here would be that we have two groups: (ℝ, +) and (ℝ>0, *). The problem is to determine if every group isomorphism between them must be of the form e^{cx} for some real number c.\n\nHowever, the user's edit clarifies that without extra conditions, there are other isomorphisms if you accept non-continuous ones via the Axiom of Choice. So, perhaps the assumptions needed are the standard ones where we require the isomorphism to be continuous or some other regularity condition. But the original question doesn't state these; the user is asking if e^x is the only one, and the answer depends on whether you impose such conditions.\n\nWait, the problem as posed in the title is: \"Is e^x the only isomorphism between the groups (ℝ, +) and (ℝ>0, *)?\" So the core assumptions are that we're considering group isomorphisms between these two groups. The problem is to prove whether e^x is the only such isomorphism. However, as the user's edit notes, the answer is that it's not the only one unless you impose additional conditions like continuity. But the problem might be structured under the assumption of some regularity condition, but the original question doesn't specify that. So perhaps the problem is to show that e^x is the only continuous isomorphism, or the only measurable one, etc. But the original problem as stated in the title doesn't specify that; it's a general question. However, the user's edit mentions that without the Axiom of Choice, or with certain regularity conditions, the answer is different. So maybe the assumptions here are implicit in the problem as posed on Math Stack Exchange. But the user wants me to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So, in that case, the assumptions were explicit in the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is whether e^x is the only isomorphism. The assumptions here would be that we're working within the category of groups, so the isomorphisms are purely group-theoretic, without any topological considerations. But in that case, the answer is no, because you can compose e^x with any automorphism of (ℝ, +), which can be non-continuous. However, if you require continuity, then e^x is the only one up to scaling. So, perhaps the problem as posed is ambiguous unless additional assumptions are made. But the user's edit mentions that under certain conditions (like assuming the function is measurable or has the Baire property), the only solutions are exponential functions. So the problem might be to show that e^x is the only continuous isomorphism, but the original problem didn't specify continuity. Therefore, the problem as stated in the title is actually a no, but if you add regularity conditions, it becomes yes.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, the user wants to list the assumptions. Since the original problem doesn't mention any constraints like continuity, but the user's edit and the answers refer to them, perhaps the problem is to show that e^x is the only continuous isomorphism, which would require adding the continuity assumption. However, the title question is general. So maybe the correct approach is to note that without additional assumptions, there are multiple isomorphisms, but with continuity, it's unique. However, the example given by the user in the original question had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem statement. So perhaps in this case, the problem as posed is to determine if e^x is the only isomorphism, with the assumption that we're considering group isomorphisms (without any topological constraints). But in that case, the answer is no. However, the problem might be intended to ask under what conditions e^x is the only isomorphism, but the original title doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that e^x is the only continuous isomorphism. But the title question is more general. The user's edit clarifies that when they accepted an answer, it was under the condition that the function is \"nice\", i.e., continuous. So perhaps the actual problem, when structured, should include the assumption of continuity. But the original problem title doesn't mention that. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are that we're dealing with a group isomorphism between (ℝ, +) and (ℝ>0, *), and the problem is to determine if it's necessarily of the form e^{cx}. However, given the user's edit, they're aware that without extra conditions, there are other solutions, so maybe the problem as posed in the answer is assuming some regularity, like continuity. But the original question doesn't state that. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, maybe the assumptions are that the isomorphism is continuous, or measurable, etc. But the original problem statement in the title doesn't include that. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original question's title is: \"Is e^x the only isomorphism between the groups (ℝ, +) and (ℝ>0, *)?\" So strictly speaking, the problem is asking if e^x is the only group isomorphism, without any additional constraints. The answer would be no, because you can compose e^x with any discontinuous automorphism of (ℝ, +). However, if you impose continuity, then yes, e^x (or its scalar multiples) are the only ones. Therefore, perhaps the problem as stated is missing an assumption, but the user's edit and the answers clarify that. However, when structuring the problem, we need to capture the assumptions from the original problem. The original problem didn't state any assumptions beyond the group structure. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to determine if e^x is the only isomorphism without additional constraints, but the answer is no. However, the user might have intended to ask under the assumption of continuity. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is as stated, but the answer requires adding assumptions.\n\nBut according to the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove it for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean the assumption is just that n is an integer. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Unless maybe the original problem had a typo or the example was misformatted.\n\nWait, looking back: the user's example original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems wrong. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean the assumption is n is any integer. But the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That contradicts. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I have to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem as per the given example, which in this case, despite the possible error, includes extracting assumptions from the problem. So perhaps the task is to list all the assumptions inherent in the problem, even if they're not explicitly stated but necessary for the problem to hold. But in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's conflicting. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake, but regardless, I need to follow their format.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is whether e^x is the only isomorphism between the two groups. The answer depends on whether we require the isomorphism to be continuous. The problem as stated in the title doesn't specify, but the user's edit mentions that without Choice, or with certain conditions, it's unique. Therefore, to structure the problem, perhaps the assumptions should include that the isomorphism is continuous, or measurable, or something else. But since the original problem didn't state that, maybe the problem is to show that e^x is the only isomorphism without additional assumptions, which is false. Therefore, perhaps the problem as intended by the user is under the assumption of continuity. But since the title doesn't specify, I'm in a quandary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to determine if e^x is the only isomorphism, and the answer is no, but if you add certain conditions, then yes. However, according to the user's example, assumptions are listed line by line. So in the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The groups in question are (ℝ, +) and (ℝ>0, *).\n2. We are considering group isomorphisms between them.\n3. The isomorphism is a continuous function. (But this isn't stated in the original problem; it's inferred from the answer discussion.)\n\nBut since the original problem doesn't mention continuity, perhaps the assumption is that we're in ZFC without any restrictions, allowing for non-measurable functions. However, in that case, the answer is no, there are other isomorphisms. But the user's edit says that all isomorphisms have the form e^{f(x)} where f is an automorphism of (ℝ, +). So the problem is to prove that any isomorphism between the groups is of the form e^{f(x)} where f is an additive automorphism, and then discuss when f(x) must be linear.\n\nBut the core problem as per the title is whether e^x is the only isomorphism. The answer is no, unless additional constraints are imposed. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is a group isomorphism from (ℝ, +) to (ℝ>0, *).\n\nProblem:\nIs φ necessarily of the form φ(x) = e^{cx} for some constant c ∈ ℝ?\n\nBut the user's edit mentions that without extra conditions, there are other solutions, but under certain regularity conditions, it's unique. So perhaps the problem is to show that all such isomorphisms are of the form e^{cx} if they are continuous, or measurable, etc. But the original problem title doesn't specify that. Therefore, the problem as posed is ambiguous, but the user's edit clarifies that the answer depends on these conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as intended is to show that e^x is the only continuous isomorphism. In that case, the assumption would be that φ is a continuous group isomorphism. However, the original problem didn't state this. Therefore, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is a group isomorphism from (ℝ, +) to (ℝ>0, *).\nφ is continuous.\n\nProblem:\nProve that φ(x) = e^{cx} for some constant c ∈ ℝ.\n\nBut since the original problem didn't mention continuity, maybe the user is mistaken in their example. Alternatively, perhaps in Vietnamese education, certain problems assume continuity by default. But I need to follow the example given.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had an original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This seems incorrect, unless the problem was misstated. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is faulty, but I have to follow their format regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The groups under consideration are (ℝ, +) and (ℝ>0, *).\n- φ is a group isomorphism between them.\n- φ is continuous. (This is an assumption not stated in the original problem but necessary for the uniqueness.)\n\nBut the original problem's title doesn't mention continuity. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should list the implicit assumptions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are only about the group structures. But in that case, the answer is no, so the problem would be \"Is e^x the only isomorphism between the groups...\" with the assumption that φ is a group isomorphism. Then the answer is no. But the user's edit mentions that under certain conditions, it's yes. Therefore, perhaps the problem should include an assumption about φ being continuous, even if it's not in the original title, because otherwise, the answer is no. But that's adding an assumption not present in the original problem.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Given the example provided by the user, where an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) was added even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", perhaps the task is to extract assumptions from the problem statement, even if they are not explicitly stated. But in that example, adding \"n is divisible by 7\" seems wrong, unless the original problem had a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to list all conditions that are necessary for the problem to hold. In the example, to have A(n) divisible by 91 (which is 7*13), you need n to be divisible by both 7 and 13? Wait, no. Let me check: 5 and 6 are coprime to 7 and 13. Maybe the original problem required n to be such that 5^n and 6^n have certain properties modulo 7 and 13. But if the problem is to show that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, then the assumptions should just be that n is an integer. But the user's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless the original problem had a mistake.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I have to proceed regardless. For the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. φ is a group isomorphism from (ℝ, +) to (ℝ>0, *).\n2. φ is continuous. (This is necessary to ensure uniqueness.)\n\nBut since the original problem's title doesn't mention continuity, but the answers do, perhaps the problem is intended to assume continuity. Therefore, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is a group isomorphism from (ℝ, +) to (ℝ_{>0}, *),\nφ is continuous.\n\nProblem:\nProve that φ(x) = e^{cx} for some constant c ∈ ℝ.\n\nBut I need to check the original question again. The user's original question starts with \"If so, how might I be able to prove it?\" implying that the answer is yes, e^x is the only isomorphism. But in reality, without continuity, it's not. Therefore, the user might have intended to include continuity as an assumption. Therefore, perhaps the correct formatted problem should include that assumption, even though it's not in the title. The user's edit mentions that the answer requires f to be a linear function, which happens under certain regularity conditions. Therefore, to make the problem well-posed, the assumption of continuity or measurability is necessary.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should list the assumptions that φ is a group isomorphism and φ is continuous. Therefore, the answer would be that yes, under continuity, e^{cx} are the only isomorphisms.",
