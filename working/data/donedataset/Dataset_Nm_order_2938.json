    "Content": "Question: Consider a sequence $\\{a_{n}\\}$ such that $a_{1},a_{2}>0$ , and for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we have: $$a_{n+2}=\\sqrt{a_{n+1}}+\\sqrt{a_{n}}$$ Prove that : $\\displaystyle\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}$ exists and find this limit. My work: If this limit exists, let $\\displaystyle\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=x>0$ ;\nthen we have $$x=\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{x}\\Longrightarrow x=4$$ But I can't see how to prove the limit of $\\{a_{n}\\}$ exists.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "and I have consider other solution if $a_{0}>0,a_{1}>0,$ ,and $a_{n+2}=\\sqrt{a_{n+1}}+\\sqrt{a_{n}}$ ,then $a_{n}\\to 4$ pf: if $0<a_{0}\\le a_{1}\\le 1$ ,then $$a_{2}=\\sqrt{a_{1}}+\\sqrt{a_{0}}\\ge a_{1}{}{}$$ we note $$a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}=(\\sqrt{a_{n+1}}+\\sqrt{a_{n}})-(\\sqrt{a_{n}}+\\sqrt{a_{n-1}})=(\\sqrt{a_{n+1}}-\\sqrt{a_{n}})+(\\sqrt{a_{n}}-\\sqrt{a_{n-1}})\\ge 0$$ so $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is  Monotone increasing, $$a_{n}\\le 4,\\mbox{since } a_{n+2}=\\sqrt{a_{n+1}}+\\sqrt{a_{n}}\\le 2+2=4$$ (2):if $0<a_{1}\\le a_{0}\\le 1$ ,then $$a_{2}=\\sqrt{a_{1}}+\\sqrt{a_{0}}\\ge a_{0}$$ and $$a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}=\\sqrt{a_{n+1}}-\\sqrt{a_{n-1}}\\ge 0$$ .the simalar we have $\\{a_{n}\\}$ is increasing and $a_{n}\\le 4$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and identify all the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original title is: \"How to prove this limit exists: $a_{n+2}=\\sqrt{a_{n+1}}+\\sqrt{a_{n}}$\". The question states that the sequence {a_n} has a1, a2 > 0, and for all n in natural numbers, the recurrence relation a_{n+2} = sqrt(a_{n+1}) + sqrt(a_n). The task is to prove that the limit as n approaches infinity of a_n exists and find that limit.\n\nThe user's work mentions assuming the limit x exists, leading to x = 2*sqrt(x), hence x=4. But they need help proving the existence of the limit.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the original problem:\n\n1. The sequence {a_n} is defined such that a1 and a2 are positive. So two initial terms are positive. But in the example, assumptions were split into separate lines. However, here, a1 and a2 are both initial conditions. Should I split them into two separate assumptions? The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So yes, probably each initial term being positive is a separate assumption.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"a1, a2 >0\". Maybe it's considered a single assumption since they are both initial terms. But according to the example, each assumption should be one property for one object. So perhaps split into:\n\n- a₁ is positive\n- a₂ is positive\n\nThen the recurrence relation applies to all natural numbers n. So for all n ∈ ℕ, a_{n+2} = sqrt(a_{n+1}) + sqrt(a_n). That's another assumption. But how to phrase it? The recurrence relation applies to every term in the sequence beyond the second term.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- a₁ > 0\n- a₂ > 0\n- For all n ∈ ℕ, a_{n+2} = √(a_{n+1}) + √(a_n)\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were split into separate lines for each condition. So the recurrence relation is a single assumption applying to all n. Therefore, that's one line.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\na₁ is positive,\na₂ is positive,\nFor each natural number n, a_{n+2} = √(a_{n+1}) + √(a_n)\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} a_n exists and find this limit.\n\nWait, but the original problem includes both proving existence and finding the limit. However, in the example given, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is to prove the limit exists and find it.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be written as is, just structured. So the problem statement here is exactly that: Prove that the limit exists and find it.\n\nNow, check if there are any other assumptions. The user didn't mention any constraints other than a1, a2 >0 and the recurrence. So the assumptions are the three points above.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had an expression A(n) and the formatted problem included the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be an error. Wait, perhaps the original problem was actually for n divisible by 7, but the user example might have a mistake. Hmm, but maybe I need to stick to the instruction.\n\nIn any case, in this current problem, the original assumptions are a1 and a2 positive, and the recurrence for all n. So I need to list those as separate assumptions. So the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na₁ > 0,\na₂ > 0,\nFor each natural number n, a_{n+2} = √(a_{n+1}) + √(a_n)\nProblem:\nProve that lim_{n→∞} a_n exists and find this limit.\n\nThat seems to capture all the necessary assumptions and the problem. The initial terms are positive, the recurrence holds for all n, and the problem is to prove existence and find the limit.",
