    "AcceptedAnswer": "By the substitution $x = e^{-t}$, we find that $$\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{(\\log (1/x))^s}{1+x^2} \\; dx\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^s e^{-t}}{1 + e^{-2t}} \\; dt \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n t^s e^{-(2n+1)t} \\; dt \\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n \\, \\frac{\\Gamma(s+1)}{(2n+1)^{s+1}} \\\\\n&= \\Gamma(s+1)L(s+1, \\chi_4),\n\\end{align*}$$ where $L(s, \\chi_4)$ is the Dirichlet L-function of the unique non-principal character $\\chi_4$ to the modulus 4. Often it is denoted as $\\beta(s)$ and called the Dirichlet beta function . Thus differentiating both sides with respect to $s$ and plugging $s = 0$, we obtain a representation formula $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log \\log (1/x)}{1+x^2} \\; dx = \\psi_0(1) \\beta(1) + \\beta'(1),$$ and the problem reduces to find the value of $\\beta(1)$ and $\\beta'(1)$. Note that $\\beta(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is just the Gregory series . For $\\beta'(1)$, we first notice that the following functional equation holds. $$ \\beta(s)=\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{s-1} \\Gamma(1-s) \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi s}{2} \\right)\\,\\beta(1-s). $$ This follows from the general theory of Dirichlet L-functions, and one can consult with any analytic number theory textbook to find its proof. Therefore it is sufficient to calculate $\\beta'(0)$. For $0 < s$, we have $$\\begin{align*}\n-\\beta'(s)\n&= \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{\\log(4n+1)}{(4n+1)^s} - \\frac{\\log(4n-1)}{(4n-1)^s} \\right] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(4n)^s} \\left[ \\log \\left( \\frac{4n+1}{4n-1} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2n} \\right] + 2^{-2s-1}\\zeta(s+1) \\\\\n& \\qquad + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{(4n+1)^s} - \\frac{1}{(4n)^s} \\right) \\log (4n+1) \\\\\n& \\qquad + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{(4n)^s} - \\frac{1}{(4n-1)^s} \\right) \\log (4n-1) \\\\\n& =: A(s) +  2^{-2s-1}\\zeta(s+1) + B(s) + C(s).\n\\end{align*}$$ We first estimate $B(s)$. As $n \\to \\infty$, we have $$ \\log \\left( \\frac{4n}{4n+1} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{4n} + O\\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} \\right), \\quad \\log \\left( \\frac{4n}{4n-1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4n} + O\\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} \\right). $$ Thus when $s \\to 0$, $$\\begin{align*}\nB(s)\n&= \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(4n)^s} \\left[ \\exp\\left( s \\log \\left( \\frac{4n}{4n+1} \\right) \\right) - 1 \\right] \\left[ \\log (4n) - \\log \\left(\\frac{4n}{4n+1} \\right) \\right] \\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(4n)^s} \\left[ - \\frac{s}{4n} + O \\left(\\frac{s^2}{n^2} \\right) \\right] \\left[ \\log (4n) + O \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\right) \\right] \\\\\n&= -s 2^{-2s-2} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{s+1}} \\log (4n) + O(s) \\\\\n&= s 2^{-2s-2} \\left[ \\zeta'(s+1) - \\zeta(s+1) \\log 4 \\right] + O(s).\n\\end{align*}$$ Similar consideration also shows that $$ C(s) = s 2^{-2s-2} \\left[ \\zeta'(s+1) - \\zeta(s+1) \\log 4 \\right] + O(s).$$ Thus we have $$ 2^{-2s-1}\\zeta(s+1) + B(s) + C(s) = 2^{-2s-1} \\left[ \\zeta(s+1) + s \\zeta'(s+1) - s \\zeta(s+1) \\log 4 \\right] + O(s). $$ But since $$\\zeta(1+s) = \\frac{1}{s} + \\gamma + O(s),$$ we have $$ \\lim_{s\\downarrow 0} \\left( 2^{-2s-1}\\zeta(s+1) + B(s) + C(s) \\right) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} - \\log 2.$$ For $A(s)$, the summands are positive with possible finite exceptional terms. Thus the Monotone Convergence Theorem guarantees that $$ \\lim_{s\\downarrow 0} A(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\log \\left( \\frac{4n+1}{4n-1} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2n} \\right]. $$ Let $L$ denote this limit. Then by Stirling's formula , $$\\begin{align*}\ne^{L}\n& \\stackrel{N\\to\\infty}{\\sim} \\prod_{n=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{4n+1}{4n-1} \\right) e^{-1/2n}\n \\sim \\frac{e^{-\\gamma/2}}{\\sqrt{N}} \\prod_{n=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{n+(1/4)}{n-(1/4)} \\right) \\\\\n& \\sim \\frac{e^{-\\gamma/2}}{\\sqrt{N}} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(N+\\frac{5}{4}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(N+\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}\n \\sim \\frac{e^{-\\gamma/2}}{\\sqrt{N}} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)} \\frac{\\left( \\frac{N + (5/4)}{e} \\right)^{N+\\frac{5}{4}}}{\\left( \\frac{N + (3/4)}{e} \\right)^{N+\\frac{3}{4}}} \\\\\n& \\sim e^{-\\gamma/2} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)}\n= 4 e^{-\\gamma/2} \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2},\n\\end{align*}$$ where we have used the Euler's reflection formula in the last line. Combining all the efforts, we obtain $$-\\beta'(0) = \\log (2 \\pi \\sqrt{2}) - 2 \\log \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) .$$ Now taking logarithmic differntiation to the functional equation, we have $$ \\frac{\\beta'(s)}{\\beta(s)} = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\psi_0 (1-s) - \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\tan \\left( \\frac{\\pi s}{2} \\right) - \\frac{\\beta'(1-s)}{\\beta(1-s)}. $$ Taking $s = 0$, we have $$ \\frac{\\beta'(0)}{\\beta(0)} = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\gamma - \\frac{\\beta'(1)}{\\beta(1)} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\beta'(1) = \\beta(1) \\left[ \\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\gamma - \\frac{\\beta'(0)}{\\beta(0)} \\right]. $$ But again by the functional equation, we have $\\beta(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore $$ \\beta'(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left[ \\gamma + 2 \\log 2 + 3 \\log \\pi  - 4 \\log \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\right], $$ and hence $$ \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log \\log (1/x)}{1+x^2} \\; dx = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left[ 2 \\log 2 + 3 \\log \\pi  - 4 \\log \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\right], $$ which is identical to the proposed answer.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to understand the original problem and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original question is about evaluating an integral: the integral from 0 to 1 of log(log(1/x)) divided by (1 + x²) dx. The user wants this problem structured with assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object per line.\n\nLooking at the integral, the limits are from 0 to 1, the integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²), and the expected result involves a logarithmic expression with Gamma functions. The problem mentions that it was part of another question about solving integrals involving powers of log(sin(πx)), but the user here is focusing on the specific integral given.\n\nNow, to structure this into the required format. The assumptions should be about the variables and conditions in the problem. The integral is definite from 0 to 1, so the variable x is in that interval. The integrand involves log(log(1/x)), which requires that log(1/x) is positive and that log(1/x) is defined, meaning x must be between 0 and 1 (since 1/x > 1, so log(1/x) > 0). Additionally, the denominator 1 + x² is never zero in this interval, so no division by zero issues. However, at x=0, log(1/x) tends to infinity, so the integrand has a singularity there. But since the integral is from 0 to 1, we need to check if it's convergent. However, the problem statement assumes the integral exists and asks to evaluate it, so maybe the user doesn't need to list convergence as an assumption unless specified. The example given in the user's example didn't include convergence assumptions, just the variable conditions. So perhaps the main assumption here is that x is in [0,1], and the integrand is defined there except at x=0, but since it's an integral, maybe the assumption is that the integral converges. However, the example the user provided only listed the variable's conditions. Let me check the example again: in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumptions are about the variable x being in the interval (0,1), but since the integral is from 0 to 1, maybe the function is integrable over that interval. But the user's example didn't mention convergence; it just listed the variable's properties. So maybe here, the key assumptions are the limits of integration and the form of the integrand. But the problem as stated doesn't have additional conditions except x in [0,1]. Wait, but the integrand log(log(1/x)) requires that log(1/x) > 0, so 1/x > 1, which is true for x in (0,1). At x=1, log(1/x) = 0, so log(0) is undefined. But the integral is up to x=1. Wait, actually, when x approaches 1 from the left, log(1/x) approaches log(1) = 0, so log(log(1/x)) approaches log(0), which tends to negative infinity. Therefore, the integrand has a singularity at x=1 as well. However, the original problem statement includes x=1 in the integral. But perhaps the integral is interpreted as an improper integral at both endpoints. However, the problem doesn't specify this; it just presents the integral. Therefore, the assumptions here might be that the integral is taken over the interval [0,1], and the integrand is defined as log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²), considering possible improper integrals at 0 and 1. However, in the example provided by the user, they didn't list assumptions about convergence, just the variable's properties. So perhaps for this problem, the assumptions are simply that x is in [0,1], and the integrand is as given. But since log(log(1/x)) is undefined at x=1 (since log(1/x)=0 there), and at x=0, log(1/x) is infinity, so log(infinity) is infinity. Thus, the integral has singularities at both endpoints, but the problem assumes it converges. However, the user's example didn't include such assumptions, so maybe we don't need to list them unless the problem explicitly states them. The problem here just presents the integral and asks to show it equals that expression. Therefore, the key assumption is that the integral is over x from 0 to 1, and the integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²). But perhaps the user wants me to list the domain of x. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable in the interval (0,1),\nthe integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²).\n\nBut wait, the original problem writes the integrand as log(log(1/x)) * dx/(1 + x²). So the integrand is log(log(1/x)) divided by (1 + x²). The variable x is integrated from 0 to 1. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is log(log(1/x)) / (1 + x²).\n\nBut in the example given by the user, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, maybe the key is that the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is as specified. However, since the problem is to evaluate the integral, perhaps there are no additional constraints needed. But maybe the function is integrable over [0,1], but that's part of the problem's premise. The user example didn't include convergence; it just listed properties of n. So here, the main assumption is that the integral is over x from 0 to 1. But perhaps we need to break down into more specific assumptions. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0,1],\nThe integrand is log(log(1/x)) divided by (1 + x²),\nThe variable x is real.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions for n. Here, maybe:\n\n- x is a real variable in the interval (0,1),\n- The integrand is defined as log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²),\n- The integral is an improper integral at both endpoints 0 and 1.\n\nBut the original problem statement writes the integral from 0 to 1 without specifying improper, but mathematically, it's required. However, the user's example didn't include such details. Given that, perhaps the assumptions are minimal, like:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from x = 0 to x = 1,\nThe integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the variable x is integrated over [0,1], so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable in the interval [0,1],\nThe integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²).\n\nBut since at x=0 and x=1, the integrand is problematic, perhaps the integral is considered as an improper integral. But the user's example didn't include such an assumption. Therefore, maybe it's better to list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is an improper integral over [0,1],\nThe integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²).\n\nBut the problem statement as given in the example didn't mention the integral being improper. Therefore, perhaps the problem is presented as is, and the assumptions are implicit. Given that the example included only the variable's properties, perhaps here the main assumption is the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is as given. Therefore, structuring the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x^2).\n\nProblem: Show that  \n$$\\int_0^1 \\log \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\log \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}{ \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)} \\right).$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title was \"Evaluating ∫₀¹ log(log(1/x)) dx/(1+x²)\" and the question body includes the same integral equated to the expression with Gamma functions. The user also mentions it's part of another question but that's extraneous. So the problem is to show that the integral equals that expression. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the integral as the problem, and the assumptions as per the integral's properties. Since the example didn't mention the variable's domain unless necessary, perhaps the main assumption is that the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is as given. But in the example, they listed the variable's condition (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So here, the variable x is integrated over [0,1], so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number in the interval [0,1],\nThe integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²).\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property. So split into two:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is in the interval [0,1],\nThe integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²).\n\nAlternatively, since the integral is from 0 to 1, maybe the first assumption is that the integral is taken over x from 0 to 1. Then the second is the integrand's form. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over x from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is log(log(1/x))/(1 + x²).\n\nBut the example had two assumptions about the same variable n. Here, the first assumption is the interval, the second is the integrand. This seems okay. Therefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0,1],\nThe integrand is $\\log \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) \\div (1 + x^2)$.\nProblem:\nShow that  \n$$\\int_0^1 \\log \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\log \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}{ \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)} \\right).$$\n###\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the right-hand side is written as (sqrt(2π) Γ(3/4)) / Γ(1/4) inside the log, so the fraction is inside the log. The user's example uses LaTeX formatting, so I need to make sure the LaTeX is correctly transcribed. Also, the division should be represented with \\frac or /. The original problem uses a slash, so in LaTeX, it's written as \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}.\n\nSo the problem statement should have that fraction inside the log. Also, the assumptions: the first line is about the integral's limits, the second about the integrand. Each as separate lines. The variable x is part of the integral's definition, so perhaps the first assumption is redundant because the integral's limits already imply x is in [0,1]. But following the example where n's properties are listed, perhaps here we need to state that x is integrated from 0 to 1, and the integrand is as given. Therefore, the assumptions are correctly structured as two separate points.",
