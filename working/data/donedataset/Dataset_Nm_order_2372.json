    "Content": "I need to prove the cube root is irrational. I followed the proof for the square root of $2$ but I ran into a problem I wasn't sure of. Here are my steps: By contradiction, say $ \\sqrt[3]{2}$ is rational then $ \\sqrt[3]{2} = \\frac ab$ in the lowest form, where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, b \\neq 0$ $2b^3 = a^3 $ $b^3 = \\frac{a^3}{2}$ therefore, $a^3$ is even therefore, $2\\mid a^3$, therefore, $2\\mid a$ $\\exists k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, a = 2k$ sub in: $2b^3 = (2k)^3$ $b^3 = 4k^3$, therefore $2|b$ Contradiction, $a$ and $b$ have common factor of two My problem is with step 6 and 7. Can I say that if $2\\mid a^3$ , then $2\\mid a$. If so, I'm gonna have to prove it. How??",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic tells us that every positive integer $a$ has a unique factorization into primes $p_1^{\\alpha_1}p_2^{\\alpha_2} \\ldots p_n^{\\alpha_n}$. You have $ 2 \\mid a^3$, so $2 \\mid (p_1^{\\alpha_1}p_2^{\\alpha_2} \\ldots p_n^{\\alpha_n})^3 = p_1^{3\\alpha_1}p_2^{3\\alpha_2} \\ldots p_n^{3\\alpha_n}$. Since primes are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves, and 2 divides one of them, one of those primes (say, $p_1$) must be $2$. So we have $2 \\mid a^3 = 2^{3\\alpha_1}p_2^{3\\alpha_2} \\ldots p_n^{3\\alpha_n}$, and if you take the cube root of $a^3$ to get $a$, it's $2^{\\alpha_1}p_2^{\\alpha_2} \\ldots p_n^{\\alpha_n}$. This has a factor of 2 in it, and therefore it's divisible by 2.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem statement is then restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question about proving the cube root of 2 is irrational. The original problem is in the title and the user details their steps. They followed the square root of 2 proof but got stuck at steps 6 and 7, specifically whether if 2 divides a³, then 2 divides a, and how to prove that.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem starts by assuming the cube root of 2 is rational, so the first assumption is that ∛2 can be expressed as a fraction a/b in lowest terms. Then, from the equation 2b³ = a³, they derive that a³ is even. The user is questioning whether 2 dividing a³ implies 2 divides a. So, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The cube root of 2 is rational, so there exist integers a and b with b ≠ 0 such that ∛2 = a/b in lowest terms.\n2. From this, 2b³ = a³.\n3. Therefore, a³ is even, implying 2 divides a³.\n4. Then, needing to show that if 2 divides a³, then 2 divides a. (This is the step the user is unsure about.)\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\n- ∛2 is rational, so there exists integers a, b with b ≠ 0 such that ∛2 = a/b.\n- The fraction a/b is in its lowest terms (i.e., a and b are coprime).\n- From ∛2 = a/b, we get 2 = (a³)/(b³) => 2b³ = a³.\n- Therefore, a³ is even (2 divides a³).\n- If 2 divides a³, then 2 divides a. (This is the critical step to confirm as an assumption or part of the problem.)\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions included conditions on n, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem's core is to prove the cube root of 2 is irrational. The user's steps involve assuming the opposite, leading to 2 divides a³, and then needing to prove 2 divides a. The question is whether this step is valid and how to prove it. So, in structuring the problem, maybe the assumption is that a and b are coprime integers, and the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction. However, the user is specifically stuck on step 6 and 7, which is about the implication that 2 divides a³ implies 2 divides a.\n\nSo, perhaps the structured problem should focus on that implication. But according to the example, the original problem was restated with the necessary assumptions. In the example, the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7 was included, even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. Maybe the example had an error? Wait, let me check again. The example original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. If the problem is for every integer n, why is the assumption that n is divisible by 7? Maybe the example is incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to restructure a problem where they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But maybe that's a mistake. Regardless, following the user's example, they list assumptions line by line, each about one property or condition of one object.\n\nSo, for the cube root problem, the main assumptions in the proof by contradiction are:\n\n1. ∛2 is rational.\n2. Therefore, ∛2 = a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors (since it's in lowest terms).\n3. This leads to 2b³ = a³.\n4. From 2b³ = a³, it follows that a³ is even.\n5. Then, if 2 divides a³, 2 must divide a (which needs justification).\n\nBut the problem the user is presenting is to prove that ∛2 is irrational, following the steps similar to sqrt(2) proof, and they got stuck on the step where 2 divides a³ implying 2 divides a. So the formatted problem should capture the core problem they need to solve, which is proving the irrationality, but in the context of their steps, the key assumption is that ∛2 is rational, leading to the equation, and the problem includes the need to prove that if 2 divides a³, then 2 divides a.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem would list the assumptions and then the problem. So the assumptions would be the initial conditions of the problem. In the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and n divisible by 7.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was about restructuring the problem with specific assumptions. But in the cube root problem, the assumptions are that ∛2 is rational, so there exist integers a and b with certain properties, and the problem is to show a contradiction. But the user's specific problem is about the step where 2|a³ implies 2|a. So maybe the formatted problem should be to prove that if 2 divides a³, then 2 divides a, but the overall problem is still proving the cube root of 2 is irrational. Hmm.\n\nBut the user's original question is \"Prove the cuberoot of 2 is irrational\", and their steps lead them to a point where they need to justify that 2|a³ implies 2|a. So the formatted problem should be the main problem, which is proving the cube root is irrational, with the assumptions including that a and b are coprime, and 2 divides a³. However, in the example, the problem's assumptions included properties on n, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the assumptions in the cube root problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \n∛2 is rational,\nThere exist integers a, b such that ∛2 = a/b and a/b is in lowest terms,\nFrom ∛2 = a/b, it follows that 2b³ = a³,\nTherefore, a³ is even.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∛2 is irrational by showing that the assumption leads to a contradiction, particularly by proving that if 2 divides a³, then 2 divides a.\n\nBut the example's problem part was the original problem statement. Maybe in this case, the problem is \"Prove that ∛2 is irrational\", with the assumptions being the steps taken in the proof by contradiction. Wait, but the example extracted assumptions from the problem. For instance, the original problem was about divisibility by 91 for all integers n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then n being divisible by 7 isn't an assumption but a specific case. Maybe that example is incorrect. Anyway, following the instructions, the task is to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nSo, in the cube root problem, the assumptions for the proof by contradiction would be:\n\n1. ∛2 is rational.\n2. There exist integers a and b such that ∛2 = a/b.\n3. The fraction a/b is in lowest terms (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1).\n4. From the equation ∛2 = a/b, it follows that 2b³ = a³.\n5. Therefore, 2 divides a³.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∛2 is irrational by contradiction, showing that 2 divides a³ implies 2 divides a, leading to a contradiction with the assumption that a/b is in lowest terms.\n\nBut the user's specific problem is about proving the cube root is irrational, and their step 6-7 is about 2|a³ ⇒ 2|a. So perhaps the structured problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n∛2 is rational,\nThere exist integers a and b with b ≠ 0 such that ∛2 = a/b,\nThe fraction a/b is in lowest terms (gcd(a, b) = 1),\nFrom the equation, 2b³ = a³,\n2 divides a³.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∛2 is irrational by showing that 2 divides a³ implies 2 divides a, leading to a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is just the original problem statement. However, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem included an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to highlight specific conditions needed for the problem. In this case, the cube root problem's key step is showing that 2|a³ ⇒ 2|a. Therefore, maybe the problem should be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\na is an integer,\n2 divides a³.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2 divides a.\n\nBut the main problem is proving the cube root of 2 is irrational. The user's question is about structuring the problem as per the example. The example included the main problem statement and assumptions, even if some assumptions were part of the proof method (like contradiction).\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions are the starting points for the proof by contradiction. So:\n\nAssumption:\n∛2 is rational,\nThere exist integers a and b such that ∛2 = a/b,\na and b are coprime (no common factors),\n2b³ = a³.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∛2 is irrational by showing that under these assumptions, 2 divides both a and b, leading to a contradiction.\n\nBut the user's specific issue is about the step 2|a³ implying 2|a. So perhaps the problem is to prove that if 2 divides a³, then 2 divides a, which is a lemma needed in the proof. Therefore, the formatted problem could be:\n\nAssumption:\na is an integer,\n2 divides a³.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2 divides a.\n\nBut the user's main goal is to prove the cube root of 2 is irrational, so maybe the problem statement remains that, with assumptions leading to needing to prove that lemma. However, the example given by the user includes the main problem statement, even with added assumptions. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's example where they restated the original problem but added an assumption (n divisible by 7), which might not be in the original problem, perhaps in this case, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n∛2 is rational,\nThere exist integers a and b with b ≠ 0 such that ∛2 = a/b,\nThe fraction a/b is in lowest terms,\n2 divides a³.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∛2 is irrational by demonstrating that 2 divides a, leading to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, more accurately, since the original problem is \"Prove the cuberoot of 2 is irrational\", the formatted problem should be that, with the assumptions being the starting points of the proof by contradiction. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n∛2 is rational,\nThere exist integers a and b with b ≠ 0 such that ∛2 = a/b,\nThe fraction a/b is in lowest terms (gcd(a, b) = 1),\nFrom the equation 2b³ = a³, it follows that a³ is even.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∛2 is irrational by contradiction, showing that 2 divides a³ implies 2 divides a, which contradicts the assumption that a and b are coprime.\n\nBut the user's specific issue is about justifying that step, so maybe the problem is to prove that 2 divides a³ implies 2 divides a. However, the main problem is still about the cube root. It's a bit conflicting. Given the example, which restates the original problem with added assumptions, perhaps here the formatted problem would include the main problem and the key assumptions from the proof by contradiction method. Therefore, the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is rational,\nThere exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\\sqrt[3]{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$,\n$\\frac{a}{b}$ is in lowest terms (i.e., $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$),\n$2b^3 = a^3$,\n$a^3$ is even.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational by showing that $2 \\mid a^3$ implies $2 \\mid a$, leading to a contradiction.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nBut wait, the example had each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: \n$\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is rational,\nThere exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\\sqrt[3]{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$,\n$\\gcd(a, b) = 1$,\n$2b^3 = a^3$,\n$2$ divides $a^3$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational by contradiction.\n\nBut the user's problem is specifically about the step where 2 divides a³ implies 2 divides a. However, the overall problem is to prove the cube root's irrationality. Given the example, perhaps the formatted problem includes the main problem and lists the assumptions made in the proof by contradiction. Therefore, the correct format would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is rational,\nThere exist integers $a$ and $b$ with $b \\neq 0$,\n$\\gcd(a, b) = 1$,\n$2b^3 = a^3$,\n$2$ divides $a^3$.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational by showing that $2 \\mid a$ leads to a contradiction with $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nAlternatively, more aligned with the example where the problem is restated and assumptions are specific:\n\nThe example's formatted problem was:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nSo, similarly, for the cube root problem:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ and $b$ are integers,\n$\\gcd(a, b) = 1$,\n$2b^3 = a^3$,\n$2$ divides $a^3$.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational by contradiction.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumption to list here is the rationality leading to the equation, and then the divisibility. However, the example included both n being integer and n divisible by 7 as assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user wants to extract specific conditions from the problem. Given that, here's my best attempt:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is rational,\nThere exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\\sqrt[3]{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$ in lowest terms,\n$2b^3 = a^3$,\n$a^3$ is even.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational by showing that $2 \\mid a^3$ implies $2 \\mid a$, leading to a contradiction.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",
