    "Content": "I was trying to prove the following statement(#9(a) in Guillemin & Pollack 1.2) but I couldn't make much progress. \"Show that for any manifolds $X$ and $Y$, $$T_{(x,y)}(X\\times Y)=T_x(X)\\times T_y(Y).$$\" My attempt so far: Parametrise X and Y locally with $U\\overset{\\phi}{\\longrightarrow}X$ and $V\\overset{\\psi}{\\longrightarrow}Y$ where $U\\subset \\mathbf R^m$ and $V\\subset \\mathbf R^n$. Now we can parametrise $U\\times V\\overset{\\phi\\times \\psi}{\\longrightarrow}X\\times Y$. By taking the derivative map, we have the tangent plane. $\\mathbf R^{m+n}\\overset{d(\\phi\\times \\psi)}\\longrightarrow T_{(x,y)}(X\\times Y)$. I don't know what to do after this... Apparently we are supposed to set up some relation between $T_{(x,y)}(X\\times Y)$ and $T_x(X)\\times T_y(Y)$... Anyone would like to help me out? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't understand what you are trying to do and here's what I would do. Consider the canonical projections $\\pi_X,\\pi_Y$ from $X \\times Y$ to $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Let $(p,q) \\in X \\times Y$ and now consider the map $$f : T_{(p,q)}(X \\times Y) \\to T_p X \\times T_q Y$$ that sends a vector $v$ to elements $\\Big(d(\\pi_X)_{(p,q)}(v), d(\\pi_Y)_{(p,q)}(v) \\Big)$ . This is linear since $d(\\pi_X)_{(p,q)}$ and $d(\\pi_Y)_{(p,q)}$ are both linear. On the other hand, define $$g : T_p X \\times T_q Y \\to T_{(p,q)} (X \\times Y)$$ that sends a pair of vectors $(v,w)$ to $d(\\iota_X)_p(v) +d(\\iota_Y)_q(w)$ , where $\\iota_X : X \\to X\\times Y$ sends $X$ to the slice $X \\times \\{q\\}$ and similarly for $\\iota_Y$ . Using that \\begin{align}\n\\pi_X \\circ \\iota_X =\\operatorname{id}_X, \\ \\ \\pi_Y\\circ \\iota_Y=\\operatorname{id}_Y,\n\\end{align} $\\pi_Y \\circ \\iota_X, \\ \\ \\pi_X\\circ \\iota_Y$ are constant maps and chain rule, we have \\begin{align}(f \\circ g) (v, w) &= f ( d(\\iota_X)_p(v) +d(\\iota_Y)_q(w)) \\\\ \n&= \\Big(d(\\pi_X)_{(p,q)}( d(\\iota_X)_p(v) +d(\\iota_Y)_q(w)), d(\\pi_Y)_{(p,q)}( d(\\iota_X)_p(v) +d(\\iota_Y)_q(w)) \\Big) \\\\\n&=\\Big(d(\\pi_X\\circ \\iota_X)_p(v) +d(\\pi_X\\circ\\iota_Y)_q(w)), d(\\pi_Y\\circ\\iota_X)_p(v) +d(\\pi_Y\\circ\\iota_Y)_q(w)) \\Big) \\\\\n&= (v, w)\n\\end{align} Thus $f$ is surjective. Since $T_{(p,q)}(X \\times Y)$ and $ T_p X \\times T_q Y$ have the same dimension, $f$ is a linear isomorphism.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem about the tangent space of a product manifold. The user wants to show that T_{(x,y)}(X×Y) is equal to T_x(X) × T_y(Y). Alright, first, I need to recall some basic definitions about tangent spaces and product manifolds.\n\nSo, tangent spaces can be defined in a few ways, like using derivations or equivalence classes of curves. Guillemin & Pollack probably use the derivative of parameterizations approach since the user mentioned parametrizing X and Y. Let me check their approach.\n\nThe user tried parametrizing X and Y with φ: U → X and ψ: V → Y, where U and V are open subsets in R^m and R^n. Then they consider the product parametrization φ×ψ: U×V → X×Y. Taking the derivative of this product map gives a map from R^{m+n} to T_{(x,y)}(X×Y). \n\nHmm, the tangent space of a manifold at a point is the image of the derivative of a parametrization around that point. So, for X×Y, the parametrization is the product of the parametrizations of X and Y. The derivative of a product map would be the direct sum of the derivatives, right? So d(φ×ψ)_{(u,v)} = dφ_u × dψ_v. That would map R^m × R^n to T_x X × T_y Y. Wait, but T_{(x,y)}(X×Y) is supposed to be the image of d(φ×ψ), which is R^{m+n} mapped via the product derivative. Since d(φ×ψ) is essentially dφ ⊕ dψ, then the image is the direct sum of T_x X and T_y Y, which should be isomorphic to T_x X × T_y Y. \n\nBut maybe I need to make this more precise. Let's think about the tangent vectors. A tangent vector at (x,y) in X×Y can be represented by the derivative of a curve γ(t) = (α(t), β(t)) where α is a curve in X through x and β is a curve in Y through y. Then the derivative γ’(0) would be (α’(0), β’(0)), which is an element of T_x X × T_y Y. Conversely, any element of T_x X × T_y Y can be seen as a pair of tangent vectors, which correspond to curves in X and Y, and their product gives a curve in X×Y, hence a tangent vector in T_{(x,y)}(X×Y). \n\nTherefore, there's a natural isomorphism between the two spaces. The user might need to formalize this argument using the parametrizations. Since the derivative of the product parametrization splits into the derivatives of each component, the tangent space of the product manifold is the product of the tangent spaces. \n\nAnother approach is using the universal property of the product. The projections π_X: X×Y → X and π_Y: X×Y → Y induce maps on the tangent spaces dπ_X: T_{(x,y)}(X×Y) → T_x X and dπ_Y: T_{(x,y)}(X×Y) → T_y Y. Then the product of these maps gives a linear transformation from T_{(x,y)}(X×Y) to T_x X × T_y Y. One can show this is an isomorphism by constructing an inverse using the inclusions of X and Y into X×Y. \n\nThe user's attempt uses parametrizations, so maybe they should consider how the tangent vectors in the product are related to the individual tangent spaces. Since R^{m+n} is the product of R^m and R^n, and the derivative d(φ×ψ) would map (u,v) to (dφ(u), dψ(v)), then the image is the product of the images of dφ and dψ, which are T_x X and T_y Y. Hence, T_{(x,y)}(X×Y) is isomorphic to T_x X × T_y Y. \n\nI think the key point is to note that the tangent space of the product manifold decomposes naturally into the product of the tangent spaces because the derivative of the product map splits into the derivatives of each component. The user needs to make this precise, possibly by showing that the map from T_{(x,y)}(X×Y) to T_x X × T_y Y is linear, injective, and surjective. \n\nAlternatively, using curves: any tangent vector in the product can be written as a combination of tangent vectors from each factor, and vice versa. So the dimensions should add up, confirming the isomorphism. \n\nThe problem doesn't specify any additional conditions on X and Y, just that they are manifolds. So the assumptions are just that X and Y are manifolds, and we're looking at the tangent space at a point (x,y) in their product. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those basic assumptions.",
