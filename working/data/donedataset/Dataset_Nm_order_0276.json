    "Content": "Suppose $f$ and $g$ are Lebesgue measurable, we want to show $f+g$ is measurable. So, the hint is to consider the continuous functions $F : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R} $ given by $h(x) = F(f ,g ) $. If we can show $F$ Is measurable, then Taking $F = f +g $ would solve our problem. In other words, I want to show that the set $R = \\{ (f,g) : F(f,g) > a $ } is lebesgue measurable.. But this set is just a rectangle in the plane. And since $F$ is continuous, then $R$ must be open, and hence a union of open rectangles which are measurable and hence $R$ must be measurable. Is this a correct approach to the problem? Can someone help me to make this formal? thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a method I used in my analysis class. Note that $f(x) + g(x) < t$ iff $f(x) < t-g(x)$ iff there exists a rational  number $r$ such that $f(x) < r < t-g(x)$. Therefore $\\{x : f(x) + g(x) < t\\} = \\bigcup_{r\\in\\Bbb Q} [f^{-1}((-\\infty, r)) \\cap g^{-1}((-\\infty, t-r))]$. Both the sets being intersected in the union are measurable sets. Hence the set on the left is also measurable, meaning that $f+g$ is measurable.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the sum of two measurable functions f and g is measurable. They mentioned using a continuous function F from R² to R, specifically F(f, g) = f + g. The idea is that since F is continuous, the preimage of an open set (like (a, ∞)) should be measurable, and since f and g are measurable, the pair (f, g) is measurable into R². Then composing with F would preserve measurability.\n\nWait, but the user's approach talks about the set R = { (f, g) : F(f, g) > a } being measurable. Hmm, actually, in measure theory, when dealing with functions into product spaces, the measurability of the pair (f, g) is equivalent to each component being measurable. So if f and g are measurable, then the map x ↦ (f(x), g(x)) is measurable from R to R². Then, since F is continuous (hence Borel measurable), the composition F(f(x), g(x)) = f(x) + g(x) should be measurable. That's the standard argument. \n\nBut the user's reasoning mentions that R is a rectangle in the plane and since F is continuous, R is open, hence a union of open rectangles which are measurable. But I think there's a confusion here. The set they should be considering is the preimage of (a, ∞) under F, which in the plane is an open set because F is continuous. But how does that relate to the measurability of f + g? The key step is that the composition of a Borel measurable function (like F, which is continuous) with a measurable function (the pair (f, g)) is measurable. Therefore, f + g is measurable.\n\nSo the user's approach is correct in essence, but perhaps not phrased precisely. They need to formalize that (f, g) is a measurable function from R to R², and F is Borel measurable, so their composition is measurable. The set {x | f(x) + g(x) > a} is the preimage under the measurable function F(f, g) of (a, ∞), hence measurable.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be that f and g are Lebesgue measurable functions, and the problem is to show that f + g is Lebesgue measurable.",
