    "Content": "Let $(X,\\mathscr T)$ be a topological space. Given $A\\subseteq X$, we say that $x$ is a complete limit point of $A$ if for every nbhd $N$ of $x$, $|N\\cap A|=|A|$. I want to prove Suppose $(X,\\mathscr T)$ is compact. Then every infinite subset $A$ of $X$ has a complete limit point in $X$. PROOF Assume the contrary. Then there exists an infinite subset $A$ of $X$ such that for any $x\\in X$, there is a nbhd $N_x$ such that $|N_x\\cap A|<|A|$. The collection $\\{N_x:x\\in X\\}$ covers $X$. By compactness, there exists a finite subcover $\\{N_{x_1},\\ldots, N_{x_n}\\}$. Then $A=\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A\\cap N_{x_i}$. But this is impossible, since $A$ is infinite, and $\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A\\cap N_{x_i}$ is a finite union of sets strictly smaller than $A$. Is this correct? The problem is in \" Introductory Real Analysis \" by Kolmogorov. Also, is a proof of the converse too complicated? Kolmogorov gives a reference as \"P.S. Alexandroff, Einführung in die Mengenlehre und die Theorie der Reellen Funktionen (1956), pp. 250-251; J.L. Kelley, General Topology (1955), pp. 163-164\" but I have no idea what this means. I am honestly clueless on how to approach it. Could you provide hints? I wouldn't mind a complete answer, if you think it is requires something too advanced.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof is correct.  For the converse, suppose $X$ is not compact.  Let $\\mathcal{O}$ be an open cover of $X$ of minimal cardinality [such that no finite subcover exists], and let $\\{O_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha < |\\mathcal{O}|}$ be an enumeration of $\\mathcal{O}$.  Construct a set $A$ as follows: let $x_\\alpha \\in X$ be any element not covered by any of the $O_\\beta$ for $\\beta < \\alpha$.  Such $x_\\alpha$ exists or else $\\{O_\\beta\\}_{\\beta < \\alpha}$ would be an open cover, contradicting the minimality of $|\\mathcal{O}|$. let $A = \\{x_\\alpha : \\alpha < |\\mathcal{O}|\\}$ We'll show that $A$ has no complete limit point.  Indeed, for any $x \\in X$ there is some $\\alpha$ such that $O_\\alpha$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, but $O_\\alpha$ avoids all the $x_\\beta$ for $\\beta > \\alpha$, and so: $$\\left |A \\cap O_\\alpha\\right | \\leq \\left|\\{x_\\gamma : \\gamma \\leq \\alpha\\}\\right| = |\\alpha| < |\\mathcal{O}| = |A|$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about proving that a compact topological space has the property that every infinite subset has a complete limit point. They also provided a proof attempt and are wondering if it's correct, as well as how to approach the converse. \n\nFirst, let me parse the original problem. The definition given for a complete limit point is crucial here: a point x is a complete limit point of A if every neighborhood of x intersects A in a set of the same cardinality as A. So, for example, if A is countably infinite, every neighborhood of x must contain infinitely many points of A. But the key here is that the intersection has the same cardinality as A itself, which is stronger than just being a limit point (where the intersection just needs to be non-empty).\n\nThe user's proof attempt assumes the contrary: suppose there's an infinite subset A with no complete limit point. Then for each x in X, there's a neighborhood N_x such that |N_x ∩ A| < |A|. Since the space is compact, we can cover X with finitely many such N_x's. Then A is the union of these finite intersections, each of which has smaller cardinality than A. But the user argues that a finite union of sets with smaller cardinality than A can't equal A if A is infinite. Therefore, contradiction. \n\nHmm. Wait, but in set theory, the union of sets each smaller in cardinality than an infinite set A can sometimes equal A. For example, if A is countably infinite, and each N_x ∩ A is finite, then a finite union of finite sets would be finite, which can't cover A. But if A is uncountably infinite, and each N_x ∩ A is countable, then a finite union of countable sets is countable, which again can't cover A. So perhaps the argument holds because in the case where A is infinite (regardless of its cardinality), each neighborhood intersection reduces the cardinality, and finite union can't recover the original cardinality. Therefore, the proof seems valid. \n\nBut wait, the problem statement just says \"every infinite subset has a complete limit point\". The user's proof uses that if there is no complete limit point, then we can cover X with neighborhoods each missing \"a lot\" of A, leading to a contradiction via compactness. So I think the proof is correct. \n\nAs for the converse: proving that if every infinite subset has a complete limit point, then the space is compact. That might be trickier. The user mentions references to Kelley and Alexandroff, but since they don't have access, they need hints. Let me recall some topology concepts. A space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. To show the converse, assume that every infinite subset has a complete limit point, and then show that the space is compact. How to approach this?\n\nPerhaps by contrapositive: suppose the space is not compact, then there exists an open cover with no finite subcover. Then use that to construct an infinite subset with no complete limit point. Alternatively, use some characterization of compactness in terms of accumulation points. In metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to being sequentially compact and also to being limit point compact. But here, the condition is stronger: complete limit point, which is more than just a limit point.\n\nWait, in general topology, a space is limit point compact if every infinite subset has a limit point. This is weaker than compactness. But here, the condition is stronger: every infinite subset has a *complete* limit point. So maybe this stronger condition is equivalent to compactness. \n\nTo prove the converse, suppose X is not compact. Then there exists an open cover with no finite subcover. Using this, construct an infinite subset A without a complete limit point. Maybe by considering a closed discrete subset? Or using a sequence of points where each point is \"far\" from the previous ones in some sense. \n\nAlternatively, think in terms of accumulation points. If every infinite subset has a complete limit point, then every infinite subset has a point such that every neighborhood contains the entire cardinality of the subset. That seems very strong. Maybe this implies that the space is closed and every open cover has a finite subcover. \n\nBut I need to structure the problem as per the user's format. The original problem is to prove that in a compact space, every infinite subset has a complete limit point. The user's proof seems correct. The converse would be to show that if every infinite subset has a complete limit point, then the space is compact. \n\nSo, for the formatted part, the user wants the assumptions and the problem statement. Let's see the original problem again. The title states that (X,T) is compact iff every infinite subset has a complete limit point. The question is asking to prove the forward direction and is unsure about the converse. \n\nIn the problem statement, the user starts by defining a complete limit point. Then wants to prove that if (X,T) is compact, then every infinite subset A has a complete limit point in X. Then the user provides a proof attempt and asks if it's correct, then asks about the converse. \n\nBut according to the format example, we need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. In the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. \n\nSo here, the problem in the title is the equivalence: compact iff every infinite subset has a complete limit point. The question is about proving both directions, but the user's specific problem is the forward direction (compact implies every infinite subset has a complete limit point) and the converse. \n\nBut the user's main question is to check their proof for the forward direction and get help with the converse. However, according to the task, I need to structure the problem as per the format, which is Assumptions and Problem. The original problem is an equivalence, but the user is focusing on proving one direction and the converse. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem as stated in the title is the equivalence, but the user's specific question is about the forward direction (proving compact implies every infinite subset has a complete limit point) and the converse. However, when structuring, we have to present the problem as given, filtered. The user's own problem is to verify their proof of the forward direction and get help with the converse. \n\nBut the original instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example given took the original problem, extracted assumptions and problem. So here, the problem is the title: Prove that (X,T) is compact iff every infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X. But the user's specific question is about their proof of the forward direction and the converse. However, the format requires listing assumptions and the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the main problem is the equivalence. The user is asking if their proof of compact => complete limit point is correct, and how to approach the converse. But according to the format, we need to present the problem as the original question's problem, stripped of the proof attempt and other details. \n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in that case, the problem was restructured with assumptions and problem. \n\nIn the current case, the problem in the title is the equivalence. But the user's question is about proving both directions. However, the user's own proof attempt is for the forward direction, and they are asking for verification and help with the converse. \n\nBut according to the task, the assistant is to structure the problem as per the format, which is Assumption and Problem. So for the forward direction: \n\nAssumptions: \n(X, T) is a compact topological space,\nA is an infinite subset of X.\n\nProblem: \nProve that A has a complete limit point in X.\n\nBut the original problem is an equivalence, so perhaps the full problem is to prove the equivalence. However, the user is focusing on one direction. \n\nBut the example given only took one direction (the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under assumptions on n). So perhaps here, the problem is to prove that compactness implies every infinite subset has a complete limit point, with the assumptions being that (X,T) is compact and A is an infinite subset. But the original problem's title is the equivalence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated by the user is the equivalence, so the assumptions would be that (X,T) is a topological space, and the problem is to show that it's compact iff every infinite subset has a complete limit point. But the example had line-by-line assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, the assumptions for the forward direction would be: \n\n- (X, T) is a compact topological space,\n- A is an infinite subset of X.\n\nProblem: Prove that A has a complete limit point in X.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the variables are the space and the subset. However, the problem is about an equivalence, so maybe the problem is structured as two parts. But the format requires one problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the equivalence, so assumptions would include properties of the space and the subsets. But since the example had a one-direction implication with specific assumptions, perhaps here the problem is the equivalence, and assumptions are the conditions on the space. \n\nWait, the original problem is: Prove that (X,T) is compact if and only if every infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X. So the problem is an equivalence, and the assumptions are the definitions of compactness and complete limit point. But according to the example, assumptions are specific conditions. \n\nHmm, the example's assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is an equivalence, so the two directions. But the user is asking about both directions. However, in the format, perhaps we need to structure it as two separate problems? Or since the problem is an equivalence, it's one problem with two directions. \n\nBut the user's own question includes their proof of the forward direction and asks about the converse. However, the task is to structure the original problem (from the user's post) into assumptions and problem. The user's original post's problem is the equivalence stated in the title. So the problem is to prove that (X,T) is compact iff every infinite subset has a complete limit point. \n\nBut to structure this, we need to list the assumptions. The assumptions would be: \n\n- (X, T) is a topological space,\n- For the forward direction: (X, T) is compact,\n- For the converse: Every infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X.\n\nBut the format requires a single problem. However, since it's an equivalence, maybe split into two parts. Alternatively, present the entire equivalence as the problem, with the assumptions being the definitions. \n\nBut the example had specific assumptions. So perhaps in this case, the problem is the equivalence, and the assumptions are the properties for each direction. Wait, but the example only had one direction. Maybe the user wants the problem structured as two separate parts. However, the original problem is a single equivalence. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me check the example again. The example took a problem that was to prove divisibility by 91 under certain assumptions on n. The original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. \n\nIn the current case, the problem is an equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are that (X,T) is a topological space, and the problem is to prove that it is compact if and only if every infinite subset has a complete limit point. But the example's assumptions were more specific. Alternatively, since the problem is an equivalence, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions. \n\nBut according to the instructions, \"filter the unrelated informations\". The original post has the user's proof attempt and questions about the converse, references, etc. So we need to extract the core problem. The core problem is the equivalence stated in the title. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be: \n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is a topological space,\n(X, T) is compact,\nA is an infinite subset of X.\n\nProblem: \nProve that every infinite subset A of X has a complete limit point in X.\n\nBut wait, that's only the forward direction. The converse would be: \n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is a topological space,\nEvery infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X.\n\nProblem: \nProve that (X, T) is compact.\n\nBut the original problem is an equivalence, so perhaps the problem is presented as two separate implications. However, the user's example only had one problem. Maybe the user expects to have the equivalence as a single problem. But the example had a one-direction implication. \n\nAlternatively, given that the original title is the equivalence, perhaps the problem is to prove the equivalence, with assumptions being the two conditions. But I think the proper way here is to present the problem as the equivalence, but since the example had a one-direction implication, maybe split into two parts. \n\nHowever, the user's main question is about their proof of the forward direction and the converse. But according to the task, the assistant should format the problem as per the example, which lists assumptions and problem. \n\nTherefore, considering the original problem is to prove the equivalence, but the user's specific focus is on the forward direction (compact implies complete limit point) and the converse. However, the example format was for a single problem. So perhaps the answer should have two parts: one for each direction. \n\nBut the instructions say to structure the problem as per the format. The example was a single problem. Hence, maybe here, the problem is the equivalence, and the assumptions are that (X,T) is a topological space. But that seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is the equivalence, and the assumptions are the two conditions: compactness and every infinite subset having a complete limit point. But in an equivalence, both are part of the problem statement. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, the user's example had specific assumptions leading to the problem. Here, since it's an equivalence, perhaps list the assumptions as the properties for each direction. But I think the safest way is to present the problem as stated in the title, with the assumptions being the topological space and the definitions. \n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are specific conditions. For the forward direction, the assumption is that the space is compact and A is an infinite subset. The problem is to prove A has a complete limit point. For the converse, the assumption is that every infinite subset has a complete limit point, and the problem is to prove the space is compact. \n\nGiven that, maybe structure it as two separate problems. However, the user's original question is about the equivalence. But the task is to structure the problem as per the example. Since the example handled a single problem, perhaps here, since the original problem is an equivalence, we need to split it into two directions. \n\nAlternatively, present the entire equivalence as the problem, with assumptions being the topological space. But that might not fit the example's style. \n\nGiven the example, the assistant should list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. For the forward direction: \n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is a topological space,\n(X, T) is compact,\nA is an infinite subset of X.\n\nProblem: \nProve that A has a complete limit point in X.\n\nFor the converse: \n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is a topological space,\nEvery infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X.\n\nProblem: \nProve that (X, T) is compact.\n\nBut since the original problem is an equivalence, perhaps both directions are part of the same problem. However, the example had a single implication. To adhere to the example's format, perhaps the user wants each direction as a separate problem. But the original title is the equivalence. \n\nAlternatively, given the user's proof attempt is for the forward direction and they're asking about the converse, maybe structure it as two separate problems. \n\nBut the instructions say to structure \"the problem\" as per the format. The original problem is the equivalence. Therefore, perhaps the problem is the equivalence, and the assumptions are the two conditions. But that's not how the example was structured. \n\nHmm. Given the example, when the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, the assumptions were specific conditions on n. Here, for the equivalence, the assumptions would be the two conditions (compactness and the complete limit point property) but since it's an equivalence, they are part of the problem statement. \n\nPerhaps the way to handle this is to structure each direction separately. But the user's original post is about both directions. However, in the example, only one direction was given. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to follow the example's structure for each direction. So for the forward direction:\n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is a compact topological space,\nA is an infinite subset of X.\n\nProblem: \nProve that A has a complete limit point in X.\n\nAnd for the converse:\n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is a topological space,\nEvery infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X.\n\nProblem: \nProve that (X, T) is compact.\n\nBut the original problem is an equivalence, so combining both. However, the example didn't combine two directions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the equivalence, and the assumptions are that (X,T) is a topological space. But the example had specific assumptions. \n\nI think the correct approach here is to present each direction as a separate problem, as the user is asking about both. However, the original instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying a single problem. Therefore, perhaps the answer will have two entries: one for each direction. \n\nBut according to the user's example, it's one problem. So maybe the answer should be two separate formatted problems. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem\" (singular). Therefore, perhaps the answer should be the forward direction as per the user's question. \n\nWait, the user's question starts with the title stating the equivalence, then in the body, they provide their proof for compact => complete limit point and ask if it's correct, then ask about the converse. So the main problem they're presenting is the equivalence, but their specific queries are about both directions. \n\nHowever, the task is to structure the problem as per the example. The example extracted the core problem from a longer post. So here, the core problem is the equivalence in the title. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is a topological space.\n\nProblem: \nProve that (X, T) is compact if and only if every infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X.\n\nBut that's too vague, as the assumptions are just that it's a topological space, and the problem is the equivalence. The example had specific assumptions about n. Alternatively, maybe for each direction:\n\nForward direction:\n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is compact,\nA is an infinite subset of X.\n\nProblem: \nProve that A has a complete limit point in X.\n\nConverse:\n\nAssumption: \nEvery infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X.\n\nProblem: \nProve that (X, T) is compact.\n\nBut the user's original problem includes both directions. However, the example only had one problem. Given that, perhaps the answer should present both directions as separate problems. \n\nBut since the user's example had one problem, maybe the assistant should follow that. But the original problem is an equivalence. The example had an implication. So perhaps the assistant can only do one direction, but the user's problem is an equivalence. This is conflicting. \n\nGiven the instructions, the assistant is supposed to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The unrelated information here is the user's proof attempt, the references, etc. The core problem is the equivalence in the title. So the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is a topological space.\n\nProblem: \nProve that (X, T) is compact if and only if every infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions should list specific conditions. In the example, n was an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the topological space is the setting. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- (X, T) is a topological space.\n\nBut that's just the setting. The problem is the equivalence. However, the example's assumptions were specific conditions on the variables in the problem. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is an equivalence, there are no additional assumptions beyond the topological space. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: \n(X, T) is a topological space.\n\nProblem: \nProve that (X, T) is compact if and only if every infinite subset of X has a complete limit point in X.\n\nThis seems reasonable. The assumption is that we're working within a topological space, and the problem is to establish the equivalence. \n\nHowever, the user's own proof attempt for the forward direction seems correct, but they're unsure. The converse is what they're clueless about. But according to the task, the assistant is to structure the problem, not answer it. \n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be as above. But let me check the example again. The example extracted specific assumptions from the problem. In this case, the problem is an equivalence, so there are no specific assumptions beyond the general setting (topological space). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$(X, \\mathscr T)$ is a topological space.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $(X, \\mathscr T)$ is compact if and only if every infinite subset of $X$ has a complete limit point in $X$.",
