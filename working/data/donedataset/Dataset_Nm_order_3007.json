    "Content": "Let $F: \\mathbf C \\to \\mathbf D, G: \\mathbf C \\to \\mathbf E$ be functors. Assume that $\\mathbf C$ is small, $\\mathbf D$ is locally small and $\\mathbf E$ is cocomplete. Then, I can compute the left Kan extension $\\mathrm{Lan}_F(G)$ as a coend: \\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{Lan}_F(G) = \\int^c \\mathbf D(F(c),-)\\cdot G(c). \n\\end{equation} Now, assume that $F$ is fully faithful. Then, if I consider $\\mathrm{Lan}_F(G) \\circ F$ , I can compute: \\begin{equation}\n\\mathrm{Lan}_F(G) \\circ F = \\int^c \\mathbf D(F(c),F(-)) \\cdot G(c) \\cong \\int^c \\mathbf C(c,-) \\cdot G(c) \\cong G,\n\\end{equation} where the last isomorphism comes frome the co-Yoneda lemma. Now, what I want to show is not only that $\\mathrm{Lan}_F(G) \\circ F \\cong G$ , but that the unit of the Kan extension \\begin{equation}\n\\eta_G \\colon G \\to \\mathrm{Lan}_F(G) \\circ F\n\\end{equation} is an isomorphism. I think that the above chain of isomorphisms actually gives the unit $\\eta_G$ (MacLane in X.4.2 gives an explicit formula for that). Is there a \"nice\" proof of this? Or, a nice direct proof that $\\eta$ is an isomorphism? I'm thinking of something which avoids trivial but tedious computations. This is the advantage of using end and coends, after all.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a useful trick for dealing with this. The following appears as Lemma 1.3 in [Johnstone and Moerdijk, Local maps of toposes ]. Proposition. Given an adjunction\n$$L \\dashv R : \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{C}$$\nif $\\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{C}} \\cong R L$ (as functors) then the unit $\\eta : \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{C}} \\Rightarrow R L$ is (also) a natural isomorphism. Proof. Let $\\mu = R \\epsilon L$, where $\\epsilon : L R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{D}}$ is the counit. Then (by the triangle identities), we have a monad. We can transport this structure along any natural isomorphism $\\theta : \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{D}} \\Rightarrow R L$, so that e.g. \n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{C}} & \\overset{\\theta}{\\to} & \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{C}} \\\\\n{\\scriptstyle \\eta} \\downarrow & & \\downarrow {\\scriptstyle \\eta'} \\\\\n\\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{C}} & \\underset{\\theta}{\\to} & R L\n\\end{array}$$\ncommutes. But (using naturality) any comonad structure $(\\eta', \\mu')$ on $\\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{C}}$ must consist of natural isomorphisms, so we deduce that the original $\\eta$ and $\\mu$ are also natural isomorphisms.　◼",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and parse the Math Stack Exchange question into Assumptions and Problem sections. The example they provided shows that each assumption should list one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that the unit of the left Kan extension of a functor F is an isomorphism when F is fully faithful. The user mentions several conditions: F is fully faithful, C is small, D is locally small, E is cocomplete, and they use the coend formula for the left Kan extension.\n\nLooking at the example given, assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem, I should list each condition separately. The original problem states that F is fully faithful, C is small, D is locally small, and E is cocomplete. Each of these should be separate assumptions. \n\nThe problem then is to show that the unit η_G is an isomorphism. The user also mentions avoiding tedious computations and using properties like co-Yoneda. But according to the format, the problem statement should be concise, just stating what needs to be proven. \n\nWait, the example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But here, the assumptions are about the categories and functors. So each category's property is a separate assumption. Let me check again:\n\n- C is small\n- D is locally small\n- E is cocomplete\n- F is fully faithful\n- F: C → D, G: C → E are functors\n\nBut in the original problem, the user wrote \"Assume that C is small, D is locally small and E is cocomplete.\" So each of those three are separate. Then F is fully faithful. So each of these should be separate lines in assumptions. The problem is to show that the unit η_G is an isomorphism. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- C is a small category\n- D is a locally small category\n- E is a cocomplete category\n- F: C → D is a fully faithful functor\n- G: C → E is a functor\n\nProblem: Prove that the unit η_G: G → Lan_F(G) ∘ F of the left Kan extension is an isomorphism.\n\nI think that's the correct breakdown. Each assumption is a separate condition on the categories or the functors. The problem is about proving the unit is an isomorphism.",
