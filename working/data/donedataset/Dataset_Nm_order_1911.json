    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem is to prove that the multiplicative inverse of an integer a modulo m exists if and only if a and m are coprime. First, I need to make sure I understand what each part means.\n\nSo, a multiplicative inverse modulo m means there exists some integer x such that a * x ≡ 1 mod m. That means when you multiply a by x and divide by m, the remainder is 1. The \"if and only if\" part means I have to prove two directions: \n\n1. If a and m are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), then there exists an inverse.\n2. If there exists an inverse, then a and m must be coprime.\n\nStarting with the first direction: Assume gcd(a, m) = 1. I remember Bézout's identity states that if gcd(a, m) = 1, then there exist integers x and y such that a*x + m*y = 1. If I rearrange this equation modulo m, the term m*y becomes 0 mod m, so we get a*x ≡ 1 mod m. Therefore, x is the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow the converse: Suppose there exists an integer x such that a*x ≡ 1 mod m. Then, by definition, m divides (a*x - 1), so there exists some integer k where a*x - m*k = 1. This is a linear combination of a and m equal to 1. By Bézout's identity, the gcd of a and m must divide any linear combination of a and m. Since the combination equals 1, gcd(a, m) must divide 1. The only positive integer dividing 1 is 1 itself, so gcd(a, m) = 1. Therefore, a and m are coprime.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any edge cases. For example, if m is 1, then every number is congruent modulo 1, but since a and 1 are always coprime, the inverse exists trivially. If m is 0? Wait, modulo 0 isn't defined, so m must be at least 2? Wait, actually, the modulus m is typically defined as a positive integer greater than 1. But maybe the original problem allows m to be any integer except 0. Hmm, the problem statement just says \"modulo m\", so maybe m is a positive integer greater than 1. But the problem didn't specify, so I should note that m must be a positive integer greater than 1 for the concept of modulo to make sense. However, the user's original problem might not have specified that, but in the assumptions, maybe we need to include that m is a positive integer greater than 1. But looking back at the example provided, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, and the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe in the problem here, the assumptions should include that m is an integer greater than 1, and a is an integer. Wait, the problem says \"the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m exists if and only if a and m are coprime\". So standard conditions here would be that m is a positive integer greater than 1, and a is an integer. But in the problem statement, do they mention that m is positive? The question on Math Stack Exchange might not have, but in standard modular arithmetic, modulus is positive and greater than 1. So perhaps in the assumptions, we need to include m is an integer, m > 1, a is an integer, and then the problem is as stated. However, looking at the example given in the user's instruction, the assumptions listed were \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" So each assumption is a single condition on one object. Therefore, for this problem, the assumptions should list that m is an integer, m > 1, a is an integer, and perhaps other conditions. Wait, but the problem is about the existence of the inverse, so maybe m must be a positive integer greater than 1, and a is an integer. But the user's example had two assumptions for the same object n. So perhaps for the multiplicative inverse problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is an integer.\n- m is an integer.\n- m > 1.\n\nBut the problem might not require m > 1, but in the context of modular inverses, modulus is usually taken as positive and greater than 1. So perhaps these are the implicit assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the original question didn't specify m > 1, but the answer would need to consider m being a positive integer. Hmm. Let me check the original problem again. The user's example is from Math Stack Exchange, the title is \"Prove that the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m exists if and only if a and m are coprime.\" The question body just repeats the title. So the original problem probably didn't specify further details, so the user is supposed to infer the standard assumptions. In standard number theory, when discussing modular inverses, m is a positive integer greater than 1, and a is an integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is an integer.\n- m is an integer.\n- m > 1.\n\nBut wait, m could be 1, but modulo 1, every number is congruent to 0, so the inverse would not exist unless a is congruent to 1 mod 1, which it always is, but in that case, all numbers are congruent to 0 mod 1, so maybe the inverse isn't defined. So m must be greater than 1. So I think the assumptions are:\n\n- a is an integer.\n- m is a positive integer.\n- m > 1.\n\nTherefore, the problem is structured with these assumptions. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for the problem, the assumptions are:\n\na is an integer,\nm is a positive integer,\nm > 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m exists if and only if a and m are coprime.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't mention m > 1. However, in mathematical terms, modulus is generally considered positive and greater than 1. So maybe the user's problem assumes that. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is an integer,\nm is an integer,\nm > 1.\n\nBut m must be positive, so maybe \"m is a positive integer\" and \"m > 1\". Alternatively, if m is a positive integer greater than 1, then combining those into two assumptions: \"m is a positive integer\" and \"m > 1\". But the example had two separate conditions for the same object. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and then in the assumptions, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So perhaps in this case, the original problem's assumptions would include that m is a positive integer, m > 1, and a is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require m > 1, but since modulo inverses are typically considered for m ≥ 2, but if m = 1, then every number is congruent to 0 mod 1, but 0 and 1 are coprime, but 0 mod 1 doesn't have an inverse. Wait, but if m = 1, then any a is congruent to 0 mod 1. The inverse would need to satisfy 0 * x ≡ 1 mod 1, which is impossible. So m = 1 is excluded. Therefore, the assumption is m > 1. But the problem might not specify that, so as a knowledgeable professor, I should include that in the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\na is an integer,\nm is a positive integer,\nm > 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m exists if and only if a and m are coprime.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. The problem is as stated.",
