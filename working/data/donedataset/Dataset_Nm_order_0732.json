    "Content": "Could anyone help me prove that $2,3,1+\\sqrt{-5}$ and $1-\\sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$? As $6=2*3=(1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5})$ so $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a UFD. Therefore is not a PID or euclidean domain",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The standard method is: Define a function $N\\colon \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]\\to\\mathbb{Z}$ by $N(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = (a+b\\sqrt{-5})(a-b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2+5b^2$. Prove that $N(\\alpha\\beta) = N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$ for all $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$. Conclude that if $\\alpha|\\beta$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, then $N(\\alpha)|N(\\beta)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Prove that $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ is a unit if and only if $N(\\alpha)=1$. Show that there are no elements in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ with $N(\\alpha)=2$ or $N(\\alpha)=3$. Conclude that $2$, $3$, $1+\\sqrt{-5}$, and $1-\\sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible. This is a common technique for dealing with rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$, where $\\theta$ is an algebraic integer. It can also be done directly, though it is a bit more laborious. Here's what I came up with on the fly: Assume that $(a+b\\sqrt{-5})(c+d\\sqrt{-5}) = 2$. Then $ac+5bd = 2$ and $ad+bc=0$. If $a=0$, then we must have $c=0$ (since $bc=0$ but we cannot have $a=b=0$), but then $5bd=2$ is impossible. Thus, $a\\neq0$ and $c\\neq 0$. If $b=0$, then $d=0$, so the factorization occurs in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and is trivial; symmetrically if $d=0$. So we may assume that all of $a,b,c,d$ are nonzero. Then $ad=-bc$, so $2d=acd + 5bd^2 = -bc^2 + 5bd^2 = b(5d^2 - c^2)$. If $b$ is odd, then $b|d$, so writing $d=bk$ we get $abk + bc=0$, so $ak+c=0$, thus $c=-ak$. Hence $c+d\\sqrt{-5} = -ak+bk\\sqrt{-5} = k(-a+b\\sqrt{-5})$. But this gives\n$$2 = (a+b\\sqrt{-5})(c+d\\sqrt{-5}) = k(a+b\\sqrt{-5})(-a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = -k(a^2+5b^2).$$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are both nonzero, $a^2+5b^2$ is at least 6, which is impossible. So $b$ is even, $b=2b'$. Then $b'(5d^2-c^2) = d$, so setting $5d^2-c^2 = k$ we have \n$$a+b\\sqrt{-5} = a+2b'\\sqrt{-5},\\qquad c+d\\sqrt{-5} = c+kb'\\sqrt{-5}.$$\nFrom $ad=-bc$ we get $ak=-2c$. If $a$ is even, then we have $a=2a'$, so\n$$2 = (2a'+2b'\\sqrt{-5})(c+d\\sqrt{-5}) = 2(a'+b'\\sqrt{-5})(c+d\\sqrt{-5}),$$\nwhich yields that $c+d\\sqrt{-5}$ is a unit (in fact, this is impossible with $c$ and $d$ both nonzero, but that doesn't matter). If $a$ is odd, then $k$ is even and $c=ak'$, with $2k'=k$. So now we have\n$$\\begin{align*}\n2 &= (a+b\\sqrt{-5})(c+d\\sqrt{-5})\\\\\n&= (a + 2b'\\sqrt{-5})(ak' + 2b'k'\\sqrt{-5})\\\\\n&= k'(a+2b'\\sqrt{-5})(a+2b'\\sqrt{-5})\\\\\n&= k'(a^2 - 20b'^2) + 4ab'\\sqrt{-5}\n\\end{align*}$$\nwhich implies $a=0$ or $b'=0$ (hence $b=0$), contradicting our hypotheses. Thus, the only factorizations of $2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ are trivial. (And you can probably see why the \"standard method\" is so much better....)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the elements 2, 3, 1+√-5, and 1−√-5 are irreducible in the ring ℤ[√−5]. First, I need to recall what it means for an element to be irreducible in a ring. \n\nIn a ring R, an element a is irreducible if it is non-zero, not a unit, and whenever a = bc for some b, c ∈ R, then either b or c is a unit. So, for each of these elements, I need to show that they can't be factored into two non-unit elements.\n\nLet me start with the element 2. Suppose 2 can be factored as 2 = αβ where α, β ∈ ℤ[√−5]. I need to show that either α or β must be a unit. The norm in ℤ[√−5] is N(a + b√−5) = a² + 5b². The norm is multiplicative, so N(2) = N(α)N(β) = 4. Therefore, the possible norms of α and β are divisors of 4. The divisors are 1, 2, 4. But in ℤ[√−5], the norm of an element is a² + 5b². Let's check possible norms:\n\n- N = 1: This would mean a² +5b² =1, which only happens if a=±1 and b=0. So the only elements with norm 1 are 1 and -1, which are units.\n\n- N = 2: Solve a² +5b² =2. Testing integers: a=±1, then 1 +5b²=2 ⇒ 5b²=1 ⇒ b²=1/5, not integer. Similarly, a=0 gives 5b²=2, no solution. So there's no element with norm 2.\n\n- N =4: Similarly, possible if a=±2, b=0: 4 +0=4. Or a=±1, b=±1: 1 +5=6 ≠4. a=0, b=±1: 0 +5=5 ≠4. So only elements with norm 4 are ±2. Therefore, if N(α)N(β)=4, then possible norms are 1*4 or 2*2. But since there are no elements with norm 2, the only possibility is N(α)=1 and N(β)=4, or vice versa. Thus, either α or β is a unit. Hence, 2 is irreducible.\n\nSimilarly for 3. Let’s factor 3 = αβ. Then N(3) =9, so N(α)N(β)=9. Possible norms: 1,3,9. Check if there are elements with norm 3. Solve a² +5b²=3. Possible a=±1, then 1 +5b²=3 ⇒ 5b²=2, no solution. a=0 gives 5b²=3, nope. So no elements with norm 3. Thus, N(α) and N(β) must be 1 and 9. So one of α or β is a unit. Hence, 3 is irreducible.\n\nNow for 1+√−5. Suppose it factors as αβ. Then N(1+√−5) =1² +5*(1)^2=6. So N(α)N(β)=6. Possible norms: 1,2,3,6. But we know there are no elements with norm 2 or 3. Thus, the only possible factorizations are 1*6 or 6*1. But since 6 can't be achieved as a norm here (since the only norms possible are of the form a²+5b²). Wait, but N=6 would require a² +5b²=6. Let's check: a=1, then 1 +5b²=6 ⇒5b²=5 ⇒b²=1 ⇒b=±1. So elements like 1 +√−5 or 1 -√−5 have norm 6. Wait, but 1+√−5 is the element itself. Wait, but if we factor 1+√−5 = αβ, then N(α) and N(β) must multiply to 6. But if there are no elements with norm 2 or 3, then the only possibilities are 1*6. So if α has norm 1, then it's a unit. If β has norm 6, then β is an associate of 1+√−5. Therefore, the only factorizations are trivial. Thus, 1+√−5 is irreducible.\n\nSimilarly for 1−√−5. The same logic applies. If it factors into αβ, then norms multiply to 6. Since norms 2 and 3 are impossible, one of the factors must have norm 1 (unit) or 6. Hence, same conclusion.\n\nI need to make sure that in the assumptions, each is applied to one object. The problem states that we need to prove each of these elements is irreducible in ℤ[√−5]. The original problem mentions that ℤ[√−5] is not a UFD, but that's given as context. The user wants the assumptions structured as per the format.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove four elements are irreducible. Each element is an element of ℤ[√−5]. So the assumptions would be each of these elements being in the ring. But perhaps the key assumptions are the ring structure. Wait, but the problem as stated in the user's example lists the conditions on the variable. Here, the problem is about elements in ℤ[√−5]. But maybe the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the elements being in that ring. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- 2 is an element of ℤ[√−5].\n\n- 3 is an element of ℤ[√−5].\n\n- 1+√−5 is an element of ℤ[√−5].\n\n- 1−√−5 is an element of ℤ[√−5].\n\nBut that seems redundant because the problem is to prove they are irreducible in that ring, so the fact they are elements of the ring is given. Maybe the example's assumption was specific, but here the problem is to prove irreducibility, so the main assumptions are the elements are in the ring. However, perhaps the user's example didn't list the elements as assumptions, but in the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in the problem statement, the user wrote the problem as \"Prove that...\", with the expression. So maybe in this case, the assumptions are that the elements are in the ring, but since the problem is \"prove these elements are irreducible in ℤ[√−5]\", perhaps the only assumption is that each element is considered in the ring ℤ[√−5].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond what is stated. For example, the original problem says \"prove that 2,3,... are irreducible in ℤ[√−5]\". So the assumptions would be:\n\nEach of the elements (2, 3, 1+√−5, 1−√−5) is considered in the ring ℤ[√−5].\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. Therefore, each element is in the ring, and the problem is to prove irreducibility. But in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, perhaps the assumptions are each element being in the ring. However, since the problem is about irreducibility in that ring, perhaps the main assumption is that the ring is ℤ[√−5], and the elements are part of it. However, the user's example structured the assumptions as properties of the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the elements are given as part of the problem. Maybe the assumptions here are the properties required for irreducibility: the ring is an integral domain (since irreducibility is defined in domains). But ℤ[√−5] is a ring but not a UFD, but it is an integral domain. But perhaps that's implicit. Alternatively, the problem doesn't state any assumptions beyond the elements being in the ring. Since the user's example listed the variable's properties, here perhaps the assumptions are each element is in ℤ[√−5], and we need to list each element as a separate assumption. But that seems redundant, but following the example, which listed each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n2 is an element of ℤ[√−5],\n3 is an element of ℤ[√−5],\n1+√−5 is an element of ℤ[√−5],\n1−√−5 is an element of ℤ[√−5].\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary because the problem statement already says they are in ℤ[√−5]. Alternatively, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the elements being in the ring, which is part of the problem statement. The example given by the user had an original problem where the assumption was on n (the variable), but in this problem, the elements are explicitly given. So perhaps the problem as formatted would have the assumptions listed as each element's membership in the ring. But perhaps the user's example didn't include that. Wait, in the example, the assumption was about n being integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions in the problem. In the current problem, the user's question is to prove that certain elements are irreducible in ℤ[√−5], so the assumptions are that each of these elements is in the ring. So each element is in the ring. But since the problem is to prove irreducibility in that ring, maybe the assumptions are implicit. However, following the format strictly, each assumption should list one property per line. Maybe the problem as formatted should list each element as being in the ring. Alternatively, if the problem statement already mentions the ring, maybe the assumptions are not needed beyond the problem statement. But in the example, even though the problem mentions \"for every integer n\", the assumption was listed as \"n is an integer\". So in this case, the problem is \"prove that these elements are irreducible in ℤ[√−5]\", so the assumption is that each element is in the ring. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n2 ∈ ℤ[√−5],\n3 ∈ ℤ[√−5],\n1+√−5 ∈ ℤ[√−5],\n1−√−5 ∈ ℤ[√−5].\n\nBut that seems redundant because the problem already states they are in the ring. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions beyond what's in the problem. However, the example included assumptions even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Therefore, following the example's structure, we should list the elements as being in the ring as assumptions. So each line is one element in the ring. Therefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions listing each element in the ring, and the problem is to prove they are irreducible. Alternatively, maybe the key assumption is that ℤ[√−5] is the ring in consideration, but the example didn't include the ring as an assumption. Hmm. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the user's formatted problem added that as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that seems incorrect. Because 91 is 13*7, and if n is divisible by 7, then perhaps the problem is easier. But maybe in the example, the user made a mistake, but regardless, following that example, the assumptions were properties of the variable n. In the current problem, the variables are the elements 2,3, etc., and the ring. But the problem is to prove they are irreducible in the ring. So perhaps the assumptions are that each element is in the ring. Therefore, each assumption line is one element being in the ring. So:\n\nAssumption:\n2 ∈ ℤ[√−5],\n3 ∈ ℤ[√−5],\n1+√−5 ∈ ℤ[√−5],\n1−√−5 ∈ ℤ[√−5].\n\nProblem:\nProve that 2, 3, 1+√−5, and 1−√−5 are irreducible in ℤ[√−5].\n\nBut maybe that's redundant, but following the example's structure, even if the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", the assumption was listed as \"n is an integer\". Similarly, here, even though the problem states the elements are in the ring, we list each element's membership as an assumption. So that's the formatted problem.",
