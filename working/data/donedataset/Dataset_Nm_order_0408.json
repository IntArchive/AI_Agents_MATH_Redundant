    "Content": "$ p(x)\\in\\mathbb{R[X]} $ is a polynomial of degree $n$ with no real\n  roots. Show that: $$\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\dfrac{(p'(x))^2}{(p'(x))^2+(p(x))^2}\\,dx \\leq n^{3/2}\\pi.$$ It's easy to see that the degree of $ p$ has to be even. For $n=2$ this integral is at most $2\\pi$. For $n>2$ the maximum value of this integral is obtained when all the imaginary parts of the roots of $p(x)$ tend to $0$, but I couldn't go further. Any help would be appreciated, thanks. Edits by David Speyer: It seems very likely now that the optimum bound is $n \\pi$, not $n^{3/2} \\pi$. As pointed out in the comments below, and further in 23rd's question , this is the value we get in the limit where $p$ has double roots on the real axis. It seems likely that  moving the roots of $p$ away from the real axis can only make the integral less. Write the roots of $p$ as $a_j \\pm i b_j$, so $p(x) = \\prod ((x-a_j)^2 + b_j^2)$ and \n$$\\frac{p'(x)}{p(x)} = \\sum \\frac{2 (x-a_j)}{(x-a_j)^2 + b_j^2}.\\quad (\\ast)$$ \nSo making the $b_j$ larger tends to make $p'(x)/p(x)$ smaller, which makes the integral smaller. But this argument is not rigorous, because the terms of $(\\ast)$ can have both positive and negative sign, so it could be that making the individual terms closer to $0$ makes the absolute value of $(\\ast)$ larger. \nI don't see how to beat this issue easily. Thus, I'm putting up a bounty for proving or disproving $$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\dfrac{(p'(x))^2}{(p'(x))^2+(p(x))^2}\\,dx \\leq n\\pi.$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Without loss of generality, we may assume that $p$ is monic. Since $p$ has no real roots, $n=2m$ for some $m\\ge 1$, and there exist  quadratic monic polynomials $q_1,\\dots,q_m$ with no real roots such that $p=\\prod_{k=1}^m q_k$. Therefore, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $$ \\left(\\frac{p'}{p}\\right)^2=\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{q_k'}{q_k}\\right)^2\\le m\\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^m \\left(\\frac{q_k'}{q_k}\\right)^2. \\tag{1}$$\nDenote $f(t):=\\frac{t}{1+t}$ for $t\\ge 0$. Note that $f$ is increasing and $f(s+t)\\le f(s)+f(t)$. Then from $(1)$ it follows that $$\\frac{p'^2}{p'^2+p^2}=f\\left(\\left(\\frac{p'}{p}\\right)^2\\right)\\le \\sum_{k=1}^m f\\left(m\\cdot\\left(\\frac{q_k'}{q_k}\\right)^2\\right). \\tag{2}$$\nFor each $k$, since $q_k$ has no real roots, there exist $a_k\\in\\mathbb R$ and $c_k>0$ such that $q_k(x)=(x-a_k)^2+c_k$. Therefore, $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}f\\left(m\\cdot\\left(\\frac{q_k'(x)}{q_k(x)}\\right)^2\\right)dx\\le \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f\\left( \\frac{4m}{(x-a_k)^2}\\right)dx=2\\sqrt{m}\\cdot\\pi.  \\tag{3}$$\nCombining $(2)$ and  $(3)$, we obtain that\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{p'^2(x)}{p'^2(x)+p^2(x)}dx\\le 2^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\cdot n^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\cdot\\pi.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original problem again carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"On the inequality $ \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{(p'(x))^2}{(p'(x))^2+(p(x))^2}\\,dx \\le n^{3/2}\\pi.$\"\n\nThe user states that $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ with no real roots and wants to show that the integral is less than or equal to $n^{3/2}\\pi$. However, there are edits by David Speyer suggesting that the optimal bound might be $n\\pi$ instead. The problem mentions that for $n=2$, the integral is at most $2\\pi$, and for higher degrees, the maximum seems approached when roots' imaginary parts tend to zero. The user also discusses roots as $a_j \\pm i b_j$ and how increasing $b_j$ might affect the integral.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states:\n\n1. $p(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}[X]$: So p is a real polynomial.\n2. The polynomial has degree $n$.\n3. It has no real roots. So all roots are complex and come in conjugate pairs since coefficients are real. Hence, the degree must be even. The user mentions that \"it's easy to see the degree has to be even,\" which is correct because non-real roots come in pairs.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the title and the beginning says \"Show that\" the integral is ≤ n^{3/2}π. However, later edits suggest the bound might be nπ. The user is now offering a bounty for proving or disproving the integral ≤nπ.\n\nSo the original problem as posed by the user is to show the integral is ≤n^{3/2}π, but David Speyer's edit changes the problem to whether the bound is actually nπ. However, the user's original problem is to show n^{3/2}π, but the edited part adds another possible bound.\n\nBut according to the task, I need to structure the problem as per the user's original question, filtering out the unrelated information. Wait, the user's original question is to show the integral ≤n^{3/2}π. However, the edits and comments by others (David Speyer) suggest a different bound. The problem now has a bounty to check for nπ. But the original problem is the one the user wrote, which is the first part. The rest are edits and follow-up discussions.\n\nWait, the user's original question is as follows:\n\n\"Question: $ p(x)\\in\\mathbb{R[X]} $ is a polynomial of degree $n$ with no real roots. Show that: $$\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\dfrac{(p'(x))^2}{(p'(x))^2+(p(x))^2}\\,dx \\leq n^{3/2}\\pi.$$ It's easy to see that the degree of $ p$ has to be even. For $n=2$ this integral is at most $2\\pi$. For $n>2$ the maximum value of this integral is obtained when all the imaginary parts of the roots of $p(x)$ tend to $0$, but I couldn't go further. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.\"\n\nThen David Speyer adds edits suggesting that the bound might be nπ instead. So the problem in the title is the original one, but there is a subsequent discussion. The task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem. The example given by the user includes assumptions, so here the assumptions are:\n\n1. p(x) is a real polynomial.\n2. The degree of p is n.\n3. p has no real roots.\n\nHowever, the user also mentions that the degree has to be even. Wait, but if n is the degree, and p has no real roots, then n must be even. So is that an assumption or a derived condition? The user says \"It's easy to see that the degree of p has to be even.\" So that's a consequence of the assumptions, not an assumption itself. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- p(x) is a real polynomial (element of ℝ[X])\n- p(x) is of degree n\n- p(x) has no real roots\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumption included \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", which was part of the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed the assumption to n divisible by 7. That seems like the user made a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption is \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. But perhaps the example was a mistake, but according to the task, we should follow the format given.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user states that p is a real polynomial of degree n with no real roots. The problem is to show the integral is ≤n^{3/2}π. However, there's a later edit by David Speyer suggesting that the bound might be nπ instead and offering a bounty for that. However, the original problem is still the one presented first. So, according to the instructions, we need to structure the original problem, filtering out unrelated info. So the problem to structure is the original one, not the edited part unless specified.\n\nBut the user's question includes both the original problem and the edit. So perhaps the problem is now to prove either n^{3/2}π or nπ? But the user's own problem is the original, and the edit is a follow-up. The user is now offering a bounty for proving or disproving the nπ bound, but the original problem is to show the integral is ≤n^{3/2}π. Therefore, to structure the original problem as per the user's first statement, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- p(x) is a real polynomial.\n- p(x) has degree n.\n- p(x) has no real roots.\n\nProblem: Show that the integral ∫_{-∞}^{+∞} [ (p’(x))² / ( (p’(x))² + (p(x))² ) ] dx ≤ n^{3/2}π.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an assumption that was later modified. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error in the example. However, perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem lists all the necessary assumptions. So in the current problem, the user's original problem has three main conditions: p is real, degree n, no real roots. So these are the assumptions. The fact that n must be even is a consequence, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions should be those three.\n\nHowever, looking at the problem statement again: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem in the example has assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the example might have been a mistake. But perhaps the user is supposed to list all the conditions given in the problem, even if they are redundant.\n\nIn the current problem, the user states that p(x) is a real polynomial of degree n with no real roots, so the three assumptions. Then the problem is to show the integral is bounded by n^{3/2}π. However, the later edit complicates things. But according to the instructions, we need to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format. The edits and the discussion about David Speyer's conjecture of nπ and the roots approaching the real axis are additional information that might not be necessary for structuring the problem. Therefore, the problem to structure is the original one presented by the user.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- p(x) is a real polynomial.\n- p(x) is of degree n.\n- p(x) has no real roots.\n\nProblem: Show that the integral ∫_{-infty}^{+infty} [ (p’(x))² / ( (p’(x))² + (p(x))² ) ] dx ≤ n^{3/2}π.\n\nBut the user also mentions that for n=2, the integral is at most 2π. However, that's part of their exploration but not part of the problem statement. So we should exclude that. The problem is the inequality to prove.\n\nAdditionally, the user's initial problem says \"Show that: [integral] ≤ n^{3/2}π\". But David Speyer's edit suggests a different bound. However, according to the task, we need to present the problem as originally stated by the user, filtering out the unrelated parts, which would include the subsequent discussion. Therefore, the problem remains as originally stated.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have the three assumptions and the original problem statement.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That seems contradictory, implying that perhaps the example was wrong. But maybe the example was a case where the user made an error. However, according to the current problem, we need to list the assumptions given in the original problem.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $p(x)$ is a real polynomial (element of $\\mathbb{R}[X]$).\n\n- $p(x)$ has degree $n$.\n\n- $p(x)$ has no real roots.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\dfrac{(p'(x))^2}{(p'(x))^2 + (p(x))^2}\\,dx \\leq n^{3/2}\\pi.$$\n\nBut the user also mentions that the degree must be even. However, that's a consequence of having no real roots and being a real polynomial. Since complex roots come in conjugate pairs, the degree is even. But the original problem states the degree is $n$, which must then be even. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state that $n$ is even as an assumption, so perhaps the user assumes that $n$ is even, but in the problem statement, it's just given that $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ with no real roots. Therefore, the necessary assumptions are the three listed above. The fact that $n$ must be even is a derived property, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the three assumptions as given in the problem statement, not the consequences. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\n$p(x)$ is a real polynomial,\n$p(x)$ is of degree $n$,\n$p(x)$ has no real roots.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\dfrac{(p'(x))^2}{(p'(x))^2 + (p(x))^2}\\,dx \\leq n^{3/2}\\pi.$$\n\nHowever, the user later added an edit about the integral being possibly bounded by $n\\pi$, but since the original problem asks to show it's bounded by $n^{3/2}\\pi$, we should structure the original problem. The later discussion is additional context but not part of the main problem statement. Therefore, the answer should be structured with the original assumptions and problem.",
