    "Content": "If $V$ is a linear subspace of $L^\\infty[0,1]$ with $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\leq c\\|f\\|_2$ for all $f\\in V$, then $V$ is finite dimensional. The proof is an explicit calculation: Since $L^\\infty[0,1] \\subset L^2[0,1]$, take $e_1,\\cdots , e_n$ to be $L^2$-orthonormal vectors in $V$. Fix some $x$ in $[0,1]$. We have, for all $y\\in[0,1]$,\n$$\\left|\\sum e_i(x)e_i(y)\\right| \\leq \\left\\|\\sum e_i(x) e_i(\\cdot) \\right\\|_\\infty \\leq c\\left\\|\\sum e_i(x)e_i(\\cdot)\\right\\|_2 = c \\sqrt{ \\sum e_i^2(x)},$$\ntake $y = x$ this implies \n$$\\sum e_i^2(x) \\leq c^2.$$\nIntegrate both side and we get\n$$  n=\\int_0^1 \\sum e_i^2(x) \\leq c^2.$$\nThis proof is simple but it is not really intuitive for me. Could you guys help me with a more functional analysis argument of this? Since for functions in $L^\\infty[0,1]$ we always have $\\|f\\|_2 \\leq  \\|f\\|_\\infty$ , paired with $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\leq c \\|f\\|_2$, this means that the identity map is a continuous bijection between $(V, \\|\\cdot \\|_2)$ and $(V, \\|\\cdot \\|_\\infty)$. Also $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$ are equivalent on $V$. I know any two norms are equivalent in a finite dimensional space, but I dont know if there is anything special about the $L^2$ and $L^\\infty$ norm to make the converse of that true as well.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following functional-analytic proof is an application of the Riesz lemma: a normed space is finite-dimensional if and only if its unit ball is compact, or equivalently, if the identity operator is compact. The following statement is what we want to prove. Proposition . Let $V$ be a vector space of bounded functions on $[0, 1]$ such that there is $c>0$ satisfying $\\lVert f\\rVert_{\\infty}\\le c\\lVert f\\rVert_2$ for all $f\\in V$ . Then $V$ is finite-dimensional. Remark . Notice how we are avoiding the mention of $L^\\infty([0, 1])$ . The reason is that $V$ is a space of functions, whereas $L^\\infty$ is typically defined as a space of equivalence classes of functions, up to almost everywhere equivalence. Proof . For $x\\in [0, 1]$ and $f\\in V$ define the evaluation functional $\\mathrm{ev}_x(f):=f(x).$ (Note: this would not be well-defined on $L^\\infty([0, 1])$ , as mentioned in the remark). The assumption implies that this is a bounded linear functional in the $L^2$ topology. So the Riesz representation theorem yields the existence of $K_x\\in L^2([0, 1])$ such that $$\n\\mathrm{ev}_x(f)=\\langle K_x | f \\rangle_{L^2([0,1])}=\\int_0^1 K(x, y) f(y)\\, dy, $$ where we have let $K(x, \\cdot):=K_x$ . By assumption, $$\n\\lvert \\langle K_x | f \\rangle_{L^2([0,1])} \\rvert \\le c \\lVert f\\rVert_{L^2([0,1])}$$ for arbitrary $f$ . Letting $f=K_x$ we see that $\\lVert K_x\\rVert_2\\le c$ . The constant on the right-hand side is independent on $x$ , so integrating we get $\\int_{[0, 1]^2} K(x, y)^2\\, dxdy\\le c^2$ and we conclude that, in particular, $K\\in L^2([0, 1]^2)$ . Now consider $T_K(g):=\\int_0^1 K(\\cdot, y)g(y)\\, dy$ , seen as a linear operator of $L^2([0, 1])$ into itself. A consequence of $K\\in L^2([0, 1]^2)$ is that this operator is compact . We infer that the identity operator on $V$ is compact in the $L^2$ topology. By the Riesz lemma we conclude that $V$ is finite-dimensional. $\\Box$ Concluding remarks . The proof of Grothendieck, given in the main question, is superior to this one for two reasons. First, it is more elementary, and second, it gives an explicit bound on the dimension of $V$ in terms of $c$ . The function $K$ is known as a reproducing kernel . A posteriori, given a basis $e_1, \\ldots, e_n$ of $V$ that is $L^2$ -orthonormal, we have that $K(x, y)=\\sum_j e_j(x)e_j(y)$ . The function on the right is exactly the one appearing in Grothendieck's proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"If $V\\subset L^\\infty[0,1]$ with $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\leq c\\|f\\|_2$, then $V$ is finite dimensional\". The question body explains a proof using an explicit calculation with orthonormal vectors and integrating, but the user is looking for a more functional analysis-based argument. They mention that the identity map is a continuous bijection between $(V, \\|\\cdot\\|_2)$ and $(V, \\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty)$, and that equivalence of norms usually holds in finite-dimensional spaces, but they wonder about the converse.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that V is a linear subspace of $L^\\infty[0,1]$, and for all f in V, the infinity norm is bounded by a constant times the L2 norm. Also, since $L^\\infty$ is a subset of $L^2$ here, that might be an implicit assumption, but maybe the key assumptions are the ones given explicitly.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. So:\n\n1. V is a linear subspace of $L^\\infty[0,1].\n2. For every function f in V, the inequality ||f||_∞ ≤ c ||f||_2 holds, where c is a constant.\n\nWait, the problem says \"for all f ∈ V\", so that's a single condition applied to all elements of V. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So maybe splitting into two points: V is a linear subspace, and the norm inequality condition for all f in V. But the norm inequality is a single condition on V, though it applies to all f in V. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption 1: V is a linear subspace of L^∞[0,1].\n\nAssumption 2: For every function f in V, ||f||_∞ ≤ c ||f||_2 for some constant c.\n\nBut the example had two separate lines for different conditions on the same object. Here, since the norm inequality is a condition on the subspace V, maybe that's one assumption. Wait, but in the example, both assumptions were about the same variable n. Here, the first is about V being a subspace, the second is about V having a certain norm inequality. So perhaps they are two separate assumptions.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that V is finite-dimensional.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a linear subspace of $L^\\infty[0,1]$,\nFor every $f \\in V$, $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\leq c \\|f\\|_2$ for some constant $c > 0$.\nProblem:\nProve that $V$ is finite-dimensional.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention the conclusion in their problem statement. Wait, the title is \"If V is a linear subspace... then V is finite dimensional\". So the problem is precisely that: under those assumptions, prove V is finite-dimensional.\n\nSo yes, the problem statement is the title. The rest of the question is the user's attempt and their request for a different proof.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. V is a linear subspace of L^∞[0,1].\n2. There exists a constant c > 0 such that for every f ∈ V, ||f||_∞ ≤ c ||f||_2.\n\nProblem: Prove that V is finite-dimensional.\n\nI think that's correct. The example given in the user's previous structured problem had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, similarly, two assumptions: V is a subspace, and the norm inequality holds. Each assumption is about one property applied to V and its elements. I think this matches the required format.",
