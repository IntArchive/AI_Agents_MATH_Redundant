    "AcceptedAnswer": "Someone on social media (where I linked this post), Prof. Antoine Chambert-Loir , gave a solution. The outline below is from him; errors, if any, are mine. The idea is to set $$a_n = \\operatorname{sl}^2(u_n) \\tag{1}\n$$ where $\\operatorname{sl}$ is the lemniscate sine function . Then the recurrence relation becomes $$\n\\operatorname{sl}^2(u_{n+1}) = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-\\operatorname{sl}^2(u_n)}}{1+\\sqrt{1+\\operatorname{sl}^2(u_n)}} = \\operatorname{sl}^2(\\tfrac{1}{2}u_{n}) \\tag{2}\n$$ using the bisection formulas and identities relating $\\operatorname{sl}$ and $\\operatorname{cl}$ .\nThis shows that $u_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}u_n$ , and therefore $$\nu_n = \\frac{2u_1}{2^{n}} \\tag{3}\n$$ But $a_1=1$ implies $\\operatorname{sl}(u_1) =1$ , which then gives $$\nu_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\Gamma(5/4)}{\\Gamma(3/4)} \\tag{4}\n$$ which finally leads to $$\na_n = \\operatorname{sl}^2(u_n) \\operatorname*{\\sim}_{n\\to\\infty} u_n^2 = \\frac{4u_1^2}{4^n} = \\frac{4\\pi\\Gamma(5/4)^2}{\\Gamma(3/4)^2} \\cdot 4^{-n} \\tag{5}\n$$ where $\\varpi^2=\\frac{4\\pi\\Gamma(5/4)^2}{\\Gamma(3/4)^2}\\approx 6.875185818$ ( $\\varpi$ being the lemniscate constant ). The above, as per the OP's question, corresponds to the initial condition $a_1=1$ . Using the same argument, one easily gets that, for $a_1=\\alpha\\in[0,1]$ , the limiting constant for $4^n a_n$ is given by $$\nC(\\alpha) = 4\\operatorname{arcsl}(\\sqrt{\\alpha})^2 = 4\\left(\\int_0^{\\sqrt{\\alpha}} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x^4}}\\right)^2 \\tag{6}\n$$ where $\\operatorname{arcsl}$ is the lemniscate arcsine function .\nThe behavior of $C(\\alpha)$ as $\\alpha$ ranges from $0$ to $1$ is depicted below.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and identify all the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about finding the limit of 4^n times a_n, where the sequence a_n is defined by a recurrence relation. The recurrence is given as a_{n+1} = (1 - sqrt(1 - a_n)) / (1 + sqrt(1 + a_n)). The user mentions that a_n approaches 0, and the ratio b_n = a_{n+1}/a_n tends to 1/4, suggesting that a_n behaves like 4^{-n}. They also state that under some regular conditions, the limit of 4^n a_n might be a constant C(a_1) depending on the initial term a_1. Specifically, when a_1 = 1, the limit is claimed to be a certain Gamma function expression, which the user finds difficult to prove.\n\nNow, to structure this into the required format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The sequence a_n is defined by the recurrence a_{n+1} = (1 - sqrt(1 - a_n)) / (1 + sqrt(1 + a_n)). That's one assumption about the recurrence relation.\n\n2. The problem mentions that a_n tends to 0. So, another assumption is that a_n converges to 0.\n\n3. The ratio b_n = a_{n+1}/a_n tends to 1/4. This is another condition about the behavior of the sequence.\n\n4. The initial term a_1 is given as 1 in the specific case. However, the problem seems to first state the general case where the limit is C(a_1), and then a specific case when a_1 = 1. So, the specific assumption here is when a_1 = 1.\n\nThe problem statement is to find the limit as n approaches infinity of 4^n a_n, which is given as Gamma(1/4)^4 / (8π) when a_1 = 1. But the user is asking for help in proving this result.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Yet, with a refined insight, some suggest that if a_1=1, we will have [the Gamma limit]... This result is out of my reach. I have no approach to it.\" So the main problem is to prove that limit when a_1=1.\n\nBut in the problem statement part, the user is asking for how to approach proving that specific limit. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include that a_1=1, the recurrence relation, and perhaps the convergence of a_n to 0 and the ratio tending to 1/4. However, the example given in the initial instruction had assumptions listed as separate lines. For instance, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The sequence {a_n} satisfies the recurrence a_{n+1} = (1 - sqrt(1 - a_n)) / (1 + sqrt(1 + a_n)).\n\n- The initial term a_1 is 1.\n\n- a_n approaches 0 as n approaches infinity.\n\n- The ratio b_n = a_{n+1}/a_n approaches 1/4 as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, the user mentions that a_n tends to 0 and b_n tends to 1/4 as given, so these might be given conditions rather than assumptions? Wait, the problem is presented as a question, so the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. The user is stating that it's easy to find that a_n tends to 0 and b_n tends to 1/4, hence a_n is asymptotic to 4^{-n}. Then, under regular conditions, the limit of 4^n a_n exists as C(a_1). But for the specific case a_1=1, the limit is that Gamma expression.\n\nBut the user's question is about proving that specific limit when a_1=1. So the assumptions would include the recurrence relation, a_1=1, and perhaps the convergence of 4^n a_n. But the problem is to find the limit. However, in the example, the assumption included both the general condition (n is an integer) and the specific condition (n divisible by 7). Here, the specific condition is a_1=1.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The sequence {a_n} is defined by the recurrence relation a_{n+1} = (1 - sqrt(1 - a_n)) / (1 + sqrt(1 + a_n)).\n\n- The initial term a_1 is 1.\n\n- a_n converges to 0 as n approaches infinity.\n\n- The ratio b_n = a_{n+1}/a_n approaches 1/4 as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} 4^n a_n = Γ(1/4)^4 / (8π).\n\nBut wait, the user says \"some suggest that if a_1=1, we will have...\" So perhaps the main assumption is a_1=1, and the recurrence. The other conditions (a_n tends to 0, b_n tends to 1/4) might be derived from the recurrence and initial condition. However, in the problem statement, the user mentions these as given. But in the example, assumptions included both the general (n is integer) and specific (n divisible by 7). So here, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence {a_n} satisfies a_{n+1} = (1 - sqrt(1 - a_n)) / (1 + sqrt(1 + a_n)).\n\n- The initial term a_1 = 1.\n\nBecause the other statements (a_n tends to 0, b_n tends to 1/4) are perhaps conclusions from the recurrence and initial term. However, in the original problem, the user presents these as part of the problem's context. But since the task is to structure the problem, perhaps the assumptions should only include what's given as hypotheses, not the derived properties.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove the limit under the given recurrence and a_1=1, then the assumptions are the recurrence and a_1=1. The rest (a_n tends to 0, etc.) might be steps towards the solution, not assumptions.\n\nBut the example given included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So in that case, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under those assumptions. Similarly, here, the problem is to prove the limit under the recurrence and a_1=1. The user already mentions that a_n tends to 0 and b_n tends to 1/4, but perhaps those are observations rather than assumptions. The actual assumptions for the problem are the recurrence and a_1=1. However, the user might be considering that the problem is to prove the limit given that a_n ~ 4^{-n}, but I think the main given conditions are the recurrence and the initial term.\n\nSo, perhaps the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The sequence {a_n} is defined by a_{n+1} = (1 - sqrt(1 - a_n)) / (1 + sqrt(1 + a_n)).\n\n- a_1 = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} 4^n a_n = Γ(1/4)^4 / (8π).\n\nBut then, why in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\"? Because the original problem had to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. The example might have been a modified problem where the user added an assumption. Wait, the original example in the problem had the user write:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might have been a mistake. But perhaps the example was a different scenario. However, the user provided that example as part of the instruction, so I have to follow the format, not the correctness of the example.\n\nBut given that, in the current problem, the user mentions that if a_1=1, then the limit is that Gamma expression. Therefore, the key assumptions are the recurrence relation and a_1=1. The other things (a_n tends to 0, etc.) are perhaps part of the problem's context or steps towards solving it, but not assumptions given by the problem. So I should list the recurrence and a_1=1 as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The sequence {a_n} is defined by a_{n+1} = (1 - sqrt(1 - a_n)) / (1 + sqrt(1 + a_n)).\n\n- a_1 = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} 4^n a_n = Γ(1/4)^4 / (8π).\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that a_n tends to 0 and the ratio tends to 1/4, so maybe those are necessary assumptions. However, if those are conclusions from the recurrence and initial condition, they shouldn't be listed as assumptions. In mathematical problems, assumptions are the given conditions, not the results that need to be proven. So the user in the original problem is saying that it's easy to find that a_n tends to 0 and the ratio tends to 1/4, hence a_n behaves like 4^{-n}, but the actual problem is to find the precise limit of 4^n a_n when a_1=1. Therefore, the only assumptions needed are the recurrence relation and a_1=1. The rest are steps in the solution.\n\nHence, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The sequence {a_n} satisfies a_{n+1} = (1 - sqrt(1 - a_n)) / (1 + sqrt(1 + a_n)).\n\n- The initial term a_1 = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit as n approaches infinity of 4^n a_n equals Γ(1/4)^4 / (8π).\n\nYes, that seems right. The other information (a_n tends to 0, etc.) is part of the problem's context but not assumptions given in the problem. The user is seeking to prove the specific limit under the given recurrence and initial condition. So the assumptions are the recurrence and a_1=1.",
