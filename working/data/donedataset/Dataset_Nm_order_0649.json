    "Content": "A possible proof of Cartan's magic formula $$L_X = i_X \\circ d+d \\circ i_X$$ is to follow the steps: Show that two derivations on $\\Omega^{\\bullet}(M)$ commuting with $d$ are equal iff they agree on $\\Omega^0(M)$. Show that $L_X$ is a derivation on $\\Omega^{\\bullet}(M)$ commuting with $d$. Show that $i_X \\circ d + d \\circ i_X$ is a derivation on $\\Omega^{\\bullet}(M)$ commuting with $d$. Show that $L_X f = Xf = i_Xdf+ d i_Xf$ for all $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)=\\Omega^0(M)$. I followed the sketch of proof, and the only point where I am stuck is when I have to prove that $L_X$ and $d$ commute.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Putting in the limit made it more mysterious. You're just using the fact that for smooth functions mixed partials are equal. That is, $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}.$$ EDIT: In particular, if you write it out in local coordinates, it's computed by taking partial derivatives with the respect to the variables $x^1,\\dots,x^n$. Writing $\\phi_t^*\\omega=\\sum f_I(x,t)dx^I$ (where $I=(i_1,\\dots,i_k)$ ranges over length-$k$ multiindices), then  $d\\phi_t^*\\omega=\\sum \\frac{\\partial f_I(x,t)}{\\partial x^j}\\,dx^j\\wedge dx^I$, etc.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about a proof of Cartan's magic formula, specifically about commuting the exterior derivative d with the limit as t approaches 0. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The proof sketch involves showing that the Lie derivative L_X can be expressed as i_X ◦ d + d ◦ i_X. The key steps are showing that two derivations commuting with d are equal if they agree on 0-forms (smooth functions), and then verifying that both L_X and the operator i_X ◦ d + d ◦ i_X are such derivations. \n\nThe user is stuck on proving that L_X commutes with d. They wrote out the expression for L_X acting on dω and tried to interchange the limit and the exterior derivative. The question is whether you can swap d and the limit. \n\nI recall that in differential geometry, the exterior derivative d is a linear operator on differential forms. Limits in the context of differential forms usually involve pointwise convergence. If the convergence is uniform on compact sets, maybe swapping d and the limit is permissible. But here, the limit is as t approaches 0 of (φ_t^* ω - ω)/t, which is essentially the definition of the Lie derivative L_X ω. \n\nWait, but in the user's expression, they have L_X dω expressed as the derivative at t=0 of φ_t^* dω, which they rewrite as the derivative of d(φ_t^* ω). Then they want to bring the d outside the limit. So the question is: can we interchange d and the limit? \n\nIn calculus, under certain conditions (like uniform convergence), you can interchange limits and derivatives. For differential forms, if the convergence is in a sufficiently smooth topology (like C^1 convergence), then perhaps d and the limit can be swapped. Here, φ_t is the flow of the vector field X, which is smooth assuming X is smooth. Therefore, φ_t^* ω is smooth in t, so differentiating with respect to t and applying d should commute. \n\nAlternatively, since d is a continuous operator in the appropriate topology, it commutes with limits. But I need to confirm this. In the context of differential geometry, the exterior derivative is a continuous linear operator on the space of differential forms with the C^1 topology. Therefore, it should commute with limits in this topology. Since the flow φ_t is smooth, the pullback φ_t^* ω depends smoothly on t, so the limit as t→0 of (φ_t^* ω - ω)/t is the Lie derivative L_X ω, and applying d to this limit would be the same as the limit of d applied to (φ_t^* ω - ω)/t. \n\nBut wait, the user's expression has d acting on (1/t)(φ_t^* ω - ω), inside the limit. So they have d of [ (φ_t^* ω - ω)/t ] inside the limit as t→0. If we can swap d and the limit, then this would be equal to the limit of d applied to that expression, which is exactly d(L_X ω). However, the user's computation starts with L_X dω and arrives at the expression with d and the limit swapped. \n\nWait, actually, let's parse the equations again:\n\nThe user wrote:\nL_X dω = d/dt|_{t=0} φ_t^* dω = d/dt|_{t=0} d φ_t^* ω = lim_{t→0} d [ (1/t)(φ_t^* ω - ω) ]\n\nBut they are asking whether they can permute d and the limit. That is, can they say that lim_{t→0} d [ (φ_t^* ω - ω)/t ] = d [ lim_{t→0} (φ_t^* ω - ω)/t ] ?\n\nIf yes, then this would be d(L_X ω), which would mean L_X dω = d(L_X ω), implying that L_X commutes with d. But wait, we need to show that L_X commutes with d, i.e., L_X d = d L_X. So if we can swap d and the limit, then indeed L_X dω = d L_X ω, which shows [L_X, d] = 0.\n\nTherefore, the crux is justifying the interchange of d and the limit. The reason this is permissible is because the pullback φ_t^* is smooth in t, so the difference quotient (φ_t^* ω - ω)/t converges to L_X ω in the C^1 topology (since the derivative in t is the Lie derivative), and thus applying d, which is a continuous operator in this topology, commutes with the limit.\n\nAlternatively, since d is a linear operator and the limit is a linear operation, in finite-dimensional spaces (which manifolds are, locally), exchanging linear operations is allowed. However, I need to be precise here. The key point is that the pullback operation φ_t^* commutes with d because pullback and exterior derivative commute in general. Then, when taking the derivative with respect to t, since d is linear, it can be interchanged with the derivative in t. \n\nWait, another angle: The pullback φ_t^* commutes with d, so φ_t^* dω = d φ_t^* ω. Then, when taking the derivative d/dt at t=0 of both sides, we have L_X dω = d/dt|_{t=0} d φ_t^* ω = d (d/dt|_{t=0} φ_t^* ω) = d L_X ω. Hence, L_X dω = d L_X ω, so L_X commutes with d. \n\nAh, here's the key point: because φ_t^* commutes with d, and differentiation with respect to t (the derivative in t) is applied to both sides. Since d is linear, the derivative in t can be pulled inside the d. So we don't need to interchange limit and d, but instead use that d commutes with the derivative in t. \n\nSo perhaps the user's confusion comes from representing the derivative as a limit and then trying to interchange the limit and d. But actually, since d is linear and continuous, the derivative (which is a limit) can be interchanged with d. \n\nIn summary, the justification is that the exterior derivative d is a continuous linear operator on the space of differential forms, and therefore commutes with taking derivatives (limits) with respect to the parameter t. Hence, swapping d and the limit is valid here.",
