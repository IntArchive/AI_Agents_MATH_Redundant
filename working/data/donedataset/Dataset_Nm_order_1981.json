    "AcceptedAnswer": "Without measure theory: Lemma: Suppose $0<a<b$ and $0\\le h\\le a.$ Then $$\\sqrt {b} - \\sqrt {a}\\le \\sqrt {b-h}-\\sqrt {a-h}.$$ On the right, both $a,b$ have been shifted to the left by $h.$ A glance at the graph of $y=x^{1/2}$ makes the result intuitively clear: The rate of growth of $\\sqrt {x}$ is larger as $x$ gets smaller. To prove the lemma, define $f(h)$ to be the right side minus the left side. Then $f$ is continuous on $[0,a],$ differentiable on $(0,a],$ and $f(0)=0.$ Verify $f' > 0$ on $(0,a]$ to then give the result. Suppose now that $[a_1,b_1] < [a_2,b_2] < \\cdots < [a_n,b_n]$ are pairwise disjoint. Claim: $$\\tag 1 \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (\\sqrt {b_k}-\\sqrt {a_k}) < \\sqrt {\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (b_k - a_k)}.$$ Proof: By the lemma, the sum on the left can only increase if we shift all of the $[a_k,b_k]$ to the left so they're right next to each other. We then obtain intervals $[c_{k-1},c_k],$ with $0=c_0 < c_1 < \\cdots <c_n,$ and lengths $c_k-c_{k-1} =b_k-a_k.$ Thus $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (\\sqrt {b_k} - \\sqrt {a_k}) \\le \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (\\sqrt {c_k} - \\sqrt {c_{k-1}}) = \\sqrt {c_n}.$$ But $c_n$ is just the sum of the lengths of these intervals, so we have $(1).$ Now it's easy to find a $\\delta$ for a given $\\epsilon$ in proving absolute continuity of $\\sqrt x:$ Just choose $\\delta = \\epsilon^2.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the function f(x) = √x is absolutely continuous on some interval, probably [0, ∞) or a closed interval like [0, M]. The definition of absolute continuity given here is the standard one: for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that for any finite collection of disjoint intervals [a_k, b_k] with the total length less than δ, the sum of the differences in function values is less than ε.\n\nThe user mentioned they tried to find a δ independent of n but couldn't. Their mistake might be in how they're approaching the estimation of the sum ∑(√b_k - √a_k). Let's recall that absolute continuity often involves using properties like the function being Lipschitz (which √x is not on [0, M] because the derivative becomes unbounded near 0) or using integral estimates.\n\nSince √x is differentiable almost everywhere with derivative 1/(2√x), and since the integral of the derivative over [0, M] is finite (∫₀ᴹ 1/(2√x) dx = √M), perhaps they should use the fundamental theorem of calculus. Absolute continuity can be shown by verifying that the function is an integral of its derivative, which would require the derivative to be integrable. But maybe the user is approaching it directly from the definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they tried to use the mean value theorem on each interval [a_k, b_k], so √b_k - √a_k = (1/(2√c_k))(b_k - a_k) for some c_k in (a_k, b_k). Then the sum becomes ∑ (b_k - a_k)/(2√c_k). If they tried to bound each term by (1/(2√c_k))δ, but since c_k can be very small (close to 0), 1/√c_k can be very large, making their δ dependent on n. That would be the mistake: not accounting for the intervals near zero where the derivative is large.\n\nThe correct approach might be to split the intervals into those near 0 and those away from 0. For intervals away from 0, say c_k ≥ δ', the derivative is bounded by 1/(2√δ'), so the sum over those intervals would be ≤ (1/(2√δ')) * total length. For intervals near 0, the total variation can be controlled because the integral of 1/(2√x) from 0 to δ'' is √δ''. So by choosing δ'' small enough, the integral (and hence the sum over intervals near 0) can be made less than ε/2, and then choose δ' accordingly for the other intervals. Then combine the two parts. This way, δ is chosen based on ε without depending on n.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking for the assumptions. Let me check the original question again. The problem is to prove √x is absolutely continuous. The user's question mentions they tried to get δ independent of n but failed. The key assumptions here would relate to the properties needed for absolute continuity. However, since the problem is to prove the statement, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The original problem states f(x) = √x, and the user is to show absolute continuity. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list the conditions given. But in the example provided earlier, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake, but the user wants us to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the original problem. Wait, no. Wait the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption in the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\". But why is there another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\"? That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was wrong. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so there's no assumption that n is divisible by 7. The example's formatted problem seems to have an error. Therefore, maybe the user intended that when formatting, we need to extract any implicit assumptions. But in the original problem, the user might have made a mistake. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a typo, but in the example, they added an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the example is wrong, and the user wants us to proceed correctly.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about proving sqrt(x) is absolutely continuous. The original problem's assumptions would be the function is sqrt(x), and the intervals are disjoint, and the sum of their lengths is less than delta. So when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions. From the problem statement:\n\nThe user wants to prove f(x) = sqrt(x) is absolutely continuous. The definition requires for every epsilon >0, there exists delta>0 such that for any finite collection of disjoint intervals [a_k, b_k] with sum (b_k -a_k) < delta, then sum (sqrt(b_k) - sqrt(a_k)) < epsilon.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = sqrt(x)\n\n- epsilon > 0 is given\n\n- {[a_k, b_k]} is a finite collection of disjoint intervals\n\n- sum_{k=1}^n (b_k - a_k) < delta\n\nBut according to the example, the assumption section lists the conditions of the problem. The problem is to prove that sqrt(x) is absolutely continuous, which by definition means satisfying that for every epsilon, there exists delta such that whenever you have such intervals with total length < delta, the sum of function differences is < epsilon. But how to structure this as assumptions?\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. That seems like a mistake, but maybe the example had a different original problem. Perhaps the original example problem had a hidden assumption. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nBut ignoring that, in the current problem, the assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem. The problem is to prove sqrt(x) is absolutely continuous. The definition of absolute continuity requires the condition on epsilon and delta. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = sqrt(x)\n\n- epsilon > 0 is arbitrary\n\n- {[a_k, b_k]} are disjoint intervals\n\nBut the user's question includes their attempt: they tried to get delta independent of n but couldn't. Their problem is that their delta depends on n. So the mistake is that they need to find a delta that works for any n, which is required by the definition. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the necessary conditions from the problem statement.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = √x\n\n- For every ε > 0\n\n- There exists δ > 0\n\n- For any finite collection of disjoint intervals [a_k, b_k]\n\n- Such that ∑(b_k - a_k) < δ\n\nThen the problem is to prove that ∑(√b_k - √a_k) < ε.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables in the problem. For the current problem, the function is given, and the conditions on the intervals. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\n- f(x) = √x\n\n- {[a_k, b_k]} is a finite collection of disjoint intervals\n\n- ∑_{k=1}^n (b_k - a_k) < δ\n\nBut the problem is to show that for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that the sum of the function differences is < ε. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem, which include the function and the properties of the intervals.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f(x) = √x,\n\n- ε > 0 is given,\n\n- {[a_k, b_k]}_{k=1}^n is a finite collection of disjoint intervals,\n\n- ∑_{k=1}^n (b_k - a_k) < δ.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∑_{k=1}^n (√b_k - √a_k) < ε.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is defined as f(x) = √x,\n\n- ε is a positive real number,\n\n- The collection of intervals {[a_k, b_k]}_{k=1}^n is finite and disjoint,\n\n- The sum of the lengths of the intervals ∑_{k=1}^n (b_k - a_k) is less than δ.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∑_{k=1}^n (√b_k - √a_k) < ε.\n\nBut the original problem statement in the user's question is to prove that sqrt(x) is absolutely continuous, which by definition is exactly what's stated here. So the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nHowever, in the example, the assumptions included conditions on n (integer and divisible by 7), but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So maybe the example was incorrect. For the current problem, the key is to list the assumptions given in the problem statement. Since the problem is to prove absolute continuity, the assumptions are the components of the definition: the function is sqrt(x), epsilon is given, the intervals are disjoint and their total length is less than delta. Then the problem is to show the sum of the function differences is less than epsilon.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f(x) = √x,\n\n- ε > 0,\n\n- {[a_k, b_k]} are disjoint intervals,\n\n- ∑ (b_k - a_k) < δ.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∑ (√b_k - √a_k) < ε.\n\nBut to match the example's style, each assumption should be a single line addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is defined by f(x) = √x,\n\n- ε is a positive real number,\n\n- The intervals [a_k, b_k] are pairwise disjoint,\n\n- The sum of the lengths of the intervals ∑_{k=1}^n (b_k - a_k) is less than δ.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∑_{k=1}^n (√b_k - √a_k) < ε.\n\nThis captures all the necessary conditions. The function definition, the given epsilon, the disjointness of the intervals, and the total length being less than delta. The problem is to show the sum of the square roots' differences is less than epsilon.",
