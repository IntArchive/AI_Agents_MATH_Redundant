    "Content": "Here is a question that naturally arose in the study of some specific integrals. I'm curious if for such integrals are known nice real analysis tools for calculating them ( including here all possible sources in literature that are publicaly available ).  At some point I'll add my real analysis solution. It's a question for the informative purpose rather than finding solutions, the solution is optional. Prove that $$\\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{1}{\\pi^2+(2 \\operatorname{arctanh}(x))^2} \\, dx=\\frac{1}{6}. $$ Here is a supplementary question $$\\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{\\log(1-x)}{\\pi^2+(2 \\operatorname{arctanh}(x))^2} \\, dx=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{\\gamma }{6}+\\frac{\\log (2)}{6}-2 \\log (A) $$ where $A$ is Glaisher–Kinkelin constant . for the passionates of integrals, series and limits.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this integral problem. The user wants me to structure the problem by listing assumptions and then stating the problem clearly. The original question is about proving that the integral from -1 to 1 of 1 over (π² plus (2 arctanh(x)) squared) dx equals 1/6. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, I should look for any conditions or properties that are given or implied in the problem. \n\nLooking at the integral, the limits are from -1 to 1. The integrand involves arctanh(x), which is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function. The domain of arctanh(x) is (-1, 1), so the integral is over the entire domain where arctanh is defined. But since the integral is from -1 to 1, and the function is likely defined there except at the endpoints where it goes to infinity. However, the integral seems to converge because as x approaches ±1, arctanh(x) approaches ±infinity, but the denominator becomes π² plus a large term squared, so the integrand behaves like 1/(large term squared), which is integrable.\n\nSo possible assumptions might include the interval of integration, the definition of arctanh(x), and perhaps the integrability of the function over the interval. However, the problem doesn't state any explicit conditions beyond the integral itself. The function is being integrated over [-1,1], and arctanh(x) is defined there. The problem is to prove the integral equals 1/6. \n\nWait, but arctanh(x) is real and defined for x in (-1,1), but at x=1 and x=-1, it's undefined. However, the integral is from -1 to 1, so maybe the assumption is that it's an improper integral, approaching the limits as x approaches ±1. But the original problem statement doesn't mention this; it just writes the integral as from -1 to 1. So perhaps an implicit assumption is that the integral is an improper integral. Maybe that's worth noting. Also, the integrand is continuous on (-1,1) but has singularities at the endpoints. So the integral is improper at both endpoints.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user just wrote the integral from -1 to 1. So perhaps the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [-1, 1].\n- The integral is an improper integral, evaluated as the limit as a approaches 1 from below and b approaches -1 from above.\n- The function arctanh(x) is defined for x in (-1, 1).\n\nBut wait, the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention the integral being improper, but since the integrand isn't defined at ±1, it's necessarily an improper integral. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is improper, with limits approaching -1 and 1 from within the interval (-1, 1).\n- The function 1/(π² + (2 arctanh(x))²) is integrable over [-1, 1].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the integral converges, so the user just wants the proof of its value being 1/6. But since the example given in the problem had specific assumptions about the variables, here the assumptions might not need to mention the integral being improper unless it's a crucial part of the problem. Maybe the key assumptions here are about the interval and the function's definition.\n\nWait, the example given for the A(n) problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the integral doesn't have any parameters like n; it's a definite integral. So perhaps the only assumption here is that the integral is over the interval [-1, 1], and that arctanh(x) is the standard inverse hyperbolic tangent function. But maybe the problem assumes knowledge that arctanh(x) = (1/2) ln((1+x)/(1-x)), which is true. So perhaps that's an important property here.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state any conditions on x; it's just given as an integral. So maybe the assumptions are minimal here. The example included assumptions that were in the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original example's formatted problem's assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n+2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps there was a miscommunication. Because in the original problem, it's to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would make the problem weaker. Maybe that was a mistake in the example. So perhaps the user wants to extract assumptions that are implicit in the problem, but in the case of the integral, the assumptions would be things like the integral is over [-1,1], the function is integrable, and perhaps that arctanh is defined as the standard inverse hyperbolic tangent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was a different problem where the original problem had an error, and the formatted problem corrected it by adding the divisibility by 7. But that's unclear. Given that, perhaps for the integral problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is evaluated over the interval x ∈ [-1, 1].\n- The function arctanh(x) is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, defined as (1/2) ln((1+x)/(1-x)).\n\nBut in the original problem, the user didn't state any conditions, so maybe the only assumption is that the integral is taken over [-1,1], and the rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumption is that the integral converges, but that's part of what needs to be proven. Wait, no, the problem is to compute the integral and show it's 1/6, so the convergence is part of the proof. Hence, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's limits and the definition of arctanh(x). However, perhaps the substitution variable or domain considerations are part of the assumptions. \n\nGiven the example seemed to include both the variable's type (integer) and an additional condition (divisible by 7), which might have been part of the problem's hidden assumptions, perhaps in the integral problem, the key assumptions are the interval and the definition of arctanh. But to follow the example, maybe list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [-1, 1].\nThe function arctanh(x) is defined as the inverse hyperbolic tangent function.\n\nBut perhaps each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from x = -1 to x = 1.\narctanh(x) is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function.\nThe integral is an improper integral due to the singularities at x = ±1.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention the integral being improper; it's just written as ∫_{-1}^1. So maybe that's an implicit assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes the reader knows that arctanh has singularities at ±1, hence the integral is improper.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions line by line, each for one object or condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is real.\nThe integral is computed over the interval x ∈ [-1, 1].\narctanh(x) is defined as (1/2) ln((1 + x)/(1 - x)).\nThe integral is treated as an improper integral at the endpoints x = -1 and x = 1.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention treating it as improper; it's just part of the integral's nature. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫_{-1}^1 [1/(π² + (2 arctanh(x))²] dx is considered.\narctanh(x) is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function.\n\nBut maybe the assistant needs to list all necessary conditions for the problem to hold. Since the integral evaluates to 1/6, perhaps there are no additional hidden conditions; the integral is as stated. Therefore, the main assumption is the interval and the function's definition.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the integral's setup. The example had assumptions that perhaps were inferred from the problem's context. Maybe in this case, the only assumption is the integral's bounds and the definition of arctanh(x).\n\nConsidering the example, where the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems contradictory. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But assuming that the user wants to extract implicit assumptions, maybe in the integral problem, the assumptions are the integral's interval and the function's definition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval x ∈ [-1, 1].\narctanh(x) denotes the inverse hyperbolic tangent function.\n\nThat's two assumptions, each addressing one property. Now the problem statement is to prove the integral equals 1/6. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe integral is taken over the interval x ∈ [-1, 1],\narctanh(x) denotes the inverse hyperbolic tangent function.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{1}{\\pi^2 + (2 \\operatorname{arctanh}(x))^2} \\, dx = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem also mentions a supplementary question about another integral involving log(1 - x), but the user says \"Your task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the main problem is the first integral, and the supplementary is extra. Therefore, the formatted problem should only include the first integral.\n\nSo, final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe integral is evaluated over the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$,\n$\\operatorname{arctanh}(x)$ is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{-1}^1 \\frac{1}{\\pi^2 + (2 \\operatorname{arctanh}(x))^2} \\, dx = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\n###",
