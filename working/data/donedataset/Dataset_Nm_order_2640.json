    "Content": "Prove that the following function is Riemann-integrable on $[0, 1]$ even though it has infinite many discontinuities on $[0, 1]$ : $$f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } x = \\frac1n \\text{ where } n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases}$$ I have a possible proof but don't feel too confident about it. If anyone could tell me if its valid or give me another proof, or hints to another proof, that would be very helpful! Let $\\varepsilon > 0$ .  Observe that given $\\frac\\varepsilon2$ there exists a least natural number $N$ with $\\frac{1}{N+1} < \\frac\\varepsilon2$ . Observe that there are $N$ numbers less than $N + 1$ . Now we want to consider the two intervals $[0, \\delta]$ and $[\\delta, 1]$ with $0 < \\delta < 1$ and $\\delta = \\frac\\varepsilon2$ . Lets first consider the interval $[\\delta, 1]$ . Observe that there are exactly $N$ discontinuities on this interval, that is, $N$ elements of the form $\\frac1n$ such that $\\frac1N > \\frac{1}{N+1}$ . This interval is bounded since by construction $f$ is bounded above by 1 and bounded below by 0 and thus it is bounded. We have satisfied the hypothesis of Exercise 6.6 and thus we can conclude that $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[\\delta, 1]$ . Moreover, since $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[\\delta, 1]$ , by Theorem 6.1, we are assured that there exists a partition $P_2$ such that $U(P_2, f) - L(P_2, f) < \\frac\\varepsilon2$ . Observe that the lower sum is 0 for any given partition, so we have $U(P_2, f) < \\frac\\varepsilon2$ . Now let us consider the interval $[0, \\delta]$ . Let $P_1$ be any partition of this set and observe that $$U(P, f) = \\sum_{i = 1}^l M_i \\, \\Delta x_i < 1 \\cdot \\big( \\frac\\varepsilon2 - 0\\big) = \\frac\\varepsilon2$$ since the supremum of the entire interval is 1, it must hold that 1 is an upper bound for any smaller interval. Moreover the length of the interval $[0, \\delta]$ is $\\delta$ which is defined to be $\\frac\\varepsilon2$ . Again it still holds that the lower sum is 0. Thus we have $U(P_1, f) < \\frac\\varepsilon2$ . Now choose $P = P_1 \\cup P_2$ to be a common refinement of $P_1$ and $P_2$ and observe that $$U(P, f) - L(P, f) = U(P, f) = U(P_1, f) + U(P_2, f) = \\frac\\varepsilon2 + \\frac\\varepsilon2 = \\varepsilon$$ Thus by Theorem 6.1 $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[0, 1]$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As mentioned in Michael Greinecker's comment, a nice way to go is to use the following result: Theorem: Let $f: [a,b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a bounded function.  If for all $c \\in (a,b)$ the restriction of $f$ to $[c,b]$ is Riemann integrable, then $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ and $\\int_a^b f = \\lim_{c \\rightarrow a^+} \\int_c^b f$ . This result is proved in $\\S 8.3.2$ of my honors calculus notes .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original problem is about proving that a function with infinitely many discontinuities is Riemann-integrable on [0,1]. The function is defined as 1 at points 1/n for natural numbers n and 0 otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example given in the problem statement mentions listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Looking at the problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The function f is defined on the interval [0,1].\n2. f(x) = 1 at points x = 1/n where n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n3. f(x) = 0 otherwise.\n4. The set of discontinuities of f on [0,1] is infinite.\n\nEach of these points is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove that f is Riemann-integrable on [0,1] despite having infinitely many discontinuities.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But here, the problem states that the function has infinitely many discontinuities. So the assumptions should include the definition of the function and the nature of its discontinuities.\n\nLet me check the original question again. The user wrote: \"Prove that the following function is Riemann-integrable on [0, 1] even though it has infinitely many discontinuities on [0, 1].\" Then defines f(x) as 1 at 1/n and 0 otherwise. So the main assumptions are the definition of f and the fact that it has infinitely many discontinuities. Each of these should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: The function f is defined on the interval [0,1].\n\nAssumption 2: For each x in [0,1], f(x) = 1 if x = 1/n for some positive integer n.\n\nAssumption 3: For all other x in [0,1], f(x) = 0.\n\nAssumption 4: The set of discontinuities of f on [0,1] is infinite.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"it has infinitely many discontinuities,\" so maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, in the example given, the original problem had \"Prove that... is divisible by 91\" and the formatted problem listed the assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So in that case, the divisibility by 7 was an assumption, but in the original problem, it's part of the problem statement. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the user in the example made a mistake? Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems inconsistent. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake in the example. However, perhaps the example is illustrative of how to extract assumptions even if the original problem doesn't state them explicitly. Maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated info and list the necessary assumptions. However, in the given problem about Riemann integrability, the user needs to list the assumptions given in the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the function is defined with specific cases, and it's given that it has infinitely many discontinuities. So those are the assumptions. So the assumptions are:\n\n- f is defined on [0,1].\n- f(x) = 1 if x = 1/n for some n ∈ ℕ.\n- f(x) = 0 otherwise.\n- f has infinitely many discontinuities on [0,1].\n\nBut perhaps the last point is redundant because the definition of f already implies the discontinuities. Wait, the problem states \"even though it has infinitely many discontinuities,\" which is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So maybe the assumptions are just the definition of f. Let's see.\n\nThe problem is to prove integrability given that the function is defined in this way, which inherently has infinite discontinuities. So the assumptions would be the definition of the function, which includes the points of discontinuity. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is defined on the interval [0,1].\n2. For x = 1/n where n is a positive integer, f(x) = 1.\n3. For all other x in [0,1], f(x) = 0.\n\nThe fact that there are infinitely many discontinuities is a consequence of the definition, so maybe it's part of the problem statement. However, the problem explicitly mentions \"even though it has infinitely many discontinuities,\" so perhaps that is a given condition, hence an assumption. But since the function's definition already creates discontinuities at each 1/n, except possibly at 0, but 0 is a limit point. However, f is continuous at 0 because near 0, all points are 0 except the 1/n which approach 0, but the function's value at 0 is 0, but wait, f(0) is defined as 0, since x=0 is not of the form 1/n for any positive integer n. So actually, at x=0, f(x)=0. The points of discontinuity are at x=1, 1/2, 1/3, etc., which are countably infinite. Therefore, the function indeed has infinitely many discontinuities, so that's a given condition. But the problem states that explicitly as part of the problem. So perhaps the assumptions include:\n\n- The function f has infinitely many discontinuities on [0,1].\n\nBut since the definition of f already implies that, maybe it's redundant. However, to follow the example, which included both the definition and the divisibility condition, perhaps here we need to list the function's definition and the fact of infinite discontinuities as separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to take the given definition of f and the fact that it has infinitely many discontinuities as given. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f: [0,1] → ℝ is defined as 1 at x = 1/n for n ∈ ℕ, and 0 otherwise.\n2. f has infinitely many discontinuities on [0,1].\n\nBut since the second is a consequence of the first, but the problem states it explicitly. To adhere to the user's example, which included redundant assumptions (like n divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem but was added in the formatted version), perhaps here we need to list the components of the function's definition as separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption 1: The domain of f is the interval [0,1].\n\nAssumption 2: For each x in [0,1], f(x) = 1 if x = 1/n for some positive integer n.\n\nAssumption 3: For all other x in [0,1], f(x) = 0.\n\nAssumption 4: The set of discontinuities of f on [0,1] is infinite.\n\nBut maybe the fourth assumption is part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, the problem says \"even though it has infinitely many discontinuities,\" which is part of what needs to be proven. No, actually, the problem states that it has infinitely many discontinuities, so that is a given condition. So the problem is to prove integrability given that the function has this definition and has infinitely many discontinuities.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the definition of f and the fact of infinite discontinuities as assumptions. However, perhaps the discontinuities are implied by the definition, so maybe it's redundant. The example given by the user included an assumption that wasn't explicitly stated in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems to be incorrect. That suggests that maybe the example is flawed, but the user wants to follow that structure regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is defined on [0,1].\n2. f(x) = 1 at x = 1/n for each positive integer n.\n3. f(x) = 0 otherwise.\n4. The set of discontinuities of f on [0,1] is infinite.\n\nBut since 4 is a consequence of 2 and 3, but the problem mentions it explicitly, so perhaps it's included.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says \"even though it has infinitely many discontinuities,\" which is part of the problem's premise. So it's an assumption that the function has infinitely many discontinuities. Therefore, the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The function f is defined on [0,1].\n- For each x in [0,1], f(x) = 1 if x = 1/n for some positive integer n.\n- For all other x in [0,1], f(x) = 0.\n- The function f has infinitely many discontinuities on [0,1].\n\nBut again, the last point is redundant given the definition. However, to match the example where redundant assumptions were added, perhaps we should list each condition separately.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; it said for every integer n. So that example seems incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user's example is not a good model. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to extract implicit assumptions. In any case, for the current problem, the key assumptions are the definition of f. The fact that it has infinitely many discontinuities is part of the problem statement but is a consequence of the definition. So perhaps the assumptions are just the definition of the function.\n\nThus, the correct formatted problem should have assumptions:\n\n- The function f is defined on [0,1].\n- For x = 1/n where n is a positive integer, f(x) = 1.\n- For all other x in [0,1], f(x) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is Riemann-integrable on [0,1] even though it has infinitely many discontinuities.\n\nBut the original problem statement includes \"even though it has infinitely many discontinuities,\" so that is part of the problem to be proven. Wait, no—the problem is to prove integrability given that it has infinitely many discontinuities. So the problem statement is: given this function (which has infinitely many discontinuities), prove it's integrable.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the definition of f, and the problem is to prove integrability despite the infinite discontinuities.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined on [0, 1],\nFor each x in [0,1], f(x) = 1 if x = 1/n for some positive integer n,\nFor all other x in [0,1], f(x) = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is Riemann-integrable on [0, 1].\n\nAlternatively, include the infinite discontinuities as an assumption:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined on [0,1],\nf(x) = 1 if x = 1/n for some positive integer n,\nf(x) = 0 otherwise,\nf has infinitely many discontinuities on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is Riemann-integrable on [0,1].\n\nBut since the problem mentions the infinite discontinuities explicitly, maybe it's part of the problem statement. However, in the example, the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption even though the original problem didn't state that. So perhaps the assistant is supposed to extract all conditions from the problem, whether explicit or implicit.\n\nIn this case, the function's definition leads to infinite discontinuities, which is part of the problem's premise. So the problem is to show integrability given that the function is defined as such (which inherently has infinite discontinuities). Therefore, the formatted problem should list the function's definition as assumptions and the problem as proving integrability.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f is defined on the interval [0, 1],\nFor each x in [0,1], f(x) = 1 if x = 1/n for some positive integer n,\nFor all other x in [0,1], f(x) = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is Riemann-integrable on [0, 1].\n\nAlternatively, if the problem mentions the infinite discontinuities as a condition, perhaps include it as an assumption. But since the problem says \"even though it has infinitely many discontinuities,\" it's part of the problem's challenge, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are just the function's definition.\n\nBut to adhere to the example where the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" which seems incorrect, perhaps the current problem should list the function's definition points and the domain. But following the example's structure, the original example's assumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n,\" so the formatted problem added an incorrect assumption. This suggests that perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we should follow their format. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions should include:\n\n- The function f has infinitely many discontinuities on [0,1].\n\nBut that is a property of f, so it's part of the problem's conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined on [0,1],\nf(x) = 1 at x = 1/n for positive integers n,\nf(x) = 0 otherwise,\nf has infinitely many discontinuities on [0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is Riemann-integrable on [0,1].\n\nBut since the infinite discontinuities are a consequence of f's definition, perhaps it's redundant. However, to make it explicit, as per the problem statement mentioning it, it's better to include it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as follows: the user is given that the function has infinitely many discontinuities and is defined in a certain way, and needs to prove integrability. Therefore, the assumptions are the definition of the function and the fact of infinite discontinuities.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should list each part of the function's definition as separate assumptions, and the problem is to prove integrability.",
