    "Content": "In this context composition series means the same thing as defined here. As the title says given a finite group $G$ and $H \\unlhd G$ I would like to show there is a composition series containing $H.$ Following is my attempt at it. The main argument of the claim is showing the following. Lemma. If $H \\unlhd G$ and $G/H$ is not simple then there exist a subgroup $I$ such that $H \\unlhd I \\unlhd G.$ The proof follows from the 4th isomorphism theorem since if $G/H$ is not simple then there is a normal subgroup $\\overline{I} \\unlhd G/H$ of the form $\\overline{I} = H/I.$ Suppose now that $G/H$ is not simple. Using the above lemma we deduce that there exist a finite chain of groups (since $G$ is finite) such that $$H \\unlhd I_1 \\unlhd \\cdots \\unlhd I_k \\unlhd G$$ and $G/I_k$ is simple. Now one has to repeat this process for all other pairs $I_{i+1}/I_{i}$ and for $I_1/H$ until the quotients are simple groups. This is all fine since all the subgroups are finite as well. Now if $H$ is simple we are done otherwise there is a group $J \\unlhd H$ and we inductively construct the composition for $H.$ Is the above \"proof\" correct? If so, is there a way to make it less messy?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your approach has all the elements of a proof, but I wanted to offer suggestions for a \"less messy\" version. First of all, as long as you are using that \"any finite group has a composition series\", you shouldn't need your lemma. You could go about it this way. Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ . Then $H$ has a composition series $1=H_0<\\dots<H_k=H$ . The group $G/H$ also has a composition series, which we will enumerate this way: $$\nH/H=H_{k}/H<\\dots <H_n/H=G/H\n$$ By an isomorphism theorem, the fact that $(H_{j}/H)/(H_{j-1}/H)$ is simple is equivalent to $H_j/H_{j-1}$ being simple. Putting these two chains together, you have that $H_0<\\dots <H_n$ is a composition series for $G$ through $H$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified structure. The structure has two parts: Assumptions and Problem. The example they provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line. The problem is then stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question: The title is \"Every normal subgroup of a finite group is contained in some composition series\". The user is asking if their proof is correct and if it can be made less messy. But the task is to structure the problem as per the format, not to answer the question. So I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nFirst, the original problem statement is: Given a finite group G and H a normal subgroup of G, show there is a composition series containing H. The user's attempt involves using the lemma about constructing a chain of normal subgroups and then refining it.\n\nNow, to structure this. The assumptions should list all conditions. The group G is finite. H is a normal subgroup of G. Then, the problem is to prove that there exists a composition series of G that includes H.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"every normal subgroup of a finite group is contained in some composition series\". So the key assumptions are that G is finite, H is a normal subgroup of G. Those are two separate assumptions. So in the Assumption section, each line is one condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nH is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a composition series of G containing H.\n\nThe user's own question is about verifying their proof, but the actual problem to structure is the one in the title and the initial statement. The rest of the text is their attempt and their question about correctness, which might not be part of the structured problem. So we need to filter out the actual problem from the user's attempt.\n\nSo the main problem is: Given a finite group G and a normal subgroup H of G, prove that H is contained in some composition series of G.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the two assumptions (G finite, H normal in G) and the problem statement as proving the existence of such a composition series.",
