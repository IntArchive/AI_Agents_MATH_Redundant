    "Content": "Let $(G,.)$ be a group and $m,n \\in\\mathbb Z$ such that $\\gcd(m,n)=1$. Assume that\n$$ \\forall a,b \\in G, \\,a^mb^m=b^ma^m,$$\n$$\\forall a,b \\in G, \\, a^nb^n=b^na^n.$$ Then how prove $G$ is an abelian group? Some context : Some of these commutation relations often imply that $G$ is abelian, for example if $(ab)^i = a^i b^i$ for three consecutive integers $i$ then $G$ is abelian , or if $g^2 = e$ for all $g$ then $G$ is abelian . This looks like another example of this phenomenon, but the same techniques do not apply.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $M \\subset G$ be the subgroup generated by all $m$-th powers and let $N \\subset G$ be the subgroup generated by all $n$-th powers. These subgroups are clearly abelian normal subgroups. Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, $G = MN$, and hence $M \\cap N$ is contained in the center $Z(G)$ of $G$. \nTo prove that $G$ is abelian it suffices to show that $M$ and $N$ commute, that is $[M,N]=1$. Note that $[M,N] \\subset M \\cap N$ (since $M$ and $N$ are normal subgroups). Let $a \\in M$ and $b \\in N$.\nThen $[a, b] = a^{−1}b^{−1}ab \\in M \\cap N$. Hence $[a, b] = z$ with $z \\in Z(G)$. Hence $b^{−1}ab = za$, whence $b^{−1}a^nb=z^na^n$. Since $a^n \\in N$ it commutes with $b$, so $z^n=1$. Similarly $z^m=1$. Since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, we conclude $z=1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a group G is abelian given certain commutation conditions with coprime exponents m and n. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that G is a group, m and n are integers with gcd(m,n)=1. Then, for all a, b in G, a^m b^m equals b^m a^m, and similarly, a^n b^n equals b^n a^n. The goal is to prove G is abelian.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a group. (This is given since the problem mentions \"(G,.) be a group\".)\n2. m and n are integers. (Stated as \"m,n ∈ Z\".)\n3. gcd(m, n) = 1. (Coprimality condition.)\n4. For all a, b in G, a^m b^m = b^m a^m. (First commutation relation.)\n5. For all a, b in G, a^n b^n = b^n a^n. (Second commutation relation.)\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. The problem is to prove G is abelian. I need to make sure that each assumption is only one condition per line. Let me check if I missed anything. The context part mentions other scenarios where commutation implies abelian, but those are just context and not part of the problem's assumptions. So I should ignore that part. The title also repeats the problem statement. So the structured part should include all the key assumptions without the context. \n\nWait, does the problem mention anything about m and n being positive? The original says m,n are integers, but in group theory, exponents can be negative, which would mean inverses. However, since the problem just states integers, maybe that's all. So the assumptions are as I listed before. \n\nYes, that should cover all the necessary parts. Let me put it all together now.",
