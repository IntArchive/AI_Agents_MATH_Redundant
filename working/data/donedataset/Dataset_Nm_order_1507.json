Sounds funny, especially when you understand german (sorry Gustav ;-), but how does it work?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The Herglotz trick is basically to define\n$$f(x):=\\pi\\cot\\pi x,\\quad g(x):=\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\sum_{n=-N}^N \\frac{1}{x+n}$$\nand derive enough common properties of these functions to see in the end that they must coincide. Namely, it consists of showing that: $f$ and $g$ are defined for all non-integral values and are continuous there. They are periodic of period 1. They are odd functions. They satisfy the same functional relation $f(\\frac{x}{2})+f(\\frac{x+1}{2})=2f(x)$ and $g(\\frac{x}{2})+g(\\frac{x+1}{2})=2g(x)$. By defining $h(x)=f(x)-g(x)$, and setting $h(x):=0$ for $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, $h$ becomes a continuous function on all of $\\mathbb{R}$ that shares the properties given in (2), (3), and (4). Now the \"trick\" is to use all these properties as follows. Since $h$ is a periodic continuous function, it possesses a maximum $m$. Let $x_0$ be a point in $[0,1]$ with $h(x_0)=m$. It follows from (4) that\n$$h\\left(\\frac{x_0}{2}\\right)+h\\left(\\frac{x_0+1}{2}\\right)=2m,$$\nand hence that $h(\\frac{x_0}{2})=m$. Iteration gives $h(\\frac{x_0}{2^n})=m$ for all $n$, and hence $h(0)=m$ by continuity. But $h(0)=0$, and so $m=0$, that is, $h(x)\\leq 0$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$. As $h(x)$ is an odd function, $h(x)<0$ is impossible, hence $h(x)=0$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question about the Herglotz trick. Let me read through the original question again. The user is asking how the Herglotz trick works, specifically in proving the identity involving the cotangent function and the partial fraction expansion.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states a series representation as a partial fraction expansion where translated reciprocal functions are summed up, matching the poles of the cotangent function and the reciprocal functions. The identity given is π cot(πx) equals the limit as N approaches infinity of the sum from -N to N of 1/(x + n). The user mentions that this is proven using the Herglotz trick and wants an explanation of how it works.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one condition or property applied to one object. In this case, the problem is about proving the identity using the Herglotz trick, so the assumptions would include the definition of the function (the series representation) and any conditions necessary for the trick to apply.\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't specify any particular conditions on x, but maybe the assumption is that the identity holds for all x except integers, since cot(πx) has poles at integers. Also, the series on the right side is a sum over integers n, which would have poles at x = -n, so x must not be an integer. So perhaps the assumption is that x is a complex number not an integer. But the user didn't explicitly mention that. However, in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem is to prove the identity using Herglotz's trick. The key elements are the identity itself and the method (Herglotz trick). So maybe the assumptions are the definition of the function as the partial fraction sum, and perhaps that x is not an integer. But the user didn't state x's conditions, so maybe I need to infer based on standard knowledge of the cotangent partial fraction expansion.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond the identity given. But since the example included the assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't mention it (wait, the original example problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the user structured it with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7). Wait, looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake because the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user intended to restructure the problem with additional constraints? Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, no. The original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem in the example listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong. But the user is providing the example as a guideline. So perhaps in that example, the problem was misformatted. However, in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem according to the format, so I need to follow the example's structure even if the example had an error. Wait, but the user's example might have been a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would restrict n, which is not in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect. But since the user provided that example, maybe they intended that sometimes the original problem might have hidden assumptions. Wait, but 91 is 7*13. Maybe the original problem actually had an additional condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user misrepresented it. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but the user is using it as a template.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, I need to follow the format. The original question here is about proving the identity π cot(πx) = lim_{N→∞} sum_{n=-N}^N 1/(x + n) using the Herglotz trick. So the problem is to explain how the Herglotz trick works in proving this identity.\n\nNow, the assumptions would be the conditions required for the identity to hold. The identity involves a series that converges, so perhaps the assumption is that x is not an integer (since otherwise the denominator becomes zero). Also, the function π cot(πx) is defined for x not integer. So the assumptions might be that x is a complex number not equal to an integer. Additionally, perhaps the convergence of the series as N approaches infinity.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not state these assumptions explicitly, but they are part of the mathematical context. Since the example included assumptions that were not in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), maybe here the assumptions should include that x is not an integer and that the series converges.\n\nBut the original question didn't mention x's conditions, so perhaps the user expects that the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are inherent. The example might have included an extra assumption because the original problem had a mistake. But maybe the user wants to extract all assumptions from the problem as presented.\n\nLooking back, the original problem states: \"There is a series representation as partial fraction expansion where just translated reciprocal functions are summed up, such that the poles of the cotangent function and the reciprocal functions match: π cot(πx) = lim_{N→∞} sum_{n=-N}^N 1/(x+n). This identity can be proven with the Herglotz trick.\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove this identity using the Herglotz trick. The assumptions here are that the series converges to the function π cot(πx) under certain conditions. The key points are the equality of the two expressions and the method (Herglotz trick). The assumptions needed would be the conditions under which the series converges and the identity holds. Typically, for this identity, x is not an integer, and the series is summed symmetrically as N approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a complex number,\n- x is not an integer,\n- The series is summed symmetrically from -N to N as N approaches infinity.\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions the limit as N approaches infinity of the sum from -N to N, so maybe the assumption is that x is not an integer and the convergence of the series. But how to phrase this in the format where each assumption is one line addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n\n- x is a complex number,\n- x is not an integer,\n- The series $\\sum_{n=-N}^N \\frac{1}{x+n}$ converges as $N \\to \\infty$.\n\nBut does the problem state that x is complex? The original problem might just consider real x, but in complex analysis, this identity is usually proven for complex x. Since the problem mentions poles, it's likely in the complex plane.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes x is a real number not an integer. But without more context, it's safer to state x is a complex number not an integer.\n\nAnother assumption could be that the function π cot(πx) is equal to the given series expansion. But that's the problem's statement, not an assumption. The problem is to prove that equality using Herglotz trick. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions required for the proof.\n\nAlternatively, the Herglotz trick itself involves certain steps, like showing two functions satisfy the same functional equation and are thus equal. So maybe the assumptions include properties of the functions involved, like periodicity, poles, etc. But since the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example, which extracted assumptions from the problem statement, not from the method.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem's assumptions included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems to be incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. Wait, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the user's example might have a mistake. But regardless, following the example, the assumptions are listed as separate lines, each with one condition.\n\nIn the current problem, the identity is given, and the question is how the Herglotz trick proves it. So the assumptions from the problem statement are:\n\n- The series is a partial fraction expansion of translated reciprocal functions.\n- The poles of the cotangent function and the reciprocal functions match.\n- The equality is proven using the Herglotz trick.\n\nBut the user is asking to filter unrelated information. The original problem mentions \"translated reciprocal functions are summed up, such that the poles of the cotangent function and the reciprocal functions match\" which is part of the problem's setup. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The function π cot(πx) has poles at integers,\n- The series $\\sum_{n=-N}^N \\frac{1}{x+n}$ has poles at integers,\n- The equality holds for non-integer x.\n\nBut again, how to structure this. The example extracted assumptions from the problem statement, which in that case included that n is an integer (from \"for every integer n\") and added n divisible by 7, which might be part of the solution's requirement. But perhaps in this case, the key assumptions are:\n\n- x is a complex number,\n- x is not an integer,\n- The series $\\sum_{n=-N}^N \\frac{1}{x+n}$ converges as $N \\to \\infty$.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly state these; they are part of the mathematical context. However, since the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), maybe here we need to infer that x must not be an integer for the identity to hold. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a complex number,\n- x is not an integer.\n\nBecause the series has terms 1/(x + n) which would be undefined if x is an integer (since n ranges over integers), hence x cannot be an integer. Also, the cotangent function has poles at integers, so x must not be an integer.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a complex number,\nx is not an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$ \\pi \\cdot \\cot (\\pi x) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\sum_{n=-N}^N \\frac{1}{x+n} $$ using the Herglotz trick.\n\nBut the original problem statement already mentions that the identity can be proven with Herglotz trick, so the problem is to explain how that works. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which in the example turned the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement with assumptions. So following that, the problem part would be \"Prove that [identity] using the Herglotz trick\" with the assumptions that x is complex and not an integer.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as above.",
