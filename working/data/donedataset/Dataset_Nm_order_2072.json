    "Content": "I am trying to prove the following statement: if $X$ is a finite CW complex and if $Y \\to X$ is a $n$ -sheeted covering then $Y$ is a finite CW complex and $\\chi(Y)=n \\cdot \\chi(X)$ . I know the covering space of CW complex is again a CW complex, but I am just not sure how to prove if I have one $k$ -cell, the covering space have $n$ $k$ -cells. The $0$ -cell case is easy. For the $1$ -cell of covering space, we can determine it by considering how $1$ -cell of the CW complex attach to the points. But what about cells, it is not very clear for me.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Given an $m$ -dimensional CW-complex $X$ , one can lift the CW-structure to a CW-structure on $Y$ by lifting the characteristic maps $\\varphi_\\alpha : D^k \\to X$ to the cover $p : Y \\to X$ , which can be done since $\\pi_1(D^k) \\cong 0$ . If degree of $p : Y \\to X$ is $n$ , there are exactly $n$ lifts of $\\varphi_\\alpha$ to $Y$ . So for each $k$ -cell $e^k$ in $X$ , there exists $n$ $k$ -cells in the lifted CW-structure on $Y$ which are mapped homeomorphically onto $e^k$ . Let $C_i$ be the number of $i$ -cells in $Y$ , and $C'_i$ be the number of $i$ -cells in $X$ . From the above analysis, we derive that $C_i = n \\cdot C_i'$ for all $0 \\leq i \\leq m$ . Using the fact that Euler characteristic of a CW-complex $X$ , namely the alternating sum of it's betti numbers, is the same as alternating sum of it's number of cells (dimension of the cellular cochain groups), we conclude $$\\chi(Y) = \\sum_{i = 0}^m (-1)^i C_i = \\sum_{i = 0}^m (-1)^i n C'_i = n \\chi(X)$$ as desired $\\blacksquare$ I missed the essential question of OP up there. If $p : Y \\to X$ is a covering map, $A \\subset X$ is a subspace then $p|_{p^{-1}(A)} : p^{-1}(A) \\to A$ is also a covering map. In particular, take $A = e^k$ where $e^k$ is one of the cells in $X$ . As the only covering space of disks are trivial (of the form $e^k \\times D$ where $D$ is a discrete set), and $p$ is of degree $n$ , $e^k$ must lift to $n$ -many $k$ -cells in $Y$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a covering space Y of a finite CW complex X with an n-sheeted covering has Euler characteristic χ(Y) = n·χ(X). \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Let me read through the question again to identify each condition. The user mentions that X is a finite CW complex, which is one assumption. Then Y → X is an n-sheeted covering, so that's another assumption. They also state that the covering space of a CW complex is again a CW complex, but the user is unsure about the number of k-cells in Y. The problem specifically wants to prove two things: Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y) = n·χ(X). However, the user already knows that Y is a CW complex, so the key assumptions are that X is finite and the covering is n-sheeted. \n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"if X is a finite CW complex and if Y → X is an n-sheeted covering, then Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y) = n·χ(X).\" So the main assumptions are X is a finite CW complex, Y is an n-sheeted covering of X. The problem is to prove both that Y is a finite CW complex and that its Euler characteristic is n times that of X.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions applied to one object each. So here, each assumption should be a single line, each applying to one object. Let me parse this:\n\nAssumption 1: X is a finite CW complex.\n\nAssumption 2: Y → X is an n-sheeted covering space.\n\nThese are the two main assumptions. The problem then is to prove two things: Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y) = n·χ(X). However, the user mentions that they already know covering spaces of CW complexes are CW complexes, so maybe the problem is focused more on the Euler characteristic part. Wait, the original problem statement says \"I am trying to prove the following statement: if X is a finite CW complex and if Y → X is an n-sheeted covering then Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y)=n·χ(X).\" So the problem includes both parts. However, in the example, the assumption included an extra condition (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no: in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, no—the example seems to have modified the problem. Wait, the user's example might have been a mistake? Wait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe that's an example of how to extract assumptions. But in that case, maybe the user's example is wrong. But the user is providing that as their own example. So perhaps in their example, they mistakenly added an extra assumption. But regardless, in the current problem, the user is supposed to extract the assumptions from the original problem. The original problem here states that X is a finite CW complex and Y is an n-sheeted covering. The problem is to prove Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y) = n·χ(X). However, the user's example includes assumptions that are in the problem statement, not additional ones. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. But maybe the example was a mistake. Anyway, the current problem's assumptions should be taken directly from the problem statement. So the problem states two conditions: X is a finite CW complex, and Y → X is an n-sheeted covering. The conclusion to prove is two parts: Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y) = n·χ(X). But the user mentions that they know the covering space is a CW complex, but are unsure about the number of cells. So perhaps in the formatted problem, we only need to list the assumptions given in the problem statement. The user's example may have included an extra assumption, but perhaps that was an error. Therefore, sticking to the problem as stated, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: X is a finite CW complex.\n\nAssumption: Y → X is an n-sheeted covering space.\n\nProblem: Prove that Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y) = n·χ(X).\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption as a single line. So each assumption here would be one line. However, the problem statement includes two conclusions. However, perhaps in the problem field, we include the entire original problem. The original problem is to prove both that Y is a finite CW complex and that χ(Y)=n·χ(X). So the formatted problem should include both. But the user might have simplified it. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the formatted problem included that as an assumption. Similarly, perhaps here, the problem is to take the problem as stated and list the assumptions. The original problem says \"if X is a finite CW complex and if Y → X is an n-sheeted covering then Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y)=n·χ(X)\". So the two conditions (assumptions) are X is finite CW complex, Y is n-sheeted covering. The problem is to prove the two conclusions. But according to the user's example, the formatted problem should list all assumptions from the problem statement, each as a separate line. So the two assumptions here would be:\n\n- X is a finite CW complex.\n\n- Y is an n-sheeted covering space of X.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y) = n·χ(X). However, the user's example included a modified problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems like adding an extra assumption. Perhaps the user's example is incorrect. But regardless, following the current problem's instructions, we need to list the assumptions as given in the problem statement, each as a separate line. So here, the problem states two conditions: X is a finite CW complex, and Y is an n-sheeted covering. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: X is a finite CW complex.\n\nAssumption: Y → X is an n-sheeted covering space.\n\nProblem: Prove that Y is a finite CW complex and χ(Y) = n·χ(X).\n\nBut the user's original question mentions that they already know covering spaces of CW complexes are CW complexes, so maybe the main problem is about the Euler characteristic. However, according to the problem statement, the task is to prove both statements. Therefore, the formatted problem should include both parts. Hence, the final answer would list those two assumptions and the problem as stated.",
