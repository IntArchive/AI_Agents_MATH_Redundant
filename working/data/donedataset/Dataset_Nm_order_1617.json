    "Content": "If the order of all nontrivial elements in a group is 2, then the group is Abelian. I know of a proof that is just from calculations (see below). I'm wondering if there is any theory or motivation behind this fact. Perhaps to do with commutators? Proof: $a \\cdot b = (b \\cdot b)  \\cdot (a \\cdot b) \\cdot (a \\cdot a) = b \\cdot (b \\cdot a) \\cdot (b\\cdot a) \\cdot a = b \\cdot a$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As every non-identity element has order two, $a^{-1} = a$ for any element of the group. Therefore $$[a, b] = aba^{-1}b^{-1} = abab = (ab)^2 = e.$$ Hence the group is abelian. Is this too calculationy?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that a group where every nontrivial element has order 2 is Abelian. The user also mentions a specific proof and asks if there's underlying theory or motivation, like commutators.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The key points here are that the group is such that all non-identity elements have order 2. So, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. The main objects here are the group and its elements.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The group is a group (this is implicit, but maybe necessary to state? Wait, the problem says \"in a group\", so perhaps we need to include that).\n2. For every element in the group, if the element is not the identity, then its order is 2.\n\nWait, the problem states \"the order of all nontrivial elements in a group is 2\". So \"nontrivial\" here means non-identity elements. So each non-identity element has order 2. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The group is a group.\n- For all elements $g$ in the group, if $g \\neq e$ (where $e$ is the identity), then $g^2 = e$.\n\nBut according to the example given, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So in the example, the first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", the second was \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So here, maybe split into two:\n\n1. $G$ is a group.\n2. For every element $g \\in G$, if $g$ is not the identity element, then the order of $g$ is 2.\n\nBut perhaps \"G is a group\" is considered part of the problem statement and not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was about integers n, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But actually, in the original problem, n is given as an integer, so maybe that's part of the problem's premise. However, in the example's formatted problem, the user listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, \"G is a group\" is the first assumption.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"in a group\", so the group is given. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. $G$ is a group.\n2. For every nontrivial element $g \\in G$, the order of $g$ is 2.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that $G$ is Abelian. So the problem is: Prove that $G$ is Abelian under these assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$G$ is a group,\nFor every element $g \\in G$, if $g \\neq e$, then the order of $g$ is 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $G$ is an Abelian group.\n\nWait, but in the original problem's example, the assumption was split into two lines, each addressing one property. So here, the two assumptions are that G is a group and that all non-identity elements have order 2. That seems right.\n\nThe original problem's title is \"Order of nontrivial elements is 2 implies Abelian group\", and the question restates that. The proof given uses the fact that ab = ba by manipulating the elements using their squares. But the user is asking about the theory behind it, but our task is just to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nSo, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$G$ is a group,\nFor every element $g \\in G$, if $g$ is not the identity element, then the order of $g$ is 2.\nProblem: \nProve that $G$ is an Abelian group.\n###",
