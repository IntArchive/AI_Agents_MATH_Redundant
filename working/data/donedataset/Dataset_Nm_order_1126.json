    "Content": "This equality in the title is one answer in the MSE post Funny Identities . At first, I thought it had to do with $7$ being a Mersenne prime , but a little experimentation with Mathematica 's integer relations found, $$\\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi/15)} + \\frac{1}{\\sin(4\\pi/15)} + \\frac{1}{\\sin(7\\pi/15)} = \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi/15)}$$ $$\\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi/31)} + \\frac{1}{\\sin(4\\pi/31)} + \\frac{1}{\\sin(8\\pi/31)} + \\frac{1}{\\sin(15\\pi/31)} = \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi/31)}$$ so the Mersenne number need not be prime. Let $M_n = 2^n-1$. How do we prove that, $$\\frac{1}{\\sin(M_{n-1}\\pi/M_n)}+\\sum_{k=1}^{n-2} \\frac{1}{\\sin(2^k\\pi/M_n)} = \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi/M_n)}$$ indeed holds true for all integer $n>2$? Edit (an hour later): I just realized that since, for example, $\\sin(3\\pi/7)=\\sin(4\\pi/7)$, then the question can be much simplified as, $$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{\\sin(2^k\\pi/M_n)} \\overset{?}{=} \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi/M_n)}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about an identity involving the sum of reciprocals of sine functions at specific angles related to Mersenne numbers. The original example was for n=3,4,5, etc., where M_n = 2^n -1. The identity is presented as a sum of terms like 1/sin(2^k π / M_n) for k from 1 to n-1, which should equal 1/sin(π/M_n). \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that n is an integer greater than 2. The Mersenne number M_n is defined as 2^n -1. The angles in the sine functions are multiples of π/M_n, specifically 2^k π/M_n for k from 1 to n-1. The user also edited to note that some terms can be simplified because sin(3π/7) = sin(4π/7), which might affect the sum's upper limit. However, the final simplified version of the problem they presented is the sum from k=1 to n-1 of 1/sin(2^k π/M_n) equals 1/sin(π/M_n). \n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n > 2.\n3. M_n is defined as 2^n -1.\n4. The sum is over k from 1 to n-1 of 1/sin(2^k π / M_n).\n5. The equality to prove is that this sum equals 1/sin(π / M_n).\n\nEach assumption should be listed line by line, addressing one property or condition. The problem statement is to prove the given equality. I need to make sure there are no extra conditions or assumptions beyond what's necessary. The Mersenne prime mention in the original question is more of a red herring since the user found it works even when M_n isn't prime, so the key is that M_n is 2^n -1 regardless of primality. Also, the edit clarifies the sum's upper limit, so the problem is now simplified to the sum from k=1 to n-1. Therefore, the structured problem should include all these points.",
