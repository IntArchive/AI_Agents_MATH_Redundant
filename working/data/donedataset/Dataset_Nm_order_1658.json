    "Content": "In a course on logic and proofs the professor presented on the following lines to show an example of negation:\n$$\n\\neg (P \\Rightarrow Q) \\ \\ \\ \\  \\Longleftrightarrow \\ \\ \\ \\ P \\wedge \\neg Q\n$$\nI can't wrap my head around why $\\neg (P \\Rightarrow Q)$ would be equivalent to the RHS of the above statement. Somehow, we are going from the fact the $P$ does not imply $Q$ to a statement that says that $P$ is true and $Q$ is not, while the LHS statement doesn't say anything about $P$ being true. Is it this line or I that am missing something? The only logical implication that I can make out of this is that:\n$ \\exists x. P(x) \\Rightarrow \\neg Q(x)$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One way of putting this that might help is the following: what if I told you, \"If the real number $x$ is irrational, then $x^2$ is irrational\"? (Logically, writing $\\mathbb I$ for the set of irrational numbers, this might look like $x \\in \\mathbb I \\to x^2 \\in \\mathbb I$.) Of course, what I'm saying is false, so you object: \"Actually, that's not true. For example $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, yet $\\sqrt{2}^2 = 2$ is rational.\" (Logically, this looks like $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb I \\land \\neg (\\sqrt{2}^2 \\in \\mathbb I)$.) Do you see how your negation of my statement gave you the conjunction? Do you agree that giving an example where $x \\in \\mathbb I$ is false, such as $2 \\notin \\mathbb I \\land 4 \\notin \\mathbb I$ would not have been a refutation of my statement?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then state the problem.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was about proving that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted version listed assumptions that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it says \"for every integer n\", so why is \"n is divisible by 7\" an assumption here? That seems contradictory. Maybe the example had a mistake? But perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated info. Hmm, maybe in the original problem, there was an additional condition that wasn't explicitly stated? Or maybe the example is incorrect. Anyway, moving on.\n\nNow, the current problem is from Math Stack Exchange about the negation of an implication statement. The user is confused about why ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q. The original question points out that the professor presented this equivalence, but the student can't understand why the negation of \"P implies Q\" would mean \"P and not Q\", especially since the left side doesn't mention P being true. The student suggests maybe the negation is ∃x. P(x) ⇒ ¬Q(x), but that's their own thought.\n\nSo, to structure this according to the format: The assumptions would be the premises given in the problem. But in this case, the problem is about logical equivalence, so maybe the assumptions are the definitions or logical axioms used here. Wait, the problem is asking why ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q. The user's confusion is about this equivalence. So, the problem is to understand this equivalence. But according to the example, the assumptions are conditions applied to the objects in the problem. Here, the objects are P and Q, which are propositions. So maybe the assumptions are about P and Q? But the problem isn't making any specific assumptions about P and Q except that they are propositions. So perhaps there are no specific assumptions here except that we're working in classical logic, but the example given had specific numerical conditions. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. But in this logic problem, there's no such numerical conditions. \n\nWait, maybe the assumptions in this case are the logical framework. But the user's format requires each assumption to be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Since the problem is about logical equivalence, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of implication and negation in classical logic. But how to phrase that? Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have specific assumptions beyond what's given in the problem statement. The user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\"). Wait, that seems odd. Wait, in the original problem, it was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted version's assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that contradicts the original problem's statement. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7. Unless there was a misinterpretation. Maybe the example was wrong, but the user provided it as an example, so I need to follow it regardless.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user is asking about the equivalence of ¬(P ⇒ Q) and P ∧ ¬Q. The problem is presented in a logic course where the professor showed this equivalence, and the student is confused. So, perhaps the assumptions here are that P and Q are propositions, and we are working in classical logic. But how to list those as assumptions? The original example listed assumptions about the variable n. Here, the variables are P and Q. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nP and Q are propositions,\nWe are working in classical logic.\n\nBut the original example's assumptions were specific to the problem's variables. The problem here is about the logical equivalence itself, so maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the standard definitions. However, the user's example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them explicitly. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's a contradiction. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", meaning n is any integer. But the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which restricts n. That seems incorrect. Perhaps the example was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to show that sometimes the problem might have hidden assumptions. But this is confusing.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the user's example was flawed, but I need to proceed. For the current problem, the question is about the equivalence ¬(P ⇒ Q) ≡ P ∧ ¬Q. The problem is why this equivalence holds. The user is confused because ¬(P ⇒ Q) doesn't mention P being true, but the RHS does. So, the assumptions here would be the definitions of implication in classical logic. In classical logic, P ⇒ Q is equivalent to ¬P ∨ Q. Therefore, the negation would be ¬(¬P ∨ Q) ≡ P ∧ ¬Q. So, the assumption here is that implication is defined as material implication (P ⇒ Q ≡ ¬P ∨ Q). That's a key assumption. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nImplication is defined as material implication (P ⇒ Q ≡ ¬P ∨ Q),\nNegation follows classical logic laws.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were more about the variables. Hmm. Alternatively, since P and Q are propositions, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a proposition,\nQ is a proposition.\n\nBut that's too trivial. However, following the example's style, which listed \"n is an integer\", which is a type assumption. So maybe here:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a proposition,\nQ is a proposition.\n\nBut the problem is about logical equivalence, so perhaps also:\n\nAssumption:\nThe logic system is classical (two-valued).\n\nBut the example didn't mention the system being classical. Maybe the key assumption here is that we're using material implication. So, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nImplication is interpreted as material implication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user doesn't need to state such assumptions explicitly because they are part of standard logic. However, given the example, perhaps the assumptions are just the objects involved. In the example, \"n is an integer\" was an assumption, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a proposition,\nQ is a proposition.\n\nBut that seems redundant. However, following the example's structure, perhaps that's necessary. The problem is then to prove the equivalence. But the original problem in the example had \"Prove that...\", so the problem part is the statement to prove. Here, the problem is the student's confusion, but the core problem is understanding why ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q. So the problem part would be \"Prove that ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q\".\n\nBut the original question on Math Stack Exchange is asking for the negation of the implication statement, and the user is confused about the equivalence. So the problem is to show or explain why ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q. Therefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a proposition,\nQ is a proposition,\nImplication is defined as material implication.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, P and Q are propositions, so stating that they are propositions could be considered assumptions. Additionally, the definition of implication as material implication is a key assumption here, which is part of classical logic. However, the example didn't mention anything about the definitions, only about the variables. This is a bit conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are just the components of the problem without deeper logical framework. If we follow the example's approach, where the original problem was about n being an integer and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" (even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\"), which seems like a mistake. But perhaps in this case, the problem is about propositions P and Q, so the assumptions are that P and Q are propositions. Then the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem's assumptions are that the logic is classical, but that's usually assumed. Given the example, it's unclear. The example's formatting seems to list conditions on the variables. Here, the variables are P and Q, which are propositions, so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a proposition,\nQ is a proposition.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q.\n\nBut the user's original question is about why this equivalence holds, not necessarily to prove it, but to understand the reasoning. However, the example's problem part was \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the problem statement is as given, and the assumptions are the propositions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as per the user's question: \"Why is ¬(P ⇒ Q) equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q?\" But the example's problem was \"Prove that...\", so maybe we need to rephrase the question into a problem statement. The user's question is asking for the negation of the implication statement, but the core problem is understanding the equivalence. So perhaps the problem is to prove or show the equivalence.\n\nIn summary, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a proposition,\nQ is a proposition.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q.\n\nBut maybe the key assumption here is the definition of implication. Since the user is confused about why the equivalence holds, perhaps the assumption is that implication is defined as ¬P ∨ Q. So:\n\nAssumption:\nImplication is defined as P ⇒ Q ≡ ¬P ∨ Q.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q.\n\nThat would make sense, because using the definition of material implication, you can derive the negation. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, the assumption would be about the definition of implication. However, the example didn't mention the definition of exponentiation or divisibility; it just listed properties of n. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are about P and Q being propositions and the logic being classical. But given the example's approach, it's safer to list P and Q as propositions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond what's given in the problem, so the assumptions section is empty. But the example had assumptions even when the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are simply that P and Q are propositions. The problem is then to prove the equivalence.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nP is a proposition,\nQ is a proposition.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ¬(P ⇒ Q) is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q.\n\nBut the original question on Math Stack Exchange is phrased as \"What is the negation of the implication statement\", and the user is confused about the equivalence. So the problem is to determine the negation of P ⇒ Q, which is given as P ∧ ¬Q, and the user is questioning why that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Show that the negation of P ⇒ Q is equivalent to P ∧ ¬Q\".\n\nIn any case, following the example's structure, where the original problem was restated with assumptions, here the assumptions are the propositions involved. Therefore, the final formatted problem should have assumptions that P and Q are propositions, and the problem is to prove the equivalence.",
