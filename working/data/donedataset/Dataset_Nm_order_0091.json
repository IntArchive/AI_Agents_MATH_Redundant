    "Content": "I need some help understanding this proof: Prove: If a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit. Proof: Let $s_{n_k}$ denote a subsequence of $s_n$. Note that $n_k \\geq k$ for all $k$. This easy to prove by induction: in fact, $n_1 \\geq 1$ and $n_k \\geq k$ implies $n_{k+1} > n_k \\geq k$ and hence $n_{k+1} \\geq k+1$. Let $\\lim s_n = s$ and let $\\epsilon > 0$. There exists $N$ so that $n>N$ implies $|s_n - s| < \\epsilon$. Now $k > N \\implies n_k > N \\implies |s_{n_k} - s| < \\epsilon$. Therefore: $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} s_{n_k} = s$. What is the intuition that each subsequence will converge to the same limit I do not understand the induction that claims $n_k \\geq k$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A sequence converges to a limit $L$ provided that, eventually, the entire tail of the sequence is very close to $L$. If you restrict your view to a subset of that tail, it will also be very close to $L$. An example might help. Suppose your subsequence is to take every other index: $n_1 = 2$, $n_2 = 4$, etc. In general, $n_k = 2k$. Notice $n_k \\geq k$, since each step forward in the sequence makes $n_k$ increase by $2$, but $k$ increases only by $1$. The same will be true for other kinds of subsequences (i.e. $n_k$ increases by at least $1$, while $k$ increases by exactly $1$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: the title is \"Prove: If a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit.\" The question itself is about understanding the proof provided, specifically the induction part that claims n_k >= k.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem is about sequences and their subsequences. The main assumptions here would be related to the convergence of the original sequence and the properties of the subsequence indices.\n\nIn the proof, they mention that n_k >= k for all k, proved by induction. So that's one assumption about the subsequence indices. Also, the original sequence converges to some limit s. Another assumption is that for any epsilon > 0, there exists an N such that for all n > N, the terms of the sequence are within epsilon of s.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that if a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit. The assumptions here are the conditions given in the theorem. The theorem states that the original sequence converges, which is the main assumption. The properties of the subsequence (like n_k >= k) are part of the proof's structure, not the problem's assumptions. Wait, but in the example provided, the assumption included both the variable being an integer and another condition. So in this case, the problem's assumptions would be the premises of the theorem. The theorem is \"If a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit.\" Therefore, the assumption here is that the original sequence converges. The rest are parts of the proof or definitions.\n\nWait, but the user's example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user had written the assumption as n being an integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91. However, in the example, the formatted problem included the assumptions as given in the problem. Wait, perhaps the example might have been incorrect? Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is from a different problem where the user might have made a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user is using that as their own example.\n\nTherefore, following the user's example, perhaps when formatting, they want to list all the assumptions from the problem, including any that are part of the problem statement. So in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the first assumption is that n is an integer. Then maybe the user included an extra assumption in the formatted problem (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would imply the assumption is that n is an integer, but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not in the original problem. That seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but they expect me to follow their formatting, even if it's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example was different. For instance, if the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is an integer divisible by 7. Then the assumptions would be correct. But the user's original example says \"for every integer n\", which would not require divisibility by 7. Hmm. So this is confusing. But perhaps the user's example is wrong, but I should follow their format as per their instruction.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the original problem is: Prove that if a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit. The question is about understanding the induction step in the proof where n_k >= k. So when formatting the problem according to the user's structure, the assumptions would be the premises of the theorem. The theorem states that if a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit. Therefore, the main assumption is that the sequence converges. Additionally, the problem involves a subsequence, which by definition has indices n_k such that n_k is increasing. So another assumption might be that the subsequence indices satisfy n_k >= k, which is part of the proof's setup. However, the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. So perhaps the assumptions here should be:\n\nAssumption: The sequence (s_n) converges to a limit s.\n\nAssumption: (s_{n_k}) is a subsequence of (s_n).\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that if the sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit. So the assumptions would be that the original sequence converges. The rest is part of the conclusion. However, in the proof provided in the question, they use the fact that n_k >= k, which is proven by induction. But is this part of the assumptions? Or is it part of the proof's logic?\n\nIn the example, the user included assumptions that may not have been in the original problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be an error. But perhaps the user intended to show that assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The sequence (s_n) converges to a limit s.\n\n2. (s_{n_k}) is a subsequence of (s_n).\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that under the assumption that the sequence converges, every subsequence converges to the same limit. Therefore, the main assumption is the convergence of the original sequence. The fact that (s_{n_k}) is a subsequence is part of the problem's statement, but not an assumption per se. However, in the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the original problem's statement. So following that, for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The sequence (s_n) converges.\n\n- (s_{n_k}) is a subsequence of (s_n).\n\nProblem: Prove that the subsequence (s_{n_k}) converges to the same limit as (s_n).\n\nWait, but the original problem is more general: \"every subsequence converges to the same limit.\" So perhaps the assumptions should list the convergence of the original sequence and that we are considering an arbitrary subsequence. Then the problem is to show that this arbitrary subsequence converges to the same limit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are just the convergence of the original sequence, and the problem is to prove that any subsequence also converges to that limit. However, according to the user's example, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The sequence (s_n) converges to a limit s.\n\nProblem: Prove that every subsequence of (s_n) converges to s.\n\nBut in the proof provided in the question, they use the fact that n_k >= k. However, that is part of the definition of a subsequence. A subsequence requires that the indices are strictly increasing, i.e., n_1 < n_2 < ..., which implies that n_k >= k. So perhaps that is a property of subsequences, not an assumption. So maybe the user's example is listing the properties as assumptions. But in the example, the original problem's assumption was that n is an integer, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem, even if they are part of definitions. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example had a mistake, but the correct approach here is to list the assumptions given in the problem statement. Since the problem is \"If a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit,\" the only assumption is that the sequence converges. The rest is part of the conclusion. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The sequence (s_n) converges.\n\nProblem: Prove that every subsequence of (s_n) converges to the same limit as (s_n).\n\nBut the user's example included multiple assumptions. However, in the given example, the original problem was \"for every integer n,\" which is an assumption, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7,\" which seems to be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we need to follow their instruction to structure the problem as in the example.\n\nLooking back at the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems wrong because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. This changes the problem. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, and the correct assumptions should only be \"n is an integer,\" without the divisibility by 7. But given that the user provided that example, perhaps they want to include all the conditions from the problem, even if they are part of the universal quantifier. So in the current problem, the original problem says \"If a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit.\" The assumption here is \"the sequence converges,\" and the problem is to prove that every subsequence converges to the same limit. Therefore, following the example's structure:\n\nAssumption: The sequence (s_n) converges to a limit s.\n\nProblem: Prove that every subsequence (s_{n_k}) of (s_n) converges to s.\n\nBut in the original proof provided in the question, they use the property that n_k >= k. This is a property of subsequences since the indices are strictly increasing. However, this is part of the proof's logic, not an assumption of the problem. So perhaps in the user's format, we need to include that as an assumption? But in the problem statement, it's not given as an assumption; it's part of the definition of a subsequence. Therefore, the user's example may have included unnecessary assumptions, but following their lead, perhaps we should list all the necessary conditions for the proof to hold, even if they are part of the definitions.\n\nAlternatively, the user's example might have had a mistake, but we need to proceed as per their instruction. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to list the assumptions as the premises given in the problem statement, which is that the sequence converges. The properties of subsequences (like n_k >= k) are part of the proof, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The sequence (s_n) converges to a limit s.\n\nProblem: Prove that every subsequence of (s_n) converges to s.\n\nBut the user's example included multiple assumptions, so maybe we need to break down the assumptions into individual components. For example, if the original problem had multiple conditions, but in this case, the main assumption is that the sequence converges.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the definition of a subsequence, which requires that the indices are strictly increasing (n_{k+1} > n_k), then another assumption could be that (s_{n_k}) is a subsequence, hence n_k is strictly increasing. However, this is part of the definition of a subsequence, not an extra assumption. But in the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is similar to the definition. Therefore, perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- (s_n) is a sequence that converges to s.\n\n- (s_{n_k}) is a subsequence of (s_n).\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that if a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit. Therefore, the first assumption is that the sequence converges, and the second is that we are considering a subsequence. However, the problem is about \"every subsequence,\" so the second part is part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: The sequence (s_n) converges to a limit s.\n\nProblem: Prove that for every subsequence (s_{n_k}) of (s_n), the subsequence converges to s.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore, if the problem is \"Prove that if a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit,\" the only assumption is the convergence of the sequence. The rest is the conclusion. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The sequence (s_n) converges to a limit s.\n\nProblem: Prove that every subsequence of (s_n) converges to s.\n\nThat seems correct. The user's example had two assumptions, but perhaps in that case, there were two conditions (n being an integer and n divisible by 7). Here, there's only one assumption: the sequence converges. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that single assumption.",
