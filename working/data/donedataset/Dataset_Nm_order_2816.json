    "Content": "$A$ is a normal matrix (i.e. $AA^*=A^*A$, where * denotes the hermitian conjugate). If all its eigenvalues are real, prove that it is Hermitian (i.e. $A^*=A$). I have tried many things but could not complete a proof.\nCould anybody please provide some help?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A matrix $A$ is normal if and only it is diagonalized by some unitary matrix, i.e., there exists a unitary matrix $U$ ( $UU^*=U^*U=I$ ), such that $$\nA=U^*DU,\n$$ with $D$ diagonal, containing the eigenvalues of $A$ in the diagonal. (See here .) In our case the eigenvalues of $A$ are real. Then $$\nA^*=(U^*DU)^*=U^*D^*U=U^*DU=A,\n$$ as $D^*=D$ , since the eigenvalues are real.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given problem according to the specified format. Let me first understand the problem thoroughly.\n\nThe original question is about proving that a normal matrix with real eigenvalues is Hermitian. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and the problem statement. My task is to parse the given Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and structure it into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the format.\n\nFirst, let's look at the problem statement from the user's example. In the example, the original problem had some conditions (assumptions) which were listed line by line. The user then rephrased the problem by extracting those assumptions.\n\nNow, applying that to the current problem. The question is titled: \"A normal matrix with real eigenvalues is Hermitian\". The user mentions that $A$ is a normal matrix (so $AA^*=A^*A$) and all its eigenvalues are real. The goal is to prove $A$ is Hermitian, i.e., $A^*=A$.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n1. $A$ is a normal matrix. This is given by the condition $AA^* = A^*A$.\n2. All eigenvalues of $A$ are real.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that $A$ is Hermitian, meaning $A^* = A$.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is listed separately. The first assumption is about the matrix being normal, the second about the eigenvalues being real. Both apply to the matrix $A$. There's no mention of other objects here, just $A$.\n\nThe user in the example sometimes included additional constraints, but in this case, the problem only has those two conditions. The original question mentions trying many things but not succeeding, which is just context and can be filtered out as per the instructions.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have two assumptions: one about normality and one about real eigenvalues. The problem is to prove Hermiticity. I need to present this clearly in the specified format.\n\nI should check if there are any hidden assumptions. For example, the matrix is over the complex numbers because eigenvalues and normality are typically considered in complex spaces. But the original problem doesn't specify the field. However, in standard matrix theory, especially dealing with Hermitian matrices and eigenvalues, it's usually assumed the field is complex. But since the problem doesn't state this, maybe I shouldn't include it unless it's mentioned. The problem states \"Hermitian conjugate\", which implies the entries are complex. So perhaps the matrix is complex. But the user might not mention it. However, the original problem didn't specify, so maybe we don't need to include that as an assumption. The key given conditions are normality and real eigenvalues.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$A$ is a normal matrix (i.e., $AA^* = A^*A$),\nAll eigenvalues of $A$ are real.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A$ is Hermitian (i.e., $A^* = A$).\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property of the object $A$. The problem is to prove the conclusion based on these assumptions.",
