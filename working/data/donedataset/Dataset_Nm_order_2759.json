    "AcceptedAnswer": "Alternatively: suppose that the function has a complex root; call it $x+iy$; $y\\neq 0$. Then $$\\sum_{r=1}^{70}\\frac{1}{x-r+iy}=\\frac{5}{4}$$ multiply by the conjugate to get $$\\sum_{r=1}^{70}\\frac{x-r-iy}{(x-r)^2+y^2}=\\frac{5}{4}$$ which implies $$\\operatorname{Im}\\left( \\sum_{r=1}^{70}\\frac{x-r-iy}{(x-r)^2+y^2} \\right)=0$$\nor\n$$\\sum_{r=1}^{70}\\frac{-y}{(x-r)^2+y^2}=0$$\nwhich is a contradiction since each term has the same sign and is nonzero.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is to prove that all roots of the equation ∑₁⁷⁰ 1/(x−r) = 5/4 are real. They also mentioned an attempt to relate it to P'(x)/P(x) where P(x) is the product of (x−r) from r=1 to 70, but that didn't work. Additionally, they want a generalization for the condition when such an equation ∑₁ⁿ 1/(x−r) = a has all real roots, given n is a positive integer and a is a real number.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states the equation sum from r=1 to 70 of 1/(x−r) equals 5/4. The variables here are x, r, and the constants involved. The assumptions would be:\n\n- The equation is ∑₁⁷⁰ 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\n- The problem is to prove all roots are real.\n- For the generalization part, n is a positive integer (given as n ∈ ℤ⁺).\n- In the generalization, a is a real number (a ∈ ℝ).\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions proving all roots are real for the specific case where n=70 and a=5/4. The generalization is a follow-up question, but the main problem is about n=70 and a=5/4. However, the user's example shows that assumptions are about the problem's conditions. So for the main problem, the assumptions should include the equation setup and any given constants. Let me parse it again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove all roots of ∑₁⁷⁰ 1/(x−r) = 5/4 are real. The user tried setting the sum as P'(x)/P(x) where P(x) is the product of (x−r). So the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The equation is ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\n- We need to show all roots of this equation are real.\n\nBut the example given in the initial instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, the problem is about x being a variable, and the equation being defined for x not equal to any r from 1 to 70. However, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem had A(n) defined with 5^n and 6^n terms, and the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n divisible by 7. But the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13), so maybe the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, but actually, in the original problem, it was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake, but regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made a typo? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(...) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user's example is incorrect, but perhaps it's intentional. Maybe the user intended to filter out the necessary conditions. Hmm, confusing. Maybe in the example, the problem had a hidden condition that n must be divisible by 7? Wait, 91 is 7*13, so if the original problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but perhaps the user structured it with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user is showing that the problem's assumptions are n is integer, and the conclusion is divisibility by 91. But the example is a bit confusing.\n\nAnyway, returning to the current problem. The main equation is ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4. The problem is to prove all roots are real. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- The equation is given as ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\n- The roots are considered for x, excluding r=1 to 70 (since those would be vertical asymptotes).\n- The coefficients are real numbers (but maybe that's implicit).\n- The problem is to prove all roots are real.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are just the equation itself and the domain of x. Wait, but in the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which were not both stated in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the first assumption is correct, but the second assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" might be part of the problem's hidden requirement, but actually, in the original example problem, it's possible that the problem as stated doesn't require n to be divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that as an assumption. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe there was a mistake in the example.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as:\n\nAssumption: <list of conditions, each line is one condition applied to one object>\n\nProblem: <statement>\n\nSo for the given problem, the main equation is sum from 1 to 70 of 1/(x−r) = 5/4. The problem is to prove all roots are real. So the assumptions should include:\n\n- For each r in {1, 2, ..., 70}, the term 1/(x−r) is defined (i.e., x ≠ r).\n- The equation ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\n- The roots are real numbers not in {1, 2, ..., 70}.\n\nBut maybe that's too detailed. Alternatively, the problem is given as is, so the main assumption is the equation itself and the domain (x is real, x not in {1,...,70}). However, the user's example included specific conditions on variables (like n being integer). Here, the variable is x, and the problem is about x being a real number not in {1,...,70}, but the equation is given. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The equation ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4 is considered.\n- The equation is to be solved for x ∈ ℝ \\ {1, 2, ..., 70}.\n\nBut the user's example didn't list the equation as an assumption, but rather the conditions on the variables. Wait, in the example, the problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be n is an integer, but the conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. But the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to show that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem might have a different assumption. This is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nIn any case, to proceed with the current problem. The main equation is ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4. The problem is to prove all roots are real. The assumptions would be:\n\n- The equation ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\n- The problem is to find roots x in real numbers.\n- The roots must not be in {1, 2, ..., 70} (since those points are excluded from the domain).\n\nBut maybe the key assumption is just the equation, and the problem is to prove all roots are real. The user's example didn't list excluded points, so perhaps it's better to list the main equation as the assumption. Also, the problem includes a follow-up about generalization: find the condition such that ∑_{r=1}^n 1/(x−r) = a has all real roots, where n is a positive integer and a is real. So for the main problem, the assumptions are the specific equation with n=70 and a=5/4. The generalization is a separate problem, but the user wants to structure the original problem first.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation is ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\nx is a real number not in {1, 2, ..., 70}.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots of the equation are real.\n\nBut the user's example didn't list the domain restrictions as assumptions, but rather focused on the properties of variables. Alternatively, since the equation itself implies x ≠ r, maybe the main assumption is the equation. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was about A(n) = 5^n(...) - 6^n(...), and the formatted assumptions were n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was the assumption, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems like a mistake unless the original problem had that condition. Maybe the example was incorrect.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, the assumption is simply the equation given, and the problem is to prove all roots are real. The user's example might have had an error, but I need to follow their structure. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user intended to include both the given condition (n is integer) and an additional assumption (n divisible by 7), but that contradicts the original problem's statement. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest approach is to list the equation as the main assumption, and any explicit conditions given. In the current problem, the equation is given, and we need to prove all roots are real. The original problem doesn't state any conditions on x other than those implied by the equation (x ≠ 1,...,70), so perhaps the assumption is just the equation. However, the problem's title mentions \"all roots\", implying x is a real variable, so perhaps \"x is a real variable\" is an assumption.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation is ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4,\nx is a real number,\nx ∉ {1, 2, ..., 70}.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots of the equation are real.\n\nBut the user's example listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate lines. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The equation ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\n- x is a real number.\n- x ∉ {1, 2, ..., 70}.\n\nBut maybe \"x is a real number\" is part of the problem's context, not an assumption. The problem is to prove that all roots are real, so perhaps the only assumption is the equation itself. Alternatively, since the problem is about roots being real, the domain of x being real is implicit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are just the equation and the structure. Let me think about the example again. In the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem's statement was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption \"n is an integer\" is correct, but \"n is divisible by 7\" was not part of the original problem. This suggests that perhaps the example is flawed, and the user might have intended to include conditions that are necessary for the conclusion. For instance, 91=7*13, so to have A(n) divisible by 91, perhaps n needs to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but the example's formatted problem only includes divisible by 7. This is confusing. Maybe there was a mistake in the example.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the key is to structure the problem as per the user's example. The example included assumptions that were part of the problem statement and perhaps necessary for the solution. In the current problem, the equation is given, and we need to prove all roots are real. The assumptions would be the equation and any conditions on the variables. Since the problem is to prove all roots are real, the main assumption is the equation. The variables are x (real) and the parameters r=1 to 70. However, the user's example listed assumptions about the variable (n is integer) and a condition (n divisible by 7). So for this problem, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation is ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4,\nx is a real number not in {1, 2, ..., 70}.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots of the equation are real.\n\nAlternatively, since the equation's domain already excludes x=r, perhaps the second assumption is redundant. So maybe just:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots of the equation are real.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they listed multiple assumptions line by line. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps here, even if the problem doesn't explicitly state certain conditions, we need to list them. For instance, maybe the problem assumes x is a real number, so that's an assumption. But in the example, \"n is an integer\" was part of the original problem's statement (\"for every integer n\"), so it was listed as an assumption. Here, the problem says \"Prove that all roots...\", implying x is a real variable. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nThe equation ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4 holds.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots are real.\n\nBut the equation holding is the problem's equation, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4 is given,\nx is a real number.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots of the equation are real.\n\nAlternatively, since the equation itself defines the problem, and the roots are for x, maybe the only assumption is the equation. The user's example included two assumptions, so perhaps here we need to split into:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) equals 5/4,\nx is a real number.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots are real.\n\nBut I think the key is to list all given conditions. The problem states the equation, and we need to prove the roots are real. The assumptions are the equation and that x is real (since roots are asked for in real numbers). However, the equation's domain already excludes x=r, so maybe that's implicit.\n\nGiven the example provided, which had two assumptions for a problem stating \"for every integer n\", perhaps the current problem's assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4 is given,\nx is a real number.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots of the equation are real.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's example incorrectly added an assumption not in the original problem, perhaps here we should only list the equation. But to match the user's example, where they included \"n is an integer\" (from the original problem's \"for every integer n\") and added \"n is divisible by 7\" (which wasn't in the original problem), perhaps the current problem's assumptions should include both the equation and x being real.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove all roots are real, the fact that x is real is part of the conclusion, not the assumption. Hmm, this is confusing. The user's example seems to have added an extra assumption not present in the original problem. Maybe the example was incorrectly formatted, and the user intended to include only the conditions given in the problem. For instance, the original example problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\", and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the formatted problem in the example lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which seems incorrect unless there was a mistake.\n\nAssuming that the user's example was incorrect, and that the correct approach is to list the conditions given in the problem, then for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4 is given.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots of the equation are real.\n\nBut the user's example included an extra assumption, so maybe they expect splitting the equation into parts. For instance, the equation is one assumption, and maybe another assumption about the form of the equation. However, in this problem, the equation is straightforward. Perhaps the key is to list each mathematical condition as a separate assumption. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nFor r = 1 to 70, terms 1/(x−r) are included in the sum,\nThe sum of these terms equals 5/4.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots are real.\n\nBut that seems redundant. The equation itself is the sum of those terms equals 5/4. So perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation is ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots are real.\n\nThat's concise and follows the example's structure, where the assumption was the equation involving n and the problem was to prove divisibility. In the user's example, despite the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So here, similarly, the equation is the assumption, and the problem is to prove the roots are real.\n\nAdditionally, the user's question also mentions a generalization: finding the condition such that ∑_{r=1}^n 1/(x−r) = a has all real roots, with n ∈ ℤ⁺ and a ∈ ℝ. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which only includes the main problem, not the follow-up. But the original Math Stack Exchange question includes both the specific case and the generalization. So perhaps the formatted problem should include both, but the example only handled the main problem. The user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" based on the example, which focused on the main problem. Therefore, perhaps the generalization is part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included only that. The current problem's original question includes a request to generalize, but the example didn't include that. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should only address the main question, and the generalization is part of the problem's text but not the assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation is ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots of the equation are real.\n\nBut the user's original question also asks about generalization. However, the example provided by the user only formatted the main problem. It's unclear whether the generalization should be included. The user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". The example included only the main problem, even though the original problem might have had additional parts. Therefore, perhaps the generalization is considered an additional part and should be omitted in the formatted problem, focusing only on the specific case.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation is ∑_{r=1}^{70} 1/(x−r) = 5/4.\nProblem:\nProve that all roots of the equation are real.\n\nThis matches the example's structure, where the main problem is isolated and assumptions are listed.",
