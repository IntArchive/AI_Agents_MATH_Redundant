    "Content": "Let $f:X\\to Y$ be a function, and let $\\{S_{i}:i\\in I\\}$ be a family of subsets of $X$. Then, $$f\\left(\\bigcup_{i\n\\in I}S_i\\right) = \\bigcup_{i\n\\in I}f(S_i).$$ The case where $f(A\\cup B)= f(A)\\cup f(B)$ is trivial and I've proved this many times in other classes. However, I believe that the problem I am running into is with notation. That is, I don't understand what the set $I$ is. Will my proof method be just the same? Also, I would like a little help on one more problem. If $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are subsets of a set $X$, and if $f:X\\to Y$ is an injection, then $f(S_{1}\\cap S_{2})=f(S_{1})\\cap f(S_2)$. Now, I know how to prove $f(S_{1}\\cap S_{2})\\subseteq f(S_{1})\\cap f(S_2)$ if our function is not injective, and I know counterexamples of why it isn't equal our function isn't injective. Unfortunately, I am not sure how to use the fact that our function is injective to prove $f(S_{1})\\cap f(S_2) \\subseteq f(S_{1}\\cap S_{2})$. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you very much! Note: These questions are coming from Rotman's Intro to Abstract Algebra Chapter 2.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and structure it according to the given format. The user is asking about two separate problems related to images of unions and intersections under functions.\n\nFirst, the title mentions the image of the union and intersection of sets. The user starts by talking about proving that the image of a union over an indexed family of subsets is equal to the union of the images. They mention that for two sets, it's straightforward, but they're confused about the notation involving the index set I. So the first problem here is about the union part, and the second is about the intersection when the function is injective.\n\nLooking at the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n1. For the union: Let f: X → Y be a function, and let {S_i : i ∈ I} be a family of subsets of X. Prove that f(⋃_{i ∈ I} S_i) = ⋃_{i ∈ I} f(S_i). They mention that they understand the case for two sets (A ∪ B) but are confused about the index set I and whether the proof method is the same.\n\n2. For the intersection: If S₁ and S₂ are subsets of X and f: X → Y is an injection, prove that f(S₁ ∩ S₂) = f(S₁) ∩ f(S₂). They know how to do one inclusion without injectivity but need help with the reverse inclusion using injectivity.\n\nSo, following the example, the Assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. For the first problem, the function f is from X to Y, the family {S_i} are subsets of X, and I is an index set. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions for each problem are:\n\nFor the union problem:\n- f is a function from X to Y.\n- {S_i : i ∈ I} is a family of subsets of X.\n\nFor the intersection problem:\n- f is an injective function from X to Y.\n- S₁ and S₂ are subsets of X.\n\nBut since the user is asking two separate questions, maybe we need to structure them as two separate problems. However, the original instruction says to structure the problem as per the format given, which in the example handled one problem. But here, the user has two problems. Wait, the example given by the user includes one problem. So perhaps the user expects each problem to be formatted separately. However, the initial instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem separately. But the user here has two problems in one question. Let me check the example again. The example had the original problem mentioning a single statement to prove, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions and the problem. Here, the user's question has two parts: the union equality and the intersection equality. So perhaps each should be a separate problem.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct way is to split them into two separate problems. Let me check the original problem's structure again. The user starts with the union problem, then moves to the intersection problem. Each is a separate problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should probably present both, each with their own assumptions and problem statement.\n\nBut the example given by the user had only one problem. The instructions say \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So if there are two problems, perhaps structure each one separately. However, the user's example had only one problem. Maybe in this case, we need to output two formatted problems.\n\nBut the original instruction says \"the problem\" in the format. However, the user's question has two problems. Hmm. Maybe the assistant needs to handle each problem as separate. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the example, the user included only the main problem. The original question here has two parts. So perhaps the correct approach is to structure each part as a separate problem. Therefore, two separate \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\" blocks. However, the user's example only includes one. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer to have both parts under one assumption and problem, but that might not fit. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer should structure each problem separately. Let me try:\n\nFirst Problem:\nAssumption:\nf is a function from X to Y,\n{S_i : i ∈ I} is a family of subsets of X.\nProblem:\nProve that f(⋃_{i ∈ I} S_i) = ⋃_{i ∈ I} f(S_i).\n\nSecond Problem:\nAssumption:\nf is an injective function from X to Y,\nS₁ is a subset of X,\nS₂ is a subset of X.\nProblem:\nProve that f(S₁ ∩ S₂) = f(S₁) ∩ f(S₂).\n\nBut in the original question, the user is asking about the union first, then the intersection. Each is a separate problem. So structuring each with their own assumptions and problem statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer would need to present both, but according to the format, which is per problem. However, the user's example only had one problem. Since the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", maybe the assistant should present each problem in the same answer, each in the format. But how? The example had one problem. Maybe the answer should list both in separate blocks.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants both in the same format, but perhaps the original question is considered as two separate problems. So in the answer, the assistant should present two formatted problems. However, the user's example shows a single formatted problem. Therefore, perhaps each problem is formatted separately. But given that the original question has two problems, the answer should have two formatted sections.\n\nBut the user's example only had one. So maybe the answer will have two \"###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\" blocks. But perhaps the user expects to have each problem structured. However, in the original problem, the user is combining both into one question. But in the answer, the assistant can split into two separate formatted problems.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants the entire problem as one, but it's two problems. But according to the example, the assistant should process each problem separately. So perhaps the answer will have two parts. Let me check the user's note: \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" The example was a single problem. But here, the original question has two problems. So the assistant should structure each problem as per the format. Therefore, two separate entries.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf is a function from X to Y,\n{S_i : i ∈ I} is a family of subsets of X.\nProblem:\nProve that $$f\\left(\\bigcup_{i \\in I} S_i\\right) = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} f(S_i).$$\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf is an injective function from X to Y,\nS₁ is a subset of X,\nS₂ is a subset of X.\nProblem:\nProve that $$f(S_{1} \\cap S_{2}) = f(S_{1}) \\cap f(S_{2}).$$\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nBut wait, the user's example had the assumptions as bullet points, each on a separate line, each addressing one property. So in the first problem, the assumptions are f: X→Y and {S_i} being subsets of X. Each in a separate line. Similarly, for the second problem, f is injective, S₁ and S₂ are subsets of X. Each as separate lines. So S₁ and S₂ being subsets would each be separate assumptions, even though they are both subsets. But in the example, the user had two assumptions for n: being integer and divisible by 7.\n\nWait, in the example, the user wrote:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption is a single line. Even though both are about n, they are separate. Therefore, in the second problem, S₁ is a subset of X and S₂ is a subset of X would be two separate assumptions. But maybe the assistant can combine them as \"S₁ and S₂ are subsets of X\" as one assumption. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. Therefore, S₁ and S₂ are two different subsets, each should be separate. However, in the original problem statement, the user says \"S₁ and S₂ are subsets of X\". So maybe the assumption is \"S₁ and S₂ are subsets of X\" as a single line. But the example splits two properties of the same object (n being integer, n being divisible by 7). So in this case, S₁ and S₂ are two different objects. Therefore, each should have their own assumption. But the problem states they are both subsets. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an injective function from X to Y,\nS₁ is a subset of X,\nS₂ is a subset of X.\n\nEach on separate lines. That would fit the example's style. Even though S₁ and S₂ are both subsets, they are different subsets, so each is a separate assumption.\n\nSo putting it all together, the two formatted problems would be as follows.",
