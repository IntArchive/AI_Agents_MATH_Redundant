    "Content": "The vertices of a triangle are three uniformly random points on a unit circle. The side lengths are, in random order, $a,b,c$ . Show that $P(ab>c)=\\frac12$ . The result is strongly suggested by simulations, and by my attempt shown below. The simplicity of the result suggests that there may be an intuitive explanation. I am hoping for an intuitive explanation, but if that's not possible then any answer is welcome. (Examples of intuitive explanations are here and here .) My attempt Assume that the circle is centred at the origin, and the vertices of the triangle are: $A(\\cos(-2Y),\\sin(-2Y))$ where $0\\le Y\\le\\pi$ $B(\\cos(2X),\\sin(2X))$ where $0\\le X\\le\\pi$ $C(1,0)$ Let: $a=BC=2\\sin X$ $b=AC=2\\sin Y$ $c=AB=\\left|2\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi-2X-2Y}{2}\\right)\\right|=|2\\sin(X+Y)|$ $P\\left[ab>c\\right]=P\\left[2(\\sin X)(\\sin Y)>|\\sin(X+Y)|\\right]$ This probability is the ratio of the area of the shaded region to the area of the square in the graph below. Rotate these regions $45^\\circ$ clockwise about the origin and then shrink them by a factor of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}$ , by letting $X=x-y$ and $Y=x+y$ . Using symmetry, we only need to consider the left half of the blue \"diamond\". Note that in the left half, $0<x<\\pi/2$ , so $|\\sin(2x)|=\\sin(2x)$ . $P\\left[2(\\sin X)(\\sin Y)>|\\sin(X+Y)|\\right]$ $=P\\left[2(\\sin (x-y))(\\sin (x+y))>\\sin(2x)\\right]$ $=P\\left[(\\sin^2x)(\\cos^2y)-(\\cos^2 x)(\\sin^2 y)>(\\cos x)(\\sin x)\\right]$ $=P\\left[(\\sin^2x)(\\cos^2y)-(\\cos^2 x)(1-\\cos^2 y)>(\\cos x)(\\sin x)\\right]$ $=P\\left[\\cos^2 y>\\cos^2 x+(\\cos x)(\\sin x)\\right]$ $=P\\left[ -f(x)<y<f(x)\\right]$ where $\\color{red}{f(x)=\\arccos\\left((\\cos x)\\sqrt{1+\\tan x}\\right)}$ . Noting that $f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=0$ , the probability is $$\\dfrac{\\int_{\\pi/4}^{\\pi/2}f(x)\\mathrm dx}{\\frac12\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^2}$$ Numerical evidence suggests that $\\int_{\\pi/4}^{\\pi/2}f(x)\\mathrm dx=\\frac{\\pi^2}{16}$ , but I don't know how to prove this. If that's true, then the probability is indeed $1/2$ . Context This question was inspired by a question , \"If $(a,b,c)$ are the sides of a triangle, what is the probability that $ac>b^2$ ?\" Generalization I found a generalization, which may or may not help in finding an intuitive explanation. For $k\\in\\mathbb{R^+}$ , we have $$P(ab<kc)=\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arctan k$$ or equivalently, $$P\\left(\\frac{ab}{c}<k\\right)=\\frac{\\arctan k}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$$ Proof : Using the set-up in the above \"My attempt\", we have $P[ab\\color{red}{>}kc]$ $=P\\left[2(\\sin X)(\\sin Y)>k|\\sin(X+Y)|\\right]$ $=P\\left[2(\\sin (x-y))(\\sin (x+y))>k\\sin(2x)\\right]$ $=P\\left[(\\sin^2x)(\\cos^2y)-(\\cos^2 x)(\\sin^2 y)>k(\\cos x)(\\sin x)\\right]$ $=P\\left[(\\sin^2x)(\\cos^2y)-(\\cos^2 x)(1-\\cos^2 y)>k(\\cos x)(\\sin x)\\right]$ $=P\\left[\\cos^2 y>\\cos^2 x+k(\\cos x)(\\sin x)\\right]$ $=P\\left[ -g(x)<y<g(x)\\right]$ where $\\color{red}{g(x)=\\arccos\\left((\\cos x)\\sqrt{1+k\\tan x}\\right)}$ . Noting that $g\\left(\\arctan k\\right)=0$ , the probability is $$\\dfrac{\\int_{\\arctan k}^{\\pi/2}g(x)\\mathrm dx}{\\frac12\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^2}$$ To evaluate the integral in the numerator, I copy the method in @Zacky's answer , adjusted for the presence of $k$ . $$I=\\int_{\\arctan k}^{\\pi/2} \\arccos\\left(\\cos x \\sqrt{1+k\\tan x}\\right)dx\\overset{\\cot x\\to x}=\\int_0^{1/k} \\frac{\\arccos \\sqrt{\\frac{x(k+x)}{1+x^2}}}{1+x^2}dx$$ $$=\\int_0^{1/k} \\frac{\\arctan \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{1-kx}{k+x}}}{1+x^2} dx\\overset{\\large \\frac{1-kx}{k+x}\\to x}=\\int_0^{1/k} \\frac{\\operatorname{arccot} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{1-kx}{k+x}}}{1+x^2}dx$$ $$\\Rightarrow 2I=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\int_0^{1/k} \\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx\\Rightarrow \\boxed{I=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\arctan \\frac1k}$$ Above it was utilized that $\\, \\arccos x =\\arctan \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}\\right)$ and $\\arctan x+\\operatorname{arccot} x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ . $\\therefore P(ab>kc)=\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arctan\\frac1k$ $\\therefore P(ab<kc)=1-\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arctan\\frac1k=\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arctan k$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a way to finish the last integral making use of its symmetry. $$I=\\int_\\frac{\\pi}{4}^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\arccos\\left(\\cos x \\sqrt{1+\\tan x}\\right)dx\\overset{\\cot x\\to x}=\\int_0^1  \\frac{\\arccos \\sqrt{\\frac{x(1+x)}{1+x^2}}}{1+x^2}dx$$ $$=\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\arctan \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{1-x}{1+x}}}{1+x^2} dx\\overset{\\large \\frac{1-x}{1+x}\\to x}=\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\operatorname{arccot} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{1-x}{1+x}}}{1+x^2}dx$$ $$\\Rightarrow 2I=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx\\Rightarrow \\boxed{I=\\frac{\\pi^2}{16}}$$ Above it was utilized that $\\, \\arccos x =\\arctan \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}\\right)$ and $\\arctan x+\\operatorname{arccot} x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse through this problem and structure it properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor, filter out the unnecessary information, and format the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about showing that the probability P(ab > c) = 1/2 when the vertices of a triangle are three random points on a unit circle, with side lengths a, b, c. \n\nLooking at the user's example, they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, I need to extract the key assumptions from the problem description.\n\nThe problem mentions that the vertices are three uniformly random points on a unit circle. The side lengths are a, b, c in random order. The key here is the uniform distribution of points on the circle. The user's attempt also assumes the circle is centered at the origin and parameterizes the points with angles, but those might be part of their solution approach, not the problem's inherent assumptions. \n\nWait, the problem statement itself says \"The vertices of a triangle are three random points on a unit circle.\" So the main assumptions are:\n\n1. The triangle's vertices are three random points on a unit circle.\n2. The points are chosen uniformly.\n3. The side lengths are a, b, c (in random order).\n\nBut wait, in the example given earlier, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The vertices are three uniformly random points on a unit circle.\n- The side lengths a, b, c are considered in random order.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any additional constraints, like fixing one vertex or anything. The user's attempt does fix one vertex at (1,0) and parameterizes the others using angles, but that's their method, not part of the problem's given conditions.\n\nSo the problem's actual assumptions are:\n\n1. The triangle has vertices at three uniformly random points on a unit circle.\n2. The side lengths are labeled a, b, c in random order.\n\nThe problem is to show that the probability P(ab > c) is 1/2.\n\nWait, but the user's own problem setup in their attempt might have more assumptions. For example, they fix one point at (1,0) and parameterize the other points with angles X and Y. But that's part of their solution approach. The original problem doesn't specify any such conditions. The original problem is more general.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should include only the given assumptions from the problem statement, not the user's solution steps. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The vertices of the triangle are three uniformly random points on a unit circle.\n- The side lengths of the triangle are labeled as a, b, c in random order.\n\nProblem: Show that the probability P(ab > c) is equal to 1/2.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property, applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe triangle's vertices are three random points on a unit circle,\nThe points are chosen uniformly,\nThe side lengths are labeled as a, b, c in random order.\n\nBut \"labeled as a, b, c in random order\" is a single condition. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe triangle's vertices are three uniformly random points on a unit circle,\nThe side lengths are a, b, c in random order.\n\nBut the problem's original statement already says \"The vertices of a triangle are three random points on a unit circle. The side lengths are, in random order, a, b, c.\"\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n1. Uniformly random points on a unit circle.\n2. Side lengths are labeled randomly as a, b, c.\n\nHence, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vertices of the triangle are three random points on a unit circle,\nThe points are chosen uniformly,\nThe side lengths are labeled a, b, c in random order.\n\nWait, but \"chosen uniformly\" is part of the first assumption. The problem states \"three uniformly random points\". So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe triangle's vertices are three uniformly random points on a unit circle,\nThe side lengths a, b, c are in random order.\n\nBut \"three uniformly random points\" covers the first two points. So perhaps split into:\n\nAssumption:\nThe triangle's vertices are three random points on a unit circle,\nThe points are chosen uniformly,\nThe side lengths are labeled a, b, c in random order.\n\nBut in the example, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, \"three random points on a unit circle\" and \"chosen uniformly\" could be two separate assumptions. Wait, \"uniformly random points\" implies both that they are random and uniformly distributed. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vertices of the triangle are three points chosen uniformly at random on a unit circle,\nThe side lengths are labeled a, b, c in random order.\n\nBut \"uniformly at random\" is a single condition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe triangle's vertices are three points selected uniformly at random on a unit circle,\nThe side lengths a, b, c are in random order.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The first applies to the vertices, the second to the labeling of the side lengths.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe vertices of the triangle are three points selected uniformly at random on a unit circle,\nThe side lengths a, b, c are labeled in random order.\nProblem: Show that $P(ab > c) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n###\n\nI need to check if the user's example included any specific mathematical conditions. In the example, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumptions are about the selection of points and the labeling of sides. So this should be correct.",
