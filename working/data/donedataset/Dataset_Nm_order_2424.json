    "AcceptedAnswer": "A circle is indeed planar, and has constant nonzero curvature, but the torsion of a circle is zero; it's not an exception. Having said this, let $\\gamma(s)$ be a regular planar curve in $\\Bbb R^3$ parametrized by arc length, say $\\gamma:I \\to \\Bbb R^3$ , where $I \\subset \\Bbb R$ is an open interval. $\\gamma(s)$ regular means $\\dot{\\gamma}(s) = \\dfrac{d\\gamma(s)}{ds} \\ne 0 \\tag{1}$ for any $s \\in I$ . If $P \\subset \\Bbb R^3$ is any plane passing through the point $\\vec p_0 \\in \\Bbb R^3$ , then the points $\\vec r = (x, y, z) \\in P$ satisfy an equation of the form $(\\vec r - \\vec p_0) \\cdot \\vec n = 0, \\tag{2}$ where $\\vec n$ is the unit normal vector to $P$ ; that $P$ may be so described is well-known, and will be taken so here without further demonstration. If we insert $\\gamma(s) = (\\gamma_x(s), \\gamma_y(s), \\gamma_z(s))$ into (2), we see that $(\\gamma(s) - \\vec p_0) \\cdot \\vec n = 0, \\tag{3}$ and differentiating (3) we obtain $\\dot \\gamma(s) \\cdot \\vec n = 0. \\tag{4}$ We next recall that $\\dot \\gamma(s) = \\vec T(s), \\tag{5}$ where $\\vec T(s)$ is the unit tangent vector to $\\gamma(s)$ , $\\vec T(s) = \\dot \\gamma(s)$ (since $s$ is arc-length); then by (4) $\\vec T(s) \\cdot \\vec n = 0; \\tag{6}$ furthermore, by the Frenet-Serret equation $\\dot {\\vec T}(s) = \\kappa \\vec N(s), \\tag{7}$ applied to (6) we have $\\kappa(s) \\vec N(s) \\cdot \\vec n = \\dot {\\vec T}(s) \\cdot \\vec n = 0; \\tag{8}$ from (8) we see that, as long as $\\kappa(s) \\ne 0$ , that is, as long as $\\vec N(s)$ may be defined , we have $\\vec N(s) \\cdot \\vec n = 0 \\tag{9}$ holding as well as (6); thus both $\\vec T(s)$ and $\\vec N(s)$ are normal to $\\vec n$ as long as they are defined. Now $T(s)$ and $N(s)$ form an orthonormal system; that is $\\Vert \\vec T(s) \\Vert = \\Vert \\vec N(s) \\Vert = 1$ and $\\vec T(s) \\cdot \\vec N(s) = 0$ , and since the unit binormal vector along $\\gamma(s)$ , $\\vec B(s) = \\vec T(s) \\times \\vec N(s)$ also satisifies $\\vec B(s) \\cdot \\vec T(s) = (\\vec T(s) \\times \\vec N(s)) \\cdot \\vec T(s) = 0, \\tag{10}$ $\\vec B(s) \\cdot \\vec N(s) = (\\vec T(s) \\times \\vec N(s)) \\cdot \\vec N(s) = 0, \\tag{11}$ $\\vec B(s) \\cdot \\vec B(s) = 1, \\tag{12}$ we may conclude from the continuity of $\\vec B(s)$ that $\\vec B(s) = \\pm \\vec n, \\tag{13}$ a constant ; thus from $\\dot {\\vec B}(s) = -\\tau(s) \\vec N(s), \\tag{14}$ the Frenet-Serret equation for $\\dot {\\vec B}(s)$ , we may infer that $\\tau(s) \\vec N(s) = 0 \\Rightarrow \\tau(s) = 0, \\tag{15}$ since $\\vec N(s) \\ne 0$ wherever it is defined; we have shown that the torsion $\\tau(s)$ of any plane curve $\\gamma(s)$ vanishes. Of course, there are a couple of caveats in the above argument, most notably the assumptions of regularity (so that $\\vec T(s)$ exists), and non-vanishing curvature (so that $\\vec N(s)$ exists); but I think these can be covered pretty easily; I'll defer the discussion until after we have handled the \"if\" direction of the assertion's logic. So suppose $\\tau(s) = 0$ ; that is, that $\\gamma(s)$ is a regular curve in $\\Bbb R^3$ with vanishing torsion. Then $\\vec B(s)$ must be constant along $\\gamma(s)$ , by (14); choosing $s_0 \\in I$ we have $\\vec B(s_0) = \\vec B(s)$ for all $s \\in I$ ; thus by (10)-(11) $\\vec T(s)$ and $\\vec N(s)$ both belong to the subspace $V \\subset \\Bbb R^3$ with $\\vec B(s_0) \\bot V$ ; indeed, we may take this subspace to be spanned by $\\vec T(s_0)$ , $\\vec N(s_0)$ , since they form an orthonormal pair in $V$ ; $V = \\text{span} \\{ \\vec T(s_0), \\vec N(s_0) \\}$ . This being the case, we may write $\\dot {\\gamma}(s) = \\vec T(s) = \\langle \\vec T(s), \\vec T(s_0) \\rangle \\vec T(s_0) + \\langle \\vec T(s), \\vec N(s_0) \\rangle \\vec N(s_0); \\tag{16}$ upon integrating (16) we find $\\gamma(s) - \\gamma(s_0) = \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\dot {\\gamma}(u) du = \\int_{s_0}^s \\vec T(u) du$ $= \\left (\\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\langle \\vec T(u), \\vec T(s_0) \\rangle du \\right ) \\vec T(s_0) + \\left (\\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\langle \\vec T(u), \\vec N(s_0) \\rangle du \\right ) \\vec N(s_0), \\tag{17}$ which implies that $(\\gamma(s) - \\gamma(s_0)) \\cdot \\vec B(s_0)$ $ =(\\int_{s_0}^s \\langle \\vec T(u), \\vec T(s_0) \\rangle du) \\langle \\vec T(s_0), \\vec B(s_0) \\rangle$ $+ (\\int_{s_0}^s \\langle \\vec T(u), \\vec N(s_0) \\rangle du) \\langle \\vec N(s_0), \\vec B(s_0) \\rangle = 0 \\tag{18}$ for all $s \\in I$ ; but the equation of the plane normal to $\\vec B(s_0)$ passing through the point $\\gamma(s_0)$ is in fact $(\\vec r - \\gamma(s_0)) \\cdot \\vec B(s_0) = 0, \\tag{19}$ where $\\vec r = (x, y, z)$ . Thus $\\gamma(s)$ lies in this plane. QED. We can actually take things a step further and present concise formulas for $\\vec T(s)$ and $\\vec N(s)$ in terms of $\\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u)du$ as follows: When $\\tau(s) = 0$ , the Frenet-Serret equations become $\\dot{\\vec T}(s) = \\kappa(s) \\vec N(s), \\tag{20}$ $\\dot{\\vec N}(s) = -\\kappa(s) \\vec T(s), \\tag{21}$ and $\\dot {\\vec B}(s) = 0. \\tag{22}$ (22) implies $B(s)$ is constant; inspecting (20)-(21) reveals they may be written in combined form by introducing the six-dimensional column vector $\\vec \\Theta(s)$ : $\\vec \\Theta(s) = (\\vec T(s), \\vec N(s))^T, \\tag{23}$ so that $\\dot {\\vec \\Theta}(s) = (\\dot {\\vec T}(s), \\dot {\\vec N}(s))^T; \\tag{24}$ with this convention, (20)-(21) may be written $\\dot {\\vec {\\Theta}}(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\kappa(s)I_3 \\\\ -\\kappa(s)I_3 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\vec {\\Theta}(s) = \\kappa(s) J \\vec{\\Theta}(s), \\tag{25}$ where $I_3$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix and $J = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & I_3 \\\\ -I_3 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}; \\tag{26}$ here it is understood that $J$ is presented in the from of $3 \\times 3$ blocks.  It is easy to see that $J^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & I_3 \\\\ -I_3 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & I_3 \\\\ -I_3 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -I_3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -I_3 \\end{bmatrix} = -I_6, \\tag{27}$ $I_6$ being the $6 \\times 6$ identity matrix.  Careful scrutiny of (25) suggests that $\\vec \\Theta(s) = \\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right ) \\vec \\Theta(s_0) \\tag{28}$ might be its unique solution taking the value $\\vec \\Theta(s_0)$ at $s = s_0$ ; indeed, we may differentiate (28) with respect to $s$ to obtain $\\dot {\\vec \\Theta}(s) = \\dfrac{d}{ds}\\left (\\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u)du \\right )J\\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right ) \\vec \\Theta(s_0) = \\kappa(s) J \\vec \\Theta(s), \\tag{29}$ showing that (28) satisfies (25); furthermore (28) is consistent with the initial condition at $s = s_0$ ; $\\vec \\Theta (s_0) =  \\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^{s_0} \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right ) \\vec \\Theta(s_0) = e^{0J} \\vec \\Theta(s_0) = \\vec \\Theta(s_0). \\tag{30}$ It is worth pointing out that the reason (28) works as a solution is basically that the $s$ -derivative of the matrix $\\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right )$ follows the scalar pattern $\\dfrac{d}{ds}e^{u(s)} = \\dfrac{du(s)}{ds}e^{u(s)}, \\tag{31}$ viz. $\\dfrac{d}{ds}\\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right ) = \\dfrac{d}{ds}\\left (\\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right)J\\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right )$ $= \\kappa(s)J\\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right ). \\tag{32}$ (32) applies by virtue of the fact that $\\left ( \\displaystyle\\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right)J$ and its derivative $\\kappa(s) J$ commute with one another, being scalar function multiples of the same matrix $J$ ; for general matrix functions $A(s)$ , it is not true that $A'(s)A(s) = A(s)A'(s)$ , and the evaluation of $(d/ds)A(s)$ becomes much more complicated; we do not in general have $\\dfrac{d}{ds}e^{A(s)} = \\dfrac{A(s)}{ds}e^{A(s)} \\tag{33}$ in parallel with the scalar formula (31); the interested reader may consult my answer to this question (especially the material surrounding equations (15)-(20)) for a more detailed discussion.  However, under the special circumstances that $A(s) = f(s)B$ for a constant matrix $B$ , then $A'(s) = f'(s)B$ and $A(s)A'(s) = f(s)f'(s)B^2 = A'(s)A(s)$ ; $A(s)$ and its derivative always commute in this special case, which is what we have here.  (32) applies and thus we have that (28) solves (25). We examine the matrix $\\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right )$ occurring in (28) with an eye to determining its structure, and the structure of the solutions to (25).  That $J^2 = - I_6$ has been noted.  Thus we have $J^2 = -I_6; \\; \\; J^3 = J^2J = -J; \\;\\;$ $J^4 = J^3J= -J^2 = I_6; \\; \\; J^5 = (J^4)J = I_6J = J, \\tag{34}$ and in general, $J^{4n + p} = J^{4n}J^p = (J^4)^nJ^p = (I_6)^n J^p = J^p, \\tag{35}$ which shows that all cases of $J^m$ , $m \\in \\Bbb Z$ , are in fact covered by (34), i.e. for $0 \\le p \\le 3$ .  If we expand the matrix $\\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right )$ as a power series $\\exp \\left (\\left ( \\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right ) J \\right )$ $= \\displaystyle \\sum_0^\\infty \\dfrac{\\left ( \\left (\\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du) \\right )J \\right )^n}{n!} = \\sum_0^\\infty \\dfrac{\\left (\\displaystyle \\int_{s_0}^s \\kappa(u) du \\right )^nJ^n}{n!}, \\tag{36}$ we may decompose the right-hand sum in accord with the periodicity relations of the powers of $J$ , (34)-(35), as follows:  we first observe that the pattern of powers of $J$ is essentially the same as that of the powers of the ordinary complex number $i$ , viz. , $i^2 = -1; \\; \\; i^3 = i^2i = -i; \\;\\;$ $i^4 = i^3i = -i^2 = 1; \\; \\; i^5 = (i^4)i = 1i = i, \\tag{37}$ $i^{4n + p} = i^{4n}i^p = (i^4)^ni^p = 1^n i^p = i^p, \\tag{38}$ which give rise to the well-known Euler formula $e^{ix} = \\cos x + i\\sin x \\tag{39}$ for $e^{ix} = \\displaystyle \\sum_0^\\infty \\dfrac{(ix)^n}{n!} \\tag{40}$ when this sum is split into its real and imaginary parts; that is, $\\Re[e^{ix}] = \\cos x = \\displaystyle \\sum_0^\\infty (-1)^n \\dfrac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} \\tag{41}$ and $\\Im[e^{ix}] = \\sin x  = \\displaystyle \\sum_0^\\infty (-1)^n \\dfrac{x^{2n + 1}}{(2n + 1)!}, \\tag{42}$ To be continued/completed; stay tuned!!?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem based on the user's example. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"A space curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0\". The user's question is asking for an explanation of the proof, mentioning that a circle is planar but has nonzero constant curvature, which seems contradictory and confusing them.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem statement about space curves being planar if and only if torsion is everywhere zero, the key assumptions here would relate to the properties of the curve. So the assumptions should include that the space curve is planar and that its torsion is zero everywhere. Also, the user mentioned a circle with constant curvature but non-zero, which might be part of the confusion. However, in the problem statement, the torsion being zero is the main condition. The example given in the user's original question includes two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So similarly, here the assumptions should be the two parts of the \"if and only if\" statement.\n\nWait, the problem is an \"if and only if\" statement. So the problem has two directions. But the user is confused because a circle is planar and has zero torsion but non-zero curvature. The problem's proof might involve showing both directions: if a space curve is planar, then torsion is zero, and conversely, if torsion is zero everywhere, then the curve is planar. However, the user's example question seems to have an issue with the circle's curvature, but the torsion part is zero. So maybe the user is mixing up torsion and curvature. The original problem's title states the equivalence between planarity and zero torsion, so the key assumptions here would be the two conditions: the curve is planar and torsion is zero. But since it's an if and only if, perhaps each direction requires different assumptions. However, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the problem is a theorem, so the assumptions would be the properties of the curve in each direction.\n\nWait, the original problem is to prove the equivalence. So when proving \"if a space curve is planar, then its torsion is everywhere zero\", the assumption is that the curve is planar, and the problem is to show torsion is zero. Conversely, for the other direction, assuming torsion is zero everywhere, prove the curve is planar. However, the user might be presenting this as a single problem. So perhaps the formatted problem would have two parts. But the example given by the user had two assumptions listed. Wait, in the example, the original problem had an error because the assumption that n is divisible by 7 was not in the original problem, but the user included it. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake there. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. But perhaps the example was a bad one, or maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated information. But in reality, the original problem doesn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, this might be confusing. But perhaps the user wants to extract the key assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, no, the user's instruction says: \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem into assumptions and problem. So maybe in the example, the problem actually did have an unstated assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't mention it. But that seems odd. Maybe the example is incorrect. Anyway, perhaps in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nThe problem is to prove that a space curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere zero. So this is a biconditional statement. Therefore, the problem has two parts: 1. If a space curve is planar, then its torsion is everywhere zero. 2. If a space curve has torsion everywhere zero, then it is planar. Each part would have different assumptions.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed as line by line. In the example, two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So maybe in the current problem, the assumptions would be for each direction. However, the problem is presented as an equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. The space curve is planar.\n2. The torsion of the space curve is everywhere zero.\n\nBut the problem is to show the equivalence, so perhaps the problem is stated as \"Prove that a space curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere zero.\"\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions listed, even if they were part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had a mistake. Maybe the example was a mistake. So perhaps the user intended to extract the assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. But in this case, the problem is a theorem, so the assumptions would be the conditions in the theorem.\n\nSo for the theorem \"A space curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0\", the assumptions for each direction are:\n\nFor the forward direction: Assume the space curve is planar. Prove torsion is zero everywhere.\n\nFor the reverse direction: Assume torsion is zero everywhere. Prove the curve is planar.\n\nBut the problem is stated as an equivalence. So in the formatted problem, perhaps the assumptions are the two conditions, but since it's an if and only if, maybe the user wants to list both as assumptions? But that's not correct. The problem is to show the equivalence. Therefore, the problem statement would be the biconditional, and the assumptions would be the properties of the space curve in each direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to split the problem into two separate problems, each with their own assumptions. But according to the example, the user might list the assumptions as separate lines. Wait, in the example, the original problem had a single assumption (for all integers n), but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error, but perhaps the example is illustrative of how to structure, even if the example is incorrect. So maybe in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: The space curve is planar.\n\nProblem: Prove that its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nand\n\nAssumption: The torsion of the space curve is everywhere 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that the space curve is planar.\n\nBut the user's example listed two assumptions for a single problem. So perhaps the correct way is to list the two parts as separate problems. However, the original problem is a single biconditional statement. The user might want to present it as a single problem with two assumptions. But that might not fit the example. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions would be that the curve is a space curve (maybe that's an assumption) and that torsion is defined everywhere. But those are general conditions. Alternatively, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the general context of the problem. The example given had an incorrect assumption added, so maybe the user is expecting to extract assumptions from the problem. However, in the original problem statement, there are no explicit assumptions beyond the curve being a space curve. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are just that it's a space curve. But in the example, the problem was about integers n, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which may not have been in the original. So perhaps the user is expecting to infer assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example was a mistake, and the actual process is to extract the conditions that are given in the problem. In the current problem, the question is about a space curve being planar iff torsion is zero. The assumptions for each direction would be:\n\nFor the \"if\" part (torsion zero implies planar), the assumption is torsion is zero everywhere.\n\nFor the \"only if\" part (planar implies torsion zero), the assumption is the curve is planar.\n\nBut the problem is stated as a biconditional. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be split into two parts. However, the user's example has two assumptions for a single problem. Maybe the answer should list both directions as separate problems. But the user's example shows that for a single problem, multiple assumptions can be listed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions are the two conditions, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented as two separate implications, each with their own assumptions. But the original problem is one question. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to list both assumptions (planar and torsion zero) and the problem is to show they are equivalent. But that's not precise. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is the equivalence, and the assumptions are the properties required for each direction.\n\nBut given the user's example, where the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original, perhaps the user is expecting to infer implicit assumptions. However, in that example, adding n divisible by 7 is incorrect because the original problem states for every integer n, so the correct formatted problem should not have that assumption. Therefore, perhaps the example is flawed, and the correct approach is to list the assumptions that are explicitly given in the problem. \n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about the proof of the statement that a space curve is planar iff its torsion is zero everywhere. The user is confused because a circle is planar and has zero torsion but non-zero curvature. The actual theorem states that torsion being zero is equivalent to planarity, regardless of curvature. So the curvature is not directly part of the assumptions. The assumptions would be about the torsion and the planarity. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions related to the curve being a space curve (but that's implicit) and then the two conditions for each direction. However, the problem as stated is an equivalence, so the assumptions would be either planar or torsion zero, depending on the direction. But since the user's example listed two assumptions for a single problem, perhaps here it's better to list both conditions as assumptions and the problem is to prove their equivalence. Alternatively, since it's an if and only if, maybe the assumptions are that the curve is a space curve, and the problem is the equivalence. But the example didn't include implicit assumptions like \"n is an integer\" if that's part of the problem statement.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". The formatted problem listed that as an assumption. Then, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an extra assumption, which might have been a mistake. But perhaps in the actual answer, the user's example had a mistake, and we should focus on the current problem.\n\nFor the current problem, the user's question is about understanding the proof. The original problem (theorem) is \"A space curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0\". Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The space curve is planar.\n\nProblem: Prove that its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nAnd\n\nAssumption: The torsion of the space curve is everywhere 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that the space curve is planar.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they might expect both directions to be combined. However, the example had two assumptions for a single problem. So maybe here, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: \nThe space curve is planar,\nThe torsion of the space curve is everywhere 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that a space curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nBut that's redundant because the assumptions are the two parts of the equivalence. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions are the general context (space curve), and the problem is the statement. But the example included specific assumptions. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to follow the structure of the example, even if it's not perfect. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was formatted as an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then, there was an additional assumption added that \"n is divisible by 7\", which might have been a mistake. But assuming that the user wants to split the problem into the conditions given, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: The space curve is planar.\n\nProblem: Prove that its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nand another problem:\n\nAssumption: The torsion of the space curve is everywhere 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that the space curve is planar.\n\nBut the user's format seems to require a single problem with multiple assumptions. Alternatively, since the original problem is an equivalence, maybe the assumptions are that it's a space curve (implicit) and the problem is the biconditional statement. But the example included an extra assumption, so maybe here we just list the two parts as assumptions and the problem as the equivalence. However, that's not correct because assumptions are conditions given, and the problem is what needs to be proven. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as follows:\n\nAssumption: The space curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nBut that's the problem statement itself. Hmm. I think the example provided by the user might have been structured incorrectly, but to adhere to their format, perhaps the correct approach here is to list the two conditions as separate assumptions and the problem as the equivalence. However, since it's an if and only if, it's more accurate to have two separate problems. But the user's example had a single problem with two assumptions. Therefore, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to format it as two separate assumptions for each direction and the problem as proving the equivalence. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, given the user's example, maybe the assumptions are the conditions for each direction, and the problem is the equivalence. But that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is an equivalence, the assumptions would be the properties of the space curve, and the problem is to prove both directions. However, in the example, the assumptions included both the general condition (n is an integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7), but in reality, the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but following their structure, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: The space curve is planar.\n\nProblem: Prove that its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nAssumption: The torsion of the space curve is everywhere 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that the space curve is planar.\n\nBut the original problem is a single statement. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to present it as two separate problems. However, the user's example combined them into one. Given that, maybe the answer is:\n\nAssumption: \nThe space curve is planar,\nThe torsion of the space curve is everywhere 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that a space curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nBut listing both conditions as assumptions is redundant because they are the two parts of the equivalence. Therefore, perhaps the correct format is to list the assumptions as the general context (the curve is a space curve) and then the problem is the equivalence. However, in the example, they listed n is an integer, which is part of the problem statement. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumption is that it's a space curve, and the problem is the equivalence. But the original problem's title already states it's a space curve. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe curve is a space curve.\n\nProblem: Prove that the curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nBut the user's example didn't include such an assumption explicitly. For example, in the example, the original problem mentions \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. Similarly, here, \"space curve\" is part of the problem's context. Therefore, the assumption should be that the curve is a space curve, and then the problem is the equivalence. But the user's example didn't have that. The example had the variable's property (n is an integer) and an added assumption (n divisible by 7). Therefore, maybe in this case, the assumption is simply that the curve is a space curve, and the problem is the equivalence. However, the user's confusion in the question is about a circle being planar with zero torsion but non-zero curvature, which might relate to the proof. But that's part of the user's confusion, not the problem's assumptions. \n\nGiven all this, perhaps the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe curve is a space curve.\n\nProblem: Prove that the curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nAlternatively, since the theorem is about space curves in general, the assumption is inherent. However, to match the example, which listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption (which was part of the original problem's statement), here \"the curve is a space curve\" would be the assumption. But the original problem's title already states \"a space curve\", so that's given. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumption that it's a space curve, and the problem is the equivalence. However, the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), so maybe that's a mistake, but we should follow the structure regardless. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require any assumptions beyond what's in the title. The title is the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted problem would have no assumptions and the problem is the equivalence. But the example had assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them (except for \"n is an integer\"). Therefore, in this case, the assumption is that the curve is a space curve, and the problem is the equivalence. So:\n\nAssumption: The curve is a space curve.\n\nProblem: Prove that it is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nBut the title already says \"a space curve\", so perhaps that's redundant. However, to follow the example's structure, where \"n is an integer\" was an assumption even though it's part of the original problem's statement, here \"the curve is a space curve\" should be listed as an assumption. \n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe curve is a space curve.\n\nProblem: Prove that the curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is \"A space curve is planar if and only if its torsion is everywhere 0\", so the assumption is that we're dealing with a space curve, and the problem is to prove the equivalence. That makes sense. \n\nHowever, the user's confusion is about the circle example, which is planar, has zero torsion, but has non-zero curvature. The user is confused because they think the theorem might contradict this, but actually, the theorem doesn't mention curvature. The torsion being zero is the key. So the proof should show that planarity implies zero torsion and vice versa, regardless of curvature. But that's part of the solution, not the problem structure. \n\nIn conclusion, following the example's structure, the formatted problem should have the assumption that the curve is a space curve and the problem is to prove the equivalence.",
