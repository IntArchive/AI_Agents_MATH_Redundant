    "Content": "Could anyone try to prove that the below conjectured formula is valid for relating $\\pi$ with ALL of its convergents - those, which are described in OEIS via $\\mathrm{A002485}(n)/\\mathrm{A002486}(n)$ ? $$ (-1)^n\\cdot\\left( \\pi - \\frac{\\mathrm{A002485}(n)}{\\mathrm{A002486}(n)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{|i|\\cdot2^j} \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^l(1-x)^{2(j+2)}(k+(i+k)x^2)}{1+x^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x \\tag{1} $$ (1) and in Maple notations: $$(-1)^n*(Pi−A002485(n)/A002486(n))=(abs(i)*2^{j})^{}(-1)Int((x^{l}(1-x)^{(2*(j+2))}*(k+(i+k)*x^{2}))/(1+x^{2}),x=0...1)$$ where integer $n >2$ serves as the index for terms in OEIS $\\mathrm{A002485}(n)$ and $\\mathrm{A002486}(n)$ , and $\\{i, j, k, l\\}$ are some integer parameters (which are some implicit functions of $n$ and so far to be found experimentally for each value of $n$ ), . When n->infinity then A002485(n)/A002486(n)->Pi while the integral will approach value of 0.\nSo the way to strengthen or to disproof my conjecture is to see wether there exists set of i, j, k and l under which integral, and consequently, the resulting expression consisting of  hypergeometric and gamma functions attains the value of zero (0). It is shown in examples below that the formula under question is applicable for some first few convergents (of the $\\mathrm{A002485}(n)/\\mathrm{A002486}(n)$ type). For example, for $\\frac{22}{7}$ $$\\frac{22}{7} - \\pi = \\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^4(1-x)^4}{1+x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$ with $n=3, i=-1, j=0, k=1, l=4$ - with regards to my above suggested generalization. In Maple notation, i:=-1; j:=0; k:=1; l:=4;\nInt(x^l*(1-x)^(2*(j+2))*(k+(k+i)*x^2)/((1+x^2)*(abs(i)*2^j)),x= 0...1) yields 22/7 - Pi. It also works for found by Lucas formula for $\\frac{333}{106}$ $$\\pi - \\frac{333}{106} = \\frac{1}{530}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^5(1-x)^6(197+462x^2)}{1+x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$ with $n=4, i=265, j=1, k=197, l=5$ - with regards to my above suggested generalization. In Maple notation i:=265; j:=1; k:=197; l:=5;\nInt(x^l*(1-x)^(2*(j+2))*(k+(k+i)*x^2)/((1+x^2)*(abs(i)*2^j)),x= 0...1) yields Pi - 333/106. And it works for Lucas's formula for $\\frac{355}{113}$ $$\\frac{355}{113} - \\pi = \\frac{1}{3164}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^8(1-x)^8(25+816x^2)}{(1+x^2)}\\mathrm dx$$ with $n=5, i=791, j=2, k=25, l=8$ - with regards to my above suggested generalization. In Maple notation i:=791; j:=2; k:=25; l:=8;\nInt(x^(2*(j+2))*(1-x)^l*(k+(k+i)*x^2)/((1+x^2)*(abs(i)*2^j)),x= 0...1) yields 355/113 - Pi. And it works as well for Lucas's formula for $\\frac{103993}{33102}$ $$\\pi - \\frac{103993}{33102} = \\frac{1}{755216}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^{14}(1-x)^{12}(124360+77159x^2)}{1+x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$ with $n=6, i= -47201, j=4, k=124360, l=14$ -with regards to my above suggested generalization. In Maple notation i:=-47201; j:=4; k:=124360; l:=14;\nInt(x^l*(1-x)^(2*(j+2))*(k+(k+i)*x^2)/((1+x^2)*(abs(i)*2^j)),x= 0...1) yields Pi - 103993/33102 And also it works Lucas's formula for $\\frac{104348}{33215}$ $$\\frac{104348}{33215} - \\pi = \\frac{1}{38544}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^{12}(1-x)^{12}(1349-1060x^2)}{1+x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$ with $n=7, i= -2409, j=4, k=1349, l=12$ - with regards to my above suggested generalization. In Maple notation i:=-2409; j:=4; k:=1349; l:=12;\nInt(x^l*(1-x)^(2*(j+2))*(k+(k+i)*x^2)/((1+x^2)*(abs(i)*2^j)),x= 0...1) yields 104348/33215 - Pi And it works as well for $\\frac{618669248999119}{196928538206400}$ which, by the way, is not part of A002485/A002486 OEIS sequences: $$\\frac{618669248999119}{196928538206400} - \\pi = \\frac{1}{755216}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{x^{14}(1-x)^{12}(77159+124360x^2)}{1+x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$ with $i= 47201, j=4, k=77159, l=14$ -with regards to my above suggested generalization. In Maple notation i:=47201; j:=4; k:=77159; l:=14;\nInt(x^l*(1-x)^(2*(j+2))*(k+(k+i)*x^2)/((1+x^2)*(abs(i)*2^j)),x= 0...1) yields\n618669248999119/196928538206400 - Pi. This question relates to my answer given in Is there an integral that proves $\\pi > 333/106$? Update#1: Recently Thomas Baruchel (see his answer below) has conducted extensive calculations and found that four parameters formula yields infinite number of solutions for each $n$ . Thomas shared with me his calculations results and supplied me with quite a few of valid combinations of $i, j, k, l$ values - so now I have a lot of experimentally found five-tuples $\\{ n,i, j, k, l\\}$ , which satisfy above parametrization, where $n$ varies in the range from 2 to 26. Looking at all available {i,j,k,l} solutions (initial ones found by me and those which were found by Thomas Baruchel program) one could observe that in all of them abs(l-j)=2*m where \"m\" is some positive integer. Based on this data, of course, it would be nice to find how (if at all) $i, j, k, l$ are inter-related between each other and with \" $n$ \" - but such inter-relation (if exists) is not obvious and difficult to derive just by observation ... (though it is clearly seen that an absolute value of \" $i$ \" is strongly increasing as \" $n$ \" is growing from 2 to 26). Update #2: Thanks to Jaume Oliver Lafont, at least one case, answering affirmatively to the last question, is identified: i=-1, j=-2, k=1, l=0 $$\\pi = \\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{4}{1+x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$ Should there be an infinite number of such cases? David Trimas looked into the option involving partial solution for my conjecture by setting j=l=0 and deriving formulas for \"i\" and \"k\" for j=l=0 condition. The result is following: (-1) ^ n * (Pi − A002485(n)/A002486(n)) = ((Abs(i)) * 2 ^ j) ^ (-1) * Int((x ^ l * (1 - x) ^ (2 * (j + 2)) * (k + (i + k) * x ^ 2 ))/(1 + x ^ 2 ), x=0 ...1) holds true for any n>2 and j=l=0 when i =(-1)^(n) * 3 * A002486(n) k = (-1)^(n) * (47 * A002486(n) - 15 * A002485(n) For example for n=3 where A002485(3)=22 and A002486(3)=7 i=(-1)^3 3 7=-21 k=(-1)^3*(47 7 - 15 22)=1 and the quick check via Inverse Symbolic Calculator using Maple (also could be done using Mathematica) provides the confirmation. i:=-21;j:=0;k:=1;l:=0;(abs(i) 2^j)^(-1) int((x^l (1-x)^(2 (j+2))*(k+(i+k)*x^2))/(1+x^2),x=0...1) = 22/7 - Pi Substitution of i =(-1)^(n) * 3 * A002486(n) and k = (-1)^(n) * (47 * A002486(n) - 15 * A002485(n) into general conjectured formula with the condition that j=l=0 (under which above formulas for \"i\" and \"k\" were derived) confirmed those formulas for \"i\" and \"k\" validity by bringing lhs and rhs to be equal. Though above finding is obviously circular in nature (it doesn't reveal direct dependency of \"i\" and and \"k\" on \"n\" but rather does it via A002485(n) and A002486(n) ) - it is in my view a step forward. As I mentioned above, observation of all obtained solutions for my conjectured identity (which represents generalization of Stephen Lucas' experimentally obtained identities between Pi and its convergents) shows that abs(l-j)=2*m\nwhere \"m\" is some positive integer.\nGoing further I make another conjecture re identity which relates Log(2) and its convergents and is analogous to the one which relates Pi and its convergents. Below is conjectured by me formula (expressed in Maple notations) for relating Log(2) (that is Ln(2)) with ALL of its convergents - those, which are described via A079942(n)/A079943(n) ratio where A079942(n) and A079943(n) are OEIS integer sequences. (-1)^n*(Log(2) − A079942(n)/A079943(n))=(Abs(i) 2^j)^(-1) Int((x^l (1-x)^(2 (j+2))*(k+(i+k)*x^2))/(1+x^2),x=0...1) where integer n>2 serves as the index for the terms in the OEIS A079942(n) and A079943(n) integer sequences, and {i,j,k,l} are some signed integer parameters (which are some implicit functions of “n” and to be found experimentally or otherwise for each value of “n”) , and abs(l - j) = 2*m + 1, where “m\" is some positive integer.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Not giving the solution, but some ideas that could lead to it. If this formula works, it will be because the integral can be decomposed on $P(x) + \\frac{1}{1+x^2}$. It's easy to integrate a polynomial (and will give you a rational number), and $1 \\over {1+x^2}$ will give you arctan and as such $\\pi \\over 4$. So, taking the problem in reverse, you can look at the expansion of arctan between 0 and $\\pi \\over 4$. You can then convert that polynomial in a continued fraction that will give you the approximations you're looking at. This reference could help http://www.math.binghamton.edu/dikran/478/Ch7.pdf (p10) I'll try to have a closer look later. EDIT: Ok, so after peeking through Mathoverflow as well, here is the idea. Starting from the very general following integral:\n$I_n = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^l(1-x)^m(\\alpha + \\beta x^2) }{\\gamma(1+x^2)}dx$. As previously discussed, you want to be able to represent this as follows:\n$\\int_0^1 \\frac{P(x)(1+x^2) + C}{\\gamma(1+x^2)}dx$ with $P(x)$ a polynomial and $C$ a constant. With some algebra on the polynomials you know that $P(x)= Q(x)(1+x^2) + Ax+B$. So you want to find $A=0$ and if possible get some ideas on $B$. You need to evaluate the above polynomial on $x=i=e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ and $-i$ to identify the coefficient. $ A=0 \\Leftrightarrow P(i)=P(-i)=0  \\Leftrightarrow A = \\Im (i^l(1-i)^m(\\alpha - \\beta) ) = (\\alpha - \\beta) 2 ^\\frac{m}{2} \\sin(\\frac{l \\pi}{2} + \\frac{-m\\pi}{4} ) = (\\alpha - \\beta) 2 ^\\frac{m}{2} \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{4} (2l-m) )$ So we have a condition on $2l-m$ to zero $A$ which is $\\frac{\\pi}{4} (2l-m) = K\\pi \\Leftrightarrow 2l-m \\equiv 0 [4]$. In particular, $m=2m'$ which we will use going forward and $l-m' \\equiv 0[2]$. We can set $l-m' = 2 \\epsilon$ Second part is to look at $B$ $B= \\Re (i^l(1-i)^m(\\alpha - \\beta) ) = (\\alpha - \\beta) 2 ^\\frac{m}{2} \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4} (2l-m) ) = (\\alpha - \\beta) 2 ^{m'} \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} (l-m') ) = (\\alpha - \\beta) 2 ^{m'} (-1)^\\epsilon$ So, to sum up, we have $I_n = \\int_0^1 Q(x) + \\frac{B}{\\gamma(1+x^2)}$. As you're trying to approximate $\\pi$, you need to take $\\gamma = B/4$. So, provided that $\\int_0^1 Q(x) dx$ can be used to approximate fractions of $\\pi$, which is likely given the numbers of degress of freedom, we've proved that $I_n$ would be of the following form, which is slightly better as you can drop $j$ from your variables and it shows some relationships better (provided that $\\alpha - \\beta \\not = 0)$: $(-1)^n (\\pi- \\frac{p_n}{q_n}) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^{\\epsilon+2m'}(1-x)^{2m'}(\\alpha + \\beta x^2) }{(\\alpha - \\beta) 2 ^{m'-2} (-1)^{\\epsilon}(1+x^2)}dx$. In your last example, that yields: $n=6,m'=6,\\epsilon = -8,\\alpha = 77159, \\beta = 124360$ I leave it to you to verify it works on the rest of them.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified assumption and problem sections. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about proving a conjectured formula that relates π to all its convergents, specifically the ones listed in OEIS sequences A002485(n) and A002486(n). The formula involves an integral with parameters i, j, k, l that are functions of n. The user provides several examples where specific values of these parameters yield known approximations of π, like 22/7, 333/106, etc. There's also an update mentioning that these parameters might follow certain patterns, like |l - j| being even, and a similar conjecture for Log(2).\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The problem states that for each integer n > 2 (since n serves as the index for the OEIS sequences), there exist integers i, j, k, l (implicit functions of n) such that the given integral formula holds. Additionally, the examples show that |l - j| is a multiple of 2, which the user later mentions as |l - j| = 2m for some integer m. However, this seems like an observed pattern rather than a given assumption. The problem also mentions that when n approaches infinity, the convergent approaches π, and the integral approaches 0.\n\nWait, but the main assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is an integer greater than 2.\n2. The formula relates π to its convergents A002485(n)/A002486(n) via the integral.\n3. The parameters i, j, k, l are integers dependent on n.\n4. The absolute difference between l and j is an even integer (from the observation |l - j| = 2m).\n\nBut the problem itself is to prove that for every n > 2, such integers i, j, k, l exist so that the equation holds. The user also mentions another conjecture for Log(2), but that's a separate part and not included in the original problem about π.\n\nHowever, in the example given by the user, the assumption included specific conditions applied to one object each. So for the original problem here, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is an integer greater than 2.\n- The convergent A002485(n)/A002486(n) approximates π.\n- There exist integers i, j, k, l such that the integral formula equals (-1)^n (π - A002485(n)/A002486(n)).\n- The integral's parameters i, j, k, l are functions of n.\n- The absolute difference |l - j| is an even integer (from the observed pattern).\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove the formula holds for all n > 2 with such parameters. However, the original problem states that the conjecture is whether the formula is valid, and the task is to prove or disprove it by finding such parameters or showing they exist. The updates mention that parameters have been found experimentally, but a general proof is needed.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nEach assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n > 2.\n3. The convergents A002485(n)/A002486(n) approach π as n increases.\n4. For each n, there exist integers i, j, k, l such that the integral expression equals (-1)^n (π - A002485(n)/A002486(n)).\n5. The parameters i, j, k, l are functions of n.\n6. The absolute difference |l - j| is an even integer.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the below conjectured formula is valid for relating π with ALL of its convergents\". So the main assumption is that such parameters exist for each n > 2. But the problem is to prove that this formula is valid, i.e., for each n > 2, there exist integers i, j, k, l such that the equation holds. The other conditions (like |l - j| being even) might be observations that could help in the proof but are not given assumptions.\n\nHowever, the user's updates mention that these patterns are observed but not proven. Therefore, the assumptions should be the necessary conditions given in the problem statement, not the observed patterns. The original problem does not state that |l - j| is even as a condition; that's an observation from examples. Therefore, the assumptions should only include what is given in the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n- The formula (1) is conjectured to be valid for all convergents A002485(n)/A002486(n) of π.\n- n is an integer > 2.\n- The parameters i, j, k, l are integers (implicit functions of n) to be found.\n- The integral expression equals (-1)^n (π - A002485(n)/A002486(n)).\n\nThus, the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n > 2.\n3. The convergents A002485(n)/A002486(n) are considered.\n4. Parameters i, j, k, l are integers dependent on n.\n5. The integral expression equals (-1)^n (π - A002485(n)/A002486(n)).\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that the formula holds. So the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed. The problem itself is to show that for each n > 2, such integers i, j, k, l exist making the equation true. Therefore, the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is to prove the formula under those assumptions.\n\nBut the example given by the user in the initial instruction had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7\". In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no: in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Maybe the example was wrong. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. However, the instruction says that the formatted problem should list all assumptions of the problem. If the original problem has no restrictions, but the answer requires certain conditions, then perhaps the example is wrong. But given that the user provided that example, maybe they want to split the problem's given conditions into separate assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question says \"for integer n > 2\", so that's an assumption. The formula involves parameters i, j, k, l which are integers dependent on n. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n > 2.\n3. i, j, k, l are integers dependent on n.\n4. The convergents A002485(n)/A002486(n) approximate π.\n5. The integral expression is as given.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that the formula (1) holds for all n > 2 with some integers i, j, k, l. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer greater than 2.\n- The formula involves parameters i, j, k, l which are integers dependent on n.\n- The integral is defined as per the given expression.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove the formula's validity given that it works for specific cases. So the main assumptions are n being an integer >2 and the existence of the parameters. But the problem itself is the conjecture that such parameters exist for all n >2. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should list the given conditions, which are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n > 2.\n- The convergents A002485(n)/A002486(n) are considered.\n- Parameters i, j, k, l are integers (implicit functions of n).\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are the ones given in the problem statement. The problem states that the formula is conjectured to be valid for all convergents, which are indexed by n >2. So the necessary conditions are n being integer >2, and the rest is part of the problem to prove.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n > 2.\n3. i, j, k, l are integers dependent on n.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that for each such n, there exist integers i, j, k, l such that the equation holds. So the assumptions are n is integer >2, and the problem is to show the existence of the parameters making the integral equal to the difference.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn > 2,\ni, j, k, l are integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$ (-1)^n\\cdot\\left( \\pi - \\frac{\\mathrm{A002485}(n)}{\\mathrm{A002486}(n)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{|i|\\cdot2^j} \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^l(1-x)^{2(j+2)}(k+(i+k)x^2)}{1+x^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x $$ holds for some integers i, j, k, l dependent on n.\n\nBut in the example, they split each assumption line by line. So each assumption should be a separate line, each addressing one property.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn > 2,\ni, j, k, l are integers,\ni, j, k, l are dependent on n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the equation $$ (-1)^n\\cdot\\left( \\pi - \\frac{\\mathrm{A002485}(n)}{\\mathrm{A002486}(n)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{|i|\\cdot2^j} \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^l(1-x)^{2(j+2)}(k+(i+k)x^2)}{1+x^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x $$ holds.\n\nBut the user's example included specific assumptions from the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. But given that the user included that example, perhaps they want to include all implicit assumptions. However, in the current problem, the original question states that n >2, so that's an explicit assumption. The parameters i, j, k, l are to be found, so their integrality is part of the problem's conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should be the given conditions in the problem statement.\n\nSo the problem is to prove that for each integer n >2, there exist integers i, j, k, l (dependent on n) such that the equation holds. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer greater than 2.\n- i, j, k, l are integers.\n\nBut the problem is to show existence of such integers. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions that n is an integer >2, and the parameters are integers. Each of these is a separate line.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove that the formula is valid for all n >2 with some integers i, j, k, l. The original problem doesn't state that i, j, k, l are integers as an assumption; rather, it's part of the conjecture that such integers exist. So the conjecture is that for each n >2, there exist integers i, j, k, l making the formula valid. Therefore, the problem is to prove that for each n >2, such integers exist. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n > 2.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove the existence of integers i, j, k, l such that the equation holds.\n\nBut in the user's example, they included assumptions beyond the original problem. For instance, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted version added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but if following the user's example, perhaps the assistant should structure based on the problem's explicit conditions.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem explicitly states \"integer n >2\" and that parameters are integers. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn > 2,\ni, j, k, l are integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$ (-1)^n\\cdot\\left( \\pi - \\frac{\\mathrm{A002485}(n)}{\\mathrm{A002486}(n)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{|i|\\cdot2^j} \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^l(1-x)^{2(j+2)}(k+(i+k)x^2)}{1+x^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x $$ holds for some integers i, j, k, l dependent on n.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the parameters are \"some implicit functions of n\", so maybe that's another assumption:\n\ni, j, k, l are functions of n.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property. So splitting into:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn > 2,\ni, j, k, l are integers,\ni, j, k, l are functions of n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the conjectured formula relates π to its convergents via the given integral expression.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the formula (1) holds for all n >2 with the specified parameters.\n\nBut to adhere to the example's structure, perhaps list the key assumptions:\n\n- n is an integer >2.\n- The convergents A002485(n)/A002486(n) are considered.\n- Parameters i, j, k, l are integers dependent on n.\n\nBut each on separate lines.\n\nAlternatively, given the original problem's statement, the assumptions are n being an integer >2, and the problem is to prove the formula with integers i, j, k, l.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn > 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist integers i, j, k, l such that $$ (-1)^n\\cdot\\left( \\pi - \\frac{\\mathrm{A002485}(n)}{\\mathrm{A002486}(n)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{|i|\\cdot2^j} \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^l(1-x)^{2(j+2)}(k+(i+k)x^2)}{1+x^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x $$.\n\nBut the original problem states that the formula is conjectured to be valid, and the task is to prove or disprove it. However, the user's instruction is to structure the problem as Assumptions and Problem, based on the original question. The original question is seeking a proof of the formula, so the problem is to prove the formula holds under the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, after this lengthy thinking, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n > 2.\n- i, j, k, l are integers dependent on n.\n\nBut each on separate lines. The problem is to prove the equation holds for these parameters.\n\nSo final formatted answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn > 2,\ni, j, k, l are integers,\ni, j, k, l are dependent on n.\nProblem:\nProve that $$ (-1)^n\\cdot\\left( \\pi - \\frac{\\mathrm{A002485}(n)}{\\mathrm{A002486}(n)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{|i|\\cdot2^j} \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^l(1-x)^{2(j+2)}(k+(i+k)x^2)}{1+x^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x $$.",
