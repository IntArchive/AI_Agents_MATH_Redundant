    "Content": "I'd like to have my proof verified and if possible, to see other solutions that are interesting. Proof : Suppose $n(n+1)$ is a square. Then we write\n$$n(n+1) = \\prod_{p} p^{c(p)}$$\nwhere $c(p) = a(p) + b(p)$ are such that\n\\begin{align*}\nn &= \\prod_p p^{a(p)} \\\\\nn+1 &= \\prod_p p^{b(p)}\n\\end{align*}\nNow, by our hypothesis, $c(p)$ is even for all primes $p$. As $(n,n+1)=1$ for all $n$, it must be that $a(p)$ and $b(p)$ are even for all primes $p$ and moreover, $a(p) = 0$ whenever $b(p)>0$ and reversely. This indicates that both $n$ and $n+1$ are squares. This is impossible as there are no consecutive squares in the natural numbers.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at the problem the user provided. The task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, which includes listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. The example given helps clarify how to extract assumptions from the original problem.\n\nThe original problem is titled \"Show that the product of two consecutive natural numbers is never a square.\" The user's example formatted a similar problem by listing assumptions and then the problem statement. So, I need to parse this question and extract the assumptions and the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem is about proving that n(n+1) is never a square where n is a natural number. The assumptions here would be about the properties of n and the conditions given. Let's break it down.\n\nAssumptions needed are the conditions that must hold for the problem. The problem states \"two consecutive natural numbers,\" so the first assumption is that n is a natural number. Then, the numbers are consecutive, so n and n+1. Since they are consecutive, they are coprime (gcd(n, n+1) = 1). The problem also implies that their product is a square, which would require each of them to be squares individually because they are coprime. However, the user's proof uses that fact, but the problem itself doesn't state that as an assumption—it's part of the proof.\n\nWait, the problem's assumptions should be only the given conditions. The problem is to show that for any natural number n, n(n+1) is not a square. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. The product n(n+1) is considered.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state any additional conditions like n being even or odd, or divisible by something. It's general for all natural numbers. However, in the example provided, sometimes assumptions are derived from the problem's context. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem in the example was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was modified. Wait, the user's example shows that in the original problem, the user might have made a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user intended to structure a problem where the assumption is that n is divisible by 7, perhaps from a different problem. Hmm, perhaps the example was illustrative but not accurate. Anyway, focusing on the current problem.\n\nThe problem here is to show that the product of two consecutive naturals is never a square. The assumptions should be:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\nBut since the problem is about any two consecutive natural numbers, maybe that's the only assumption. Wait, the problem statement is general. So the problem is: given n is a natural number, show that n(n+1) is not a square.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were listing properties. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. Consider the product of n and n+1.\n\nBut the second point might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has an implicit assumption that n and n+1 are coprime, but that's a derived property, not an assumption. The user's proof uses that gcd(n, n+1) = 1, which is a known property. So the only explicit assumption here is that n is a natural number.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user starts by saying \"Suppose n(n+1) is a square,\" which is part of the proof by contradiction. But in the problem statement to be formatted, the problem is to show that n(n+1) is never a square. So the problem itself is to prove that for all natural numbers n, the product is not a square. Therefore, the only assumption needed is that n is a natural number.\n\nWait, but maybe the original problem didn't specify \"natural number\" but just said \"two consecutive natural numbers\". Wait, the title is \"Show that the product of two consecutive natural numbers is never a square.\" So the problem is about natural numbers. Therefore, the assumption is that n is a natural number. The problem is to prove that n(n+1) is not a square.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps in that example, the problem had an additional condition. So for the current problem, the only assumption is that n is a natural number. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the product of two consecutive natural numbers, n(n+1), is never a square.\n\nWait, but the original problem's question in the user's input is: \"Show that the product of two consecutive natural numbers is never a square.\" So the problem is already stated. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem says \"two consecutive natural numbers,\" the key assumptions are that n is a natural number and n+1 is the next natural number. But since the problem is about consecutive numbers, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. The numbers considered are n and n+1.\n\nBut perhaps the second is redundant as n+1 is implied by consecutive. Alternatively, maybe just \"n is a natural number\" suffices because the problem is about n and its successor.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the product of two consecutive natural numbers, n(n+1), is never a square.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states \"two consecutive natural numbers,\" maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. The first number is a natural number.\n2. The second number is the next natural number (i.e., consecutive).\n\nBut perhaps splitting it into two separate assumptions. However, the example given by the user had two assumptions for the example problem: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So maybe here, the consecutive part is inherent in the problem statement, so the assumptions are just n being a natural number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumption is that n and n+1 are consecutive natural numbers. But how to phrase that. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nn and n+1 are consecutive natural numbers.\n\nBut the user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So each assumption is about one object (n) and one property. Here, n is a natural number. The consecutive part is part of the problem's statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that for any natural number n, the product n(n+1) is not a square. So the assumption is n is a natural number, and the problem is to show the product is never a square.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the product n(n+1) is never a square.\n\nAlternatively, to align with the problem's title, which mentions \"two consecutive natural numbers,\" perhaps the problem statement should be as in the title, but the assumption is n is a natural number.\n\nBut according to the user's example, in the formatted problem, the problem part restates the mathematical expression. So maybe here, the problem part would be \"Show that the product of two consecutive natural numbers is never a square,\" and the assumption is n is a natural number.\n\nWait, but the original problem is \"Show that the product of two consecutive natural numbers is never a square.\" So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The numbers are consecutive natural numbers.\n\nBut since consecutive natural numbers are n and n+1 where n is a natural number, so the assumption would be that n is a natural number. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the product of two consecutive natural numbers, n(n+1), is never a square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the consecutive part is part of the problem statement and not an assumption. But the example given by the user included assumptions that were perhaps not all explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem included assumptions \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" which would mean the assumption is n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That might have been a mistake, but perhaps in that example, the user was demonstrating how to structure even if the problem is modified. However, in the current problem, the original problem is as stated, and we need to structure it correctly.\n\nSo to avoid confusion, in the current problem, the only assumption is that n is a natural number. The problem is to show that n(n+1) is never a square. Therefore, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the product of two consecutive natural numbers, n(n+1), is never a square.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem title is \"Show that the product of two consecutive natural numbers is never a square,\" perhaps the problem statement can be exactly that, and the assumption is that n and n+1 are consecutive natural numbers. But according to the user's example, each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So \"n and n+1 are consecutive natural numbers\" would be one assumption, but maybe splitting into:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. n+1 is the next natural number after n.\n\nBut perhaps that's redundant. Alternatively, since consecutive is a relation between n and n+1, but the user's example listed assumptions about a single object. Therefore, the safest way is to list \"n is a natural number\" as the assumption, and the problem is to show that n(n+1) is never a square.\n\nYes, that's probably correct. The consecutive part is inherent in the problem statement, so the key assumption is that n is natural.",
