    "Content": "A polynomial $p$ over a field $k$ is called irreducible if $p=fg$ for polynomials $f,g$ implies $f$ or $g$ are constant. One can consider the determinant of an $n\\times n$ matrix to be a polynomial in $n^2$ variables. Does anyone know of a slick way to prove this polynomial is irreducible? It feels like this should follow quite easily from basic properties of the determinant or an induction argument, but I cannot think of a nice proof. One consequence of this fact is that $GL_n$ is the complement of a hypersurface in $M_{n}$. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Deonote $p$ the determinant polyonomial. Observing that $p$ is of degree one in $x_{ij}$ for every $(i,j)$ . Now we can prove $p$ is irreducible. Suppose $p=fg$ . Consider $x_{11}$ . Suppose $x_{11}$ appears in $f$ , then $f$ is of degree one in $x_{11}$ and $g$ is of degree zero in $x_{11}$ . Now consider $x_{1j}$ , then $x_{1j}$ must appear in $f$ , otherwise $g$ is of degree one in $x_{1j}$ and $f$ is degree zero in $x_{1j}$ , then the equality $$fg=(ax_{11}+b)(cx_{1j}+d)=acx_{11}x_{1j}+bcx_{1j}+adx_{11}+bd\\in \\mathbb{F}[x_{11}, x_{1j}, \\dots]$$ leads to contradiction. So all $x_{1j}$ in $f$ for $j=1,\\ldots,n$ . Similar $x_{j1}$ are all in $f$ . And since $x_{j1}$ is in $f$ , it follows $x_{jk}$ are in $f$ . Finally, all $x_{ij}$ are in $f$ . And $g$ is a constant. We are done! Edit: Contradiction: view $p$ be a polynomial of $x_{11},x_{1j}$ , then $$p=x_{11}h_1+x_{1j}h_2+h_3\\in \\mathbb{F}[x_{11},x_{1j}, \\dots],$$ where $h_1,h_2,h_3  \\in \\mathbb{F}[\\{x_{ij}\\}\\mid x_{ij}\\neq x_{11},x_{1j}]$ , i.e., they are \"constant\" about $x_{11},x_{1j}$ , but $$fg=acx_{11}x_{1j}+bcx_{1j}+adx_{11}+bd,$$ while $0\\neq ac \\in \\mathbb{F}[\\{x_{ij}\\}\\mid x_{ij}\\neq x_{11},x_{1j}]$ and $bc,ad,bd$ are \"constant\" about $x_{11},x_{1j}$ (all the results come from the assumption $f$ is a polynomial of degree one in $x_{11}$ and of degree zero in $x_{1j}$ and $g$ is of degree one in $x_{1j}$ and of degree zero in $x_{11}$ ), so $p$ cannot equal to $fg$ since the definition of the determinant.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question: The problem is about proving that the determinant, as a polynomial in n² variables, is irreducible. The user mentions that a polynomial is irreducible if it can't be factored into non-constant polynomials. The determinant is considered over a field k.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each condition. The key points here are: the polynomial p is over a field k; the determinant is viewed as a polynomial in n² variables; irreducibility is defined as any factorization requiring one factor to be constant. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property.\n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"A polynomial p over a field k is called irreducible if p=fg implies f or g are constant.\" That's the definition, so that's an assumption. Then, the determinant is an n×n matrix with entries as variables, so the polynomial is in n² variables. Also, the problem is to prove this determinant polynomial is irreducible.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The polynomial p is over a field k.\n- The determinant is considered as a polynomial in n² variables.\n- Irreducibility of p means any factorization p=fg requires f or g to be constant.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove the determinant polynomial is irreducible. The user is asking for a proof of that. The original question doesn't list assumptions but states the problem. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem statement. The problem's assumptions would be the definitions and setup provided.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list each individual condition or property that's given. Let me parse the question again:\n\n\"A polynomial p over a field k is called irreducible if p=fg for polynomials f,g implies f or g are constant. One can consider the determinant of an n×n matrix to be a polynomial in n² variables. Does anyone know of a slick way to prove this polynomial is irreducible?\"\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The polynomial p is over a field k.\n2. The determinant is viewed as a polynomial in n² variables (each entry of the matrix is a variable).\n3. Irreducibility is defined such that any factorization p=fg requires f or g to be constant.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is then to prove that the determinant polynomial is irreducible.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, is the field k assumed to be algebraically closed or not? The original problem doesn't specify, so we can't assume that. The determinant is a polynomial in n² variables over any field k. The irreducibility definition is standard. So those three points should be the assumptions.\n\nNow, the problem statement is: Prove that the determinant polynomial (as an n×n matrix with entries as variables) is irreducible.\n\nLet me structure that.",
