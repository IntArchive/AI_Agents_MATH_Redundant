    "Content": "Knowing that if you have two independent $X$ and $Y$, and $ f $ and $ g $ measurable functions, how to show that then $ U = f (X) $ and $ V = g (Y) $ are still independent.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You said measurable so I am going to assume you want a measure-theoretic answer, and that your definition of independence is $X$ and $Y$ are independent iff $\\sigma(X)$ is independent of $\\sigma(Y)$, i.e. that $P[X \\in B_1, Y \\in B_2] = P[X \\in B_1]P[Y \\in B_2]$ for all borel sets $B_1,B_2$. You must assume $f,g$ are borel functions (this is so that $f(X),g(Y)$ are measurable, so asking the question of independence makes sense). The $\\sigma$-algebra generated by $f(X)$ is a sub-$\\sigma$-algebra of the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by $X$, and similarly for $g(Y)$ and $Y$. To see this note that for any borel set $B$ we have $(f\\circ X)^{-1}(B) = X^{-1}(f^{-1}(B)) = X^{-1}(\\text{some borel set}) \\in \\sigma(X)$. Since $\\sigma(X) \\perp \\sigma(Y)$ it follows that $\\sigma(f(X)) \\perp \\sigma(g(Y))$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that if X and Y are independent random variables, then any measurable functions of them, f(X) and g(Y), are also independent. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So here, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. X and Y are independent random variables. That's the main condition given.\n2. f and g are measurable functions. The problem mentions these functions are measurable, so that's another assumption.\n\nThe problem statement then is to show that U = f(X) and V = g(Y) are independent. \n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is separate. The first assumption is about the independence of X and Y. The second is about the measurability of f and g. Both are necessary for the conclusion. \n\nWait, does the problem specify anything else? The original question says \"knowing that you have two independent X and Y, and f and g measurable functions, how to show...\" So the assumptions are indeed X and Y independent, f and g measurable. Each of these is a separate condition. Then the problem is to show U and V are independent. \n\nI think that's all. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, similarly, two assumptions: independence and measurability. So the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and then the problem statement.",
