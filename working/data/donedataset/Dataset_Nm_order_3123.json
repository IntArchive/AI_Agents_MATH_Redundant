    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is an exercise in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis , if I remember correctly, where it appears with a generous hint. I think the solution alluded to runs as follows. Fix $x\\in\\mathbb R$. For $h>0$, you can expand $f(x+2h)$ via Taylor's theorem:\n$$\nf(x+2h)\n=\nf(x)+f'(x)2h+\\frac{f''(\\xi)}{2!}(2h)^2\n$$\nwhere $\\xi\\in(x,x+2h)$. So\n$$\nf'(x)=\\frac{1}{2h}\\left[f(x+2h)-f(x)\\right]-f''(\\xi)h\n$$\nFrom here you can bound $|f'(x)|$:\n$$\n|f'(x)|\\leq\\frac{1}{2h}|f(x+2h)-f(x)|+|f''(\\xi)|h\\leq\\frac{M_0}{h}+M_2h.\n$$\nSince $x$ is arbitrary, you can replace $|f'(x)|$ with $M_1$. If $M_2=0$, let $h\\to\\infty$ to get $M_1=0$. Otherwise, rearrange to get\n$$\n0\\leq M_2h^2-M_1h+M_0=M_2\\left(h-\\frac{M_1}{2M_2}\\right)^2+\\frac{4M_2M_0-M_1^2}{4M_2}.\n$$\nTake $h=\\frac{M_1}{2M_2}$ to get the inequality.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe problem is about proving an inequality involving the suprema of a function and its first and second derivatives. The function is twice differentiable from ℝ to ℝ. The suprema are defined as M₀, M₁, and M₂ for the function itself, its first derivative, and second derivative, respectively. The goal is to show that M₁ squared is less than or equal to 4 times M₀ times M₂.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, the function f is twice differentiable, so that's an assumption. Then, each M is defined as the supremum of the absolute value of f, its first derivative, and second derivative. Each of these should be separate assumptions. However, in the example given, assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were split. Here, the function's differentiability and the definitions of M0, M1, M2 each can be separate assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might have been an error? Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps that example was a mistake. Hmm, maybe the example was part of a different problem where the user had to include an assumption that was perhaps missing? Wait, perhaps there was a typo in the example.\n\nBut regardless, the task here is to structure the current problem correctly. The original problem states that f is twice differentiable, and defines M0, M1, M2 as the suprema of |f|, |f'|, |f''| respectively. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f: ℝ → ℝ is twice differentiable.\n2. M₀ is the supremum of |f(x)|.\n3. M₁ is the supremum of |f'(x)|.\n4. M₂ is the supremum of |f''(x)|.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that M₁² ≤ 4M₀M₂.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the function other than being twice differentiable, so maybe the suprema are finite? Because if M0, M1, M2 are defined as suprema, it's possible that they could be infinite, but in the context of such inequalities, we usually assume they are finite. However, the original problem doesn't state that explicitly. So perhaps an assumption is that M₀, M₁, M₂ are finite. But since the problem asks to prove M₁² ≤ 4M₀M₂, it's implied that M₀ and M₂ are non-negative, and finite. So should we include that as assumptions?\n\nIn the example given, the user didn't include that the suprema are finite, but maybe that's considered part of the definitions here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the suprema are finite. Since the problem statement defines M0, M1, M2 as the suprema, and asks to prove an inequality involving them, it's reasonable to assume that these suprema are finite; otherwise, the inequality would be trivial or undefined. Therefore, maybe we should include that each supremum is finite. But does the problem state that? The original problem says \"Prove that M₁² ≤ 4M₀M₂\". If, for example, M₂ is zero, but that would make the right-hand side zero, so M₁ would have to be zero as well. But perhaps the problem implicitly assumes that M₀ and M₂ are non-negative, but since they are suprema of absolute values, they are automatically non-negative. So maybe the key assumptions are just the differentiability and the definitions of the suprema. The problem might be intended for functions where these suprema are finite, but that's not stated. However, in the context of such inequalities, it's standard to assume that the suprema are finite unless otherwise specified. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a twice differentiable function from ℝ to ℝ.\n- M₀ is the supremum of |f(x)| over all real x.\n- M₁ is the supremum of |f’(x)| over all real x.\n- M₂ is the supremum of |f''(x)| over all real x.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove the inequality M₁² ≤ 4M₀M₂.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property. Then state the problem.\n\nI need to ensure that the problem is correctly captured. Let me check again the original question:\n\n\"Let f:ℝ→ℝ be a twice differentiable function. And let\n\nM₀ = sup|f(x)|,\n\nM₁ = sup|f’(x)|,\n\nM₂ = sup|f''(x)|.\n\nProve that M₁² ≤ 4M₀M₂.\"\n\nYes, so the assumptions are exactly as I listed. Each part is separate: function's differentiability, then each supremum definition. Therefore, the formatted problem should have four assumptions (twice differentiable, and the three suprema definitions), but wait, the function being twice differentiable is one assumption, and then each of the suprema is another, so total four? Wait, no, the function being twice differentiable is one assumption. Then the definitions of M0, M1, M2 are three separate assumptions. So total four assumptions. But in the example given, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two assumptions. So each condition is a separate line, even if they apply to the same object. Therefore, here, the function being twice differentiable is one assumption. Then each of M0, M1, M2 being defined as suprema of |f|, |f’|, |f''| respectively would be three separate assumptions. Thus, four assumptions in total.\n\nBut wait, the problem defines all three suprema, so each is a separate assumption. So the list would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nf: ℝ → ℝ is twice differentiable.\n\nM₀ is the supremum of |f(x)| over x ∈ ℝ.\n\nM₁ is the supremum of |f’(x)| over x ∈ ℝ.\n\nM₂ is the supremum of |f''(x)| over x ∈ ℝ.\n\nProblem: Prove that M₁² ≤ 4M₀M₂.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is on its own line, addressing one property or condition. The function's differentiability is one, each supremum definition is another. So the formatted problem should look like that.",
