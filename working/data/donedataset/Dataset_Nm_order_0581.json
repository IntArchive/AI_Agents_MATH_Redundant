    "Content": "Came across the following exercise in Bartle 's Elements of Real Analysis . This is the solution I came up with. Would be grateful if someone could verify it for me and maybe suggest better/alternate solutions. I also looked up these related questions - (1) , (2) , (3) - but was not happy with proofs given there. I seem to need some help understanding these. Any such help is appreciated. Show that every sequence in $\\Bbb R$ either has a monotone increasing sub-sequence or a monotone decreasing sub-sequence. Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in $\\Bbb R$. Suppose $(x_n)$ is not bounded. Without loss of generality we may assume that $(x_n)$ is not bounded above. Therefore given any real number there is a member of the sequence which is greater. Let $x_{n_1}$ be any member of the sequence. There is $x_{n_2} \\gt \\sup\\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n_1} \\}$. For $i \\gt 1$ let $x_{n_i} = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n_{i - 1}}\\}$ then $(x_{n_k})$ forms a monotone subsequence of $(x_n)$. Now suppose instead that $(x_n)$ is bounded. By the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem there is a subsequence $(y_n)$ of $(x_n)$ which converges to a limit $y$. Without loss of generality there are infinitely many distinct values in $(y_n)$ that are unequal to $y$. Let $y_{k1}$ be the first such element. Let $y_{k2}$ be any element in $\\{ y' \\in (y_n) \\ \\ | \\ \\ |y' - y | \\lt |y - y_{k1}|  \\}$. For $i \\gt 1$ let $y_{ki} \\in \\{ y' \\in (y_n)  \\ \\ | \\ \\ |y' - y | \\lt |y - y_{k \\ i - 1}|  \\}$. Such $y_{ki}$ exists for every $i \\in  \\Bbb N$ since $ \\lim (y_n) = y $. Now let $(y_{kn})$ be the sub-sequence of $(y_n)$ thus formed. At least one of the two following sets must contain infinitely many elements. $\\{ y \\in (y_{kn}) \\ \\ | \\ \\ y \\gt x\\}$ $\\{ y \\in (y_{kn}) \\ \\ | \\ \\ y \\lt x\\}$ The one which does forms a monotone subsequence.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a very classic argument, I think. Let $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ be called \"nice\" if $a_n >a_m$ for all $m> n$ .  So we have only two possibilities: (1) The sequence contains infinitely many \"nice\" points. If $n_1<n_2<\\ldots<n_i< \\ldots$ are the \"nice\" points, we have $a_{n_1}>a_{n_2}> \\ldots>a_{n_i}> \\ldots$ , so $(a_{n_i})$ is a decreasing subsequence. (2) The sequence contains finitely many \"nice\" points. Let $n_1$ be greater than all the \"nice\" points. Since $n_1$ is not \"nice\" there is some $n_2>n_1$ such that $a_{n_2}\\ge a_{n_1}$ , and we continue in this fashion to get a non-decreasing subsequence $(a_{n_i})$ . More formally: Let $N$ be a natural number which is greater than all the \"nice\" points. We define $n_1:= N$ and $n_{i+1}:=\\min\\{n> n_{i}: a_n\\ge a_{n_{i}}\\}$ . Hence $(a_{n_i})$ is non-decreasing.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that every sequence in R has a monotone subsequence. The user's attempt splits the problem into two cases: when the sequence is unbounded and when it's bounded. For the bounded case, they use Bolzano-Weierstrass to get a convergent subsequence, then try to construct a monotone subsequence from that.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the Assumptions are specific conditions applied to each object. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more general, but there might be implicit assumptions in the user's approach.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the title is \"every sequence in R contains a monotone sub-sequence.\" The user's approach assumes two cases: unbounded and bounded. For the bounded case, they use Bolzano-Weierstrass, which requires the sequence to be bounded. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The sequence is in R.\n2. If the sequence is bounded, then apply Bolzano-Weierstrass.\n3. If the sequence is unbounded, consider whether it's unbounded above or below (but the user only handles unbounded above, assuming WLOG).\n\nBut in the formatting example, assumptions are listed as individual conditions. So for the problem statement, the main assumption is that we're dealing with a sequence in R. The problem is to show that such a sequence has a monotone increasing or decreasing subsequence.\n\nWait, but the example included specific assumptions from the problem. In the original problem, the user might have made some assumptions in their proof attempt, like assuming the sequence is unbounded above, or that there are infinitely many terms not equal to the limit. But when structuring the problem, the task is to filter out the problem's own assumptions, not the user's proof steps.\n\nWait, the example given by the user took the original problem which was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and in the formatted problem, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", so why did the formatted problem include \"n is divisible by 7\"? Wait, that example might have been a mistake. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem states: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem has assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong. Wait, maybe the user made an error in their example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem was different. Wait, maybe the user intended to modify the problem for the example. Hmm, perhaps in their example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's confusing. Wait, maybe the example is illustrative, and not an actual correct structuring. So perhaps the user is showing that in the formatted problem, they list assumptions, even if they are not all present in the original problem. Wait, but in the original problem, the assumption is that n is an integer, but the example adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would change the problem. Maybe the example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. This could be a problem. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem as per the example. So perhaps, for the current problem, I need to look at the problem presented in the Math Stack Exchange question and extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe problem in the Math Stack Exchange question is: \"Show that every sequence in R either has a monotone increasing subsequence or a monotone decreasing subsequence.\" So the main assumption here is that we have a sequence in R. The problem is to prove the existence of a monotone subsequence (either increasing or decreasing).\n\nBut in the example, the user included additional assumptions from the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption. Then in the formatted problem, they list \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But \"n is divisible by 7\" is not in the original problem. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo. But regardless, the user's example shows that the formatted problem includes the assumptions as per the problem's conditions. However, in this current problem, the problem is general: every sequence in R. So the only assumption is that we're dealing with a sequence in R. The problem is to show that such a sequence has a monotone subsequence.\n\nBut wait, the user's own attempt splits the problem into bounded and unbounded cases. However, when structuring the problem, we need to present the problem as stated, not the proof's approach. The user's proof uses assumptions like \"if the sequence is unbounded\", but those are part of the proof strategy, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are just that the sequence is in R. The problem is to show that every such sequence has a monotone subsequence.\n\nBut looking back at the example, even though the original problem was \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect unless the original problem was modified. So perhaps the example is flawed. However, given the user's instruction, I need to follow the format, which includes listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn this case, the problem is \"every sequence in R has a monotone subsequence.\" The only explicit assumption here is that we're dealing with a sequence in R. There are no other conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: The sequence is in R.\n\nProblem: Show that every sequence in R either has a monotone increasing subsequence or a monotone decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are just the general conditions. Wait, but in the example, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\", they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So the assumption here is that the object in question (n) is an integer. Similarly, here, the sequence is in R, so the assumption is that we have a sequence in R.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The sequence is in R.\n\nProblem: Show that every sequence in R either has a monotone increasing subsequence or a monotone decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut wait, the user's example added an extra assumption (\"n is divisible by 7\") which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user intended to include the problem's conditions as assumptions, even if they are given in the problem statement. However, in the original example, the problem states \"for every integer n\", which would make \"n is an integer\" an assumption. The extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" might be a mistake or part of a different problem. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but the instruction is to follow it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, and the correct approach is to extract all assumptions from the problem statement. In the current problem, the problem is about sequences in R, so the only assumption is that we have a sequence in R. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The sequence is in R.\n\nProblem: Show that every sequence in R either has a monotone increasing subsequence or a monotone decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut the user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. Perhaps the example is wrong. Therefore, maybe the user intended to include only the assumptions explicitly given in the problem, not added ones. In that case, for the current problem, the assumption is just that the sequence is in R. But I need to follow the example's structure even if it's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a mistake and the user intended to have the assumptions as given in the problem. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct way is to list the assumptions as per the problem's own conditions. The problem says \"every sequence in R\", so the assumption is that we're dealing with a sequence in R. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The sequence is in R.\n\nProblem: Show that the sequence contains a monotone increasing subsequence or a monotone decreasing subsequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions include more, but in the problem statement, there are no other conditions. The user's proof splits into cases (bounded/unbounded), but those are part of the proof, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the correct formatted problem would have only the assumption that the sequence is in R.",
