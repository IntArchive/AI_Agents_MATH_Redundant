    "Content": "I am to show the continuity of this function with the help of $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$ argument. The function is: $g: \\Bbb{R} \\rightarrow \\Bbb{R}$, $x \\mapsto x^2$. Given the $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$ definition of limit, I tried as follows: We must have: $|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\\epsilon$, so then $|x^2-x_0^2|=|(x-x_0)(x+x_0)|=|(x-x_0)||(x+x_0)|$, so $|x-x_0|<\\frac{\\epsilon}{|x+x_0|}$. So now I will choose $\\delta=\\frac{\\epsilon}{|x+x_0|}$. Is it enough? I am writing this sentences like a machine, but I am not understanding intuitively.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No. $\\delta$ must only depend on $x_0,\\epsilon$ and never on $x$. Here is what we will do: The problematic term is $\\left|x+x_0\\right|$. We have that \n\\begin{equation} \\left|x+x_0\\right|= \\left|x-x_0+2x_0\\right|\\le \\left|x-x_0\\right|+\\left|2x_0\\right|<\\delta+2\\left|x_0\\right|\\end{equation}\nThus, \n\\begin{equation}\\left|x-x_0\\right|<\\delta\\implies \\left|f(x)-f(x_0)\\right|=\\left|x+x_0\\right|\\left|x-x_0\\right|<(\\delta+2\\left|x_0\\right|)\\delta\\end{equation}\nWe must choose a $\\delta$ so that\n$$(\\delta+2\\left|x_0\\right|)\\delta<\\epsilon$$\nChoosing a $\\delta$ by the above might be complicating. But because $\\delta$ is ours to choose we can simplify things a bit by demanding $\\delta<1$. Then,\n$$(\\delta+2\\left|x_0\\right|)\\delta<(1+2\\left|x_0\\right|)\\delta$$\nand so it suffices to choose $0<\\delta<1$ so that\n$$(1+2\\left|x_0\\right|)\\delta<\\epsilon$$\nThings should be straighforward now. For the sake of completion we have \n$$(1+2\\left|x_0\\right|)\\delta<\\epsilon\\iff \\delta<\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+2\\left|x_0\\right|}$$\nBut because $\\delta<1$ we must choose $\\delta>0$ so that\n$$\\delta<\\min\\left\\{1,\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+2\\left|x_0\\right|}\\right\\}$$\nTaking \n$$\\delta=\\frac12\\min\\left\\{1,\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+2\\left|x_0\\right|}\\right\\}$$\ncompletes the proof",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the function g(x) = x² is continuous using the epsilon-delta definition. They mentioned starting with the requirement that |f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε, which translates to |x² - x₀²|. They factored it as |(x - x₀)(x + x₀)|, which becomes |x - x₀| * |x + x₀|. Then they tried setting delta to ε divided by |x + x₀|. But they're unsure if this is sufficient. \n\nHmm, I remember that when using epsilon-delta proofs, delta needs to depend only on epsilon and x₀, not on x itself. Because x is approaching x₀, so x is variable here. If delta is set to ε/|x + x₀|, then delta would depend on x, which isn't allowed. That's probably the mistake here. \n\nSo, how do we handle the |x + x₀| term? We need to bound this term somehow. Since x is approaching x₀, we can restrict delta to be less than some value, say 1, to keep x close enough to x₀. If we let delta ≤ 1, then |x - x₀| < 1 implies that x is within (x₀ - 1, x₀ + 1). Therefore, |x + x₀| = |x - x₀ + 2x₀| ≤ |x - x₀| + |2x₀| < 1 + 2|x₀|. \n\nNow we have |x + x₀| < 1 + 2|x₀|. So, |x - x₀| * |x + x₀| < delta * (1 + 2|x₀|). To make this less than epsilon, we set delta to be the minimum of 1 and epsilon / (1 + 2|x₀|). This way, delta doesn't depend on x, only on epsilon and x₀. \n\nLet me check if that works. Suppose delta is min(1, ε/(1 + 2|x₀|)). Then if |x - x₀| < delta, we have two cases: delta is either 1 or ε/(1 + 2|x₀|). If delta is 1, then |x + x₀| < 1 + 2|x₀|, so |x² - x₀²| < delta * (1 + 2|x₀|) = 1 * (1 + 2|x₀|). But we need this to be less than epsilon. Wait, but if delta is the minimum of 1 and ε/(...), then in that case, even if delta is 1, we need to ensure that 1 * (1 + 2|x₀|) ≤ ε. But that's not necessarily true. So maybe the choice of delta needs to be the minimum of 1 and epsilon divided by (1 + 2|x₀|). Then, when delta is the smaller one, we can ensure that delta * (1 + 2|x₀|) ≤ epsilon. \n\nYes, because if delta is ε/(1 + 2|x₀|), then multiplying by (1 + 2|x₀|) gives epsilon. If delta is 1, but in that case, we also have delta <= epsilon/(1 + 2|x₀|) only if 1 <= epsilon/(...). But to cover all cases, taking the minimum ensures that delta is small enough so that delta*(1 + 2|x₀|) <= epsilon. \n\nTherefore, the correct delta should be delta = min(1, ε/(1 + 2|x₀|)). This way, regardless of which value is smaller, we satisfy both conditions. That makes sense. \n\nSo the initial approach of the user was incorrect because delta depended on x, but by bounding |x + x₀| and choosing delta appropriately, we can make it depend only on epsilon and x₀. This should be the right way to structure the proof.",
