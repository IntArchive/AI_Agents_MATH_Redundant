    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that for a positive definite matrix B, the quadratic form V(x) = x^T B x is bounded by the minimum and maximum eigenvalues times the squared Euclidean norm of x. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the properties of positive definite matrices. A positive definite matrix B has all its eigenvalues positive. So, λ_min and λ_max here are the smallest and largest eigenvalues of B, respectively. Since B is positive definite, all eigenvalues are positive, so the absolute values mentioned in the definitions of λ_min and λ_max are redundant, but maybe included for emphasis.\n\nThe problem statement mentions that V(x) is between λ_min ||x||² and λ_max ||x||². This reminds me of the Rayleigh quotient, which for a symmetric matrix B is defined as R(x) = (x^T B x)/(x^T x). The Rayleigh-Ritz theorem states that the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of B are the minimum and maximum values of R(x) over all non-zero x. \n\nSo, applying that theorem, we have λ_min ≤ R(x) ≤ λ_max for all x ≠ 0. Multiplying through by ||x||² (which is x^T x), we get exactly the inequality needed: λ_min ||x||² ≤ x^T B x ≤ λ_max ||x||². \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that B is positive definite, which is crucial because it ensures all eigenvalues are positive, and the Rayleigh quotient applies to symmetric matrices. However, positive definite matrices are usually considered in the context of real symmetric or Hermitian matrices. Is the user assuming B is symmetric? The definition of positive definite given here only requires that x^T B x > 0 for all non-zero x, but in some contexts, positive definite matrices are by definition symmetric. However, in linear algebra, especially in quadratic forms, even if B is not symmetric, the quadratic form x^T B x can be rewritten using the symmetric part of B, (B + B^T)/2. But since the problem mentions eigenvalues, which for non-symmetric matrices can be complex, but here they are taking absolute values, maybe there's a confusion. \n\nWait, the problem defines λ_min as the minimum of the absolute values of eigenvalues, but since B is positive definite, if it's symmetric, all eigenvalues are positive, so absolute value isn't necessary. However, if B is not symmetric, eigenvalues could be complex. But the standard definition of positive definite usually requires the matrix to be symmetric (in real case) or Hermitian (in complex case). So perhaps the problem assumes B is symmetric. That should be an assumption. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe original question says: \"positive definite matrix B, that is, V(x) = x^T B x > 0 for any vector x ≠ 0.\" So their definition is just x^T B x > 0. In some textbooks, positive definite matrices are required to be symmetric, but in others, it's defined without symmetry. However, when dealing with eigenvalues, if B isn't symmetric, the eigenvalues might not be real. But since they are taking absolute values of eigenvalues, maybe B is allowed to be non-symmetric but still with real eigenvalues? This is a bit confusing. \n\nBut given that the user defines λ_min and λ_max as the min and max of the absolute values of eigenvalues, it's possible that B could have complex eigenvalues. However, for a quadratic form x^T B x to be real for all real vectors x, B must be symmetric. Because if B is not symmetric, x^T B x is not necessarily equal to x^T B^T x, so the quadratic form would be x^T (B + B^T)/2 x. Therefore, to ensure that x^T B x is real and positive for all real x, B must be symmetric (or at least its symmetric part must be positive definite). \n\nBut the problem statement does not explicitly state that B is symmetric. However, since they are talking about eigenvalues and positive definiteness, perhaps the standard assumption is that B is symmetric. Therefore, in the assumptions, we need to include that B is a symmetric positive definite matrix. But according to the user's original problem, the only assumption given is that B is positive definite (as per their definition). So maybe the problem as posed does not assume symmetry. This could be an oversight. \n\nBut in the context of quadratic forms, the matrix is usually taken to be symmetric. However, the problem's definitions of λ_min and λ_max involve eigenvalues. If B is not symmetric, eigenvalues could be complex, and taking their absolute values would make sense. But the quadratic form x^T B x being positive for all x ≠ 0 doesn't necessarily require eigenvalues to be positive. For example, a non-symmetric matrix could have complex eigenvalues but still satisfy x^T B x > 0 for all real x. However, this is more complicated. \n\nGiven that the user wants to prove the inequality involving eigenvalues, the standard approach would be to assume that B is symmetric. Therefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. B is a real symmetric matrix. (Because eigenvalues are real for symmetric matrices)\n2. B is positive definite, i.e., x^T B x > 0 for all x ≠ 0.\n3. λ_min is the smallest eigenvalue of B.\n4. λ_max is the largest eigenvalue of B.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user defines λ_min and λ_max as the min and max of the absolute values of eigenvalues. However, if B is symmetric positive definite, all eigenvalues are positive, so |λ| = λ. Therefore, their definitions of λ_min and λ_max are equivalent to just the min and max eigenvalues. So in that case, the absolute value is redundant. But if B is not symmetric, the eigenvalues could be complex, and taking absolute values makes sense. But given that x^T B x is real and positive, perhaps even if B is not symmetric, the eigenvalues have positive real parts? I'm not sure. This is getting too complicated. \n\nSince the problem is about quadratic forms and eigenvalues, the standard approach assumes B is symmetric. Therefore, the assumptions should include that B is symmetric. But in the original problem, the user only states that B is positive definite via the quadratic form. So perhaps the user is not assuming symmetry. However, the Rayleigh quotient approach requires symmetry for the eigenvalues to be real and the min-max theorem to hold. \n\nThis is a bit of a conflict. The problem as stated by the user might have a missing assumption, namely that B is symmetric. But since the user didn't state that, should we include it in the assumptions? Or is it implied by the definition of positive definite? \n\nIn many contexts, positive definite matrices are assumed to be symmetric. For example, in Boyd's Convex Optimization, a positive definite matrix is symmetric. However, in some other contexts, like in engineering, sometimes people don't assume symmetry. \n\nBut since the user is using eigenvalues and absolute values, and given that the quadratic form is real, the matrix must be symmetric. Because if B is not symmetric, the quadratic form x^T B x can still be positive, but the eigenvalues might not capture the behavior of the quadratic form. For example, consider a non-symmetric matrix with a positive definite symmetric part. The eigenvalues could be complex, but the quadratic form is still positive. \n\nHowever, the Rayleigh quotient applies to symmetric matrices. Therefore, the inequality the user wants to prove is a standard result for symmetric positive definite matrices. Therefore, the assumption missing here is that B is symmetric. But the original problem doesn't state that. \n\nBut since we are to list assumptions based on the problem, the original problem only states that B is positive definite (via the quadratic form), and defines λ_min and λ_max as min and max of absolute eigenvalues. So the assumptions we need to list are:\n\n- B is a positive definite matrix (x^T B x > 0 for any x ≠ 0)\n- λ_min is the minimum absolute value of eigenvalues of B\n- λ_max is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues of B\n\nBut if B is not symmetric, the eigenvalues could be complex, so taking their absolute values makes sense. However, for the quadratic form inequality, even if B is not symmetric, we can relate it to its symmetric part. But the problem is likely assuming B is symmetric, given the context. But since the user didn't specify, we can't assume that. \n\nHowever, the key here is that the quadratic form x^T B x can be related to the eigenvalues of B if B is diagonalizable. But without symmetry, B might not be diagonalizable. This is getting too complicated. \n\nBut the standard proof for this inequality uses the fact that for a symmetric matrix, you can diagonalize it and express x in the eigenbasis, then the quadratic form becomes a sum of eigenvalues times the squares of the coordinates. Then, replacing each eigenvalue by the min or max gives the bounds. \n\nTherefore, the assumption needed is that B is symmetric. But since the user didn't specify that, but defined positive definiteness via the quadratic form, there's a missing assumption here. \n\nHowever, since the user is asking for help and probably following a standard textbook where positive definite implies symmetric, we can include that assumption. But according to the problem as presented, the user only gives that B is positive definite (quadratic form), and defines λ_min and λ_max as min and max of absolute eigenvalues. \n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- B is a positive definite matrix (x^T B x > 0 for any x ≠ 0)\n- λ_min is the minimum of the absolute values of eigenvalues of B\n- λ_max is the maximum of the absolute values of eigenvalues of B\n\nBut the problem is to show the inequality. The key step is using the Rayleigh quotient and the fact that the quadratic form is bounded by the eigenvalues. Therefore, the answer would involve noting that B can be diagonalized (if symmetric), or if not, perhaps using the singular values? Wait, but singular values are related to the singular value decomposition, not eigenvalues. \n\nAlternatively, even if B is not symmetric, but since x^T B x is a real number, we can write x^T B x = x^T ( (B + B^T)/2 ) x, where (B + B^T)/2 is symmetric. Then, the quadratic form is equivalent to that of the symmetric part of B. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the symmetric part (which are real) can be used. However, the problem defines λ_min and λ_max in terms of the eigenvalues of B, not its symmetric part. \n\nThis seems like a potential inconsistency. Therefore, the correct path here is to assume that B is symmetric. Therefore, in the assumptions, we need to include that B is symmetric. But since the original problem doesn't state that, perhaps the user is mistaken, but we should follow their problem as stated. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"positive definite matrix B, that is, V(x) = x^T B x > 0 for any vector x ≠ 0.\" In many contexts, this is the definition of positive definite without requiring symmetry. However, when they talk about eigenvalues, they might need to consider the symmetric part. \n\nBut since the problem is about eigenvalues of B, and the user defines λ_min and λ_max based on the eigenvalues of B (taking absolute values), then even if B is not symmetric, they are considering its eigenvalues. However, for a non-symmetric B, the quadratic form x^T B x is not necessarily related to the eigenvalues of B. For example, B could have complex eigenvalues, but x^T B x is real. \n\nThis is getting too complicated, and the user is probably expecting a standard proof assuming B is symmetric. Therefore, the assumption should include that B is symmetric. However, the original problem does not state this. \n\nBut since the task is to structure the problem as per the given example, which filtered the original problem to list assumptions line by line. The original problem states:\n\n- B is positive definite: V(x) = x^T B x > 0 for any x ≠ 0\n- λ_min is min{|λ| : λ is eigenvalue of B}\n- λ_max is max{|λ| : λ is eigenvalue of B}\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- B is a positive definite matrix\n- For any vector x ≠ 0, V(x) = x^T B x > 0\n- λ_min is the minimum absolute eigenvalue of B\n- λ_max is the maximum absolute eigenvalue of B\n\nWait, but \"positive definite matrix\" is defined by the condition V(x) > 0, so maybe those two are the same. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nB is a positive definite matrix (i.e., V(x) = x^T B x > 0 for any x ≠ 0),\nλ_min is the minimum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of B,\nλ_max is the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of B.\n\nBut since the problem is to show that λ_min ||x||² ≤ V(x) ≤ λ_max ||x||², the key assumptions are the positive definiteness (which in some definitions includes symmetry) and the definitions of λ_min and λ_max. However, without symmetry, the proof approach is different. \n\nBut given the standard approach, and that the problem is likely intended for a symmetric matrix, but the user hasn't specified, we have to list the assumptions as per the original problem. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- B is a positive definite matrix (i.e., V(x) = x^T B x > 0 for any x ≠ 0)\n- λ_min is the minimum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of B\n- λ_max is the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of B\n\nBut the problem is to show the inequality. The standard proof for symmetric matrices uses the fact that B can be diagonalized with an orthogonal matrix, and then express x in terms of the eigenvectors. \n\nBut if B is not symmetric, this approach doesn't work. So maybe the problem implicitly assumes symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, since B is positive definite and symmetric, then the eigenvalues are positive, and the Rayleigh quotient gives the result. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\n- B is a symmetric positive definite matrix\n- λ_min is the smallest eigenvalue of B\n- λ_max is the largest eigenvalue of B\n\nBut the original problem defines λ_min and λ_max as the min and max of absolute eigenvalues, which would be redundant if eigenvalues are positive. \n\nHowever, the user explicitly defines λ_min and λ_max as min and max of absolute eigenvalues, so even if B had negative eigenvalues (which it can't since it's positive definite), but since B is positive definite, all eigenvalues are positive, so absolute values are unnecessary. Therefore, the definitions in the problem are equivalent to λ_min being the smallest eigenvalue and λ_max being the largest. \n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- B is a positive definite matrix (x^T B x > 0 for any x ≠ 0)\n- B has real eigenvalues (implied by positive definite if symmetric)\n- λ_min is the smallest eigenvalue of B\n- λ_max is the largest eigenvalue of B\n\nBut again, if B is not symmetric, eigenvalues could be complex. So to ensure real eigenvalues, B must be symmetric. \n\nBut the problem as stated by the user does not mention symmetry, so perhaps we need to include that as an assumption? But the user didn't state it. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Since the user is asking for help, and the standard result requires symmetry, but the problem as stated doesn't include it, we have to make a judgment. \n\nLooking back at the example provided in the original task, the assistant structured the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem listed each separately. \n\nIn this case, the original problem states that B is positive definite (defined via quadratic form), and defines λ_min and λ_max. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- B is a positive definite matrix (V(x) = x^T B x > 0 for any x ≠ 0)\n- λ_min is the minimum absolute eigenvalue of B\n- λ_max is the maximum absolute eigenvalue of B\n\nBut to connect eigenvalues to the quadratic form, the matrix needs to be diagonalizable, which for real matrices is ensured if it's symmetric. However, the problem doesn't state that. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is correct as stated, and we can proceed without assuming symmetry. In that case, even if B is not symmetric, the quadratic form V(x) = x^T B x can be related to the eigenvalues of the symmetric part (B + B^T)/2, but the problem refers to eigenvalues of B. \n\nThis is getting too deep. Since the user is likely following a standard text where positive definite implies symmetric, but the problem as written does not state it, the assistant should structure the problem based on what is given. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions:\n\nAssumption: \nB is a positive definite matrix (i.e., V(x) = x^T B x > 0 for any x ≠ 0),\nλ_min is the minimum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of B,\nλ_max is the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of B.\n\nProblem: Show that for any x ≠ 0, λ_min ‖x‖₂² ≤ V(x) ≤ λ_max ‖x‖₂².\n\nBut the question is, in the original problem, the user defines λ_min and λ_max with absolute values, but for a positive definite matrix (even non-symmetric), eigenvalues might have positive real parts. However, the quadratic form is real, so eigenvalues might come in complex conjugate pairs. But taking their absolute values makes sense. However, the relation between eigenvalues and the quadratic form is unclear if the matrix is not symmetric. \n\nBut the problem is likely intended for symmetric matrices, so even though the user didn't state it, it's an implicit assumption. Therefore, to make the problem solvable, we should include that B is symmetric. But since the user didn't say that, should we add it? The task is to structure the problem based on the original question, filtering unrelated info. The original question mentions that B is positive definite via the quadratic form, and defines λ_min and λ_max based on eigenvalues. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct formatted problem is as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nB is a positive definite matrix,\nFor any eigenvalue λ of B, |λ| is considered,\nλ_min is the minimum |λ| among eigenvalues of B,\nλ_max is the maximum |λ| among eigenvalues of B.\n\nProblem: Show that λ_min ‖x‖₂² ≤ x^T B x ≤ λ_max ‖x‖₂² for any x ≠ 0.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Since B is positive definite, all eigenvalues are positive (if symmetric), but if not symmetric, eigenvalues could have positive real parts. However, taking absolute values would consider their magnitude. \n\nBut given that the problem is about quadratic forms and eigenvalues, the key assumption is that B is symmetric. Therefore, the assistant might need to infer that B is symmetric. However, since the original problem didn't state that, it's risky. \n\nIn conclusion, following the original problem strictly, the assumptions are:\n\n- B is positive definite (quadratic form > 0)\n- λ_min and λ_max are defined as min and max of |λ| for eigenvalues of B\n\nBut for the inequality to hold, B must be symmetric. However, since the user didn't specify, but in the context of quadratic forms and eigenvalues, it's a standard assumption. \n\nBut according to the task, the assistant is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The original problem didn't mention symmetry, so we can't include it. Therefore, the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nB is a positive definite matrix,\nλ_min is the minimum |λ| among eigenvalues of B,\nλ_max is the maximum |λ| among eigenvalues of B.\n\nProblem: Show that for any x ≠ 0, λ_min ‖x‖₂² ≤ x^T B x ≤ λ_max ‖x‖₂².\n\nEven though, mathematically, this requires B to be symmetric. But the user didn't state that, so we can't assume it. Therefore, the answer must proceed as per the given problem.",
