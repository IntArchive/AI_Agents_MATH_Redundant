    "Content": "How do you show, that for every bound $\\epsilon$, there is a non-zero probability that the motion is bounded on a finite interval.\ni.e. $$\\mathbb{P} (\\sup_{t\\in[0,1]} |B(t)| < \\epsilon) > 0$$ I tried using the reflection principle, I can show that if B* is the motion reflected on the hitting time with the bound, $\\tau$, then I think that\n$$P(\\sup_{t\\in[0,1]} |B(t)| > \\epsilon) = P(|B(1)| > \\epsilon) + P(|B*(1)| > \\epsilon) - P(\\tau < 1, |B(1)-B(\\tau)| > 2\\epsilon)$$\nHowever, I have no idea how to bound the third term (in a useful way, which would show that this probability is non-one)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's three different methods of showing that $\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{t\\in[0,1]}\\vert B_t\\vert < \\epsilon)$ is nonzero. A simple argument based on intuition. You can break the unit interval into a lot of small time steps and, by continuity, the Brownian motion will not move much across each of these steps. By independence of the increments, there is a positive (but small) probability that they largely cancel out, so $B$ stays within $\\epsilon$ of the origin. To make this precise, choose a positive integer $n$ such that $q\\equiv\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{t\\le1/n}\\vert B_t\\vert < \\epsilon/2)$ is nonzero ($q$ can be made as close to 1 as you like, by taking $n$ large). By symmetry, the event $\\{\\sup_{t\\le1/n}\\vert B_t\\vert < \\epsilon/2,\\ B_{1/n}>0\\}$ has probability $q/2$. Note that, if $\\sup_{t\\in[k/n,(k+1)/n]}\\vert B_t-B_{k/n}\\vert < \\epsilon/2$ and $B_{(k+1)/n}-B_{k/n}$ has the opposite sign to $B_{k/n}$ for each $k=0,1,\\ldots,n-1$ then $\\vert B_t\\vert$ will be bounded by $\\epsilon/2$ at the times $k/n$ and, therefore, $\\sup_{t\\le1}\\vert B_t\\vert$ will be less than $\\epsilon$. So, $\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{t\\le1}\\vert B_t\\vert < \\epsilon)\\ge(q/2)^n$. Use a cunning trick. If $X,Y$ are independent Brownian motions over the interval $[0,1]$, then $B=(X-Y)/\\sqrt{2}$ is also a Brownian motion. The sample paths of $X,Y,B$ can be considered as lying in the (complete, separable) metric space $C([0,1])$ of continuous functions $[0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ under the supremum norm . By separability, $C([0,1])$ can be covered by countably many open balls of radius $\\epsilon/\\sqrt{2}$. So, by countable additivity of the probability measure, there exists at least one such ball containing $X$ with probability $q > 0$. By independence, $X,Y$ are both contained in this ball with probability $q^2 > 0$, in which case $\\Vert B\\Vert_\\infty=\\Vert X- Y\\Vert_\\infty/\\sqrt{2}<\\epsilon$. Exact calculation. You can calculate an exact expression for the probability, as an infinite sum, and verify that it is dominated by a single positive term as $\\epsilon$ goes to zero. This is not as simple as the intuitive argument I gave above, but has the advantage that it also gives an accurate asymptotic expression for the probability, which goes to zero like $e^{-\\pi^2/(8\\epsilon^2)}$ as $\\epsilon\\to0$ (this is positive, but tends to zero very quickly). The probability can be calculated using the reflection principal (also see my comments and Douglas Zare's answer to this question ). Writing $p(x)=(2\\pi)^{-1/2}e^{-x^2/2}$ for the probability density function of $B_1$ and $f(x)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty(-1)^n1_{\\{(2n-1)\\epsilon < x < (2n+1)\\epsilon\\}}$ (which is a kind of square wave function),\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{t\\le1}\\vert B_t\\vert < \\epsilon\\right)=\\mathbb{E}[f(B_1)]=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)p(x)\\,dx.\\qquad{\\rm(1)}\n$$\nThis expression comes from the reflection principle, which says that reflecting $B$ after it first hits $\\pm\\epsilon$ gives another Brownian motion. That is, $\\hat B_t\\equiv B_t+1_{\\{t\\ge T\\}}2(B_T-B_t)$ is a Brownian motion, where $T$ is the first time at which $\\vert B_T\\vert=\\epsilon$. As $f$ is antisymmetric about both $\\epsilon$ and $-\\epsilon$, the sum $f(B_1)+f(\\hat B_1)$ vanishes whenever $T\\le1$. So, $1_{\\{T > 1\\}}=(f(B_1)+f(\\hat B_1))/2$, and taking the expectation gives (1). You can perform the integral in (1) directly to express the probability as an infinite sum over the cumulative normal distribution function, but this is not so good in the limit where $\\epsilon$ is small, as you don't have a single dominant term. Alternatively, the integral in (1) can be written as $\\int_{-\\epsilon}^\\epsilon\\theta(x)\\,dx$ where $\\theta(x)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty(-1)^np(x+2n\\epsilon)$. As $\\theta$ has period $4\\epsilon$ you can write it as a Fourier series, and working out the coefficients gives\n$$\n\\theta(x)=\\epsilon^{-1}\\sum_{\\substack{n > 0,\\\\n{\\rm\\ odd}}}\\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{2\\epsilon}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{8\\epsilon^2}\\right).\n$$\nThis is a very fast converging sum, especially for small $\\epsilon$ (the terms vanish much faster then exponentially in $n$). Actually, $\\theta$ is a theta function and the fourier transform is the same thing as the Jacobi identity . Integrating it term by term gives\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{t\\le1}\\vert B_t\\vert < \\epsilon\\right)=\\sum_{\\substack{n > 0,\\\\ n{\\rm\\ odd}}}\\frac{4}{n\\pi}(-1)^{(n-1)/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{8\\epsilon^2}\\right)\n$$\nAs the first term goes to zero much more slowly than the sum of the remaining terms (as $\\epsilon\\to0$) this gives the asymptotic expression\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{t\\le1}\\vert B_t\\vert < \\epsilon\\right)\\sim\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2}{8\\epsilon^2}\\right).\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem as per the required format. The user provided an example, so I need to follow that closely. \n\nFirst, the original question is about showing that for every bound ε, there's a non-zero probability that Brownian motion is bounded on the interval [0,1]. The mathematical expression given is P(sup_{t in [0,1]} |B(t)| < ε) > 0. The user mentions using the reflection principle and some expression involving probabilities, but they're stuck on handling the third term.\n\nLooking at the example, the Assumptions section lists each condition line by line, each applying to one object. The problem statement is then restructured concisely. \n\nSo, for this problem, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about Brownian motion. The main assumptions here would be:\n\n1. B(t) is a Brownian motion. That's a key assumption because the properties of Brownian motion are essential here.\n2. The interval considered is [0,1]. The problem specifies the finite interval as [0,1], so that's an assumption on the domain of t.\n3. ε is a positive bound. The problem states \"for every bound ε\", which implies ε > 0.\n4. The probability is about the supremum of |B(t)| being less than ε over [0,1]. So the event considered is sup_{t∈[0,1]} |B(t)| < ε.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is more about the properties of Brownian motion and the interval. The key conditions here are the definition of Brownian motion, the interval [0,1], and ε being a positive bound. \n\nWait, but the problem statement in the example includes the divisibility condition as an assumption. But in the original problem here, the user is trying to prove the probability is positive for any ε. The assumptions would be the underlying conditions required. However, since the problem is about Brownian motion in general, the main assumption is that B(t) is a Brownian motion. The other conditions are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. Wait, maybe I need to parse this carefully.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem is to show that for every ε>0, the probability that the supremum is less than ε is positive. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. B(t) is a Brownian motion. (This is the main object, so it's an assumption of the problem setup.)\n2. ε is a positive real number. (Because the problem states \"for every bound ε\", which is given as a condition.)\n3. The interval considered is [0,1]. (The problem specifies the finite interval [0,1].)\n\nThe problem then is to show that the probability P(sup... < ε) is greater than zero. So the assumptions are the existence of Brownian motion, ε being positive, and the interval [0,1]. Each of these is a separate line in the Assumption section.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nB(t) is a Brownian motion,\nε is a positive real number,\nthe interval is [0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\mathbb{P} \\left( \\sup_{t\\in[0,1]} |B(t)| < \\epsilon \\right) > 0.$$\n\nThat seems to capture the necessary parts. The reflection principle and the user's attempt might not be part of the assumptions but their approach. The original problem doesn't state any additional constraints beyond the existence of Brownian motion, the interval, and ε being positive. So that's how it should be structured.",
