    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hints: Let $R$ be a Dedekind domain, and let $I\\subseteq R$ be any ideal. Factor $I$ as $\\mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1}\\cdots\\mathfrak{p}_n^{e_n}$. Take ANY $\\alpha\\in I-\\{0\\}$ and factor $(\\alpha)$ as $\\mathfrak{p}_1^{f_1}\\cdots\\mathfrak{p}_n^{f_n}\\mathfrak{q}_1^{g_1}\\cdots\\mathfrak{q}_m^{g_m}$. We know that $f_i\\geqslant e_i$ since $(\\alpha)\\subseteq I$ so that $I\\mid (\\alpha)$. Now explain why there exists some $\\beta\\in R$ such that $v_{\\mathfrak{p}_i}(\\beta)=e_i$ and $v_{\\mathfrak{q}_i}(\\beta)=0$. Explain then why $$(\\alpha,\\beta)=\\text{gcd}((\\alpha),(\\beta))=\\mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1}\\cdots\\mathfrak{p}_n^{e_n}=I$$ This, in fact, shows that for any $I$ and any $\\alpha\\in I-\\{0\\}$ you can always find a complementary generator.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that in a Dedekind domain, every ideal is either principal or generated by two elements. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The key here is to break down each assumption into single properties or conditions applied to one object. The main object here is a Dedekind domain. The properties of a Dedekind domain include being a Noetherian, integrally closed integral domain where every nonzero prime ideal is maximal. However, the problem statement doesn't mention these properties explicitly; it just states \"in a Dedekind domain.\" So the primary assumption is that the ring in question is a Dedekind domain. \n\nThe problem is to prove that every ideal in this domain is either principal or generated by two elements. The example provided in the user's instruction had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That example included two separate assumptions, each on a different line. In this case, the Dedekind domain itself is the main assumption.\n\nWait, but does the problem have any other implicit assumptions? The question doesn't specify any additional conditions like the ideal being nonzero or something else. The example given by the user added an assumption even if the original problem didn't mention it. Wait, looking back, the original example had \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, maybe the user wants to capture all conditions, even if they are part of the universal quantifier. But in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and then added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. Wait, that example might not be accurate. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem under assumptions says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. The original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption. That might have been a mistake in the example. Hmm, maybe the user intended that the example's formatted problem actually didn't include \"n is divisible by 7\", but perhaps it was an error. Or maybe the example was for a different problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That might have been a mistake in the example. \n\nBut perhaps the user intended that the example is correct. If so, then maybe in that case, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" because maybe the user made an error. Alternatively, perhaps the original example's problem had a different original question. Wait, perhaps the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem would correctly list those assumptions. But in the user's example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the additional assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" is incorrect. That suggests that maybe the user's example is flawed, but perhaps they want us to extract assumptions from the problem, even if they are part of the universal quantifier. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question is about a Dedekind domain. The problem is to prove that every ideal is either principal or generated by two elements. The key assumption here is that we're working within a Dedekind domain. So the assumption should be that the ring is a Dedekind domain. Are there any other assumptions? The problem says \"every ideal\", so maybe the assumption is that the ideal is a nonzero ideal? Because in some contexts, the zero ideal is considered, but in Dedekind domains, often we talk about nonzero ideals. However, the problem statement doesn't specify. The original question just says \"every ideal\", so perhaps the zero ideal is included. But in Dedekind domains, the zero ideal is a special case. However, the zero ideal is principal (generated by 0), so maybe the statement still holds. Therefore, the only assumption is that the ring is a Dedekind domain. \n\nBut the example's formatted problem added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, but in this case, we need to stick to the given problem. The problem here is \"Prove that in a Dedekind domain every ideal is either principal or generated by two elements.\" So the assumption is that the ring is a Dedekind domain. The problem is to prove that every ideal in it is either principal or generated by two elements. \n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The ring is a Dedekind domain.\n\nProblem: Prove that every ideal in the ring is either principal or generated by two elements.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, \"the ring is a Dedekind domain\" is a single assumption. There's no other assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The ring is a Dedekind domain.\n\nProblem: Prove that every ideal in the ring is either principal or generated by two elements.\n\nBut maybe the user expects each property of Dedekind domain to be listed? For example, being Noetherian, integrally closed, etc. But the original problem statement doesn't list those; it just says \"Dedekind domain\". So the assumption is that it's a Dedekind domain, which encompasses all those properties. Therefore, the user's example just took \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem said \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, here the assumption is the ring is a Dedekind domain. The problem is the rest. \n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is as above.",
