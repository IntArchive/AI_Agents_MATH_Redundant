It happens that $v=u$ fits the bill. To see why, note that $\\cos(2t)+1=2\\cos^2(t)$ hence $|u_n|\\leqslant u$ for every $n$ as soon as, for every $x$ in $(0,\\pi/2)$, $\\cos(x)\\leqslant\\mathrm e^{-x^2/2}$. Any idea to show this last (classical) inequality?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition line by line, addressing one property per line. The problem statement is then stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem on Math Stack Exchange: the title is about estimating an integral involving a sequence defined as a_n = sqrt(n) times the integral from 0 to pi of ((1 + cos t)/2)^n dt. The user is asking to show that this sequence converges to a real number a > 0.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem defines the sequence {a_n} with a specific integral. The assumptions here would be the conditions given in the problem. Let me check:\n\n1. The sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = sqrt(n) * integral from 0 to pi of [(1 + cos t)/2]^n dt.\n2. The exercise requires showing convergence to a real number a where a > 0.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions were about the properties of the objects involved, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem defines a_n with that integral and the task is to prove convergence to a positive real number. So the assumptions would be the definitions given. Each line should address one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo for the assumption section:\n\n- The sequence {a_n} is defined as a_n = √n * ∫₀^π [(1 + cos t)/2]^n dt.\n- The problem requires showing that {a_n} converges to a real number a.\n- The problem requires showing that a > 0.\n\nBut wait, the example had separate lines for each assumption. Maybe each part of the definition counts as an assumption? Let me look again. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, the problem defines a_n in a specific way, and the task is to show convergence to a positive real number. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = √n * ∫₀^π [(1 + cos t)/2]^n dt.\n\nProblem:\nShow that {a_n} converges to a real number a with a > 0.\n\nBut the example had multiple assumptions listed. Maybe in this case, the only assumption is the definition of a_n. The rest is the problem to be solved. However, the problem statement mentions that the exercise requires showing convergence to a real number a > 0. So the problem part would be \"Show that the sequence {a_n} converges to a real number a and that a > 0.\"\n\nBut the user's example formatted the problem by extracting the assumptions from the original problem. In the original problem, the user might have included some steps they took, like their estimation, but those aren't assumptions. The assumptions are the given conditions. So here, the problem defines a_n as that integral multiplied by sqrt(n), and the task is to prove convergence to a positive real number.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list the definition of a_n. Each part of the definition as a separate assumption? Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. The user in the example might have made an error. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But I should follow their structure regardless.\n\nIn their example, they listed assumptions as properties given in the problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. Then the formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is: the sequence {a_n} is defined by that integral, and the task is to show convergence to a real a > 0. So the assumptions here would be the definition of a_n, right? Since the problem is to show convergence, the assumption is the definition of a_n. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence {a_n} is defined as a_n = √n * ∫₀^π [(1 + cos t)/2]^n dt.\n\nProblem:\nShow that {a_n} converges to a real number a with a > 0.\n\nBut the example split assumptions into multiple lines. In the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\", and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example problem, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. So perhaps the example is wrong. Maybe the user made a mistake there. But regardless, I need to structure the current problem as per the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the user provided:\n\nOriginal problem:\nTitle: Estimating the integral sqrt(n) * int_0^pi ((1 + cos t)/2)^n dt\nQuestion: Consider the sequence {a_n} defined by a_n = sqrt(n) * int_0^pi ((1 + cos t)/2)^n dt. An exercise in Rudin requires showing that this sequence converges to a real number a, with a > 0.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. The sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = sqrt(n) * ∫₀^π [(1 + cos t)/2]^n dt.\n\nProblem:\nShow that {a_n} converges to a real number a with a > 0.\n\nBut according to the example, which split the assumptions into multiple lines, even if they're part of the same definition. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then another assumption was \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user intended to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. Perhaps in the original example, the problem had some hidden assumption. But I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the current problem, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, which is the definition of a_n. So the assumption is the definition of the sequence {a_n}. Then the problem is to show convergence to a positive real number.\n\nTherefore, following the example's format, even if the example might have been incorrect, I need to list each assumption line by line. In this case, the only assumption is the definition of a_n. However, the definition has multiple parts: it's a sequence defined as sqrt(n) multiplied by the integral from 0 to pi of [(1 + cos t)/2]^n dt. Should each part be a separate assumption?\n\nWait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So each line is a separate condition. In the current problem, the definition of a_n includes multiple components: the integral, the sqrt(n) factor, the interval from 0 to pi, the integrand [(1 + cos t)/2]^n. But I think the main assumption is the entire definition of a_n. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence {a_n} is defined as a_n = √n * ∫₀^π [(1 + cos t)/2]^n dt.\n\nProblem:\nShow that {a_n} converges to a real number a with a > 0.\n\nBut the example split assumptions into separate lines. If there's only one assumption here, then that's okay. The user's example had two assumptions, but maybe in some problems there are multiple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's task has two parts: convergence to a real number and a > 0. But in the problem statement, it's mentioned as \"convergent to a real number a, with a > 0\", so it's a single problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = √n ∫₀^π [(1 + cos t)/2]^n dt.\n\nProblem:\nShow that {a_n} converges to a real number a with a > 0.\n\nThat seems correct. The assumptions are the given conditions, which here is the definition of the sequence. The problem is the task to prove convergence to a positive real number.",
