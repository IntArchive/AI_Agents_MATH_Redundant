    "Content": "Let $A, B \\in M_n(\\mathbb{R})$ such that : $AB-BA$ invertible and $A^2+B^2 = AB$ then prove that : $3 \\mid n$ . I tried to manipulate or find some factorisation in order to be able to use efficiently eigenvalues...  but I dind't find anything. Thank you !",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is an addendum to Sqyuli's answer that (hopefully) explains some of the motivation behind the solution. It's too long to phrase in a comment, so I'll add a bit of the sketch of that answer here (in slightly different notation) Set $\\omega$ be a primitive third root of unity (note that $\\omega^2+\\omega+1=0$ ). Let $A+\\omega B=M$ , and consider $M\\overline{M}$ . Show that $\\det(M\\overline{M})$ is real. Use the second condition to reduce this to $\\omega(BA-AB)$ , and see $$\\det(\\omega(BA-AB))=\\omega^n\\det(BA-AB)\\in\\mathbb{R}.$$ Conclude that $3\\mid n$ . The key motivating step is to notice the factorization $$a^2+ab+b^2=(a+\\omega b)\\left(a+\\frac{1}{\\omega} b\\right),$$ which one can notice for example by noting $\\frac{a^3-b^3}{a-b}=a^2+ab+b^2$ . Unfortunately, this isn't applicable directly, as for one we certainly can't say that $A$ and $B$ commute (which would allow us to factor the second condition but invalidate the first). However, it does indicate somehow that $A\\pm\\omega B$ could be useful, and $A\\pm\\frac{1}{\\omega}B$ as well via multiplication of the two. We attempt this, and see (remembering that $A$ and $B$ do not commute) that \\begin{align*}\n(A+\\omega B)\\left(A+\\frac{1}{\\omega} B\\right)\n&=A^2+B^2+\\omega(BA)+\\frac{1}{\\omega}(AB)\\\\\n&=AB\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\right)+\\omega(BA)\\\\\n&=\\omega(BA)-\\omega(AB)\\\\\n&=\\omega(BA-AB),\n\\end{align*} from which the importance of the first condition becomes apparent.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original problem is about matrices A and B where AB - BA is invertible and A² + B² = AB, leading to the conclusion that 3 divides n. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question correctly. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. So, for the given problem, I should identify all the assumptions.\n\nThe problem states: A and B are in M_n(ℝ), AB - BA is invertible, and A² + B² = AB. Then we need to prove 3 divides n. \n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. A and B are matrices in M_n(ℝ). So, each is an n×n real matrix.\n2. AB - BA is invertible. This is a specific condition on the commutator of A and B.\n3. A² + B² = AB. Another condition relating A and B.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show that 3 divides n under these conditions.\n\nWait, the original example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the conclusion is that 3 divides n. So in the assumptions, we don't have n divisible by 3; that's the conclusion. So the assumptions are the three points above.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should list these three assumptions, each on a separate line, and then the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: Let A, B ∈ M_n(ℝ) such that AB - BA is invertible and A² + B² = AB. Prove that 3 divides n.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n- A and B are elements of M_n(ℝ) (so they are n×n real matrices)\n- AB - BA is invertible\n- A² + B² = AB\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that 3 divides n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted version should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are elements of M_n(ℝ),\nAB - BA is invertible,\nA² + B² = AB.\n\nProblem:\nProve that 3 divides n.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line and only one condition per line. Yes, each of those is a separate condition. The first line defines the objects A and B, the second their commutator being invertible, the third the equation they satisfy. Then the problem is to show 3 | n.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's example had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in this problem, n is given as the size of the matrices, so the assumptions are on A and B. The conclusion is about n. So the assumptions are correctly listed as the three points above.",
