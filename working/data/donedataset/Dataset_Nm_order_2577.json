    "Content": "$$\\binom{n}{m}-\\binom{n}{m+1}+\\binom{n}{m+2}-\\cdots+(-1)^{n-m}\\binom{n}{n}=\\binom{n-1}{m-1}$$\nNote that we can show this with out using inclusion and exclusion principle by using Pascal's Identity i.e. $C(n,k)=C(n-1,k)+C(n-1,k-1)$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is too long for a comment, that's why I'm putting it here. The first observation is that your formula already implies Pascal's identity. Replacing $m$ by $m+1$ we have\n$$\\binom{n}{m+1}-\\binom{n}{m+2}+\\cdots+(-1)^{n-m-1}\\binom{n}{n}=\\binom{n-1}{m}.$$\nAdding to the original formula gives (after cancelling) $\\binom{n-1}{m}+\\binom{n-1}{m-1}=\\binom{n}{m}$. So, in some sense, any proof of this identity must include some idea proving Pascal's. Now there is a way to putting the LHS as an application of Inclusion-Exclusion principle. Take the following sets: $$\n\\begin{align}\nA_1 &:= \\left\\{1,2,\\dots,\\textstyle\\binom{n-1}{m-1}\\right\\}\\\\\nA_2 &:= \\left\\{1,2,\\dots,\\textstyle\\binom{n-2}{m-1}\\right\\}\\\\\n &\\dots \\\\\nA_{n-m+1} &:= \\left\\{\\textstyle\\binom{m-1}{m-1}\\right\\} =\\{1\\}.\n\\end{align}\n$$\nSo we have $A_1\\supset A_2 \\supset \\dots \\supset A_{n-m+1}$. If you apply In-Ex to prove that \n$$\n|A_1\\cup \\dots \\cup A_{n-m+1}| = |A_1|=\\textstyle\\binom{n-1}{m-1},\n$$\nyou may obtain (through extensive use of Pascal's and perhaps also induction) the summation on the LHS of your equation.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, looking at the example provided. The original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement. So the key is to extract each assumption as a single line, each addressing one property of a single object.\n\nNow, the current problem from Math Stack Exchange is about proving a combinatorial identity using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The identity given is:\n\n$$\\binom{n}{m} - \\binom{n}{m+1} + \\binom{n}{m+2} - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-m}\\binom{n}{n} = \\binom{n-1}{m-1}$$\n\nThe note mentions that it can be shown without inclusion-exclusion using Pascal's Identity, but the question specifically asks to prove it using inclusion and exclusion principle.\n\nSo, the task is to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. Let's think about the assumptions here. The variables involved are n and m. Since it's a combinatorial identity involving binomial coefficients, we need to consider the conditions on n and m. For binomial coefficients, typically n and m are non-negative integers with m ≤ n. However, in the identity, the sum goes from m to n, so m must be less than or equal to n. Also, the exponents on (-1) go up to n - m, which suggests that n ≥ m. Additionally, m must be at least 1 because on the RHS, we have binomial coefficient (n-1 choose m-1), which requires m-1 ≥ 0, so m ≥ 1. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. m is a positive integer.\n3. m ≤ n.\n\nEach of these addresses a single condition on one object. So each line is a separate assumption.\n\nThe problem then is to prove the given identity using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The note about using Pascal's Identity is probably a hint or a side note, but the main problem is to use inclusion-exclusion. So the problem statement would be exactly as given, but specified to use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, but the original question says \"How do I prove this combinatorial identity using inclusion and exclusion principle?\" So the user is asking for a proof via inclusion-exclusion. So in the problem section, we need to state that requirement.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nm is a positive integer,\nm ≤ n.\n\nProblem:\nProve using the inclusion-exclusion principle that \n$$\\binom{n}{m} - \\binom{n}{m+1} + \\binom{n}{m+2} - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-m}\\binom{n}{n} = \\binom{n-1}{m-1}.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included the divisibility condition. Here, the assumptions are the standard conditions for the binomial coefficients. But maybe the problem doesn't have any additional constraints beyond the standard ones. Let me check: The identity holds for n and m integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ n. So yes, those are the assumptions. Each line is a separate assumption about one object (n and m). So each of the three conditions: n positive integer, m positive integer, m ≤ n. So that's three separate assumptions.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is a positive integer,\nm is a positive integer,\nm ≤ n.\nProblem:\nProve using the inclusion-exclusion principle that $$\\binom{n}{m}-\\binom{n}{m+1}+\\binom{n}{m+2}-\\cdots+(-1)^{n-m}\\binom{n}{n}=\\binom{n-1}{m-1}$$\n###",
