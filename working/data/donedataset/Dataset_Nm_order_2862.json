    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that B^∨ is a base for the coroot system Φ^∨. They mentioned that B is a base for Φ, which means B is a basis for the vector space E, and every root in Φ can be expressed as a linear combination of the base elements with integer coefficients that are all non-negative or all non-positive.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A base for a root system has two main properties: it's a basis for the space, and each root can be written as a combination of base elements with coefficients of the same sign. The user already noted that B^∨ is a basis for E, so the first part is done. The challenge is the second property.\n\nThe user started by taking a root α in Φ, which can be written as α = ∑k_β β with k_β integers of the same sign. Then they considered α^∨ = 2α/(α, α). Substituting α's expression, they get α^∨ = ∑ [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] β^∨. They need to show that the coefficients here are integers with the same sign.\n\nWait, the coefficients in the expression for α^∨ are [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)]. The user is stuck on proving these are integers. Since k_β are integers, if (β, β)/(α, α) is rational, then the product might be an integer. But how do we know that?\n\nIn root systems, especially when dealing with dual root systems, there's a relationship between the roots and coroots. The ratio (β, β)/(α, α) is related to the Cartan matrix. The entries of the Cartan matrix are 2(α, β)/(α, α), which are integers. But I'm not sure how that connects here.\n\nMaybe we need to use the fact that in a base B, the Cartan matrix entries are integers. Since B is a base, for any α, β in B, 2(α, β)/(α, α) is an integer. This is part of the definition of a root system. So for simple roots α and β, (α, β) = integer * (α, α)/2. \n\nBut how does this help with (β, β)/(α, α)? Let's think. If we consider the ratio (β, β)/(α, α), in simply-laced root systems (like types A, D, E), all roots have the same length, so this ratio is 1, making the coefficient k_β * 1 = k_β, which is integer. So in that case, it's straightforward. However, in non-simply-laced systems (types B, C, F, G), roots can have different lengths. For example, in type B, long roots are shorter than short roots. Wait, no, in type B, the long roots are longer than the short ones. Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose α is a long root and β is a short root. Then (α, α) = 2, and (β, β) = 1 (if normalized that way). Then (β, β)/(α, α) = 1/2. If k_β is even, then the product would be integer. But how does that work?\n\nWait, maybe in the base B, when α is expressed in terms of B, the coefficients k_β are such that k_β*(β, β)/(α, α) is integer. For that, maybe (β, β) divides (α, α) times some integer. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to use the fact that the dual of a root system Φ^∨ is also a root system, and since B is a base for Φ, then B^∨ should be a base for Φ^∨. But how to formalize that?\n\nAnother approach: since Φ^∨ is a root system, and B^∨ is a basis, we need to check that every coroot in Φ^∨ can be written as a combination of B^∨ with coefficients of the same sign. Take any α^∨ in Φ^∨. Then α is in Φ, so α = ∑k_β β with k_β integers of same sign. Then α^∨ = ∑ [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] β^∨. So to show that the coefficients [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] are integers with the same sign. Since k_β are same sign, the coefficients will have same sign if (β, β)/(α, α) is positive, which it is because inner products are positive definite. So sign is preserved. But the integrality is the issue.\n\nHow to show that (β, β)/(α, α) is rational such that when multiplied by k_β, it's integer? Maybe we need to use properties of root systems. For any two roots α and β in Φ, the ratio (α, α)/(β, β) is 1, 2, or 3, or their reciprocals, depending on the root system. For example, in type G2, the ratio is 3. In type B, the ratio is 2. So in general, (β, β)/(α, α) is either 1, 1/2, 1/3, 2, or 3. So if we can show that for any α in Φ and β in B, k_β times this ratio is integer.\n\nBut how does k_β relate to this ratio? Maybe in the base, the coefficients k_β are such that when multiplied by the ratio (β, β)/(α, α), it becomes integer. For example, if α is a root expressed in terms of the base, then in non-simply laced cases, the coefficients might be adjusted according to the root lengths. For instance, in type B, where long roots have length sqrt(2) and short roots have length 1, if α is a long root, then (β, β)/(α, α) could be 1/2 if β is a short root. But then if k_β is even, then 1/2 * even = integer. But why would k_β be even?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coefficients k_β are divisible by the denominator of (β, β)/(α, α). For example, if (β, β)/(α, α) = 1/2, then k_β must be even. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps this comes from the fact that in the root system, the expression of α in terms of the base must satisfy certain integrality conditions. For example, in the Cartan matrix, the entries are integers, and when building the root system, the coefficients are generated via reflections which preserve integral combinations. So maybe the coefficients k_β are such that when multiplied by (β, β)/(α, α), they become integers. For example, if (β, β)/(α, α) = 1/2, then k_β must be even. But how to formalize this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the inverse of the Cartan matrix. The Cartan matrix relates the simple roots and their inner products. Since the Cartan matrix is integral with determinant ±1 or ±2, etc., depending on the root system, its inverse would have entries that are rational numbers. Then expressing α^∨ in terms of β^∨ would involve these rational coefficients, but the question is why they are integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to use the fact that in the dual root system, the coroots correspond to the co-weights, and the base of coroots corresponds to the dual basis. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a different angle. Since B is a base for Φ, then the Weyl group acts transitively on the bases. Similarly, for Φ^∨, the Weyl group is the same as for Φ, since the reflection s_α is the same as s_{α^∨}. Therefore, the Weyl group of Φ^∨ is the same. Thus, if B^∨ is a base, then it should satisfy the same properties. But this is more of a high-level argument, not a step-by-step proof.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the coroot system Φ^∨ is dual to Φ, and if B is a base for Φ, then B^∨ should be a base for Φ^∨. The key is to check the two conditions: basis and coefficients. The basis part is done. For the coefficients, take any α^∨ in Φ^∨, then α is in Φ, so α = sum k_β β with k_β integers of same sign. Then α^∨ = sum [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] β^∨. We need to show that [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] are integers of same sign. Since k_β are same sign, and the ratio (β, β)/(α, α) is positive, the coefficients have the same sign. Now, why are they integers?\n\nTo see why [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] is integer, note that in the expression of α as a combination of base elements, the coefficients k_β are integers. Also, in a root system, the ratio (α, α)/(β, β) is rational. In fact, in any root system, the squared lengths of roots are rational multiples of each other. This is because the root system is crystallographic, meaning that the Cartan numbers 2(α, β)/(β, β) are integers. So let's denote c_{α, β} = 2(α, β)/(β, β) ∈ ℤ. Then, we can relate (α, α) and (β, β) using these integers. \n\nSuppose we have two roots α and β in the base B. Then c_{α, β} = 2(α, β)/(β, β) is integer, and similarly c_{β, α} = 2(β, α)/(α, α) is integer. The product c_{α, β} c_{β, α} = 4 (α, β)^2 / [(α, α)(β, β)] is equal to 4 cos²θ, where θ is the angle between α and β. This product must be an integer between 0 and 4. Hence, the possible values are 0, 1, 2, 3, which correspond to angles θ such that cos²θ is 0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4. \n\nIn any case, from c_{α, β} and c_{β, α} being integers, we can find the ratio (α, α)/(β, β) = c_{β, α}/c_{α, β}. Therefore, (β, β)/(α, α) = c_{α, β}/c_{β, α}. So if we have this ratio as a rational number, then (β, β)/(α, α) = c_{α, β}/c_{β, α} is rational. \n\nNow, substituting back into the coefficient [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] = k_β * (c_{α, β}/c_{β, α}). Since k_β is an integer and c_{α, β}, c_{β, α} are integers, this is k_β times a rational number. But why is this necessarily an integer?\n\nAh, but in the expression of α as a combination of the base, the coefficients k_β satisfy certain divisibility conditions. Specifically, when building the root system from a base, the coefficients k_β are such that they are multiples of certain denominators to ensure that the combinations are roots. For instance, in non-simply laced root systems, the coefficients might be adjusted based on the root lengths. \n\nAlternatively, consider that since α is a root, and B is a base, the coefficients k_β are integers. The ratio (β, β)/(α, α) can be expressed as c_{α, β}/(2(β, α)/(α, α)) but I'm getting confused here. Wait, earlier we had (β, β)/(α, α) = c_{α, β}/c_{β, α}. So [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] = k_β * c_{α, β}/c_{β, α}. But we need this to be integer.\n\nIf c_{β, α} divides k_β * c_{α, β}, then it's integer. But why would c_{β, α} divide k_β * c_{α, β}? For example, in simply-laced cases, c_{α, β} = c_{β, α} = -1, so ratio is 1, and coefficients remain integers. In non-simply laced, suppose α is long and β is short. For type B, c_{α, β} = -2, c_{β, α} = -1. Then ratio is 2/1=2. So [k_β * 2]. Since α is a long root, when expressed in terms of the base which includes β (short), maybe k_β must be even? But why?\n\nWait, let's take a specific example. In type B2, the roots are long and short. Let’s say the base B consists of a long root α and a short root β. The Cartan matrix is [[2, -1], [-2, 2]]. So c_{α, β} = -1, c_{β, α} = -2. Then (β, β)/(α, α) = c_{α, β}/c_{β, α} = (-1)/(-2) = 1/2. So if we have a root α expressed as a combination of the base, say α = 1*α + 0*β. Then α^∨ = (2α)/(α, α). But wait, α^∨ = 2α/(α, α). If (α, α) = 2, then α^∨ = α. If α is part of the base B, then α^∨ is in B^∨. \n\nBut suppose we have another root, say γ = α + β. Then γ is a root. Expressing γ in terms of the base: γ = 1*α + 1*β. Then γ^∨ = 2γ/(γ, γ). Since in type B2, the long roots have (γ, γ) = 2 and short have (β, β) = 1. Wait, γ = α + β would be a long root or short? In B2, the highest root is α + 2β, which is long. Maybe γ = α + β is a short root. Wait, I need to be careful. In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The roots α and α + 2β are long, while β and α + β are short. So γ = α + β is short, so (γ, γ) = 1. Then γ^∨ = 2γ/1 = 2γ. Now, express γ^∨ in terms of B^∨. Since B^∨ is {α^∨, β^∨} = {α/1, 2β/1} (since α^∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α if (α, α)=2, and β^∨ = 2β/(β, β) = 2β). \n\nWait, no: if α is long, (α, α) = 2, so α^∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. β is short, (β, β) = 1, so β^∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. Then B^∨ = {α, 2β}. Now, γ^∨ = 2(α + β) = 2α + 2β. To express this in terms of B^∨: 2α + 2β = 2*α + 1*(2β). So coefficients are 2 and 1, which are integers of the same sign. \n\nBut in this case, γ = α + β, so k_α =1, k_β=1. Then according to the formula, the coefficient for α^∨ would be k_α*(β, β)/(γ, γ). Wait, no, wait. The original formula was α^∨ = sum [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] β^∨. Wait, but here α is the original root, which in this example is γ. So γ^∨ = sum [k_β (β, β)/(γ, γ)] β^∨. \n\nWait, let's substitute: γ = α + β = 1*α + 1*β. So k_α =1, k_β=1. Then γ^∨ = 1*(β, β)/(γ, γ) α^∨ + 1*(β, β)/(γ, γ) β^∨? Wait, no, the formula should be γ^∨ = sum [k_β (β, β)/(γ, γ)] β^∨. So each coefficient is k_β * (β, β)/(γ, γ). \n\nBut in our case, (β, β) =1, (γ, γ)=1 because γ is short. So for β in the base (which is β here?), wait, the base B is {α, β}. So for each β in B, we have to calculate k_β * (β, β)/(γ, γ). \n\nWait, confusion arises because the base elements are α and β. The original root γ is expressed as 1*α +1*β. Then, according to the formula:\n\nγ^∨ = [1*(α, α)/(γ, γ)] α^∨ + [1*(β, β)/(γ, γ)] β^∨.\n\nWait, no, the formula in the user's attempt was:\n\nα^∨ = sum [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] β^∨.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nFor α = sum k_β β, then α^∨ = sum [k_β (β, β)/(α, α)] β^∨.\n\nSo substituting γ = α + β, which is sum k_α α + k_β β with k_α=1, k_β=1. Then γ^∨ = [1*(α, α)/(γ, γ)] α^∨ + [1*(β, β)/(γ, γ)] β^∨.\n\nBut (α, α)=2, (β, β)=1, (γ, γ)=1. So coefficients are (2/1)*1 =2 and (1/1)*1=1. Therefore, γ^∨ = 2α^∨ +1 β^∨ = 2α + 2β. Which matches the earlier calculation (since β^∨=2β, so 2α^∨ is 2α, and 1β^∨ is 2β; total 2α + 2β). \n\nBut the coefficients in terms of B^∨ are 2 and 1, which are integers of the same sign. Thus, the formula works here. \n\nBut how does this happen in general? The key is that in the expression of a root α as a combination of the base B, the coefficients k_β are such that when multiplied by the ratio (β, β)/(α, α), the result is integer. \n\nIn the example above, (α, α)=2, (γ, γ)=1. So (α, α)/(γ, γ)=2, and k_α=1, so 1*2=2, which is integer. Similarly for β: (β, β)/(γ, γ)=1/1=1, so 1*1=1. \n\nIn another example, take the root α + 2β in B2, which is long. (α + 2β, α + 2β) = 2. Expressing it in terms of the base: α + 2β =1*α +2*β. Then (α + 2β)^∨ = (2(α + 2β))/2 = α + 2β. Expressing this in terms of B^∨ = {α, 2β}: α +2β =1*α +1*(2β), so coefficients 1 and1. \n\nBut according to the formula: coefficients are k_α*(α, α)/(α+2β, α+2β) =1*(2)/2=1, and k_β*(β, β)/(α+2β, α+2β)=2*(1)/2=1. So indeed, coefficients 1 and1. \n\nSo in these examples, the coefficients are integers. The reason is that (β, β)/(α, α) is rational, and k_β is chosen such that the product is integer. \n\nBut how to generalize this? Suppose in a general root system, when α is expressed as sum k_β β, then for each β, k_β * (β, β)/(α, α) is integer. \n\nSince Φ is crystallographic, which means that for any roots α and β, 2(α, β)/(β, β) is integer. This is crucial. Let's denote this as c_{α, β} = 2(α, β)/(β, β) ∈ ℤ. \n\nNow, consider the ratio (β, β)/(α, α). We can relate this to the Cartan integers. Let’s note that for roots α and β, (β, β)/(α, α) = c_{α, β}/c_{β, α}}. Because:\n\nc_{α, β} = 2(α, β)/(β, β)\nc_{β, α} = 2(β, α)/(α, α) = 2(α, β)/(α, α)\n\nThus, c_{α, β}/c_{β, α} = [2(α, β)/(β, β)] / [2(α, β)/(α, α)] = (α, α)/(β, β)\n\nTherefore, (β, β)/(α, α) = 1/(c_{α, β}/c_{β, α})} = c_{β, α}/c_{α, β}\n\nBut c_{α, β} and c_{β, α} are integers, and their ratio is rational. \n\nNow, in the expression of α as sum k_β β, the coefficients k_β are related to the Cartan matrix. In fact, the Cartan matrix entries are c_{β, α} for β, α ∈ B. The coefficients k_β satisfy the equations given by the Cartan matrix. \n\nPerhaps we can use induction on the height of the root α. The base case is when α is a simple root, then it's already in B, so k_β = δ_{α, β}, and the coefficients become (β, β)/(α, α) when β=α, which is 1, and 0 otherwise. For other roots, assume that the property holds for all roots of smaller height. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the Weyl group is generated by simple reflections, and each reflection preserves the lattice generated by the base. Since B^∨ is invariant under the Weyl group (since the Weyl group acts the same way on Φ^∨), then the coefficients must behave appropriately. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach: since the root system is crystallographic, the lattice generated by B is the same as the lattice generated by the root system. Similarly, the coroot lattice is generated by B^∨. \n\nWait, the key point might be that in a crystallographic root system, the ratio (β, β)/(α, α) is rational, and the coefficients k_β are such that when multiplied by this ratio, they remain integers. Because the root lattice is integral and the coroot lattice is dual, but I need to think carefully. \n\nAlternatively, recall that in the dual root system, the coroots are linear combinations of the original roots scaled by these ratios. Since the original root system is crystallographic, the necessary integrality conditions are satisfied. \n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to use the fact that in a base B, the expression of any root α as a combination of B has coefficients k_β that are integers of the same sign. Moreover, since Φ is crystallographic, the Cartan matrix entries c_{β, α} are integers, and thus the inverse of the Cartan matrix (which relates the fundamental weights to the simple roots) has rational entries. However, when expressing roots in terms of the base, the coefficients k_β are integers. \n\nGiven that (β, β)/(α, α) = c_{β, α}/c_{α, β}, and both c_{β, α} and c_{α, β} are integers, then (β, β)/(α, α) is a rational number. Therefore, k_β times this rational number must be an integer. Since the root system is crystallographic, this must hold. But why? Because the crystallographic condition ensures that the root lattice is integral and that the Cartan matrix is integral, which imposes that the coefficients k_β are such that when multiplied by the ratio (β, β)/(α, α), the result is integer. \n\nAlternatively, consider that in the dual root system Φ^∨, the simple coroots B^∨ form a base if for every coroot α^∨ ∈ Φ^∨, the coefficients in the expansion over B^∨ are integers of the same sign. Since α^∨ is proportional to α, and the original coefficients k_β for α in Φ are integers of the same sign, scaling by (β, β)/(α, α) preserves the sign, and the crystallographic condition ensures the scaled coefficients are integers. \n\nI think the key insight is that the crystallographic property (integrality of the Cartan matrix) enforces that the ratios (β, β)/(α, α) times k_β are integers.
