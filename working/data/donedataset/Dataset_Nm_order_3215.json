    "Content": "Let $E\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ a measurable subset, $f\\in L^1(E)$ and $\\{E_n\\}$ a disjoint countable union of measurables sets such that $\\bigcup E_n=E$. Show that $$ \\int_Ef=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\int_{E_n} f$$ MY ATTEMPT (using a hint of the teacher): Let $f_n=f\\chi_{A_n}$, where $A_n=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}E_n$. As, $f\\in L^1(E)\\Rightarrow|f|\\in L^1(E)$. We have that $|f_n|\\leq|f|$ and\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}f_n=f\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\chi_{A_n}=f\\chi_E=f\n$$\nBy the Dominated Convergence Theorem (learn more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominated_convergence_theorem ), \n$$\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\int_Ef_n=\\int_Ef\n$$ Now is my doubt $$\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\int_Ef_n{=}^*\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\int_{E_n}f_n\n$$\nI don't know if I can affirm this last equality. Can someone explain this to me?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can affirm that (there is no \"n\" in the member of the right in your question, makes confusion): The $E_n$ are disjoint sets, so $$\\forall N \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\ \\sum_{n=1}^N \\int_{E_n} f=\\int_{\\bigcup\\limits_{n=1}^N E_n} f = \\int_{A_N}f = \\int_E f_N$$ The you take the limit when $N$ goes to $\\infty$, and i think you are done!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving countable additivity of the Lebesgue integral. The user has provided their attempt and a specific doubt about a step in their proof. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse through the problem statement:\n\n- The set E is a subset of the real numbers and is measurable.\n- The function f is in L^1(E), meaning it's integrable over E.\n- {E_n} is a countable collection of disjoint measurable sets whose union is E.\n\nThese are the main assumptions. The problem is to show that the integral of f over E equals the sum of the integrals over each E_n. The user's attempt uses the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) with functions f_n defined as f times the characteristic function of A_n, which is the union up to n. However, their confusion is about equating the limit of the integral of f_n to the infinite sum. \n\nIn the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are about the measurability of E and E_n, f being integrable, and the countable disjoint union. The problem is to show the integral over E equals the sum over E_n. \n\nI need to structure this correctly, making sure each assumption is a separate line. Also, the problem statement should be concise. The user's specific doubt is part of their attempt, but the core problem remains the countable additivity. So, the formatted problem should list the three assumptions and then state the problem as showing the integral equality.",
