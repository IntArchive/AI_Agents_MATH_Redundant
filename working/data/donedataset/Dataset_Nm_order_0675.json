    "Content": "We may be familiar that given the Fibonacci series $F_n = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,\\dots$ then $0.0112358\\dots\\approx 1/89$ . In fact, $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{F_n}{10^n} =\\frac{0}{10^0}+\\frac{1}{10^1}+\\frac{1}{10^2}+\\frac{2}{10^3}+\\dots = \\frac{10}{89}$$ How do we prove that more generally, for $p > 1$ then, $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{F_n}{p^n} = \\frac{p}{p^2-p-1}$$ The above simply was the case $p = 10$ . P.S. Similarly, given the tribonacci numbers $T_n$ , then, $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{T_n}{10^n}  = \\frac{100}{889}$$ See this related post .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can use Binet's formula, $$F_n=\\frac{\\phi^n-(-\\phi)^{-n}}{\\sqrt 5}$$ along with the usual geometric series formula to prove your claim: $$\\begin{align*}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{F_n}{p^n}&=\\frac1{\\sqrt 5}\\left(\\frac1{1-\\phi/p}-\\frac1{1+(p\\phi)^{-1}}\\right)\\\\&=\\frac{p(\\phi^2+1)/(\\sqrt 5)}{(p-\\phi)(p\\phi +1)}\\\\&=\\frac{p\\phi}{\\phi p^2-(\\phi^2-1)p-\\phi}\\\\&=\\frac{p\\phi}{\\phi p^2-\\phi p-\\phi}\\\\&=\\frac{p}{p^2-p-1}\\end{align*}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that the original problem might have some assumptions listed, even if they're not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, the assumption about n being divisible by 7 wasn't in the original problem, but the formatted version included it. Wait, actually, looking back, maybe the example had a different original problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, but the original problem didn't mention that. Maybe the user made a mistake there? Or perhaps the example is showing how to extract implicit assumptions. Wait, but 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem actually requires that n satisfies certain divisibility conditions. But in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect, or perhaps the user intended to modify the problem. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the current problem given.\n\nThe problem from Math Stack Exchange is about proving that the sum of F_n / p^n from n=0 to infinity equals p/(p² - p -1) for p > 1. The user mentioned that for p=10, this gives 10/89, which matches the example. The question also references Tribonacci numbers and a related post, but those might be extraneous.\n\nThe task is to structure this problem into the Assumption and Problem sections. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's see. The problem states \"for p > 1\". So that's one assumption: p is a real number greater than 1. Also, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as F_n starting with 0, 1, 1, 2,... So maybe another assumption is that F_n is the Fibonacci sequence with F_0=0, F_1=1, etc. Also, the sum starts at n=0, so perhaps that F_0 is 0 is important. Let's list those.\n\nAssumptions:\n- F_n is the Fibonacci sequence defined by F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, and F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 2.\n- p is a real number greater than 1.\n- The series ∑_{n=0}^∞ F_n / p^n converges.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"for p > 1\", but maybe p is an integer? The original example used p=10, which is an integer. However, the problem states \"for p > 1\", so maybe p can be any real number greater than 1. However, when dealing with generating functions for Fibonacci numbers, typically the radius of convergence is related to the golden ratio, so perhaps p needs to be greater than the golden ratio for convergence. But the problem statement just says p > 1. Maybe the assumption is that the series converges, which might require p > φ (about 1.618...). However, the problem states \"for p > 1\", so perhaps the user wants to take that as given. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering formal power series, but the sum is numerical, so convergence is necessary. The problem might implicitly assume convergence for p >1, but maybe that's not accurate. The user probably wants to include the given conditions. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"How do we prove that more generally, for p > 1 then, [sum equals p/(p² - p -1)]\". So the user states p > 1 as a condition. Therefore, the assumptions should include that p is a real number greater than 1. Additionally, the definition of Fibonacci numbers as starting with F_0=0, F_1=1, etc., which is standard but should be included as an assumption. The problem statement also mentions the series starting at n=0, so F_0 is part of the sum. The example in the original problem includes F_0=0, which contributes 0 to the first term. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- F_n is the Fibonacci sequence with F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, and F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 2.\n- p is a real number greater than 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∑_{n=0}^∞ (F_n / p^n) = p / (p² - p - 1).\n\nWait, the problem might also require that the series converges, but the user included in the example that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't mention that. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example's formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, we need to follow the format. So perhaps the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem even if they are not explicitly stated. But in the Fibonacci problem, all conditions are given: p >1 and the Fibonacci sequence. So maybe no hidden assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions listed as the Fibonacci sequence definition and p >1. The problem is to prove the sum equals p/(p²-p-1).\n\nThe Tribonacci part is mentioned but it's in the P.S., so it's unrelated to the main problem. The related post is also extra. So we filter those out.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should have two assumptions and the problem statement.",
