    "AcceptedAnswer": "Given two nonoverlapping squares in a large square $Q$ there is a line $g$ separating the two squares. Assume $g$ is not parallel to one of the sides of $Q$ (otherwise we are done). Let $A$ and $C$ be the two vertices of $Q$ farthest away from $g$ on the two  sides of $g$. The two edges of $Q$ meeting at $A$ together with $g$ determine a rightangled triangle $T_A$, and similarly we get a rightangled triangle $T_C$; see the following figure. (One could draw a second figure where $g$ cuts off just one vertex $A$. The proof remains the same.) To finish the proof we need the following Lemma. Given a triangle $T_C$ with a right angle at $C$ the largest square inscribed in $T$ is the square with one vertex at $C$ and one vertex  at the intersection of the angle bisector at $C$ with  the hypotenuse of $T$. Sketch of proof of the Lemma: Put $C$ at the origin of the $(x,y)$-plane, and let $(a,0)$, $(0,b)$ be the other two vertices of $T$. We may assume two vertices of the inscribed square on the legs of $T$.  If $(u,0)$ and $(0,v)$ are these two vertices  the other two vertices are $(u+v,u)$ and $(v,u+v)$. It follows that $u$ and $v$ have to satisfy the conditions\n$$u\\geq0, \\quad v\\geq 0,\\quad {u+v\\over a}+{u\\over b}\\leq 1,\\quad {v\\over a}+{u+v\\over b}\\leq 1\\ .$$\nThese four conditions define a convex quadrilateral $P$ in the \"abstract\" $(u,v)$-plane. The vertices of $P$ are\n$$V_1=(0,0),\\quad  V_2=\\Bigl({ab\\over a+b},0\\Bigr),\\quad V_3=\\Bigl({a^2b\\over a^2+ab +b^2},{ab^2\\over a^2+ab +b^2}\\Bigr), \\quad V_4=\\Bigl(0,{ab\\over a+b}\\Bigr)\\ .$$\nComputation shows that \n$$|V_2|^2-|V_3|^2={a^4 b^4 \\over(a+b)^2(a^2+ab+b^2)^2}>0\\ .$$ Therefore $u^2+v^2$ ($=$ the square of the side length of our square) is maximal at the two vertices $V_2$ and $V_4$ of $P$, which correspond to the statement of the Lemma.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have two non-overlapping squares inside a unit square. Their side lengths are a and b, and we need to prove that a + b ≤ 1. Hmm, interesting. Let me start by understanding the problem correctly.\n\nFirst, the unit square is the big square with side length 1. Inside it, there are two smaller squares, A and B, with sides a and b. They don't overlap, which means their interiors don't intersect. So, they can be placed anywhere inside the unit square as long as they don't overlap. The goal is to show that the sum of their side lengths can't exceed 1.\n\nI remember that in packing problems, sometimes you use geometric arguments or area considerations. But since we're dealing with sums of sides rather than areas, maybe area alone isn't sufficient. Let's think. The combined area of the two squares would be a² + b². The maximum area possible inside the unit square is 1, but since they have to be non-overlapping, their areas must sum to less than or equal to 1. However, even if a + b were greater than 1, maybe their areas could still be less than 1. For example, if a = 0.6 and b = 0.6, a + b = 1.2, but the area would be 0.36 + 0.36 = 0.72, which is still less than 1. So the area argument alone doesn't help here.\n\nTherefore, we need a different approach. Maybe positioning. How can two squares be placed inside the unit square without overlapping? Perhaps considering their positions relative to the sides of the unit square.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe using the pigeonhole principle. If the squares are placed in such a way that each is in a different part of the unit square, then their sizes are constrained. But I need to make that precise.\n\nAlternatively, think about the maximum possible side lengths. If one square is as large as possible, say a = 1, then obviously b has to be 0. But if they are both smaller, how to bound their sum?\n\nWait, the problem states \"inside a unit square\", so they must be entirely contained within the unit square. So each square must be placed such that all its sides are within the unit square.\n\nSince they are non-overlapping, there must be some space between them. Maybe we can divide the unit square into regions and use some geometric inequalities.\n\nI recall that in some packing problems, you can project the squares onto the sides of the unit square. Let me think about projections. If we project both squares onto the x-axis, each square's projection is a interval of length a or b. Similarly for the y-axis. Since the squares don't overlap, their projections on both axes must not overlap as well? Wait, no. For example, two squares can be placed side by side horizontally, so their x-projections don't overlap, but their y-projections do. Alternatively, stacked vertically, their y-projections don't overlap. Or placed diagonally, such that their projections on both axes overlap but the squares themselves don't.\n\nHmm, so maybe the projection argument isn't straightforward. However, maybe if we consider that in each direction (x and y), the total length of projections can't exceed 1. But even if two squares are placed side by side along the x-axis, their projections would sum to a + b. If they are placed in the same horizontal strip, then their combined horizontal projection can't exceed 1. Similarly for vertical.\n\nWait, perhaps if we can show that either their horizontal projections sum to at most 1 or their vertical projections sum to at most 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of the squares. Let me denote the coordinates of the lower-left corners of squares A and B as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively. Since both squares are inside the unit square, we have x1 + a ≤ 1, y1 + a ≤ 1, similarly for square B: x2 + b ≤ 1, y2 + b ≤ 1. But since they don't overlap, either x2 ≥ x1 + a or x1 ≥ x2 + b (if they are separated horizontally), or y2 ≥ y1 + a or y1 ≥ y2 + b (if separated vertically). Or diagonally, but then both conditions would hold.\n\nBut how can we use this to get a + b ≤ 1? Maybe consider the worst case where the squares are placed in opposite corners. For example, square A is in the bottom-left corner, square B is in the top-right corner. Then, to avoid overlapping, the horizontal distance between them must be at least the sum of their sides, or the vertical distance must be. Wait, maybe not. If they are in opposite corners, their projections might overlap, but they don't overlap in space.\n\nWait, suppose square A is at (0,0) with side a, and square B is at (1 - b, 1 - b) with side b. Then, the horizontal distance between A and B is 1 - b - a. If 1 - b - a ≥ 0, then they don't overlap horizontally. Similarly, vertical distance is 1 - b - a. So to avoid overlap, we need 1 - a - b ≥ 0, so a + b ≤ 1. Wait, that's exactly what we need to prove. But is this always the case?\n\nWait, maybe this is the key. If two squares are placed in opposite corners, the distance between them must be such that their sides don't overlap. So, if you have a square of size a in one corner, the other square of size b in the opposite corner must be placed such that there's at least a distance of 0 between them? Wait, no. If they are in opposite corners, their projections on the axes would require that the horizontal and vertical gaps are both non-negative.\n\nAlternatively, if you place the two squares as close as possible to opposite corners, then the sum a + b cannot exceed 1. But maybe this is specific to that arrangement. How do we know that in any arrangement, a + b ≤ 1?\n\nPerhaps we can consider that in any placement, at least one of the gaps (horizontal or vertical) between the squares must be non-negative, leading to a + b ≤1.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the method of dividing the unit square into regions. Suppose we draw lines that separate the squares. Since the squares are axis-aligned (wait, the problem doesn't specify that the squares are axis-aligned). Wait, hold on! The problem doesn't state that the squares are axis-aligned. They can be rotated. That complicates things.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"two non-overlapping squares inside a unit square\". It doesn't specify that they are axis-aligned. So they can be rotated. Hmm, but then the previous approach with projections might not work. For example, a square rotated by 45 degrees has a larger projection on both axes.\n\nBut the problem is from Arthur Engel's book, so maybe there's a standard approach. Let me think.\n\nWait, if the squares can be rotated, then the maximum sum of a + b might be different. But Erdős is mentioned, so maybe there's an elegant proof regardless of rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the squares are assumed to be axis-aligned. Because in packing problems, sometimes they are. But the problem statement doesn't specify. Hmm.\n\nWait, the original question was edited to mention an \"ingenious answer\", so perhaps the solution isn't straightforward. Maybe it's using some geometric argument or an inequality.\n\nAlternatively, think about the maximum distance between points in the squares. If two squares are inside the unit square, the centers of the squares are at least (a + b)/2 apart? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that the unit square has diameter sqrt(2). If two squares are placed such that their centers are as far apart as possible, but that might not help.\n\nWait, another idea: If we consider the Minkowski sum of the two squares. The Minkowski sum of two squares with side lengths a and b would be a square with side length a + b. But since they are placed inside the unit square without overlapping, their Minkowski sum must fit within a square of side length 1 + something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the squares as being contained within the unit square, so their positions are constrained. If we can show that in order to fit both squares, their combined side lengths can't exceed 1.\n\nWait, here's an idea from another problem: For two squares inside a unit square, if they are placed in opposite corners, then a + b ≤1. But if they are placed adjacent to each other, say side by side, then a + b ≤1 as well. Wait, if they are placed side by side horizontally, then the total horizontal length is a + b ≤1. Similarly, if placed vertically. So in that case, a + b ≤1. If they are placed in some diagonal arrangement, perhaps overlapping in projection but not in area. But how does that affect the sum a + b?\n\nWait, if the squares are placed diagonally such that their projections on both axes overlap, but they don't overlap in the plane. For example, one square is in the bottom-left, and the other is towards the top-right, but rotated. Then, their projections on the x-axis would both span from 0 to some value, and similarly for the y-axis. But in that case, maybe the sum of their projections must not exceed 1 in at least one direction.\n\nWait, actually, here's a theorem: the sum of the side lengths of two non-overlapping squares in a unit square is at most 1. The standard proof, as I recall, uses the idea of considering the projections on the x and y axes. For each square, the side length is the maximum of its horizontal and vertical projections. Wait, but if the squares are rotated, their projections can be larger than their side lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For a square rotated by θ, the projection onto the x-axis is a * |cos θ| + a * |sin θ|, which for a square of side a, the projection length would be a (|cos θ| + |sin θ|). The maximum projection occurs at θ = 45°, where the projection is a * √2. But since the squares are inside the unit square, their projections must be less than or equal to 1. So, for example, if a square is rotated, its projection on both axes might be larger, but the sum of projections in each axis must still be ≤1.\n\nWait, maybe this is the key. If we consider the projections on the x-axis and y-axis.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have two squares, A and B, with side lengths a and b, possibly rotated. Let’s project both squares onto the x-axis. The projection of each square onto the x-axis is equal to the length of the square in the x-direction, which for a square rotated by angle θ, is a * (|cos θ| + |sin θ|). Similarly for the y-axis. However, the maximum projection of a square onto any axis is a * √2 (when θ = 45°). But since the squares are inside the unit square, their projections on the x-axis can't exceed 1, and same for the y-axis.\n\nBut if both squares are rotated such that their projections on the x-axis are maximized, then each projection would be a * √2 and b * √2. However, the sum of their projections on the x-axis must be ≤1. So, a * √2 + b * √2 ≤1, which would give a + b ≤1/√2 ≈0.707. But this contradicts the original problem's conclusion that a + b ≤1, so maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the projections must not overlap in at least one axis. If two squares are non-overlapping, then there exists an axis (either x or y) where their projections do not overlap. Therefore, the sum of their projections on that axis is ≤1. Since the projection of each square on that axis is at least equal to their side length (if they are axis-aligned), but if they are rotated, the projection could be larger. Wait, but even if they are rotated, the projection on any axis is at least a (since the side length is a, but projection could be less if rotated). Wait, no. For example, a square rotated by θ has projection a * |cos θ| + a * |sin θ| on any axis. Wait, actually, the projection length of a square on an axis is equal to the side length times (|cos θ| + |sin θ|). This is because the projection of the square onto the axis is the projection of its diagonal. Wait, no, the projection of the square onto the x-axis is the projection of its width. If the square is axis-aligned, the projection is a. If rotated by θ, then the projection would be a * cos θ + a * sin θ, assuming the sides are aligned with the rotation. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nActually, the maximum projection of a square with side length a onto the x-axis is a (when it's axis-aligned), and the minimum projection is a * |cos θ|, where θ is the angle between the square's side and the x-axis. Wait, no. If the square is rotated by θ, then the projection onto the x-axis is the maximum x-coordinate minus the minimum x-coordinate of the square. For a square centered at the origin, rotated by θ, the projection length would be a * (|cos θ| + |sin θ|). So, the projection length is a multiplied by (|cos θ| + |sin θ|). Similarly for the y-axis. The sum of the projections on the x and y axes for a single square would be a (|cos θ| + |sin θ|) + a (|sin θ| + |cos θ|)) = 2a (|cos θ| + |sin θ|). But I don't know if that's helpful.\n\nWait, let's suppose that for each square, the sum of its projections on the x and y axes is 2a (if axis-aligned, then projections are a on x and a on y, sum 2a). If rotated, the projections could be larger, but for a square of side a, the maximum projection on any single axis is a√2 (when θ = 45°). But the sum of projections on x and y axes would be a (|cos θ| + |sin θ|) + a (|sin θ| + |cos θ|) ) = 2a(|cos θ| + |sin θ|). The minimum value of this sum is 2a (when θ = 0° or 90°), and the maximum is 2a√2 (when θ = 45°). But I don't see how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since the squares are non-overlapping, there must be a direction (either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) where they are separated by some distance. If we can show that this separation imposes a constraint on a + b.\n\nWait, here's a thought from the answer mentioned in the edited question. The user mentions that after receiving an ingenious answer, they asked about five squares. Maybe the original solution uses a clever argument, like dividing the unit square into regions or using a tiling argument.\n\nWait, another approach: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or consider the areas where the squares can be placed. But since we're dealing with side lengths, not areas, this might not directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, use a continuity argument. Suppose we try to maximize a + b. If a + b >1, then show that the squares must overlap. Assume for contradiction that a + b >1, and then show that they must overlap. How?\n\nSuppose a + b >1. Place square A with side a in the unit square. Then, the remaining space in the unit square is 1 - a in each dimension. But if b >1 -a, then square B can't fit in the remaining space. But this is only true if they are placed along one axis. If they are placed in different orientations, maybe b can still fit.\n\nWait, but if a + b >1, then even if you place one square horizontally and the other vertically, the sum of their sides in at least one direction would exceed 1. For example, if you place square A horizontally taking up a length of a, then the remaining horizontal space is 1 - a. If b >1 - a, then square B can't be placed without overlapping horizontally. Similarly, vertically. But if square B is placed in a different orientation, maybe rotated, could it fit?\n\nWait, if square B is rotated, its projection on the horizontal axis would be larger. For instance, if b is the side length, then the horizontal projection could be up to b√2. So if a + b√2 >1, then even if square A is placed with horizontal projection a, square B's horizontal projection would require more than 1 - a, hence overlap. But since we supposed a + b >1, then even if b√2 >1 -a, but this doesn't necessarily lead to a contradiction.\n\nHmm, maybe this line of reasoning isn't working. Let's think of a different approach.\n\nWait, I remember that in the book \"Problem Solving Strategies\" by Arthur Engel, this problem is included, and the solution might involve dividing the unit square into four regions using two lines and applying the pigeonhole principle. Let me try to recall.\n\nSuppose we divide the unit square into four smaller squares by drawing a vertical line and a horizontal line through the center. Each smaller square has side length 1/2. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, if we have two squares, they must be placed in two of these smaller squares. But each smaller square can contain at most a square of side 1/2. Therefore, a and b are each ≤1/2, so a + b ≤1. But wait, this would give a + b ≤1, but this is only if both squares are placed in separate quadrants, each of side 1/2. However, this is not necessarily the case. The two squares could be placed in the same quadrant, but then they would overlap. Wait, if they are non-overlapping, they must be in different quadrants. But if the original square is divided into four quadrants, then any two non-overlapping squares must lie in different quadrants, hence each has maximum side 1/2, so sum 1. But this seems too restrictive. For example, you can have a square of side 0.6 placed in the unit square, which would span multiple quadrants.\n\nWait, this approach doesn't work because the two squares can be larger than 1/2. For example, a square of side 0.6 can be placed in the unit square, overlapping multiple quadrants. Therefore, the pigeonhole principle with four quadrants doesn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide the unit square into two rectangles. For example, if we place two squares inside the unit square, there must be a line (horizontal or vertical) that separates them. Then, each rectangle can have a maximum side length of the square placed inside. So, suppose we have a vertical line dividing the unit square into two parts, left and right. If the left part has a square of side a, then the width of the left part is at least a, and the right part has width 1 - a, which must accommodate square B of side b. Therefore, b ≤1 - a, so a + b ≤1. Similarly for a horizontal division.\n\nBut how do we know such a line exists? If the two squares are non-overlapping, then there exists a line (either horizontal or vertical) that separates them. This is a result from geometry called the separating axis theorem. For two convex shapes (like squares), if they are non-overlapping, there exists a separating line. Moreover, for axis-aligned squares, the separating line can be either horizontal or vertical. But if the squares are rotated, the separating line can be at any angle. However, in our case, since we are dealing with a unit square, perhaps we can assume the separating line is either horizontal or vertical.\n\nWait, even if the squares are rotated, there must be a direction (horizontal or vertical) where their projections do not overlap. By the separating axis theorem, two convex shapes are disjoint if and only if there exists a line such that the projections of the shapes onto that line do not overlap. For our case, the squares are convex, so if they are non-overlapping, there exists such a line. However, this line could be at any angle. But maybe for squares inside a unit square, we can find a horizontal or vertical line that separates them.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the separating line is either horizontal or vertical, then the projections onto that axis would not overlap. Hence, the sum of the projections on that axis would be ≤1. But the projections of the squares on that axis would be ≥a and ≥b (since the projection of a square onto an axis is at least the side length times cos θ, where θ is the angle between the square's side and the axis). Wait, but if the square is rotated, the projection can be less than the side length. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait, let's suppose that there exists a separating line, either horizontal or vertical. If the separating line is vertical, then the two squares are on opposite sides of the line. Therefore, the sum of their widths (projections onto the x-axis) must be ≤1. Similarly, if the separating line is horizontal, the sum of their heights (projections onto the y-axis) must be ≤1.\n\nBut the problem is that the projections of the squares onto the axis could be larger than their side lengths if they are rotated. For example, a square rotated by 45 degrees has a projection of a√2 on both axes. So, even if the sum of their side lengths is 1, their projections could exceed 1, leading to overlap. But the original problem states that the squares are inside the unit square, so their projections must be ≤1. Therefore, if a square is rotated, its projection on each axis is ≤1. Therefore, the projection of each square on any axis is ≤1. But this doesn't directly give us a + b ≤1.\n\nWait, but if we can find an axis (horizontal or vertical) where the projections of both squares are such that their sum is ≤1, then we can relate that to their side lengths.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the side length of a square is less than or equal to its projection on any axis. Wait, no. If a square is rotated, its projection on an axis can be larger than its side length. For example, a square of side 1 rotated by 45 degrees has a projection of √2/2 on both axes, which is less than 1. Wait, that's actually smaller. Wait, no: the projection length of a square rotated by θ is a * (|cos θ| + |sin θ|). For θ=45°, it's a*(√2/2 + √2/2) = a√2. So if a=1/√2, the projection would be 1. So, a square with side a can have a maximum projection of a√2 on any axis. Therefore, to fit inside the unit square, we must have a√2 ≤1, so a ≤1/√2. But this would imply that a + b ≤2/√2=√2≈1.414, which is larger than 1. But the problem states a + b ≤1, which is tighter. Therefore, the projection argument might not be sufficient.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's look for the standard solution.\n\nUpon checking, I recall that this problem is classic and the solution involves considering that the two squares must be separated by at least a distance that allows their sum to be at most 1. The standard proof involves positioning the squares such that each is in a corner, and then showing that their combined size can't exceed 1.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each square must have its own \"territory\" within the unit square. For example, each square must be contained within a subsquare, and the subsquares must be non-overlapping. The maximum size of each subsquare is such that their sum is 1.\n\nBut I need to structure the problem according to the user's format. The user wants the assumptions and the problem. Looking back at the example, the assumption lists the conditions applied to each object. In the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. For this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The unit square has side length 1.\n- Squares A and B are inside the unit square.\n- Squares A and B are non-overlapping.\n- The side lengths of A and B are a and b, respectively.\n\nBut the user wants each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe unit square has side length 1.\nSquare A is inside the unit square.\nSquare B is inside the unit square.\nSquare A has side length a.\nSquare B has side length b.\nSquares A and B are non-overlapping.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a + b ≤ 1.\n\nBut the original problem states \"two non-overlapping squares inside a unit square\", so maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are squares.\nA and B are inside a unit square.\nA and B do not overlap.\nA has side length a.\nB has side length b.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a + b ≤ 1.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is one property applied to one object. For example, \"A and B are squares\" is one assumption. \"A and B are inside a unit square\" is another. Etc.",
