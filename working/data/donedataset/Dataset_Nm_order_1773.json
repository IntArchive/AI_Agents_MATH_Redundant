    "Content": "Let $M$ be a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold with metric $g_{ab}$. Let $\\nabla_a$ be the Levi-Civita connection on $M$. It's well-known that the Laplace—Beltrami operator can be defined in this context as\n$$\\nabla^2 = \\nabla^a \\nabla_a = g^{ab} \\nabla_a \\nabla_b$$\nwhere $g^{ab}$ is the dual metric and repeated indices are summed. However, we also have the coordinate formula\n$$\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{| \\det g |}} \\partial_a \\left( \\sqrt{| \\det g |} g^{ab} \\partial_b \\phi \\right)$$\nwhich, as I understand, comes from using the formula for the Hodge dual. Without invoking advanced machinery, what is the easiest way to directly prove the equivalence of the two definitions? I can see that if the partial derivatives of $g_{ab}$ vanish, then \n$$\\nabla_{a} \\left( g^{ab} \\nabla_b \\phi \\right) = \\partial_a \\left( g^{ab} \\partial_b \\phi \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{| \\det g |}} \\partial_a \\left( \\sqrt{| \\det g |} g^{ab} \\partial_b \\phi \\right)$$\nand in the general case it suffices to prove that\n$$\\Gamma^{b}_{\\phantom{b}ab} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{| \\det g |}} \\partial_a \\left( \\sqrt{| \\det g |} \\right)$$\nbut then it is seems to be necessary to compute the derivative of a determinant. Is there a trick which can be used to avoid this calculation?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For general relativity students I think this might be a reasonable proof. One needs to know that your second expression for $\\nabla^2\\phi$ (the one using $\\sqrt{|\\det g|}$) is independent of the choice of coordinates (*). For any point you can then choose coordinate system such that $\\partial_a g_{bc}=0$ and the two formulas (as you notice) give the same result. (*) means (as you also notice - you just want us to restate it in a simpler language - and I'm not sure whether I succeed to do it) that if $u^a$ is a vector-valued density, i.e. if $u^a=v^a \\sqrt{|\\det g|}$ where $v^a$ is a vector field, then $\\partial_a u^a$ is a density, i.e. $\\partial_a u^a=f\\sqrt{|\\det g|}$ for some function $f$ (with $f$ independent of the choice of coordinates - which implies $f=\\nabla_av^a$). If we really want to avoid differential forms then we can invoke Gauss theorem (in coordinates), notice that the flow of $u^a$ though a hypersurface is independent of the coordinates, and hence its divergence $\\partial_a u^a$ is a well-defined (independent of coordinates) density. edit: here is (really the same, but) a bit more sensible argument why $f$ (see above) is independent of coordinates. If $\\psi$ is a function with compact support then $\\int (\\partial_a\\psi)\\, v^a \\sqrt{|\\det g|} dx^1\\dots dx^n$ is independent of the choice of coordinates, and it is equal to (by per partes) \n$$-\\int \\psi \\partial_a\\Bigl( v^a \\sqrt{|\\det g|}\\Bigr)\\sqrt{|\\det g|}^{-1}\\,\\sqrt{|\\det g|} dx^1\\dots dx^n$$\nwhich shows (by choosing $\\psi$ with smaller and smaller support and with $\\int\\psi\\sqrt{|\\det g|} dx^1\\dots dx^n=1$) that\n$$f=\\partial_a\\Bigl( v^a \\sqrt{|\\det g|}\\Bigr)\\sqrt{|\\det g|}^{-1}$$\nis independent of coordinates.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show the equivalence between two definitions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold. The first definition is using the Levi-Civita connection: ∇²φ = ∇ᵃ∇ₐφ = gᵃᵇ∇ₐ∇₆φ. The second is the coordinate formula involving the determinant of the metric: ∇²φ = (1/√|det g|) ∂ₐ(√|det g| gᵃᵇ ∂ᵦφ). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between the covariant derivative and the partial derivative. The covariant derivative of a function is just the partial derivative, so ∇ₐφ = ∂ₐφ. But when taking the second derivative, we have to consider the connection coefficients (Christoffel symbols). So ∇ᵃ∇ₐφ would involve taking the covariant derivative of the gradient, which introduces terms with Γ.\n\nThe user already mentions that in the case where the partial derivatives of the metric vanish, the equivalence holds because the covariant derivative reduces to the partial derivative. But in the general case, the Christoffel symbols come into play. The key seems to be relating the divergence of a vector field in the covariant derivative sense to the coordinate expression involving the determinant of the metric.\n\nThe user also points out that Γᵇ_{ab} can be expressed in terms of the derivative of the determinant of the metric. I remember that the contraction of the Christoffel symbols Γᵇ_{ab} is related to the derivative of the logarithm of the determinant of the metric. Specifically, Γᵇ_{ab} = (1/√|det g|) ∂ₐ(√|det g|). If that's the case, then substituting this into the covariant derivative expression should give the coordinate formula.\n\nBut how does that substitution work? Let's expand the covariant derivative expression. Starting with ∇ᵃ∇ₐφ = gᵃᵇ∇ₐ∇₆φ. Since ∇ₐφ = ∂ₐφ, then ∇₆φ is ∂₆φ. Now, ∇ₐ(∇₆φ) = ∂ₐ(∂₆φ) - Γᵈ_{ₐ₆} ∂_d φ. Wait, no. Actually, the covariant derivative of a covector is ∇ₐ(∇₆φ) = ∂ₐ(∂₆φ) - Γᵈ_{ₐ₆} ∂_d φ. Then, when we contract with gᵃᵇ, we get gᵃᵇ [∂ₐ∂₆φ - Γᵈ_{ₐ₆} ∂_d φ]. But this seems a bit messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that ∇ᵃ∇ₐφ is the divergence of the gradient. The divergence of a vector field Vᵃ in coordinates is ∇ₐVᵃ = ∂ₐVᵃ + Γᵃ_{a b} Vᵇ. But wait, for the gradient of φ, the vector is gᵃᵇ ∂ᵦφ, so maybe first compute ∇ₐ( gᵃᵇ ∂ᵦφ ). Hmm, but the divergence would be ∇ₐ( gradient φ )^a. Let's clarify.\n\nThe gradient of φ is the vector field grad φ = gᵃᵇ ∂₆φ ∂_a. Then the divergence of this vector field is ∇ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂₆φ). But ∇ₐ Vᵃ = ∂ₐ Vᵃ + Γᵃ_{a b} Vᵇ. So substituting Vᵃ = gᵃᵇ ∂₆φ, we get:\n\n∇ₐ Vᵃ = ∂ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂₆φ) + Γᵃ_{a b} g^{b c} ∂_c φ.\n\nBut wait, the indices here need to be consistent. Let me reindex properly. Let’s write Vᵃ = gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ. Then the divergence is:\n\n∇ₐ Vᵃ = ∂ₐ Vᵃ + Γᵃ_{a b} Vᵇ = ∂ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ) + Γ�a_{a b} g^{b c} ∂_c φ.\n\nBut in the coordinate formula, we have (1/√|g|) ∂ₐ (√|g| gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ). So expanding this, it would be:\n\n(1/√|g|) [ ∂ₐ (√|g| gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ) ] = (1/√|g|) [ ∂ₐ (√|g|) gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ + √|g| ∂ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n( ∂ₐ (√|g|) / √|g| * gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ + ∂ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ)\n\nBut ( ∂ₐ (√|g|) ) / √|g| is (1/(2√|g|)) ∂ₐ |g| / √|g| ) which is (1/(2|g|)) ∂ₐ |g|. However, there's a formula that ∂ₐ |g| = |g| g^{cd} ∂ₐ g_{cd}. But maybe more straightforwardly, using the identity Γ�b_{a b} = (1/√|g|) ∂ₐ √|g|. \n\nIf that's the case, then ( ∂ₐ √|g| ) / √|g| = Γᵇ_{a b}. \n\nTherefore, substituting back into the coordinate formula, we have:\n\nΓᵇ_{a b} gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ + ∂ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ)\n\nBut this seems a bit tangled. Let's check indices. Wait, in the first term, Γᵇ_{a b} is contracted with gᵃᵇ and ∂_b φ. Wait, perhaps there's a way to relate these terms to the divergence expression from the covariant derivative.\n\nLooking back at the divergence expression:\n\n∇ₐ Vᵃ = ∂ₐ Vᵃ + Γᵃ_{a b} Vᵇ\n\nHere, Vᵃ = gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ. So substituting:\n\n∇ₐ Vᵃ = ∂ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ) + Γᵃ_{a b} g^{b c} ∂_c φ\n\nBut in the coordinate formula expanded, we have:\n\nΓᵇ_{a b} gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ + ∂ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ)\n\nComparing these two expressions, they look similar if Γᵃ_{a b} g^{b c} = Γᵇ_{a b} gᵃᵇ. Wait, perhaps there's an index relabeling here. Let me check:\n\nΓᵃ_{a b} g^{b c} = Γ^{c}_{a b} g^{b c} ? No, that's not straightforward. Maybe I need to use the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols. Wait, Γᵃ_{a b} = Γᵃ_{b a} because the connection is torsion-free. But not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to express Γᵇ_{a b} in terms of the metric. The identity mentioned earlier is Γᵇ_{a b} = (1/√|g|) ∂ₐ √|g|. If that's the case, then substituting into the coordinate formula's first term gives:\n\n(1/√|g|) ∂ₐ √|g| * gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ\n\nBut how does this relate to the covariant divergence expression? The covariant divergence is ∂ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ) + Γᵃ_{a b} g^{b c} ∂_c φ. If we can show that Γᵃ_{a b} g^{b c} = Γ^{c}_{a b} g^{b c} = Γᵇ_{a b} g^{c b} }? Not sure. Wait, perhaps using the identity for Γᵇ_{a b} and then seeing if that matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key step is to recognize that the coordinate expression includes the determinant term which accounts for the Christoffel symbols in the covariant derivative. By expanding the covariant derivative expression and using the identity for Γᵇ_{a b}, we can transform one into the other.\n\nThe user mentions that they want to avoid computing the derivative of the determinant directly, but maybe that's necessary. Alternatively, there's a trick using the properties of the Levi-Civita connection and the divergence theorem or something related to the volume form.\n\nWait, the volume form in coordinates is √|g| dx¹ ∧ ... ∧ dxⁿ. The divergence of a vector field can also be expressed as (1/√|g|) ∂ₐ (√|g| Vᵃ). So if we take Vᵃ = gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ, then ∇ₐ Vᵃ = (1/√|g|) ∂ₐ (√|g| Vᵃ) which is exactly the coordinate formula. Therefore, if we can show that the divergence of the gradient of φ in the covariant derivative sense equals the coordinate expression, then the equivalence is proven.\n\nBut how is this related to the definitions given? The Laplace-Beltrami operator is defined as the divergence of the gradient. So in the covariant derivative language, ∇²φ = ∇ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∇₆φ) = ∇ₐ (gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ), since ∇₆φ = ∂_b φ. Then using the divergence formula, this is (1/√|g|) ∂ₐ (√|g| gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ). Therefore, the equivalence follows from the general expression for the divergence of a vector field in terms of the metric and its determinant.\n\nSo maybe the trick is to recall that the divergence of a vector field can be written in two ways: one using the covariant derivative and the other using the coordinate expression with the determinant. Therefore, by recognizing that the Laplace-Beltrami operator is the divergence of the gradient, which is a vector field, we can directly apply this identity.\n\nThus, the answer would involve pointing out that the two expressions are equivalent because the covariant divergence of a vector field Vᵃ is equal to (1/√|g|) ∂ₐ (√|g| Vᵃ), and in this case, Vᵃ is the gradient of φ, which is gᵃᵇ ∂_b φ. Therefore, substituting Vᵃ into the divergence formula gives the coordinate expression, hence proving the equivalence without explicitly computing the derivative of the determinant.",
