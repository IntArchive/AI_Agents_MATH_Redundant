    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is: If we take 21 numbers randomly from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 40}, then among those 21 numbers, there must be at least two numbers where the smaller one divides the larger one. Hmm, interesting. I need to prove this.\n\nFirst, I remember something about the Pigeonhole Principle. That might be useful here. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. So maybe I can divide the numbers from 1 to 40 into different groups (pigeonholes) such that if two numbers are in the same group, one divides the other. Then, if we have 21 numbers (pigeons) and fewer than 21 groups, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two numbers must be in the same group, meaning one divides the other. That seems like a plan.\n\nBut how to create those groups? Let me think. Each number can be expressed as an odd number multiplied by a power of 2. For example, 12 can be written as 3 * 2^2. The odd part here is 3, and the power of 2 is 4. So maybe if I group numbers by their odd parts. Because if two numbers have the same odd part, then one must be a multiple of the other by some power of 2. For instance, 3 and 6 (which is 3*2) would be in the same group. Similarly, 5 and 10, 20, 40, etc.\n\nWait, let's test this idea. Take two numbers in the same group, meaning they have the same odd component. Let's say the group is defined by the odd number k. Then the numbers in the group would be k, 2k, 4k, 8k, etc., as long as they are within 1 to 40. So if two numbers are in the same group, the larger one is a multiple of the smaller one by a power of 2. Hence, the smaller divides the larger. That works. So each group is like a chain where each element is a multiple of the previous one by 2. \n\nNow, how many such groups are there in the set {1, 2, ..., 40}? Since each group is determined by an odd number, and the numbers from 1 to 40 include all odd numbers from 1 to 39. Let me count the odd numbers between 1 and 40. There are 20 odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., 39. Each of these is the base of a group. So there are 20 groups. For example, the group starting with 1 would be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. The group starting with 3 would be 3, 6, 12, 24. Similarly for 5: 5, 10, 20, 40. And so on. Each odd number leads to a sequence where each term is double the previous, until you exceed 40.\n\nSo if there are 20 groups, and we pick 21 numbers, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one group must contain two numbers. Then, those two numbers have the property that the smaller divides the larger. Therefore, the conclusion follows.\n\nWait, but let me check if all numbers are covered. For example, take 7. The group would be 7, 14, 28. 56 is beyond 40, so stop at 28. Similarly, 9 would be 9, 18, 36. Then 72 is over 40. So yes, each number from 1 to 40 can be written as an odd number times a power of 2, so each number belongs to exactly one group. Therefore, there are 20 groups. So if we pick 21 numbers, two must be in the same group, hence one divides the other. That seems correct.\n\nSo the key idea is partitioning the set into 20 groups where within each group, any two numbers have the smaller dividing the larger. Then, selecting 21 numbers forces at least one group to have two numbers, which gives the required pair. Therefore, the problem is solved using the Pigeonhole Principle with this grouping.",
