    "Content": "Let $\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ be symmetric positive definite. For some $1\\leq k<N$ , partition $$\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\mathbf{A}_{11} & \\mathbf{A}_{12} \\\\ \\mathbf{A}_{12}^T & \\mathbf{A}_{22}\\end{pmatrix},$$ where $\\mathbf{A}_{11}$ is $k\\times k$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{22}$ is $(N-k)\\times (N-k)$ . I'm trying to show that the principal submatrices $\\mathbf{A}_{11}$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{22}$ are also symmetric positive definite. I've been able to show that $$\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbf{A}_{11} & \\mathbf{A}_{12}\\\\\n\\mathbf{A}_{12}^T & \\mathbf{A}_{22} \\end{array} \\right ] = \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{A}^T = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbf{A}_{11}^T & \\mathbf{A}_{12}\\\\\n\\mathbf{A}_{12}^T & \\mathbf{A}_{22}^T \\end{array} \\right ]$$ This implies that $\\mathbf{A}_{11} = \\mathbf{A}_{11}^T$ , and $\\mathbf{A}_{22} = \\mathbf{A}_{22}^T$ . Thus, $\\mathbf{A}_{11}$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{22}$ are symmetric. I'm struggling to show that $\\mathbf{A}$ is positive definite. Does anyone have any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You know that positive definiteness means $v^TAv>0$ for all nonzero vectors $v$. Choose $v$ to be vectors with  non-zero entries only at the first $k$ positions. (And then do the opposite).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the principal submatrices A11 and A22 of a symmetric positive definite matrix A are also symmetric positive definite. The user already partitioned A into blocks where A11 is k x k and A22 is (N-k) x (N-k). They mentioned showing symmetry by using the transpose of A, and now they're stuck on proving positive definiteness.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. A is a symmetric positive definite matrix. That's given. Since it's positive definite, it's also symmetric by definition, but the problem states it's symmetric, so maybe that's redundant, but I should list it as per the problem statement.\n\n2. The matrix A is partitioned into blocks A11, A12, A12^T, A22, where A11 is k x k and A22 is (N - k) x (N - k). The problem specifies 1 ≤ k < N, so k is between 1 and N-1. That should be another assumption.\n\nThe problem is to show that A11 and A22 are symmetric positive definite. The user already handled symmetry via the transpose, so the remaining part is positive definiteness.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a symmetric matrix,\nA is positive definite,\nA is partitioned into blocks A11, A12, A12^T, A22,\nA11 is k×k,\nA22 is (N−k)×(N−k),\n1 ≤ k < N.\n\nProblem: Show that A11 and A22 are symmetric positive definite matrices.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the original question is \"to show that the principal submatrices A11 and A22 are also symmetric positive definite.\" Since symmetry was already shown, maybe the problem is only about positive definiteness? Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"I'm trying to show that the principal submatrices A11 and A22 are also symmetric positive definite. I've been able to show that [they are symmetric]... I'm struggling to show that A is positive definite.\" Wait, but A is already given as positive definite. The user probably meant to show that A11 and A22 are positive definite. So the problem is to show A11 and A22 are positive definite.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the problem part would be \"Prove that the principal submatrices A11 and A22 are symmetric positive definite.\"\n\nBut the user had already handled symmetry, so maybe the problem is just about positive definiteness. However, the original problem statement says \"to show that the principal submatrices... are also symmetric positive definite.\" So the problem includes both symmetry and positive definiteness, but the user has already addressed symmetry, so perhaps in the problem part, we can state both, but the user's focus is on the positive definiteness. However, according to the example, the problem part should reflect the original problem, even if parts have been addressed. The example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included both the divisibility by 7 and 13. Wait, no. The example given in the user's instruction had an original problem where n was any integer, but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, maybe the example is different. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. The original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, changing the problem. That might be a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Maybe in that example, the original problem had some hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7. But perhaps the user made a mistake. Anyway, following the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the given example, which lists assumptions line by line, each about one object.\n\nIn this case, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a symmetric matrix.\n- A is positive definite.\n- A is partitioned into blocks A11, A12, A12^T, A22.\n- A11 is k×k.\n- A22 is (N−k)×(N−k).\n- 1 ≤ k < N.\n\nProblem: Prove that the principal submatrices A11 and A22 are symmetric positive definite.\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem includes that they already showed symmetry, but the problem as stated in the question is to show both symmetry and positive definiteness. However, in the formatted problem, should the problem part include both, even if part of it is already solved? Or should it focus on the remaining part? The example given by the user included the original problem's entire statement but added an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that changes the problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to extract the problem's core. However, in the current case, the problem as stated by the user is to show that A11 and A22 are symmetric positive definite. The user has already shown symmetry, but the problem as a whole is to show both. So the formatted problem should reflect the original problem statement, even if part of it has been addressed. Therefore, the problem is to show that A11 and A22 are symmetric positive definite. The assumptions would include that A is symmetric positive definite and partitioned as given. So I think that's correct.",
