    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is talking about two integrals, R⁺ and R⁻, defined with these complicated integrands. The goal is to prove three conjectured identities: that their product is 1, and that each is the fourth root of ln2 and its reciprocal. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions that these are integrals from 0 to π/2, multiplied by 2/π. The integrands involve expressions with x² + ln²(cosx) raised to the 1/8 power for R⁺ and the inverse for R⁻. Then there's a nested square root structure in both. The assumptions should list each condition applied to each object. \n\nSo, R⁺ is defined as an integral with certain parameters and integrand. Similarly for R⁻. The assumptions should note the limits of integration, the integrand structure, and the constants involved. Each assumption line should address one property. Then the problem is to prove the three equations.\n\nWait, the original problem also mentions that these are called Ramanujan log-trigonometric integrals on MathWorld. But maybe that's extra info. The main assumptions are the definitions of R⁺ and R⁻, and the conjectured relations. But the user wants to filter unrelated info, so the key is to list each integral's structure, the limits, the multiplicative constants (2/π), and the integrand components. Then the problem is to prove equations 3,4,5.\n\nSo, in the assumptions, each line is one property. For example, R⁺ is an integral from 0 to π/2. Then another line about the integrand involving the 8th root of x² + ln²cosx, etc. Similarly for R⁻. Then the conjectures. Wait, but how to split the assumptions here? Each assumption line should be one condition applied to one object.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAssumption:\nR⁺ is defined as (2/π) multiplied by the integral from 0 to π/2 of [ (x² + ln²cosx)^{1/8} multiplied by sqrt(1/2 + (1/2)sqrt(1/2 + (1/2)sqrt(ln²cosx/(x² + ln²cosx))) ] dx,\n\nR⁻ is defined as (2/π) multiplied by the integral from 0 to π/2 of [ 1/(x² + ln²cosx)^{1/8} multiplied by sqrt(1/2 + (1/2)sqrt(1/2 + (1/2)sqrt(ln²cosx/(x² + ln²cosx))) ] dx,\n\nThe conjectures are that R⁺R⁻ = 1, R⁺ = (ln2)^{1/4}, and R⁻ = 1/(ln2)^{1/4}.\n\nBut in the example given earlier, the assumption lines are more atomic. So perhaps each part of the definition for R⁺ and R⁻ needs to be broken down. But maybe that's overcomplicating. The problem defines R⁺ and R⁻ with those integrals, so the main assumptions are the definitions of R⁺ and R⁻. Then the problem is to prove the three conjectured equations.\n\nSo, the Assumption section should list each integral's structure. But since each integral is a single definition, perhaps each integral's definition is one assumption. But the example's assumption had two lines: one about n being integer and another about divisibility by 7. Here, the problem is more about the definitions of R⁺ and R⁻. So maybe two assumptions: one for R⁺ and one for R⁻. Then the problem is to prove the three equations.\n\nBut wait, the example included even redundant assumptions (like n being integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem stated \"for every integer n\"). Maybe in that case, the user wanted to split the assumptions. But here, the problem states the definitions of R⁺ and R⁻, which are integrals with specific forms. So each integral's definition is one assumption. Additionally, the conjectures are the problem to be proven. So the Assumption part would be the definitions of R⁺ and R⁻, and the Problem is to prove equations 3,4,5.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer, which was part of the original problem. But in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but that's incorrect because the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. Wait, the example given by the user might have a mistake. Let me check.\n\nIn the example, the original problem is: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are n is integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems wrong. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include divisibility by 7. So maybe the example is incorrect. But maybe the user intended to filter unrelated info and structure it with necessary assumptions. However, if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the example includes \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not part of the original problem. That seems like an error.\n\nSo perhaps there's a mistake in the example provided, and I should be cautious. But given that the user provided that example, I need to follow it. However, in the current problem, the user on Math Stack Exchange is defining R⁺ and R⁻ with those integrals and conjecturing the three equations. The assumptions should be the definitions of R⁺ and R⁻, each as their own line, and then the problem is to prove the three conjectured equations. So:\n\nAssumption:\nR⁺ is equal to (2/π) times the integral from 0 to π/2 of the eighth root of (x² + ln²cosx) multiplied by the square root expression given,\n\nR⁻ is equal to (2/π) times the integral from 0 to π/2 of the reciprocal of the eighth root of (x² + ln²cosx) multiplied by the same square root expression,\n\nProblem:\nProve that R⁺R⁻ = 1, R⁺ = fourth root of ln2, and R⁻ = reciprocal of fourth root of ln2.\n\nBut the user's example broke down assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one property. So perhaps each integral's definition is split into components. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral for R⁺ is computed from 0 to π/2,\n\nThe integrand of R⁺ includes the eighth root of (x² + ln²cosx),\n\nThe integrand of R⁺ includes the square root expression with nested square roots,\n\nR⁺ is multiplied by 2/π,\n\nSimilarly for R⁻,\n\nBut that might be too detailed. Alternatively, since each integral is a single definition, perhaps each is an assumption. So two assumptions for R⁺ and R⁻. Then the problem is the three conjectures. So, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nR⁺ is defined as (2/π) ∫₀^{π/2} [ (x² + ln²cosx)^{1/8} * sqrt(1/2 + (1/2)sqrt(1/2 + (1/2)sqrt(ln²cosx/(x² + ln²cosx))) ] dx,\n\nR⁻ is defined as (2/π) ∫₀^{π/2} [ 1/(x² + ln²cosx)^{1/8} * sqrt(1/2 + (1/2)sqrt(1/2 + (1/2)sqrt(ln²cosx/(x² + ln²cosx))) ] dx,\n\nProblem:\nProve that R⁺R⁻ = 1, R⁺ = ∜(ln2), and R⁻ = 1/∜(ln2).\n\nThat seems to fit the structure. The original problem mentions that these are called Ramanujan log-trigonometric integrals on MathWorld, but that's probably extra info not needed in the formatted problem. So I'll omit that.",
