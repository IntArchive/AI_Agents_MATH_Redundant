    "Content": "This is a kind of \"prove or give a counter-example\" question, and I'm having some difficults with it: By a maximal ideal $I$ of an algebra $A$, we mean an ideal $I\\neq A$ which is not properly contained in any other proper ideal of $A$ (possibly, $I=\\left\\{0\\right\\}$. Let's write $\\mathbf{1}$ for the unit of $A$ (if it exists). Question . Let $A$ be a unital commutative Banach Algebra and $I$ a maximal ideal of $A$. Prove that $I$ is a maximal subspace of $A$. Is this result still valid if $A$ is not Banach or commutative or unital? The first part is pretty easy: Maximal ideals are of the form $\\ker\\tau$ for some character $\\tau:A\\to\\mathbb{C}$, and then $A=\\ker\\tau+\\mathbb{C}\\mathbf{1}$, so $\\ker\\tau$ is a maximal subspace. If $A$ is not commutative, we have a counter-example: The algebra $M_2(\\mathbb{C})$ is simple, so the unique maximal ideal of $M_2(\\mathbb{C})$ is $\\left\\{0\\right\\}$, which is not a maximal subspace. I couldn't solve the rest of the question: If $A$ is Banach and commutative but non-unital, maybe I could consider its unitization and associate maximal ideals of $A$ and $\\widetilde{A}$, but I couldn't do that. The only example of commutative, unital, non-Banach normed algebra I can think of is $\\mathbb{C}[x]$, the polynomial algebra in one variable (with any of the usual norms), but the only maximal ideals of $\\mathbb{C}[x]$ are of the form $p(x)\\mathbb{C}[x]$ with $\\operatorname{degree}(p)=1$, and these are maximal subspaces. Any hints are appreciated. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Of course the result is not valid if we drop commutativity. For instance the algebra of all bounded operators on $\\ell_2$ can serve as a counterexample. Concerning having a unit, Maximal ideals of commutative Banach algebras have codimension one. Here is a proof under an extra assumption that a maximal ideal is closed. According to Gamelin Th. Gamelin, Uniform Algebras , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N. J., 1969. p. 22, closed maximal non-modular ideals are precisely those subspaces of codimension 1 which contain the linear span of all $xy$ where $x,y\\in A$ (let us denote this set by $A\\cdot A$). Indeed, a proper closed ideal $J$ is modular if and only if $A\\cdot A\\not\\subseteq J$. Note that any subspace $M$ containing $A\\cdot A$ is an ideal, so $M$ is a closed maximal ideal if and only if it has codimension 1. Since maximal modular ideals are kernels of characters the result follows. The case where $M$ is not closed. ( Edit 19.08.2014 ) H. Garth Dales , basing on some observations from this discussion managed to answer the question in the remaining case where the maximal ideal is not closed. He kindly uploaded his answer to the arXiv, so that you can find it here . Non-complete algebras . There exist non-complete, commutative and unital normed algebras with maximal ideals having infinite codimension, though. For instance the algebra of all entire functions on the complex plane endowed with the sup norm on the closed unit disc is such an example. (I learnt this example from H. G. Dales.) To see this, endow this algebra with (non-normable) topology by specifying a family of semi-norms: $$p_r(f) = \\sup_{|z|\\leqslant r}|f(z)|\\;\\;\\;(r>0).$$ Now, take the ideal $$J = \\{f\\mbox{ entire}\\colon (\\exists{n_0\\in \\mathbb{N}})(\\forall n\\geqslant n_0) (f(n)=0)\\}.$$ This is a proper ideal not contained in the kernel of any point evaluation. One can prove that kernels of point evaluations are the only maximal ideals which are closed in this topology. Since this algebra is unital, $J$ has to be contained in some dense maximal ideal $M$. Consequently, $M$ has infinite codimension.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about maximal ideals in various types of algebras and whether they are maximal subspaces. The original question has a few parts. First, they want to prove that in a unital commutative Banach algebra, a maximal ideal is a maximal subspace. Then, they're asking if this holds when the algebra isn't Banach, commutative, or unital. They provided a counterexample for the non-commutative case with M2(C). For the other cases, they're stuck.\n\nSo, the user wants the problem structured into Assumptions and Problem. Let me see the example they gave. The example took the original problem, listed assumptions (n is an integer, divisible by 7), then the problem. Here, the assumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem here: The main part is the first question. The assumptions for that would be that A is a unital commutative Banach algebra, and I is a maximal ideal. The problem is to prove I is a maximal subspace. Then, the second part is whether the result holds if A is not Banach, commutative, or unital. So maybe each of these cases should be separate problems with their own assumptions?\n\nBut the example given in the original query splits the problem into parts with different assumptions. For instance, in the example, the assumption was n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the first problem has assumptions: A is a unital commutative Banach algebra, I is a maximal ideal. The problem is to prove I is a maximal subspace. Then, the second problem is to determine if the result holds when A is not Banach, not commutative, or not unital. However, the user already provided a counterexample for non-commutative (M2(C)), so maybe the problem is about the other cases: non-Banach or non-unital.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Is this result still valid if A is not Banach or commutative or unital?\" So the problem is two-fold. The first part is under the assumptions of unital, commutative, Banach. The second part is asking whether the conclusion holds if any of those conditions are dropped. So the user needs to structure each part with respective assumptions.\n\nBut according to the format, each problem should have its own assumptions. So maybe the first problem is the initial proof, then the second problem is checking the cases where each condition is removed. But how to structure this?\n\nIn the example, the user structured the problem by listing the assumptions (each as one line) and then the problem. So here, the first problem would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\n- I is a maximal ideal of A.\n\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nThen, the second part would be three separate problems? Or maybe one problem with three cases. But the original question is phrased as \"Is this result still valid if A is not Banach or commutative or unital?\" So maybe each condition (Banach, commutative, unital) is a separate case. So for each of these, the problem is to determine if the result holds when that condition is not met. However, the user already provided a counterexample for non-commutative. So perhaps the problem includes those cases.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is asking for the rest of the question: If A is Banach and commutative but non-unital, and another case where A is commutative, unital, non-Banach. So perhaps the problem is split into three parts: non-Banach, non-commutative, non-unital. But in the problem statement, the user mentions \"if A is not Banach or commutative or unital\". So the three possibilities: not Banach, not commutative, not unital. Each is a case. The user already handled non-commutative. The remaining are non-Banach and non-unital.\n\nSo for the problem structure, the first part is under the assumptions that A is unital, commutative, Banach. The second part is the problem of whether the result holds when A is not Banach, not commutative, or not unital. However, the user wants the problem structured as per the example. So perhaps the problem statement is split into two parts: the first part with the initial assumptions, and the second part as a question about the other cases. But in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that I is a maximal subspace... Is this result still valid...\", so maybe the problem is two separate questions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be presented as:\n\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Is this result still valid if A is not Banach, commutative, or unital?\n\nBut according to the format, we need to list assumptions and the problem. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nFor the first part:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\n- I is a maximal ideal of A.\n\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nFor the second part, which is three separate cases, each would need their own assumptions. However, since the user is asking whether the result is still valid in each case, we need to structure each case as a separate problem. But the example only had one problem. The user might need to have each case as a different problem. But maybe the user wants all in one problem. Alternatively, since the second part is a follow-up question, maybe it's included as part of the same problem but with different assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the second part can be phrased as three separate problems:\n\nProblem 1: (Original)\nAssumptions: A is a unital commutative Banach algebra, I is a maximal ideal.\nProblem: Prove I is a maximal subspace.\n\nProblem 2: If A is not Banach (but commutative and unital), is I a maximal subspace?\n\nProblem 3: If A is not commutative (but Banach and unital), is I a maximal subspace? (Already answered with counterexample)\n\nProblem 4: If A is not unital (but Banach and commutative), is I a maximal subspace?\n\nBut the user's original problem statement mentions \"if A is not Banach or commutative or unital\". So maybe each of those three conditions is a separate assumption to check. However, the user already provided the non-commutative case. The user's problem is about the remaining cases: non-Banach and non-unital. So perhaps the problem is split into:\n\nFirst problem: Under the given assumptions, prove I is a maximal subspace.\n\nSecond problem: Determine if the conclusion holds when A is not Banach (but still commutative and unital? Or commutative but possibly non-unital? Wait, the problem says \"if A is not Banach or commutative or unital\". So each condition is removed one by one. So for each of the three conditions (Banach, commutative, unital), remove one and see if the conclusion holds.\n\nBut the way the original problem is written, the second part is asking whether the result is valid if A is not Banach, or not commutative, or not unital. So for each of these three cases, we need to check. So the problem is split into four parts? Or two parts: prove under certain conditions, then check the three other cases.\n\nBut according to the format given, each problem has its own assumptions and problem. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\n- I is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nThen, another problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a commutative Banach algebra,\n- A is not unital,\n- I is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Is I a maximal subspace of A?\n\nAnother problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a unital Banach algebra,\n- A is not commutative,\n- I is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Is I a maximal subspace of A?\n\nAnother problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a unital commutative algebra,\n- A is not a Banach algebra,\n- I is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Is I a maximal subspace of A?\n\nBut in the original problem, the user says \"the rest of the question\" refers to the non-Banach or non-unital cases. But maybe the way to structure this is to have the main problem with the initial assumptions, then the second problem as a general question about the other cases. However, the format requires each problem to have its own assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem is presented as a single question with two parts, the user might need to split them into two separate entries. But given the example, perhaps it's better to structure the first part as per the initial assumptions, then the second part as a separate problem with different assumptions.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe the correct approach is:\n\nOriginal problem has two main parts:\n\n1. Prove that in a unital commutative Banach algebra, a maximal ideal is a maximal subspace.\n\n2. Determine if the result holds when A is not Banach, commutative, or unital.\n\nBut part 2 is three separate cases. However, the user has already given a counterexample for non-commutative. So perhaps the remaining cases are non-Banach and non-unital. Therefore, the problem would be split into:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\n- I is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a commutative Banach algebra,\n- A is not unital,\n- I is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Is I a maximal subspace of A?\n\nThird problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a unital commutative algebra,\n- A is not a Banach algebra,\n- I is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Is I a maximal subspace of A?\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentions \"the rest of the question\", which includes these cases. However, given the format example, perhaps the main problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Determine if this result holds when A is not Banach, commutative, or unital.\n\nBut the example had a single problem with assumptions. The example had n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So the assumptions were two separate lines. So perhaps here, the problem is to present the first part with its assumptions, and the second part as separate problems. But the user might need to combine them into one problem, but the second part is three different scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, since the user mentioned \"Is this result still valid if A is not Banach or commutative or unital?\" as the second part, perhaps the problem is split into two parts with different assumptions. But according to the format, each problem must have its own assumptions and problem. Therefore, the user needs to split the original question into separate problems.\n\nHowever, given the user's example, the original problem's first part is structured with its assumptions and problem, and the second part is perhaps left as a separate problem. But since the user might need to fit it into the given format, perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Determine if the conclusion remains valid when A is not Banach, commutative, or unital.\n\nBut the example has the problem as a single statement. So perhaps the user's answer should list the assumptions for the first part and then the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, since the second part is a separate question, but under different assumptions, maybe we need to list all possible cases in the assumptions. However, that might not be possible.\n\nGiven the example, the problem in the example was written as:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo here, the assumptions are the conditions, and the problem is the task. In the current case, the first part's assumptions are clear. The second part is a question of validity under different conditions. However, since the second part is not a single set of assumptions but three different cases, perhaps it's best to include the first part as the main problem and note the second part as a follow-up. But according to the user's instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the example. Therefore, perhaps the answer should be:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Determine if this result holds if A is not Banach, commutative, or unital.\n\nBut the problem mentions three separate cases, which might not all be covered by a single assumption. However, since the format requires each assumption to address one property applied to one object, perhaps the second part's problem is separate but the user hasn't structured it yet. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as two separate entries.\n\nBut considering the original problem was presented as one question with two parts, and the example only structured the first part, perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nThen, for the second part:\n\nAssumption: \nA is not Banach, commutative, or unital,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Determine if I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nBut that might not be precise, since the three conditions (not Banach, not commutative, not unital) are separate. Each should be their own assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants each of the three cases as separate problems. But since the example had one problem with two assumptions, perhaps the answer is to list all assumptions for each case. However, it's unclear. The user might need to structure the problem as per the original question's phrasing.\n\nGiven the user's original problem statement:\n\n\"Question. Let A be a unital commutative Banach Algebra and I a maximal ideal of A. Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Is this result still valid if A is not Banach or commutative or unital?\"\n\nSo the problem is two-fold:\n\n1. Prove under given conditions.\n\n2. Check validity when any of the three conditions are removed.\n\nSo perhaps, following the example, the formatted problem should list the initial assumptions and the problem as the first part. Then, the second part would be another problem with different assumptions. But since the second part is three cases, it's not straightforward. However, given the example, perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Is this result still valid if A is not Banach, commutative, or unital?\n\nBut the problem part includes both the prove and the question. However, the example's problem part was only the prove statement. To adhere to the format, maybe the problem part should only state the task. So maybe:\n\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Determine the validity of this result when A is not Banach, commutative, or unital.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem is a single statement. The example's problem was a single statement: \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nAssumption: \nA is an algebra that is not Banach, commutative, or unital,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Determine if I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nBut the second part's assumptions are a bit vague. The original question is about each individual condition being removed. So the user needs to structure each case separately. For example:\n\nFor the non-Banach case:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative algebra (not Banach),\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Determine if I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nFor the non-commutative case:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital Banach algebra (not commutative),\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Determine if I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nFor the non-unital case:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a commutative Banach algebra (not unital),\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Determine if I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nBut since the user already provided a counterexample for the non-commutative case (M2(C)), maybe that is excluded. However, the original problem still includes it. So perhaps all three cases are part of the problem.\n\nBut given the format example, the user expects each problem to have assumptions and problem. Since the original problem is split into two parts, the first with initial assumptions and the second as a general question about other cases, perhaps the formatted problem is as follows:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nAssumption: \nA is not a Banach algebra,\nA is commutative,\nA is unital,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Determine if I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nAssumption: \nA is a Banach algebra,\nA is not commutative,\nA is unital,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Determine if I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nAssumption: \nA is a commutative Banach algebra,\nA is not unital,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Determine if I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nBut this seems too fragmented. The original problem is one question with two parts. Given the user's example, which combined the assumptions and problem into one, perhaps the answer should be:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nAssumption: \nA is an algebra where at least one of the conditions (Banach, commutative, unital) is not satisfied,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Determine if I is a maximal subspace of A.\n\nBut this is too vague. The problem requires specific cases. However, given the user's example, maybe the answer should capture the original problem as is, splitting into two parts. The first part is proving under certain conditions, the second is checking in other cases. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Determine if this result holds when A is not Banach, commutative, or unital.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is a single statement. So perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A and determine the validity if A is not Banach, commutative, or unital.\n\nBut the example didn't have multiple parts. The example's problem was a single \"Prove that...\". So maybe the answer is:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Is this result still valid if A is not Banach, commutative, or unital?\n\nBut the problem includes two tasks: prove and determine validity. However, the example only had one task. To adhere strictly to the format, maybe the problem should be structured as two separate entries. However, the user's original question includes both parts. Since the user's example formatted the original problem into one assumption and one problem, perhaps we have to combine them.\n\nBut since the user's example only had one problem statement, perhaps we need to follow that. Hence:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Determine if the result holds when A is not Banach, commutative, or unital.\n\nBut this combines two tasks. However, given the format's example, which had only the problem statement, perhaps this is acceptable. The key is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property of one object, then the problem statement.\n\nThe user's original problem includes two parts: proving under certain conditions and checking in other cases. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nA is a unital commutative Banach algebra,\nI is a maximal ideal of A.\nProblem: Prove that I is a maximal subspace of A. Determine if this result is still valid if A is not Banach, commutative, or unital.\n\nThis captures both parts. The assumptions are listed for the first part, and the problem includes both tasks. While the example had a single task, the user's original problem includes both, so it's necessary to include both in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be structured as such.",
