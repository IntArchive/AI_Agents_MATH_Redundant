    "Content": "Can someone explain to me why this does not constitute a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, please? Basically, using something I've read online, it appears you can write an equation for $(a, b, c)$ to find solutions for equations $a^n + b^n = c^n$ in the form of\n$$a = (u^2 - v^2)^{2/n}, \\: b = (2uv)^{2/n},\\: c = (u^2 + v^2)^{2/n}$$ which won't produce integer solutions for $n > 2$. Could someone explain to me the mistake in this \" proof \" please? The full work is here (there's no downloading required because it's just a PDF). Thanks in advance",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The argument seems to implicitly assume that $u$ and $v$ are integers.  This assumption is not justified, as explained below.  But even accepting this assumption, there is a fatal flaw in the final step of the argument.  The argument given is that $b$ cannot be an integer if $n>2$, because of the irrational factor $2^{2/n}$ appearing in the expression $b=(2uv)^{2/n}$.  However, this factor might combine with irrational parts of $u^{2/n}$ and $v^{2/n}$ to produce an integer.  For instance, take $n=3$, $u=4$, and $v=1$. Moreover, the argument never actually defines exactly what $u$ and $v$ are.  Instead, it defines $$k=\\frac{y^{n/2}}{1+x^{n/2}}$$ and later writes $k=\\frac{u}{v}$.  So in order to be able to choose $u$ and $v$ to be integers, you would need to know $k$ is rational.  From the definition of $k$, there is no reason to expect it to be rational if $n$ is odd, since its definition involves taking square roots of $x$ and $y$.  There is no problem if $n$ is even, but the issue raised in the previous paragraph is still a problem then.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking why a certain approach doesn't constitute a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. The approach involves expressing a, b, c in terms of u and v raised to the power of 2/n, and then claiming that these won't produce integer solutions for n > 2.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions here. The user mentions that they found an equation where a, b, c are written as (u² - v²)^{2/n}, (2uv)^{2/n}, and (u² + v²)^{2/n}. The argument is that these expressions won't yield integers for n > 2. So, the assumptions here are about the form of a, b, c. \n\nEach assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So, for each variable a, b, c, they are defined in terms of u and v with exponents 2/n. Also, the problem states that these expressions don't produce integer solutions when n > 2. The original Fermat's Last Theorem says there are no positive integer solutions for a^n + b^n = c^n when n > 2. \n\nSo, listing the assumptions: each of a, b, c is defined with those expressions, and n is greater than 2. However, the original problem's assumption might also include that u and v are integers, because otherwise the expressions could be any real numbers. The user's \"proof\" probably assumes u and v are integers, leading to a, b, c being non-integers. But maybe the flaw is that even if a, b, c are expressed that way, they could still be integers for some u, v, n. Or perhaps the mistake is in assuming that all solutions must come from that parameterization, which might not be the case.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. a is defined as (u² - v²)^{2/n}\n2. b is defined as (2uv)^{2/n}\n3. c is defined as (u² + v²)^{2/n}\n4. u and v are integers (assuming that from the context, since the user is talking about integer solutions)\n5. n is an integer greater than 2\n\nBut wait, the problem as stated in the question is that the user's approach claims these expressions don't produce integer solutions, hence the \"proof\" is incorrect. The actual mistake might be that the parameterization is not general enough or that even with these forms, a, b, c could still be integers. So, perhaps the assumption is that all solutions must take this form, which is not necessarily true. But the user is presenting this as a proof, so the key assumptions are the expressions for a, b, c and n > 2.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\na is expressed as (u² - v²)^{2/n},\nb is expressed as (2uv)^{2/n},\nc is expressed as (u² + v²)^{2/n},\nn is an integer greater than 2,\nu and v are integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the equation aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ has no integer solutions for n > 2.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is the user's \"proof\" claims that these expressions won't produce integer solutions, and the user is asking why this doesn't work. So the problem as presented in the question is that using these expressions, the user concludes no integer solutions, but this isn't a valid proof. Therefore, the problem statement here would be to explain why this approach fails, but according to the user's format, we need to structure the problem part as the problem they are presenting. However, in the example given, the problem was to prove divisibility, so maybe here the problem is to show that aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ has no integer solutions under the given parameterization. But the actual issue is that the user's approach is incorrect, but the structured problem would capture the original assertion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as phrased by the user is: \"Prove that the parameterization a = ..., b = ..., c = ... does not yield integer solutions for n > 2.\" But the user is asking why this isn't a valid proof of FLT. So, the problem would be the user's claim, and the assumptions would be the parameterization and n > 2. However, FLT states that there are no solutions at all, not just in this parameterization. Therefore, the mistake is assuming that all solutions must come from this parameterization. But in terms of formatting, the user wants to structure the problem as presented in the \"proof\", so the assumptions would be the expressions for a, b, c, and n > 2, and the problem is that these don't yield integer solutions. The actual FLT problem is broader, so the user's approach is incomplete.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the parameterization and n > 2, and the problem is to show that these a, b, c aren't integers. But the user's \"proof\" is incorrect because maybe they can be integers under some conditions. Alternatively, even if they aren't, it doesn't cover all possible solutions. So the problem as structured would be the assertion in the \"proof\", and the assumptions are the parameterization and n > 2.\n\nSo, to structure it:\n\nAssumption:\na is defined as (u² - v²)^{2/n},\nb is defined as (2uv)^{2/n},\nc is defined as (u² + v²)^{2/n},\nn is an integer greater than 2,\nu and v are integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ has no integer solutions.\n\nBut the user's question is why this approach doesn't work. Therefore, the problem as presented by the user is claiming that this parameterization doesn't give integer solutions, hence FLT is proven. The mistake is that this doesn't cover all possible solutions, or perhaps the parameterization itself can yield integer solutions for certain u, v, n. For example, if n=2, this is the standard Pythagorean triple parameterization. For n>2, maybe even with exponents 2/n, there could exist u and v such that a, b, c are integers, but the user's \"proof\" assumes they can't. Alternatively, the expressions might not even be integers, but the \"proof\" fails to show that.\n\nSo, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the parameterization and n>2. The problem is to prove that there are no integer solutions. The actual issue is that the parameterization might not capture all possible solutions, hence even if this parameterization doesn't yield solutions, others might. But according to the user's original problem statement, the problem is structured as per their \"proof\" which uses this parameterization.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should list the assumptions about the definitions of a, b, c in terms of u, v, and n>2, and the problem is to prove that aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ has no integer solutions. However, the actual answer would point out that this parameterization doesn't cover all possible solutions, hence even if this form doesn't yield solutions, others might. But for the purpose of the format, we just structure the problem as presented.",
