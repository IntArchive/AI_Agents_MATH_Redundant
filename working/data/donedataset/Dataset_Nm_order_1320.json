    "Content": "A point $p$ in a metric space $X$ is a boundary point of the set $A$, if any neighbourhood of $p$ has points of both $A$ and $X-A$.Prove that the set of all boundary points of $A$ is closed. My attempt:\nBy definition of an open set this means that for every $x$ in the boundary there is an open ball centred at $x$ contained in the boundary. An open ball is a neighbourhood of $x$, which implies it contains points of $A$ and $X - A$, which in turn implies there are points in both $A$ and $X - A$ that are in the boundary of $A$. If $A$ is open, then pick any such point in $A$ that is also in the boundary. This point cannot be in $X - A$ by definition of set subtraction. Further, because $A$ is open there exists an open ball centred around this point contained in $A$. Again, an open ball is a neighbourhood, which means a neighborhood of this point does not contain points of $X - A$, implying it cannot be in the boundary, a contradiction. If A is closed then $X - A$ is open and a symmetric argument holds. Hence the boundary is closed. Is my work correct?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The boundary of a set $A$ is defined as $\\overline{A} \\cap \\overline{X - A}$. It is the intersection of two closed sets and hence is closed. By the way your proof is not correct because you assumed that $A$ is either open or closed. There are sets like $(0,1] \\subset \\Bbb{R}$ in the usual topology that are neither open nor closed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure their problem according to a specific format. The original question is about proving that the set of all boundary points of a set A in a metric space X is closed. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and filter out any unrelated information. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement was presented clearly.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question: The title is \"The boundary is a closed set\". The question starts by defining a boundary point: a point p in metric space X is a boundary point of A if every neighborhood of p contains points of both A and X - A. The task is to prove that the set of all boundary points of A (denoted as boundary of A) is closed. The user's attempt involves using open sets and neighborhoods, discussing cases where A is open or closed, leading to a contradiction. They ask if their work is correct.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The assumptions should list each condition. In this problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a metric space.\n2. A is a subset of X.\n3. A point p is a boundary point of A if every neighborhood of p contains points of both A and X - A.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem statement is to prove that the set of boundary points of A is closed.\n\nWait, the original problem statement as given by the user doesn't explicitly state that X is a metric space in the problem part. Wait, in the question, the user says \"A point p in a metric space X...\", so the assumption here is that X is a metric space, which is important because the definition of neighborhoods and closed sets can vary depending on the space. So that's a key assumption.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove the set of all boundary points is closed. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions: X is a metric space, A is a subset of X, and the definition of a boundary point. Then the problem is to prove the boundary is closed.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on n, like being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are more about the setting: the space is metric, A is a subset, and the definition of boundary points.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is a metric space,\n- A is a subset of X,\n- A point p is a boundary point of A if every neighborhood of p contains points of both A and X - A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set of all boundary points of A is closed.\n\nNow, checking if each assumption is one property per line. The first line states X is a metric space. The second line is A being a subset. Third line defines boundary points. Each is a separate condition. The problem is to prove the boundary is closed.\n\nThe user's original attempt might have some errors, but the task here is just to structure the problem, not evaluate the attempt. So the formatted problem should capture the essential assumptions and the problem statement as per the given example.",
