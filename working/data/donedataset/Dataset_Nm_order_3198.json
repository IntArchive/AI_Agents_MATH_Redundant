    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure it into Assumptions and Problem sections based on the example provided.\n\nFirst, the original question is about integrals of the Bessel function J0(x) between its zeros. The title mentions \"integrals of the Bessel function J0(x) over the intervals between its zeros.\" The user defines J0(x) as the Bessel function of the first kind, which has an infinite number of zeros on the positive real semi-axis, denoted as j_{0,n} with examples given. Then they define sigma_n as (-1)^n times the integral of J0(x) from j_{0,n} to j_{0,n+1}. The problem is about finding the asymptotic behavior of sigma_n, specifically whether the given asymptotic expansion (equation 4) can be proven and if further coefficients can be found.\n\nSo, I need to list the assumptions. The assumptions are the properties and conditions given. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. J0(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind. That's a key property of the function involved.\n2. J0(x) has an infinite number of zeros on the positive real semi-axis. This is an important condition about the zeros of the function.\n3. The zeros are denoted as j_{0,n}, ordered increasingly (implicitly, since they talk about consecutive zeros). So each j_{0,n} is a zero of J0(x) and they are ordered such that j_{0,n} < j_{0,n+1}.\n4. sigma_n is defined as (-1)^n times the integral of J0(x) from j_{0,n} to j_{0,n+1}. So this defines the sequence whose asymptotic behavior is in question.\n5. The problem is about proving the asymptotic expansion given in equation (4) and finding the next coefficients. So the problem statement would be to prove the asymptotic formula and determine further coefficients.\n\nWait, the assumptions should each address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- $J_0(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind.\n- $J_0(x)$ has an infinite number of zeros on the positive real semi-axis.\n- The zeros of $J_0(x)$ are denoted as $j_{0,n}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.\n- The sequence $j_{0,n}$ is ordered such that $j_{0,n} < j_{0,n+1}$ for all positive integers $n$.\n- The integral $\\sigma_n$ is defined as $(-1)^n \\int_{j_{0,n}}^{j_{0,n+1}} J_0(x)\\,dx$.\n- The asymptotic behavior of $\\sigma_n$ is to be studied.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption for the original problem was:\n\nAssumption: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user had a wrong assumption (they included \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem, but the correct formatted problem didn't include that. Wait, looking back: the example given was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7. But that's incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example was wrong, but according to the user's example, the assumptions are the conditions given. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\", but the correct problem didn't have that. So maybe the user made an error in the example. However, I need to follow the format as per the example. So in the example, the formatted problem included assumptions even if they were incorrect. Wait, but perhaps in the example, the user intended to show that assumptions should be listed as per the problem, but maybe they made a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. But maybe I need to follow the user's example structure, which lists assumptions from the problem. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the user thought that divisibility by 7 is required, but actually, the problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer. The formatted problem example's assumption seems incorrect. But perhaps I should proceed as per the user's instruction, which in the example included an extra assumption. But maybe the user intended to list all conditions given. Hmm, confusing. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem as presented.\n\nLooking at the current problem:\n\nTitle: Integrals of the Bessel function J0(x) over the intervals between its zeros\n\nQuestion content:\n\n- J0(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind.\n- It has infinite zeros on the positive real semi-axis, denoted j_{0,n} with examples.\n- sigma_n is defined as (-1)^n times the integral from j_{0,n} to j_{0,n+1} of J0(x) dx.\n- They observe an asymptotic expansion for sigma_n and want to prove it and find next coefficients.\n\nAssumptions should list each condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- $J_0(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind.\n- $J_0(x)$ has an infinite number of zeros on the positive real semi-axis.\n- The zeros of $J_0(x)$ are denoted by $j_{0,n}$ for positive integers $n$.\n- The sequence $j_{0,n}$ is ordered such that $j_{0,n} < j_{0,n+1}$.\n- $\\sigma_n$ is defined as $(-1)^n \\int_{j_{0,n}}^{j_{0,n+1}} J_0(x)\\,dx$.\n- The asymptotic behavior of $\\sigma_n$ as $n$ becomes large is considered.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each bullet point should be a single assumption. For example, \"J0(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind\" is one assumption. The infinite zeros is another. The notation j_{0,n} is another. The ordering of j_{0,n} is another. The definition of sigma_n is another. And considering asymptotic behavior is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nWait, the problem is about the asymptotic behavior. So the problem is to prove the given asymptotic expansion and find next coefficients. The assumptions are the given conditions and properties. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- $J_0(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind.\n- $J_0(x)$ has an infinite number of zeros on the positive real semi-axis.\n- The zeros of $J_0(x)$ are denoted as $j_{0,n}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.\n- For each positive integer $n$, $j_{0,n} < j_{0,n+1}$.\n- The integral $\\sigma_n$ is defined as $(-1)^n \\int_{j_{0,n}}^{j_{0,n+1}} J_0(x)\\,dx$.\n- The sequence $\\sigma_n$ has the values given (but maybe that's part of the problem data, not an assumption?).\n\nBut the problem is asking about the asymptotic behavior of sigma_n. The empirical observation is part of the problem motivation, but the actual problem is to prove the asymptotic expansion and find next coefficients. So the assumptions are the conditions given, not the observations.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- $J_0(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind.\n- $J_0(x)$ has an infinite number of zeros on the positive real semi-axis.\n- The zeros of $J_0(x)$ are denoted as $j_{0,n}$ for positive integers $n$.\n- The zeros are ordered such that $j_{0,n} < j_{0,n+1}$ for all positive integers $n$.\n- $\\sigma_n$ is defined as $(-1)^n \\int_{j_{0,n}}^{j_{0,n+1}} J_0(x)\\,dx$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the asymptotic behavior of $\\sigma_n$ is given by $$\\sigma_n\\,\\stackrel{\\color{#a0a0a0}?}\\sim\\,\\frac{2\\sqrt2}{\\pi\\sqrt n}\\left(1-\\frac1{8n}+O\\!\\left(\\frac1{n^2}\\right)\\right)\\!$$ and find the next coefficients in this expansion.\n\nBut in the example, the problem line just states the problem as given. So I need to ensure that each assumption is only one line, one property, one object. For instance, \"J0(x) is Bessel function of first kind\" is one assumption. \"Has infinite zeros on positive real semi-axis\" is another. \"Zeros denoted j_{0,n}\" another. \"Zeros ordered increasingly\" another. \"sigma_n is defined as integral with (-1)^n\" another.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $J_0(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind.\n- $J_0(x)$ has an infinite number of zeros on the positive real semi-axis.\n- The zeros of $J_0(x)$ are denoted as $j_{0,n}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.\n- For each positive integer $n$, $j_{0,n} < j_{0,n+1}$.\n- $\\sigma_n$ is defined as $(-1)^n \\int_{j_{0,n}}^{j_{0,n+1}} J_0(x)\\,dx$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the asymptotic behavior of $\\sigma_n$ is given by $$\\sigma_n\\,\\stackrel{\\color{#a0a0a0}?}\\sim\\,\\frac{2\\sqrt2}{\\pi\\sqrt n}\\left(1-\\frac1{8n}+O\\!\\left(\\frac1{n^2}\\right)\\right)\\!$$ and find the next coefficients in this expansion.\n\nBut in the example, the problem line includes the expression to be proven. So that's correct. Also, the problem includes two parts: prove the asymptotic and find next coefficients.\n\nSo the final answer should be structured as per the format, with assumptions listed line by line, each with one property, and then the problem statement.",
