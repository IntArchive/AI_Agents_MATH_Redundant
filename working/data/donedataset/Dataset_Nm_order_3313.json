    "Content": "I've been struggling with this for a while, and I have a couple of leads that kind of got me nowhere: At first I thought that if $f$ is continuous somewhere then the integral will be $>0$. So, if the integral was $0$ then that would mean it would need to be nowhere continuous. That seemed unlikely to me, but I couldn't prove the existence of a point at which it is continuous. For the integral to be $0$ it would necessitate that for any sub interval of $[a,b]$ the function's infimum would have to be $0$. Also seems weird for $f>0$. Again, got me nowhere. I should mention that I'm aware that it's possible to prove this by defining \"Measure\" and all that, but I don't want to go there. I'm wondering if there are more elementary tools to show the above. Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Sketch: For a bounded function $f$, we define the oscillation of $f$ at $a$ by $$\\mathrm{osc}f(a) = \\limsup_{x\\to a} f(x) - \\liminf_{x\\to a} f(x). $$ Then it is easy to show that $f$ is continuous at $a$ if and only if $\\mathrm{osc}f(a) = 0$. Now let us given $\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\delta > 0$. Then we can find a partition $P$ such that $U(f,P)-L(f,P) < \\epsilon$. Thus the set $S = S(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ denotes the collections of subintervals $I$, formed by the points of $P$, where $\\sup_{I} f - \\inf_{I} f > \\delta$ satisfies $$ \\epsilon > U(f,P)-L(f,P) > \\sum_{I\\in S} \\delta |I| $$ Now, choose $(\\epsilon_n, \\delta_n)$ such that $\\delta_n \\downarrow 0$ and $$ l := \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon_n}{\\delta_n} < b-a. $$ Choose $r >1$ such that $rl < b-a$. For each closed interval $I \\in S(\\epsilon_n, \\delta_n)$, we choose an open interval $J$ containing $I$ such that $|J| = r|I|$. Finally, let $\\mathcal{U}$ be the family formed by collecting all such open intervals $J$. If $f$ has no point of continuity, then each $x \\in [a, b]$ is a point where $f$ has positive oscillation and hence lies in some $J\\in \\mathcal{U}$. Thus $\\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $[a,b]$, and hence it has a finite subcover. But the sum of the length of the open intervals in that subcover cannot exceed $rl < b-a$, a contradiction! Therefore $f$ must have a point of continuity. Of course, this proof also hides the idea of measure, though indirectly and elusively.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that if a function f is Riemann integrable on [a, b] and f is greater than 0 everywhere on that interval, then the integral of f over [a, b] is greater than 0. And they want to do this without using measure theory, so I need to stick to basic analysis or Riemann integral properties.\n\nFirst, let's recall some definitions. A function is Riemann integrable if the upper and lower integrals are equal. The integral being zero would mean that the infimum of the upper sums is zero. But since f is positive everywhere, maybe there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, if f is always positive, then for every x in [a, b], f(x) > 0. So, there must be some minimum value. But wait, f might not attain its minimum. For example, f could be 1/n on intervals shrinking around a point. But no, f is positive everywhere, so maybe there's a lower bound? Hmm, not necessarily. For example, f(x) = x on (0,1], but defined at 0 as 1. Then f is positive everywhere, but infimum is 0. So that's a case where the infimum on the interval is zero even though f is always positive.\n\nBut in that case, if the function is integrable and the integral is zero, how does that happen? Wait, but in that example, the integral of x from 0 to 1 is 1/2, which is positive. So even if the infimum is zero, the integral can still be positive. So maybe the key is that if f is integrable and the integral is zero, then f must be zero almost everywhere (but in measure theory terms). But the user wants to avoid measure theory.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of partitions. If the integral is zero, then for any epsilon, there exists a partition where the upper sum is less than epsilon. Since f > 0 everywhere, each subinterval should contribute some positive amount to the upper sum. Wait, but maybe not? For example, if in every subinterval, the supremum of f is positive, but the sum could still be made small by making the widths of the subintervals where the supremum is large very small. But if f is everywhere positive, maybe there's a point where f is bounded below by some positive number, so that the integral over an interval around that point is positive, and then the rest of the integral is non-negative.\n\nWait, here's an idea: suppose f is Riemann integrable and f > 0 on [a, b]. Then, there exists a point c in [a, b] where f is continuous. If we can show that, then around that point, f is at least f(c)/2 in some neighborhood, and then the integral over that neighborhood would be positive, and the rest of the integral is non-negative, so the total integral is positive. But does a Riemann integrable function have points of continuity? I remember that the set of discontinuities of a Riemann integrable function has measure zero, but again, measure theory is off the table. However, maybe there's a way to show that if f is Riemann integrable and positive, then there must be at least one point of continuity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that if the integral is zero, then the lower integral is also zero (since the function is integrable), so for any partition, the lower sum (which is the sum of infima times widths) is zero. But if the infimum on every subinterval is zero, then how can f be positive everywhere? Wait, if in every subinterval, the infimum of f is zero, then for any x in [a, b], every neighborhood around x contains points where f is arbitrarily close to zero. But f(x) > 0, so maybe this leads to a contradiction. Let's think.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that the integral of f over [a, b] is zero. Since f is Riemann integrable, the upper integral is also zero. Thus, for any epsilon > 0, there exists a partition P such that the upper sum U(P, f) < epsilon. The upper sum is the sum over the partition intervals of (supremum of f on the interval) * (width of interval). If this sum can be made arbitrarily small, then perhaps the supremum of f must be zero on some intervals. But f is positive everywhere, so the supremum on any interval is at least the infimum, which is greater than zero. Wait, no. If f is positive everywhere, then the infimum on any interval is at least zero, but not necessarily positive. For example, f(x) = x on (0,1] has infimum zero on any interval containing zero.\n\nWait, but if the infimum on every subinterval is zero, then f is not bounded below by any positive number. But f is positive everywhere. So, if the lower integral is zero (since the integral is zero), then for any partition, the lower sum is zero. That means that on every subinterval of any partition, the infimum of f is zero. Therefore, for any partition, each subinterval contains points where f is arbitrarily close to zero. But f is positive everywhere, so in every subinterval, there's a point where f is as small as we like. But how does that contradict f being positive everywhere?\n\nWait, maybe use compactness. [a, b] is compact. Suppose for each x in [a, b], f(x) > 0. So, for each x, there exists a neighborhood around x where f is bounded below by some positive number. Because if f is continuous at x, then there's a neighborhood where f is close to f(x) > 0. But f might not be continuous. However, if f is Riemann integrable, then it's continuous almost everywhere (in the measure sense), but we can't use that. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that if the lower integral is zero, then for any partition, the infimum on each subinterval is zero, which would imply that f is zero on a dense set? But f is positive everywhere, so that's impossible. Because if every subinterval contains points where f is less than any epsilon > 0, but f is always positive, but how does that directly lead to a contradiction?\n\nAlternatively, suppose there is a point c where f(c) = m > 0. If f is continuous at c, then there's an interval around c where f(x) > m/2, so the integral over that interval is at least (m/2)*(length of interval) > 0, and the integral over the rest is non-negative, so total integral > 0. But if f is not continuous anywhere, then maybe this approach fails. But Riemann integrable functions must be continuous on a dense set? I'm not sure. Maybe there's a way to show that if f is Riemann integrable and positive everywhere, then there must be a subinterval where f is bounded below by a positive number. Wait, suppose not. Suppose that for every subinterval [c, d] of [a, b], the infimum of f on [c, d] is zero. Then, for any partition, the lower sum is zero. Thus, the lower integral is zero, and since the function is integrable, the integral is zero. But this would imply that the integral is zero, contradicting the fact that f is positive everywhere. Wait, but the conclusion is that if the integral is zero, then such a situation occurs, but we need to show that this situation cannot happen if f is positive everywhere. Maybe that's the contradiction.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Assume f is Riemann integrable on [a, b], f(x) > 0 for all x in [a, b], but the integral of f is zero. Then, since the integral is zero, the lower integral is zero. Therefore, for any partition, the lower sum (which is the sum of infima times widths) is zero. Hence, in every subinterval of any partition, the infimum of f is zero. Therefore, for every interval [c, d] contained in [a, b], the infimum of f on [c, d] is zero. But then, for every x in [a, b], every neighborhood around x contains points where f is arbitrarily close to zero. However, f(x) > 0, so there exists some ε > 0 such that f(x) ≥ ε. But if every neighborhood of x contains points where f is less than ε/2, this contradicts f(x) being ≥ ε at x. Wait, does it? Let's see. Suppose f(x) = ε > 0. If in every neighborhood of x, there's a point y where f(y) < ε/2. Then, can f(x) be ε? Yes, but how does that contradict anything? It doesn't directly. However, if f is Riemann integrable, then the set of points where f is discontinuous is a null set (measure zero), but we can't use that. Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that if every interval has infimum zero, then f cannot be bounded below by any positive number on any interval, so f is not bounded away from zero. But f is positive everywhere. However, the integral being zero would require that for any epsilon, there's a partition where the upper sum is less than epsilon. Which would mean that the supremum on each subinterval times the width is small. But if f is positive everywhere, maybe we can find a finite number of intervals where the supremum is large enough to make the integral positive. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAnother approach: Since f is Riemann integrable, it's bounded. Let M be an upper bound for |f|. Since f > 0, we have 0 < f(x) ≤ M. Now, if the integral is zero, then for any partition, the upper sum can be made arbitrarily small. So for a given epsilon, we can find a partition where the sum of sup f * delta x_i < epsilon. But since f is positive everywhere, each term in the sum is non-negative. Therefore, each sup f on each subinterval must be as small as needed. But if f is bounded below by some positive number on any subinterval, then that term would contribute at least that lower bound times the width. So, if there exists a subinterval where inf f ≥ c > 0, then the integral over that subinterval is ≥ c*(delta x_i), and the total integral would be at least that. Therefore, if the total integral is zero, then there cannot be any subinterval where f is bounded below by a positive number. Hence, in every subinterval, the infimum of f is zero. Therefore, for every interval [c, d] within [a, b], inf_{[c,d]} f = 0. But this implies that f is not bounded below by any positive number on any interval, which contradicts the fact that f is positive everywhere. Wait, how?\n\nWait, if in every interval [c, d], inf f = 0, then for any x in [a, b], any neighborhood around x contains intervals where inf f is zero, so f(x) must be zero? But f(x) > 0. That seems like a contradiction. Wait, take x in [a, b]. Since f(x) > 0, there exists a neighborhood around x where f(y) ≥ f(x)/2 for all y in that neighborhood, if f is continuous at x. But f might not be continuous. However, if every interval around x has infimum zero, then for any δ > 0, there exists y in (x - δ, x + δ) such that f(y) < ε for any ε > 0. But since f(x) > 0, choose ε = f(x)/2. Then there exists y arbitrarily close to x with f(y) < f(x)/2. If this is true for every neighborhood around x, then x is a point of discontinuity of f. But the set of such points would be the entire interval [a, b], which contradicts the fact that a Riemann integrable function must be continuous almost everywhere (but again, measure theory is not allowed). Alternatively, even without measure theory, if every point is a point of discontinuity, then the function is nowhere continuous. However, Riemann integrable functions can have a dense set of discontinuities, but they still have to be \"small\" in some sense. But the user wants to avoid measure theory.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach: Assume ∫_a^b f = 0. Since f ≥ 0, this implies that f(x) = 0 almost everywhere. But since f > 0 everywhere, this is a contradiction. But this uses measure theory. So, we need a more elementary proof.\n\nPerhaps use the fact that if f is Riemann integrable, then there exists a partition such that the upper sum minus lower sum is less than some epsilon. But if the integral is zero, then both upper and lower sums are zero. Therefore, the lower sum is zero, meaning that for some partition, the sum of infima times widths is zero. Hence, each infimum in the partition's subintervals must be zero. Therefore, in each subinterval, there's a point where f is zero. But f > 0 everywhere, contradiction. Wait, but the infimum being zero doesn't imply that there's a point where f is zero, just that there are points where f is arbitrarily close to zero. But since f is positive everywhere, those points have f > 0 but approaching zero. So, no direct contradiction there. But if in every subinterval of the partition, inf f = 0, then for each subinterval, there exists a point where f is as small as we like. But how to use that.\n\nWait, maybe construct a sequence of points where f approaches zero. By compactness, there's a convergent subsequence approaching some point c in [a, b]. Then, by positivity, f(c) > 0. If f were continuous at c, then near c, f is bounded below by f(c)/2, which would contradict the existence of points near c where f is approaching zero. But f might not be continuous at c. However, since f is Riemann integrable, the set of discontinuities has measure zero, but again, measure theory is out.\n\nAlternatively, use that the function is bounded below by some positive number on a closed interval. But if the infimum on every subinterval is zero, then f cannot be bounded below by any positive number on any interval. So, for every interval [c, d], no matter how small, there's a point in [c, d] where f(x) < 1/n for some n. Then, by the extreme value theorem, if f were continuous, it would attain its minimum, but f isn't necessarily continuous.\n\nWait, maybe use the Baire category theorem? The sets F_n = {x | f(x) ≥ 1/n} are closed. Since f > 0 everywhere, the union of F_n covers [a, b]. By Baire category theorem, some F_n has non-empty interior. Hence, there's an interval where f ≥ 1/n, so the integral over that interval is at least (1/n)*(length of interval), hence the total integral is positive. But does this work?\n\nYes! Let's elaborate. Since f(x) > 0 for all x in [a, b], for each x, there exists n such that f(x) ≥ 1/n. Therefore, [a, b] = union of the closed sets F_n = {x | f(x) ≥ 1/n} for n ∈ N. By the Baire category theorem, a complete metric space (like [a, b]) cannot be expressed as a countable union of nowhere dense sets. Therefore, some F_n must be somewhere dense, i.e., contain an interval [c, d]. Hence, on [c, d], f(x) ≥ 1/n. Therefore, the integral over [c, d] is ≥ (d - c)/n > 0, and since f is non-negative elsewhere, the total integral is ≥ (d - c)/n > 0. Therefore, the integral is positive. This avoids measure theory and uses the Baire category theorem, which is part of real analysis. But is the Baire category theorem considered elementary? Maybe, but it's a more advanced topic. However, the user didn't specify excluding Baire, just measure theory.\n\nAlternatively, there's a more elementary approach. Suppose for contradiction that ∫_a^b f = 0. Since f is Riemann integrable, there exists a partition P such that the upper sum U(P, f) < ε for any ε > 0. Choose ε = (b - a) * m, where m is the infimum of f over [a, b]. Wait, but m could be zero. But if we could show that m > 0, then we get a contradiction. However, f might not attain its infimum, and the infimum could be zero even if f > 0 everywhere.\n\nWait, but if f is Riemann integrable, it's bounded. So let's say m is the infimum of f over [a, b]. If m > 0, then the integral would be at least m*(b - a) > 0. So, if m = 0, then the infimum is zero. So, the infimum over the entire interval is zero. Then, there exists a sequence of points x_n in [a, b] such that f(x_n) → 0. By Bolzano-Weierstrass, this sequence has a convergent subsequence x_{n_k} → c ∈ [a, b]. Now, since f is positive everywhere, f(c) > 0. If f is continuous at c, then there exists a neighborhood around c where f(x) ≥ f(c)/2 > 0, contradicting that f(x_n) approaches zero. Therefore, f must be discontinuous at c. But this only shows that c is a point of discontinuity. However, since f is Riemann integrable, its set of discontinuities has measure zero. Again, measure theory creeps in.\n\nAlternatively, since the integral is zero and f ≥ 0, then for every subinterval [c, d], ∫_c^d f = 0. Therefore, applying the same logic, the infimum of f on any subinterval is zero. But this leads to the same problem as before.\n\nWait, going back to the Baire category approach: If each F_n is closed and nowhere dense, then their union is meager, but [a, b] is a complete metric space, hence non-meager. Therefore, some F_n must be somewhere dense, i.e., contains an interval. Therefore, there exists an interval [c, d] where f ≥ 1/n, hence the integral over [c, d] is ≥ (d - c)/n > 0, contradiction. This seems like a valid approach without measure theory, using Baire category. But is there a way to avoid Baire?\n\nMaybe use compactness. For each x in [a, b], since f(x) > 0, there exists an open interval around x where f(y) > f(x)/2 for all y in the interval. If f is continuous at x, this is possible. But if f is discontinuous at x, this may not hold. However, the collection of these intervals covers [a, b]. By compactness, there exists a finite subcover. Therefore, [a, b] is covered by finitely many intervals where f > some positive numbers. Hence, the minimum of these positive numbers is a lower bound for f on the entire interval. But this is only true if f is continuous at those points. Since we might have covered the interval with neighborhoods where f is bounded below, but if those neighborhoods come from points where f is discontinuous, then this doesn't necessarily hold. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to use the definition of Riemann integral. Suppose ∫_a^b f = 0. Then for any ε > 0, there exists a partition P such that U(P, f) < ε. Let's choose ε = m*(b - a)/2, where m is the infimum of f over [a, b]. But wait, m could be zero. If m > 0, then U(P, f) ≥ m*(b - a), which would contradict ε = m*(b - a)/2. But m = 0, so this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, choose a specific ε. Suppose ∫_a^b f = 0. Then for ε = 1, there exists a partition P such that U(P, f) < 1. For this partition, the sum of sup f * delta x_i < 1. Similarly, since f > 0, each sup f ≥ 0. But how does this help?\n\nWait, if in every subinterval of P, the supremum of f is less than 1/(b - a), then the upper sum would be less than 1. But even if that's the case, f could still be positive everywhere. For example, f(x) = 1/(b - a) for all x, then the integral would be 1. So, this approach doesn't lead to a contradiction.\n\nAnother idea: Since f is Riemann integrable and positive everywhere, there must be some subinterval where the oscillation of f is less than its infimum on that subinterval. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps use the fact that if the integral is zero, then for every x in [a, b], the integral from a to x of f(t) dt = 0. Then, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, if F(x) = ∫_a^x f(t) dt, then F'(x) = f(x) almost everywhere. But F(x) is identically zero, so F'(x) = 0 almost everywhere, contradicting f(x) > 0. But this uses measure theory (almost everywhere) and the FTC, which might require f to be continuous, which we don't have.\n\nI think the most viable approach without measure theory is the Baire category theorem argument. Since [a, b] is a complete metric space, and the union of the closed sets F_n = {x | f(x) ≥ 1/n} covers [a, b], by the Baire Category Theorem, at least one F_n has non-empty interior. Hence, there's an interval [c, d] where f ≥ 1/n, so the integral over [c, d] is at least (d - c)/n > 0, and the rest of the integral is non-negative, so the total integral is positive. Therefore, the assumption that the integral is zero leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is not familiar with Baire's theorem, there's another way. Suppose that for every interval [c, d] ⊆ [a, b], inf_{[c,d]} f = 0. Then, we can construct a sequence of nested intervals where the infimum of f approaches zero. By the Nested Interval Theorem, there's a point x common to all these intervals. At that point, since f(x) > 0, there exists ε > 0 such that f(x) ≥ ε. But by construction, every neighborhood around x contains intervals where inf f < ε/2, which would imply that there are points arbitrarily close to x where f < ε/2. This contradicts the definition of infimum only if x is a limit of points where f approaches zero. However, f(x) is positive, so this would mean x is a point of discontinuity. But how does that help?\n\nOverall, the Baire category approach seems the most straightforward, even if it's a bit advanced. Therefore, the answer should outline that approach.",
