    "Content": "Let $k$ be a field and $K=k(x_0,x_1,\\ldots, x_n)[x]$.  Define $$\\mathcal{L}_k(x)\\triangleq \\prod_{\\substack{j=0\\\\  j\\ne k}}^n\\frac{x-x_j}{x_k-x_j}.$$ Is there a purely combinatorial way to show that\n  $$\\sum_{k=0}^n\\mathcal{L}_k(x)=1?$$ That is, I would like to consider the $\\mathcal{L}_k(x)$ as formal polynomials, not as functions. I am aware of proof by interpolation, but I think there must be an interesting combinatorial proof using counting arguments with the indices. My attempt. To directly add the summands together, we need a common denominator.  Let $R_n=\\{0,\\ldots, n\\}$, $S=\\{(i,j)\\in R_n\\times R_n |j<i\\}$, and $S_k=\\{(i,j)\\in S | i=k\\text{ or }j=k\\}$.\nFirst, note that\n$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\\prod_{\\substack{j=0\\\\  j\\ne k}}^n\\frac{1}{x_k-x_j}&=&\n\\prod_{\\substack{j=0\\\\  j< k}}^n\\frac{1}{x_k-x_j}\\prod_{\\substack{j=0\\\\  j> k}}^n\\frac{1}{-(x_j-x_k)}\\\\&=&\\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}\\frac{1}{x_k-x_j}\\prod_{j=k+1}^n\\frac{1}{-(x_j-x_k)}\\\\\n&=&(-1)^{n-k}\\prod_{(i,j)\\in S_k}\\frac{1}{x_i-x_j}\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$\nTo get a common denominator, we therfore multiply each term by $$\\frac{\\prod_{(i,j)\\in S\\setminus S_k}x_i-x_j}{\\prod_{(i,j)\\in S\\setminus S_k}x_i-x_j}$$ to obtain $$\\prod_{j<i}\\frac{1}{x_i-x_j}\\sum_{k=0}^n\\left((-1)^{n-k}\\prod_{\\substack{j=0\\\\ j\\ne k}}^n(x-x_j)\\prod_{(i,j)\\in S\\setminus S_k}(x_i-x_j)\\right)$$\n...and here is where I can't get stuck, can't think of a how to continue.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a nice argument using the Vandermonde determinant. I don't know if it's combinatorial enough to your taste. Consider the Vandermonde matrix $V(x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. Its determinant is $$D = \\prod_{0 \\leq i< j \\leq n} (x_i-x_j).$$ (There are many arguments for this.) Remark that if we shift all of the $x_i$'s by the same variable, the determinant doesn't change, because $x_i-x_j = (x_i+x)-(x_j+x)$. Therefore, $$D(x_0+x,\\: x_1+x,\\: \\dots,\\: x_n+x) = D(x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n) = D.$$ But now if we expand the determinant $D(x_0+x,\\: x_1+x,\\: \\dots,\\: x_n+x)$ along the column of $1$'s, we get precisely the formula $\\sum \\mathcal L_k(x) = 1$ after dividing by $D$ (using induction on each of the $n+1$ smaller determinants). Edit: Here's an example of what I mean, for $n=2$. I hope it's clear. At the top we have the Vandermonde determinant, and I have expanded it out along the column of $1$'s. I end up with $3$ Vandermonde determinants of one smaller size, which I also evaluate using the trick above. Dividing the bottom result by the top result gives your formula. Sorry about the picture quality, it's a narrow space and I couldn't get the whole board in any other way.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that a sum of Lagrange polynomials equals 1 using a combinatorial proof. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions that K is the field k(x0, x1, ..., xn)[x], and defines the Lagrange polynomial L_k(x). The key assumptions here are about the structure of the polynomials and the field. The user wants a combinatorial proof, not interpolation, treating them as formal polynomials.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem, the assumptions would include the definition of L_k(x), the field K, and the requirement for a combinatorial proof. Wait, the problem states \"purely combinatorial way\" and \"formal polynomials\", so those are important conditions.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the proof should not use interpolation but rather counting arguments. That's another assumption on the method. So each of these points should be separate assumptions.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption: K is defined as k(x0, x1, ..., xn)[x],\nAssumption: L_k(x) is defined as the product over j≠k of (x - x_j)/(x_k - x_j),\nAssumption: The proof must be purely combinatorial,\nAssumption: The proof must treat L_k(x) as formal polynomials, not functions.\n\nThen the problem statement is to show that the sum of L_k(x) from k=0 to n equals 1.\n\nI need to check if all these are single conditions per line. Yes, each line addresses a separate aspect. The definition of K, the definition of L_k(x), the requirement on the proof method, and the treatment of the polynomials as formal. That should cover the assumptions. The user's attempt also mentions using common denominators and manipulating products, but those are part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions. The problem's assumptions are given in the problem statement, not the user's attempt.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list those four assumptions. Let me verify again:\n\n- The field K is given as k(x0,...,xn)[x], that's one assumption.\n- The definition of L_k(x) is another.\n- The requirement of a combinatorial proof is a third.\n- Treating them as formal polynomials is the fourth.\n\nYes, that seems right. Then the problem is to show the sum equals 1. Alright, that should be it.",
