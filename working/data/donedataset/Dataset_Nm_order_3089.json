    "Content": "In Milnor's book Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint there's the following problem: Problem $6$ (Brouwer). Show that any map $S^n\\to S^n$ with degree different from $(-1)^{n+1}$ must have a fixed point. My solution: Assume that the map $f:S^n\\to S^n$ has no fixed points. Let $a:S^n\\to S^n$ denote the antipodal map $a(x)=-x$. Then the map $a\\circ f$ is homotopic to the identity as follows: Since $x$ is never mapped to $-x$ (by assumption), there exist a unique shortest great circle arc from $a(f(x))$ to $x$, simply take the straight line homotopy flowing along such arches to get a homotopy $a\\circ f\\simeq\\operatorname{id}$. Now we have:\n$$1=\\deg(\\operatorname{id})=\\deg(a\\circ f)=\\deg(a)\\deg(f)=(-1)^{n+1}\\deg(f)$$\nand thus $\\deg(f)=(-1)^{n+1}$. My questions: Is this solution correct? How to show that the homotopy is continuous? It seems intuitively true to me, but I'm not sure about how to proceed to show it. Maybe saying that it is the flow of some good tangent field? Are there other (elegant/short/interesting) proofs for this fact?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think, what you gave is (a sketch of) the simplest proof, unless you know about the Lefshetz fixed point theorem . Using the latter, then the argument goes like this: $H_k(S^n)$ is nonzero only in dimensions $0$ and $n$ and $H_0(S^n)\\cong H_n(S^n)\\cong Z$. The action of $f$ on $H_0$ is trivial and the action on $H_n$ is by multiplication by $d=\\deg(f)$. \nThe Lefschetz number of $f$ then equals\n$$\n\\Lambda_f= (-1)^0 + (-1)^n (d)= 1+ d(-1)^n. \n$$ \nThis number is nonzero unless \n$$\nd= (-1)^{n+1}\n$$\nas required. If $\\Lambda_f\\ne 0$ then $f$ has a fixed point (this is the Lefschetz fixed point theorem). As for your solution, do not bother with geodesic flow, that's unnecessarily complicated; you can use linear algebra instead. For $t\\in [0,1]$ and $x, y\\in S^n$ non-antipodal, define\n$$\nz_t= \\frac{tx+(1-t)y}{|tx+(1-t)y|}\\in S^n. \n$$ \nThis is a point on the shortest arc of the great circle connecting $x$ and $y$. \nThe rest you can figure out yourself.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the specified format, which includes listing assumptions and then the problem statement. Let me start by understanding the original question from Math Stack Exchange.\n\nThe original question is about the fixed point theorem on spheres. The user is referring to Milnor's book where the problem is to show that any map f: Sⁿ → Sⁿ with degree different from (-1)ⁿ⁺¹ must have a fixed point. The user provided their solution, which involves assuming no fixed points, using the antipodal map, constructing a homotopy, and then concluding the degree must be (-1)ⁿ⁺¹. They then ask if their solution is correct, how to show the homotopy is continuous, and if there are other elegant proofs.\n\nBut according to the task, I need to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem. The example given shows that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem, the key assumptions would relate to the map f. The problem states that the degree of f is different from (-1)ⁿ⁺¹, so that's one assumption. Then, the conclusion is that f must have a fixed point. However, in the user's solution, they assume that f has no fixed points and arrive at the degree being (-1)ⁿ⁺¹. So the problem's original statement is the contrapositive: if degree ≠ (-1)ⁿ⁺¹, then there's a fixed point.\n\nSo to structure the problem, the assumptions should include that we have a map f from Sⁿ to Sⁿ, and that the degree of f is not equal to (-1)ⁿ⁺¹. Then the problem is to prove that f has a fixed point.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement as given in the original question, it's stated as \"Show that any map Sⁿ→Sⁿ with degree different from (-1)ⁿ⁺¹ must have a fixed point.\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f: Sⁿ → Sⁿ is a continuous map (since we're talking about degree in algebraic topology, maps are usually continuous).\n2. The degree of f, deg(f), is different from (-1)ⁿ⁺¹.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that f has a fixed point.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the problem here, the assumptions are about the map f and its degree. So each assumption should be on one line, each addressing one property.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list:\n\n- f is a continuous map from Sⁿ to Sⁿ.\n- The degree of f is different from (-1)^{n+1}.\n\nThen the Problem is to prove that f has a fixed point.\n\nNow, checking the user's solution, they mention assuming no fixed points and deriving the degree as (-1)^{n+1}, which is the contrapositive. But the problem statement is the original implication. However, in structuring the problem, we need to present the original problem's conditions, not the user's solution approach. The user's questions are about their solution's correctness and the homotopy's continuity, but the task is to structure the problem as per the given format, not to answer the user's questions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the map f and its degree, leading to the problem of proving the existence of a fixed point.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the user's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example seems different. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was wrong, but according to the user's instruction, the example is how they want the formatting done. Wait, in the original problem, the user's formatted problem lists two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is an integer is correct, but the second assumption that n is divisible by 7 is not present in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a typo or the user made an error in their example. Alternatively, maybe the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7? But the original problem says \"for every integer n\". Hmm, maybe there's a confusion here. But regardless, I need to follow the user's example structure, which in that case, extracted assumptions from the problem. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the user didn't state all assumptions, so they had to be extracted. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. Then why is there an assumption that n is divisible by 7? That seems incorrect. Unless there's a mistake in the example. But I have to proceed with the current task.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states: \"Show that any map Sⁿ→Sⁿ with degree different from (-1)^{n+1} must have a fixed point.\" Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f: Sⁿ → Sⁿ is a continuous map.\n2. deg(f) ≠ (-1)^{n+1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that f has a fixed point.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem, the Assumption section lists these two points, each as separate lines.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a single property. The first assumption is about the map f being a continuous map from Sⁿ to Sⁿ. The second is about its degree. So that should be correct.\n\nThe user's solution mentions assuming no fixed points and constructing a homotopy, but that's part of their approach, not the problem's assumptions. The original problem's assumptions are just about the map and its degree.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a continuous map from Sⁿ to Sⁿ,\nThe degree of f is different from (-1)^{n+1}.\nProblem:\nProve that f has a fixed point.\n\nYes, that seems accurate. The user's question included their solution attempt, but the task is to structure the problem as per the given format, not to include the user's solution or questions. So the formatted problem will list the assumptions as above and state the problem as proving the existence of a fixed point.",
