    "AcceptedAnswer": "Everything will follow from the iteration of the following lemma (whose proof is explained\nat the very end of this answer) : FUNDAMENTAL LEMMA. Let ${\\mathbb K}$ be a field, and let\n$a$ be a non-cube in ${\\mathbb K}$. Then all the “new” cubes  in ${\\mathbb K}(\\sqrt[3]a)$ \nare made up of $a$ and “old” cubes : they can be written as $w^3,aw^3$ or $a^2(w^3)$ for some $w\\in {\\mathbb K}$. COROLLARY 1. Let ${\\mathbb K}$ be a subfield of $\\mathbb R$, and let $a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ be a sequence of real numbers such that for any $i$, $a_i$ is a non-cube\nin ${\\mathbb K}(\\sqrt[3]{a_1},\\sqrt[3]{a_2}, \\ldots ,\\sqrt[3]{a_{i-1}})$. Then all the cubes in ${\\mathbb K}(\\sqrt[3]{a_1},\\sqrt[3]{a_2}, \\ldots ,\\sqrt[3]{a_{n}})$ can be written as $a_1^{i_1}a_2^{i_2} \\ldots a_n^{i_n}(w^3)$ where $w\\in {\\mathbb K}$ and each\n$i_k$ is $0,1$ or $2$. COROLLARY 2. Let $r_1,r_2, \\ldots ,r_n$ be positive rational numbers such that there is no-nontrivial relationship between them of the form\n $r_1^{i_1}r_2^{i_2} \\ldots r_n^{i_n}=w^3$, where each\n$i_k$ is $0,1$ or $2$, and $w$ is rational (non-trivial means that not all the $i_k$ are zero). Then the $3^n$ algebraic numbers $s_1^{i_1}s_2^{i_2} \\ldots s_n^{i_n}$ (where\n$s_i=\\sqrt[3]{r_i}$) are linearly independent over the rationals. Now, suppose that $\\sqrt[3]{a}+\\sqrt[3]{b}+\\sqrt[3]{c}=\\sqrt[3]{1}+\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{4}$. The degree \nof the extension ${\\mathbb Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2},\\sqrt[3]{4},\\sqrt[3]{a},\\sqrt[3]{b},\\sqrt[3]{c})$\n(call it $d$) is a power of three. If it were strictly greater than $3$, then $d\\geq 9$\nand by corollary 2, any non-trivial relation between cube roots would need at least nine\nterms, which is too much for the six we've got. So $d=3$, which means that $a,b,c$ must all be, up to sign,  (possibly negative) powers of $2$.  So there are essentially three cases : $$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sqrt[3]{2^i}+\\sqrt[3]{2^j}+\\sqrt[3]{2^k}&=& \\sqrt[3]{1}+\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{4} \\\\\n\\sqrt[3]{2^i}+\\sqrt[3]{2^j}-\\sqrt[3]{2^k}&=& \\sqrt[3]{1}+\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{4} \\\\\n\\sqrt[3]{2^i}-\\sqrt[3]{2^j}-\\sqrt[3]{2^k}&=& \\sqrt[3]{1}+\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{4} \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\n$$\nwhere $i,j,k$ are integers. It is easy now to see then that $i,j,k$ must form a complete\nsystem of residues modulo $3$, and to check that $(1,2,4)$ is indeed the only solution\nto the original problem. PROOF OF FUNDAMENTAL LEMMA . Let ${\\mathbb L}={\\mathbb K}(\\sqrt[3]a)$. We have \n$[{\\mathbb L}:{\\mathbb K}]=3$. Let $c$ be a cube in $\\mathbb L$. Then, there are\n$x_1,x_2,x_3 \\in K$ such that $c=(x_1+x_2\\sqrt[3]{a}+x_3\\sqrt[3]{a^2})^3$. Expanding, we find $c=C_0+3C_1\\sqrt[3]a+3C_2\\sqrt[3]{a^2}$, with $$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nC_0&=&\\bigg(x_1^3 + 6ax_1x_2x_3 + (ax_2^3 + a^2x_3^3)\\bigg), \\\\\nC_1&=&\\bigg(x_1^2x_2 + ax_1x_3^2 + ax_2^2x_3\\bigg), \\\\\nC_2&=&\\bigg(x_1^2x_3 + x_1x_2^2 + ax_2x_3^2\\bigg) \n\\end{eqnarray}\n$$ So $C_1$ and $C_2$ must both be $0$, and hence $$\nax_2x_3(x_2^3-ax_3^3)=(x_2^2+x_1x_3)C_1-(ax_3^2+x_1x_2)C_2=0\n$$ Since $a$ is not a cube in $\\mathbb K$, we must have $x_3=0$ or $x_2=0$.\nIf $x_3=0$, $C_2$ simplifies to $x_1x_2^2$, and if $x_2=0$, $C_2$ simplifies\nto $x_1^2x_3$. So at least two of $x_1,x_2,x_3$ are zero, which means that $x_1+x_2\\sqrt[3]{a}+x_3\\sqrt[3]{a^2}$ is a multiple (by some element of $\\mathbb K$) \nof $1,\\sqrt[3]{a}$, or $\\sqrt[3]{a^2}$, as wished.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original question is about whether there exist rational numbers a, b, c such that the sum of the cube roots of 1, 2, and 4 equals the sum of the cube roots of a, b, and c, with some conditions on a, b, c.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a, b, c are rational numbers. Also, they must satisfy a ≤ b ≤ c, and the triple (a, b, c) is not equal to (1, 2, 4). The goal is to prove whether such a triple exists or not.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions line by line: each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. a, b, c are rational numbers. That's one assumption.\n2. The ordering a ≤ b ≤ c. Each of a, b, c is involved here, but the condition is about their order, so maybe that's a single condition on the triple.\n3. The triple (a, b, c) is not equal to (1, 2, 4). That's another condition.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"such that a ≤ b ≤ c\" and \"(a, b, c) ≠ (1, 2, 4)\". Each of these applies to the triple as a whole. However, the format requires each assumption to apply to one object. Hmm, maybe we need to split them into separate lines. For example:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are rational numbers,\na ≤ b ≤ c,\n(a, b, c) ≠ (1, 2, 4).\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The first is about their rationality, the second about ordering, and the third about excluding the original triple.\n\nThen the problem is to prove whether such a, b, c exist or not. So the problem statement would be the original question, rephrased as a directive.\n\nWait, the original question is phrased as \"How to prove that there are no triples...\" or \"Or maybe there exists one?\" So it's asking to either prove non-existence or find an example. Therefore, the problem should be framed as determining existence under those conditions.\n\nBut according to the example given, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that...\". But here, it's a bit different. The user's example had a problem to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is to prove that no such triples exist (or to find one if it does). So the problem statement should be: \"Prove that there are no triples (a, b, c) of rational numbers with a ≤ b ≤ c, different from (1, 2, 4), such that √³1 + √³2 + √³4 = √³a + √³b + √³c. Or determine if such a triple exists.\"\n\nBut the original question is phrased as: \"How to prove that there are no triples... Or maybe there exists one?\" So the problem is to either prove non-existence or find an example. Therefore, in the problem statement, it should be presented as such.\n\nBut following the example format, maybe it's better to present the problem as \"Prove that there are no triples...\" since the example uses \"Prove that...\". However, the original question is more of a \"Does there exist...\" So perhaps the problem statement should be \"Determine whether there exist rational numbers a, b, c such that...\", but the example uses \"Prove that...\". Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem kept \"Prove that...\". So maybe the structure here should follow the original question's intent. The user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which includes the \"Problem\" part. So the problem part should be the question as posed, but possibly rephrased as a directive.\n\nIn the original question, it's asking \"How to prove that there are no triples...\" or \"Or maybe there exists one?\" So the problem is to either prove non-existence or find an example. However, in the formatted problem, maybe we can phrase it as: \"Prove that there are no triples (a, b, c) with a, b, c ∈ ℚ, a ≤ b ≤ c, and (a, b, c) ≠ (1, 2, 4), such that √³1 + √³2 + √³4 = √³a + √³b + √³c. Or determine if such a triple exists.\"\n\nBut perhaps to fit the example's style, which is a statement to prove, even if the original question is phrased as a question. Alternatively, since the example took the original problem's statement and rephrased the assumptions, maybe here we should present the problem as \"Prove that there are no triples...\" since that's the original ask, with an alternative possibility.\n\nBut the user's example had an original problem that was a statement to prove, and the formatted problem also was a statement to prove. Here, the original problem is a question about existence. So maybe the problem should be phrased as \"Determine whether there exist rational numbers a, b, c...\" but the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's example included assumptions that were in the original problem, even if they were not explicitly stated as assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number  \nA(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n )  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems wrong. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which means n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. So perhaps the example is incorrect, or maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption? No, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error.\n\nBut given that example, the user's instruction is to follow that format. So in the example, they extracted assumptions from the problem, even if they weren't explicitly stated. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example had a typo, and actually required n divisible by 7? Otherwise, the formatted problem in the example is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the example is a bad one. However, since the user provided it, we have to follow their structure, even if it's flawed. So in that example, they took \"for every integer n\" as an assumption that n is an integer, and added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's not in the original problem. So maybe the user intended that in the formatted problem, the assumptions are all the conditions given in the problem, split into separate lines.\n\nBut in the original example problem, the user structured it with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So this suggests that the example might have a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to extract all the conditions in the problem, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nBut in the current problem, the Math Stack Exchange question is asking whether there exist rational a,b,c with certain conditions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a, b, c are rational numbers (∈ ℚ)\n- a ≤ b ≤ c\n- (a, b, c) ≠ (1, 2, 4)\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that no such triples exist, or to find one if it does.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those three assumptions and then state the problem as per the original question.\n\nSo following the example's structure, even if the example had a mistake, the user wants to list each assumption on a separate line, each applying to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are rational numbers,\na ≤ b ≤ c,\n(a, b, c) ≠ (1, 2, 4).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are no triples (a, b, c) satisfying the assumptions such that √³1 + √³2 + √³4 = √³a + √³b + √³c, or determine if such a triple exists.\n\nBut in the example, the problem statement is phrased as \"Prove that...\", so perhaps here it should be similar. Alternatively, since the original question is a yes/no question, perhaps the problem is to determine existence.\n\nBut the example's problem was \"Prove that...\", so maybe the user wants to follow that. However, the original problem here is phrased as a question. So perhaps the problem should be: \"Prove that there are no triples (a, b, c) of rational numbers with a ≤ b ≤ c, different from (1, 2, 4), such that √³1 + √³2 + √³4 = √³a + √³b + √³c, or show that such a triple exists.\"\n\nBut the original question is asking to prove that no such triples exist or maybe find one. So the problem statement is to do that.\n\nBut in terms of the format, the problem line should capture the core question. Given the example, perhaps it's better to present it as \"Prove that there are no triples...\" with the given assumptions, but the original problem also allows for the possibility of existence. However, since the answer might be that no such triples exist, the problem is to prove that or find a counterexample.\n\nBut in academic problems, often such questions are posed as \"Prove or disprove\", but here the user's example used \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the safest way is to follow the original question's phrasing, which is \"How to prove that there are no triples... Or maybe there exists one?\" So the problem is to either prove non-existence or demonstrate existence.\n\nTherefore, the problem line would be: \"Prove that there are no triples (a, b, c) with the given assumptions such that √³1 + √³2 + √³4 = √³a + √³b + √³c, or determine if such a triple exists.\"\n\nAlternatively, to make it a directive: \"Determine whether there exist rational numbers a, b, c satisfying the assumptions such that...\".\n\nBut given the example's structure, which transformed the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement, perhaps here we should do the same. The original question is asking to prove that no such triples exist, or find one. So the problem statement is to do exactly that.\n\nBut the example included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. In this case, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem: a, b, c are rational, ordered, and not the original triple. So the formatted problem should list those assumptions and then state the problem as proving non-existence or finding existence.\n\nHowever, given the example, which took the original problem's conclusion and made it the problem statement with added assumptions, here we need to present the problem as the core question with the assumptions listed separately.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are rational numbers,\na ≤ b ≤ c,\n(a, b, c) ≠ (1, 2, 4).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are no triples (a, b, c) such that √³1 + √³2 + √³4 = √³a + √³b + √³c, or determine if such a triple exists.\n\nThis captures the original question's intent while separating the conditions into assumptions.\n\nI think this is correct. Each assumption is listed separately, and the problem is to prove non-existence or find existence under those assumptions.",
