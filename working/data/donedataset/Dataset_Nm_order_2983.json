    "Content": "I'm working through Foundations of Mathematical Analysis by Johnsonbaugh.\nThe following problem is given before MVT is proven. However, we do know about compactness, completeness, continuity, intermediate value theorem, metric spaces, sequences, etc. I am trying to find a proof that does not use MVT. This question seems similar to mine, but they end up using something equivalent to Rolle's theorem in the answer. Problem: Suppose $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in (a,b)$. Prove that $f$ is constant on $(a,b)$. Attempt: Let $x,y \\in (a,b)$. We have $$f'(x) = \\lim_{z \\to x} \\frac{f(z)-f(x)}{z-x} = 0$$ and $$f'(y) = \\lim_{z \\to y} \\frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y} = 0$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a < x < y < b$. We will prove $f(y)=f(x)$ by proving $|f(y)-f(x)| < \\epsilon(y-x)$ for every $\\epsilon>0$. So fix $\\epsilon > 0$. By the hypothesis on vanishing of derivatives, for every $t \\in [x,y]$ there is $\\delta_t > 0$ such that for $|z-t|<\\delta_t$, $|f(z)-f(t)|<\\epsilon|z-t|$. Now here is a minor little trick: The intervals $(t-\\delta_t/2,t+\\delta_t/2)$ (of radius $\\delta_t/2$, rather than $\\delta_t$) cover $[x,y]$. For now say an interval of the form $(t-\\delta_t/2,t+\\delta_t/2)$ is a narrow interval and one of the form $(t-\\delta_t,t+\\delta_t)$ is a wide interval. By compactness there is a finite subcover by narrow intervals, centered at say $t_1,\\dotsc,t_s$, with $x \\leq t_1 < t_2 < \\dotsc < t_s \\leq y$. We can reduce to an irredundant cover, i.e., so that no narrow interval centered at $t_i$ is contained in the narrow interval centered at $t_j$ for $j \\neq i$. This implies that for each $i$, the narrow intervals centered at $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$ overlap: otherwise, at least one point in the gap between them must be covered by the interval centered at some $t_j$ with $j<i$ or $j>i+1$; and either $t_i$ is redundant, or $t_{i+1}$ is redundant. Next, this implies that for each $i$, $|t_{i+1}-t_i| < \\max(\\delta_{t_{i+1}},\\delta_{t_i})$. Indeed, if a point $u$, $t_i < u < t_{i+1}$, lies in the intersection of the narrow intervals, then\n$$\n  t_{i+1}-t_i = t_{i+1}-u+u-t_i < \\delta_{t_{i+1}}/2 + \\delta_{t_i}/2 \\leq 2 \\max(\\delta_{t_{i+1}}/2,\\delta_{t_i}/2).\n$$\nIt follows that for each $i$, $t_{i+1}$ lies in the wide interval centered at $t_i$ or $t_i$ lies in the wide interval centered at $t_{i+1}$ (or both). In particular, for each $i$, $|f(t_{i+1})-f(t_i)| < \\epsilon |t_{i+1}-t_i|$. We claim that the same relation holds between $x$ and $t_1$, and between $y$ and $t_s$. Indeed, $x$ lies in the narrow interval centered at $t_1$, hence also in the wide interval. So $|f(t_1)-f(x)| < \\epsilon |t_1-x|$. Similarly for $y$ and $t_s$. Putting it all together, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n  |f(y)-f(x)| &\\leq |f(y)-f(t_s)| + |f(t_s)-f(t_{s-1})| + \\dotsb + |f(t_1)-f(x)| \\\\\n  &< \\epsilon|y-t_s| + \\epsilon|t_s-t_{s-1}| + \\dotsb + \\epsilon|t_1-x| \\\\\n  &= \\epsilon(y-t_s) + \\epsilon(t_s-t_{s-1}) + \\dotsb + \\epsilon(t_1-x) \\\\\n  &= \\epsilon(y-x),\n\\end{split}\n$$\nas claimed. Notes: (1) Thanks for several very helpful comments about simplifications, gaps in the proof, etc! (2) I wonder if an application of Cousin's theorem might simplify the argument.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The task is to prove that if a function f has a derivative equal to zero for all x in the interval (a, b), then f is constant on that interval. But we can't use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT), Rolle's Theorem, or anything equivalent. The user mentions knowing about compactness, completeness, continuity, IVT, metric spaces, sequences, etc., so maybe we can use those concepts instead.\n\nFirst, I recall that the standard proof uses MVT: if the derivative is zero everywhere, then between any two points x and y, there's some c where the derivative is (f(y)-f(x))/(y-x), which would be zero, hence f(y) = f(x). But since we can't use MVT, we need another approach.\n\nLet me think about the definition of the derivative. If f'(x) = 0 everywhere, that means the limit of [f(z) - f(x)]/(z - x) as z approaches x is zero. So for any epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that if 0 < |z - x| < delta, then |f(z) - f(x)| / |z - x| < epsilon. Which implies |f(z) - f(x)| < epsilon |z - x|. This gives a local Lipschitz condition with constant epsilon. Maybe we can use this to show that f is locally constant, and then use connectedness of the interval to conclude it's constant everywhere.\n\nWait, how does that work? If f is locally constant on an interval, which is connected, then f must be constant globally. Because in a connected space, the only clopen subsets are the empty set and the space itself. So if every point has a neighborhood where f is constant, then f is constant everywhere. That might be a way to go.\n\nBut how to show that f is locally constant using the derivative zero condition? Let's take any point x in (a, b). Since f'(x) = 0, for any epsilon > 0, there's a delta such that |f(z) - f(x)| < epsilon |z - x| when z is within delta of x. If we choose epsilon = 1, then there's a delta_1 where |f(z) - f(x)| < |z - x| for z in (x - delta_1, x + delta_1). Now, maybe use this to show that f is constant in that neighborhood.\n\nWait, but how? Because even if the difference quotient is less than 1, it doesn't immediately tell us that f(z) = f(x). Maybe we need to iterate this. Suppose we take two points in the neighborhood, say z1 and z2. Then |f(z1) - f(z2)| <= |f(z1) - f(x)| + |f(z2) - f(x)| < |z1 - x| + |z2 - x|. But unless z1 and z2 are the same as x, this doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the derivative is zero to construct a sequence of points approaching x where the function values are equal? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: use the concept of path-connectedness. For any two points x and y in (a, b), we can connect them with a line segment. But how does that help without MVT?\n\nWait, perhaps use the completeness of real numbers. Let me pick two points x < y in (a, b). I want to show f(x) = f(y). Let's define the set S = { z in [x, y] | f(z) = f(x) }. If I can show S is both open and closed in [x, y], then since [x, y] is connected, S must be the entire interval, hence f(y) = f(x).\n\nTo show S is open: Take any z in S. Since f'(z) = 0, there exists a delta such that for all w in (z - delta, z + delta), |f(w) - f(z)| < |w - z|. But if we choose delta small enough so that the interval is within [x, y]. Then, if we can show f(w) = f(z) for all w in that interval, then S is open.\n\nWait, but how does |f(w) - f(z)| < |w - z| lead to f(w) = f(z)? It only gives a bound. Unless we use a more clever argument.\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that the derivative is zero everywhere, so for any point in S, there is a neighborhood where the function doesn't change much. But how to turn that into being exactly constant.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we take two points x and y, and consider the supremum of all t in [x, y] such that f(t) = f(x). Let c be the supremum. If c = y, we are done. Otherwise, since f is continuous (because differentiable), we have f(c) = f(x). Then, since f'(c) = 0, there's a neighborhood around c where |f(w) - f(c)| < |w - c|. But this should allow points w > c where f(w) = f(c) = f(x), contradicting that c is the supremum. Therefore, c must be y. Hence, f(y) = f(x). Hmm, that might work.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let x < y in (a, b). Let c = sup { t ∈ [x, y] | f(t) = f(x) }. Since f is continuous (as it's differentiable), the set { t ∈ [x, y] | f(t) = f(x) } is closed, so c belongs to it. If c < y, then since f'(c) = 0, for any epsilon > 0, there exists delta > 0 such that for |w - c| < delta, |f(w) - f(c)| <= epsilon |w - c|. Take epsilon = 1. Then, for w in (c - delta, c + delta), |f(w) - f(c)| <= |w - c|. Now, consider w = c + delta/2. Then, |f(w) - f(c)| <= delta/2. But f(c) = f(x). Wait, how does this help? Maybe we can iterate this?\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that the derivative is zero, maybe integrate? But the problem states not to use MVT or Rolle's, but maybe integration isn't allowed either? Wait, the user didn't mention integration. But if we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but that usually requires the MVT for proofs. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: if the derivative is zero everywhere, then the function has the Lipschitz constant zero, hence is constant. But that might be circular. Because to show that a function with derivative zero is Lipschitz with constant zero, you might need MVT.\n\nAlternatively, use the definition of the derivative and overlapping intervals. For any two points x and y, take a sequence of points between x and y such that each consecutive pair is within the delta neighborhood where the function difference is bounded by epsilon times the distance. Then sum up the differences.\n\nLet me try that. Let x and y be two points in (a, b), x < y. Let's pick a partition x = x0 < x1 < ... < xn = y such that each |xi+1 - xi| < delta, where delta corresponds to epsilon = 1. Then, for each i, |f(xi+1) - f(xi)| <= |xi+1 - xi| * 1. So the total difference |f(y) - f(x)| <= sum |xi+1 - xi| = y - x. But this gives |f(y) - f(x)| <= y - x. But if we make the partition finer, maybe take delta approaching zero, but that would make the sum still y - x. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but if we can choose epsilon to be arbitrary small, perhaps? Because for any epsilon, we can find a delta such that |f(z) - f(x)| <= epsilon |z - x|. Then, if we make epsilon very small, the total sum could be made arbitrarily small. Let's see.\n\nSuppose for any epsilon > 0, we can choose a partition where each |xi+1 - xi| < delta (depending on epsilon), such that |f(xi+1) - f(xi)| <= epsilon |xi+1 - xi|. Then, summing over all i, |f(y) - f(x)| <= epsilon (y - x). Since epsilon is arbitrary, this would imply |f(y) - f(x)| = 0, so f(y) = f(x). That seems like a valid approach.\n\nBut to formalize this, we need to construct such a partition. Since the derivative is zero everywhere, for each point z in [x, y], there exists a delta_z > 0 such that for all w in (z - delta_z, z + delta_z), |f(w) - f(z)| <= epsilon |w - z|. Then, the collection of intervals (z - delta_z, z + delta_z) forms an open cover of [x, y]. By compactness, there exists a finite subcover. Then, we can use the Lebesgue number lemma to get a partition where each subinterval is contained in one of the open sets from the subcover. Then, on each subinterval, the function's difference is bounded by epsilon times the length. Summing up gives |f(y) - f(x)| <= epsilon (y - x), and since epsilon is arbitrary, f(y) = f(x).\n\nYes, that seems like a valid proof without using MVT. It uses compactness and the definition of the derivative, along with the fact that the interval is connected. The key steps are:\n\n1. For any two points x and y, consider the interval [x, y].\n2. Use the derivative condition to create an open cover of [x, y] where each point has a neighborhood where the function's difference is bounded by epsilon times the distance.\n3. By compactness, extract a finite subcover and create a partition of [x, y] such that each subinterval is within one of these neighborhoods.\n4. Sum the differences over the partition to get |f(y) - f(x)| <= epsilon (y - x).\n5. Since epsilon is arbitrary, conclude f(y) = f(x).\n\nThis approach uses compactness (Heine-Borel theorem), continuity (since differentiable functions are continuous), and the definition of the derivative, but avoids MVT or Rolle's theorem. The connectedness of the interval ensures that the function is constant everywhere once it's locally constant, but in this case, we show directly that the difference over any interval is zero.\n\nSo the formatted problem would list the assumptions based on the problem statement. The original problem states that f'(x) = 0 for all x in (a, b), and we need to prove f is constant. The assumptions are the differentiability of f on (a, b) and the derivative being zero everywhere. The problem is to prove f is constant under these conditions without using MVT or Rolle's.",
