    "Content": "a) Let $a>0$ and the sequence $x_n$ fulfills $x_1>0$ and $x_{n+1}=\\frac{1}{2}(x_n + \\frac{a}{x_n})$ for $n \\in \\mathbb N$ . Show that $x_n \\rightarrow \\sqrt a$ when $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ . I have done it in two ways, but I guess I'm not allowed to use the first one and the second one is incomplete. Can someone please help me? We already know $x_n \\rightarrow \\sqrt a$ , so we do another step of the iteration and see that $x_{n+1} = \\sqrt a$ . Using limit, $x_n \\rightarrow x, x_{n+1} \\rightarrow x$ (this is the part I think it's incomplete, don't I have to show $x_{n+1} \\rightarrow x$ , how?), we have that $$x = \\frac x 2 (1 + \\frac a {x^2}) \\Rightarrow 1 = a/x^2 \\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt a$$ b) Let the sequence $x_n$ be defined as $x_{n+1}= 1 + \\frac 1 {x_n} (n \\in \\mathbb N), x_1=1$ . Show that it converges and calculate its limit. \"Tip: Show that sequences $x_{2n}$ and $x_{2n+1}$ monotone convergent to the limit.\"\nI didn't understand the tip, how can this help me? Does it make a difference if the number is odd or even? Thanks in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(a) Yes, you need to show first that $\\langle x_n\\rangle_n$ is convergent; once you know that, your argument shows that its limit must be $\\sqrt a$. You might want to look first at the discussion below for (b). (b) Yes, it does make a difference whether $n$ is odd or even. Calculate the first few values: $$x_1=1, x_2 = 2,x_3=\\frac32,x_4=\\frac53,x_5=\\frac85,x_6=\\frac{13}8.$$ Note that the sequence is oscillating: the odd-numbered terms are low, and the even-numbered terms are high. On the other hand, $x_1<x_3<x_5$, and $x_2>x_4>x_6$. This suggests that the sequence does converge to some limit $x$ in such a way that $$x_1<x_3<x_5<\\dots <x<\\dots<x_6<x_4<x_2\\;.$$ If you can show that $x_{2n+1}<x_{2n+3}<x_2$ for all $n\\ge 0$, you’ll know that the sequence of odd-numbered is monotone increasing and bounded above, which implies that it converges to some $x_{\\text{odd}}$. Similarly, if you can show that $x_1<x_{2n+2}<x_{2n}$ for every $n\\ge 1$, you’ll know that the sequence of even-numbered terms is monotone decreasing and bounded below, which implies that it converges to some $x_{\\text{even}}$. Then you’ll have to find a way to show that $x_{\\text{odd}}=x_{\\text{even}}$. (By the way, the terms of this sequence are the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and their limit is $\\varphi = \\frac12(1+\\sqrt 5)$.) Added: After some algebra we get $$x_{n+2}=1+\\frac1{x_{n+1}}=1+\\left(1+\\frac1{x_n}\\right)^{-1}=\\frac{2x_n+1}{x_n+1}$$ and $$x_{n+4}=\\frac{5x_n+3}{3x_n+2}\\;.$$ Thus, $$\\begin{align*}\nx_{n+4}<x_{n+2}&\\text{ iff } \\frac{5x_n+3}{3x_n+2}<\\frac{2x_n+1}{x_n+1}\\\\\n&\\text{ iff }5x_n^2+8x_n+3<6x_n^2+7x_n+2\\\\\n&\\text{ iff }0<x_n^2-x_n-1\\\\\n&\\text{ iff }2x_n+1<x_n^2+x_n\\\\\n&\\text{ iff }x_{n+2}<x_n\n\\end{align*}\\tag{1}$$ Since $x_4=\\frac53<2=x_2$, it follows by induction from $(1)$ that $\\langle x_{2n}:n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+\\rangle$ is a decreasing sequence. The calculation in $(1)$ remains valid if all of the inequalities are turned around, and $x_3=\\frac32>1=x_1$, so essentially the same induction shows that $\\langle x_{2n-1}:n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+\\rangle$ is a decreasing sequence. Now let $\\varphi=\\frac12(1+\\sqrt 5)$, the positive zero of $x^2-x-1$. Note that if $x$ is a positive real number, $x>\\varphi$ iff $x^2-x-1>0$. Moreover, $$\\begin{align*}\nx_{n+2}^2-x_{n+2}-1&=\\left(\\frac{2x_n+1}{x_n+1}\\right)^2-\\frac{2x_n+1}{x_n+1}-1\\\\\n&=\\frac{x_n^2-x_n-1}{(x_n+1)^2}\\;,\n\\end{align*}$$ and $(x_n+1)^2>0$, so $x_{n+2}^2-x_{n+2}-1$ and $x_n^2-x_n-1$ have the same algebraic sign, and therefore $x_{n+2}>\\varphi$ iff $x_n>\\varphi$. Now $\\varphi\\approx 1.618$, so $x_2>\\varphi$, and it follows by induction that $x_{2n}>\\varphi$ for every $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+$. Similarly, $x<\\varphi$ iff $x^2-x-1<0$ if $x$ is a positive real, and $x_1=1<\\varphi$, so the same induction shows that $x_{2n-1}<\\varphi$ for every $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+$. Thus, $$x_1<x_3<x_5<\\dots <\\varphi<\\dots<x_6<x_4<x_2\\;.$$ In particular, the sequence of odd-numbered terms is increasing and bounded above by $\\varphi$, and the sequence of even-numbered terms is decreasing and bounded below by $\\varphi$, so both have limits. This doesn’t yet prove that both subsequences have the same limit, but we’re getting there. There are several ways to finish the job. One is to let $L$ be the limit of one of the subsequences, say the even-numbered one. Then $$L=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}x_{2n+2}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{2x_{2n}+1}{x_{2n}+1}=\\frac{2L+1}{L+1}\\;,$$ so $L^2+L=2L+1$, $L^2-L-1=0$, and $L=\\varphi$ (since the negative solution is plainly wrong). A similar calculation takes care of the other subsequence. Another approach is to consider $$\\left|\\frac{x_{n+2}-x_{n+1}}{x_{n+1}-x_n}\\right|=\\left|\\frac{\\frac{5x_n+3}{3x_n+2}-\\frac{2x_n+1}{x_n+1}}{\\frac{2x_n+1}{x_n+1}-x_n}\\right|=\\left|\\frac1{3x_n+2}\\right|=\\frac1{3x_n+2}<\\frac12,$$ since the $x_n$ are all positive. In other words, the gap between consecutive terms shrinks at least geometrically and therefore tends to $0$, so the two subsequences must actually have the same limit, and it must satisfy $L=\\frac1{L+1}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully. The user has two parts, a) and b). Each part seems to be a separate problem, so I should handle them individually.\n\nStarting with part a). The problem is about proving that the sequence generated by the Babylonian method converges to the square root of a. The user mentions some steps they took but feels their approach might be incomplete. The original problem states:\n\n\"a) Let a>0 and the sequence x_n fulfills x_1>0 and x_{n+1}=1/2(x_n + a/x_n) for n in N. Show that x_n → sqrt(a) as n→infty.\"\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The assumptions here are that 'a' is a positive real number, the initial term x_1 is positive, and the recursive formula is given. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property per object. \n\nFor part a), the assumptions would be:\n- a is a positive real number.\n- x_1 is a positive real number.\n- The sequence is defined by x_{n+1} = (1/2)(x_n + a/x_n) for all natural numbers n.\n\nThe problem is to show that x_n converges to sqrt(a) as n approaches infinity.\n\nNow for part b). The problem is about another sequence defined by x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/x_n with x_1 = 1. The task is to show convergence and compute the limit. The tip suggests looking at the even and odd subsequences. The user is confused about how this helps. \n\nAssumptions for part b):\n- The sequence is defined by x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/x_n for all natural numbers n.\n- x_1 = 1.\n\nThe problem here is to show that the sequence converges and calculate its limit. The tip about even and odd subsequences is part of the problem's guidance, so maybe it's included as part of the problem statement or as an additional note. But according to the example, the problem should include the main question. The tip is part of the original question, so it should be included in the problem statement.\n\nNow, I need to structure each part separately as per the format. The user provided an example where each problem was handled with its own assumptions and problem statement. So, even though the original post has two parts, I should format each part as a separate problem under the same question. Wait, but in the example, the user only had one problem. Let me check the instructions again.\n\nThe user's example shows that the original problem was a single question, which was formatted into assumptions and problem. Here, the original problem has two parts, a) and b). The instructions say to \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example has one problem. So perhaps each part a) and b) should be treated as separate problems with their own assumptions and problem statements.\n\nTherefore, I should format part a) and part b) as separate entries. Let me check the original problem's text again. The user posted both parts as separate items under the same question. However, in the example given by the user, the original problem was a single problem. So perhaps the correct approach is to split them into two separate problems. But the user's example includes only one problem. Let me see how the user wants it.\n\nThe user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" where the example has a single problem. Therefore, if the original problem on Math Stack Exchange contains multiple parts, each part should be formatted separately. So, in this case, part a) and part b) each become their own problem with their own assumptions and problem statements.\n\nSo, for part a):\n\nAssumptions:\n- a is a positive real number.\n- x_1 is a positive real number.\n- For each natural number n, x_{n+1} = (1/2)(x_n + a/x_n).\n\nProblem: Show that x_n converges to sqrt(a) as n approaches infinity.\n\nFor part b):\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sequence is defined by x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/x_n for each natural number n.\n- x_1 = 1.\n\nProblem: Show that the sequence converges and calculate its limit. Tip: Show that the subsequences x_{2n} and x_{2n+1} are monotonically convergent to the limit.\n\nWait, the tip is part of the original problem's question, so it should be included in the problem statement. However, in the example, the original problem's tip (like the divisibility by 7) is part of the assumptions. But in this case, the tip is a hint on how to approach the problem. The example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, but in this case, the problem includes a tip. The user instructions say to \"filter the unrelated informations\", so maybe the tip is considered part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nThus, in part b), the problem should include the tip as part of the problem statement. So the problem is: \"Show that it converges and calculate its limit. Tip: Show that sequences x_{2n} and x_{2n+1} are monotonic and convergent to the limit.\"\n\nBut the original question in part b) says: \"Show that it converges and calculate its limit. 'Tip: Show that sequences x_{2n} and x_{2n+1} monotone convergent to the limit.' I didn't understand the tip...\" So the tip is part of the problem's instructions, so should be included in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, formatting each part separately:\n\nPart a)\nAssumption: \n- a is a positive real number,\n- x_1 is a positive real number,\n- For each natural number n, x_{n+1} is defined as (1/2)(x_n + a/x_n).\n\nProblem: Show that x_n converges to sqrt(a) as n approaches infinity.\n\nPart b)\nAssumption:\n- The sequence x_n is defined by x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/x_n for each natural number n,\n- x_1 = 1.\n\nProblem: Show that the sequence converges and calculate its limit. Tip: Show that the subsequences x_{2n} and x_{2n+1} are monotonic and converge to the same limit.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property of one object. So in part a), each assumption is a separate line. Similarly for part b).\n\nSo the final formatted problems would be:\n\nFor part a):\n\nAssumption:\na is a positive real number,\nx₁ is a positive real number,\nFor each natural number n, x_{n+1} = (1/2)(xₙ + a/xₙ).\n\nProblem:\nShow that xₙ converges to √a as n approaches infinity.\n\nFor part b):\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence xₙ is defined by x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/xₙ for each natural number n,\nx₁ = 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence converges and calculate its limit. Tip: Show that the subsequences x_{2n} and x_{2n+1} are monotonic and converge to the limit.\n\nBut I need to check if the assumptions are correctly separated. For part a), the first assumption is a > 0, second is x₁ > 0, third is the recursive definition. Each is a separate line. Similarly for part b), first assumption is the recursive definition, second is x₁ = 1.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The example had assumptions each on separate lines, each addressing one condition. So that's the format to follow.",
