    "Content": "Using basic calculus, I can prove that $f(t)=t-1-\\log t \\geq 0$ for $t > 0$ by setting the first derivative to zero\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{df}{dt} = 1 - 1/t = 0\n\\end{align}\nAnd so I have a critical point at $t=1$ and $f(1)=0$. Then I calculate the second derivative $\\frac{d^2f}{dt^2} = 1/t^2 \\geq 0$ meaning that $f$ is a convex function with a minimum value of 0 so $f \\geq 0$ for $t > 0$. However, something in my gut tells me there's a way to prove this without even using the first or any derivative of $f$. I've been thinking about this for a while and I haven't been able to do this. Question is: can you prove $f\\geq 0$ without relying on any derivatives of $f$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "With the definition of $\\log t$ as an integral. We can define \n$$\\log t = \\int_1^t \\frac{1}{x}\\,dx.$$\nThe function $\\frac{1}{x}$ is decreasing, so a left hand sum approximation is always an over estimate, and a right hand sum approximation is always an underestimate. Dividing the interval $[1,t]$ into a single interval of length $t-1$ and evaluating at the left endpoint, we get\n$$\\ln(t) = \\int_1^t\\frac{1}{x}dx \\leq f(1)(t-1) = t-1$$\ngiving the desired inequality. If $0\\lt t\\lt 1$, then we first switch limits and use a right hand sum with one interval we get:\n$$\\ln(t) = \\int_1^t\\frac{1}{x}dx = -\\int_t^1\\frac{1}{x}dx \\leq -f(1)(1-t) = t-1$$\n(we have $\\int_t^1\\frac{1}{x}dx \\geq f(1)(1-t)$ since the right hand sum is an underestimate), so multiplying by $-1$ gives the inequality above), giving the desired inequality again. If $t=1$, the inequality reduces to $0\\geq \\log(1)$, which is of course true. With exponentials. $t-1-\\log t\\geq 0$ if and only if $\\log t\\leq t-1$, if and only if $t \\leq e^{t-1}$. With the Taylor series definition of $e^t$. Since\n$$e^x = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\cdots$$\nthen\n$$e^{t-1} = 1 + (t-1) + \\frac{(t-1)^2}{2!} + \\frac{(t-1)^3}{3!} + \\cdots.$$\nIf $t\\geq 1$, then $e^{t-1}\\geq 1+(t-1) = t$, giving the desired inequality. If $0\\lt t\\lt 1$, then we have an alternating series\n$$ \\frac{(t-1)^2}{2!} + \\frac{(t-1)^3}{3!} + \\frac{(t-1)^4}{4!}+\\cdots$$\nwith ever decreasing terms:\n$$\\frac{|t-1|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \\lt \\frac{|t-1|^n}{n!} \\Longleftrightarrow |t-1|\\lt n+1,$$\nwhich holds because $n\\geq 2$ and $|t-1|\\lt 1$. Thus, the \"tail\" (starting in the quadratic term) of the series is positive, so $e^{t-1} \\geq 1+(t-1) = t$ still holds, giving the desired inequality as well. With the definition of $e^t$ as a limit. We have\n$$e^x = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n$$\nso\n$$e^{t-1} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1 + \\frac{t-1}{n}\\right)^n.$$\nIf $t\\geq 1$, the sequence is nondecreasing (we are compounding interest, so the more often we compound the bigger the payoff). In particular, $e^{t-1}\\geq 1 +\\frac{t-1}{1} = t$, giving the desired inequality. If $0\\lt t \\lt 1$, then we have \n$$e^{t-1} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1 - \\frac{1-t}{n}\\right)^n.$$\nAgain, the sequence is increasing (this is like paying off a debt with fixed interest; if you pay down the capital more often, your total interest will be smaller in the end). So again we have $e^{t-1} \\geq 1 - \\frac{1-t}{1} = t$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the key assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe title is \"Proof that t−1−log t ≥ 0 for t > 0\". The user wants to prove that the function f(t) = t - 1 - log t is non-negative for all positive t. They mention using calculus by checking the first and second derivatives, but they want a proof without using derivatives.\n\nNow, looking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the original example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, for the current problem, the main conditions are:\n\n1. t is a real number (since we're dealing with log t, t must be positive, but the problem states t > 0 explicitly).\n2. The function f(t) = t - 1 - log t is defined for t > 0.\n3. The proof should not use derivatives of f.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking to prove f(t) ≥ 0 for t > 0 without using derivatives. So the key assumptions would be the domain of t and the restriction on the method (no derivatives). However, the example provided structured assumptions related to the problem's conditions, not the method. The method restriction is part of the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the example, in the original problem, the user had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem listed those as assumptions. The problem statement then was to prove the divisibility.\n\nIn the current case, the problem's assumptions would relate to t being greater than 0. The method restriction (no derivatives) is part of the problem's instruction, not an assumption about the variables or functions. So in the \"Assumption\" section, we should list the conditions on t and f(t). The method restriction is part of the problem's query.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n- t is a positive real number (t > 0).\n- f(t) is defined as t - 1 - log t.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f(t) ≥ 0 for all t > 0 without using derivatives of f.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those two assumptions, and the problem statement includes the inequality and the method restriction.\n\nLet me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the assumptions are the conditions on n. Similarly, here, the assumptions are the conditions on t and the definition of f(t). The problem is to prove f(t) ≥ 0 with the additional constraint of not using derivatives.\n\nSo I think the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nt is a positive real number,\nf(t) = t - 1 - \\log t.\nProblem:\nProve that f(t) \\geq 0 for all t > 0 without using derivatives of f.\n\nThat seems to fit the format. The method restriction is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Assumptions are about the variables and functions involved.",
