    "Content": "This is actually an exercise from Apostol's Mathematical Analysis.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Anybody know a proof of ∏_{n=1}^∞cos(x/2^n)=sin x/x.\" The user mentions that it's an exercise from Apostol's Mathematical Analysis, Chapter 8 Exercise 42. They first had to show that the infinite product converges for all real x, which they've done. Now, they need to find the value it converges to, and they found via Wolfram Alpha that it's sin(x)/x. They can't figure out the proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem is about proving that the infinite product of cos(x/2^n) from n=1 to infinity equals sin(x)/x. The user already handled the convergence part, so the main problem is establishing the equality. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are specific conditions. Here, the product is over n starting at 1 to infinity, and each term is cos(x divided by 2^n). The problem is to prove that this product equals sin(x)/x. \n\nSo, the assumptions should list each condition. The first assumption is that the product is from n=1 to infinity. The second is that each term in the product is cos(x/2^n). The third is that x is a real number (since the exercise asks for real x). Wait, but in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the variables involved are x being real, and the product terms being cos(x/2^n). However, the original problem already states that the product converges for all real x, so maybe the assumption is that x is real. Also, the product is an infinite product starting at n=1.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The product is taken from n=1 to infinity.\n- Each term of the product is cos(x/(2^n)).\n- x is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that the product equals sin(x)/x.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the product's index is n, which is an integer starting at 1, so n is a positive integer. But perhaps that's implicit in the product notation. The original problem says \"for all real x\", so x being real is an important condition. Also, the product terms are defined as cos(x/2^n), so x is divided by 2^n for each term.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The product is taken over all positive integers n starting from 1 to infinity.\n2. Each term in the product is cos(x/2^n).\n3. x is a real number.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since the problem is about proving an equality, the main assumptions are the conditions under which the equality holds. Since the user already established convergence for all real x, the problem is to show that when it converges, it equals sin(x)/x. So maybe the assumption is that x is a real number (since convergence is already handled), and the terms are as defined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are the structure of the product and the domain of x. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in that problem, the original question was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had n divisible by 7 as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the user might have made a mistake, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example given was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. That might have been a mistake in the example. So perhaps the user wants the assistant to extract the necessary conditions from the problem, even if they are general. Maybe in that example, there was a misinterpretation.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question is to prove that the infinite product equals sin(x)/x. The problem already assumes that the product converges for all real x, so perhaps the key assumptions are that x is real and the product is as defined. Therefore, the assumptions should list:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The product is over n from 1 to infinity.\n- Each term in the product is cos(x/2^n).\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equality. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe product is taken over all positive integers n starting from 1,\neach term of the product is cos(x/(2^n)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}.$$\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that the product converges for all real x is part of the problem's conditions, but since the user mentions that they already showed convergence, but the problem here is to find the value. However, in the example, the assumption included a condition (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example.\n\nBut in this current problem, the user's question is to prove the product equals sinx/x, given that it converges for all real x. So the key assumptions are that x is real and the product is defined as such. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those assumptions.",
