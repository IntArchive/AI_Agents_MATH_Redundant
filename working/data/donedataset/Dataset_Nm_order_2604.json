    "Content": "I got started recently on proofs about continuity and so on. So to start working with this on $n$-spaces I've selected to prove that every linear function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ is continuous at every $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Since I'm just getting started with this kind of proof I just want to know if my proof is okay or if there's any inconsistency. My proof is as follows: Since $f$ is linear, we know that there's some $k\\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(x)|\\leq k|x|$ for every $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, in that case let $a\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $\\varepsilon >0$. Consider $\\delta = \\varepsilon /k$ and suppose $|x-a|<\\delta$, in that case we have: $$|f(x)-f(a)|=|f(x-a)|\\leq k |x-a|<k \\frac{\\varepsilon}{k}=\\varepsilon$$ And since $|x-a|<\\delta$ implies $|f(x)-f(a)|<\\varepsilon$ we have that $f$ is continuous at $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $a$ was arbitrary, $f$ is continous in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Is this proof fine? Or there was something I've missed on the way?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This proof is correct modulo result you stated in the begining, i.e. \n$$\n\\text{there exist $k\\in\\mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(x)|\\leq k|x|$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$}\n$$\nProof of this fact is much more interesting and uses compactness of unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition line by line, addressing one property per object, and then the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Proof that a linear transformation is continuous.\" The question is about proving that every linear function f: R^n → R^m is continuous at every a in R^n. The user presented their proof and is asking if it's correct or if there are any issues.\n\nLooking at the assumptions: The problem states that f is a linear function between R^n and R^m. The user's proof uses the fact that linear transformations have a bound k such that |f(x)| ≤ k|x| for all x. The key assumptions here would be the properties of f and the spaces involved.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions line by line:\n1. f is a linear function.\n2. The domain of f is R^n.\n3. The codomain of f is R^m.\n4. The problem considers continuity at every point a in R^n.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that this linear transformation f is continuous at every a in R^n.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions that f is linear, so that's one assumption. The domain and codomain are part of the function's definition, so those should be separate assumptions. Also, the continuity is to be proven for every a in R^n, but that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The example given in the user's example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were specific conditions. Here, the main assumptions are the linearity of f and the spaces it's acting between. \n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n- f is a linear transformation.\n- f maps from R^n to R^m.\n- The continuity is to be proven at every point a in R^n (but this is part of the problem, not an assumption). Wait, no. The problem is to prove continuity at every a, so that's the problem statement. The assumptions are the given conditions. So the assumptions here are the properties of f (linearity, domain, codomain). The problem is to show continuity everywhere.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n1. f is a linear function.\n2. The domain of f is ℝ^n.\n3. The codomain of f is ℝ^m.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that f is continuous at every a ∈ ℝ^n.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions included specific conditions on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the key given conditions are that f is linear and between those spaces. So each of those is a separate assumption. The problem is then to prove continuity at every point. I think that's correct. The user's proof uses the fact that linear maps between finite-dimensional spaces are bounded, which is a key property, but the assumptions are just the linearity and the spaces.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a linear function,\nf has domain ℝ^n,\nf has codomain ℝ^m.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous at every a ∈ ℝ^n.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement is: \"every linear function f: ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ is continuous at every a ∈ ℝⁿ.\" So the problem is to prove that, given f is linear and maps between those spaces. So the assumptions are exactly those two: f is linear, domain ℝⁿ, codomain ℝᵐ.\n\nAlternatively, the domain and codomain can be considered as part of the function's definition, so perhaps each as separate assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Each is a separate condition on the same object. Here, the function f has three properties: linearity, domain, codomain. But domain and codomain are part of its definition. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ is a linear function.\n\nBut the example splits different properties into separate lines. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from ℝⁿ to ℝᵐ,\nf is linear.\n\nBut perhaps the first one is \"f is a linear function with domain ℝⁿ and codomain ℝᵐ.\" However, the example had two separate conditions on n. Since the user's example splits different properties into separate lines, even if they apply to the same object, I should follow that. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a linear function,\nf has domain ℝⁿ,\nf has codomain ℝᵐ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous at every a ∈ ℝⁿ.\n\nThat seems to fit the format. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. The function f has three properties here: being linear, having domain ℝⁿ, and codomain ℝᵐ. Each on a separate line. The problem is to prove continuity at every point in the domain.\n\nI think that's correct. The original question didn't have any other hidden assumptions. The user's proof uses the boundedness of linear maps on finite-dimensional spaces, which is a theorem, but that's part of the reasoning, not an assumption of the problem. The problem's assumptions are just the linearity and the spaces.",
