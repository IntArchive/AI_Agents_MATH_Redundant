    "Content": "I'd like to construct a closed but not exact $n-1$-form $\\omega$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n\\setminus\\{0\\}$ in analogy to the winding form: $$\\frac{x~dy-y~dx}{x^2+y^2}$$ I think something like $$\\omega=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(\\star dx_i)}{(x_1^2+\\dots+x_n^2)^{n/2}}$$ should probably work. $\\star$ is the hodge star operator, for example $\\star dx_1=dx_2\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx_n$ and $\\star dx_2=-dx_1\\wedge dx_3\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx_n$. $\\omega$ is closed since $$d\\omega=\\sum_{i=1}^nd\\left(\\frac{ x_i}{(x_1^2+\\dots+x_n^2)^{n/2}}\\right)\\wedge\\star dx_i=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(\\sum x_j^2)^{n/2}-n x_i^2 (\\sum x_j^2)^{n/2-1}}{(\\sum x_j^2)^{n}} dx_1\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx_n=0$$\nNow it remains to show that $\\omega$ is not exact. I guess a direct computation is not the way to do it. I thought about assuming that there exists $d\\eta=\\omega$ and then using Stoke's theorem to get the contradiction $0\\not=\\int_{S^{n-1}}\\omega=\\int_\\emptyset                                                                      \\eta=0$. Two questions about this: Is the general argument correct? How to prove $0\\not=\\int_{S^{n-1}}\\omega$? I guess a direct computation using generalized sphere coordinates is rather tedious.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, this is a reasonable way to go about things. Let $\\psi=\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (\\star dx_i)$. Then $\\left.\\psi\\right|_{S^{n-1}}=\\left.\\omega\\right|_{S^{n-1}}$, and so $\\int_{S^{n-1}} \\omega = \\int_{S^{n-1}} \\psi$.\nMoreover, $d\\psi$ is a constant multiple of the volume form on $\\Bbb{R}^n$. Now, apply Stokes' theorem to $B^n$ and $S^{n-1}$...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to construct a closed but not exact (n-1)-form on ℝⁿ\\{0}, similar to the winding form in 2D. They propose a specific form using the Hodge star operator. The main tasks are to verify that their form ω is closed but not exact. \n\nFirst, for assumptions. The problem is set on ℝⁿ\\{0}, so n must be at least 2? Wait, the original winding form is on ℝ²\\{0}, so here it's generalized to n dimensions. So the space is ℝⁿ without the origin. Then, ω is an (n-1)-form. The user has already shown that dω = 0, so ω is closed. The remaining part is to show it's not exact. \n\nThe user suggests using Stokes' theorem by integrating ω over the (n-1)-sphere and showing the integral isn't zero, which would contradict exactness since the sphere has no boundary. So the integral over Sⁿ⁻¹ of ω should be non-zero. But how to compute that integral without messy coordinates?\n\nIn the example given by the user, the key assumptions would include properties about the space (ℝⁿ\\{0}), the form being (n-1)-form, and maybe the use of Stokes' theorem. Let me list each assumption line by line.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The space is ℝⁿ \\ {0} (where n is a positive integer? Probably n ≥ 2 since for n=1, ℝ¹\\{0} is two disconnected lines, but the form would be a 0-form, maybe not interesting here).\n- ω is an (n−1)-form defined on ℝⁿ \\ {0}.\n- ω is given by ω = [sum x_i (⋆ dx_i)] / (x₁² + … + x_n²)^{n/2}.\n- The Hodge star operator ⋆ is defined such that ⋆dx_i alternates signs appropriately (as in the example: ⋆dx₁ = dx₂∧…∧dx_n, ⋆dx₂ = -dx₁∧dx₃∧…∧dx_n, etc.).\n- The user has shown that dω = 0, hence ω is closed.\n- The problem is to show that ω is not exact.\n- The approach suggested is to use Stokes' theorem: if ω were exact, then its integral over Sⁿ⁻¹ (which is compact without boundary) would be zero, but the user needs to show that the integral is non-zero.\n\nWait, in the problem description, the user mentions two questions: 1) Is their general argument (using Stokes) correct? 2) How to prove the integral is non-zero? So the problem is about validating the argument and computing the integral. But the original problem statement is to construct such a form and show it's closed but not exact. So maybe the formatted problem should reflect that.\n\nBut in the example given, the assistant extracted the key assumptions and the problem. Here, the user's problem is to confirm their approach is correct and to compute the integral. However, the original task was to structure the problem as per the example. So perhaps the problem is \"Prove that ω is closed but not exact,\" and the assumptions include the definition of ω, the space, etc.\n\nBut let's look at the example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, but the user had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user said \"for every integer n,\" but in the example, the assistant wrote an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps in the example, maybe the user made a mistake? Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But 91 is 7*13. The assistant's formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that was a mistake? Or perhaps the original problem was miswritten. Hmm, maybe the example is not the best, but perhaps the user intended to include some assumption. Anyway, following the instructions, I need to structure the current problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, the user is constructing an (n-1)-form ω on ℝⁿ\\{0}, closed but not exact. They showed ω is closed, now need to show it's not exact. The problem is to do that, and the user is asking if their Stokes' theorem approach is correct and how to compute the integral.\n\nSo formatted problem should list the assumptions first. Let's list each assumption line by line. Each line should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The space is ℝⁿ \\ {0}, where n is a positive integer.\n- ω is an (n−1)-form on ℝⁿ \\ {0}.\n- ω is defined as ω = (∑_{i=1}^n x_i (⋆ dx_i)) / (x₁² + … + x_n²)^{n/2}.\n- The Hodge star operator ⋆ acts on dx_i such that ⋆dx_i = (-1)^{i+1} dx₁ ∧ … ∧ dx_{i-1} ∧ dx_{i+1} ∧ … ∧ dx_n (or similar sign conventions).\n- dω = 0, so ω is closed.\n- If ω were exact, there would exist an (n−2)-form η such that dη = ω.\n- S^{n−1} is the unit (n−1)-sphere embedded in ℝⁿ \\ {0}.\n- Stokes' theorem applies to manifolds without boundary, such as S^{n−1}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ω is not exact by proving that ∫_{S^{n−1}} ω ≠ 0, thereby contradicting the existence of such η via Stokes' theorem.\n\nWait, but the user's two questions are whether the general argument (using Stokes) is correct and how to prove the integral is non-zero. So maybe the problem is twofold, but according to the format, it should be the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as posed is to show that ω is not exact, using the argument involving Stokes' theorem and the integral over the sphere.\n\nSo perhaps the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is ℝⁿ \\ {0},\nω is an (n−1)-form on ℝⁿ \\ {0},\nω is defined as ω = (∑_{i=1}^n x_i (⋆ dx_i)) / (x₁² + … + x_n²)^{n/2},\ndω = 0,\nS^{n−1} is the unit (n−1)-sphere,\nStokes' theorem applies to S^{n−1}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ω is not exact by showing ∫_{S^{n−1}} ω ≠ 0.\n\nBut need to ensure each assumption is one line per property. Let me check each point:\n\n- \"The space is ℝⁿ \\ {0}\" – that's one assumption.\n- \"ω is an (n−1)-form on ℝⁿ \\ {0}\" – another.\n- \"ω is defined as [formula]\" – another.\n- \"dω = 0\" – another (since ω is closed).\n- \"S^{n−1} is the unit (n−1)-sphere embedded in ℝⁿ \\ {0}\" – maybe.\n- \"Stokes' theorem holds for integration over S^{n−1}\" – perhaps, but Stokes' theorem applies to compact manifolds with boundary, but S^{n−1} is compact without boundary, so integrating an exact form over it would give zero.\n\nBut the user is assuming Stokes' theorem, so perhaps that's part of the argument, not an assumption. So maybe the key assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is ℝⁿ \\ {0},\nω is an (n−1)-form on ℝⁿ \\ {0},\nω is defined as ω = (∑_{i=1}^n x_i (⋆ dx_i)) / (x₁² + … + x_n²)^{n/2},\nThe Hodge star operator ⋆ is defined with the standard orientation,\ndω = 0,\nS^{n−1} is a compact oriented manifold without boundary.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ω is not exact by demonstrating that ∫_{S^{n−1}} ω ≠ 0.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's main questions are about validating the Stokes' argument and computing the integral, the problem might be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nω is a closed (n−1)-form on ℝⁿ \\ {0},\nS^{n−1} is the unit sphere in ℝⁿ \\ {0},\nStokes' theorem applies to S^{n−1}.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ω is not exact by showing ∫_{S^{n−1}} ω ≠ 0.\n\nBut perhaps more precise to list all necessary assumptions. The Hodge star definition is part of ω's construction. Also, that ω is closed is already shown by the user, so that's an assumption here. The problem is to show it's not exact.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe space is $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$,\n$\\omega$ is an $(n-1)$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$,\n$\\omega$ is defined as $\\omega = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (\\star dx_i)}{(x_1^2 + \\dots + x_n^2)^{n/2}}$,\n$d\\omega = 0$,\n$S^{n-1}$ is the unit $(n-1)$-sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$,\nStokes' theorem applies to $S^{n-1}$.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\omega$ is not exact by showing $\\int_{S^{n-1}} \\omega \\neq 0$.\n###",
