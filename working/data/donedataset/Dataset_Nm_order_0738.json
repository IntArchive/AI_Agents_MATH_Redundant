    "AcceptedAnswer": "This problem can be recast in terms of the famous problem of the number of ways to represent a positive integer as a sum of squares .  With this perspective, we can see that the following more general statement is true for any $p > 1$ (so that each of the infinite series actually converges):\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(n^2)^p} + \\sum_{m,n = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(m^2+n^2)^p}  = \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^p}\\right).$$ The left-hand side is\n$$\\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n_2(s)}{s^p},$$ where $n_2(s)$ is the number of ways of representing $s$ as the sum of one or of two squares of positive integers, in which order is distinguished (i.e., $1^2 + 2^2$ is counted separately from $2^2+1^2$). It is known that $n_2(s) = d_1(s) - d_3(s)$ (see eq. 24 in the site linked above), where $d_k(s)$ is the number of divisors of $s$ congruent to $k \\bmod 4$. The first sum on the right side of the equation has (the $p$th powers of) all positive integers as denominators and the second sum on the right has (the $p$th powers of) all odd numbers as denominators.  After multiplying those sums together, then, $1/s^p$ (ignoring signs) appears on the right as many times as there are odd divisors of $s$.  Each odd divisor of $s$ congruent to $1 \\bmod 4$ contributes a $+1/s^p$, and each odd divisor of $s$ congruent to congruent to $3 \\bmod 4$ contributes a $-1/s^p$.  Thus the coefficient of $1/s^p$ on the right side is exactly $d_1(s) - d_3(s)$.  Therefore, the right-hand side is also \n$$\\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n_2(s)}{s^p}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So the user wants to prove that the double sum of 1 over (m² + n²) squared from m,n=1 to infinity equals ζ(2) times Catalan's constant minus ζ(4). They also mention that ζ is the Riemann zeta function and G is Catalan's constant. The right side is given as π²/6 times G minus π⁴/90.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. The main equation is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m,n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(m^2 + n^2)^2} = \\zeta(2) G - \\zeta(4)\n$$\n\nWhere ζ(2) is π²/6 and ζ(4) is π⁴/90, so that's consistent with the right-hand side expression.\n\nAssumptions here would be that m and n are positive integers starting from 1, since the summation is from 1 to infinity. The problem is to prove this equality. The user tried reverse engineering but couldn't solve it, so they need hints or references.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The left-hand side is a double sum over m and n of 1/(m² + n²)². The right-hand side involves products of zeta functions and Catalan's constant.\n\nFirst, maybe I can recall that sums over m and n of 1/(m² + n²)^k can sometimes be related to zeta functions or other special functions. However, in this case, the exponent is 2, so k=2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express this double sum as an integral. Since 1/(m² + n²)^2 can be written using an integral involving exponentials. For example, using the gamma function or beta function integral representation. Wait, there's a formula: 1/A² = ∫_0^∞ t e^{-At} dt, for A > 0. So maybe substituting that into the sum.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m,n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(m^2 + n^2)^2} = \\sum_{m,n=1}^\\infty \\int_0^\\infty t e^{-(m^2 + n^2)t} dt\n$$\n\nThen, interchange sum and integral (if allowed by convergence):\n\n$$\n= \\int_0^\\infty t \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty e^{-m^2 t} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty e^{-n^2 t} \\right) dt\n$$\n\nWhich is:\n\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty t \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty e^{-n^2 t} \\right)^2 dt\n$$\n\nBut the square of the sum would include terms where m and n are the same or different. Wait, but maybe this approach is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using Fourier analysis or Poisson summation formula, since sums over lattices often relate to theta functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using polar coordinates or some decomposition. Wait, since m and n are integers, this is a sum over the lattice points in the first quadrant, except the axes (since m,n start at 1). Each term is 1/(m² + n²)^2. So this is like summing over all pairs (m,n) in the positive integers of the reciprocal of the square of their Euclidean norm squared. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, note that ζ(2) is the sum over n ≥1 1/n², and G is the sum over n≥0 (-1)^n/(2n+1)^2. So the product ζ(2)G would be a double sum: sum_{m=1}^\\infty sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k / (m² (2k+1)^2 ). But how does that relate to the original double sum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the original sum as a product of sums? But the original sum is over m and n, but the denominator is (m² + n²)^2, which complicates things. If it were m² * n², it would be ζ(2)^2, but here it's m² + n².\n\nAnother idea: maybe use symmetry. Since the sum is over all m,n ≥1, we can consider m ≠ n and m = n, but not sure if that helps. Alternatively, use some integral transforms.\n\nWait, perhaps consider expanding 1/(m² + n²)^2 as an integral. For example, using the identity:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(m^2 + n^2)^2} = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\frac{dx dy}{(m^2 + n^2 + x + y)^3}\n$$\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that 1/(m² + n²)^2 can be expressed as a derivative. For example, differentiating with respect to m² + n². Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the sum as a sum over all pairs (m,n) ≥1 of 1/(m² + n²)^2. Perhaps relate this to the sum over all Gaussian integers (m + ni)^2, but since we are dealing with squared norms, which would be (m² + n²)^2. But the reciprocal of that. So maybe Eisenstein series or something related to complex analysis? But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand the sum in terms of zeta functions by considering the double sum as a product of sums. Wait, but (m² + n²) is additive, not multiplicative. So that complicates things.\n\nWait, another approach: use the integral representation of 1/(m² + n²)^2. For example, using the fact that for a > 0,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{a^2} = \\int_0^\\infty t e^{-a t} dt\n$$\n\nWait, but here a is m² + n², so we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(m² + n²)^2} = \\int_0^\\infty t e^{-(m² + n²) t} dt\n$$\n\nSo substituting into the sum,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m,n=1}^\\infty \\int_0^\\infty t e^{-(m² + n²) t} dt = \\int_0^\\infty t \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty e^{-m² t} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty e^{-n² t} \\right) dt\n$$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty t \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty e^{-n² t} \\right)^2 dt\n$$\n\nNow, the sum inside the integral is related to the theta function. Recall that the Jacobi theta function is θ(t) = ∑_{n=-∞}^∞ e^{-π n² t}, but here we have ∑_{n=1}^∞ e^{-n² t} = (θ(t) - 1)/2, maybe? Wait, θ(t) as defined in some contexts is ∑_{n=-∞}^∞ e^{-π n² t}, but here the exponent is -n² t, not involving π. So maybe adjust variables.\n\nAlternatively, note that ∑_{n=1}^∞ e^{-n² t} = (θ(t) - 1)/2 where θ(t) is the theta function without the π factor. But perhaps I can express this sum in terms of known functions. However, integrating t times the square of this sum might not lead directly to known constants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the square into two sums:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty e^{-n² t} \\right)^2 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty e^{-(n² + m²) t}\n$$\n\nWhich brings us back to the original double sum. So this approach might be circular.\n\nHmm. Maybe another direction. Let's consider the double sum S = ∑_{m,n ≥1} 1/(m² + n²)^2. To compute this, perhaps use Fourier series or Parseval's identity. For example, consider functions on the torus or some periodic functions whose Fourier coefficients relate to m and n.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in 2D, the sum over m,n of 1/(m² + n²)^s is related to the Epstein zeta function. For s=2, this would be the case here. The Epstein zeta function Z(s) = ∑_{m,n} (m² + n²)^{-s}, where the sum is over all integers except (0,0). But in our problem, the sum is over m,n ≥1, so only the first quadrant. So perhaps express the original sum in terms of the Epstein zeta function. The full Epstein zeta function would include all four quadrants, so maybe S = 1/4 (Z(2) - some terms). Wait, let's see.\n\nThe full Epstein zeta function Z(s) = ∑_{(m,n)≠(0,0)} 1/(m² + n²)^s. This includes all pairs (m,n) except (0,0). So the sum over all m,n integers except (0,0). Our sum S is over m,n ≥1, which is 1/4 of the total sum if we consider all four quadrants where m and n are positive or negative. But actually, for each pair (m,n) in the first quadrant (m,n ≥1), there are four symmetric pairs: (m,n), (-m,n), (m,-n), (-m,-n). So the sum over all four quadrants would be 4S + the axes terms (where either m=0 or n=0 but not both). So Z(2) = 4S + 2 ∑_{m=1}^\\infty 1/m^4 + 2 ∑_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^4 + 0 (for (0,0)). But since m and n are symmetric, this is Z(2) = 4S + 4 ζ(4).\n\nHence, solving for S:\n\n4S = Z(2) - 4 ζ(4)\n\nSo S = (Z(2) - 4 ζ(4))/4\n\nBut then, if we can compute Z(2), we can find S.\n\nNow, the problem is to relate Z(2) to ζ(2) G - ζ(4). Wait, but according to the problem statement, S = ζ(2) G - ζ(4). So according to our previous equation:\n\n( Z(2) - 4 ζ(4) ) /4 = ζ(2) G - ζ(4)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\nZ(2) -4 ζ(4) = 4 ζ(2) G -4 ζ(4)\n\nTherefore, Z(2) =4 ζ(2) G\n\nHence, we would need to show that the Epstein zeta function Z(2) =4 ζ(2) G\n\nBut is this true? Let's check. The Epstein zeta function for the quadratic form Q(m,n)=m² + n² is known to relate to certain combinations of zeta functions and Dirichlet L-functions. Specifically, for the sum over m,n≠0 of 1/(m² +n²)^s, which is Z(s).\n\nIn general, these Epstein zeta functions can sometimes be expressed in terms of products of the Riemann zeta function and other Dirichlet series. In this case, since Q(m,n) = m² + n², which is a positive definite binary quadratic form, perhaps there is a relation involving the sum over all representations of integers as sums of two squares.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum Z(s) can be written as ∑_{k=1}^\\infty r_2(k)/k^s, where r_2(k) is the number of representations of k as a sum of two squares of integers. Then, Z(s) = ∑_{k=1}^\\infty r_2(k)/k^s. But r_2(k) is known to be 4 times the sum of the squares' divisors depending on k's prime factorization. However, this might not directly help unless we can relate this to known zeta functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Mellin transforms or other techniques.\n\nBut stepping back, the original problem wants to relate S to ζ(2)G - ζ(4). Given that S = (Z(2) -4 ζ(4))/4, and we need Z(2)=4 ζ(2) G. Therefore, proving that Z(2) =4 ζ(2) G would suffice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express Z(2) as a product involving Catalan's constant. But I need to recall if there's a known relation.\n\nAlternatively, consider evaluating Z(2) directly. Z(2) = ∑_{(m,n)≠(0,0)} 1/(m² +n²)^2. This sum can be split into the terms where m=0 or n=0, but not both, and the rest. So Z(2) = 2 ζ(4) + 2 ζ(4) + S', where S' is the sum over m,n≠0. Wait, no, actually, when m=0, n≠0: sum_n≠0 1/(0 +n²)^2 = 2 sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^4 = 2 ζ(4). Similarly for n=0, m≠0: 2 ζ(4). Then the remaining terms where m,n≠0: sum_{m≠0,n≠0} 1/(m² +n²)^2. But each pair (m,n) where m,n≠0 has four copies in the four quadrants, so this sum is 4 sum_{m,n≥1} 1/(m² +n²)^2 =4S. Hence, Z(2) = 2 ζ(4) + 2 ζ(4) +4S =4 ζ(4) +4S. Therefore, solving for S gives S=(Z(2) -4 ζ(4))/4, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo to compute S, we need Z(2). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps relate Z(2) to an integral involving theta functions. The sum Z(2) can be written using the integral representation as we considered before:\n\nZ(2) = ∑_{(m,n)≠(0,0)} ∫_0^\\infty t e^{-(m² +n²)t} dt = ∫_0^\\infty t (θ_3(0,e^{-t})^2 -1) dt\n\nWhere θ_3 is the Jacobi theta function. But this might not be helpful unless we can evaluate the integral.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in 2D, the sum over m,n of 1/(m² +n²)^s can be related to the product of the Riemann zeta function and a Dirichlet L-function. For example, for s=1, it's known that ∑_{m,n} 1/(m² +n²) diverges, but for s=2, maybe there's a relation.\n\nAlternatively, consider using Fourier analysis on the torus. The function f(x,y) = ∑_{m,n} 1/(m² +n²)^2 e^{i(mx +ny)} could be related to some Green's function, but this might be too complex.\n\nWait, another approach: separate variables using polar coordinates. Express m and n in terms of r and θ, but since m and n are integers, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, use the fact that the sum over m,n can be related to the sum over r of τ(r)/r^2, where τ(r) is the number of ways to write r as m² +n². But τ(r) is similar to r_2(r), which counts the number of representations. Then, Z(2) = sum_{r=1}^\\infty τ(r)/r^2.\n\nBut r_2(r) counts the number of integer solutions to m² +n² =r, so τ(r)=r_2(r). However, this sum would then be Z(2) = ∑_{r=1}^\\infty r_2(r)/r^2. But I don't recall the exact expression for this sum. However, it's known that sums involving r_2(r) can be expressed in terms of Dirichlet L-functions.\n\nSpecifically, r_2(r) is 4 times the sum of the divisors of r congruent to 1 mod 4 minus those congruent to 3 mod 4. Wait, more precisely, for r ≥1, r_2(r) = 4 (d_1(r) - d_3(r)), where d_i(r) is the number of divisors of r congruent to i mod 4. This is a result from number theory regarding sums of squares.\n\nTherefore, Z(2) =4 ∑_{r=1}^\\infty (d_1(r) - d_3(r))/r^2 =4 [∑_{r=1}^\\infty d_1(r)/r^2 - ∑_{r=1}^\\infty d_3(r)/r^2]\n\nEach of these sums can be expressed as a product of zeta functions and Dirichlet L-functions. Specifically, for a character χ, the sum ∑_{r=1}^\\infty d_χ(r)/r^s, where d_χ(r) is the number of divisors of r with χ(d)=1, might decompose into a product.\n\nAlternatively, note that ∑_{r=1}^\\infty d_1(r)/r^s = [ζ(s) L(s, χ)] where χ is the non-principal Dirichlet character modulo 4. Similarly for d_3(r). Because d_1(r) counts the number of divisors congruent to 1 mod 4, so for each divisor d|r, χ_1(d) where χ_1 is the character modulo 4 that is 1 for d≡1 mod4, 0 for even, and -1 for d≡3 mod4. Wait, but this might be getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, recall that ∑_{n=1}^\\infty d_1(n)/n^s = ζ(s) L(s, χ_1), where χ_1 is the Dirichlet character modulo 4 defined by χ_1(d) =1 if d≡1 mod4, -1 if d≡3 mod4, and 0 otherwise. Similarly, ∑_{n=1}^\\infty d_3(n)/n^s = ζ(s) L(s, χ_3), but χ_3 would be similar. However, since d_1(n) and d_3(n) are related through the character.\n\nWait, actually, the standard Dirichlet character modulo 4 is χ defined as χ(n)=1 if n≡1 mod4, χ(n)=-1 if n≡3 mod4, and 0 otherwise. Then, the sum over d_1(n) - d_3(n) would be ∑_{d|n} χ(d). Because for each divisor d of n, if d≡1 mod4, it contributes +1, if d≡3 mod4, it contributes -1, otherwise 0. Hence, ∑_{d|n} χ(d) = d_1(n) - d_3(n).\n\nTherefore, ∑_{n=1}^\\infty (d_1(n) - d_3(n))/n^s = ∑_{n=1}^\\infty (∑_{d|n} χ(d))/n^s = ζ(s) L(s, χ)\n\nBy the convolution of Dirichlet series: if a(n) = ∑_{d|n} b(d) c(n/d), then ∑_{n=1}^\\infty a(n)/n^s = (∑ b(n)/n^s)(∑ c(n)/n^s). In our case, b(d) = χ(d) and c(e) =1, so a(n)=∑_{d|n} χ(d). Therefore, ∑ a(n)/n^s = (∑ χ(d)/d^s)(∑ 1/e^s ) = L(s, χ) ζ(s).\n\nTherefore, Z(2) =4 ζ(2) L(2, χ)\n\nBecause:\n\nZ(2) =4 [∑_{r=1}^\\infty (d_1(r) - d_3(r))/r^2 ]=4 ζ(2) L(2, χ)\n\nBut L(2, χ) is known to be Catalan's constant G. Indeed, the Dirichlet L-series for the character χ modulo4 is:\n\nL(s, χ) = ∑_{n=0}^\\infty χ(n)/n^s = ∑_{k=0}^\\infty [1/(4k+1)^s - 1/(4k+3)^s ]\n\nFor s=2, this becomes G = ∑_{k=0}^\\infty [1/(4k+1)^2 -1/(4k+3)^2 ] = ∑_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n/(2n+1)^2, which is exactly Catalan's constant.\n\nTherefore, L(2, χ)=G.\n\nTherefore, Z(2) =4 ζ(2) G.\n\nThen, going back to the expression for S:\n\nS= (Z(2) -4 ζ(4))/4 = (4 ζ(2) G -4 ζ(4))/4= ζ(2) G - ζ(4)\n\nWhich is exactly the identity we wanted to prove.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Express the original double sum S in terms of the Epstein zeta function Z(2).\n\n2. Relate Z(2) to ζ(2) and the Dirichlet L-function L(2, χ), which is Catalan's constant G.\n\n3. Use the convolution identity for the divisor function weighted by the Dirichlet character.\n\nTherefore, the proof hinges on understanding the Epstein zeta function and its relation to Dirichlet L-functions. This requires knowledge of number theory, specifically the decomposition of sums over quadratic forms into products of zeta and L-functions.\n\nThe user might need to be directed to references on Epstein zeta functions, Dirichlet L-functions, and their relations. Key steps involve expressing the double sum as part of the Epstein zeta function, decomposing it using divisor functions and characters, and recognizing the resulting L-function as Catalan's constant.\n\nSo the formatted problem would capture the essential assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions here are that m and n are positive integers starting from 1, and the problem is to prove the given equality involving the double sum, zeta functions, and Catalan's constant.",
