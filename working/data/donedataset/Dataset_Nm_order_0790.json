    "Content": "$A  \\underset{\\mathbb{C}}{\\sim} B \\overset{\\text{def}}{\\iff} A=C^{-1}BC, \\space C\\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{C})$ and similarly for $\\underset{\\mathbb{R}}{\\sim}$. I want to prove that $ A \\underset{\\mathbb{C}}{\\sim} B$ for $A,B \\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{R})$ therefore $A \\underset{\\mathbb{R}}{\\sim} B$. My idea is that elementary divisors of $A,B$ over $\\mathbb{C}$ are the same, and if $(x-z)^k$ is elementary divisor than $(x-\\overline{z})^k$ is also elementary divisor $\\implies$ $A,B$ have same elementary divisors over $\\mathbb{R}$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $ A \\underset{\\mathbb{C}}{\\sim} B$ , there is a matrix $C \\in GL_n(\\mathbb{C})$ such that $A=C^{-1}BC$ . So $CA=BC$ . $C=P+iQ$ with $P,Q \\in M_n(\\mathbb{R})$ . If $A \\in M_n(\\mathbb{R})$ and $B \\in M_n(\\mathbb{R})$ , we have $CA=BC \\implies (P+iQ)A=B(P+iQ)\\implies PA=BP$ and $QA=BQ$ . The polynomial $\\det (P+XQ)$ is not null, because $\\det(P+iQ)=\\det C \\neq 0$ . So, there is a value $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\det(P+\\lambda Q) \\neq 0$ . Let $D=P+\\lambda Q$ , $DA=BD$ because $PA=BP$ and $QA=BQ$ . So, $A=D^{-1}BD$ and $A \\underset{\\mathbb{R}}{\\sim} B$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Similarity of real matrices over $\\mathbb{C}$\", and the user is asking about proving that if two real matrices are similar over the complex numbers, then they are also similar over the real numbers. They mention the definitions of similarity over $\\mathbb{C}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$, and their idea involves elementary divisors and complex conjugate pairs, but they feel their reasoning isn't clear.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem involves two real matrices, A and B, which are similar over $\\mathbb{C}$. The user wants to prove they are similar over $\\mathbb{R}$. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. A and B are real matrices (i.e., in $M_n(\\mathbb{R})$).\n2. They are similar over $\\mathbb{C}$, meaning there exists a complex invertible matrix C such that $A = C^{-1}BC$.\n\nHowever, the user's approach uses elementary divisors, noting that if $(x - z)^k$ is an elementary divisor, then so is $(x - \\overline{z})^k$, implying the elementary divisors over $\\mathbb{R}$ are the same. But the user is unsure if this is sufficient.\n\nNow, to format this into the given structure. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement is to prove that similarity over $\\mathbb{C}$ implies similarity over $\\mathbb{R}$ for these real matrices.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are that A and B are real matrices and they are similar over $\\mathbb{C}$. So each of these should be separate lines under Assumption.\n\nI should check if there are more implicit assumptions. The problem is about square matrices of size n, but since they mention $M_n(\\mathbb{R})$ and $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$, that's part of the problem setup. However, the user hasn't specified any additional conditions on A and B beyond being real and similar over $\\mathbb{C}$. So the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n$A$ is a real matrix,\n$B$ is a real matrix,\n$A$ and $B$ are similar over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A$ and $B$ are similar over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user defines similarity over $\\mathbb{C}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ but doesn't add any other constraints. The main task is to show that complex similarity implies real similarity for real matrices. The user's approach involves elementary divisors and conjugate pairs, but the problem itself is to prove the implication. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture these assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the example, the assumption about n being divisible by 7 was part of the original problem. But here, in the user's problem, the assumptions are that A and B are real and similar over $\\mathbb{C}$, and the problem is to prove similarity over $\\mathbb{R}$. There's no additional condition like n being even or odd, etc. So the assumptions are straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$A \\in M_n(\\mathbb{R})$,\n$B \\in M_n(\\mathbb{R})$,\n$A \\underset{\\mathbb{C}}{\\sim} B$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A \\underset{\\mathbb{R}}{\\sim} B$.\n\nAlternatively, written out:\n\nAssumption:\n$A$ is a real matrix of size $n \\times n$,\n$B$ is a real matrix of size $n \\times n$,\n$A$ and $B$ are similar over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A$ and $B$ are similar over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nYes, this seems correct. The key points are that A and B are real, they are similar over the complex numbers, and the task is to show they are similar over the reals. The user's approach using elementary divisors and conjugate pairs is their attempt, but the structured problem should not include that; it's part of the solution. The assumptions are only the given conditions.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should be as above.",
