    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume $ \\cos(x) + \\cos(\\sqrt{2} x) = \\cos(x+T) + \\cos(\\sqrt{2} x+ \\sqrt{2} T) $. Let $x=0$. Then $$2=\\cos T + \\cos \\sqrt{2}T$$ Since the cosine is at most one, this means that simultaneously $\\cos T = 1$ and $\\cos \\sqrt{2} T = 1$. This is equivalent to: $$T = 2\\pi n, \\ \\mbox{for some } n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\n$$\\sqrt{2}T = 2\\pi m, \\ \\mbox{for some } m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$ Substitute $T$ from the first into the second: $$\\sqrt{2} (2\\pi n)= 2\\pi m$$\n$$\\sqrt{2}=\\frac{m}{n}$$ So $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ which is a contradiction, or $T=0$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to show that the function f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2) is not periodic. The original problem mentions trying x = a and a√2, and suggests using contradiction. Hmm, I need to structure this according to the given format.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of a periodic function. A function f is periodic if there exists a positive number T such that f(x + T) = f(x) for all x. So the assumption here is that f is periodic, which would mean such a T exists. Then, the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, thereby proving f is not periodic.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for this problem, the main assumption is that f is periodic. But maybe there are more implicit assumptions here. Let's think.\n\nThe function f is composed of two cosine functions with different frequencies: one has frequency 1 (since the coefficient of x is 1), and the other has frequency √2. The key point here is that √2 is irrational. So maybe another assumption is that √2 is irrational. But is that considered part of the problem's assumptions or general mathematical knowledge? Since the problem doesn't state to assume √2 is irrational, but it's a known fact, perhaps we need to include it as an assumption here.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. So in this case, the problem is to show f is not periodic, and the user tried x = a and a√2. The method of contradiction would assume f is periodic, then show this leads to an impossibility.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2) is periodic.\n2. There exists a period T > 0 such that f(x + T) = f(x) for all real numbers x.\n\nBut maybe we need to break down the assumptions more. For instance, the function f is defined as the sum of two cosine functions. Each cosine function individually is periodic, but their sum's periodicity depends on the ratio of their periods being rational. Since √2 is irrational, the sum might not be periodic. However, the problem is to formally prove this.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is one line. Here, for the problem, the key assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) is periodic with period T.\n- T is a positive real number.\n- For all x, cos(x + T) + cos((x + T)√2) = cos(x) + cos(x√2).\n\nBut according to the user's format, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a periodic function,\nThere exists a period T > 0,\nFor all real numbers x, f(x + T) = f(x),\nThe function f is defined as f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n√2 is an irrational number.\n\nWait, but √2 being irrational is a known mathematical fact. Should that be listed as an assumption? The original problem doesn't state to assume that, but in the example, the divisibility by 7 was part of the problem's conditions. So maybe in this case, the problem's assumptions are just the periodicity of f. However, the contradiction arises because √2 is irrational. But do we need to state that √2 is irrational as an assumption here?\n\nAlternatively, the problem's inherent assumptions are:\n\n- The function f is defined as the sum of two cosine functions with arguments x and x√2.\n- f is periodic (to be contradicted).\n\nBut the user's example included specific conditions from the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7; the user's example might have modified the original problem? Wait no, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original. But maybe that was a mistake? Wait, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. But maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because in the original problem, the statement is for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumptions added n divisible by 7, which narrows the problem. So perhaps the example is wrong. But regardless, we need to follow the user's instruction, which says \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format\".\n\nSo in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as:\n\nAssumption: ... (each line one condition)\nProblem: Show that f(x) is not periodic.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed it to assume n is divisible by 7. That seems like the example might be incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a wrong example. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, that changes the problem. That would make the problem only for n divisible by 7. But maybe that's a mistake. However, the user provided that example, so we have to follow the format even if the example is wrong.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem is to show f(x) is not periodic. So the formatted problem's assumption should list the conditions given in the problem. But the problem as stated doesn't have any explicit assumptions except that f is defined as such. However, when proving by contradiction, the assumption is that f is periodic. Therefore, perhaps in the formatted problem, the assumptions should include that f is periodic, leading to the problem of showing a contradiction.\n\nWait, but the example given had the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conclusion. So maybe the user intended to structure the problem by listing the hypotheses or given conditions. In the current problem, the function is defined as f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2). So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) is defined as cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n- √2 is irrational,\n\nBut √2 being irrational is a mathematical fact, not an assumption of the problem. However, since the periodicity depends on the ratio of frequencies being rational, which in this case is 1 and √2, and since √2 is irrational, that's key. But does the problem assume √2 is irrational? Or is that something we need to use?\n\nAlternatively, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- f is periodic (for contradiction),\n- f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the problem's conditions, not the assumption for contradiction. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So the example seems to have a mistake. But since the user provided that example, perhaps in their format, the assumptions include both the problem's given conditions and any necessary properties. For instance, in the original problem, n is an integer (given condition), and n is divisible by 7 (a necessary condition for the divisibility by 91, since 91 = 7*13). So maybe in that example, the user split the problem into assumptions that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the current problem, the function f is defined as cos(x) + cos(x√2). The problem is to show it's not periodic. There are no explicit assumptions given in the problem except the definition of f. However, to use contradiction, we assume f is periodic, leading to certain conditions. But according to the user's format, the assumptions should be the problem's conditions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) is not periodic.\n\nBut the example included an assumption about divisibility by 7, which was part of the problem's conclusion. That suggests maybe the user wants to include all necessary conditions, even those derived for the proof. But that seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to structure the problem with the necessary conditions given in the problem statement. The original problem here is \"Show that the function f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2) is not periodic.\" So the assumptions would just be the definition of f. However, in the example, they added assumptions beyond the problem statement (n is divisible by 7). This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was meant to structure the problem into assumptions and problem statement, where the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the actual question. So in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So maybe the example is incorrect. However, given that the user provided that example, perhaps they expect that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in reality, the problem might have a mistake, and the correct assumptions are that n is divisible by 7. Alternatively, perhaps the example is wrong, but we have to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n- f is periodic,\n\nThen the problem is to show a contradiction. But according to the user's example, the problem part is the actual question. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem's problem part is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the user restructured the problem with more specific assumptions. But in reality, that might be incorrect. However, given the example, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n- f is periodic,\n\nAnd the problem is to show a contradiction (but the original problem is to show f is not periodic). Wait, the example's problem part was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", given the assumptions. So perhaps in our case, the problem part is \"Prove that f(x) is not periodic\", and the assumptions are the properties given in the problem. But the problem as stated only defines f(x). Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) is not periodic.\n\nBut the example included additional assumptions. Maybe the user wants to include known properties as assumptions. But since the example is conflicting, I need to make a judgment. Alternatively, since the problem is to show that f is not periodic, and the method is by contradiction (assuming it is periodic), but the user's example included assumptions from the problem statement, not the contradiction assumption. So perhaps in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the ones given in the problem, and the problem is the question.\n\nIn the original problem here, the user wrote: \"Show that the function f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2) is not periodic.\" So the only assumption is the definition of f. However, the example given by the user added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. Therefore, maybe the user wants to extract the key conditions from the problem. In this case, the key conditions are the function's form and the √2 coefficient.\n\nBut maybe to structure the problem properly, the assumptions should list the components of the function and their properties. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as the sum of cos(x) and cos(x√2),\nThe ratio of the frequencies of the two cosine terms is irrational,\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) is not periodic.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly mention the ratio being irrational. However, since √2 is irrational, that's a key point. So maybe we should include that √2 is irrational as an assumption.\n\nWait, the problem statement does not mention √2's irrationality, but it's a mathematical fact. So perhaps in the formatted problem, we need to list:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n√2 is irrational,\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) is not periodic.\n\nAlternatively, since √2's irrationality is a known fact, maybe it's not listed as an assumption. But in the example, the user included divisibility by 7, which might have been part of the proof's requirement. So perhaps in our case, we need to include the necessary conditions for the proof, such as the irrationality.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's assumptions are only what is given in the problem statement. The problem says \"Show that the function f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2) is not periodic.\" So the only assumption is the definition of f. The rest is part of the proof.\n\nBut given the user's example, which added an assumption not in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps the user wants us to extract implicit assumptions. For instance, in the original example, maybe the problem required n to be divisible by 7, but was stated as \"for every integer n\", but the user incorrectly reformatted it. Or perhaps the example is wrong, but we have to follow it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example is correct in that the original problem had a mistake, and the correct assumption is n divisible by 7. But without knowing, it's hard to tell. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to structure the current problem with the following assumptions:\n\n- f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n- √2 is irrational,\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) is not periodic.\n\nThis captures the key components needed for the proof: the function's definition and the irrationality of √2. However, since √2's irrationality is a known fact, maybe it shouldn't be an assumption. But in the example, divisibility by 7 was included as an assumption even though it wasn't in the original problem. Therefore, to follow the example's pattern, perhaps we include the necessary mathematical facts as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if the example was incorrect, and the assumptions should only include what's given in the problem statement, then the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) is not periodic.\n\nBut then, where does the irrationality come in? It's part of the proof, not the problem's assumptions. So perhaps the correct formatted problem, following the example's style (even if the example is flawed), would list the necessary properties as assumptions. Therefore, including the irrationality of √2 as an assumption because it's crucial to the proof.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are those needed for the contradiction. For example, assuming f is periodic, then derive the contradiction. But in the example, the assumptions were part of the problem's given conditions. Hmm.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Given the example, where the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem assumed n is divisible by 7, it seems that the user wants to extract specific conditions from the problem, possibly those necessary for the proof. So in the current problem, to prove f is not periodic, we need to use that √2 is irrational. Therefore, including √2 is irrational as an assumption.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state that. So perhaps the user's format requires listing all mathematical facts needed as assumptions, even if they are general knowledge. That might be the case.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n√2 is irrational,\nf is periodic.\n\nProblem:\nShow that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is to show f is not periodic, so the problem part should remain \"Show that f(x) is not periodic\". The assumptions would then be the function's definition and properties used. However, according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Since the example included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" for a problem that originally stated \"for every integer n\", perhaps in this case, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = cos(x) + cos(x√2),\nf is periodic,\n\nProblem:\nShow that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut the original problem's question is \"Show that f(x) is not periodic\", so the problem part should remain that, with the assumptions being the definition of f and perhaps other necessary conditions. However, given the example, the formatted problem's problem part is the actual question, and assumptions are the conditions.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll proceed with:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as cos(x) + cos(x√2),\n√2 is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) is not periodic.\n\nThis way, the assumptions include the function's definition and the key property (irrationality) needed for the proof. This follows the example where a mathematical property (divisibility by 7) was included as an assumption even if not stated in the original problem.",
