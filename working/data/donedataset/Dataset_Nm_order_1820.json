    "Content": "Question is to prove that : $S_4$ does not have a normal subgroup of order $8$ I do not have any specific idea how to proceed but: Assuming there exists a normal subgroup $H$ of order $8$ in $S_4$, \nAs $H\\unlhd G$, $HK\\leq G$ for any subgroup $K\\leq G$ and $|HK|=\\frac{|H||K|}{|H\\cap K|}$ what i am trying to do is try getting an element $ x $ of order $2$ which is not in $H$ and set $K=\\{1,x\\}$ then $HK$ would be a group of order $16$ which is a contradiction as $S_4$\n can not have a subgroup of order $16$. as there are six $2-cycles$ and three  products of disjoint $2$ cycles but $|H|=8$, there does exists an element of order $2$ which is not in $H$ and thus we are done. I am sure this would be the nicest way or the stupidest way one can ever do :P I would be thankful if someone can help me to see if anything is wrong in my approach. I would be thankful if someone can give me a hint for an alternate approach. Thank You :)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You approach is OK, but here is a simpler one. Since $S_4/H \\cong C_3$ is abelian, it follows that $[S_4,S_4]=A_4 \\subseteq H$. Can you see this leads to a contradiction?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the symmetric group S₄ doesn't have a normal subgroup of order 8. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that we should assume there's a normal subgroup H of order 8 in S₄. Then, the user mentions using the property that if H is normal, then for any subgroup K, HK is a subgroup of G. The user's approach involves finding an element x of order 2 not in H, setting K as {1, x}, and then showing HK has order 16, which is impossible since S₄'s order is 24, and 16 doesn't divide 24. The user also mentions the existence of such an x because there are more elements of order 2 in S₄ than can fit in H.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n- There exists an element x in S₄ of order 2 not in H.\n- K is a subgroup of S₄ generated by x, so K = {1, x}.\n- The product HK is a subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of HK is calculated as |H||K| / |H ∩ K|.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove S₄ doesn't have a normal subgroup of order 8. But in the formatted version, the problem should be restated with the assumptions. However, looking at the example provided, the assumptions are conditions applied to the problem. The original problem's assumptions here are the existence of such H and the properties used in the approach.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction was about divisibility, and the assumptions listed were the conditions given in the problem. Here, the user's approach is part of their attempt, but the actual problem to structure is the original question. Wait, the task says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove S₄ doesn't have a normal subgroup of order 8. The user's own approach and reasoning in the question might be extraneous. We need to extract the core problem. But the example included some assumptions from the original problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake? Wait, maybe the example was modified. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe example's original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in their example. Wait, the problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted assumptions, they list \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that would mean the problem is only for n divisible by 7, which contradicts the original problem. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here, but maybe the example is illustrative. Maybe the example is not accurate, but the user wants us to follow the format regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem in the example was actually different. Let me recheck. The example's original problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they list assumptions as n is integer, n divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the original problem intended that n must be such that it's divisible by both 7 and 13, but perhaps the user made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the example is wrong, but the task is to follow the format as described, so maybe the user's example is not correct, but we need to proceed as per instructions.\n\nIn any case, the current task is to structure the given problem about S₄ not having a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nOriginal question: Prove that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nThe user's approach is part of their attempt, but the problem itself is as stated. However, in their attempt, they make certain assumptions, like assuming such a subgroup exists and then deriving a contradiction. So, according to the example, perhaps we should list the assumptions made in the problem. But the problem itself is to prove a negative: that no such subgroup exists. So, perhaps the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is set. But in the example, they included assumptions from the problem's statement.\n\nWait, the original example's problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is integer and n divisible by 7, which seems to change the problem. That might be an error in the example. But since the user provided that example, perhaps we need to follow their structure even if it's flawed.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is trying to assume that such a subgroup H exists (normal, order 8) and then derive a contradiction. The problem itself is to prove that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8. So, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include:\n\n- H is a subgroup of S₄.\n\n- The order of H is 8.\n\n- H is normal in S₄.\n\nThen, the problem is to derive a contradiction, hence proving that such H cannot exist. But according to the user's example, perhaps the problem statement is rephrased with the assumptions listed. So the problem would be \"Prove that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8\" with assumptions being H is a normal subgroup of S₄ of order 8, leading to a contradiction.\n\nBut the example seems to have added an extra assumption. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is integer and n divisible by 7, and the problem statement becomes \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". But that would imply that the problem is only for n divisible by 7, which is a subset of integers. However, the original problem is for all integers. So this seems conflicting. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user's intention is that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. If the problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is \"n is an integer\". But in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different wording, but the user presented it inaccurately.\n\nIn any case, focusing back on the S₄ problem: the original problem is to prove S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8. The user's approach is to assume such a subgroup exists and then show a contradiction. Therefore, the core problem is to prove that no such subgroup exists. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- H is a subgroup of S₄.\n\n- The order of H is 8.\n\n- H is normal in S₄.\n\nAnd the problem statement would be to derive a contradiction (i.e., prove that such H cannot exist). But perhaps the problem statement is phrased as \"Prove that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8\", with the assumptions being that H is such a subgroup. But in mathematical proofs by contradiction, you assume the opposite. However, according to the example, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions that are given or needed for the problem. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which translates to the assumption \"n is an integer\". Then, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the example's formatted problem, they added an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Perhaps the user made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem was different, and the user mistyped it. For instance, if the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 7, then the example would make sense. But given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as the conditions given in the problem.\n\nIn the S₄ problem, the problem is to show that no normal subgroup of order 8 exists. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- H is a subgroup of S₄.\n\n- The order of H is 8.\n\n- H is normal in S₄.\n\nBut since the problem is to show that such H does not exist, the problem statement would be to derive a contradiction under these assumptions. However, the standard format for such problems is to state the problem as \"Prove that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8\", and the assumptions are the given conditions. But perhaps according to the user's example, the formatted problem includes the assumptions leading to the problem statement. In the example, the problem became \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was for all integers, so this is conflicting. Therefore, maybe the user's example is flawed, but we need to proceed as per their instructions.\n\nIn the S₄ problem, the user's own approach includes assuming such a subgroup H exists and then finding a contradiction. Therefore, the problem as presented includes the assumption of H's existence. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would include:\n\n- There exists a normal subgroup H of S₄.\n\n- The order of H is 8.\n\n- For any subgroup K of S₄, HK is a subgroup of S₄.\n\n- There exists an element x in S₄ of order 2 not in H.\n\n- K is the subgroup generated by x, so K = {1, x}.\n\n- The order of HK is |H||K| / |H ∩ K|.\n\nBut perhaps not all of these are necessary. The core assumptions from the problem are:\n\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nOther parts are part of the user's approach, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, to structure the problem as per the example, we list the assumptions inherent to the problem. The problem is to prove that S₄ doesn't have a normal subgroup of order 8. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nAnd the problem is to derive a contradiction, hence proving the original statement. However, the example shows that the problem statement is rephrased with the assumptions. So perhaps the problem statement in the formatted version is the same as the original, but the assumptions list the conditions. For example, in the example, the problem became \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions that n is integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was for all integers, which conflicts. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the assumptions to be the hypotheses used in the proof. For the S₄ problem, the user assumes (for contradiction) that H exists. Therefore, the assumption would be \"There exists a normal subgroup H of S₄ with order 8\", and the problem is to derive a contradiction. But in the example, the problem statement is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under the assumptions. So perhaps the formatted problem's \"Problem\" part is the actual statement to prove, and the assumptions are the given conditions. Therefore, in this case, the problem is \"Prove that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8\", with the assumptions being the conditions that lead to the contradiction. But since the problem is to prove the non-existence, perhaps the assumptions are not part of the problem but part of the proof method (contradiction). Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should list the problem as is, with no assumptions, but that conflicts with the example.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Given the example provided by the user, even if it's flawed, I need to follow it. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" and the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". But that changes the original problem's scope. However, following that structure, for the S₄ problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nAnd the problem is to derive a contradiction (i.e., show that this cannot happen). But how to phrase it? The original problem is \"Prove that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8\". So following the example, the formatted problem would list the assumptions (the hypothetical scenario we're assuming for contradiction) and then the problem is to show the contradiction. Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nProblem:\nDerive a contradiction, thereby proving that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nBut the example's problem statement didn't mention deriving a contradiction; it restated the original problem with added assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement remains the same, and the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is to be proven. But the user's example added an extra condition (n divisible by 7) to the assumptions, which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract the key conditions from the problem, even if they are implicit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the assumptions to be the key properties used in solving the problem. For the S₄ problem, the user's approach involves:\n\n- If H is normal, then HK is a subgroup for any K.\n\n- The order formula for HK.\n\n- Existence of an element x of order 2 not in H.\n\nBut those are part of the proof approach, not the problem's assumptions. The problem's core assumptions are just the existence of H as a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a subgroup H cannot exist.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement remains the original one, with assumptions added. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption added n divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to list the necessary conditions for the problem. However, given that, maybe for the S₄ problem, the formatted problem's assumptions are:\n\n- S₄ is the symmetric group on 4 elements.\n\n- A normal subgroup H of S₄ exists.\n\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nAnd the problem is to show a contradiction.\n\nBut I think the key is to list the assumptions inherent to the problem. The problem is to show that S₄ doesn't have a normal subgroup of order 8. Therefore, the assumptions would be the properties of S₄ and group theory relevant to the problem. But according to the example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem's assumptions list \"n is an integer\" and another condition. Therefore, following that, for the S₄ problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- S₄ is the symmetric group on 4 elements.\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nProblem:\nShow that this leads to a contradiction, proving that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement should remain as the original, with assumptions listed as the conditions that are hypothesized. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- There exists a normal subgroup H of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nProblem:\nProve that this leads to a contradiction, hence S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nAlternatively, following the example's structure, where the problem is rephrased with the assumptions:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this changes the original problem. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to proceed as per their instruction. For the current S₄ problem, the user's own approach starts by assuming the existence of H. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a subgroup H cannot exist, i.e., derive a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, if following the example where the problem is kept as the original but assumptions are added, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nProblem:\nProve that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nBut this seems redundant because the assumptions already state that H exists. However, the example did a similar thing: the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, changing the problem's scope. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the formatted problem's assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is to be proven, and the problem statement is the same as the original.\n\nBut given the confusion, the safest approach is to list the assumptions as per the problem's inherent conditions. The problem is to show that no normal subgroup of order 8 exists in S₄. The core assumptions needed for this proof (from the user's approach) are:\n\n1. H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n2. The order of H is 8.\n3. Any element x of order 2 not in H exists.\n4. K is the subgroup generated by x, so K = {1, x}.\n5. HK is a subgroup of S₄.\n6. The order of HK is calculated as |H||K| / |H ∩ K|.\n\nBut some of these are part of the proof steps, not assumptions of the problem. The problem's assumptions are only that H is normal of order 8. The rest are part of the proof methodology.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a subgroup H cannot exist.\n\nOr, more aligned with the example, the problem statement remains as the original, with assumptions being the conditions leading to the contradiction:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nProblem:\nProve that this leads to a contradiction, hence S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nBut the example's problem statement didn't include the contradiction part; it restated the original problem. Given the example's inconsistency, perhaps the user wants the problem statement to remain as is, with the assumptions being the conditions used in the proof. For example, the user's approach assumes H exists and then uses properties to find a contradiction. Therefore, the assumptions are the existence of H and its properties, and the problem is to derive the contradiction.\n\nIn conclusion, after this lengthy reasoning, the correct formatted problem according to the user's example (even if flawed) would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- H is a normal subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n- There exists an element x in S₄ of order 2 not in H.\n- K is the subgroup generated by x (K = {1, x}).\n- HK is a subgroup of S₄.\n- The order of HK is |H||K| / |H ∩ K|.\n\nProblem:\nProve that S₄ does not have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nBut some of these assumptions are part of the proof steps. However, the user's original question includes these steps as part of their approach. The task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The core problem is to prove S₄ has no normal subgroup of order 8. The assumptions necessary are that such a subgroup H exists (for contradiction). Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a normal subgroup H of S₄.\n- The order of H is 8.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a subgroup H cannot exist.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement is kept as the original. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$H$ is a normal subgroup of $S_4$,\nThe order of $H$ is $8$.\nProblem:\nProve that $S_4$ does not have a normal subgroup of order $8$.",
