    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $f(x)=g(x)=e^x$ for $x \\le 0$, while for $x>0$ let $f(x)=1+(1/2)x$ and $g(x)=1+(3/2)x$. Then $h(x)=e^{2x}$ when $x \\le 0$ and for $x>0$ it's $h(x)=1+2x+3x^2/4.$ So in this case neither of $f,g$ are differentiable at $0$, while $h$ is differentiable everywhere. (These functions are each positive and strictly increasing everywhere.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"When differentiability of the product implies differentiability of the individual terms?\" and the question body says:\n\n\"Say we have h(x) = f(x)·g(x) where f and g are continuous and strictly increasing. It follows they are differentiable almost everywhere and so is h. We also know that f > 0 and g > 0. I'm trying to find a straightforward proof that under these conditions, if h is differentiable everywhere then both f and g are also differentiable everywhere. I have more structure on these functions but I was hoping I did need to impose additional assumptions.\"\n\nAlright, so the user wants to prove that if the product h of two continuous, strictly increasing, positive functions f and g is everywhere differentiable, then f and g must also be everywhere differentiable. The assumptions here are about f and g: they are continuous, strictly increasing, positive, and their product h is differentiable everywhere. The problem is to show that under these conditions, f and g are differentiable everywhere.\n\nFirst, I need to extract each assumption line by line, each addressing one property of one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. h(x) is defined as the product of f(x) and g(x).\n2. f is continuous.\n3. f is strictly increasing.\n4. g is continuous.\n5. g is strictly increasing.\n6. f is greater than 0 for all x.\n7. g is greater than 0 for all x.\n8. h is differentiable everywhere.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"f and g are continuous and strictly increasing. It follows they are differentiable almost everywhere and so is h. We also know that f > 0 and g > 0.\" Then the user wants to prove that if h is differentiable everywhere, then f and g are differentiable everywhere.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is assuming f and g are continuous, strictly increasing, positive, and h is differentiable everywhere. The conclusion is that f and g must be differentiable everywhere.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- f is continuous.\n- f is strictly increasing.\n- g is continuous.\n- g is strictly increasing.\n- f > 0 everywhere.\n- g > 0 everywhere.\n- h = f·g is differentiable everywhere.\n\nEach of these is a separate line, each applying to one object (either f, g, or h). So each of these properties is an individual assumption.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f and g are differentiable everywhere under these conditions.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only one property for one object. Let's check:\n\n- h(x) = f(x)·g(x) → this is an assumption about the definition of h. So maybe that should be listed as an assumption.\n\nWait, the problem states \"Say we have h(x) = f(x)·g(x)\" so that's part of the setup, so that's an assumption. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nh is defined as the product of f and g,\nf is continuous,\nf is strictly increasing,\ng is continuous,\ng is strictly increasing,\nf is positive everywhere,\ng is positive everywhere,\nh is differentiable everywhere.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. So that's eight assumptions. Then the problem is to prove that f and g are differentiable everywhere.\n\nLet me check the example given. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original example's formatted problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was modified to include more assumptions? Wait, in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. So perhaps the example is showing a possible way to structure, but maybe in reality, the problem's original conditions are listed as assumptions. Hmm, maybe the example had a mistake, but the user provided it as an example. Anyway, in our current problem, the user's original question has the assumptions as listed: f and g are continuous, strictly increasing, positive, and h is differentiable everywhere. So we need to list all those as separate assumptions.\n\nSo the structured problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nh is defined as h(x) = f(x)·g(x),\nf is continuous,\nf is strictly increasing,\ng is continuous,\ng is strictly increasing,\nf is positive everywhere,\ng is positive everywhere,\nh is differentiable everywhere.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f and g are differentiable everywhere.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user mentions that \"It follows they are differentiable almost everywhere and so is h.\" But in the assumptions, we don't need to include that, because that's a consequence of the given conditions. The user is stating that given f and g are continuous and strictly increasing, hence differentiable almost everywhere, and h is their product, hence also differentiable almost everywhere. But the problem is that if h is actually differentiable everywhere (not just almost), then f and g must also be differentiable everywhere. So the key assumptions are the continuity, strict monotonicity, positivity, and h being everywhere differentiable. So those are the conditions we need to list.\n\nTherefore, each assumption should be:\n\n- h(x) = f(x) * g(x)\n- f is continuous\n- f is strictly increasing\n- g is continuous\n- g is strictly increasing\n- f > 0 everywhere\n- g > 0 everywhere\n- h is differentiable everywhere\n\nSo that's eight assumptions, each on a separate line. Then the problem is to prove that f and g are differentiable everywhere.",
