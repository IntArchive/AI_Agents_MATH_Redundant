    "Content": "Prove that there is no positive integer $n$ such that the following number is prime:\n$$S_n = 1^{2000} + 2^{2000} + \\ldots + n^{2000}$$ I was thinking about the last digit of the number. For certain values of $n$, the last digit of $S$ is even, so $S$ can't be prime. But that's not enough. Can you give me a hint, please? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is not a complete answer, but it does reduce the problem to checking a finite number ($512$, in fact) of cases. [This is no longer a case. I used a computer to check the remaining cases, and it confirmed that $f(n)$ is never prime.] Let\n$$\n  f(n) = 1^{2000} + 2^{2000} + \\dots + n^{2000}.\n$$ It is possible to show that if $p$ is a prime, and $k < p - 1$, then\n$$\n  1^k + 2^k + \\dots + p^k\n$$\nis divisible by $p$. It follows that if $n$ has any prime factors $p$ such that $p > 2001$, then $p | f(n)$, and so $f(n)$ is not prime. (We have that $f(n) \\neq p$ since $f(n) > n^{2000} > n \\geq p$.) (We can break the sum\n$$\n  1^{2000} + 2^{2000} + \\dots + n^{2000}\n$$\nup into $\\frac{n}{p}$ blocks where sum of each block is congruent modulo $p$ to\n$$\n  1^{2000} + 2^{2000} + \\dots + p^{2000} \\equiv 0 \\pmod p\n$$\n) The only cases that remain is when all of the prime factors of $n$ are less than $2000$. Suppose that $p \\mid n$, and let $2000 = (p - 1) q + r$ where $r <  p - 1$. We then have that\n$$\n  1^{2000} + 2^{2000} + \\dots + p^{2000} \\equiv 1^r + 2^r + \\dots + (p - 1)^r \\pmod p\n$$\nAs long as $r \\neq 0$, we have that this is divisible by $p$. Thus $f(n)$ is divisible by $p$. We thus have to consider the case where $p - 1 \\mid 2000$. Thus we can reduce to the case where the only prime factors of $n$ are $2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41, 101, 251, 401$. Now suppose that there is a prime $p$ such that $p^2 \\mid n$. We have that\n$$\n  1^{2000} + 2^{2000} + \\dots + (p^2)^{2000} \\equiv p \\left( 1^{2000} + 2^{2000} + \\dots + p^{2000} \\right) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p.\n$$ As before, this implies that $p \\mid f(n)$. We can thus assume that $n$ is square-free. Thus if $f(n)$ is a prime, then we must have that $n$ is square-free, and its only prime factors are from among $2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41, 101, 251, 401$. This leaves us with a finite number of cases to check. Some of these are easy to rule out. e.g. If $n$ is not divisible by $2$ and has an odd number of factors from among $3, 11, 251$, then we have that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, and in this case we have that $f(n)$ is even. Perhaps similar arguments work for numbers like\n$$\n  f( 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 11 \\times 17 \\times 41 \\times 101 \\times 251 \\times 401)\n$$ I don't think that it would be feasible to check if this number is prime unless there is some small prime which divides it. Edit: In fact, a similar argument to the one above shows that if $n \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$ for any prime $p$ which is not among $2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41, 101, 251, 401$, then $f(n)$ is divisible by $p$. So, in fact\n$$\n  f( 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 11 \\times 17 \\times 41 \\times 101 \\times 251 \\times 401)\n$$\nis not a prime. This is because we also have that\n$$\n  1^{2000} + 2^{2000} + \\dots + (p - 1)^{2000} \\equiv 0 \\pmod p\n$$\nin the cases where $2000 < p - 1$. I've written a python script to check that the only natural numbers $n$ where the above considerations are not sufficient to verify that $f(n)$ is not prime are\n$$\n  1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 11, 33, 17, 255, 374, 101, 8282, 1039391, 13634\n$$ I then checked whether $f(n)$ is prime for these numbers using trial division. It is indeed the case that $f(n)$ is not prime in any of these cases, and so $f(n)$ is never prime.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that there's no positive integer n where the sum S_n = 1²⁰⁰⁰ + 2²⁰⁰⁰ + ... + n²⁰⁰⁰ is prime. The user already thought about the last digit being even sometimes, but that's not sufficient. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different cases for n. Let's start with small n. If n=1, then S_1 = 1²⁰⁰⁰ = 1, which isn't prime. For n=2, S_2 = 1 + 2²⁰⁰⁰. Since 2²⁰⁰⁰ is even, adding 1 makes it odd. But 1 + 2²⁰⁰⁰ could be large, but maybe it's composite. Not sure yet.\n\nBut the user mentioned that sometimes the last digit is even, making S_n even, hence not prime (except when S_n=2). For even n, the sum S_n would be a sum of even numbers (since even exponents on even numbers are even) and 1 (from 1²⁰⁰⁰). Wait, 1 is odd. So if n is even, the sum is (1 + even + even + ...). So total sum would be odd. If n is odd, then there's an odd number of terms. Wait, no, n is the number of terms. For example, n=3: 1 + 2²⁰⁰⁰ + 3²⁰⁰⁰. 2²⁰⁰⁰ is even, 3²⁰⁰⁰ is odd (since any odd number to any power is odd). So 1 (odd) + even + odd = even. Wait, that's even. So if n is odd, the sum would be even. Wait, let's check:\n\nIf n is even: number of terms is even. Each term from 1 to n. The even exponents: 1²⁰⁰⁰ is odd, 2²⁰⁰⁰ even, 3²⁰⁰⁰ odd, ..., n²⁰⁰⁰. If n is even, then there are n/2 even terms and n/2 odd terms. So sum would be (n/2)*(even) + (n/2)*(odd). Wait, but each even term is even, each odd term is odd. So the sum would be (sum of evens) + (sum of odds). The sum of evens is even. The sum of odds: if there are n/2 odd terms, each odd^2000 is odd. Sum of k odd numbers is even if k is even, odd if k is odd. So if n is even, then n/2 odd terms. If n/2 is even, sum of odds is even; if n/2 is odd, sum of odds is odd. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try specific n:\n\nn=2: terms 1 and 2. Sum is 1 (odd) + even = odd. So S_2 is odd.\n\nn=3: terms 1, 2, 3. Sum is 1 (odd) + even + odd = odd + even + odd = even.\n\nn=4: 1 + even + odd + even. Sum: odd + even + odd + even = (odd + odd) + (even + even) = even + even = even.\n\nWait, so for n even:\n\nIf n is even, like n=2: sum is odd.\n\nn=4: sum is even.\n\nHmm, this is inconsistent. Wait, maybe the parity depends on n mod 4 or something. Let's check:\n\nWait, 1²⁰⁰⁰ is always 1 (mod 2), since any odd number to any power is odd. 2²⁰⁰⁰ is even. Similarly, 3²⁰⁰⁰ is odd, etc. So the sum S_n is equal to the number of odd terms plus the sum of even terms. But even terms contribute 0 mod 2, so S_n ≡ number of odd terms mod 2.\n\nNumber of odd terms from 1 to n is ceil(n/2). Wait, no: from 1 to n, the number of odd numbers is floor((n+1)/2). For example, n=2: 1 and 2, one odd. n=3: two odds. n=4: two odds. So number of odd terms is ⌈n/2⌉. Wait, ⌈n/2⌉ is equal to floor((n+1)/2). Anyway, the sum S_n mod 2 is equal to the number of odd terms mod 2. Because each odd term contributes 1, and even terms 0. So sum mod 2 is (number of odd terms) mod 2.\n\nIf the number of odd terms is even, then sum is even. If odd, sum is odd. So when is the number of odd terms even?\n\nNumber of odd terms from 1 to n is:\n\nIf n is even: n/2 odd terms. So if n is even, number of odd terms is n/2. If n/2 is even, then sum is even. If n/2 is odd, sum is odd.\n\nIf n is odd: (n+1)/2 odd terms. So if (n+1)/2 is even, sum even; else odd.\n\nSo for example:\n\nn=1: 1 odd term → sum is 1 mod 2 = 1 (odd).\n\nn=2: 1 odd term → sum is 1 (odd).\n\nn=3: 2 odd terms → sum is 0 (even).\n\nn=4: 2 odd terms → sum even.\n\nn=5: 3 odd terms → sum odd.\n\nn=6: 3 odd terms → sum odd.\n\nn=7: 4 → sum even.\n\nSo depending on n, the sum can be even or odd. When it's even and greater than 2, it's composite. So if S_n is even and ≥2, then it's composite. So for S_n to be prime and even, it must be 2. But S_n = 2 only if n=1 and 1²⁰⁰⁰=1, which isn't 2. So if S_n is even, it's composite. Therefore, we need to consider when S_n is even and when it's odd.\n\nFrom above:\n\nIf n ≡ 0 or 3 mod 4? Wait, maybe better to see:\n\nWhen is the number of odd terms even?\n\nCase 1: n even.\n\nThen number of odd terms = n/2. So n/2 must be even → n divisible by 4.\n\nSo if n ≡0 mod 4, then sum is even.\n\nIf n ≡2 mod 4, then n/2 is odd → sum is odd.\n\nCase 2: n odd.\n\nNumber of odd terms = (n+1)/2. So (n+1)/2 even → n+1 ≡0 mod 4 → n ≡3 mod 4.\n\nThus, sum is even when n ≡0 mod 4 or n ≡3 mod 4.\n\nIn those cases, S_n is even, hence composite (since S_n ≥2). So for n ≡0 or 3 mod4, S_n is even and composite.\n\nBut for other n: n ≡1 or 2 mod4, the sum is odd. So possible primes must come from these n.\n\nBut the problem states there is no positive integer n where S_n is prime. So even if for some n ≡1 or 2 mod4, S_n is odd, we need to show it's composite.\n\nSo perhaps we need another approach. Let's think about modulo 3 or other primes.\n\nSince 2000 is even, each term is a square. Wait, 2000 is 2*1000. So each term is (k^1000)^2. So the sum is sum of squares. Maybe we can find properties of sums of squares modulo primes.\n\nAlternatively, notice that 2000 is divisible by 4 (since 2000 = 4*500). So exponents are multiples of 4. Let's see if we can use modulus 5 or something.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for n ≥2, S_n is divisible by some small prime. For example, if n=2, S_2 =1 + 2^2000. Let's check if this is divisible by 3. 2 mod3=2, 2^2=4≡1 mod3, so 2^2000=(2^2)^1000≡1^1000=1 mod3. So S_2=1+1=2 mod3. So 2 mod3. So if n=2, S_2≡2 mod3. If this is 2, then if S_2 is prime, it could be 2 or primes ≡2 mod3. But 2 is too small. S_2=1 + 2^2000. Since 2^2000 is at least 2, so S_2 is at least 3. If S_2=3, then 2^2000=2, which isn't possible. So S_2 is large, maybe composite.\n\nBut this approach might not be straightforward. Maybe there's a better modulus. Let's think about modulus 5.\n\nAlternatively, consider that when n ≥2, S_n =1 + sum_{k=2}^n k^2000. If n ≥2, then S_n =1 + even number (since each k≥2 is even or odd, but raised to even exponent makes them all even or odd. Wait, 2^2000 is even, 3^2000 is odd, etc. So sum from k=2 to n: sum of even and odd numbers. So sum could be even or odd. For example, if n=2: sum=2^2000, which is even. So S_n=1 + even = odd.\n\nBut this doesn't directly help. Maybe consider modulo 3:\n\nFor k modulo 3, k^2000 cycles every 2 because of Fermat's little theorem. Since 3 is prime, for k not divisible by 3, k^2≡1 mod3, so k^2000=(k^2)^1000≡1^1000=1 mod3. So each term k^2000 ≡1 mod3 if k not divisible by 3, else 0. So sum S_n ≡ number of terms not divisible by 3 mod3. For example, n=2: terms 1 and 2. Both not divisible by3. So S_n≡2 mod3. If n=3: terms 1,2,3. Two not divisible by3, so S_n≡2 mod3. n=4: three terms not divisible by3 (1,2,4), so S_n≡3≡0 mod3. So S_4 is divisible by3. But S_4=1 + 2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000. Since 3^2000 is divisible by3, so S_4=1 +2^2000 +0 +4^2000. Now, 1 +2^2000 +4^2000. Let's compute mod3. 2^2000≡1 mod3, 4≡1 mod3, so 4^2000≡1^2000=1 mod3. So S_4≡1 +1 +1=3≡0 mod3. Therefore, S_4 divisible by3. Hence, if S_4 is ≥3, it's composite. Since S_4 ≥1+16 +... etc., definitely S_4>3. So for n=4, S_n is divisible by3 and composite.\n\nSimilarly, n=5: terms 1,2,3,4,5. Terms not divisible by3: 1,2,4,5 →4 terms. So S_n≡4≡1 mod3. So S_5≡1 mod3. So possible prime? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that for n ≥2, S_n is divisible by some prime depending on n. But this seems vague.\n\nAnother approach: When n is 1, S_1=1, not prime. For n=2, S_2=1+2^2000. Since 2^2000 is even, S_2 is 1 + even = odd. So it could be prime, but we need to show it's not. However, 1+2^2000. If this is a prime, then 2^2000 +1. Known primes of the form 2^{2^k}+1 are Fermat primes, but 2000 is not a power of two. 2000=16*125. So 2^2000 +1=(2^{16})^{125} +1. This can be factored as a sum of odd powers: a^m + b^m when m is odd. But here m=125 is odd, but a=2^{16}, b=1. So 2^{16*125} +1^{125} can be factored as (2^{16} +1)(...). Therefore, 2^{2000} +1 is divisible by 2^{16}+1=65537, which is a prime. Hence, S_2=1+2^2000=2^2000 +1 is divisible by 65537. Since 2^2000 +1 is much larger than 65537, it's composite. Therefore, S_2 is composite.\n\nFor n=3: S_3=1 +2^2000 +3^2000. As previously, modulo3: S_3≡1 +1 +0=2 mod3. But also, since 3^2000 is divisible by3, so S_3=1 +2^2000 + multiple of3. But 2^2000 mod3=1, so S_3=1 +1 +0=2 mod3. So S_3≡2 mod3. If S_3 is prime, it must be 2 or congruent to 2 mod3. But S_3 is 1 + a large even number + a multiple of3, so it's odd. So S_3 is odd and ≥1+16+... which is way larger than2. So possible prime? Let's see if S_3 can be written as a multiple of another number.\n\nAlternatively, note that for odd exponents, but here exponent is even. Maybe consider modulo5. Let's compute 1^2000 mod5=1. 2^2000: φ(5)=4, so 2^4≡1 mod5, so 2^2000=(2^4)^500≡1 mod5. 3^2000: 3^4≡1 mod5, so 3^2000≡1 mod5. So S_3=1 +1 +1=3 mod5. So S_3≡3 mod5. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for n ≥2, S_n can be expressed as a sum that's divisible by some number. For example, if n is even, perhaps group terms in pairs. For example, pair k and (n+1−k). Then k^2000 + (n+1−k)^2000. If n is odd, there's a middle term ((n+1)/2)^2000. But this might not help unless there's symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire sum formula. The sum 1^{2m} + 2^{2m} + ... +n^{2m} can be expressed using Bernoulli numbers, but I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAnother idea: if n ≥2, then S_n =1 + sum_{k=2}^n k^{2000}. If n ≥2, then sum_{k=2}^n k^{2000} is divisible by something. For example, when n=2, sum=2^2000. But we saw that 2^2000 +1 is divisible by 65537. For n=3, sum=2^2000 +3^2000. Maybe factorable?\n\nAlternatively, consider that for even exponents, the sum can be expressed as a multiple of (1 + 2^2000 + ... +n^2000). Wait, but I don't see a direct factorization.\n\nWait, but for the problem, we need to show that for any positive integer n, S_n is composite. The user mentioned that for some n, S_n is even, hence composite. But for others, like n=1 (which gives S_1=1, not prime), n=2 (composite), n=3 (needs to check if it's composite), etc.\n\nSo maybe split into cases:\n\nCase 1: n is even. Then S_n is either odd or even depending on n mod4. Wait earlier analysis showed that when n is even, S_n is even if n≡0 mod4, else odd. Hmm, not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think of n=1: not prime. n=2: composite. n=3: composite. n=4: composite. Etc. So maybe for all n, S_n is either 1 (not prime) or even (hence composite) or odd but divisible by a smaller prime.\n\nAlternatively, consider that when n ≥2, the sum S_n is at least 1 + 2^2000. Which is a very large number. For such numbers to be prime, they must pass certain primality tests. But the problem states that there is no such n, implying that for all n, S_n is composite. So maybe there's a general factorization or a common divisor.\n\nWait, let's think about specific values:\n\nTake n=2: S=1+2^2000. As mentioned, divisible by 65537.\n\nn=3: S=1+2^2000 +3^2000. Let's check if this is divisible by 5. As before, modulo5: 1+1+1=3≠0. Not divisible by5. Modulo7: compute each term.\n\n1^2000 mod7=1.\n\n2^2000: φ(7)=6, 2000=6*333 + 2. So 2^2000≡2^2=4 mod7.\n\n3^2000: φ(7)=6, 3^6≡1 mod7, so 3^2000=3^(6*333 + 2)= (3^6)^333 *3^2≡1^333*2=2 mod7.\n\nSo S_3 mod7=1+4+2=7≡0 mod7. Therefore, S_3 is divisible by7. Since S_3>7, it's composite.\n\nAh! So for n=3, S_n is divisible by7. Similarly, maybe for other n, we can find divisors.\n\nLet's check n=5. S_5=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 +5^2000.\n\nCompute modulo7:\n\n1^2000=1.\n\n2^2000≡4 mod7.\n\n3^2000≡2 mod7.\n\n4^2000=(2^2)^2000=2^4000. φ(7)=6, so 4000=6*666 +4. 2^4=16≡2 mod7. So 4^2000≡2 mod7.\n\n5^2000. 5≡5 mod7, φ(7)=6. 2000=6*333 +2. 5^2000≡5^2=25≡4 mod7.\n\nSo sum:1+4+2+2+4=13≡6 mod7. Not divisible by7.\n\nCheck modulo5: S_5=1 +0 + (3^2000) + (4^2000) +0. Since 2^2000 and 5^2000 are 0 mod5. 3^2000: φ(5)=4, 3^2000= (3^4)^500≡1 mod5. 4^2000=(4^4)^500≡(256)^500≡1 mod5. So S_5=1+0+1+1+0=3 mod5. Not divisible by5.\n\nCheck modulo11: Maybe this is getting too involved. Alternatively, notice a pattern.\n\nFor n=1: S=1 (not prime).\n\nn=2: divisible by65537.\n\nn=3: divisible by7.\n\nn=4: divisible by3.\n\nn=5: ?\n\nWait, let's check n=4. S_4=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000. As before, modulo3:\n\n1 +1 +0 +1=3≡0 mod3. So divisible by3.\n\nSimilarly, n=5: need to find a divisor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any n, S_n is divisible by something. For example, when n≥2, S_n is divisible by a prime depending on n.\n\nAlternatively, note that for even exponents, the sum can be divided into pairs. For example, if n is even, pair k and (n+1−k). Then k^2000 + (n+1−k)^2000. If n+1 is odd, then n is even, so pairs are (1,n), (2,n-1), etc. Each pair is k^2000 + (n+1−k)^2000. But how does this help? If n+1 is a certain number, maybe modulus.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 2000 is a multiple of 4. So each term k^2000 is a square. Wait, 2000=4*500, so k^2000=(k^500)^4. Fourth powers. Sum of fourth powers. Maybe use properties of fourth powers modulo primes.\n\nFor example, modulo5, fourth powers:\n\n0^4=0, 1^4=1, 2^4=16≡1, 3^4=81≡1, 4^4=256≡1 mod5. So any fourth power is 0 or1 mod5. So sum of fourth powers mod5 would be count of numbers not divisible by5 mod5.\n\nSimilarly, for exponent 2000, which is divisible by4, so k^2000≡0 or1 mod5. Thus, S_n ≡ number of terms not divisible by5 mod5.\n\nBut this might not directly help. However, if we can find a modulus where S_n is divisible by a prime for all n.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the sum S_n can be expressed via Faulhaber's formula, which might have a factor.\n\nAlternatively, think about the case when n is even and when n is odd.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's recall that the user mentioned that for certain n, the sum is even. But we need to cover all n.\n\nFrom earlier analysis:\n\nWhen n ≡0 or3 mod4, S_n is even, hence composite (since S_n≥3).\n\nFor n≡1 or2 mod4, S_n is odd. We need to show that in these cases, S_n is also composite.\n\nFor example:\n\nn=1: S=1 (not prime).\n\nn=2: S=1+2^2000. As discussed, divisible by65537, composite.\n\nn=3: divisible by7.\n\nn=5: need to check.\n\nn=5: compute S_5 modulo7:\n\n1^2000=1.\n\n2^2000: φ(7)=6, 2000=6*333 +2→2^2=4 mod7.\n\n3^2000: φ(7)=6, 3^2=2 mod7.\n\n4^2000: (2^2)^2000=2^4000. 4000 mod6=4→2^4=16≡2 mod7.\n\n5^2000:5^2000≡(5^6)^333 *5^2≡1^333 *4=4 mod7.\n\nSo sum:1+4+2+2+4=13≡6 mod7. Not divisible by7.\n\nCheck modulo11:\n\nphi(11)=10, so 2000 mod10=0. So exponents mod10:\n\nk^2000 mod11.\n\nFor k not divisible by11, k^10≡1 mod11, so k^2000=(k^10)^200≡1^200=1 mod11.\n\nSo sum S_n ≡ number of terms not divisible by11 mod11.\n\nFor n=5: all terms not divisible by11. So sum=5 mod11. Not divisible by11.\n\nCheck modulo5:\n\nAs before, each term not divisible by5 is 1 mod5. So S_5=1 +0 +1 +1 +0=3 mod5. Not divisible by5.\n\nCheck modulo 7 again. Not helpful. Maybe try modulo13.\n\nphi(13)=12. 2000=12*166 +8. So k^2000≡k^8 mod13.\n\nCompute each term for n=5:\n\n1^8=1 mod13.\n\n2^8=256 mod13. 256/13=19*13=247, 256-247=9→2^8≡9 mod13.\n\n3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2≡3^2=9 mod13.\n\nWait, 3^4=81≡3 mod13 (81-6*13=81-78=3). Then 3^8=(3^4)^2≡3^2=9 mod13.\n\n4^8=(4^4)^2=256^2≡ (256 mod13=9)^2=81≡3 mod13.\n\n5^8=(5^4)^2=(625)^2. 625 mod13: 13*48=624, so 625≡1 mod13. So 5^4≡1, so 5^8≡1 mod13.\n\nSum S_5 mod13:1+9+9+3+1=23≡10 mod13. Not divisible by13.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider n=5: S_5=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 +5^2000. Let's see if this can be factored.\n\nAlternatively, notice that for n ≥2, S_n =1 + sum_{k=2}^n k^2000. If n is even, perhaps group terms as k and n+1−k. For example, if n=4, pair 1 and4, 2 and3. Then each pair k^2000 + (5−k)^2000. For example, 1^2000 +4^2000 and 2^2000 +3^2000. Maybe these sums have common factors.\n\nBut for general n, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, consider that when n is even, the sum can be split into pairs that are multiples of (k + (n+1−k)), but since the exponent is even, it's not straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: since 2000 is divisible by4, each term is a fourth power. Sum of fourth powers. Maybe use the identity that sum of two fourth powers can be factored if exponent is even. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for n≥2, the sum S_n is greater than any of its terms, but that's trivial.\n\nWait, let's think back to the original problem. The user wants to show there's no n such that S_n is prime. We have covered cases where S_n is even, hence composite (except n=1). For n=1, S=1 not prime. For n=2, S=1+2^2000 divisible by65537. For n=3, divisible by7. For n=4, divisible by3. For n=5, need to check.\n\nBut perhaps there's a general approach: For any n ≥1, S_n is either 1 or composite. To show that, maybe consider that for n ≥2, S_n can be written as a product of two numbers >1. Or, for n ≥2, there exists a prime p that divides S_n, where p ≤n.\n\nWait, consider that for n ≥2, the sum S_n includes the term 1 and other terms. If n ≥2, then 2^2000 is in the sum. But how does that help?\n\nWait, let's consider that if n ≥2, then S_n =1 +2^2000 +…+n^2000. Suppose there exists a prime p that divides all terms except 1. Then p would divide S_n -1, but p doesn't divide 1, so p doesn't divide S_n. But this is the opposite of what we need.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a prime p such that p divides S_n and p ≤n. For example, if n ≥7, then by using the fact that k^{p-1}≡1 mod p for k not divisible by p (Fermat's little theorem). But since 2000 is a multiple of p-1 for some p?\n\nAlternatively, consider primes p where p-1 divides 2000. For example, p=3: p-1=2 divides 2000. So for any k not divisible by3, k^2000≡1 mod3. Therefore, S_n ≡ number of terms not divisible by3 mod3. For example, if n ≥3, then the sum includes 1,2,3^2000, etc. But this depends on n.\n\nWait, let's take p=3. For any k not divisible by3, k^2000≡1 mod3. So sum S_n ≡ count of numbers from1 to n not divisible by3 mod3. If n=3: two numbers not divisible by3 (1,2), so S_n≡2 mod3. Not divisible by3. But for n=4: three numbers not divisible by3 (1,2,4), so S_n≡0 mod3. Hence divisible by3. So for n=4, S_n divisible by3. Similarly, n=7: numbers not divisible by3 up to7 are1,2,4,5,7: five numbers, so S_7≡5 mod3=2. Not divisible by3. So this approach only sometimes works.\n\nSimilarly, take p=5. p-1=4 divides 2000. So for k not divisible by5, k^2000≡1 mod5. So sum S_n ≡ count of numbers from1 to n not divisible by5 mod5. For example, n=5: four numbers not divisible by5 (1,2,3,4), so S_5≡4 mod5. Not divisible by5. But n=6: five numbers not divisible by5 (1,2,3,4,6), so S_6≡0 mod5. Hence divisible by5. So for n=6, S_n divisible by5.\n\nSo for primes p where p-1 divides 2000, and for n sufficiently large such that the count of numbers not divisible by p in 1 to n is divisible by p, then S_n is divisible by p. But this requires specific n.\n\nBut how to ensure that for every n, there exists some p (depending on n) such that p divides S_n. For example:\n\nIf n ≡0 mod3, then S_n divisible by3.\n\nIf n ≡4 mod5, then S_n divisible by5.\n\nBut this doesn't cover all n.\n\nHowever, combining multiple primes:\n\nFor example, if n ≥2, then:\n\n- If n is even:\n\n   - If n ≡0 mod4, S_n even.\n\n   - If n ≡2 mod4, check other primes.\n\n- If n is odd:\n\n   - If n ≡3 mod4, S_n even.\n\n   - If n ≡1 mod4, need another prime.\n\nBut this still leaves some cases.\n\nAnother angle: For n=1, S=1 not prime. For n≥2:\n\nIf n is even:\n\n   - If n=2, S divisible by65537.\n\n   - If n≥4 and even:\n\n       - If n≡0 mod4, S even.\n\n       - If n≡2 mod4, then maybe check modulo other primes.\n\nIf n is odd:\n\n   - If n=1, already handled.\n\n   - If n≥3 and odd:\n\n       - If n≡3 mod4, S even.\n\n       - If n≡1 mod4, need to find a divisor.\n\nBut this seems too fragmented. Perhaps a better approach is needed.\n\nLet me consider that the exponent 2000 is a multiple of 100. So each term is a 100th power. Maybe use the fact that the sum of powers can be factored.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for a^n + b^n, if n is even, it can be factored if a and b are specific. But sum of multiple terms doesn't directly factor.\n\nWait, but the sum can be written as 1 + sum_{k=2}^n k^2000. For n=2, sum=2^2000. For n=3, sum=2^2000 +3^2000, etc.\n\nBut maybe use the fact that for even exponents, the terms can be written as squares, and sum of squares have properties. But the sum of squares can be prime, e.g., 1^2 +2^2=5, which is prime. However, in this problem, the exponent is much higher.\n\nAnother idea: For n ≥2, S_n is divisible by 1 + something. For example, S_n =1 + (even number). So S_n is odd. But this isn't necessarily helpful unless we can show it's divisible by something else.\n\nWait, n=5: S_5=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 +5^2000. Let's check modulo7 again:\n\nAs before, S_5≡6 mod7. Not helpful. Check modulo13:\n\nAs before, S_5≡10 mod13. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum is divisible by n itself or n+1. For example, check if S_n is divisible by n+1.\n\nTake n=2: S=1 +2^2000. Is this divisible by3 (n+1=3)? 2≡-1 mod3, so 2^2000=(-1)^2000=1 mod3. So S=1+1=2 mod3. Not divisible by3. So n=2 not divisible by3.\n\nn=3: S=1 +2^2000 +3^2000. Is this divisible by4 (n+1=4)? 1 mod4=1, 2^2000=0 mod4 (since 2^2=0 mod4), 3^2000= (3^2)^1000=9^1000≡1^1000=1 mod4. So S=1+0+1=2 mod4. Not divisible by4.\n\nn=4: S=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000. n+1=5. Check modulo5: 1 +0 +0 + (4^2000). 4^2000=(4^4)^500=256^500≡1^500=1 mod5. So S=1+0+0+1=2 mod5. Not divisible by5.\n\nSo S_n not generally divisible byn+1.\n\nAnother approach inspired by the user's hint: the user thought about the last digit. Let's explore that.\n\nFor the last digit of S_n, which is the sum of k^2000 mod10.\n\nSince 2000 is a multiple of4, and the last digit of k^2000 depends on k's last digit.\n\nFor any k, k^2000 mod10:\n\n0^2000=0.\n\n1^2000=1.\n\n2^2000: 2^4=16≡6 mod10, so 2^(4*500)=6^500. 6^n≡6 mod10.\n\n3^2000: 3^4=81≡1 mod10, so 3^(4*500)=1^500=1 mod10.\n\n4^2000: 4^4=256≡6 mod10, 4^2000=(4^4)^500≡6^500≡6 mod10.\n\n5^2000=5.\n\n6^2000=6.\n\n7^2000:7^4=2401≡1 mod10, so 7^2000≡1.\n\n8^2000:8^4=4096≡6 mod10, so8^2000≡6.\n\n9^2000:9^4=6561≡1 mod10, so9^2000≡1.\n\nSo the last digits of k^2000 are as follows:\n\nk ending with 0: 0.\n\n1:1.\n\n2:6.\n\n3:1.\n\n4:6.\n\n5:5.\n\n6:6.\n\n7:1.\n\n8:6.\n\n9:1.\n\nSo the sum S_n's last digit is the sum of these digits for k=1 to n, mod10.\n\nLet's compute S_n mod10 for various n:\n\nFor example:\n\nn=1: 1 →1.\n\nn=2:1+6=7.\n\nn=3:1+6+1=8.\n\nn=4:1+6+1+6=14→4.\n\nn=5:14+5=19→9.\n\nn=6:19+6=25→5.\n\nn=7:25+1=26→6.\n\nn=8:26+6=32→2.\n\nn=9:32+1=33→3.\n\nn=10:33+0=33→3.\n\nn=11:33+1=34→4.\n\nn=12:34+6=40→0.\n\nn=13:40+1=41→1.\n\nn=14:41+6=47→7.\n\nn=15:47+5=52→2.\n\nn=16:52+6=58→8.\n\nn=17:58+1=59→9.\n\nn=18:59+6=65→5.\n\nn=19:65+1=66→6.\n\nn=20:66+0=66→6.\n\nAnd so on. So the last digits cycle every 20 terms? Not sure, but important point: the last digit of S_n can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. If the last digit is even (0,2,4,6,8), then S_n is even, hence composite (if S_n≥2). If the last digit is 5, then S_n is divisible by5, hence composite (if S_n≥5). Only when the last digit is 1,3,7,9 could S_n potentially be prime. But even in those cases, S_n might be composite.\n\nFrom the examples above:\n\nn=1: last digit1, S=1 not prime.\n\nn=2: last digit7, S=1+2^2000. We saw it's composite.\n\nn=3: last digit8, which is even. So S_3 even. Wait, but earlier calculation said S_3 mod10=8. But earlier analysis said if n=3, which is odd, S_n is even. So yes, for n=3, S_n is even, hence composite.\n\nWait, but according to the last digit analysis, n=3 gives sum mod10=8, which is even. So S_3 is even. So regardless of n, if the sum's last digit is even or 5, S_n is composite. Only when last digit is1,3,7,9 could it be prime. But in reality, for n=3, the sum is even, so no.\n\nWait, but in the earlier parity analysis, for n=3 (odd), S_n is even. So regardless of the last digit, S_n is even. Wait, there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, let's check for n=3. S_3=1 +2^2000 +3^2000. Since 2^2000 is even, 3^2000 is odd. So sum is 1 (odd) + even + odd = even. So S_3 is even. But according to last digit analysis, sum mod10=8, which is even. So S_3 is even, hence composite (since S_3>2). Similarly, n=5: sum's last digit is9, which is odd, but sum S_5=1 + even + odd + even + odd=1 + even + even + odd=even? Wait, no. Let's compute parity again.\n\nWait, for any k, k^2000 is even if k is even, odd if k is odd. So sum S_n is sum_{k=1}^n k^2000. The number of odd terms is the number of odd k from1 to n. Each odd k contributes 1 to the sum's parity, even k contribute0. So S_n mod2 = number of odd k's mod2.\n\nNumber of odd k's from1 to n is:\n\nIf n is even: n/2 terms. So if n/2 is even, sum even; else odd.\n\nIf n is odd: (n+1)/2 terms. So if (n+1)/2 even, sum even; else odd.\n\nSo:\n\nIf n ≡0 mod4: even terms (n/2 even), sum even.\n\nIf n≡2 mod4: n/2 odd, sum odd.\n\nIf n≡1 mod4: (n+1)/2= (1+1)/2=1→odd, sum odd.\n\nIf n≡3 mod4: (n+1)/2= (4)/2=2→even, sum even.\n\nThus:\n\nSum S_n is even if n≡0 or3 mod4.\n\nSum S_n is odd if n≡1 or2 mod4.\n\nBut according to the last digit analysis, for example:\n\nn=5 (n≡1 mod4), sum is odd. Last digit9, which is odd.\n\nn=2 (n≡2 mod4), sum is odd. Last digit7, which is odd.\n\nSo parity and last digit are consistent. But the key point is that for n≡0 or3 mod4, sum is even and hence composite (since sum ≥3). For n≡1 or2 mod4, sum is odd. However, we need to show that even in these cases, sum is composite.\n\nFor example:\n\nn=5: sum is odd, last digit9. Need to show it's composite.\n\nn=2: sum is odd, last digit7, but we saw it's divisible by65537.\n\nn=1: sum=1, not prime.\n\nn=5: let's check S_5=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 +5^2000. Let's compute modulo3:\n\n1 + (2^2000 mod3=1) + (3^2000 mod3=0) + (4^2000 mod3=1) + (5^2000 mod3= (2^2000)=1). So total=1+1+0+1+1=4≡1 mod3. Not divisible by3.\n\nModulo5: S_5=1 +0 + (3^2000) + (4^2000) +0. 3^2000≡0 mod5? No, 3^4≡1 mod5, so 3^2000=(3^4)^500≡1 mod5. Similarly,4^2000=(4^4)^500≡1 mod5. So sum=1+0+1+1+0=3 mod5. Not divisible by5.\n\nModulo7: S_5≡6 mod7. Not divisible.\n\nModulo11: phi(11)=10, 2000=10*200. So k^2000 mod11=1 if k not divisible by11. So S_5=1 +1 +1 +1 +1=5 mod11. Not divisible by11.\n\nModulo13: S_5≡10 mod13. Not divisible.\n\nHmm. Maybe try modulo101. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think that for n≡1 mod4, maybe S_n is divisible by a specific prime.\n\nAlternatively, notice that 2000= 16*125. So k^2000= (k^16)^125. So sum S_n= sum_{k=1}^n (k^16)^125. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAnother idea inspired by n=2 and n=3: For n=2, S_n=1+2^2000. If we write this as 2^2000 +1, which is a generalized Fermat number. These numbers are known to have factors. Similarly, for n=3, S_n=1+2^2000 +3^2000. Maybe this sum can be written as a multiple of a smaller prime.\n\nBut how to generalize for all n?\n\nWait, going back to the problem: the user wants to prove that there is no positive integer n such that S_n is prime. We've covered that for n=1, S=1 (not prime). For n=2, S=1+2^2000, which is composite. For n=3, S divisible by7. For n=4, divisible by3. For n=5, need to find a divisor.\n\nAlternatively, for n≥2, if we can show that S_n >p and S_n divisible byp for some prime p, then S_n is composite. To find such p, maybe consider primes p where p divides S_n for all n≥p. For example, by using the fact that k^{p-1}≡1 modp for k not divisible byp. Since 2000 is a multiple of (p-1), then k^2000≡1 modp for k not divisible byp. So S_n≡ number of terms not divisible byp modp. If n≥p, then there are at least p terms. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, choose p=7. Then for k not divisible by7, k^6≡1 mod7. Since 2000=6*333 +2, so k^2000=(k^6)^333 *k^2≡1^333 *k^2 mod7. So S_n= sum_{k=1}^n k^2000 ≡ sum_{k=1}^n k^2 mod7. Unless k is divisible by7.\n\nSo for example, if n=7, sum S_7= sum_{k=1}^7 k^2000. For k=7, term=0 mod7. For others, k^2000≡k^2 mod7. So S_7≡ sum_{k=1}^6 k^2 mod7. Compute sum of squares from1 to6:\n\n1+4+9+16+25+36=1+4+9+16+25+36=91≡0 mod7. Hence S_7≡0 mod7. Therefore, divisible by7. So S_7 is composite.\n\nSimilarly, for n=7+7m, S_n divisible by7. But need to cover all n.\n\nBut this approach works for specific primes. For example, for p=7, if n≥7, then S_n divisible by7. But not for smaller n. For example, n=3: S_3 divisible by7, as shown earlier.\n\nWait, n=3: k=1,2,3. For k=1:1^2000≡1 mod7. k=2:2^2000≡4 mod7. k=3:3^2000≡2 mod7. Sum=1+4+2=7≡0 mod7. So divisible by7. So for n=3, divisible by7. For n=7, as shown, divisible by7. For n=10: sum from1 to10. For k=1-10:\n\nTerms divisible by7:7. Others: k^2000≡k^2 mod7.\n\nSum_{k=1}^10 k^2000 ≡ sum_{k=1}^10 k^2 mod7, except k=7 which is0.\n\nSum k^2 from1 to6 and8 to10:\n\n1+4+9+16+25+36+64+81+100.\n\nConvert to mod7:\n\n1+4+2+2+4+1+1+4+2= (1+4)+(2+2)+(4+1)+(1+4)+2=5+4+5+5+2=21≡0 mod7. So S_10≡0 mod7. Hence divisible by7.\n\nSo it seems that for any n≥3, S_n is divisible by7 if n≡3,7,10,... mod7? Not sure. But the key is that for n≥3, S_n is divisible by7. Wait, no:\n\nTake n=4:\n\nsum k=1-4. 1^2000 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 mod7:\n\n1 +4 +2 + (4^2000). 4^2000= (2^2)^2000=2^4000. 4000 mod6=4 (since phi(7)=6). So 2^4=16≡2 mod7. So 4^2000≡2 mod7. Sum=1+4+2+2=9≡2 mod7. Not divisible by7. So n=4 not divisible by7.\n\nBut earlier n=3,7,10 are divisible by7. So not all n≥3.\n\nBut the point is, for certain n, S_n is divisible by7, hence composite. For others, need to check other primes.\n\nBut how to ensure that for every n≥1, there exists some prime p that divides S_n, making it composite.\n\nGiven the problem states that no such n exists, the answer must involve showing that for all n≥1, S_n is either 1 or composite.\n\nThe key insight might be that for n≥2, S_n can be expressed as a sum that's divisible by a prime p, where p divides S_n and p ≤n or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, note that for n≥2, the sum S_n is divisible by 1 and itself, but that's trivial. Need to find another divisor.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if n is even, S_n is either even (divisible by2) or odd. If odd, need to find another divisor. But how?\n\nBut this is taking too long. Let's recap the problem:\n\nProve there's no positive integer n such that S_n is prime. We have to show for all n, S_n is composite.\n\nFrom the cases:\n\nn=1: S=1 (not prime).\n\nn=2: S=1+2^2000, which is divisible by65537 (a prime), hence composite.\n\nn=3: divisible by7.\n\nn=4: divisible by3.\n\nn=5: Let's try modulo11:\n\nphi(11)=10. 2000=10*200. So for k not divisible by11, k^2000≡1 mod11. So S_5=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 +5^2000. 2,3,4,5 not divisible by11. So sum=1 +1+1+1+1=5 mod11. Not divisible by11. Not helpful.\n\nCheck modulo7:\n\nAs before, S_5≡6 mod7. Not divisible.\n\nCheck modulo 7:\n\nS_5=1 +4 +2 +2 +4=13≡6 mod7. Not divisible.\n\nCheck modulo 17:\n\nphi(17)=16. 2000=16*125. So k^2000≡1 mod17 for k not divisible by17. So S_5=1 +1 +1 +1 +1=5 mod17. Not divisible.\n\nCheck modulo 13:\n\nAs before, S_5≡10 mod13.\n\nHmm. Maybe n=5 is prime. But the problem states that no n exists, so there must be a divisor.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that 5^2000 is divisible by5, so S_5=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 +5^2000. The term5^2000 is divisible by5. So S_5=5^2000 + (1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000). Let's compute this part mod5:\n\n1 mod5=1. 2^2000 mod5= (2^4)^500=16^500≡1^500=1 mod5. 3^2000≡(3^4)^500=81^500≡1 mod5. 4^2000=(4^4)^500=256^500≡1 mod5. So sum=1+1+1+1=4 mod5. Thus, S_5=5^2000 +4 mod5=0 +4=4 mod5. So S_5≡4 mod5. Not divisible by5. So not helpful.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, consider that for any n≥2, the sum S_n =1 +2^2000 +…+n^2000. For n≥2, the sum is at least1 +2^2000. Since2^2000 is even, S_n is odd. So S_n is odd and greater than2, hence possible prime. But the problem states no such n exists. So there must be another divisor.\n\nBut if n=2, S_n=1 +2^2000, which is divisible by65537. For n=3, divisible by7. For n=4, divisible by3. For n=5, need to find a divisor.\n\nWait, let's check n=5 modulo7 again. S_5=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 +5^2000.\n\nEarlier calculation:\n\n2^2000 mod7=4.\n\n3^2000 mod7=2.\n\n4^2000 mod7=2.\n\n5^2000 mod7=4.\n\nSo sum=1 +4 +2 +2 +4=13≡6 mod7. Not divisible.\n\nCheck modulo 17:\n\nphi(17)=16, 2000=16*125. So for k not divisible by17, k^2000≡1 mod17. For n=5, all terms not divisible by17. So sum=5 mod17. Not divisible.\n\nCheck modulo 5:\n\nAs before, sum=3 mod5.\n\nCheck modulo 3:\n\n sum=1 +1 +0 +1 +1=4≡1 mod3. Not divisible.\n\nCheck modulo 7:\n\nAlready done.\n\nCheck modulo 11:\n\n sum=5 mod11.\n\nCheck modulo 13:\n\n sum=10 mod13.\n\nCheck modulo 19:\n\nphi(19)=18. 2000=18*111 +2. So k^2000≡k^2 mod19 for k not divisible by19.\n\nSo S_5=1 +2^2 +3^2 +4^2 +5^2=1+4+9+16+25=55≡55-2*19=55-38=17 mod19. Not divisible.\n\nCheck modulo 7:\n\nNo luck.\n\nMaybe try modulo 73. 73 is a prime, and 73-1=72 divides2000? 2000/72≈27.77, so no.\n\nAlternatively, try modulo 7.\n\nAlternatively, consider that S_5=1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 +5^2000. Let's see if this can be written as a multiple of something.\n\nNote that 1 +5^2000 =5^2000 +1. Which is similar to n=2 case, divisible by a Fermat prime. But 5^2000 +1 can be factored as (5^1000)^2 +1, which might have factors.\n\nSimilarly, 2^2000 +4^2000=2^2000 + (2^2)^2000=2^2000 +2^4000=2^2000(1 +2^2000). This is composite.\n\nBut this leaves 1 +2^2000 +3^2000 +4^2000 +5^2000= (1 +5^2000) + (2^2000 +4^2000) +3^2000. Each grouped t",
