    "Content": "The five lemma is an extremely useful result in algebraic topology and homological algebra (and maybe elsewhere). The proof is not hard - it is essentially a diagram chase. Exercise 1.1 in McCleary's \"Users Guide to Spectral Sequences\" has the problem of proving the five-lemma using a spectral sequence. Now I know this can be done using a spectral sequence of a double complex, but this is not yet introduced yet. In fact we don't really know too much about spectral sequences after Chapter 1. We know about filtration on a graded space, what a spectral sequence is, and how to set it up. We have showed that is collapses at certain pages under some appropriate conditions. There is a large section about bigraded algebras/spectral sequences and we know about reconstucting $H^*$ from knownledge of $E^{\\ast,\\ast}_\\infty$ But it doesn't immediately strick me how to use just this knowledge to prove the five lemma. Maybe McClearly is just presuming his readers are smart enough to figure out to construct a total complex (i.e. summing along the diagonal)? Or am I missing something obvious?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider a commutative diagram r      r'\n0 <--- M' <--- M <--- M'' <--- 0\n       |       |      |\n       | f'    | f    | f''\n       V       V      V\n0 <--- N' <--- N <--- N'' <--- 0\n            k      k' with exact rows and with $f'$ and $f''$ being isomorphisms. This can be viewed, by completing with zeroes, as a double complex. Since the complex has finitely many non-zero components, the two standard spectral sequences that arise from the filtration by rows and the filtration by columns both converge to the homology of the total complex, which I shall denote $X$. The first spectral sequence ${}^IE$, which arises from the filtration by rows, has zero ${}^IE^1$ term, exactly because we have assumed that the rows are exact. Since ${}^IE$ converges to $H_\\bullet(X)$, we see that $H_\\bullet(X)=0$, that is, that the total complex is exact. Now the second spectral sequence ${}^{II}E$, which arises from the filtration by rows, has $1$st term ${}^{II}E_1$ as in the following diagram R            R'\n0 <---  ker f'   <---  ker f  <---  ker f'' <--- 0\n\n\n\n0 <--- coker f'' <--- coker f <--- coker f'' <--- 0\n                   K            K' with the horizontal maps $R$, $R'$, $K$ and $K'$ induced by the maps $r$, $r'$ and $k$, $k'$ in the original diagram. Since $f'$ and $f''$ are isomorphisms, this is really 0 <--- 0 <---  ker f  <--- 0 <--- 0\n\n\n\n0 <--- 0 <--- coker f <--- 0 <--- 0 It follows that all the differentials in the ${}^{II}E_1$ term are zero, so the ${}^{II}E_2$ in fact equals ${}^{II}E_1$ as a graded object. Moreover, the way the non-zero objects in ${}^{II}E_2$ are placed implies immediately that the differentials in all the terms ${}^{II}E_r$ with $r\\geq2$ vanish, so that ${}^{II}E_\\infty={}^{II}E_1$. Finally, the shape of ${}^{II}E_\\infty$ and the fact that ${}^{II}E$ converges to zero imply that ${}^{II}E_1$ is itself zero. In other words, $\\ker f$ and $\\operatorname{coker}f$ are zero: this, of course, tells us that $f$ is an isomorphism. (If we don't assume that $f'$ and $f''$ are isomorphisms, the ${}^{II}E_1$ has non-trivial differentials, and the spectral sequence ${}^{II}E$ only degenerates at  ${}^{II}E_3$. If you write down exactly what this means, you will obtain the Snake Lemma—: the one non-zero differential in ${}^{II}E_2$ is the connecting homomorphism)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem from the user's question on Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about proving the five lemma using spectral sequences as presented in McCleary's book, specifically Exercise 1.1. The user mentions that they know a proof using a double complex spectral sequence but that hasn't been covered yet in the book up to that point. They outline what they have learned so far: filtrations on graded spaces, setting up spectral sequences, collapse under certain conditions, bigraded algebras, and reconstructing H* from E∞. The user is unsure how to apply this knowledge directly and wonders if constructing a total complex is needed, which might not have been introduced yet.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the key assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem is to prove the five lemma using spectral sequences with the given background knowledge. The assumptions would include the tools and concepts that the user has available from Chapter 1 of McCleary's book.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each relevant concept or condition that the problem relies on, each on a separate line. The problem statement is to prove the five lemma using spectral sequences under those constraints.\n\nLet me check the example provided. The example lists assumptions about 'n' being an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove the divisibility of A(n) by 91. Translating that to the current case, the assumptions would be the mathematical tools the user has from Chapter 1, and the problem is proving the five lemma with spectral sequences using those tools.\n\nThe user mentions they know about filtrations, setting up spectral sequences, collapse conditions, bigraded algebras, and reconstructing H* from E∞. They also note that the double complex approach (like total complexes) hasn't been covered yet. So the assumptions should include these points. However, since the user is unsure if constructing a total complex is necessary, maybe the problem assumes that they can use the mentioned concepts without needing the double complex method.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would list each of these as separate assumptions. Let me draft them:\n\nAssumption: The proof uses a spectral sequence of a filtered complex.\nAssumption: The spectral sequence collapses at a certain page under appropriate conditions.\nAssumption: The reconstruction of H* from the E∞ page is known.\nAssumption: The five lemma's hypotheses are satisfied (i.e., the rows are exact, the maps commute, etc.).\nWait, but the five lemma's conditions are part of the problem's setup, not the tools available. The user's available tools are the spectral sequence concepts. So maybe the assumptions should be the tools from McCleary's Chapter 1, not the five lemma's hypotheses. The problem statement itself is to prove the five lemma using spectral sequences given those tools.\n\nSo the assumptions would be the concepts the user knows: filtrations on graded spaces, spectral sequences setup, collapse conditions, bigraded algebras, and reconstructing H* from E∞. But how to phrase each as a single line?\n\nMaybe:\n\nAssumption: The spectral sequence is set up for a filtered graded space.\nAssumption: The spectral sequence collapses at a certain page under appropriate conditions.\nAssumption: Bigraded algebras and their spectral sequences are known.\nAssumption: Reconstruction of H* from the E∞ page is possible.\nProblem: Prove the five lemma using spectral sequences.\n\nBut the original problem mentions the five lemma's context in algebraic topology and homological algebra, so maybe the assumptions should include that the setup is in an abelian category with exact sequences, etc., but the user's question is more about the spectral sequence method given their current knowledge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are the properties of the spectral sequence they can use. Since the user is in Chapter 1 of McCleary, which covers basic spectral sequences, filtrations, convergence, and bigraded algebras, but not double complexes yet, the problem must be solvable with those. The five lemma's hypotheses (exactness of rows, commutative diagram) are part of the problem's given, so they might not need to be listed as assumptions unless they're part of the problem's setup. However, the user's question is about how to apply the spectral sequence tools they know (from Chapter 1) to prove the five lemma, so the assumptions are the spectral sequence concepts they have, not the five lemma's conditions. Therefore, the problem is to use those spectral sequence tools to prove the five lemma. The actual five lemma's conditions (exact rows, commuting squares, etc.) are part of the problem's statement to prove, not the assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's condition. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions would include the hypotheses of the five lemma, but the user is specifically asking about the spectral sequence approach. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the original example had the problem to prove A(n) divisible by 91, but the assumption listed n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was flawed. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which narrows the problem. So maybe that was an error. But perhaps in the actual problem, maybe the divisibility by 7 was part of the original problem? The example might have had a typo. Anyway, perhaps the key is that the user wants to extract the problem's assumptions from the original question, filtering out unrelated info.\n\nIn the current case, the user's problem is to prove the five lemma using spectral sequences given the knowledge from Chapter 1 of McCleary. The problem's assumptions would then be the tools available (filtrations, spectral sequences setup, collapse conditions, bigraded algebras, reconstructing H*), and the problem is to apply those to prove the five lemma. However, the five lemma itself has its own hypotheses (exact rows, commuting squares, isomorphisms), which are part of the problem's statement. So perhaps the assumptions should include both the spectral sequence tools and the five lemma's hypotheses. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\", which is part of the problem's original statement, and then added another condition. Maybe in this case, the assumptions are the five lemma's hypotheses and the available spectral sequence tools. However, the user's question is more about how to use the spectral sequence tools they have (without double complexes) to prove the five lemma. The five lemma's conditions (the exactness, the commuting diagram, the isomorphisms) are part of the problem's setup. Therefore, the assumptions should list those hypotheses of the five lemma and the spectral sequence tools.\n\nBut the user's problem is how to apply their spectral sequence knowledge (as per Chapter 1) to prove the five lemma. Therefore, the assumptions are the spectral sequence concepts they know, and the problem is to prove the five lemma under those conditions. The five lemma's own hypotheses would be part of the problem's statement. For example, the five lemma states that if you have a commutative diagram with exact rows, and certain maps are isomorphisms, then the middle map is an isomorphism. So, the problem would be to prove that using spectral sequences, given the tools from Chapter 1.\n\nTherefore, structuring it:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The spectral sequence is constructed from a filtered graded space.\n- The spectral sequence collapses at a certain page.\n- Bigraded algebras and their spectral sequences are known.\n- Reconstruction of H* from the E∞ page is possible.\nProblem: Prove the five lemma using spectral sequences.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. The five lemma's own hypotheses are part of the problem's statement. The user wants to translate the five lemma's proof into spectral sequences using the tools from Chapter 1. So the problem is to prove the five lemma (under its usual hypotheses) using spectral sequences as per the given tools. Hence, the assumptions would be the five lemma's conditions and the available spectral sequence tools.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to assume the five lemma's hypotheses (the commutative diagram with exact rows, the maps being isos) and use spectral sequences to prove the middle map is an iso. So the assumptions would list the five lemma's conditions and the spectral sequence setup.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumption lists properties applied to one object each. So in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions about n. Translating to this problem, perhaps each condition of the five lemma is an assumption. For example:\n\nAssumption: The diagram has two exact rows of modules.\nAssumption: The diagram commutes.\nAssumption: The maps f, g, h, i are module homomorphisms.\nAssumption: The maps f, h are isomorphisms.\nAssumption: The spectral sequence is set up from a filtered complex.\nAssumption: The spectral sequence collapses at the second page.\nProblem: Prove that the middle map g is an isomorphism.\n\nBut I think the key is that the user's problem is to use spectral sequences (as per Chapter 1) to prove the five lemma. The five lemma's own conditions are part of the problem's setup. Therefore, the assumptions should include both the five lemma's hypotheses and the available spectral sequence tools. However, the user's confusion is about applying the spectral sequence tools without using double complexes. Therefore, the structured problem should list the spectral sequence-related assumptions (from Chapter 1) and the problem is to prove the five lemma under its usual conditions using those tools.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The spectral sequence is constructed from a filtered graded module.\nAssumption: The spectral sequence collapses at a specific page.\nAssumption: The reconstruction of H* from the E∞ page is known.\nAssumption: The five lemma's diagram commutes with exact rows.\nAssumption: The maps f, h in the five lemma diagram are isomorphisms.\nProblem: Prove that the middle map g in the five lemma diagram is an isomorphism using spectral sequences.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. For example, each line should be one condition. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption: The spectral sequence is associated with a filtered graded module.\nAssumption: The spectral sequence collapses at the E2 page.\nAssumption: The E∞ page allows reconstruction of the homology H*.\nAssumption: The five lemma diagram consists of two exact rows of modules.\nAssumption: The diagram commutes.\nAssumption: The maps f and h are isomorphisms.\nProblem: Prove that the middle map g is an isomorphism using spectral sequences.\n\nThis way, each assumption is a single condition. The problem is to prove the five lemma's conclusion (g is iso) using spectral sequences under these assumptions. The user's original question is about how to set up the spectral sequence given the tools from Chapter 1, so the assumptions should include both the spectral sequence setup and the five lemma's hypotheses. This structure follows the example where assumptions include the problem's conditions and any additional constraints (like divisibility by 7). Therefore, the answer should list each of these conditions as separate assumptions and then state the problem.",
