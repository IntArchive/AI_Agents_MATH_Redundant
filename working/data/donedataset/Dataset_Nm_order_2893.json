    "Content": "Ex. 8.5 - Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering (Riley) By considering the matrices\n  $$ A = \\left( \\begin{matrix}\n        1 & 0 \\\\\n        0 & 0 \\\\\n        \\end{matrix} \\right) \n\\text{ ,  } B = \\left( \\begin{matrix}\n        0 & 0 \\\\\n        3 & 4 \\\\\n        \\end{matrix} \\right) \n$$\n  show that $AB = 0$ does not imply that either $A$ or $B$ is the zero matrix, but that it does imply that at least one of them is singular. So, my reasoning was the following: It's not difficult to compute $AB = \\left( \\begin{matrix}\n        0 & 0 \\\\\n        0 & 0 \\\\\n        \\end{matrix} \\right) $, in fact it's really even implied in the question. So, assume that $A, B$ are each non-singular - i.e. they are invertible. Thus, $A^{-1}AB=B$, and $ABB^{-1}=A$. But $AB$ is a zero matrix, so $A=B=0$. Thus proven that the initial assumption $A, B$ are non-singular is false. Is my reasoning correct? I ask because the 'hints and answers' said simply \"Use the property of the determinant of a matrix product.\" While I don't expect there to be only one proof, it's a tad disconcerting for it to so flatly suggest a different method - I'm not nearly confident enough in my ability to disregard it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof is good. A product $AB$ can be the zero matrix with $A$ being invertible (or non-singular): just take $B=0$. Your assignment is to prove that from $AB=0$ it follows that one among $A$ and $B$ is singular. Now, if $A$ is invertible, then $AB=0$ implies $B=A^{-1}AB=A^{-1}0=0$, so $B$ is certainly singular. QED Determinants are surely not needed for this. You can prove more: if $AB=0$ and both $A$ and $B$ are non zero, then both are singular. Indeed, take a nonzero column of $B$, call it $v$; then $Av=0$ and so $A$ is singular. Then apply the same to $B^TA^T$, showing that $B^T$ is singular.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the question according to the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. Let me read through the original question again.\n\nThe problem is from an exercise in Riley's Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering. The user is considering two matrices A and B, given as:\n\nA = [[1, 0], [0, 0]]\nB = [[0, 0], [3, 4]]\n\nThey need to show two things: first, that AB = 0 doesn't imply either A or B is the zero matrix, and second, that this implies at least one of A or B is singular. The user then presents their own reasoning using inverses and asks if it's correct, while the book's hint suggests using determinants. The user is concerned about the discrepancy in methods.\n\nTo format this into the required structure, I need to list the assumptions line by line. Let's see:\n\n1. The first part is showing AB = 0 doesn't require A or B to be zero matrices. The example matrices A and B are given. So assumptions here would be the definitions of A and B. However, in the example provided earlier, the assumptions were more about the conditions on the variables. Here, the matrices are specific, so maybe the assumptions are the properties of these matrices? Wait, but in the problem statement, the user is supposed to show a general statement, but using these specific matrices as an example. Hmm, maybe the problem is to use these specific matrices to demonstrate the general principle.\n\nWait, the problem says \"By considering the matrices A and B... show that AB=0 does not imply...\". So the problem is not a general proof but an example using these specific matrices. Therefore, the assumptions would be about the specific matrices given. Let me check the example again. In the example given by the user, the original problem was about proving a statement for every integer n, but the formatted assumption listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had to prove for every integer n, so maybe the example had a mistake? Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption said \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption added that n is divisible by 7. But that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Maybe the example had a different problem. Let me recheck the example.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's a problem because the original statement is for every integer n, but the formatted assumption restricts n to being divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrectly formatted. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But the user is asking me to follow their format, so I need to see how they did it, even if there's a mistake. In their example, they took the original problem which had \"for every integer n\" and turned it into an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a miscommunication. Maybe the original problem had an extra condition, but the example here might be wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction based on their example.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is given specific matrices A and B. So the assumptions would be about these matrices. However, the problem is to show that AB=0 doesn't imply A or B is zero, but that at least one is singular. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- A is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]]\n- B is the matrix [[0,0],[3,4]]\n- AB is the zero matrix\n- Neither A nor B is the zero matrix\n- The problem wants to show that at least one of A or B is singular.\n\nWait, but how to structure this. The user's example for the previous problem listed assumptions as conditions on the variables. Here, the problem is to show a general statement by using specific matrices. So perhaps the assumptions are the given matrices and their properties. But in the problem statement, the user is to show that AB=0 does not imply either A or B is zero, but that at least one is singular. So the specific matrices are examples where AB=0 but neither A nor B is zero, and then to show that in such a case, at least one must be singular.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a 2x2 matrix with entries [[1,0],[0,0]]\n- B is a 2x2 matrix with entries [[0,0],[3,4]]\n- AB is the zero matrix\n- Neither A nor B is the zero matrix\n\nBut the problem is to show that in such a case, at least one is singular. Wait, but the problem is structured as \"By considering the matrices A and B, show that AB=0 does not imply...\". So the task is to use these matrices to show two things: first, that AB=0 doesn't require A or B to be zero (which is shown by example), and second, that this implies at least one is singular (which might be a general statement, but demonstrated through these matrices).\n\nBut in the user's own reasoning, they argue by contradiction: assume both A and B are non-singular, then AB=0 would imply A=0 and B=0, which contradicts the example. Therefore, at least one must be singular.\n\nBut the problem's hint suggests using determinants, since det(AB) = det(A)det(B), and if AB=0, then det(AB)=0, so det(A)det(B)=0, implying at least one determinant is zero, hence singular.\n\nSo the problem requires showing two parts: first, that AB=0 does not imply A or B is zero (by example), and second, that AB=0 implies at least one is singular (either via determinant or via invertible matrices).\n\nNow, to structure the problem as per the user's format:\n\nAssumption: Each line should address one property or condition of one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a 2x2 matrix with entries [[1,0],[0,0]],\nB is a 2x2 matrix with entries [[0,0],[3,4]],\nAB is the zero matrix,\nNeither A nor B is the zero matrix.\n\nProblem:\nShow that AB = 0 does not imply either A or B is the zero matrix, but that it does imply that at least one of them is singular.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were conditions on the variable n, but here the assumptions are about specific matrices. However, the problem is to use these matrices to show the general statement. Wait, maybe the problem is more general, but the example matrices are given as part of the problem. So perhaps the problem is not about these specific matrices, but using them to illustrate the general case. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question title: \"Showing AB=0 does not imply either A,B=0, but that singular\"\n\nThe question body says: \"Ex. 8.5 - ... By considering the matrices A and B (as given), show that AB=0 does not imply that either A or B is the zero matrix, but that it does imply that at least one of them is singular.\"\n\nSo the problem is to use these specific matrices to demonstrate the two claims. Therefore, the assumptions would be the specific matrices A and B, and the results computed from them. But the first part is to show that AB=0 with A and B non-zero, which is done via example. The second part is to show that in such a case, at least one is singular, which can be done either by determinant or invertibility.\n\nSo for the formatted problem:\n\nAssumptions would include the specific matrices, that their product is zero, and that neither is the zero matrix. However, according to the user's example, the assumptions are conditions on the variables. Here, the problem is about matrices, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a 2x2 matrix with first row [1, 0] and second row [0, 0],\nB is a 2x2 matrix with first row [0, 0] and second row [3, 4],\nThe product AB is the zero matrix,\nA is not the zero matrix,\nB is not the zero matrix.\n\nProblem:\nShow that AB = 0 does not imply either A or B is the zero matrix, but that it does imply that at least one of them is singular.\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a 2x2 matrix with entries [[1, 0], [0, 0]],\nB is a 2x2 matrix with entries [[0, 0], [3, 4]],\nAB is the zero matrix,\nA is not the zero matrix,\nB is not the zero matrix.\n\nProblem:\nShow that AB = 0 does not imply either A or B is the zero matrix, but that it does imply that at least one of them is singular.\n\nWait, but the problem is to use these matrices to show the general statement. The first part is demonstrated by the example (AB=0 but A and B are non-zero), and the second part is a general implication (if AB=0 and neither A nor B is zero, then at least one is singular). So perhaps the assumptions should include the specific matrices for the first part and general conditions for the second part. But according to the user's example, they structured the problem by listing assumptions that included both the variable's conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), even though the original problem was for every integer n. So maybe the user's example had a mistake, but I need to follow their format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are only the specific matrices, and the problem is to show for these matrices that AB=0 doesn't imply A or B is zero, and that at least one is singular. But in that case, showing for these matrices would be trivial, because you can compute their determinants. A has determinant 0 (since it's a diagonal matrix with a zero on the diagonal), so A is singular. B has determinant (0)(4) - (0)(3) = 0? Wait, no, B is [[0,0],[3,4]], so determinant is (0)(4) - (0)(3) = 0. So both A and B are singular. Wait, but the problem says \"at least one is singular\", but in this example, both are singular. But the user's proof is by contradiction: assuming both are non-singular leads to a contradiction, hence at least one must be singular. So the example serves to show that AB=0 can happen even if neither A nor B is zero, and in that case, at least one (in fact both here) is singular.\n\nBut the problem's general statement is that if AB=0 and neither A nor B is zero, then at least one is singular. The example shows that such a case exists, and then the general proof is needed.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, the user wants to filter unrelated information and list assumptions. The original problem says \"by considering the matrices A and B\", so the assumptions are those matrices. Then the problem is to show the two things.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the specific matrices and their properties, then the problem is to show the two conclusions.\n\nBut following the user's example, which took a general problem and added assumptions (even if conflicting), perhaps here the assumptions are the given matrices and their product. Wait, in the user's example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted assumption added that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. So maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a different problem where the assumption was that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem had a different condition. It's possible the example was mistyped.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the key points are:\n\n- Given matrices A and B as specified.\n- Compute AB and show it's zero.\n- Show that neither A nor B is the zero matrix (which is evident from their entries).\n- Then, show that this implies at least one of A or B is singular.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the definitions of A and B, and the problem is to show the two things.\n\nBut in the user's example, the assumptions were listed as properties of n. Here, the matrices are specific, so the assumptions are their definitions. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrix A is [[1, 0], [0, 0]],\nMatrix B is [[0, 0], [3, 4]],\nAB is the zero matrix,\nA is not the zero matrix,\nB is not the zero matrix.\n\nProblem:\nShow that AB = 0 does not imply either A or B is the zero matrix, but that it does imply that at least one of them is singular.\n\nWait, but the fact that AB is zero and neither A nor B is zero is part of the example, which demonstrates the first part. The second part is a general implication. However, the problem statement in the original question is to \"show that AB=0 does not imply...\" by considering these matrices. So the problem is to use these matrices to demonstrate both points. Therefore, the assumptions are about these matrices, and the problem is to show the two conclusions based on them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in two parts: first, using the example to show that AB=0 doesn't require A or B to be zero; second, generally showing that if AB=0 and neither is zero, then at least one is singular. But the problem says \"by considering the matrices A and B\", so maybe both parts are to be addressed using these matrices.\n\nBut the second part, that AB=0 implies at least one is singular, is a general statement. The example shows that in this case, both are singular. But the general proof would be required. However, the problem might expect the student to use the example and then the general proof. But in terms of formatting, how to structure that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just to show for these specific matrices that AB=0, neither A nor B is zero, and that at least one is singular. But in this case, both are singular, so that would suffice. However, the problem seems to want to make a general statement, using the example as illustration.\n\nGiven the user's example had assumptions that might have been incorrect, but I need to follow their format. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Matrix A is defined as [[1, 0], [0, 0]].\n- Matrix B is defined as [[0, 0], [3, 4]].\n- The product AB equals the zero matrix.\n- Matrix A is not the zero matrix.\n- Matrix B is not the zero matrix.\n\nProblem: Show that AB = 0 does not imply either A or B is the zero matrix, but that it does imply that at least one of them is singular.\n\nBut in this case, the problem is to use these matrices to demonstrate the general principle. Therefore, the assumptions are the specific matrices and their properties, and the problem is to show the two parts. However, the second part (at least one is singular) can be shown by noting that determinant of A is 0 (since it's a diagonal matrix with a zero entry), so A is singular. Similarly, determinant of B is 0*4 - 0*3 = 0, so B is also singular. Therefore, both are singular, hence at least one is singular. But the general proof is still needed, which the user did via assuming both are invertible leading to contradiction.\n\nBut the problem structure as per the user's example would require listing the assumptions and the problem. So I think the formatted problem would be as follows.",
