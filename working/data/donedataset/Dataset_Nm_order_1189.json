    "Content": "Suppose that $(X,\\mathcal{E},\\mu)$ is a non-atomic finite measure space (i.e. for every $E \\in \\mathcal{E}$ with $\\mu(E)>0$ there exists $F \\subset E$ measurable such that $0<\\mu(F) <\\mu(E)$.) a) Prove that for every $ \\varepsilon >0$ there is a finite partition of $X$ in measurable subsets $X_1,..,X_n$ such that $\\mu(X_i)\\leq \\varepsilon$. b) Prove that for every $\\alpha \\in [0,\\mu(X)]$ there exists $E \\in \\mathcal{E}$ with $\\mu(E)=\\alpha$. I guess that a) is given to prove b) more easily. I have the following idea of solution for a) (inspired from this Wikipedia post , which proves b)  ) Denote \n$$ \\Gamma = \\{ (X_1,..,X_n) : n >> \\mu(X)/\\varepsilon, X_i \\text{ are disjoint }, \\mu(X_i)\\leq \\varepsilon \\}$$\nordered by componentwise inclusion. Totally ordered parts $(Y_\\alpha)$ of $\\Gamma$ have an upper bound element $(\\bigcup Y_\\alpha^i)_{i=1}^n$ which is still in $\\Gamma$. By Zorn's lemma $\\Gamma$ has maximal elements. If a maximal $(X_1..X_n)$ element is not a partition, then we can replace it with something better, of the form $(X_1,..,X_n\\cup A)$ where $A \\subset X \\setminus (X_1 \\cup..\\cup X_n)$ and $\\mu(A)>0$. My questions are: 1) Is my solution of a) correct? I feel that the part with the upper bound element may not work, since there might be noncountable unions. 2) What is a simpler solution of a)?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Clearly b) implies a), so I directly prove b). Let $E\\in\\mathcal E$ be such that $\\mu(E)>0$ . Let $A_1\\in\\mathcal E$ be such that $A_1\\subseteq E$ and $0<\\mu(A_1)<\\mu(E)$ . Then either $\\mu(A_1)\\leq\\mu(E)/2$ or $\\mu(E\\setminus A_1)\\leq\\mu(E)/2$ , so if necessary we consider $E\\setminus A_1$ instead of $A_1$ , and we can assume that $0<\\mu(A_1)<\\mu(E)/2$ . Now repeat the process with $A_1$ instead of $E$ , obtaining a subset $A_2$ of $A_1$ such that $0<\\mu(A_2)<\\mu(E)/2^2$ . Continuing in this way we see that $E$ contains subsets with  arbitrarily small positive measure. Let $\\epsilon\\in\\bigl(0,\\mu(X)\\bigr)$ , and let $A_1\\subseteq X$ be such that $0<\\mu(A_1)<\\epsilon$ . Edit: I expanded this part of the argument, at request of @Michael Greinecker for further clarification. Suppose that pairwise disjoint subsets $A_1,\\dots,A_n$ of $X$ have been chosen such that $D_n=A_1\\cup\\cdots\\cup A_n$ satisfies $\\mu(D_n)<\\epsilon$ . The first paragraph shows that the family $$\\mathcal F_n=\\bigl\\{C\\subseteq X\\setminus D_n: 0<\\mu(C)<\\epsilon-\\mu(D_n)\\bigr\\}$$ is nonempty; however, we cannot determine at this point if the family $$\\mathcal G_n=\\bigl\\{C\\subseteq X\\setminus D_n: \\frac1n\\leq\\mu(C)<\\epsilon-\\mu(D_n)\\bigr\\}$$ is nonempty as well. We take $A_{n+1}\\in\\mathcal G_n$ if $\\mathcal G_n\\ne\\emptyset$ and $A_{n+1}\\in\\mathcal F_n$ otherwise. If $A=\\cup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n$ , then $\\mu(A)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\mu(A_n)\\leq\\epsilon$ . Suppose that the strict inequality holds, that is $\\mu(A)<\\epsilon$ , and let $B\\subseteq X\\setminus A$ be such that $0<\\mu(B)<\\epsilon-\\mu(A)$ . Then for all $n$ we have $B\\subseteq X\\setminus D_n$ , and since $\\mu(D_n)\\leq\\mu(A)$ , it follows that $0<\\mu(B)<\\epsilon-\\mu(D_n)$ . If $N$ satisfies $\\frac1N\\leq\\mu(B)$ then for all $n\\geq N$ we have $B\\in\\mathcal G_n$ . Thus, $\\mathcal G_n\\ne\\emptyset$ , so by construction necessarily we have $\\mu(A_n)\\geq\\frac1n$ for all $n\\geq N$ , which is absurd because in this case $\\mu(A)\\geq\\sum_{n=N}^\\infty\\mu(A_n)\\geq\\sum_{n=N}^\\infty\\frac1n=\\infty$ . This contradiction shows that $\\mu(A)=\\epsilon$ , as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. The user provided an example, so I need to follow that. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Simpler proof - Non atomic measures.\" The question has two parts, a) and b). The user is focusing on part a) here. The problem statement is about a non-atomic finite measure space. Let's break down the assumptions first.\n\nThe measure space (X, E, μ) is non-atomic. The definition given is that for every E in E with μ(E) > 0, there exists a measurable subset F of E such that 0 < μ(F) < μ(E). So that's the non-atomic condition. Also, the measure space is finite, meaning μ(X) is finite.\n\nThe problem a) asks to prove that for every ε > 0, there exists a finite partition of X into measurable subsets X₁, ..., Xₙ with each μ(Xᵢ) ≤ ε.\n\nThe user's approach involves using Zorn's lemma on a certain set Γ of partitions. They ordered Γ by componentwise inclusion and considered maximal elements. But they have doubts about the upper bound in Zorn's lemma application, especially regarding uncountable unions. They also ask for a simpler solution.\n\nNow, the task is to structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. The example given lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So for part a), the assumptions are:\n\n1. (X, E, μ) is a measure space.\n2. μ is non-atomic (for every E in E with μ(E) > 0, there exists F subset of E with 0 < μ(F) < μ(E)).\n3. μ is a finite measure (μ(X) is finite).\n4. ε is a positive real number.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that there exists a finite partition of X into measurable subsets each with measure ≤ ε.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem part a) doesn't mention any other conditions beyond ε > 0 and the measure space being non-atomic and finite. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The measure space (X, E, μ) is non-atomic.\n- The measure μ is finite.\n- ε is a positive real number.\n\nBut need to check if there's more. The original problem mentions part a) and the user's solution, but the actual problem to structure is part a). So the assumptions for part a) are:\n\n1. (X, E, μ) is a measure space.\n2. For every E in E with μ(E) > 0, there exists F ⊂ E measurable such that 0 < μ(F) < μ(E) (non-atomic).\n3. μ(X) is finite.\n4. ε > 0 is given.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove the existence of the finite partition with each part's measure ≤ ε.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are the properties of the measure space and ε. So yes, each condition on a separate line.",
