    "Content": "I am trying to work out the details of following example from page 101 of Tu's An Introduction to Manifolds : Example 9.3. Let $\\Gamma$ be the graph of the function $f(x) =\n \\sin(1/x)$ on the interval $]0, 1[$, and let $S$ be the union of\n  $\\Gamma$ and the open interval $I=\\{(0,y)\\in \\mathbb{R^2} |−1<y<1\\}$. The subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{R^2}$ is not a regular submanifold for the\n  following reason: if $p$ is in the interval $I$, then there is no\n  adapted chart containing $p$, since any sufficiently small\n  neighborhood $U$ of $p$ in $\\mathbb{R^2}$ intersects $S$ in infinitely\n  many components. Using Tu's definitions, I need to show that given a neighborhood $U$ of $p$, there exists no homeomorphism $\\phi$ from $U$ onto an open set of $V \\subset\\mathbb{R^2}$ with the property that $U \\cap S$ is the pre-image with respect to $\\phi$ of the $x$ or $y$ axes intersected with $V$. I am not sure where the fact that $U \\cap S$ has infinitely many components comes into play. I tried to derive a contradiction using this fact; but even if restrict my attention to connected neighborhoods $U$ of $p$, the intersection of the connected set $\\phi(U)$ with the $x$ or $y$ axes might have infinitely many components (I think), so there's no contradiction with the fact that homeomorphism preserves components. I would appreciate any help!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $X$ denote the $x$-axis. Assume that $U\\ni p$ is open and $\\phi(U)$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb R^2$ with $\\phi:U\\to \\phi(U)$ a homeomorphism. If $\\phi(U)$ intersects $X$ in several components, let $C$ denote the connected component containing $\\phi(p)$. Since $\\phi(U)$ is open, $\\phi(U)\\cap X$ is open in $X$. But $X\\approx\\mathbb R$ is locally connected, therefore components of open subsets are open. So $C$ is open and $X-C$ is closed in $X$. Since $X$ is closed in $\\mathbb R^2$, $X-C$ is closed in $\\mathbb R^2$ and $\\phi(U)-(X-C)$ is open. Applying $\\phi$ we get a homeomorphism $\\phi^{-1}(\\phi(U)-(X-C))\\approx \\phi(U)-(X-C)$, the later of which intersects the $x$-axis in just a single component, which is a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original question. The user mentioned that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem is about showing that the Topologist's Sine Curve, denoted as S, is not a regular submanifold of ℝ². The set S is defined as the union of Γ, which is the graph of sin(1/x) on the interval (0,1), and the interval I, which is the vertical segment from (0,-1) to (0,1). The key point here is that if p is in I, then any small neighborhood around p in ℝ² intersects S in infinitely many components. This is supposed to prevent the existence of an adapted chart (a homeomorphism that locally straightens S to a coordinate axis), but the user is confused about how exactly the infinite components lead to a contradiction.\n\nFirst, list the assumptions. The problem mentions:\n\n1. Γ is the graph of f(x) = sin(1/x) on ]0, 1[.\n2. S is the union of Γ and the open interval I = {(0, y) | −1 < y < 1}.\n3. p is a point in the interval I.\n4. Any sufficiently small neighborhood U of p in ℝ² intersects S in infinitely many components.\n5. Using Tu's definitions, we need to show there's no homeomorphism φ from U to an open set V in ℝ² such that U ∩ S is the preimage of the x-axis or y-axis intersected with V.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line. Let's parse these out:\n\n- Γ is defined as the graph of sin(1/x) on the interval (0,1). That's one assumption about Γ.\n- S is the union of Γ and I. Another assumption about S.\n- The point p is in I. So p's location is an assumption.\n- The neighborhood U of p intersects S in infinitely many components. This is a property of U ∩ S.\n- The problem requires showing no adapted chart exists, which is the goal, so that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nWait, the user also mentions using Tu's definitions. So maybe that's another assumption? But the user wants the problem section to state what needs to be proved. The original question is asking to show that S is not a regular submanifold because there's no adapted chart around p. The key assumptions leading to this are the definitions of Γ, S, the point p in I, and the intersection U ∩ S having infinitely many components.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- Γ is the graph of the function f(x) = sin(1/x) on the interval ]0, 1[.\n- S is the union of Γ and the open interval I = {(0, y) ∈ ℝ² | −1 < y < 1}.\n- p is a point in the interval I.\n- Any sufficiently small neighborhood U of p in ℝ² intersects S in infinitely many components.\n\nBut the last point is actually a given condition based on the structure of S. So these are the assumptions. The problem is to show that S is not a regular submanifold of ℝ² by showing no adapted chart exists around p, i.e., there's no homeomorphism φ from U to V such that U ∩ S is the preimage of the x-axis or y-axis.\n\nThe user's confusion is about how the infinite components play into this. In the problem statement, they need to connect the infinite components to the impossibility of such a homeomorphism. The key idea is that under a homeomorphism, the number of connected components should be preserved. If U ∩ S has infinitely many components, but the preimage of an axis in V under a homeomorphism would have only one or two components (since axes in ℝ² are lines, their intersection with an open set V would be intervals, which are connected or have a few components). Hence, the contradiction arises because a homeomorphism cannot map infinitely many components to a set with finitely many components.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, we need to present the assumptions and the problem as per the example. So the assumptions list the structure of S, the point p in I, and the intersection U ∩ S having infinitely many components. The problem is to show that S is not a regular submanifold by proving there's no adapted chart (homeomorphism) around p.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Γ is the graph of the function f(x) = sin(1/x) on the interval ]0, 1[.\n- S is the union of Γ and the open interval I = {(0, y) ∈ ℝ² | −1 < y < 1}.\n- p is a point in the interval I.\n- Any sufficiently small neighborhood U of p in ℝ² intersects S in infinitely many components.\n\nProblem: Prove that S is not a regular submanifold of ℝ² by showing there is no homeomorphism φ from U to an open set V ⊂ ℝ² such that U ∩ S is the preimage of the x-axis or y-axis under φ.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were more concise. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo the example's assumptions are conditions on the variables. Translating that to the current problem, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem statement that are necessary for the problem to hold. In this case, the structure of S, the point p being in I, and the intersection having infinitely many components are all given conditions. So the assumptions should be those given properties, not the definitions from Tu's book.\n\nThe user wants the problem structured into assumptions (given conditions) and the problem statement. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: Γ is the graph of f(x) = sin(1/x) on ]0, 1[.\n\nAssumption: S = Γ ∪ I, where I = {(0, y) | −1 < y < 1}.\n\nAssumption: p is a point in I.\n\nAssumption: For any sufficiently small neighborhood U of p in ℝ², U ∩ S has infinitely many components.\n\nProblem: Prove that S is not a regular submanifold of ℝ² by showing there exists no homeomorphism φ: U → V ⊂ ℝ² such that U ∩ S is φ⁻¹(x-axis ∩ V) or φ⁻¹(y-axis ∩ V).\n\nYes, this seems to follow the example's structure. Each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property. The problem is to show the non-existence of the adapted chart (homeomorphism) due to the infinite components.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would have these four assumptions and the problem statement as above.",
