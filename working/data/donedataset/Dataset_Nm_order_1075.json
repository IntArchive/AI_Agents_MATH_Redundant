    "AcceptedAnswer": "You should know that if $k$ is a field, then $k[x]$ is a UFD (even a Euclidean domain). So given $g(x)\\in A[x]$, first write it as $g(x) = cG(x)$, where $c$ is a constant and $G(x)$ is primitive. Then show that a primitive polynomial in $A[x]$ is irreducible if and only if it is irreducible when viewed as a polynomial in $k[x]$, where $k$ is the field of fractions of $A$. Then use this to take an arbitrary polynomial in $A[x]$, and factor it by \"factoring out the content, then factoring it over $k[x]$, and then \"lifting the factorization\" back to $A[x]$. The argument is exactly the same as that used in the case of $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with Gauss's Lemma. Now, since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD, then by this argument so is $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1]$; which means that so is $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1][x_2]\\cong\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2]$. Which means that so is $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2][x_3] = \\mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2,x_3]$. Etc. The same holds for polynomials over a field, since a field is trivially a UFD (or because you know that the first polynomial ring, $k[x_1]$, is a UFD).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. So first, I need to read the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"Does $A$ a UFD imply that $A[T]$ is also a UFD?\" And the question body mentions proving that if $A$ is a UFD, then $A[T]$ is a UFD, possibly using Gauss's lemma. It also asks about deducing that polynomial rings like $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ and $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ are UFDs.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The main assumption here is that $A$ is a UFD. The problem is to prove that $A[T]$ is also a UFD. Additionally, the user wants to deduce specific cases for $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $k[x_1,...]$. However, looking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that $n$ is an integer and divisible by 7. In the formatted problem, only the necessary assumptions were included. Here, the key assumption is that $A$ is a UFD. The other parts about $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $k$ might be separate problems or follow-up questions. But according to the example, maybe we need to focus only on the main problem.\n\nWait, the original example includes both parts of the problem. The user's example had an original problem with two parts (prove divisibility by 91 and another part about n being divisible by 7), but in the formatted version, they listed the assumption (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem as proving divisibility by 91. However, in this case, the original question is more about the implication from $A$ being UFD to $A[T]$ being UFD, and then deducing specific cases. But perhaps the main problem is \"Prove that $A$ a UFD implies $A[T]$ is a UFD\", with assumption that $A$ is a UFD. Then the other parts about $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $k[x_1,...]$ are separate deductions, which might not be part of the main problem. However, the user's instruction says to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So maybe the main problem is the first part, and the second part is a follow-up question. But according to the format, we need to list all assumptions for the problem.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the original question is two-fold: proving that $A$ UFD implies $A[T]$ UFD, and then deducing the specific cases. But perhaps in the format, we should split them into separate problems? But the example given by the user combines the problem into one. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to structure the main problem and list all necessary assumptions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had the number A(n) defined, and the formatted problem lists the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem to prove divisibility by 91. So here, the problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, given that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number is divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, it's changed to assuming n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would make the problem only for n divisible by 7. But perhaps that's part of the problem's actual conditions? Maybe the original problem had a typo or the user made a mistake in the example. Regardless, following the instruction, I need to structure the given problem as per the example.\n\nSo for the current problem: The user's question is \"Does $A$ a UFD imply that $A[T]$ is also a UFD?\" and wants to prove that. The problem is stated as \"I'm trying to prove that $A$ a UFD implies that $A[T]$ is a UFD. The only thing I am sure I could try to use is Gauss's lemma. Also, how can we deduce that the polynomial rings $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ and $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ are UFDs?\"\n\nSo the main problem here is to prove that if $A$ is a UFD, then $A[T]$ is a UFD. The assumptions would be that $A$ is a UFD. The other part about $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,...]$ and $k[x_1,...]$ are separate deductions. But in the example, the original problem had two parts (prove divisibility by 91 and another part about n divisible by 7), but the formatted problem only included the first part. However, the user's instruction says \"filter the unrelated information and structure that problem\". So perhaps the second part is a separate question, and we should structure only the main problem. Alternatively, maybe both parts are part of the problem. Let me read again.\n\nThe original question is: \"Prove that $A$ a UFD implies that $A[T]$ is a UFD. The only thing I am sure I could try to use is Gauss's lemma. Also, how can we deduce that the polynomial rings $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ and $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ are UFDs?\"\n\nSo there are two parts here: 1) Prove if A is UFD then A[T] is UFD; 2) Deduce that Z[...] and k[...] are UFDs. So maybe the problem is both parts. But in the example, they only structured the first part. However, the user's example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" as the problem, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might have been an error. Alternatively, maybe the example is not perfectly aligned. Anyway, following the instruction, I need to structure the problem given in the current case.\n\nThe key assumption is that $A$ is a UFD. The problem is to prove $A[T]$ is a UFD. The second part about Z and k[x] would follow from the first result, since Z is a UFD and k[x] is a UFD (if k is a field), so their polynomial rings would also be UFDs. But perhaps the user wants to include the deduction as part of the problem. However, in the original example, they didn't include multiple parts but focused on one. So maybe here, the main problem is \"Prove that if A is a UFD, then A[T] is a UFD\", with assumption that A is a UFD. Then the deduction part is a separate problem, but since the user mentions it in the same question, perhaps we need to include both.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be structured as two separate problems. But the format given in the example has only one problem. So maybe the user wants to split the problem into assumptions and problem, where the problem includes both parts. But the example has only one problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the main statement, and the deduction is a corollary. So the assumptions are that A is a UFD, and the problem is to prove A[T] is a UFD, and deduce those two cases. But the example only included the main problem. Maybe in this case, the problem is \"Prove that A a UFD implies A[T] is a UFD, and deduce that Z[x1..xn] and k[x1..xn] are UFDs.\" But how to structure that. The assumptions would be A is a UFD, and for the deductions, additional assumptions like Z is a UFD and k is a field. But maybe the user wants to have two separate problems. However, the original question seems to present this as one problem with two parts. Alternatively, perhaps the main problem is the first part, and the deductions are separate, but since they are part of the question, they need to be included. However, the example didn't split into multiple problems. So given that, perhaps we need to list the assumption as \"A is a UFD\" and the problem as \"Prove that A[T] is a UFD and deduce that Z[x1..xn] and k[x1..xn] are UFDs.\" But according to the example, the problem line is a single statement. Alternatively, perhaps the deductions are separate problems, but the user is asking both in one question. So maybe we need to structure the problem as two parts, but the format example shows one problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the main problem is proving A[T] is a UFD given A is a UFD. The deductions about Z and k[x] are applications, which might not need separate assumptions but follow from the main result. So the problem would be:\n\nAssumption: A is a UFD.\n\nProblem: Prove that A[T] is a UFD. Deduce that Z[x1,...,xn] and k[x1,...,xn] are UFDs.\n\nBut how to phrase that. The example had the problem as a single statement. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: A is a UFD.\n\nProblem: Prove that A[T] is a UFD. Additionally, deduce that the polynomial rings Z[x1,...,xn] and k[x1,...,xn] are UFDs.\n\nBut I need to follow the format where the problem is a single statement. Alternatively, the problem is two parts. But the example had only one problem line. The example's original problem had two parts (divisible by 91 and n divisible by 7), but the formatted problem listed the assumption and the problem as one. Hmm, perhaps the original example was not the best, but according to the instructions, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn this case, the main assumption is that A is a UFD. Then the problem is to prove A[T] is a UFD, and deduce the other rings. However, the deduction part might require additional assumptions. For example, to deduce that Z[x1...] is a UFD, we need to know that Z is a UFD. Similarly, k[x1...] requires k[x1] is a UFD, which would be the case if k is a field. But in the original question, the user mentions those as separate deductions. So perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a UFD.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A[T] is a UFD. Deduce that the polynomial rings Z[x1,...,xn] and k[x1,...,xn] are UFDs.\n\nBut the deductions might require additional assumptions. For instance, to get Z[x1..xn], since Z is a UFD, then by the main result, Z[x1] is a UFD, then Z[x1,x2] = (Z[x1])[x2] is a UFD, and so on. Similarly, if k is a field, then k[x1] is a UFD (since fields are UFDs), so k[x1,...,xn] is a UFD by induction. However, the original question doesn't state that k is a field, but in standard math, k[x1..xn] is a UFD if k is a field. So perhaps the deductions don't require additional assumptions beyond the main result. Therefore, the problem is to use the main result (A UFD implies A[T] UFD) to conclude that Z and k[x] polynomial rings are UFDs.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a UFD.\n\nProblem: Prove that A[T] is a UFD. Additionally, deduce that the polynomial rings Z[x1,...,xn] and k[x1,...,xn] are UFDs.\n\nBut the example's problem line was a single statement, but here, it's two parts. However, the user's instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format\" with the example. The example's problem line was one statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem line here should be the main problem, and the deduction part is a follow-up but included in the problem line.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question includes both parts, perhaps we need to list all the assumptions required for both parts. For the first part, the assumption is A is a UFD. For the second part, to deduce Z[x1..xn] is a UFD, we need Z is a UFD. Similarly, k[x1..xn] requires k is a field (hence k[x1] is a UFD). But the original problem doesn't mention these, but the deduction part is asking to deduce those. So perhaps in the assumptions, we need to include:\n\n- A is a UFD.\n- Z is a UFD.\n- k is a field.\n\nBut the user is trying to deduce that Z and k[x] rings are UFDs. So maybe the problem is structured with the main assumption for the first part, and the deductions don't require listing assumptions because they follow from the main result. Therefore, the problem line is \"Prove that A[T] is a UFD. Deduce that Z[x1,...,xn] and k[x1,...,xn] are UFDs.\" with the only assumption being A is a UFD. However, to deduce Z[x1...], we need Z is a UFD, which it is, but that's not listed as an assumption here. Maybe the assumptions only pertain to the first part of the problem. Since the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem was for every integer n, but perhaps that example was incorrect. Given that, perhaps here, the assumption is only A is a UFD, and the problem is to prove A[T] is a UFD and deduce the other rings. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a UFD.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A[T]$ is a UFD. Deduce that the polynomial rings $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ and $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ are UFDs.\n\nBut the problem line includes two tasks. However, the example's problem line was a single task. The user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which in the example combines two parts into the problem line. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is not a good one. Anyway, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nGiven that, the main assumption is A is a UFD, and the problem is to prove A[T] is a UFD. The deductions about Z and k[x] are separate but related. However, the original question mentions them in the same problem. So perhaps we need to structure it as:\n\nAssumption:\n- $A$ is a UFD.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A[T]$ is a UFD. Additionally, deduce that the polynomial rings $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ and $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ are UFDs.\n\nBut I need to check if the deductions require additional assumptions. For $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,...x_n]$, since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD, by applying the main result inductively, each step adds a variable, so $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1]$ is a UFD, then $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2]$ is a UFD, etc. Similarly, if $k$ is a field, then $k[x_1]$ is a UFD (since fields are UFDs), so $k[x_1,...,x_n]$ is a UFD by induction. But the problem statement doesn't specify that $k$ is a field. So perhaps the deduction for $k[x_1,...,x_n]$ requires an assumption that $k$ is a field. However, in the original question, the user just says \"k[x_1,...,x_n]\" without specifying. Therefore, maybe the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\n- $A$ is a UFD.\n- $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD.\n- $k$ is a field.\n\nBut $\\mathbb{Z}$ being a UFD is a known fact, so perhaps it's redundant. Similarly, $k$ being a field is necessary for $k[x]$ to be a UFD. However, in the original problem, the user is asking to deduce these, so maybe the assumptions are only for the first part, and the deductions use known properties (like $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD and $k$ is a field) implicitly. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $A$ is a UFD.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A[T]$ is a UFD. Deduce that the polynomial rings $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ and $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ are UFDs.\n\nBut in this case, to deduce $k[x_1,...,x_n]$, we need $k$ to be a UFD, but fields are UFDs. However, in the problem statement, the user might be implying that $k$ is a field. So perhaps we need to include that as an assumption for the deduction part. But since the original question doesn't specify, maybe it's considered general knowledge. This is getting a bit complicated, but following the example, where assumptions were listed even if they might be part of the problem statement, perhaps here we list only the main assumption for the first part. The deductions would then follow from the main result plus known facts (like $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD and $k$ is a field). Since the user is asking to deduce those polynomial rings, but the original problem doesn't state the conditions on $k$, maybe we need to assume that $k$ is a field in the assumptions. But how to structure that.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is structured as two separate problems: one with assumption A is a UFD, problem to prove A[T] is a UFD; and another problem with assumptions Z is a UFD and k is a field, problem to prove their polynomial rings are UFDs. But the original question combines them into one. Therefore, perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n- $A$ is a UFD.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A[T]$ is a UFD. Deduce that the polynomial rings $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ and $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ are UFDs.\n\nBut the deductions require additional knowledge (like Z is a UFD, k is a field). However, since the user asks to \"deduce\", those might be considered as part of the problem's solution, not assumptions. Therefore, they don't need to be listed as assumptions. Hence, the formatted problem is as above.\n\nAnother angle: In the example, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory, but perhaps the original problem had a mistake, or the example is incorrect. Regardless, I should follow the user's instruction to filter unrelated information and structure the problem accordingly. The original question here is about proving A UFD implies A[T] UFD, using Gauss's lemma, and deducing the other rings. The key assumption is A is a UFD. The problem is to prove A[T] is a UFD and deduce those specific cases. Therefore, the correct formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $A$ is a UFD.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A[T]$ is a UFD. Deduce that the polynomial rings $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ and $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ are UFDs.\n\nEven though the deductions require additional facts, those facts (Z is a UFD, k is a field) are considered background knowledge and not part of the problem's assumptions. The user is expected to know or use those facts in the deduction step. Hence, they don't need to be listed as assumptions here.",
