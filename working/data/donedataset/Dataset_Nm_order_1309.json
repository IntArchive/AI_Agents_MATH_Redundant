    "Content": "Let the space be $X$ and $\\rm{id} \\simeq x_0$  where $\\rm{id}$ is the identity map on $X$ and $\\rm x_0$ is some fixed point in $X$.   How do I show that for any two points $a,b \\in X$ there is a continuous path $f:[0,1] \\to X$ such that $f(0) = a, f(1) = b$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will add my answer here to give the readers of this question a bit more explanation as to how one could prove this. Proof: Suppose that $X$ is contractible. Choose any two points $a, b \\in X$. We will construct a path between $a$ and $b$. Since $X$ is contractible, the identity map $\\operatorname{id}_{X} : X \\to X$ defined by $\\operatorname{id}_X(x) = x$ for all $x \\in X$, is null-homotopic. That means that $\\operatorname{id}_X$ is homotopic to a constant map $c_p : X \\to X$ defined by $c_p(x) = p$ for all $x \\in X$.  Let $H : X \\times I \\to X$ be the homotopy between $\\operatorname{id}_X$ and $c_p$. Then $H$ is continuous and $$H(x, 0) = \\operatorname{id}_X(x)= x \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\forall x \\in X$$ $$H(x, 1) = c_p(x) = p \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\forall x \\in X$$ Now the idea to construct the path from $a$ to $b$ is the following, first we define a path $\\varphi : I \\to X$ from $a$ to $p$ by $\\varphi(t) = H(a, t)$. Note that $\\varphi(0) = H(a, 0) = a$ and $\\varphi(1) = H(a, 1) = p$  so $\\varphi$ is indeed a path from $a$ to $p$. Then we define a path $\\psi : I \\to X$ from $b$ to $p$  by $\\psi(t) = H(b, t)$. Again note that $\\psi(0) = H(b, 0) = b$ and $\\psi(1) = H(b, 1) = p$  so $\\psi$ is indeed a path from $b$ to $p$. Now we wish to combine these two paths and traverse them 'at twice speed' to get a path $\\gamma : I \\to X$ that goes from $a$ (through $p$) to $b$. But right now we have a path from $b$ to $p$, and we need a path from $p$ to $b$ to make this idea work. To remedy this problem we define what's called a 'reverse path' of the path $\\psi$ which goes from $b$ to $p$. Define $\\psi^{-1} : I \\to X$ by $\\psi^{-1}(t) = \\psi(1-t) = H(b, 1-t)$. Then you can check that $\\psi^{-1}$ is a path from $p$ to $b$. Now finally define $\\gamma : I \\to X$ by $$\\gamma(t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\varphi(2t) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\ \\  \\ 0 \\leq t \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n\\psi^{-1}(2t-1) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\ \\frac{1}{2} \\leq t \\leq 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nYou can check that $\\gamma(0) = a$ and $\\gamma(1) = b$ and that $\\gamma$ is continuous by the gluing lemma since $\\varphi(1) = \\psi^{-1}(0)$.Thus $\\gamma$ is a path from $a$ to $b$. Hence $X$ is path-connected as desired. $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me read the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"A contractible space is path connected.\" The question states: Let the space be X and id ≃ x₀ where id is the identity map on X and x₀ is some fixed point in X. How do I show that for any two points a,b ∈ X there is a continuous path f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = a, f(1) = b?\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, the problem is about a contractible space. Contractible means that the identity map is homotopic to a constant map. The given information is that id ≃ x₀, which is a contraction of X to the point x₀. The goal is to show path connectedness, meaning any two points can be connected by a path.\n\nAssumptions to extract:\n\n1. X is a topological space. (This is implied because the question is about a space and paths, which are topological concepts.)\n2. The identity map on X (id: X → X) is homotopic to the constant map at x₀ (x₀: X → X, sending all points to x₀). So, id ≃ x₀. This is the definition of contractible, so X is contractible.\n3. x₀ is a fixed point in X. (Given explicitly.)\n4. The problem asks to show that for any two points a and b in X, there exists a continuous path connecting them. So the path connectedness is the conclusion, but the assumptions leading to it are the contractibility.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't explicitly state X is a topological space, but in context, when talking about homotopy and paths, we assume X is a topological space. However, maybe I should list that as an assumption? The original problem might assume that X is a topological space, so it's part of the problem's setup. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- X is a topological space.\n- The identity map on X (id_X) is homotopic to the constant map at x₀ (i.e., id_X ≃ x₀).\n- x₀ is a fixed point in X.\n\nProblem: Show that for any two points a, b ∈ X, there exists a continuous path f: [0,1] → X with f(0) = a and f(1) = b.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions are more about the conditions applied to specific objects. For example, in their example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nSo here, the first assumption is that X is a topological space. The second is that the identity map on X is homotopic to the constant map at x₀. The third is that x₀ is a fixed point in X. But maybe the homotopy is between the identity and x₀, which is a constant map, so the assumption is that the space is contractible (since contractible means that the identity map is null-homotopic, i.e., homotopic to a constant map). So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nThe identity map on X is homotopic to the constant map at a fixed point x₀ in X.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"Let the space be X and id ≃ x₀ where id is the identity map on X and x₀ is some fixed point in X.\" So they are given that X is a space where id_X is homotopic to x₀. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a topological space.\n- The identity map id_X is homotopic to the constant map x₀ (i.e., X is contractible to x₀).\n- x₀ is a fixed point in X.\n\nBut maybe the fact that id_X ≃ x₀ implies X is contractible, which is a single assumption. Wait, the problem says \"id ≃ x₀\", which is the definition of contractible. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\nX is a topological space,\nThe space X is contractible (i.e., there exists a homotopy between the identity map on X and a constant map at some point x₀ in X),\nx₀ is a fixed point in X.\n\nBut the problem says \"id ≃ x₀\", so it's given that the identity is homotopic to the constant map at x₀. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a topological space,\n- The identity map id: X → X is homotopic to the constant map at x₀,\n- x₀ is a fixed point in X.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So:\n\n1. X is a topological space. (Assumption about X's type)\n2. The identity map on X (id_X) is homotopic to the constant map at x₀. (Assumption about the homotopy of id_X)\n3. x₀ is a fixed point in X. (Assumption about x₀'s role)\n\nThen the problem is to show path connectedness between any two points a and b.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, they included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption. However, in the original problem here, the homotopy between id_X and x₀ is given, so the contractibility is an assumption. However, contractibility is a property of the space, so maybe the first assumption is that X is a contractible space. But the problem specifies the homotopy between id and x₀, so perhaps we need to list that as an assumption. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem statement: \"Let the space be X and id ≃ x₀ where id is the identity map on X and x₀ is some fixed point in X. How do I show that for any two points a,b ∈ X there is a continuous path f:[0,1] → X such that f(0) = a, f(1) = b?\"\n\nSo, in the problem, they define X as the space, and id ≃ x₀ (homotopy), with x₀ fixed. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- X is a space (topological space),\n- The identity map on X is homotopic to the constant map at x₀,\n- x₀ is a fixed point in X.\n\nBut perhaps to split into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nThe identity map id_X: X → X is homotopic to the constant map at x₀,\nx₀ is a fixed point in X.\n\nBut maybe the fact that X is a topological space is implicit, but to follow the example, maybe they included the type (like in the example, n is an integer). So perhaps include that.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer,\" which is a type. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nThe identity map id_X: X → X is homotopic to the constant map at x₀,\nx₀ is a point in X.\n\nBut the problem says \"x₀ is some fixed point in X,\" so maybe we need to note that x₀ is fixed. Wait, but \"fixed\" here probably just means chosen, not that it's a fixed point in the sense of a function. So maybe \"x₀ is a point in X\" is sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps the user's example lists \"n is an integer,\" so similarly, here:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nThe identity map on X is homotopic to the constant map at x₀,\nx₀ is a point in X.\n\nEach of these is one condition on one object. Then the problem is to show path connectedness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the homotopy between id_X and x₀ is a single assumption, but perhaps the user's format requires each line to have one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nid_X is homotopic to the constant map at x₀,\nx₀ is a point in X.\n\nBut \"id_X is homotopic to the constant map at x₀\" is a single condition about the homotopy of the identity map.\n\nSo I think this is correct. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nThe identity map id_X is homotopic to the constant map at x₀,\nx₀ is a point in X.\nProblem:\nShow that for any two points a, b ∈ X, there exists a continuous path f: [0,1] → X with f(0) = a and f(1) = b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third assumption is redundant because x₀ is part of the second assumption. But in the problem statement, they specify \"x₀ is some fixed point in X,\" so it's an explicit condition. So we need to list it as an assumption.\n\nYes, that seems right.",
