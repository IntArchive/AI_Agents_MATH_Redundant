    "Content": "I'm trying exercise 9 on page 53 in Hatcher but I need some help with it. The exercise is: In the surface $M_g$ of genus $g$, let $C$ be a circle that separates $M_g$ into two compact subsurfaces $M_h^\\prime $ and $M_k^\\prime$ obtained from the closed surfaces $M_h$ and $M_k$ by deleting an open disk from each. Show that $M_h^\\prime$ does not retract onto its boundary circle $C$, and hence $M_g$ does not retract onto $C$. [Hint: abelianize $\\pi_1$.] But show that $M_g$ does retract onto the nonseparating circle $C^\\prime$ in the figure. My first question is: assume there wasn't the hint, how would I think of abelianising? What does it mean exactly? I thought I could do this by contradiction: if it retracts the induced map $i_\\ast : \\pi_1(C) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(M_h^\\prime) $ is injective. I know $\\pi_1(C) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, then I computed $\\pi_1(M_h^\\prime) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and then I think I'm stuck. Right? Do you agree with $\\pi_1(M_h^\\prime) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and being stuck after that? What do I need to know to make progress? Many thanks for your help!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think the Wikipedia article on commutators explains the definitions and properties well. If I can clarify anything said there, let me know. It's important to note that abelianization is a covariant functor , so in particular a homomorphism of groups induces one of the abelianizations. This is a useful trick, not only because in applying $\\pi_1$ you will often produce free products that seem hard to compare with one another. For example, $\\mathbf Z * \\mathbf Z$ contains free subgroups of all finite ranks, so it isn't clear (at least to me) that we can use van Kampen to show that the wedge of two circles and the wedge of three circles have non-isomorphic $\\pi_1$s. But abelianizing makes this clear. Back to the example. I claim that for a retract $M_h' \\to C$ to exist, $i_*^\\text{ab}\\colon \\pi_1(C) \\to \\pi_1(M_h')^\\text{ab}$ would have to be injective (It does not always happen that the abelianization of an injection is injective; what's special here?). Now, $M_h'$ is the surface of genus $h$ with a hole in it, and we can represent that as So the map $i_*$ sends a generator for $\\pi_1(C)$ to a commutator $[a_1, b_1] \\cdots [a_g, b_g]$. Why does this contradict the injectivity of $i_*^\\text{ab}$? For the second part, you'll need to give a map. Here's one idea: in the above picture, ignoring the $C$, try to retract onto $a_1$. It might help to redraw this as a square with sides $a_1, b_1, a_1$, and a bunch of stuff coming off of the fourth side. The square looks a lot like the torus, and you know how to retract the torus onto a meridian (?). Note that you really can crush a bunch of stuff on the polygon together as long as you respect the identifications.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. The user is asking about an exercise from Hatcher's book regarding retractions on a genus g surface. The original problem has several parts, so I need to filter out the key assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nFirst, the title mentions that the surface of genus g does not retract to a circle, which is part of the exercise. The user's question includes details about the setup: the surface M_g is divided by a circle C into two subsurfaces M_h' and M_k', which are obtained by deleting an open disk from closed surfaces M_h and M_k respectively. The task is to show that M_h' does not retract onto C, hence M_g doesn't retract onto C. Additionally, there's a part about retracting onto a nonseparating circle C', but the user's main focus seems to be on the first part.\n\nLooking at the assumptions, I need to list each condition applied to one object. The surface M_g has genus g. The circle C separates M_g into M_h' and M_k'. Each of these subsurfaces comes from deleting an open disk from M_h and M_k, which are closed surfaces. The problem is to show that M_h' doesn't retract onto C, leading to M_g not retracting onto C. The hint mentions abelianizing the fundamental group, but the user is confused about how to approach this without the hint.\n\nThe user also mentions trying to use contradiction by assuming a retraction exists, leading to an injective induced map on fundamental groups. They computed π₁(M_h') as ℤ but got stuck. However, maybe their calculation of π₁(M_h') is incorrect. For a closed surface of genus h with a disk removed, the fundamental group should be the free group on 2h generators, not ℤ. That might be where the confusion is. So correcting that assumption would be important.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions line by line:\n\n- M_g is a surface of genus g.\n- C is a circle that separates M_g into two compact subsurfaces M_h' and M_k'.\n- M_h' is obtained from the closed surface M_h by deleting an open disk.\n- M_k' is obtained from the closed surface M_k by deleting an open disk.\n- The problem is to show that M_h' does not retract onto its boundary circle C.\n- Consequently, M_g does not retract onto C.\n\nThe problem statement should then encapsulate the main task. The user's additional questions about their approach and π₁ calculations are part of their thought process but not part of the problem's assumptions. The key problem is to prove the non-existence of the retraction as stated.",
