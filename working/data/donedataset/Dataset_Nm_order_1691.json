    "Content": "A partition of an integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of integers. The partition function $p(n)$ counts the number of distinct partitions of $n$. In 1918, Hardy and Ramanujan proved the amazing result $$p(n) \\sim \\frac {1} {4n\\sqrt3} \\exp\\left({\\pi \\sqrt {\\frac{2n}{3}}}\\right)$$ This is one of those formulae that to the uninitiated look like witchcraft. I feel a burning desire to understand why it is true, but number theory is not my forte and I don't really fancy digging up a bunch of papers a century old, even a single one of which can often take days to find. Is there a modern exposition that cuts to this result with as little groundwork as possible, or, even better, an argument that fits into a MSE answer that can at least outline how that asymptotic expression is obtained?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof of the asymptotic formula for the partition function given by Hardy and Ramanujan was \"the birth of the circle method\", and used properties of modular forms. Erdös was trying to give a proof with elementary methods (he also gave a so-called elementary proof of the PNT with Selberg). He succeeded in 1942 to give such a proof, but only with \"unknown\" constant $a$, see here . Afterwards Newman gave a \"simplified proof\", and obtained also that $a=\\frac{1}{4n\\sqrt{3}}$, see here . There are several \"modern\" references now, which give an elementary proof of the asymptotic formula for $p(n)$. Here are two references: M. B. Nathanson: On Erdös's elementary method in the asymptotic theory of partitions . Daniel M. Kane (was misspelled as \"Cane\"): An elementary derivation of the asymptotic of the partition function . Instead of using modular forms etc. the elementary method of Erdös only uses elementary estimates of exponential sums and an induction from the identity\n$$\nnp(n)=\\sum_{ka\\le n}ap(n-ka).\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question: It's about the asymptotic expression for the partition function p(n), which counts the number of distinct partitions of an integer n. Hardy and Ramanujan proved that p(n) is asymptotically equivalent to that exponential expression divided by 4n√3. The user is asking for an explanation or a modern exposition that outlines how this asymptotic is derived.\n\nNow, to format this into the given structure. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn this case, the problem is about the partition function p(n). The assumptions here would be the definitions and conditions given in the problem. Let's see:\n\nThe problem states that a partition of n is a way of writing n as a sum of integers. The partition function p(n) counts the number of distinct partitions. Then Hardy and Ramanujan proved the asymptotic formula. The user wants to understand the derivation.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. A partition of an integer n is a way of writing n as a sum of integers.\n2. The partition function p(n) counts the number of distinct partitions of n.\n3. The result by Hardy and Ramanujan is about the asymptotic behavior of p(n).\n\nBut wait, in the example, assumptions were more about conditions on the variables. Here, the problem is more about explaining the derivation of an asymptotic formula. The original problem doesn't state additional conditions beyond the definition of p(n) and the result. However, the asymptotic formula itself might have implicit assumptions, like n tending to infinity. The formula is an asymptotic expression, so n approaching infinity is an assumption.\n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The partition function p(n) counts the number of distinct partitions of n.\n- The asymptotic expression is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't explicitly mention the limit as n approaches infinity, though the ∼ symbol implies asymptotic equivalence, which is typically as n → ∞. So maybe that's an assumption.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\np(n) counts the number of distinct partitions of n,\nthe asymptotic equivalence is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$p(n) \\sim \\frac {1} {4n\\sqrt3} \\exp\\left({\\pi \\sqrt {\\frac{2n}{3}}}\\right)$$.\n\nWait, but the original problem isn't asking to prove it, but to explain why it's true, possibly outlining the derivation. However, in the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that...\". The user here is asking for an explanation or an outline of how the asymptotic expression is obtained. So the problem statement here would be the user's request, but according to the format, it's the problem to solve. Hmm.\n\nWait, the format is to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the original problem, which was to prove a divisibility, and formatted assumptions and problem. Here, the original problem is a question asking for an explanation or outline of the derivation. So how to phrase that?\n\nThe user's problem is: \"Is there a modern exposition that cuts to this result with as little groundwork as possible, or, even better, an argument that fits into a MSE answer that can at least outline how that asymptotic expression is obtained?\"\n\nBut according to the format, the \"Problem\" part should be the mathematical problem to solve. However, in this case, the question is more of a meta-request. But the example shows that the problem is the mathematical statement to prove. So perhaps the actual problem here is to derive the asymptotic formula for p(n), and the assumptions are the definition of p(n) and the conditions (like n approaching infinity).\n\nAlternatively, the problem as stated in the original post is \"Prove that p(n) ∼ ...\", but the user is asking for an explanation of why it's true, not to do the proof themselves. But the format requires structuring the problem as per the mathematical problem. So perhaps the problem part is \"Prove that p(n) ∼ ...\", with assumptions being the definition of p(n) and n approaching infinity.\n\nBut the original problem statement by the user on Math SE is not a \"prove that\" but a request for an explanation. However, the example given by the user transformed the original problem (which was to prove divisibility by 91) into the format. So in this case, perhaps the problem should be the request to outline the derivation, but the format seems to require the mathematical problem. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSimilarly, here, the mathematical problem is the asymptotic expression for p(n). So the formatted problem would be to prove the asymptotic expression, with assumptions being n is a positive integer, p(n) counts distinct partitions, and the asymptotic is as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the original question on Math SE is a request for an explanation or outline, not a direct problem. But since the task is to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example was the mathematical statement, I think the correct approach here is to take the mathematical result as the problem, and the assumptions as the definitions and conditions needed.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer,\n- p(n) is the partition function counting distinct partitions of n,\n- the asymptotic equivalence holds as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$p(n) \\sim \\frac {1} {4n\\sqrt3} \\exp\\left({\\pi \\sqrt {\\frac{2n}{3}}}\\right)$$.\n\nBut the original problem mentions that Hardy and Ramanujan proved this, so perhaps the problem is to understand or derive their result. However, the example took the original problem (which was to prove something) and structured it, so here, the problem would be the same as the example's structure, i.e., to prove the asymptotic formula.\n\nTherefore, this should be the formatted problem.",
