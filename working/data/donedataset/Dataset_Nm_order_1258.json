    "Content": "$x,y,z >0$, prove\n  $$\\frac{x^x}{x+y}+\\frac{y^y}{y+z}+\\frac{z^z}{z+x} \\geqslant \\frac32$$ I have a solution for this beautiful and elegant inequality. I am posting this inequality to share and see other solutions from everyone on MSE. Since some of you asked for my solution, I used the following estimations\n$$x^x \\geqslant \\frac12 \\left(x^2+1 \\right)$$ Proving rest of this inequality is very simple. Method 1: $$\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{x^x}{x+y} \\geqslant \\frac12\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{x^2+1}{x+y}\\geqslant \\frac12 \\left( \\frac{(x+y+z)^2}{2(x+y+z)}+\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{1}{x+y} \\right) \\geqslant \\frac12 \\sum_{cyc}\\left(\\frac{x+y}{4}+\\frac{1}{x+y} \\right) \\geqslant \\frac12 \\sum_{cyc} 2 \\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{x+y}{4}\\cdot \\frac{1}{x+y}} \\geqslant \\frac32$$ Method 2: $$\\sum_{cyc} \\frac{x^x}{x+y} \\geqslant \\frac12 \\sum_{cyc}\\frac{x^2+1}{x+y} \\geqslant \\frac32 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{(x^2+1)(y^2+1)(z^2+1)}{(x+y)(y+z)(z+x)}}\\geqslant \\frac32$$\nIt is because C-S yields $$(x^2+1)(y^2+1) \\geqslant (x+y)^2$$\nso $$\\frac{(x^2+1)(y^2+1)(z^2+1)}{(x+y)(y+z)(z+x)} \\geqslant 1$$ Method 3: Notice that\n$$\\sum_{cyc} \\frac{x^2+1}{x+y}=\\sum_{cyc} \\frac{y^2+1}{x+y}$$\nHence\n$$\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{x^x}{x+y} \\geqslant \\frac12 \\sum_{cyc}\\frac{x^2+1}{x+y}=\\frac14\\sum_{cyc} \\frac{x^2+y^2+2}{x+y} \\geqslant\\frac14\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{\\frac{(x+y)^2}{2}+2}{x+y}$$$$=\\frac14 \\sum_{cyc} \\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}+\\frac{2}{x+y} \\right) \\geqslant \\frac14 \\sum_{cyc}2 =\\frac32$$ Can you find a different solution that does not employ the estimation $x^x \\geqslant \\frac12(x^2+1)$ ? Update 1 The solution of user260822 is not correct. This is not a Nesbitt's inequality. \nWe have\n$$\\frac{x}{x+y}+\\frac{y}{y+z}+\\frac{z}{z+x} > 1 $$\n(not $\\frac32$) Update 2 Another similar question I posted a few weeks back Unconventional Inequality $ \\frac{x^x}{|x-y|}+\\frac{y^y}{|y-z|}+\\frac{z^z}{|z-x|} > \\frac72$ Please help. Thank you",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $e^x\\geq 1+x$ for all $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$, by letting $x=-\\log u$ we have that for any $u >0$, $\\log u\\geq 1-\\frac{1}{u}$, and so $u\\log u>u-1$ for any $u>0$. Combining these two inequalities, it follows that $$\\sqrt{x^x y^y}= \\exp\\left(\\frac{x\\log x}{2}+\\frac{y\\log y}{2}\\right)\\geq \\exp\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}-1\\right)\\geq   \\frac{x+y}{2}.$$ Hence $$\\frac{x^x}{x+y}+\\frac{y^y}{y+z}+\\frac{z^z}{z+x}\\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{x^x}{y^y}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{y^y}{z^z}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{z^z}{x^x}}\\right),$$ and the result follows from the AM-GM inequality. Remark: By combining $e^x\\geq 1+x$ for $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $u\\log u\\geq u-1$ for $u>0$ as above, we obtain the following \"reverse exponential AM-GM inequality\": $$\\sqrt[n]{x_{1}^{x_{1}}x_{2}^{x_{2}}\\cdots x_{n}^{x_{n}}}\\geq \\frac{x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_n}{n}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user wants to prove that for positive real numbers x, y, z, the expression (x^x)/(x+y) + (y^y)/(y+z) + (z^z)/(z+x) is greater than or equal to 3/2. They mentioned some methods they used, all of which rely on the estimation x^x ≥ 1/2(x² +1). The task is to present the problem in the specified format, listing assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The original problem states that x, y, z are positive. So each variable being positive is an assumption. However, the example given in the problem structure lists each assumption per line, applied to one object. Since x, y, z are all positive, I should list each as a separate assumption.\n\nWait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this problem, the conditions are x, y, z >0. So each variable is positive. But the user might have combined them into one assumption. Wait, the original example lists each assumption line by line, even if they apply to the same object. For example, in the example, the two assumptions are both about n: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each property is a separate line.\n\nIn the current problem, the original conditions are x, y, z >0. Since these are separate variables, each with their own condition, but actually, the problem states x, y, z >0 as a single condition. But according to the format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe split them into three separate assumptions: x is positive, y is positive, z is positive. Alternatively, if \"x, y, z >0\" is considered a single condition, but the example suggests separating each. The example had two conditions on n. Here, we have three variables each being positive, so maybe three separate assumptions.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, n is any integer, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Wait, the original example says the original problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect, because in the original problem, n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe there was a mistake in the example.\n\nBut perhaps in the original example, the user wanted to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with necessary assumptions. Wait, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, the task is to filter the problem and structure it with assumptions. So perhaps the example was trying to show that even if the original problem didn't state n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, they added that as an assumption. But that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a mistake. However, the user provided that example, so I need to follow it.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original problem states x, y, z >0. So we need to list all assumptions. The example listed each assumption line by line. So in this case, perhaps each variable's positivity is a separate assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nx is positive,\ny is positive,\nz is positive.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"x,y,z >0\", which is a single condition. But following the example, where each assumption is a separate line, even if they apply to different objects. So maybe each variable's positivity is an assumption. But perhaps in the example, the user split into different lines even for the same object. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions about n. Similarly, here, \"x is positive\", \"y is positive\", \"z is positive\" would be three separate assumptions.\n\nBut let me check the original problem's structure. The original problem is about x, y, z being positive and proving the inequality. The user's own solution uses the estimation x^x ≥ 1/2(x² +1). The problem now is to structure this according to the format. The problem mentions \"x,y,z >0\", so that's the main assumption. The problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nTherefore, under the \"Assumption\" section, each variable being positive is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\ny is a positive real number,\nz is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\frac{x^x}{x+y}+\\frac{y^y}{y+z}+\\frac{z^z}{z+x} \\geqslant \\frac32.$$\n\nI need to make sure that there are no other assumptions. The original problem doesn't state any other conditions, just x, y, z >0. The user's methods and other discussions are about different approaches, but the core problem remains with those assumptions. So the formatted problem should include those three assumptions, each on a separate line.",
