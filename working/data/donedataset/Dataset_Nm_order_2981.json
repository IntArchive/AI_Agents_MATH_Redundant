    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $g(t):=\\left(\\dfrac{1}{1+\\exp(t)}\\right)^3$ for $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$ .  Then, $$g''(t)=\\frac{3\\,\\exp(t)\\,\\big(3\\,\\exp(t)-1\\big)}{\\big(1+\\exp(t)\\big)^5}\\text{ for each }t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,.$$ Thus, $g$ is convex on $\\big[-\\ln(3),\\infty\\big)$ . Let $x:=\\dfrac{b}{a}$ , $y:=\\dfrac{c}{b}$ , and $z:=\\dfrac{a}{c}$ be as the OP defines.  Then, the required inequality is equivalent to $$g\\big(\\ln(x)\\big)+g\\big(\\ln(y)\\big)+g\\big(\\ln(z)\\big)\\geq \\dfrac{3}{8}\\,.\\tag{*}$$ If $x$ , $y$ , or $z$ is less than $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ , then clearly the left-hand side of (*) is greater than $$\\left(\\dfrac{1}{1+\\frac13}\\right)^3=\\frac{27}{64}>\\frac38\\,.$$ If all $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ are greater than or equal to $\\dfrac13$ , then $\\ln(x),\\ln(y),\\ln(z)\\geq -\\ln(3)$ , so that we can use convexity of $g$ on $\\big[-\\ln(3),\\infty\\big)$ .  By Jensen's Inequality, $$g\\big(\\ln(x)\\big)+g\\big(\\ln(y)\\big)+g\\big(\\ln(z)\\big)\\geq3\\,g\\left(\\frac{\\ln(x)+\\ln(y)+\\ln(z)}{3}\\right)=3\\,g(0)=\\frac{3}{8}\\,.$$ Hence, the equality holds if and only if $x=y=z=1$ , making $a=b=c$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure their Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving an inequality involving three positive real numbers a, b, c. The problem is to show that the sum of (a/(a+b))^3 + (b/(b+c))^3 + (c/(c+a))^3 is at least 3/8.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given shows that each assumption is a single property applied to one object. In the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, the variables a, b, c are each positive real numbers. Since each assumption is one property per line, I need to list each variable's condition separately.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"Let a, b, c be positive real numbers.\" So the assumptions are that a, b, c are each positive real numbers. Therefore, each should be a separate line in the assumption section.\n\nThe problem itself is to prove that the sum of those three fractions cubed is at least 3/8. The user also mentions an attempted substitution using x = b/a, y = c/b, z = a/c, leading to xyz = 1. But in the formatted problem, we shouldn't include the user's attempts or thoughts, just the original problem's assumptions and statement. So the substitution and the following steps are part of the user's attempt, which we need to filter out as per the instructions.\n\nSo the key points are:\n\nAssumptions:\n- a is a positive real number\n- b is a positive real number\n- c is a positive real number\n\nProblem: Prove that [(a/(a+b))^3 + (b/(b+c))^3 + (c/(c+a))^3] ≥ 3/8.\n\nI should check if there are any other assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention any restrictions beyond a, b, c being positive reals. So the three assumptions are each variable being positive real. Then the problem is as stated.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they split into two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the example provided by the user, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. Maybe the assumption that n is divisible by 7 was a mistake? Wait, looking back: the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems inconsistent. Maybe that was an error in the example? Because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be incorrect. Hmm. Perhaps that example had a mistake, but the user provided it as their own example. So maybe the user wants me to follow their example's structure, even if the example is wrong. But in the current problem, there's no such additional condition. The variables a, b, c are just positive real numbers, so each is listed as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have three assumptions, each stating that a, b, c are positive real numbers, each on their own line. Then the problem is to prove the inequality.",
