    "Content": "The following question is problem Pinter's Abstract Algebra . And to put things in context: $G$ is a group and $a, b$ are elements of $G$. I want to show $(ab)^{-1}$ = $b^{-1}a^{-1}$. I originally thought of proving the fact in the following manner:\n\\begin{align*}\n(ab)^{-1}(ab) &= e \\newline\n(ab)^{-1}(ab)(b^{-1}) &= (e)(b^{-1}) \\newline\n(ab)^{-1}(a)(bb^{-1}) &= (b^{-1}) \\newline\n(ab)^{-1}(a)(e) &= (b^{-1}) \\newline\n(ab)^{-1}(a) &= (b^{-1}) \\newline\n(ab)^{-1}(a)(a^{-1}) &= (b^{-1})(a^{-1}) \\newline\n(ab)^{-1}(e) &= (b^{-1})(a^{-1}) \\newline\n(ab)^{-1} &= (b^{-1})(a^{-1}) \\newline\n\\end{align*} I know this may seem extremely inefficient to most, and I know there is a shorter way. But would this be considered a legitimate proof? Thanks in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your way is absolutely fine.  As you note, there is in fact an easier way.  It would be enough to show that the element $c$ such that $(ab)c = e$ is in fact $c = b^{-1} a^{-1}$: $$\\begin{align}\n(ab)b^{-1} a^{-1} &= a (b b^{-1}) a^{-1}\n\\\\\n&= a e a^{-1}\n\\\\\n&= a a^{-1}\n\\\\\n&= e.\n\\end{align}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the inverse of the product of two elements in a group is the product of their inverses in reverse order. The user provided their proof step by step and is asking if it's valid.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem is set in the context of group theory. So, the key assumptions here would relate to the properties of a group and the elements involved. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The problem mentions that G is a group. So, the first assumption is that G is a group. Groups have closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses for each element.\n\n2. The elements a and b are elements of G. So, the second assumption is that a and b are elements of G.\n\n3. The user is trying to show that (ab)^{-1} equals b^{-1}a^{-1}. The proof uses group axioms like the existence of inverses and the identity element. However, the assumptions shouldn't include what needs to be proven; they should only state the given conditions.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify any additional conditions on a and b beyond being elements of G. So the assumptions are just that G is a group and a, b are in G. The problem is to prove the inverse of their product is the product of inverses in reverse order.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions listed were about the properties of n. Similarly here, the assumptions are about G being a group and a, b being elements in G. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\na is an element of G,\nb is an element of G.\n\nProblem: Prove that (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}.\n\nI think that's it. The user's proof steps are part of their attempt, but the structured problem needs to present the core assumptions and the problem statement without the proof attempt. The original question had some extra context about the book and the user's thought process, but we need to filter that out.",
