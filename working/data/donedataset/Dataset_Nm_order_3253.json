    "Content": "Let $p\\in(0,1)$. The inequality $4p(1-p)\\leq 1$ is very easy and elementary,\nbut I wonder if there is a probabilistic proof of it. By that, I mean constructing\na “natural” probability space and an event in it with probability $4p(1-p)$. This is easy to do if $4p(1-p)$ is replaced by $3p(1-p)$ : consider\nthree i.i.d. variables $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ with Bernoulli distribution\n${\\cal B}(p)$, and consider the event “The $X_i$ are not all equal”. Update : One thing that makes this problem hard is that there is no “discrete,finite” solution, involving only a set of $n$ i.i.d. variables $X_1,X_2,X_3,\\ldots,X_n$ with Bernoulli distribution ${\\cal B}(p)$ (this is because the inequality becomes an equality exactly when $p=\\frac{1}{2}$).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A (possibly unsatisfying) solution: Let X  be a binomial random variable with 2 trials and probability of success $|1-2p|$. Then the probability that $X \\neq 2$ is $1-|1-2p|^2 = 1 - (1 - 4p + 4p^2) = 4p - 4p^2 = 4p(1-p)$. In terms of your example, let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be i.i.d. Bernoulli variables with probability $|1-2p|$. Then $4p(1-p)$ is the probability that the two $X_i$ are not both 1.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is asking if there's a probabilistic proof for the inequality 4p(1-p) ≤ 1 where p is a probability. The question elaborates that they want a \"natural\" probability space and an event with probability 4p(1-p). They mention that replacing 4p(1-p) with 3p(1-p) is easier using three i.i.d. Bernoulli variables and the event that not all are equal. The update notes the difficulty because there's no discrete, finite solution since equality occurs at p=1/2.\n\nSo the main problem is to prove the inequality using a probabilistic approach. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91. The assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line, each about one condition.\n\nApplying that here, the problem is about p being a probability, so first assumption is that p is in the interval (0,1). Then, the inequality 4p(1-p) ≤ 1 needs to be proven using a probabilistic proof, specifically constructing a probability space and event with that probability. The problem mentions that it's easy for 3p(1-p) using three Bernoulli variables. But the user's update states that a discrete finite solution isn't possible because equality at p=1/2. However, that part might be part of the problem's context rather than an assumption. \n\nWait, the assumptions should be the given conditions. The problem says \"Let p∈(0,1)\". So that's one assumption. Then, the requirement is to find a probabilistic proof. But the problem structure example only includes the given conditions in the assumptions. The problem part is the actual question.\n\nSo in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a probability, so p ∈ (0,1).\n\nBut the problem is to prove the inequality using a probabilistic method, i.e., constructing a probability space and an event with probability 4p(1-p). The user also mentions that replacing 4 with 3 is easier with three Bernoulli variables. However, the update is additional context but maybe not part of the assumptions. \n\nSo the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. The problem is asking for a proof, so the assumptions are the premises. Therefore, the assumption here is that p is a probability in (0,1). The problem is to prove 4p(1-p) ≤1 using a probabilistic proof (constructing the probability space and event). \n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, and another that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem included n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. So perhaps the example had an error or additional assumption? Wait, the original example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should be n is an integer, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. But regardless, the task is to follow the format as per the example, even if there's an error. \n\nIn the current problem, the original question states \"Let p ∈ (0,1). The inequality 4p(1-p) ≤ 1 is very easy and elementary, but I wonder if there is a probabilistic proof of it.\" So the assumptions here are p is in (0,1). The problem is to provide a probabilistic proof of the inequality. However, the problem might need to structure the problem part as per the example, which included the specific expression. \n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\np is a probability (i.e., p ∈ (0,1)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that 4p(1-p) ≤ 1 using a probabilistic proof by constructing a \"natural\" probability space and an event within it with probability 4p(1-p).\n\nWait, but the original question mentions constructing a natural probability space and an event with probability 4p(1-p). So the problem is to both construct such a space/event and thereby prove the inequality. Therefore, the problem part would be to construct that and show the inequality.\n\nBut the example's problem part was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem is to \"Prove that 4p(1-p) ≤ 1 for a probability p using a probabilistic proof (constructing a natural probability space and an event with probability 4p(1-p)).\"\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be phrased as: \"Construct a natural probability space and an event with probability 4p(1-p), thereby proving the inequality 4p(1-p) ≤ 1 for a probability p.\"\n\nBut the example's problem part just stated the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps the problem here should be \"Prove that 4p(1-p) ≤ 1 for a probability p using a probabilistic proof (i.e., by constructing a natural probability space and an event with probability 4p(1-p)).\"\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Is there a probabilistic proof of the inequality 4p(1-p) ≤ 1 for a probability p?\" So the problem is asking for existence of such a proof via constructing the probability space and event.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a probability (p ∈ (0,1))\n\nProblem: Prove that 4p(1-p) ≤ 1 using a probabilistic proof by constructing a natural probability space and an event with probability 4p(1-p).\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions listed as separate lines. So \"p is a probability (p ∈ (0,1))\" as one assumption. Then maybe another assumption? Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Which might be incorrect. But perhaps in the current problem, the only assumption is that p is a probability. So:\n\nAssumption:\np is a probability (i.e., p ∈ (0,1)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the inequality $4p(1-p) \\leq 1$ holds using a probabilistic proof by constructing a \"natural\" probability space and an event within it with probability $4p(1-p)$.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem part is just the inequality, and the method (probabilistic proof) is part of the problem statement. So the problem is to prove the inequality via that method.\n\nYes, so the assumptions are p is a probability, and the problem is to construct the probability space and event to prove the inequality. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\np is a probability (i.e., p ∈ (0,1)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $4p(1-p) \\leq 1$ using a probabilistic proof by constructing a \"natural\" probability space and an event with probability $4p(1-p)$.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. Each assumption is one line, here only one assumption. The problem is the rest.",
