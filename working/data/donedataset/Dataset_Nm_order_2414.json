    "Content": "Let $z_0$ be a non-removable isolated singularity of $f$. Show that $z_0$ is then an essential singularity of $\\exp(f)$. Hello, unfortunately I do not know how to proof that. To my opinion one has to consider two cases: $z_0$ is a pole of order $k$ of $f$. $z_0$ is an essential singularity of $f$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We can also look at it from the other side. If $z_0$ is a removable singularity of $e^f$, then $\\lvert e^{f(z)}\\rvert < K$ in some punctured neighbourhood of $z_0$. Since $\\lvert e^w\\rvert = e^{\\operatorname{Re} w}$, that means $\\operatorname{Re} f(z) < K'\\; (= \\log K)$ in a punctured neighbourhood $\\dot{D}_\\varepsilon(z_0)$ of $z_0$, and that implies that $z_0$ is a removable singularity of $f$. (Were it a pole, $f(\\dot{D}_\\varepsilon(z_0))$ would contain the complement of some disk $D_r(0)$; were it an essential singularity, each $f(\\dot{D}_\\varepsilon(z_0))$ would be dense in $\\mathbb{C}$ by Casorati-Weierstraß; in both cases $\\operatorname{Re} f(z)$ is unbounded on $\\dot{D}_\\varepsilon(z_0)$.) If $z_0$ were a pole of $e^f$, it would be a removable singularity of $e^{-f}$, hence $z_0$ would be a removable singularity of $-f$ by the above, hence $z_0$ would be a removable singularity of $f$, and therefore a removable singularity of $e^f$ - contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given question according to the specified example. The original problem is about complex analysis, specifically singularities. \n\nFirst, the title of the question is: \"$z_0$ non-removable singularity of $f\\Rightarrow z_0$ essential singularity of $\\exp(f)$\". The user then provides the problem statement in the question body. Let me parse that.\n\nThe user mentions that they need to show that if $z_0$ is a non-removable isolated singularity of $f$, then $z_0$ is an essential singularity of $\\exp(f)$. They also mention considering two cases: when $z_0$ is a pole of order $k$ and when it's an essential singularity of $f$. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, let's extract the assumptions from the problem. \n\nThe problem states that $z_0$ is a non-removable isolated singularity of $f$. Non-removable singularities in complex analysis are either poles or essential singularities. So, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. $z_0$ is an isolated singularity of $f$.\n2. $z_0$ is a non-removable singularity of $f$.\n\nThese are two separate assumptions. The first addresses that the singularity is isolated, and the second that it's non-removable. Each applies to the object $z_0$ in the context of the function $f$.\n\nThe problem then asks to show that $z_0$ is an essential singularity of $\\exp(f)$. So the problem statement is clear: Prove that $z_0$ is an essential singularity of $\\exp(f)$.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original problem mentions considering two cases (pole and essential singularity of $f$), but those are not assumptions but rather cases to be considered in the proof. The assumptions given in the problem are just about $z_0$ being a non-removable isolated singularity of $f$.\n\nTherefore, structuring it as per the example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $z_0$ is an isolated singularity of $f$.\n- $z_0$ is a non-removable singularity of $f$.\n\nProblem: Show that $z_0$ is an essential singularity of $\\exp(f)$.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The first line is about being an isolated singularity, the second about being non-removable. Both apply to $z_0$ for the function $f$. The problem is to show the consequence for $\\exp(f)$.\n\nI think that's accurate. The example given in the prompt had two assumptions as well, one about $n$ being integer, another about divisibility by 7. Similarly, here two separate properties of the singularity are listed as assumptions.",
