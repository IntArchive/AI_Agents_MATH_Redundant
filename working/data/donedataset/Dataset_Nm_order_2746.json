    "Content": "Possible Duplicate: Proof that a natural number multiplied by some integer results in a number with only one and zero as digits I read this somewhere recently: For any natural number $n$ , there exists a multiple of $n$ , such that the multiple has only 0 and 1 as its digits. $2 \\to 10$ $3 \\to 111$ $4 \\to 100$ $5 \\to 10$ $6 \\to 1110$ $7 \\to 1001$ Any ideas how to go about proving this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the numbers $a_1=1$, $a_2=11$, $a_3=111$, and so on. Let  $r_1, r_2,r_3,$ and so on be the remainders when the $a_i$ are divided by $n$. There are at most $n$ conceivable such remainders. So there must be two numbers $a_i$, $a_j$ such that $i\\lt j$ and $r_i=r_j$.  Their difference $a_j-a_i$ is divisible by $n$, and has only $0$'s and/or $1$'s. Moreover, all the $1$'s precede all the $0$'s.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's requirements. The task is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, let's read the original problem carefully. The title is \"Existence of multiple of n with only 0 and 1 as its digits.\" The user mentions a possible duplicate and then states the problem: For any natural number n, there exists a multiple of n such that the multiple has only 0 and 1 as its digits. Examples are given for n=2 to 7.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"for any natural number n,\" so the first assumption is that n is a natural number. The problem is about finding a multiple of n that consists solely of the digits 0 and 1. However, in the assumptions, we should only list conditions given, not what needs to be proven. Wait, the problem is to prove that such a multiple exists. So the assumptions would be the given conditions on n. The only given condition here is that n is a natural number. The rest is what needs to be proven.\n\nWait, the example provided in the user's instruction had an original problem where the assumption included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" But in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. However, the formatted problem listed \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be because in the original problem, the user had a mistake or perhaps the problem was modified. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example, or perhaps the original problem had an error. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example was actually requiring n to be divisible by 7, but it was written as \"for every integer n.\" That might be an error in the original problem, and the formatted version corrects it by adding the assumption. Or maybe the user is showing that sometimes assumptions need to be clarified.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking about the existence of a multiple with 0s and 1s for any natural number n. The only assumption here is that n is a natural number. There are no additional restrictions given in the problem. The examples provided (like 2→10, 3→111, etc.) just illustrate the claim for specific n, but they don't add conditions. Therefore, the assumption here is simply that n is a natural number. The problem is to prove that such a multiple exists.\n\nSo, following the format, the assumptions section should list each condition on the objects involved. In this case, the object is n, and the condition is that n is a natural number. There's only one assumption here. Then the problem statement is to prove that there exists a multiple of n consisting only of digits 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but the original question says \"For any natural number n, there exists a multiple of n such that...\" So the problem is a universal statement: for all n in natural numbers, there exists a multiple... Therefore, the assumption is that n is a natural number, and the problem is to show the existence of such a multiple.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a multiple of n with only 0 and 1 as its digits.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the user's instruction included multiple assumptions, each as a separate line. In this case, there's only one assumption. Let me check the original problem again. The original problem says \"For any natural number n,\" so the only assumption is that n is a natural number. There are no other conditions given. Therefore, the assumptions list should have only one item: n is a natural number.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I think that's the correct formatting here.",
