    "AcceptedAnswer": "In general, let $$\\alpha = \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt[n]{a_n}$$ for the sequence $\\{ a_n \\}$ of non-negative real numbers such that not every term is equal to zero. Then we have $$ \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt[n]{a_1 + \\cdots + a_n} = \\max \\{ \\alpha, 1 \\}. $$ Proof using elementary analysis. Case 1. Assume $\\alpha \\geq 1$. On the one hand, we have $$ \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k \\right)^{1/n} \\geq \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt[n]{a_n} = \\alpha. $$ Thus if $\\alpha = \\infty$, then this automatically implies the assertion. This shows that we assume without losing the generality that $\\alpha < \\infty$. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that $a_n \\leq (\\alpha + \\epsilon)^{n}$ for all $n \\geq N$. Since $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k \\right) +  (\\alpha + \\epsilon)^{N+1} \\cdot \\frac{(\\alpha + \\epsilon)^{n-N} - 1}{(\\alpha + \\epsilon) - 1} $$ and $\\alpha + \\epsilon > 1$, it follows that $$ \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k \\right)^{1/n} \\leq \\alpha + \\epsilon. $$ As this is true for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we have $$ \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k \\right)^{1/n} \\leq \\alpha. $$ This complete s the proof for the case $\\alpha \\geq 1$. Case 2. Assume $\\alpha < 1$. Then for some $\\alpha < \\beta < 1$, there exists $C > 0$ such that $a_n \\leq C \\beta^{n}$ for all $n$. This shows that $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^{n} C \\beta^{k} \\leq \\frac{C\\beta}{1-\\beta} < \\infty. $$ On the other hand, since $a_n > 0$ for some $n$, it follows that $$ 0 < C' \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k $$ for some $C' > 0$ for sufficiently large $n$. This shows that $$ \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt[n]{a_1 + \\cdots + a_n} = 1. $$ Proof using complex analysis. Let $$ f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n $$ and $R$ be the radius of convergence of this series. Then we have $$ \\frac{1}{R} = \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt[n]{a_n} = \\alpha,$$ where we adopt the convention that $1/\\infty = 0$ and $1/0 = \\infty$. But since $$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k \\right) z^{n} = \\frac{f(z)}{1-z} $$ has the radius of convergence as $\\min \\{R, 1 \\}$ because of the singularity at $z = 1$, it follows that $$ \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt[n]{a_1 + \\cdots + a_n} = \\frac{1}{\\min \\{1, R \\}} = \\max \\{1, \\alpha \\}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given mathematics question according to a specific format. The original problem is about showing that the limit superior of the nth root of the sum of a sequence equals 1, given that the limit superior of the nth root of the individual terms is also 1. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question carefully. The question states: Let {a_n} be a positive sequence with lim sup_{n→∞} √[n]{a_n} = 1. Show that lim sup_{n→∞} √[n]{a₁ + a₂ + ... + a_n} = 1. The user is also unsure if the problem is true and asks for a counterexample if it's false.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely.\n\nAssumptions here are:\n1. {a_n} is a sequence of positive numbers. So each term a_n is positive.\n2. The lim sup of the nth root of a_n as n approaches infinity is 1.\n\nThe problem is to show that under these conditions, the lim sup of the nth root of the sum of the first n terms is also 1. Alternatively, if this isn't true, find a counterexample.\n\nWait, but the original problem includes the user's uncertainty and the request for a counterexample. However, in the example given, the problem part was just the statement to prove. So perhaps the counterexample part should be part of the problem statement as well. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included the assumptions and the problem statement. The user's doubts and additional questions weren't included in the formatted problem. But in this case, the original question includes both the request to show the lim sup equality and the query about its validity and possible counterexamples. However, the format example seems to focus on the problem to solve, not the meta-questions. The user's example didn't include the \"I am not sure...\" part in the formatted problem. So maybe I should exclude the user's uncertainty and only present the problem as stated, even though the original question includes the doubt. Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to structure the problem as per the initial mathematical question, not the user's doubts. The example given by the user took the original problem, filtered out unrelated info, and listed assumptions. The user's own uncertainty might be considered as part of the problem's context but not part of the problem itself. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we should present the mathematical question as it is, with assumptions and the problem statement. So the problem part here would be: Show that lim sup ... =1. Then, if the problem is false, provide a counterexample. Wait, but the original question combines both parts: the request to show the equality and the query about its validity. So perhaps the problem statement should include both: \"Show that ... If it is false, provide a counterexample.\" But in the example, the problem was just the statement to prove. However, in the example, the original problem was to prove something, and the formatted version included that. Here, the original problem is a question, not just a statement. Therefore, maybe the problem part should include both: the user wants to show the equality or find a counterexample. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the given format. The example shows that even if the original problem had some conditions (like n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original), but in reality, the user might have included wrong assumptions. Wait, no, looking at the example: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7; it's for every integer n. So the example seems to have an error. Wait, perhaps the user provided an example that was incorrect, but we are supposed to follow the format regardless. Hmm, this is confusing. But given that the user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, perhaps the example is illustrative of the format, not of correctness. So in this case, regardless of the original problem's content, the task is to list all the assumptions from the problem, each as a single line, and then state the problem.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nOriginal problem: Let {a_n} be a positive sequence with lim sup_{n→∞} √[n]{a_n} =1. Show that lim sup_{n→∞} √[n]{a₁ + ... +a_n} =1. The user is unsure if it's true and asks for a counterexample if false.\n\nAssumptions should be:\n\n1. {a_n} is a sequence of positive numbers.\n2. The limit superior as n approaches infinity of the nth root of a_n is 1.\n\nProblem: Show that the limit superior as n approaches infinity of the nth root of the sum a₁ + ... +a_n is 1. If it is false, provide a counterexample.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction included assumptions that might not all be explicit. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption on n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That suggests that maybe the example is wrong, but we need to follow the instruction regardless. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but we should focus on the current problem.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the assumptions are as above. The problem is to show the lim sup equality or provide a counterexample if false. But in the example, the problem part was just the statement to prove. However, in the current case, the original question is phrased as a question (how to show X, and if false, counterexample), so we need to include both as the problem statement.\n\nHence, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\n{a_n} is a sequence of positive numbers,\nThe limit superior of √[n]{a_n} as n approaches infinity is 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\varlimsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\sqrt[n]{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}}=1 $$. If it is false, provide a counterexample.\n\nBut perhaps the counterexample request is part of the problem, so the problem includes both. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only to show the equality, and the counterexample is a separate part. But given the user's original question includes both, we should include both in the problem statement.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n{aₙ} is a sequence of positive numbers,\n$\\displaystyle \\varlimsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\sqrt[n]{a_{n}}}=1$.\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\varlimsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\sqrt[n]{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}}=1 $$.
