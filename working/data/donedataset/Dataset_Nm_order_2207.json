    "Content": "This question is based on a homework exercise: \"Let $m$ be a negative, square-free integer with at least two prime factors. Show that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{m}]$ is not a PID .\" In an aside comment in the book we're using (Milne), it was noted that a lot was known about quadratic extension with $m$ negative, but very little with $m$ positive. Why is this? I have not solved the exercise, mainly because I can't think of a propery of negative numbers that positive numbers don't possess ($|m|\\neq m$, but that's trivial). It seem there should be some relatively straightforward way to calculate class numbers for quadratic extensions with $m$ negative and composite. Or maybe the way to do this is to produce an ideal that is not principal - but then again I must find this property of negative numbers that separates them from positive.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint $\\ $ Consider factorizations like $\\rm\\ \\ \\sqrt{-pq}\\ \\sqrt{-pq}\\ =\\: -p\\:q\\ $ Note too $\\rm\\ p\\ |\\ d\\ \\Rightarrow\\ (p,\\:\\sqrt{d})^2\\ =\\ p\\ (p,d/p,\\sqrt{d})\\ =\\ (p)\\ $ since $\\rm\\:d\\:$ squarefree $\\rm \\Rightarrow\\ (p,d/p) = 1\\:$. More generally, one can show that a quadratic number ring is a PID (or investigate its class group structure) by analysing the splitting or ramification of rational primes below the Minkowski bound. For example, this explains Euler's famous prime-producing polynomials. One explanation as to why this is simpler for complex vs. real quadratic number fields has to do with the fact that norms reflect much of the multiplicative structure, and complex quadratic fields have simpler norms, being positive definite vs. indefinite sign for real quadratic fields.  Thus, in the first example I mention above, it is very simple to show that $\\rm\\ \\sqrt{-pq}\\ $ is irreducible since otherwise $\\rm\\ r\\ |\\ \\sqrt{-pq}\\ \\Rightarrow\\ rr'\\ |\\ pq\\ $ in $\\mathbb Z\\:,\\:$ so $\\rm\\ rr' = p\\:$ or $\\rm\\:q\\:,\\:$ contra $\\rm\\ r\\:r' = m^2 + pq\\ n^2\\ $ takes only square values below $\\rm\\:pq\\ (\\Rightarrow n = 0)\\:$. Notice how this proof depends crucially on the positivity of the norm form. In a real field we have instead $\\rm\\ rr' = m^2 - pq\\:n^2\\ $ which, having indefinite sign, thwarts the proof, e.g. in $\\rm\\ \\mathbb Z[\\sqrt 14]\\ $ we have $\\rm\\ 2 = N(4 + \\sqrt{14}),\\,\\ {-}7 = N(7 + 2\\ \\sqrt{14})\\:,\\:$ where $\\rm\\:N\\:$ is the norm. In fact non-UFD number rings are characterized by this property, viz. $\\rm\\ \\sqrt{-pq}\\ $ being irreducible but having norm splitting into two or more primes. Indeed, it's not difficult to show that a number ring is a UFD iff its irreducibles have prime power norms, i.e. exactly one rational prime $\\rm\\:p\\:$ occurs in norms of irreducible elements $\\rm\\ N(\\pi) = p^n\\:.\\:$ More generally one can show that in many favorable contexts (e.g. Galois) that a number ring enjoys unique factorization iff its monoid of norms does. For references (Bumby and Dade, Lettl, Coykendall) see my sci.math post on 19 Dec 2007.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about why negative numbers m are special in the context of quadratic extensions Z[√m], particularly regarding the property that Z[√m] is not a PID when m is negative, square-free, and has at least two prime factors. The user also mentions that Milne's book notes more is known about negative m in quadratic extensions compared to positive m.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The exercise states: \"Let m be a negative, square-free integer with at least two prime factors. Show that Z[√m] is not a PID.\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. m is a negative integer.\n2. m is square-free.\n3. m has at least two prime factors.\n\nThese are the key conditions given for m. The problem part would then be to show that under these assumptions, Z[√m] is not a PID.\n\nAdditionally, the user's broader question is why negative m are studied more in this context compared to positive m, but the formatting example seems to focus on the specific problem from the exercise. So maybe the main problem to structure here is the one from the homework, and the rest is context.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property of a single object. In the example, n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line.\n\nApplying that to the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- m is a negative integer.\n- m is square-free.\n- m has at least two prime factors.\n\nProblem: Show that ℤ[√m] is not a principal ideal domain.\n\nThat seems to fit. The other parts of the original question, like why more is known about negative m, might be part of the user's broader inquiry but the exercise itself is the core problem here. The user also mentions trying to find a property of negative numbers that separates them from positive in this context, but the structured problem should focus on the specific exercise as per the example.\n\nSo I think the formatted problem should list those three assumptions and then state the problem as showing Z[√m] is not a PID. The other parts of the user's question are additional context but not part of the structured problem format requested, which requires filtering unrelated information.",
