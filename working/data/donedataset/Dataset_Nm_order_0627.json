    "Content": "I get the graphic explanation, i.e. that the area $dA$ of the sector's increment can be looked upon as a polar \"rectangle\" as $dr$ and $d\\theta$ are infinitesimal, but how do you prove this rigorously? 1. Geometrically, the exact area would be $$\\frac{(r+dr)^2d\\theta}{2} - \\frac{r^2d\\theta}{2}$$$$= (r + \\frac{dr}{2}) dr d\\theta  $$$$= r dr d\\theta + \\frac{dr^2 d\\theta}{2}.$$ How do we get rid of $\\frac{dr^2 d\\theta}{2}$? Is it too insignificant in value compared to $r dr d\\theta$ so that it vanishes? If so, is it the reason it gets ignored? And what's more, geometrically speaking, why would the two areas - $dx dy$ and $r dr d\\theta$, be equal? 2. Approaching it algebraically, setting $$x = r\\sin\\theta$$$$y = r \\cos\\theta$$ gives $$\\frac{dx}{d\\theta} = r\\cos\\theta,  dx = r\\cos{\\theta} d\\theta$$$$ \\frac{dy}{dr} = \\cos\\theta,  dy = \\cos\\theta dr. $$ Multiplying both equations, side by side, gives $$dxdy = r\\cos^2\\theta dr d\\theta.$$ Again I get an extra term, which is $\\cos^2 \\theta$. In both cases I am unable to derive that $dxdy = rdrd\\theta$. What do I do wrong in my reasoning? It all makes me think that I'm getting something essential terribly wrong.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In the geometric approach, $dr^2=0$ as it is not only small but also symmetric (see here ). In the algebraic, more rigorous approach, you are deriving $x$ by $\\theta$ and $y$ by $r$, but you are forgetting the cross terms! These are function of two variables each, so you should do all partial derivatives: $$\ndx=\\dfrac{\\partial x}{\\partial r}dr+\\dfrac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta\n$$\n$$\ndy=\\dfrac{\\partial y}{\\partial r}dr+\\dfrac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta\\;.\n$$ Deriving (you did already two of them, here we do all four):\n$$\ndx=\\sin\\theta\\,dr+r\\,\\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta\n$$\n$$\ndy=\\cos\\theta\\,dr-r\\,\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta\\;.\n$$\nThe exterior product of these two vectors (see link above, or think of the cross product, or think of the area of the parallelogram) is:\n$$\ndx \\, dy = (\\sin\\theta\\,dr)(-r\\,\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta)-(\\cos\\theta\\,dr)(\\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n= -r(\\sin^2\\theta +\\cos^2\\theta)\\,dr\\,d\\theta=-r\\,dr\\,d\\theta.\n$$\nUsually one takes instead $x=\\cos\\theta,y=\\sin\\theta$, so that the minus sign becomes a plus. But anyway, what matters is the absolute value of that thing. I think that what you were missing is the link between area (and more generally volumes) and exterior product. Look it up starting from the link above, it's very interesting.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem based on the user's instructions. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original question. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object.\n\nLooking at the problem, the main goal is to rigorously prove that dx dy = r dr dθ. The user mentions two approaches: geometric and algebraic. Let me parse through each part to extract the assumptions.\n\nIn the geometric approach, the user calculates the area of a polar sector increment as (r + dr/2) dr dθ and questions why the term (dr² dθ)/2 is ignored. The assumption here seems to be that dr and dθ are infinitesimally small, making higher-order terms like dr² negligible. So one assumption is that dr and dθ are infinitesimals.\n\nIn the algebraic approach, the user sets x = r sinθ and y = r cosθ. Then they compute the differentials dx and dy by taking partial derivatives. However, they only consider ∂x/∂θ and ∂y/∂r, which is incorrect because when changing variables from (x, y) to (r, θ), the correct approach involves the Jacobian determinant. The user's mistake here is not considering all partial derivatives, which leads them to an incorrect result. But the assumption here is that the coordinate transformation is given by x = r sinθ and y = r cosθ.\n\nWait, but the user actually used x = r sinθ and y = r cosθ. Wait, no, typically in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Let me check the original problem. The user wrote: \"x = r sinθ\", \"y = r cosθ\". Hmm, that's swapped from the standard. Usually, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Maybe that's a mistake, but in the problem, the user defines x and y that way. So perhaps the problem's assumption is that x = r sinθ and y = r cosθ, even though that's non-standard. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, but since the problem is as stated, I need to take their definitions as given. However, this might be part of the problem, but the user is asking why their approach isn't working. So the coordinate transformation is as they defined: x = r sinθ, y = r cosθ. Therefore, the assumption here is the coordinate transformation equations provided by the user.\n\nAnother assumption is that they are trying to compute the area element dx dy in terms of dr and dθ. So the problem is about changing variables from Cartesian to polar coordinates. The user attempted to compute differentials by taking partial derivatives but missed the cross terms. For example, dx depends on both dr and dθ, not just dθ. Similarly, dy depends on both dr and dθ. Therefore, the user didn't account for all partial derivatives, leading to an incorrect Jacobian. However, in their algebraic approach, they only took ∂x/∂θ and ∂y/∂r, which is incomplete. Therefore, the mistake is not considering all partial derivatives when computing the Jacobian determinant. But as assumptions, the problem relies on the coordinate transformation given and the use of differentials.\n\nPutting this together, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. The coordinate transformation is defined as x = r sinθ and y = r cosθ.\n2. dr and dθ are infinitesimal quantities.\n3. The area element dx dy is transformed using differentials of x and y in terms of dr and dθ.\n\nBut wait, the user's problem is why their methods aren't leading to the correct result. So the assumptions they are working under include their own approach. However, according to the example given, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the problem as stated in the example didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the assumption is that n is an integer, but in the example, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe there was a mistake. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the example was incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated info. Wait, maybe the original problem had more context, but in the example, the user restructured it. Hmm. But in this current problem, the task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into assumptions and the problem.\n\nSo, for the current problem:\n\nTitle: Rigorous proof that dx dy=r dr dθ\n\nQuestion: The user is asking for a rigorous proof, mentions geometric interpretation with infinitesimals, and algebraic approach with coordinate transformation. Their problem is that in both approaches, they get extra terms (the dr² dθ/2 term and the cos²θ term) and can't derive dx dy = r dr dθ. So the assumptions here would be the mathematical context they're working in.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list the mathematical conditions given or used in the problem. For example:\n\nAssumption: The area element in Cartesian coordinates is dx dy.\nAssumption: The coordinate transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates is x = r sinθ, y = r cosθ.\nAssumption: dr and dθ are infinitesimally small.\nAssumption: Higher-order infinitesimals (like dr² dθ) can be neglected.\n\nBut wait, the user is questioning why the higher-order term is ignored. So that might not be an assumption but part of their confusion. The problem is whether neglecting higher-order terms is valid. However, in the context of differentials, when taking limits as dr and dθ approach zero, higher-order terms become negligible. So maybe the assumption is that dr and dθ are infinitesimals, hence higher-order terms vanish.\n\nFor the algebraic approach, the user's mistake is not using the Jacobian determinant properly. The correct approach involves computing the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives. The user only took dx as r cosθ dθ (partial x over partial theta) and dy as cosθ dr (partial y over partial r), but neglected the other partial derivatives. Therefore, the correct Jacobian determinant requires considering all partial derivatives: dx/dr, dx/dθ, dy/dr, dy/dθ. The user didn't do this, hence the error. But this is part of the problem's reasoning, not an assumption.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The coordinate transformation is given by x = r sinθ and y = r cosθ.\n2. The differentials dr and dθ are infinitesimally small.\n3. Higher-order infinitesimals (e.g., terms involving products of more than two infinitesimals) can be neglected.\n\nWait, but in the geometric approach, the user derived the area as r dr dθ plus (dr² dθ)/2. They ask why the second term is ignored. The assumption here is that when dr and dθ are infinitesimal, the term (dr² dθ)/2 is of higher order and thus negligible compared to r dr dθ. So that's another assumption.\n\nFor the algebraic approach, the user's mistake is not considering the full Jacobian. So the assumption is that the transformation is differentiable, and the area element is the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant times dr dθ. But the user didn't apply this correctly.\n\nHowever, in terms of the problem's assumptions, we should list the conditions given in the problem. The user is working with the coordinate transformation x = r sinθ, y = r cosθ, which is non-standard (usually x = r cosθ). But since that's how the user presented it, that's part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo compiling the assumptions:\n\n- The coordinate transformation is defined as \\( x = r \\sin \\theta \\), \\( y = r \\cos \\theta \\).\n- \\( dr \\) and \\( d\\theta \\) are infinitesimally small quantities.\n- Higher-order infinitesimal terms (e.g., \\( dr^2 d\\theta \\)) are negligible.\n- The area element in Cartesian coordinates is \\( dx \\, dy \\).\n- The transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is considered for computing the area element.\n\nWait, but the problem is about proving \\( dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\), so the area element transformation. The user's methods are leading them to incorrect conclusions, so the assumptions are the mathematical framework they're using, which includes the coordinate transformation, infinitesimals, and neglecting higher-order terms.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\( x = r \\sin \\theta \\)\n- \\( y = r \\cos \\theta \\)\n- \\( dr \\) and \\( d\\theta \\) are infinitesimals.\n- Higher-order infinitesimal terms can be neglected.\n- The area element in polar coordinates is derived from the Cartesian area element \\( dx \\, dy \\).\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The relationship between Cartesian and polar coordinates is given by \\( x = r \\sin \\theta \\) and \\( y = r \\cos \\theta \\).\n2. The differentials \\( dr \\) and \\( d\\theta \\) are infinitesimally small.\n3. Higher-order terms in infinitesimals (like \\( (dr)^2 d\\theta \\)) are negligible.\n\nProblem: Prove rigorously that \\( dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\).\n\nThe user's question is why their geometric and algebraic approaches aren't yielding the correct result. The formatted problem should capture the core problem and the assumptions they're working with.\n\nSo final structured problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$x = r \\sin \\theta$,\n$y = r \\cos \\theta$,\n$dr$ and $d\\theta$ are infinitesimally small,\nHigher-order infinitesimal terms are neglected.\nProblem: \nProve rigorously that the area element $dx \\, dy$ is equal to $r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.",
