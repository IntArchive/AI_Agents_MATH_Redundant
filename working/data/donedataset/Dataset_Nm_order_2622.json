    "Content": "I'm trying to teach myself how to do $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$ proofs and would like to know if I solved this proof correctly. The answer given (Spivak, but in the solutions book) was very different. Exercise: Prove $\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\sqrt{x} = 1$ using $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$. My Proof: We have that $0 < |x-1| < \\delta $. Also, $|x - 1| = \\bigl|(\\sqrt{x}-1)(\\sqrt{x}+1)\\bigr| = |\\sqrt{x}-1||\\sqrt{x}+1| < \\delta$. $\\therefore |\\sqrt{x}-1|< \\frac{\\delta}{|\\sqrt{x}+1|}$ Now we let $\\delta = 1$. Then\n\\begin{array}{l}\n-1<x-1<1 \\\\\n\\therefore  0 < x < 2 \\\\\n\\therefore  1 < \\sqrt{x} + 1<\\sqrt{2} + 1 \\\\\n\\therefore  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x} + 1}<1.\n\\end{array} We had that $$|\\sqrt{x}-1|< \\frac{\\delta}{|\\sqrt{x}+1|} \\therefore |\\sqrt{x}-1|<\\delta$$ By letting $\\delta=\\min(1, \\epsilon)$, we get that $|\\sqrt{x}-1|<\\epsilon$ if $0 < |x-1| < \\delta $. Thus, $\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\sqrt{x} = 1$. Is my proof correct? Is there a better way to do it (still using $\\epsilon-\\delta$)?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof is correct but can be simplified. You don't need the part \"Now let $\\delta=1$...\". In fact it is always true that\n$$\n  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt x + 1} \\le 1\n$$\nsince $\\sqrt x \\ge 0$. Also, a matter of style. In the first line you don't have $0 < |x-1|<\\delta$ but you suppose it (this is because $\\delta$ is not already been given, but has to be found yet). The same when you write \"let $\\delta = 1$\" you should write \"if $\\delta \\le 1$ ...\"",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the core problem from the original post.\n\nThe original problem is about proving the limit of sqrt(x) as x approaches 1 is 1 using an epsilon-delta proof. The user provided their own proof and is asking if it's correct or if there's a better way. \n\nNow, the task is to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the problem, the main assumptions here would be related to the definitions and conditions required for an epsilon-delta proof. The key assumptions are:\n\n1. The limit is being proven using the epsilon-delta definition.\n2. x approaches 1.\n3. The function involved is sqrt(x).\n4. The target limit value is 1.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that the limit of sqrt(x) as x approaches 1 is 1 using the epsilon-delta method. The user's proof uses delta = min(1, epsilon), which is a standard approach to bound the values of x near 1. The assumptions should capture the necessary conditions for this proof, like the relationship between delta and epsilon, and the restriction on delta to bound sqrt(x) + 1 away from zero. Wait, but in the user's proof, they let delta = 1 first to establish a lower bound on sqrt(x) + 1. So maybe the assumptions include that delta is chosen as the minimum of 1 and epsilon. However, in the example provided earlier, the assumptions were about the properties of the objects in the problem (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem's assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem, not the steps of the proof. \n\nWait, the original problem is to prove the limit using epsilon-delta. The problem itself doesn't state any assumptions beyond the standard ones for such proofs. The user's proof introduces delta = 1 to bound x between 0 and 2, ensuring sqrt(x) +1 is at least 1. But in terms of the problem's assumptions, the problem itself doesn't have any explicit assumptions except the standard ones for limit proofs. However, maybe in the context of the problem, we need to state the domain of the function, but sqrt(x) is defined for x >=0, and since x approaches 1, we can assume x is in the domain. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number in the domain of sqrt(x) (i.e., x >= 0).\n- The limit is considered as x approaches 1.\n- The proof must use the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly mention these; they are inherent in the problem. However, in the example given, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumptions would include that x is approaching 1, and the function is sqrt(x). But since the example's assumption was about the variable's properties, here maybe:\n\n- x is a real number approaching 1.\n- The function sqrt(x) is considered.\n- The proof must use the epsilon-delta method.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to list only the necessary conditions given in the problem. The problem is to prove the limit, so the assumptions would be the hypotheses required for the problem, not the proof steps. Since the problem doesn't state any specific conditions beyond the standard, maybe the only assumption is that x approaches 1. But the example included the divisibility condition, which was part of the problem's original assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7; that was part of the answer. Wait, no, looking back, the example's original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. The original problem was to prove it for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake in the example. Unless there was a typo. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition. But according to the user's example, the formatted problem's assumption includes n divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem's statement. That suggests that perhaps the example has an error, or maybe the original problem was different. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to show that the problem's original assumptions were misrepresented. But given that, perhaps the instructions are to extract the assumptions from the problem as stated, even if the example seems inconsistent. Hmm. This might complicate things.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to prove that lim_{x→1} sqrt(x) = 1 using epsilon-delta. The assumptions would be the standard ones for such a limit: x is approaching 1, sqrt(x) is defined (x >=0), and the epsilon-delta definition applies. However, since the problem doesn't state any additional conditions, maybe the only assumption is that x approaches 1. But the example included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in that example, there was a mistake. But following the user's example, perhaps we need to list the conditions that are necessary for the problem, even if they are implicit. For the current problem, the function sqrt(x) is defined near x=1, so x must be in the domain (x >=0), but since x approaches 1, we can assume x is close to 1, so x >0. Maybe that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's assumption is that x is approaching 1 from the right, but since the limit is two-sided, and sqrt(x) is defined for x >=0, but approaching 1 would typically consider x near 1, which is in the domain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumptions are just that we're using the epsilon-delta definition. But the example shows that assumptions are about the objects in the problem. For the limit problem, the main objects are x and the function sqrt(x). The assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number approaching 1.\n- The function under consideration is sqrt(x).\n- The limit is evaluated using the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. The problem is to prove that the limit is 1, so the target value is 1. Maybe that's part of the problem statement. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. So here, the assumptions would be about x and the function. But the problem doesn't state any restrictions beyond the standard. So maybe the only explicit assumption is that x approaches 1. But the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (divisible by 7), which suggests that maybe the user wants to list all implicit assumptions as well. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions in the example were incorrect, and the user's actual task is to extract the correct assumptions from the problem. Given that, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number such that 0 < |x - 1| < delta.\n- The function sqrt(x) is defined (i.e., x >= 0).\n- delta is a positive real number.\n- epsilon is a positive real number.\n\nBut perhaps that's too detailed. Alternatively, the problem is to use the epsilon-delta method, so the assumption is that the proof must follow the epsilon-delta definition. But the problem explicitly states that, so maybe:\n\n- The proof must use the epsilon-delta definition.\n- x approaches 1.\n\nBut the example listed assumptions about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), so here x being a real number approaching 1 is an assumption. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem's assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is to be solved. But that would mean altering the original problem's conditions, which is not correct. Unless there was a miscommunication in the example. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as given in the problem. The original problem here is to prove the limit using epsilon-delta. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions beyond the standard, so the assumptions are:\n\n- x is approaching 1.\n- The function is sqrt(x).\n\nBut perhaps more precisely:\n\n- x is a real number in the domain of sqrt(x) (x ≥ 0).\n- The limit is considered as x approaches 1.\n- The proof must follow the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nHowever, the example included two assumptions for the variable n, so here for x, perhaps:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- x approaches 1.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect unless there was a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, and the correct approach is to list the assumptions as they are stated in the problem. Since the current problem is to prove lim_{x→1} sqrt(x) =1 using epsilon-delta, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number approaching 1.\n- The proof must use the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nBut in the example, they added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which suggests that maybe the user wants to infer assumptions from the problem's context. However, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a mistake, and the correct approach is to list the problem's explicit assumptions.\n\nGiven the original problem is to prove the limit using epsilon-delta, the core assumptions are:\n\n- The function under consideration is sqrt(x).\n- The limit is evaluated as x approaches 1.\n- The proof must adhere to the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nBut these are more like problem statements than assumptions. Maybe in the context of the problem, the assumptions are the hypotheses required to apply the epsilon-delta definition, such as x being in the domain of the function near 1, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the standard, so the assumptions section is empty. But the example shows that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number approaching 1.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since the limit is as x approaches 1, the assumption is that x approaches 1. However, in the example, the assumption included a condition on n beyond what was stated. Wait, the original example's problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". This seems to be a mistake unless the original problem was miswritten. Given that, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and the correct approach is to list the assumptions as per the problem's explicit statements.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the explicit assumptions are:\n\n- x approaches 1.\n- The proof uses the epsilon-delta method.\n\nBut the problem statement is \"Prove that lim_{x→1} sqrt(x) =1 using epsilon-delta\", so the assumptions are inherent in the problem. Following the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. This suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract the key conditions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. However, that would be incorrect. It's possible that the example provided by the user is erroneous, and the correct approach is to list the assumptions as given in the problem.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to prove the limit using epsilon-delta. The only assumption is that x approaches 1. But perhaps the function's continuity is an assumption, but that's part of what needs to be proven. Alternatively, the domain of the function: sqrt(x) is defined for x ≥0, so near x=1, x is positive. Therefore, another assumption could be that x is in the domain of the function, i.e., x ≥0. But since x approaches 1, which is in the interior of the domain, the delta can be chosen small enough that x is in (0,2), ensuring x is positive. So maybe the assumption is that x is in the domain of sqrt(x), but that's inherent in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number such that 0 < |x - 1| < delta.\n- delta is a positive real number.\n- epsilon is a positive real number.\n\nBut those are part of the epsilon-delta definition, not assumptions of the problem.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, it's challenging to proceed. However, based on the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". This suggests that the user wants to extract conditions from the problem, possibly including those that are part of the problem's statement but not explicitly labeled as assumptions. \n\nIn the current problem, the core elements are:\n\n- Function: sqrt(x)\n- Limit point: x → 1\n- Target limit: 1\n- Proof method: epsilon-delta\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should capture these elements. Following the example's structure:\n\nAssumption:\nx approaches 1,\nThe function is sqrt(x),\nThe proof uses the epsilon-delta method.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, x approaching 1 is part of the problem's statement. The function is given. The proof method is required by the problem. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe limit is considered as x approaches 1,\nThe function under consideration is sqrt(x),\nThe proof must follow the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\sqrt{x} = 1$.\n\nBut the example's problem section included the expression to prove. So perhaps the problem section here is the same as the original question's main task.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number approaching 1,\nThe function is sqrt(x),\nThe proof must use the epsilon-delta method.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\sqrt{x} = 1$.\n\nHowever, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), which were part of the problem's conditions. Here, the variable x approaching 1 is part of the limit's definition, so it's inherent. The function is given, and the proof method is required. But perhaps the user wants to list these as assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem's assumptions are the hypotheses needed to apply the epsilon-delta definition. For the limit to exist, the function must be defined in a neighborhood around the point except possibly at the point itself. Since sqrt(x) is defined for x ≥0, and we're approaching 1, which is in the interior of the domain (since x=1 has neighborhoods where x>0), the assumptions would include that x is in the domain of sqrt(x) near 1. But this is more of an implicit assumption.\n\nGiven the example's structure, which included assumptions about the variable (n) even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", perhaps here the assumptions should list that x is a real number and that the proof uses epsilon-delta. However, since the problem explicitly states to use epsilon-delta, that's part of the problem's instruction, not an assumption.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the correct formatting for this problem, following the example's approach (even if the example might be flawed), is:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx approaches 1,\nThe proof uses the epsilon-delta definition.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\sqrt{x} = 1$.\n\nThis captures the key elements: the variable x is real, approaching 1, and the method required. The function sqrt(x) is part of the problem statement, so it's included in the problem section.",
