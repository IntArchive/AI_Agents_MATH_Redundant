    "Content": "Let $T : V\\to V$ be a linear transformation such that $\\dim\\operatorname{Range}(T)=k\\leq n$ , where $n=\\dim V$ . Show that $T$ can have at most $k+1$ distinct eigenvalues. I can realize that the rank  will correspond to the number of non-zero eigenvalues (counted up to multiplicity) and the nullity will correspond to the 0 eigenvalue (counted up to multiplicity), but I cannot design an analytical proof of this. Thanks for any help .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since the nullity of $T$ is $n-k$, that means that the geometric multiplicity of $\\lambda=0$ as an eigenvalue of $T$ is $n-k$; hence, the algebraic multiplicity must be at least $n-k$, which means that the characteristic polynomial of $T$ is of the form $x^{N}g(x)$, where $N$ is the algebraic multiplicity of $0$, hence $N\\geq n-k$ (so $n-N\\leq k$), and $\\deg(g) =n-N$. Thus, $g$ has at most $n-N$ distinct roots, none of which are equal to $0$, and that means that the characteristic polynomial of $T$ has exactly:\n$$1 + \\text{# distinct roots of }g \\leq 1 + n-N \\leq 1 + k$$\ndistinct eigenvalues. Note that in fact we can say a bit better that $T$ has at most $\\min\\{k+1,n\\}$ distinct eigenvalues (when the rank is $n$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about showing that a linear transformation T with rank k can have at most k+1 distinct eigenvalues. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that T is a linear transformation from V to V, so that's one assumption. The dimension of the range of T is k, which is less than or equal to n, where n is the dimension of V. Wait, the user mentions n = dim V, so that's another assumption. \n\nWait, the problem says \"dim Range(T) = k ≤ n\" and \"n = dim V\". So I should list each assumption separately. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. T is a linear transformation from V to V (i.e., T: V → V).\n2. The dimension of the range of T is k (dim Range(T) = k).\n3. k is less than or equal to n (k ≤ n).\n4. The dimension of V is n (dim V = n).\n\nBut wait, maybe some of these can be combined or phrased more precisely. The problem statement says \"dim Range(T) = k ≤ n, where n = dim V\". So the key points are:\n\n- T is a linear operator on V (since V→V).\n- Rank(T) = k.\n- n = dim(V).\n- k ≤ n.\n\nBut perhaps the last two can be separate. Let me check the example given. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it was listed as \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So here, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. T is a linear transformation from V to V.\n2. The rank of T is k (dim Range(T) = k).\n3. The dimension of V is n (dim V = n).\n4. k is less than or equal to n (k ≤ n).\n\nWait, but k ≤ n is a consequence of rank-nullity theorem, but the problem states it explicitly as given. So maybe the user includes that as an assumption. But perhaps the problem states \"k ≤ n\" as a given condition, so we have to include it. Alternatively, maybe the problem just mentions that dim Range(T) = k, and since the rank cannot exceed the dimension of V, k ≤ n is automatically true. But the original problem states \"k ≤ n\" as part of the problem statement. So yes, we need to list it as an assumption.\n\nNow, the problem is to show that T can have at most k+1 distinct eigenvalues.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a linear transformation from V to V,\nThe rank of T is k,\nThe dimension of V is n,\nk is less than or equal to n.\n\nProblem:\nShow that T can have at most k+1 distinct eigenvalues.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is more general. Let me check if all the listed assumptions are necessary. For example, the problem states \"dim Range(T) = k ≤ n, where n = dim V\". So the user mentions that n = dim V, which is necessary to relate k and n. So each of these should be separate assumptions. So each line in the assumption section should be a single condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a linear transformation on V (i.e., T: V → V),\nThe dimension of V is n,\nThe rank of T is k,\nk is less than or equal to n.\n\nProblem:\nShow that T can have at most k+1 distinct eigenvalues.\n\nThat seems right. Let me check if any other assumptions are missing. For example, the problem is about eigenvalues, which require that we are working over an algebraically closed field? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the field. However, since eigenvalues' existence can depend on the field, but the problem as stated doesn't mention anything about the field. So perhaps the original problem assumes that the field is algebraically closed, but since it's not stated, we shouldn't include it as an assumption unless it's part of the original problem. The original question doesn't mention the field, so we can't assume that. Therefore, the assumptions listed are only what's given in the problem statement.",
