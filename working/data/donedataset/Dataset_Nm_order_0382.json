    "Content": "Zhautykov Olympiad 2015 problem 6 This links discusses the  olympiad problem which none of students could solve , meaning it is very hard. Question: The area of a convex pentagon $ABCDE$ is $S$, and the circumradii of the triangles $ABC$, $BCD$, $CDE$, $DEA$, $EAB$ are $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, $R_4$, $R_5$. Prove the inequality \n  $$R_1^4+R_2^4+R_3^4+R_4^4+R_5^4\\geq {4\\over 5\\sin^2 108^\\circ}S^2$$ A month ago,I tried to  solve this problem,because I know the following Möbius  theorem(1880): Theorem :\nLet $a,b,c,d,e$ are area of $\\Delta ABC,\\Delta BCD,\\Delta CDE,\\Delta DEA,\\Delta EAB$,then we have\n$$S^2-S(a+b+c+d+e)+ab+bc+cd+de+ea=0$$\nThis is a result by Gauss 1880,you can see this paper (for proof): (Gauss Carl Fridrich Gauss Werke Vol 4.2ter Abdruck,1880:406-407) Using this Theorem ,in 2002 ,Chen Ji and Xiongbin proved this result: $$a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2\\ge\\dfrac{20S^2}{(5+\\sqrt{5})^2}$$ I use the well known result: $$a\\le\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}R^2_{1},b\\le\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}R^2_{2},c\\le\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}R^2_{3},d\\le\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}R^2_{4},e\\le\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}R^2_{5}$$\nso we have\n$$R_1^4+R_2^4+R_3^4+R_4^4+R_5^4\\ge\\dfrac{16}{27}(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2)\n\\ge\\dfrac{16\\cdot 20}{27(5+\\sqrt{5})^2}S^2$$ But I found \n$$\\dfrac{16\\cdot 20}{27(5+\\sqrt{5})^2}<\\dfrac{32}{5(5+\\sqrt{5})}={4\\over 5\\sin^2 108^\\circ}$$\nso my work can't solve this contest problem. If we can solve following question,then the Olympiad problem can be solved: Question 2: $$a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2\\ge\\dfrac{54}{5(5+\\sqrt{5})}S^2$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Dan Schwarz (one of the major problem proposers for EGMO, RMM, Balkan...) has posted a solution at here . I'll briefly sketch it here. First, one takes the midpoints $M_1$, ..., $M_5$ of $A_1A_2$, ..., $A_5A_1$. Then at each angle $A_i$, one takes the circumcircle of triangle $M_{i-1}A_iM_{i+1}$ (which has radius $\\frac 12 R_i$) and the point diametrically opposite $A_i$ on it, say $X_i$. This gives a quadrilateral $A_iA_{i-1}X_iA_{i+1}$, with area at most $(\\frac 12 R_i)^2 \\cdot 2\\sin A_i$. Consider all five of these quadrilaterals, as shown. It's not too hard to show that these five quadrilaterals cover the entire pentagon (look at perpendicular bisectors). So summing gives\n$$ S \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i R_i^2 \\sin A_i. $$\nThen, by the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have\n$$ 4S^2 \\le \\left( \\sum_i R_i^2 \\sin A_i \\right)^2 \\le \\left( \\sum_i R_i^4 \\right) \\left( \\sum_i \\sin^2 A_i \\right). $$\nSo it remains to show $$\\sum_i \\sin^2 A_i \\le 5\\sin^2 (108^{\\circ})$$ reducing this to a purely algebraic problem (with $0^{\\circ} \\le A_i \\le 180^{\\circ}$ and $\\sum A_i = 540^{\\circ}$). It's tempting to try and apply, say, Jensen's Inequality, but the function $\\sin^2 x$ has a few inflection points, so one has to proceed more delicately using a fudging argument (along the lines of the $n-1$ equal-value trick ). Indeed, we do this by showing that if $A_1 \\le A_2 \\le A_3 \\le A_4 \\le A_5$ and $A_1 < 108^{\\circ}$, then we can replace $A_1$ with $108^{\\circ}$ and $A_5$ by $A_1+A_5-108^{\\circ}$ while increasing $\\sum_i \\sin^2 A_i$. Repeating this process until all $A_i$ are equal completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The original question is about proving a geometric inequality involving the circumradii of triangles in a convex pentagon and its area. The user provided a lot of background information, including references to theorems by Möbius, Gauss, and work by Chen Ji and Xiongbin. My task is to extract the key assumptions and the main problem statement, following the given format.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main problem. The title states: \"How prove this geometry inequality $R_1^4+R_2^4+R_3^4+R_4^4+R_5^4\\geq {4\\over 5\\sin^2 108^\\circ}S^2$\". The question itself repeats this inequality, specifying that $ABCDE$ is a convex pentagon with area $S$, and $R_1$ to $R_5$ are the circumradii of the triangles ABC, BCD, CDE, DEA, EAB respectively. The problem is to prove this inequality.\n\nNow, the assumptions. The problem mentions a convex pentagon, so that's one assumption. Each of the triangles (ABC, BCD, etc.) has a circumradius R1 to R5. The area of the pentagon is S. These are the given conditions. The user also references several theorems, but those are part of their attempt, not the original problem's assumptions. The original problem's assumptions are just the convex pentagon with area S and the circumradii of the five triangles. \n\nWait, the problem statement doesn't specify any additional constraints, like the pentagon being regular or something else. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. $ABCDE$ is a convex pentagon.\n2. The area of $ABCDE$ is $S$.\n3. $R_1$ is the circumradius of triangle $ABC$.\n4. $R_2$ is the circumradius of triangle $BCD$.\n5. $R_3$ is the circumradius of triangle $CDE$.\n6. $R_4$ is the circumradius of triangle $DEA$.\n7. $R_5$ is the circumradius of triangle $EAB$.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applying to one object. Then the problem is to prove the given inequality involving the fourth powers of the circumradii and the square of the area S.\n\nI need to list all seven assumptions, each on its own line. Then state the problem as given. The rest of the information in the original question, like the theorems and the user's attempts, are not part of the problem's assumptions, so they should be filtered out. The key is to present only the necessary conditions given in the problem statement, not the attempted solutions or external theorems used by the user.",
