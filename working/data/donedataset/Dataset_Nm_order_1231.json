    "Content": "In a paper that I wrote as an undergraduate student, I conjectured that the only integer solutions to the equation\n$$|5x^2 - y^2| = 4$$\noccur when $x$ is a Fibonacci number and $y$ is a Lucas number. I was able to prove that when $x$ was a Fibonacci number there existed a Lucas number $y$ such that $|5x^2 - y^2| = 4$. This is easily shown with Cassini's Identity $$F_{n-1}F_{n+1} - F_{n}^2 = (-1)^n$$ The challenge is this ... prove (or disprove) that these are the ONLY solutions. By the way, this is how I generated the Diophantine equation.\n$$F_{n-1}F_{n+1} - F_{n}^2 = (-1)^n$$\n$$F_{n-1}(F_{n}+F_{n-1}) - F_{n}^2 = (-1)^n$$\n$$F_n^2 - F_{n-1}F_n-F_{n-1}^2+(-1)^n=0$$\nbecause $F_n \\gt \\frac{F_{n-1}}{2}$\n$$F_n=\\frac{F_{n-1} + \\sqrt{F_{n-1}^2-4((-1)^n-F_{n-1}^2)}}{2}=\\frac{F_{n-1} + \\sqrt{5F_{n-1}^2+4((-1)^{n+1})}}{2}$$\nLetting $y= \\pm \\sqrt{5F_{n-1}^2+4((-1)^{n+1})}$ and $x=F_{n-1}$ we have\n$$y= \\pm \\sqrt{5x^2+4((-1)^{n+1})}$$\n$$y^2= 5x^2 \\pm 4$$\n$$|5x^2 - y^2| = 4$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let me interchange $x$ and $y$ for my own convenience. We want to solve $$x^2 - 5y^2 = \\pm 4$$ over the integers. Solving these equations corresponds to finding the elements of norm $\\pm 4$ in the quadratic integer ring $\\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$, where the norm is the function given by $$N(x+\\sqrt{5}y) = (x+\\sqrt{5}y)(x-\\sqrt{5}y) = x^2 - 5y^2.$$ Finding these elements is an exercise in algebraic number theory.\nThe real quadratic number field $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ has $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ with $\\omega = (1+\\sqrt{5})/2$ as its ring of integers, and $\\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$ is a subring of this. The field norm on $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ agrees with the norm given above for elements of $\\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$. Lemma I.7.2 in Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory yields that up to multiplication by units in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$, there are only finitely many elements of a given norm in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$. Since $\\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{5}] \\subset \\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ and the norms agree, up to multiplication by units in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ there are only finitely many elements of norm $4$ in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$. By Dirichlet's unit theorem the group of units of $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ has rank $1$.\nA generator of this group, or a fundamental unit of $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$, is given by $$\\varepsilon = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2},$$ which has norm $-1$. Since the norm of an element $\\alpha$ is the same as the norm of the principal ideal $(\\alpha)$, it is useful to determine the number of ideals of norm $4$ in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$.\nBy this answer to an other question this number is $$\\sum_{m|4} \\chi(m) = \\chi(1) + \\chi(2) + \\chi(4) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.$$ Hence if $\\alpha, \\beta$ are two elements of norm $4$, then $(\\alpha) = (\\beta)$, so $\\beta = u\\alpha$ for a unit $u$. That is, up to multiplication by units in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ there is only one element $\\alpha$ of norm $4$. Take $\\alpha = 2$; then all the elements of norm $4$ in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ are given by $2\\varepsilon^n$, for integer $n$.\nBut since $2\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega] \\subset \\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$, all of these elements in fact belong to $\\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{5}]$.\nHence all the solutions to the original equation are the $(x_n, y_n)$ given by $2\\varepsilon^n = x_n + \\sqrt{5}y_n$. From the identity $\\varphi^n = \\frac{L_n + \\sqrt{5}F_n}{2}$ of real numbers for nonnegative $n$ mentioned at the end of this section of the Wikipedia article on Lucas numbers it follows that $$2\\varepsilon^n = L_n + \\sqrt{5}F_n$$ for nonnegative $n$. For negative $n$ you get extra solutions like $(1,-1)$ and $(-3,1)$, but you could have predicted those from the beginning: if $(x,y)$ is a solution, then so are $(-x,y)$, $(x,-y)$ and $(-x,-y)$. I should mention that with SAGE you can do calculations in $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$, K.<s> = QuadraticField(5)\neps = (1+s)/2 # = K.units()[0]\nfor n in range(0,15):\n    print 2*eps^n and also with Fibonacci and Lucas numbers: for n in range(0,15):\n    print (fibonacci(n), lucas_number2(n,1,-1)) These two pieces of code give the same output (up to formatting). Edit (01/11/14) : A more elementary way to see that there is only one ideal of norm 4 in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ is as follows: The quadratic field $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ has discriminant $5$ and has no complex embeddings; hence by this inequality we have $N(I) \\geq N(x)/\\sqrt{5}$ for any ideal $I$ and element $x \\in I$.\nSince $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ is a Dedekind domain we have unique factorization of ideals into primes.\nFor a prime $\\mathfrak{p} \\subset \\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ lying over $p$ we get $N(\\mathfrak{p}) \\geq p^2/\\sqrt{5}$.\nSince $p^2/\\sqrt{5} > 4$ for $p > 2$, the primes of norm at most $4$ must lie over $2$. The minimal polynomial $X^2 - X - 1$ of $\\omega$ is irreducible mod $2$, so $2$ is inert in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$ by the Kummer-Dedekind theorem. That is, $(2)$ is the only prime with norm at most $4$, and its norm is exactly $4$. By unique factorization into primes and multiplicativity of the norm, $(2)$ is the only ideal of norm $4$ in $\\mathbf{Z}[\\omega]$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about finding all integer solutions to the equation |5x² - y²| = 4. The user mentioned that they conjectured the solutions are when x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number. They proved one direction but need to show these are the only solutions.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is about integer solutions, so the main assumption is that x and y are integers. However, in the example provided earlier, there was an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the problem here, the user doesn't specify any additional constraints like divisibility. The original problem just states \"Find all integer solutions...\", so the key assumption here is that x and y are integers. But maybe there's more? Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe problem says \"Find all integer solutions for the equation |5x² - y²| = 4\". The user conjectures that the solutions occur when x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number. They proved that if x is Fibonacci, then such y exists as Lucas numbers, but they need to prove the converse: that only these x and y satisfy the equation.\n\nWait, so the problem is to find all integer solutions (x, y) such that |5x² - y²| = 4. The user's conjecture is that these solutions are precisely when x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number. The task is to prove or disprove that these are the only solutions.\n\nSo, in terms of assumptions, the problem is asking for integer solutions. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is an integer\n- y is an integer\n\nBut in the example given, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's condition. Here, there are no such additional constraints mentioned. The problem is to find all integer solutions, so the assumptions are simply that x and y are integers. The problem is to prove that the only integer solutions are those where x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number. Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user says \"the only integer solutions... occur when x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number\". So the problem is to show that if |5x² - y²| = 4, then x must be a Fibonacci number and y a Lucas number. Therefore, the problem as stated is \"Prove that the only integer solutions to |5x² - y²| = 4 are those where x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number.\"\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, perhaps the only assumptions are that x and y are integers. So the formatted problem should list those as assumptions and then the problem is to prove that the only solutions are with x as Fibonacci and y as Lucas.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention any restrictions on x and y other than being integers. So the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is an integer,\ny is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only integer solutions to |5x² - y²| = 4 are those with x being a Fibonacci number and y being a Lucas number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find all integer solutions, but the conjecture is that they are the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. So the problem as posed is to find all integer solutions, and the conjecture is that these are exactly the Fibonacci/Lucas pairs. So the problem statement is \"Find all integer solutions for the equation |5x² - y²| = 4\", and the user's conjecture is that they are only the pairs with x Fibonacci and y Lucas. Therefore, the problem is to prove or disprove that conjecture.\n\nBut the user's question is to \"prove (or disprove) that these are the ONLY solutions.\" So the problem is as stated: \"Prove that the only integer solutions to |5x² - y²| = 4 occur when x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are that x and y are integers, and the problem is to show that under these conditions, the equation holds only when x is Fibonacci and y is Lucas.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the problem as presented here, there's no such divisibility condition. So perhaps the only assumptions here are x and y are integers. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is an integer,\ny is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only integer solutions to |5x² - y²| = 4 are those where x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number.\n\nAlternatively, if there's an implicit assumption that x and y are positive integers, but the problem doesn't specify, since the absolute value is taken, so solutions could include negative y as well. However, since Lucas numbers can be negative depending on the definition, but typically they are defined for non-negative indices, leading to positive numbers. But the problem says \"Lucas number\" which usually refers to the standard sequence starting with 2,1,3,4, etc. So perhaps the problem allows y to be positive or negative, but x is positive. Wait, but the original problem doesn't specify positivity. So the user might have considered x and y as integers, positive or negative. But in the context of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, they are usually considered as positive integers. However, the problem statement here is about integer solutions, so x and y can be any integers. However, the conjecture is about x being a Fibonacci number (which are positive integers) and y being Lucas numbers (also positive integers). Therefore, maybe the problem is to show that all integer solutions (x,y) with |5x² - y²|=4 must have x a Fibonacci number and y a Lucas number (with possible signs for y). But the problem statement says \"the only integer solutions... occur when x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number.\" So the problem is to prove that any integer solution (x,y) must have x as a Fibonacci number and y as a Lucas number, possibly up to sign. But in the problem statement, the user mentions that they let y = ±√(...), so y can be positive or negative. Therefore, the problem might need to consider y as a Lucas number up to sign.\n\nBut in terms of assumptions, the key ones are x and y are integers. The problem is to show that for any integer x and y satisfying |5x² - y²|=4, x must be a Fibonacci number and y must be a Lucas number. Therefore, the formatted problem would list x and y as integers, and the problem is to prove that those are the only solutions.\n\nI need to check the original problem again. The user wrote: \"Find all integer solutions for the equation |5x^2 - y^2| = 4\". Then they say they conjectured that the only solutions are when x is Fibonacci and y is Lucas. They proved one direction but need to prove the converse. So the problem is to find all integer solutions, and the conjecture is that they are precisely the (Fibonacci, Lucas) pairs. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is an integer,\ny is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only integer solutions to |5x² - y²| = 4 are those where x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find all solutions, and the conjecture is the answer, then maybe the problem is as stated: Find all integer solutions... but the user wants to prove their conjecture that the solutions are only those pairs. Therefore, the problem as formatted would be:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only integer solutions to |5x² - y²| = 4 occur when x is a Fibonacci number and y is a Lucas number.\n\nAnd the assumptions are that x and y are integers.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. The example given in the user's message had the assumptions listed line by line, each for one property. Here, two assumptions: x is integer, y is integer. Each on their own line. Then the problem is to prove that those solutions are only the Fibonacci and Lucas pairs.",
