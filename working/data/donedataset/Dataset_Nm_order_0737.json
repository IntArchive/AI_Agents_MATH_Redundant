    "Content": "The inequality $\\sqrt{\\frac{a^b}{b}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{b^a}{a}}\\ge 2$ for all $a,b>0$ was shown here using first-order Padé approximants on each exponent, where the minimum is attained at $a=b=1$ . By empirical evidence, it appears that inequalities of this type hold for an arbitrary number of variables. We can phrase the generalised problem as follows. Let $(x_i)_{1\\le i\\le n}$ be a sequence of positive real numbers. Define $\\boldsymbol a=\\begin{pmatrix}a_1&\\cdots&a_n\\end{pmatrix}$ such that $a_k=x_k^{x_{k+1}}/x_{k+1}$ for each $1\\le k<n$ and $a_n=x_n^{x_1}/x_1$ . How do we show that $$\\|\\boldsymbol a\\|_p^p\\ge n$$ for any $p\\ge1$ ? As before, AM-GM is far too weak since the inequality $\\displaystyle\\|\\boldsymbol a\\|_p^p\\ge 2\\left(\\prod_{\\text{cyc}}\\frac{x_1^{x_2}}{x_2}\\right)^{1/{2p}}$ does not guarantee the result when at least one $x_i$ is smaller than $1$ . We can eliminate the exponent on the denominator by taking $x_i=X_i^{1/p}$ so that $\\displaystyle\\|\\boldsymbol a\\|_p^p=\\sum_{\\text{cyc}}\\frac{X_1^{X_2^{1/p}}}{X_2}$ but the approximant approach no longer becomes feasible; even in the case where $p$ is an integer the problem reduces to a posynomial inequality of rational degrees. Perhaps there are some obscure $L^p$ -norm/Hölder-type identities of use but I'm at a loss in terms of finding references. Empirical results: In the interval $p\\in[1,\\infty)$ , Wolfram suggests that the minimum is $n$ ( Notebook result ) which is obtained when $\\boldsymbol a$ is the vector of ones. However, we note that in the interval $p\\in(0,1)$ , the empirical minimum no longer displays this consistent behaviour as can be seen in this Notebook result .\nThe sequence $\\approx(1.00,2.00,2.01,3.36,3.00,4.00)$ appears to increase almost linearly every two values, but I cannot verify it for a larger number of variables due to instability in the working precision.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proof for $p ≥ 1$ Since $u^p - 1 ≥ p(u - 1)$ for all $u ≥ 0$ , it suffices to prove the result for $p = 1$ . That follows from $$\\frac{x^y}{y} - 1 ≥ \\frac{1 + y \\ln x}{y} - 1\n= \\ln x + \\frac1y - 1 ≥ \\ln x + \\ln \\frac1y = \\ln x - \\ln y$$ by cyclic summation over $(x, y) = (x_i, x_{i + 1})$ . Conjectured proof for $p ≥ \\frac12$ Since $u^p - 1 ≥ 2p(u^{\\frac12} - 1)$ for all $u ≥ 0$ , it suffices to prove the result for $p = \\frac12$ . Numerical evidence suggests that $$\\left(\\frac{x^y}{y}\\right)^{\\frac12} - 1 ≥ \\frac{\\ln x}{2\\sqrt[4]{1 + \\frac13 \\ln^2 x}} - \\frac{\\ln y}{2\\sqrt[4]{1 + \\frac13 \\ln^2 y}}$$ for all $x, y > 0$ . If this is true, cyclic summation yields the desired result. Counterexample for $0 < p < \\frac12$ Let $g(x) = \\left(\\frac{x^{1/x}}{1/x}\\right)^p + \\left(\\frac{(1/x)^x}{x}\\right)^p$ . Then $g(1) = 2$ , $g'(1) = 0$ , and $g''(1) = 4p(2p - 1) < 0$ , so we have $g(x) < 2$ for $x$ in some neighborhood of $1$ . This yields counterexamples for all even $n$ : $$\\left(x, \\frac1x, x, \\frac1x, \\dotsc, x, \\frac1x\\right), \\quad x ≈ 1, \\quad 0 < p < \\frac12.$$ For $n = 3$ , the best counterexample seems to be $$(0.41398215, 0.73186577, 4.77292996), \\quad 0 < p < 0.39158477.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is talking about an inequality involving cyclic terms. The main problem is to show that the p-norm of a certain vector is at least n for any p ≥ 1. The vector a is defined such that each component a_k is x_k^{x_{k+1}} divided by x_{k+1}, with a cyclic structure where the last term wraps around to x_n^{x_1}/x_1.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions that all variables are positive real numbers. Each a_k is defined in terms of the x_i's cyclically. Also, p is given to be greater than or equal to 1. The inequality should hold for any such p and any n. \n\nWait, the original problem states that (x_i) is a sequence of positive real numbers. So each x_i is positive. Then, the vector a is constructed by taking each x_k^{x_{k+1}} divided by x_{k+1}, and this cycles so that the last term is x_n^{x_1}/x_1. \n\nSo assumptions would be:\n\nEach x_i is a positive real number.\n\nFor each k from 1 to n-1, a_k = x_k^{x_{k+1}} / x_{k+1}.\n\na_n = x_n^{x_1} / x_1.\n\np is greater than or equal to 1.\n\nThe problem is to show that the p-norm of vector a raised to the pth power is at least n. That is, the sum of each a_k^p is ≥ n.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example had each assumption as a separate line. So each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- For each 1 ≤ k < n, a_k = x_k^{x_{k+1}} / x_{k+1}.\n\n- a_n = x_n^{x_1} / x_1.\n\n- Each x_i is a positive real number.\n\n- p is a real number such that p ≥ 1.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, each individual condition. So for example, each component of a is defined as per the cyclic rule. So I should list each assumption separately.\n\nLet me check the original problem's wording:\n\n\"Let (x_i)_{1≤i≤n} be a sequence of positive real numbers. Define a vector a such that a_k = x_k^{x_{k+1}}/x_{k+1} for each 1 ≤k <n and a_n =x_n^{x_1}/x_1. How do we show that ||a||_p^p ≥n for any p≥1?\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. x_i is a positive real number for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\n\n2. For each 1 ≤ k <n, a_k = x_k^{x_{k+1}} / x_{k+1}.\n\n3. a_n = x_n^{x_1} / x_1.\n\n4. p ≥ 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. So in the Assumption section, each line should state one of these.\n\nThe problem is then to show that the p-norm raised to the pth power is at least n.\n\nI need to make sure that the problem statement is correctly captured. The user mentions \"||a||_p^p ≥n\". Since the p-norm is (sum |a_k|^p)^(1/p), so the pth power is sum |a_k|^p. So the problem is to show that the sum of a_k^p is ≥n.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement would be: Show that the sum of a_k^p from k=1 to n is greater than or equal to n for any p ≥1.\n\nBut in the original problem, they wrote it using cyclc notation: sum_{cyc} (x1^{x2}/x2)^p + ... ≥n. So the problem is phrased as the sum of each term (x_k^{x_{k+1}} /x_{k+1})^p over the cyclic indices, which equals the sum of a_k^p, is at least n.\n\nTherefore, the problem is: Show that the sum of [(x_k^{x_{k+1}} / x_{k+1})^p] from k=1 to n is greater than or equal to n for any p ≥1, given that each x_i is positive.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Each x_i is a positive real number.\n\n- For each 1 ≤ k < n, a_k = x_k^{x_{k+1}} / x_{k+1}.\n\n- a_n = x_n^{x_1} / x_1.\n\n- p is a real number such that p ≥ 1.\n\nProblem: Show that the sum of a_k^p from k=1 to n is greater than or equal to n.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote ||a||_p^p. Since the p-norm to the pth power is sum a_k^p. So the problem is equivalent to showing that ||a||_p^p ≥n.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement can be written as: Show that ||a||_p^p ≥ n for any p ≥1.\n\nBut to make it precise, perhaps in LaTeX:\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\sum_{\\text{cyc}} \\left( \\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}} \\right)^p \\ge n$$ for any $p \\ge 1$.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement can include the formula as given. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the problem was written as:\n\nproblem: Prove that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nSo the problem statement includes the formula. So here, the problem statement should include the cyclic sum expression.\n\nBut in the original question, the user wrote:\n\nHow do we show that $$\\|\\boldsymbol a\\|_p^p\\ge n$$ for any $p\\ge1$ ?\n\nBut the definition of a is given as a_k = x_k^{x_{k+1}}/x_{k+1} cyclically.\n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is best written as the original expression with the cyclic sum. However, to make it clear, perhaps the problem statement can use the cyclic sum notation.\n\nAlternatively, use the vector norm expression. But given the example uses the formula, perhaps the problem statement should have the explicit sum with cyclic terms.\n\nSo the problem would be:\n\nShow that $$\\left(\\frac{x_1^{x_2}}{x_2}\\right)^p + \\left(\\frac{x_2^{x_3}}{x_3}\\right)^p + \\cdots + \\left(\\frac{x_n^{x_1}}{x_1}\\right)^p \\ge n$$ for any $p \\ge 1$.\n\nYes, that matches the title of the question as well.\n\nTherefore, compiling all the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Each $x_i$ is a positive real number.\n\n- For each $1 \\le k < n$, $a_k = \\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}$.\n\n- $a_n = \\frac{x_n^{x_1}}{x_1}$.\n\n- $p$ is a real number with $p \\ge 1$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that $$\\left(\\frac{x_1^{x_2}}{x_2}\\right)^p + \\left(\\frac{x_2^{x_3}}{x_3}\\right)^p + \\cdots + \\left(\\frac{x_n^{x_1}}{x_1}\\right)^p \\ge n$$ for any $p \\ge 1$.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they didn't list all the definitions of a_k as separate assumptions. The example only listed the conditions on n. So perhaps here, the definitions of a_k are part of the problem setup rather than assumptions. Let me check the original problem.\n\nIn the original problem, the user defines a vector a with components a_k as specified. So the problem is given that the vector a is constructed in this cyclic manner, and the goal is to show that the p-norm to the pth power is at least n. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem statement, which are:\n\n- The sequence (x_i) is a sequence of positive real numbers.\n\n- The vector a is defined such that each a_k is x_k^{x_{k+1}} / x_{k+1} cyclically.\n\n- p ≥1.\n\nTherefore, breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Each $x_i$ is a positive real number.\n\n- The vector $\\boldsymbol a$ is defined such that $a_k = \\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}$ for $1 \\le k < n$ and $a_n = \\frac{x_n^{x_1}}{x_1}$.\n\n- $p$ is a real number with $p \\ge 1$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that $\\|\\boldsymbol a\\|_p^p \\ge n$.\n\nBut the problem in the example included the formula in the problem statement. Since the title of the question uses the cyclic sum with the terms, perhaps the problem statement should present the sum explicitly as in the title.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\left(\\frac{x_1^{x_2}}{x_2}\\right)^p+\\left(\\frac{x_2^{x_3}}{x_3}\\right)^p+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{x_n^{x_1}}{x_1}\\right)^p\\ge n$$ for any $p\\ge1$.\n\nYes, that's the exact expression from the title and the user's problem statement.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nEach x_i is a positive real number.\n\nFor each 1 ≤ k < n, the term is x_k^{x_{k+1}} / x_{k+1}.\n\nThe last term is x_n^{x_1} / x_1.\n\np is at least 1.\n\nBut to phrase each assumption as a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Each $x_i$ is a positive real number for $1 \\le i \\le n$.\n\n- For each $1 \\le k \\le n$, the term $\\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}$ is defined cyclically with $x_{n+1} = x_1$.\n\n- $p$ is a real number such that $p \\ge 1$.\n\nWait, but the cyclicity is part of the problem's setup. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The sequence $(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$ consists of positive real numbers.\n\n- The expression $\\left(\\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}\\right)^p$ is defined for each $1 \\le k \\le n$ with $x_{n+1} = x_1$.\n\n- $p \\ge 1$.\n\nBut perhaps splitting each assumption as per the components:\n\n1. For each $1 \\le i \\le n$, $x_i > 0$.\n\n2. The sequence is cyclic, i.e., $x_{n+1} = x_1$.\n\n3. For each $1 \\le k \\le n$, $a_k = \\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}$.\n\n4. $p \\ge 1$.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as:\n\n$n$ is an integer,\n\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object. So here:\n\nEach x_i is a positive real number.\n\nThe sequence is cyclic (i.e., x_{n+1} is defined as x_1).\n\nEach a_k is defined as x_k^{x_{k+1}} / x_{k+1} for 1 ≤k ≤n.\n\np is a real number with p ≥1.\n\nBut the cyclicity is part of the definition of the terms, so perhaps the third assumption should be:\n\nFor each $1 \\le k \\le n$, $a_k = \\frac{x_k^{x_{(k \\mod n) +1}}}{x_{(k \\mod n)+1}}$} but that might be complicating. Alternatively, just state that the indices are cyclic, so after x_n comes x_1.\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions \"cyclic\" in the sum. However, in the assumptions, it's important to note that the sequence is cyclic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the definition of a_k already implies cyclicity, so when k = n, a_n = x_n^{x_1}/x_1. So the assumptions can be:\n\n- For each $1 \\le k \\le n$, $a_k = \\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}$ where $x_{n+1} = x_1$.\n\n- Each $x_i$ is a positive real number.\n\n- $p \\ge 1$.\n\nSo each of these as separate lines.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Each $x_i$ is a positive real number.\n\n- For each $1 \\le k \\le n$, $a_k = \\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}$ with $x_{n+1} = x_1$.\n\n- $p$ is a real number such that $p \\ge 1$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that $$\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^p \\ge n.$$\n\nBut the user's original problem uses the cyclic sum notation in the title and the question. So maybe it's better to present the problem as the cyclic sum of those terms, which is equivalent to the sum of a_k^p.\n\nThus, the problem statement can be written as:\n\nShow that $$\\left(\\frac{x_1^{x_2}}{x_2}\\right)^p + \\left(\\frac{x_2^{x_3}}{x_3}\\right)^p + \\cdots + \\left(\\frac{x_n^{x_1}}{x_1}\\right)^p \\ge n$$ for any $p \\ge 1$.\n\nYes, this is the expression given in the title and the problem description.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Each $x_i$ is a positive real number.\n\n- For each $1 \\le k \\le n$, the term $\\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}$ is defined cyclically with $x_{n+1} = x_1$.\n\n- $p$ is a real number such that $p \\ge 1$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that $$\\left(\\frac{x_1^{x_2}}{x_2}\\right)^p + \\left(\\frac{x_2^{x_3}}{x_3}\\right)^p + \\cdots + \\left(\\frac{x_n^{x_1}}{x_1}\\right)^p \\ge n$$ for any $p \\ge 1$.\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down the second assumption into the cyclic definition:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Each $x_i$ is a positive real number.\n\n- For each $1 \\le k \\le n$, $a_k = \\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}$ where $x_{n+1} = x_1$.\n\n- $p$ is a real number such that $p \\ge 1$.\n\nThis way, each line is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach $x_i$ is a positive real number,\nFor each $1 \\le k \\le n$, $a_k = \\frac{x_k^{x_{k+1}}}{x_{k+1}}$ where $x_{n+1} = x_1$,\n$p$ is a real number such that $p \\ge 1$.\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\left(\\frac{x_1^{x_2}}{x_2}\\right)^p+\\left(\\frac{x_2^{x_3}}{x_3}\\right)^p+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{x_n^{x_1}}{x_1}\\right)^p\\ge n$$ for any $p\\ge1$.\n\nThis captures all the necessary conditions and the problem statement as given.",
