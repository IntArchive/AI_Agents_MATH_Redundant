    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a proof more elementary. Let $c=f(0)$, we have to prove that $f(x)=c$ whenever $x\\neq0$. Supposing that $n$ is an arbitrary positive integer, we have\n$$\\left|f\\left(\\frac{m+1}nx\\right)-f\\left(\\frac mnx\\right)\\right|\\le\\left(\\frac{m+1}nx-\\frac mnx\\right)^2=\\frac{x^2}{n^2}$$\nHence\n\\begin{align*}\n|f(x)-f(0)|\n\\;&=\\;\\left|\\,\\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\\left(f\\left(\\frac{m+1}nx\\right)-f\\left(\\frac mnx\\right)\\right)\\,\\right|\\\\\n&\\le\\;\\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\\,\\left|f\\left(\\frac{m+1}nx\\right)-f\\left(\\frac mnx\\right)\\right|\\\\\n&\\le\\;\\frac{x^2}n\n\\end{align*}\nLet $n\\to\\infty$, we have $|f(x)-f(0)|=0$, thus $f(x)=c$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read a Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and structure it into the specified format. The example provided helps, so I need to follow that closely.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that a function f is constant given that the absolute difference between f(x) and f(y) is less than or equal to (x - y)^2 for all real x and y. The source is Rudin's PMA Chapter 5, exercise 1.\n\nThe task is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the example: The original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, maybe that example was a modified version? Wait, the user's example shows that in the original problem, the number A(n) is to be proven divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Maybe the original problem had a different set of assumptions and the formatted problem clarified them. But maybe in the example, the user made a mistake. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the example is correct. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem states: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. That seems conflicting. Maybe the example was incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to show how to structure even if the original problem has a missing assumption. Wait, maybe the original problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the user's example misrepresented it. Alternatively, perhaps the example is correct, and the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the task is to structure the given problem into assumptions and problem statement as per the format.\n\nSo, the current problem is from Rudin: Let f be defined for all real x, and suppose |f(x) - f(y)| ≤ (x - y)^2 for all real x and y. Prove f is constant.\n\nThe assumptions here would be:\n\n1. f is defined for all real numbers x.\n2. For all real numbers x and y, |f(x) - f(y)| ≤ (x - y)^2.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines. The problem is to prove f is constant.\n\nSo the formatted version should list each assumption on separate lines. The problem statement is to prove f is constant.\n\nI don't see any other assumptions here. The problem doesn't mention differentiability or continuity, but those might be conclusions from the given condition. The key assumptions are that f is defined on all real numbers and that the inequality holds for all real x and y.",
