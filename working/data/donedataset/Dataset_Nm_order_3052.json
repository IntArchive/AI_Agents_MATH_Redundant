    "AcceptedAnswer": "The inequality does not hold. Take\n$$\nf(x) = x^3 - x^2\n$$\nwe have\n$$\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2x \\\\\nf''(x) = 6x - 2 \\\\\nf(0) = f(1) = f'(0) = 0 \\\\\nf'(1) = 1\n$$\nBut\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\lvert f''(x)\\rvert dx = \\int_0^{1/3} (2 - 6x) dx + \\int_{1/3}^1 (6x - 2)dx = 1/3 + 4/3 = 5/3 < 4\n$$ Then, what can we say about the infimum of that integral?\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\lvert f''(x) \\rvert dx \\geq \\int_0^1 f''(x) dx = f'(1) - f'(0) = 1\n$$\nTo show that $1$ is the best lower bound, choose a $C^2$ function $h$ defined on $[0, 1/2]$ such that\n$$\nh(0) = h'(0) = h'(1/2) = h''(1/2) = 0 \\\\\nh(1/2) = -1\n$$\nUsing the above function we can construct the map\n$$\nf(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nkh(x) & \\text{if }0\\leq x \\leq 1/2 \\\\\n-k & \\text{if }1/2 < x \\leq 1 - 3k \\\\\n\\frac {(x - 1 +3k)^3}{27k^2} - k & \\text{if }1 - 3k < x \\leq 1 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a positive constant lesser than $1/6$. $f$ satisfies all the constraints and\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\lvert f''(x) \\rvert dx = 1 + k\\int_0^{1/2} \\lvert h''(x) \\rvert dx\n$$\nChoosing $k$ small enough we can make the integral as close to $1$ as we want.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided involved breaking down assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the problem from Math Stack Exchange. The title is \"Prove that ∫₀¹ |f''(x)| dx ≥ 4.\" The question states: Let f be a C² function on [0,1]. The conditions given are f(0) = f(1) = f'(0) = 0, and f'(1) = 1. We need to prove that the integral of |f''(x)| from 0 to 1 is at least 4 and determine the functions when equality holds.\n\nNow, I have to list the assumptions one by line, each for a single property of a single object. Let's parse the given conditions:\n\n1. The function f is in C² on [0,1]. That means f is twice continuously differentiable on the interval. So that's one assumption about f's differentiability.\n\n2. f(0) = 0. This is a boundary condition at x=0.\n\n3. f(1) = 0. Another boundary condition at x=1.\n\n4. f'(0) = 0. The first derivative at x=0 is zero.\n\n5. f'(1) = 1. The first derivative at x=1 is one.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to f or its derivatives at specific points. The problem is to prove the integral of |f''(x)| dx is at least 4 and characterize equality cases.\n\nWait, the original example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the example given by the user had the original problem stating \"for every integer n,\" but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, no, actually looking back: in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake? Wait, maybe the user's example might have an error. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption was for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an extra condition. That might be an error in the example. But maybe I need to follow the user's example structure regardless. However, in the current problem, the user probably wants to list all the given conditions as assumptions.\n\nSo, in the current problem, the given conditions are:\n\n- f is C² on [0,1].\n\n- f(0) = 0.\n\n- f(1) = 0.\n\n- f'(0) = 0.\n\n- f'(1) = 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove ∫₀¹ |f''(x)| dx ≥4 and determine equality cases.\n\nSo, structuring that into the required format:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is a C² function on [0,1].\n\n- f(0) = 0.\n\n- f(1) = 0.\n\n- f’(0) = 0.\n\n- f’(1) = 1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that ∫₀¹ |f''(x)| dx ≥ 4 and determine all possible f when equality occurs.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is on a separate line and addresses only one property. The C² condition is one line. Each boundary condition is separate. That should be correct.\n\nWait, in the example, the user included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example? But maybe in their example, they intended to filter out unrelated information, but the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7×13, so perhaps they split the problem into when n is divisible by 7 and then another part? Hmm, not sure. But regardless, in the current problem, all the conditions given are to be listed as assumptions.\n\nSo, the answer should list all the given conditions as separate assumptions. Then the problem is as stated. That's how I should format it.",
