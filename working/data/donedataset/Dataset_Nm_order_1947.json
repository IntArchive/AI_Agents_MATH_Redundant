    "Content": "Let $\\lambda$ be a partition of length $n$ and suppose its largest diagonal block, the Durfee square of $\\lambda$, has size $r$. By this I mean that $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n)$ is a non-increasing sequence of numbers, which I depict by the following diagram \\begin{align*}\n&\\square \\cdots \\square \\square \\quad (\\lambda_1 \\text{ squares })\\\\\n&\\square  \\cdots \\square \\quad (\\lambda_2 \\text{ squares }) \\\\\n&\\quad\\vdots \\\\\n&\\square \\quad(\\lambda_n \\text{ squares })\n\\end{align*} and the largest $i\\times i$ block one can fit to the topmost left is of size $r\\times r$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is given by reflecting the drawing above along the diagonal. If $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$ denote the\nsequence of numbers of blocks to the right of the diagonal in the $i$th row, and below the diagonal in the $i$th column, we write $\\lambda = (\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_r\\mid \\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_r)$. For example, for the partition $(5,4,2,1,1)$ has diagram\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&\\blacksquare\\square\\square\\square\\square\\\\\n&\\square\\blacksquare\\square\\square\\\\\n&\\square\\square\\\\\n&\\square\\\\\n&\\square\n\\end{align}\n$$ and its conjugate is $(5,3,2,2,1)$. Its diagonal has length $2$, and in Frobenius notation we have $\\lambda = (4,2\\mid 4,1)$. How can one show that the numbers $\\lambda_1',\\lambda_2'-1,\\ldots,\\lambda_r'-r+1,r+1-\\lambda_{r+1},\\ldots,n-\\lambda_n$ form a permutation of $1,\\ldots,n$? If $\\lambda = (\\alpha\\mid \\beta)$ in Frobenius notation, this is equivalent to the identity\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n t^i (1-t^{-\\lambda_i}) = \\sum_{j=1}^r (t^{\\beta_j+1}-t^{-\\alpha_j})$$\nwhich is Example 4 in page 11 of MacDonald's Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials , which he states without proof, so presumably this is easy. Continuing with the example, we compute that the sequence for $\\lambda = (5,4,2,1,1)$ is\n$$5,3-1,3-2,4-1,5-1=5,2,1,3,4$$\na permutation of $1,2,3,4,5$. \nIn $(1.7)$ MacDonald proves that if we take $m\\geqslant \\lambda_1$ and $n\\geqslant\\lambda_1'$ then the numbers\n$$\\lambda_i+n-i,1\\leqslant i\\leqslant n,\\quad n-1+j-\\lambda_j',1\\leqslant j\\leqslant m$$ are a permutation of $0,\\ldots,m+n-1$ by labelling the vertical and horizontal edge-lines on the diagram of $\\lambda$ fitted inside the diagram of $(m^n)$, but I haven't been able to come up with a proof similar to this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The concept here, although I'm not sure how far I can formalise it, is to extend the diagonal as far as the bottom of the Ferrers diagram. Then consider only the lower triangle. So your example $$\\begin{align}\n&\\blacksquare\\square\\square\\square\\square\\\\\n&\\square\\blacksquare\\square\\square\\\\\n&\\square\\square\\\\\n&\\square\\\\\n&\\square\n\\end{align}$$ becomes $$\\begin{align}\n&\\blacksquare\\\\\n&\\blacksquare\\blacksquare\\\\\n&\\blacksquare\\blacksquare\\square\\\\\n&\\blacksquare\\square\\square\\square\\\\\n&\\blacksquare\\square\\square\\square\\square\n\\end{align}$$ where $\\blacksquare$s were in the original Ferrers diagram and $\\square$s were not. Now the elements $\\lambda_1',\\lambda_2'-1,\\ldots,\\lambda_r'-(r-1)$ correspond to vertical lines of $\\blacksquare$ and the elements $r+1-\\lambda_{r+1},\\ldots,n-\\lambda_n$ correspond to horizontal lines of $\\square$. We can extract the permutation by considering the bottom-left space: if it is in the Ferrers diagram then we remove the left edge, which is a vertical line of $\\blacksquare$; otherwise we remove the bottom edge, which is a horizontal line of $\\square$. We then repeat on the resulting triangle, whose edge size has been reduced by one, until we have nothing left.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user is asking to show that a certain sequence of numbers formed from a partition's conjugate and its Frobenius notation results in a permutation of 1 through n. \n\nFirst, the problem mentions a partition λ with Durfee square size r. The conjugate partition is λ', and in Frobenius notation, λ is written as (α₁,…,α_r | β₁,…,β_r). The goal is to prove that the numbers λ₁', λ₂' -1, ..., λ_r' - r +1, r+1 - λ_{r+1}, ..., n - λ_n form a permutation of 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nLet me start by recalling some partition concepts. The Durfee square is the largest square of boxes starting from the top-left corner of the Young diagram. The Frobenius notation (α | β) represents the partition by counting the number of boxes to the right of the Durfee square in each row (the α's) and the number of boxes below the Durfee square in each column (the β's). \n\nGiven that λ has length n (i.e., has n parts, possibly including zeros if necessary?), but partitions are usually considered as non-increasing sequences, so maybe n is the number of non-zero parts? Wait, the problem states λ is a partition of length n, so it has exactly n parts, some of which might be zero. But typically, partitions are written without trailing zeros. Hmm, maybe the user is considering partitions with exactly n parts, allowing zeros? Not sure, but perhaps that's an assumption to note.\n\nWait, the problem says \"length n\", which in partition terminology usually refers to the number of non-zero parts. But sometimes \"length\" can mean the number of parts, including zeros. But given that the Durfee square is of size r, which is the largest i where λ_i ≥ i. So the Durfee square size r is such that r is the largest integer where the first r rows each have at least r boxes. \n\nThe example given is λ = (5,4,2,1,1), which has a Durfee square of size 2. So in this case, n=5. The conjugate partition is (5,3,2,2,1). Then, the sequence constructed is λ₁' =5, λ₂' -1 =3-1=2, then λ₃' -2=2-2=0, but wait the problem mentions up to λ_r' - r +1. Since r=2 in the example, maybe the sequence is λ₁', λ₂' -1, then r+1 - λ_{r+1} etc. Wait, in the example, after the Durfee square size r=2, they take the first r terms from the conjugate, subtract 0,1,...,r-1 respectively, and then for the remaining n - r terms, they take (r+1) - λ_{r+1}, up to n - λ_n. Wait, in the example, the remaining parts are from position r+1=3 to n=5. So the terms are 3+1 - λ_3=4-2=2? Wait, but in the example, they compute 5,3-1,3-2,4-1,5-1=5,2,1,3,4. Wait, the original partition is (5,4,2,1,1). The conjugate is (5,3,2,2,1). Then λ'_1 =5, λ'_2=3, λ'_3=2, λ'_4=2, λ'_5=1. But r=2 (Durfee square size). So the first part of the sequence is λ'_1, λ'_2 -1, which gives 5, 3-1=2. Then the next parts are r+1 - λ_{r+1} = 3 - λ_3. Here, λ_3=2, so 3-2=1. Then 4 - λ_4=4-1=3, and 5 - λ_5=5-1=4. So the sequence is 5,2,1,3,4 which is a permutation of 1-5. \n\nSo the problem is to show that for any partition λ of length n with Durfee square size r, the numbers constructed as λ'_1, λ'_2 -1, ..., λ'_r - (r-1), (r+1) - λ_{r+1}, ..., n - λ_n form a permutation of 1 to n.\n\nAssumptions here would include:\n\n- λ is a partition of length n, meaning it has exactly n parts, possibly including zeros, but arranged in non-increasing order.\n\n- The Durfee square of λ has size r, so r is the largest integer such that λ_i ≥ i for 1 ≤ i ≤ r.\n\n- The conjugate partition λ' is obtained by reflecting the Young diagram along the diagonal, so λ'_i is the number of boxes in the i-th column of λ.\n\n- The Frobenius notation of λ is (α_1,...,α_r | β_1,...,β_r), where α_i = number of boxes to the right of the Durfee square in row i, and β_i = number of boxes below the Durfee square in column i.\n\n- The problem statement refers to constructing the sequence from both the conjugate partition and the original partition's parts beyond the Durfee square.\n\nPossible assumptions to list:\n\n1. λ is a partition of length n, i.e., a non-increasing sequence of non-negative integers with exactly n parts.\n2. The Durfee square of λ has size r, meaning λ_i ≥ i for 1 ≤ i ≤ r and λ_{r+1} < r+1 (if r < n).\n3. The conjugate partition λ' is defined by reflecting the Young diagram of λ along the main diagonal.\n4. In Frobenius notation, λ is expressed as (α_1,…,α_r | β_1,…,β_r), where α_i = λ_i - r and β_i = λ'_i - r for 1 ≤ i ≤ r.\n5. The sequence to be considered is constructed as follows:\n   - For the first r terms: λ'_1, λ'_2 - 1, ..., λ'_r - (r - 1).\n   - For the remaining n - r terms: (r + 1) - λ_{r + 1}, ..., n - λ_n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the remaining terms after r=2 are positions 3 to n=5. The original partition's parts are λ_3=2, λ_4=1, λ_5=1. So the terms are (r+1) - λ_{r+1} = 3 - 2 =1, then 4 - λ_4=3, 5 - λ_5=4. Wait, but (r+1) - λ_{r+1} would be (2+1) - λ_3=3 -2=1, then 4 - λ_4=3, 5 -λ_5=4. So the general formula for the remaining terms (positions r+1 to n) is (r + k) - λ_{r + k} where k ranges from 1 to n - r? Wait, let's see: for the first remaining term, it's position r+1: (r+1) - λ_{r+1}, then position r+2: (r+2) - λ_{r+2}, up to position n: n - λ_n. So yes, for i from r+1 to n, the term is i - λ_i. But in the problem statement, the user writes \"r+1 - λ_{r+1}, ..., n - λ_n\". So the assumption would be that for each i from r+1 to n, the term is i - λ_i. However, λ_{r+1} < r+1 (since Durfee square is size r), so these terms are positive integers. \n\nSimilarly, for the conjugate partition terms: λ'_1, λ'_2 -1, ..., λ'_r - (r-1). Each λ'_i is the number of boxes in column i of λ. For the first r columns, since the Durfee square is size r, each of these columns has at least r boxes. Hence, λ'_i ≥ r for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. But in the conjugate partition, the parts are non-increasing, so λ'_1 ≥ λ'_2 ≥ ... ≥ λ'_r ≥ ... ≥ λ'_n. When we subtract 0,1,...,r-1 from λ'_1, ..., λ'_r respectively, we get λ'_1, λ'_2 -1, ..., λ'_r - (r-1). These need to be numbers between 1 and n, and not overlapping with the other terms.\n\nThus, the assumptions to list:\n\nAssumption:\n- λ is a partition of length n, i.e., a non-increasing sequence of non-negative integers with exactly n parts.\n- The Durfee square of λ has size r, meaning λ_i ≥ i for 1 ≤ i ≤ r and λ_{r+1} ≤ r (if r < n).\n- The conjugate partition λ' is obtained by reflecting λ's Young diagram along the main diagonal.\n- For 1 ≤ i ≤ r, α_i = λ_i - r and β_i = λ'_i - r are the number of boxes to the right and below the Durfee square in row i and column i, respectively.\n- The sequence in question is formed by the first r terms: λ'_1, λ'_2 -1, ..., λ'_r - (r - 1), followed by the remaining n - r terms: (r + 1) - λ_{r + 1}, ..., n - λ_n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the remaining terms are (r +1) - λ_{r+1} up to n - λ_n. For r=2, those are 3 - λ_3, 4 - λ_4, 5 - λ_5. Which is the same as i - λ_i for i from r+1 to n. So the assumption is that for the remaining n - r terms, each term is i - λ_i where i ranges from r+1 to n. \n\nAdditionally, since λ is a partition of length n, each λ_i is non-increasing. The Durfee square condition implies that for 1 ≤ i ≤ r, λ_i ≥ i, and for i > r, λ_i ≤ r (since otherwise the Durfee square would be larger). Wait, no: Durfee square is the largest r such that λ_r ≥ r. So for i > r, λ_i < i. But since λ is non-increasing, λ_{r+1} ≤ λ_r ≤ r, so λ_{r+1} ≤ r. But since for i > r, λ_i < i. Wait, no: if Durfee square is size r, then λ_r ≥ r, but λ_{r+1} < r+1. However, since the partition is non-increasing, λ_{r+1} ≤ λ_r. But λ_r ≥ r, so λ_{r+1} could be ≥ r or < r. For example, in the given example, λ = (5,4,2,1,1). Durfee square r=2 since λ_2=4 ≥ 2, but λ_3=2 < 3. So in this case, λ_{r+1}=λ_3=2 < 3. So perhaps the Durfee square condition is that λ_i ≥ i for i=1,...,r, and λ_{r+1} < r+1. Thus, the parts after the Durfee square (i > r) have λ_i < i. Therefore, for i > r, i - λ_i ≥ 1 (since λ_i < i). Similarly, for the first r terms, λ'_i - (i -1) ≥ 1, because λ'_i ≥ r (since in the conjugate partition, the first r columns each have at least r boxes due to the Durfee square). Wait, λ'_i is the number of boxes in column i of λ. For i ≤ r, since the Durfee square is r, column i has at least r boxes. Therefore, λ'_i ≥ r. Therefore, λ'_i - (i -1) ≥ r - (i -1). Since i ≤ r, the minimum value of r - (i -1) occurs when i = r: r - (r -1) =1. Thus, each term λ'_i - (i -1) ≥1. Similarly, the terms from i = r+1 to n: i - λ_i ≥1 because λ_i < i. So all terms are ≥1. Also, since the maximum possible λ'_i for i ≤ r is n (if the column has all n rows), but since the partition is of length n, λ'_i ≤ n. So λ'_i - (i -1) ≤n -0= n. Similarly, for terms i - λ_i where i ≥ r+1, since λ_i ≥0, the maximum is i -0 =i ≤n. So all terms are between 1 and n. Now, to show they form a permutation, we need that they are all distinct and cover 1 to n.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions would include the definition of Durfee square, the structure of the partition and its conjugate, the construction of the sequence from both the conjugate and original partition parts beyond the Durfee square, and the conditions that ensure each term is in 1 to n. Also, the Frobenius notation relation (α | β) where α_i = λ_i - r and β_i = λ'_i - r.\n\nSo compiling the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- λ is a partition of length n, i.e., a non-increasing sequence of non-negative integers (λ₁ ≥ λ₂ ≥ … ≥ λₙ).\n- The Durfee square of λ has size r, meaning λ_i ≥ i for each 1 ≤ i ≤ r and λ_{r+1} < r+1 (if r < n).\n- The conjugate partition λ' is obtained by transposing the Young diagram of λ, resulting in another non-increasing sequence.\n- In Frobenius notation, λ is expressed as (α₁,…,α_r | β₁,…,β_r) where α_i = λ_i - r and β_i = λ'_i - r for 1 ≤ i ≤ r.\n- The sequence to be considered is constructed as:\n  - For 1 ≤ i ≤ r: λ'_i - (i - 1).\n  - For r+1 ≤ j ≤ n: j - λ_j.\n- The problem requires proving that this sequence is a permutation of the integers 1 through n.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sequence is written as λ₁', λ₂' -1, ..., λ_r' - r+1, r+1 - λ_{r+1}, ..., n - λ_n. So yes, that matches the construction.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should capture each of these points concisely. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nFinalizing the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- λ is a partition of length n (non-increasing sequence with n parts).\n- The Durfee square of λ has size r (λ_i ≥ i for 1 ≤ i ≤ r, and λ_{r+1} < r+1 if r < n).\n- λ' is the conjugate partition of λ.\n- For 1 ≤ i ≤ r, α_i = λ_i - r and β_i = λ'_i - r.\n- The sequence is formed by terms λ'_i - (i - 1) for 1 ≤ i ≤ r and j - λ_j for r+1 ≤ j ≤ n.\n\nProblem remains as stated: to show this sequence is a permutation of 1, ..., n.",
