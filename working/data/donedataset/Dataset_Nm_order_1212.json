    "Content": "I am trying to prove this statement in the characteristic $p>0$ case. Every algebraic extension of a perfect field is separable and perfect. This is stated as a corollary of Proposition V.6.11 in Lang. Let $k$ be a field and let $K$ be a normal extension of $k$. Let $G$ be the group of automorphisms of $K$ that fix $k$. Let $K^G$ be the fixed field of $G$ acting on $K$, and $K_0$ the maximal separable subextension of $K$. Then $K^G$ is purely inseparable over $k$, $K$ is separable over $K^G$, $K_0\\cap K^G =k$  and $K_0K^G=K$. Lang doesn't write many details in the proof except that every finite extension is contained in a normal extension. This is what I have so far. Suppose, $k=k^p$. Let $E$ be an algebraic extension of $k$. Let $\\alpha \\in E$. Now, $\\alpha$ is contained in the field, say $K$ generated by the roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $k$ (and is hence normal as it's the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$). At this point, I don't know how to proceed. I am tempted to use the Frobenius map, but it does not fix every element of $k$ although it does stabilize it in this perfect case. Any hints will be appreciated. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is how the claim follows from Lang Proposition V.6.11: Suppose $k=k^p$. Let $E/k$ be any algebraic extension, let $\\alpha\\in E$, and let $K/k$ be the finite normal extension generated by $\\alpha$ and its conjugates (not necessarily contained inside $E$, of course). To prove that $E/k$ is separable, it suffices to prove that $k(\\alpha)/k$ is separable for all $\\alpha$, and to do this it suffices to prove that $K/k$ is separable for all $\\alpha$ (because $K\\supseteq k(\\alpha)$). (You already had this part :)) Let $K/k$ be our finite normal extension. By the proposition, $K=K^GK_0$ and $K^G\\cap K_0=k$, and $K^G/k$ is purely inseparable, and $K_0/k$ is separable. This means that for every $\\beta\\in K^G$, the minimal polynomial for $\\beta$ over $k$ is of the form $x^{p^n}-b$ for some $b\\in k$ (see Lang's definition of purely inseparable). But because the Frobenius map is surjective on $k$, there is some $c\\in k$ such that $c^{p^n}=b$. Hence the minimal polynomial for $\\beta$ is \n$$x^{p^n}-b=x^{p^n}-c^{p^n}=(x-c)^{p^n}$$\nso that $\\beta=c\\in k$. Thus $K^G=k$, so that $K=K^GK_0=K_0$ is separable over $k$. EDIT: See Matt E's answer for an explanation of why $K$ is perfect (and a more enlightening, comprehensive discussion of the whole situation than my answer, certainly). Original answer: I take the definition of a perfect field to be one for which every algebraic extension is separable. Suppose $K$ is a perfect field and $L/K$ is an algebraic extension. For any algebraic extension $F/L$, the extension $F/K$ is also algebraic, hence separable because $K$ is perfect. But this implies that $F/L$ is separable (because for any $\\alpha\\in F$, we have that $\\text{Irr}(\\alpha,L)\\mid \\text{Irr}(\\alpha,K)$, and $F/K$ separable $\\implies$ $\\text{Irr}(\\alpha,K)$ has no repeated roots, which therefore implies that $\\text{Irr}(\\alpha,L)$ doesn't either). Hence any algebraic extension of $L$ is separable, so $L$ is perfect. Finally, $L/K$ is separable, of course, because $K$ is perfect.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and present the assumptions and problem as in the example.\n\nFirst, the original problem's title is \"Every algebraic extension of a perfect field is separable and perfect.\" The user is focusing on the characteristic p>0 case. The goal is to prove that every algebraic extension of a perfect field is both separable and perfect. \n\nLooking at the question details, the user mentions Lang's Proposition V.6.11, which involves normal extensions, the group of automorphisms fixing k, the fixed field K^G, and the maximal separable subextension K0. They mention that Lang's proof is brief, stating every finite extension is contained in a normal extension. The user's attempt starts by assuming k = k^p (since it's perfect), taking an algebraic extension E of k, and an element α in E. They consider the field K generated by the roots of α's minimal polynomial over k, which is normal (a splitting field). They're stuck on proceeding further, thinking about using the Frobenius map but note it stabilizes k without fixing all elements.\n\nNow, to structure this into assumptions and problem. The key assumptions here relate to the properties of the fields involved. The main assumption is that the base field k is perfect, which in characteristic p>0 means k = k^p. The problem is to prove that any algebraic extension of this perfect field k is both separable and perfect.\n\nWait, the problem statement is about proving two properties: separability and perfectness of every algebraic extension. But in the example provided, the problem was a single statement. However, the original problem here has two parts: proving the extension is separable and perfect. Should both be included in the problem line?\n\nLooking back at the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, the problem is to prove that every algebraic extension of a perfect field is separable and perfect. The assumptions would include the conditions given, such as characteristic p>0, k being perfect (k = k^p), and that we're dealing with algebraic extensions. However, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions might be:\n\n- k is a perfect field.\n- The characteristic of k is p > 0.\n- E is an algebraic extension of k.\n- The problem is to prove E is separable over k.\n- And also to prove E is perfect.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"every algebraic extension of a perfect field is separable and perfect.\" So the main assumptions are that k is perfect, and E is an algebraic extension of k. The characteristic is p>0 because perfect fields in characteristic 0 are already separable, so the problem is non-trivial in positive characteristic. However, the user specifically mentions they are working in the characteristic p>0 case. So maybe the assumptions should include that k is a perfect field of characteristic p>0, and E is an algebraic extension of k. The problem is to prove E is both separable and perfect.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumptions:\n- k is a perfect field.\n- The characteristic of k is p > 0.\n- E is an algebraic extension of k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that E is separable over k and perfect.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"every algebraic extension of a perfect field is separable and perfect.\" So the problem is to show that under the given assumptions (k perfect, E algebraic over k), E is separable over k and E is perfect. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were specific to the problem. Here, perhaps the key assumption is that k is perfect. The characteristic p>0 is necessary because in characteristic 0, all extensions are separable, so the problem is only challenging in p>0. However, the problem statement may not require assuming p>0, since perfect fields in characteristic 0 are also a thing (they are automatically perfect), but the user is focusing on the p>0 case. The original question starts by saying \"I am trying to prove this statement in the characteristic p>0 case.\" So maybe the assumptions need to include that we're in characteristic p>0.\n\nSo combining:\n\nAssumptions:\n- k is a perfect field.\n- The characteristic of k is p > 0.\n- E is an algebraic extension of k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that E is separable over k and perfect.\n\nBut wait, the conclusion is that E is both separable over k and perfect. The separable part is about E being a separable extension of k, and perfect means E itself is a perfect field. So these are two separate conclusions. The problem statement in the example was a single divisibility, but here it's two properties. However, the original problem is stated as \"every algebraic extension of a perfect field is separable and perfect,\" so the problem is to prove both. The assumptions would be that k is perfect and E is an algebraic extension of k. However, the user is working in the case where characteristic is p>0, so that's an assumption as well because in the problem's general statement, k could be of any characteristic, but the user is focusing on p>0 where the non-trivial part lies.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should have assumptions:\n\n- k is a perfect field.\n- The characteristic of k is p > 0.\n- E is an algebraic extension of k.\n\nProblem: Prove that E is separable over k and that E is a perfect field.\n\nBut need to check if the problem's original statement includes the characteristic. The problem as stated in the title is general: \"Every algebraic extension of a perfect field is separable and perfect.\" But the user is working in the characteristic p>0 case. So perhaps the assumptions here should include that the field has characteristic p>0, as that's part of the context the user is considering. However, in the general statement, the field could be of any characteristic, but in characteristic 0, all extensions are separable, and perfect fields in characteristic 0 are just fields where every algebraic extension is separable. So to structure the problem as per the user's focus, we include the characteristic.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a perfect field,\nThe characteristic of k is p > 0,\nE is an algebraic extension of k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that E is separable over k and perfect.\n\nI think that's correct. The key assumptions are that k is perfect, characteristic p>0, and E is an algebraic extension. The problem is to show E is separable over k and E is perfect.",
