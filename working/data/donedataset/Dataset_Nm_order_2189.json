    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that the expression \n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{4 - 3\\sqrt[4]{5} + 2\\sqrt[4]{25} - \\sqrt[4]{125}}} - 1 \\right)^4 = 5\n$$\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The main challenge here is dealing with the complicated denominator inside the square root. The expression inside the square root is:\n\n$$\n4 - 3\\sqrt[4]{5} + 2\\sqrt[4]{25} - \\sqrt[4]{125}\n$$\n\nLet me denote the fourth roots in terms of exponents for simplicity. Remember that $\\sqrt[4]{5} = 5^{1/4}$, $\\sqrt[4]{25} = 25^{1/4} = 5^{2/4} = 5^{1/2}$, and $\\sqrt[4]{125} = 125^{1/4} = 5^{3/4}$. So substituting these back into the expression:\n\n$$\n4 - 3 \\cdot 5^{1/4} + 2 \\cdot 5^{1/2} - 5^{3/4}\n$$\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think—perhaps the expression inside the square root can be rewritten as a quadratic in terms of $5^{1/4}$. Let's let $x = 5^{1/4}$, so that $x^4 = 5$. Then:\n\n- $5^{1/4} = x$\n- $5^{1/2} = x^2$\n- $5^{3/4} = x^3$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression:\n\n$$\n4 - 3x + 2x^2 - x^3\n$$\n\nSo the denominator inside the square root becomes $\\sqrt{4 - 3x + 2x^2 - x^3}$. The original expression then is:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{4 - 3x + 2x^2 - x^3}} - 1 \\right)^4 = 5\n$$\n\nBut since $x = 5^{1/4}$, if we can show that the denominator simplifies in such a way that the entire left-hand side equals 5, that would prove the identity. Let me focus on simplifying the denominator first.\n\nLooking at the polynomial $4 - 3x + 2x^2 - x^3$, maybe it factors. Let's try to factor it. Let's write it as $-x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + 4$ or rearranged in descending powers. To factor a cubic polynomial, we can try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 4 over factors of 1 (since the leading coefficient is -1), so ±1, ±2, ±4. Let's test x=1:\n\n$-1 + 2 - 3 + 4 = (-1 + 2) + (-3 + 4) = 1 + 1 = 2 ≠ 0$\n\nx= -1:\n\n-(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 -3(-1) +4 = 1 + 2 + 3 +4 =10≠0\n\nx=2:\n\n-8 + 8 -6 +4= (-8+8) + (-6+4)=0 -2= -2≠0\n\nx=4:\n\n-64 + 32 -12 +4= (-64+32)= -32; (-12+4)= -8; total -40≠0\n\nHmm, none of the rational roots work. Maybe this polynomial doesn't factor nicely. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to $(x - something)^2$ or another form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire expression under the square root can be expressed as a square of some expression involving x. Let's assume that:\n\n$$\n4 - 3x + 2x^2 - x^3 = (a x^2 + b x + c)^2\n$$\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n$a^2 x^4 + 2ab x^3 + (2ac + b^2) x^2 + 2bc x + c^2$\n\nBut the left side is a cubic, which is degree 3. The right side is degree 4. So this approach might not work unless a=0. If a=0, then:\n\n$(0 x^2 + b x + c)^2 = b^2 x^2 + 2bc x + c^2$\n\nCompare with left side: cubic, but if a=0, then the right side is quadratic. So this doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe the expression inside the square root is a square of a term involving lower-degree radicals. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can be made.\n\nWait, another thought. Since we have x = 5^{1/4}, then x^4 =5. Maybe we can express the denominator in terms of x and use the relation x^4=5 to simplify.\n\nLet me write the denominator expression again:\n\n4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3\n\nLet me try to rearrange the terms:\n\n= -x^3 +2x^2 -3x +4\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can factor this. Maybe grouping terms:\n\nGroup as (-x^3 +2x^2) + (-3x +4)\n\nFactor out -x^2 from the first group: -x^2(x -2) and from the second group: -1*(3x -4). Doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write it as 4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3 = (something)(something else). Alternatively, consider possible connection to x^4=5. Maybe if we can write the denominator as a quadratic in x or x^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the denominator as a multiple of (x - something). But since x^4=5, maybe there's a connection here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the expression inside the square root might be related to (1 - x + x^2)^2 or something similar. Let's check:\n\n(1 -x +x^2)^2 = 1 -2x +3x^2 -2x^3 +x^4. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe (ax + b)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write 4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3 as (x^2 + a x + b)(c x + d) + e x^4. Since we know x^4=5, maybe that can help. Let's try.\n\nSuppose we write:\n\n-x^3 +2x^2 -3x +4 = (x^2 + a x + b)(c x + d) + e x^4\n\nBut x^4=5, so substituting that:\n\n= c x^3 + (d + a c) x^2 + (a d + b c) x + b d + e*5\n\nBut we need this to equal -x^3 +2x^2 -3x +4. Let's equate coefficients:\n\nFor x^3: c = -1\n\nFor x^2: d + a c = 2\n\nFor x: a d + b c = -3\n\nFor constant term: b d +5e =4\n\nBut c = -1, so:\n\nFrom x^2: d + a*(-1) =2 ⇒ d -a=2\n\nFrom x: a d + b*(-1) = -3 ⇒ a d -b = -3\n\nFrom constants: b d +5e =4\n\nThis system has variables a, b, d, e. Let's see if we can choose e such that this works. Let's assume e=0 first. Then:\n\nb d =4. Let's look for integer solutions.\n\nSuppose e=0. Then b d=4. Let's try possible integer pairs (b,d): (1,4),(2,2),(4,1),(-1,-4), etc.\n\nLet's try b=2, d=2. Then from d -a=2 ⇒ 2 -a=2 ⇒ a=0\n\nThen from a d -b=0*2 -2= -2 ≠ -3. Not good.\n\nTry b=4, d=1. Then d -a=2 ⇒1 -a=2 ⇒a= -1\n\nFrom a d -b= (-1)(1) -4= -1 -4= -5≠-3\n\nTry b=1, d=4. Then d -a=4 -a=2 ⇒a=2\n\nThen a d -b=2*4 -1=8 -1=7≠-3. No.\n\nTry b=-1, d=-4. Then d -a= -4 -a=2 ⇒a= -6\n\nThen a d -b= (-6)(-4) - (-1)=24 +1=25≠-3. Not good.\n\nIf e is non-zero, then perhaps 5e is part of the constants. Let's suppose e=1. Then b d +5=4 ⇒ b d= -1\n\nPossible b and d: (1,-1), (-1,1)\n\nTake b=1, d= -1:\n\nFrom d -a=2 ⇒-1 -a=2 ⇒a= -3\n\nFrom a d -b= (-3)(-1) -1=3 -1=2≠-3. No.\n\nTake b=-1, d=1:\n\nFrom d -a=1 -a=2 ⇒a= -1\n\nFrom a d -b= (-1)(1) - (-1)= -1 +1=0≠-3. Not working.\n\ne=2: b d +10=4 ⇒b d= -6. Possible pairs: (1,-6),(2,-3), etc.\n\nTake b=2, d=-3:\n\nFrom d -a= -3 -a=2 ⇒a= -5\n\nFrom a d -b= (-5)(-3) -2=15 -2=13≠-3. No.\n\nTake b=-3, d=2:\n\nFrom d -a=2 -a=2 ⇒a=0\n\nFrom a d -b=0*2 - (-3)=0 +3=3≠-3. No.\n\nThis approach might not be working. Maybe trying a different method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the denominator can be expressed in terms of (x -1) or another expression. Let me try plugging x=1 into 4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3. That gives 4 -3 +2 -1=2. Not zero.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that maybe the denominator is a perfect square. Suppose that:\n\n4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3 = (A + Bx + Cx^2)^2\n\nBut expanding the right side gives:\n\nA² + 2ABx + (2AC + B²)x² + 2BCx³ + C²x^4\n\nBut the left side is a cubic, and the right side has x^4 term. Since x^4=5, substitute that in:\n\n= A² + 2ABx + (2AC + B²)x² + 2BCx³ + C²*5\n\nNow equate coefficients with the left side: -x³ +2x² -3x +4\n\nSo:\n\nFor x³: 2BC = -1\n\nFor x²: 2AC + B² = 2\n\nFor x: 2AB = -3\n\nFor constant term: A² +5C² =4\n\nSo we have a system of equations:\n\n1. 2BC = -1\n\n2. 2AC + B² =2\n\n3. 2AB = -3\n\n4. A² +5C² =4\n\nThis looks complicated, but maybe we can solve it step by step.\n\nFrom equation 3: 2AB = -3 ⇒ AB= -3/2\n\nFrom equation 1: 2BC = -1 ⇒ BC= -1/2\n\nLet me express B from equation 3: B = -3/(2A)\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\nB*C= -1/2 ⇒ (-3/(2A)) * C = -1/2 ⇒ (3C)/(2A)=1/2 ⇒ 3C/A=1 ⇒ C= A/3\n\nNow, substitute B= -3/(2A) and C= A/3 into equation 2:\n\n2A*C + B² =2 ⇒ 2A*(A/3) + ( (-3/(2A)) )² =2 ⇒ (2A²)/3 + 9/(4A²) =2\n\nMultiply both sides by 12A² to eliminate denominators:\n\n12A²*(2A²/3) +12A²*(9/(4A²)) =24A^4/3 + 108/4 =8A^4 +27=24A^2\n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nMultiply each term:\n\n2A*(A/3) = (2A²)/3\n\nB² = (-3/(2A))²=9/(4A²)\n\nSo equation 2 becomes:\n\n(2A²)/3 +9/(4A²)=2\n\nMultiply both sides by 12A²:\n\n12A²*(2A²)/3 +12A²*(9)/(4A²) =2*12A²\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (12A²)*(2A²)/3 = (4A²)*(2A²) =8A^4\n\nSecond term: 12A²*(9)/(4A²)= (12/4)*9=3*9=27\n\nRight side:24A²\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n8A^4 +27 =24A²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n8A^4 -24A² +27=0\n\nLet me set y=A², then equation becomes:\n\n8y² -24y +27=0\n\nSolve for y:\n\nDiscriminant D=24² -4*8*27=576 -864= -288 <0\n\nUh-oh, discriminant is negative, so no real solutions. That means our assumption that the denominator is a perfect square of a quadratic in x with real coefficients is invalid. Hmm. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression inside the square root is a square of a term involving lower-degree radicals. Let's consider that perhaps the denominator is of the form (sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))^2 or something similar.\n\nLet me compute the numerical value of the denominator to see if it's a perfect square. Since x=5^{1/4}, approximate value:\n\n5^{1/4}=√(√5)≈√(2.236)≈1.495\n\nThen compute denominator:\n\n4 -3*(1.495) +2*(5^{1/2}) -5^{3/4}\n\nCompute each term:\n\n5^{1/2}=√5≈2.236\n\n5^{3/4}=5^{1/4}*5^{1/2}≈1.495*2.236≈3.346\n\nSo:\n\n4 -3*1.495 +2*2.236 -3.346≈4 -4.485 +4.472 -3.346≈\n\n4 -4.485= -0.485\n\n-0.485 +4.472=3.987\n\n3.987 -3.346≈0.641\n\nSo sqrt(0.641)≈0.8, then 2/0.8=2.5, subtract 1 gives 1.5, then 1.5^4=5.0625≈5. Hmm, close to 5, which matches the identity. So numerically, it works. But we need an exact proof.\n\nWait, but the problem says the left-hand side equals exactly 5. So maybe there's an exact expression.\n\nAnother approach: Let me set y = the expression inside the sqrt:\n\ny =4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3\n\nWe need to compute sqrt(y). Then compute 2/sqrt(y) -1, raise to the 4th power, and show it equals 5.\n\nLet me denote z =2/sqrt(y) -1\n\nWe need to show z^4=5.\n\nLet me express z +1 =2/sqrt(y) ⇒ sqrt(y)=2/(z +1) ⇒ y=4/(z +1)^2\n\nBut we need to relate y and z. Also, we know that x=5^{1/4}, so x^4=5. Maybe substitute z^4=5 into the equation.\n\nWait, if z^4=5, then z=5^{1/4}=x. But in the problem, z is defined as (2/sqrt(y) -1). So unless x and z are related in some way, this might not hold. Wait, but in the problem, z is (2/sqrt(y)-1), and we need to show that z^4=5. If x=5^{1/4}, maybe there's a substitution here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make a substitution t = sqrt(y). Then 2/t -1 = z, so t=2/(z+1). Then y=4/(z +1)^2. But y=4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3. So:\n\n4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3 =4/(z +1)^2\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe cross-multiplied:\n\n(z +1)^2*(4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3)=4\n\nBut x=5^{1/4}, z is supposed to be 5^{1/4} since z^4=5. Wait, if z^4=5, then z=5^{1/4}=x. So substituting z=x:\n\n(x +1)^2*(4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3)=4\n\nLet me check if this holds:\n\nCompute left side:\n\n(x +1)^2*(4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3)\n\nFirst expand (x +1)^2= x^2 +2x +1\n\nMultiply by ( -x^3 +2x^2 -3x +4 )\n\nLet me perform polynomial multiplication:\n\nMultiply x^2*(-x^3 +2x^2 -3x +4) = -x^5 +2x^4 -3x^3 +4x^2\n\nMultiply 2x*(-x^3 +2x^2 -3x +4)= -2x^4 +4x^3 -6x^2 +8x\n\nMultiply 1*(-x^3 +2x^2 -3x +4)= -x^3 +2x^2 -3x +4\n\nAdd them all together:\n\n- x^5 +2x^4 -3x^3 +4x^2\n\n-2x^4 +4x^3 -6x^2 +8x\n\n- x^3 +2x^2 -3x +4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- x^5\n\n+ (2x^4 -2x^4) =0\n\n+ (-3x^3 +4x^3 -x^3)=0\n\n+ (4x^2 -6x^2 +2x^2)=0\n\n+ (8x -3x)=5x\n\n+4\n\nSo total: -x^5 +5x +4\n\nBut x^4=5, so x^5= x*x^4=5x. Thus:\n\nLeft side= -5x +5x +4=4\n\nWhich equals the right side (4). So indeed, if z=x, then (x +1)^2*(4 -3x +2x^2 -x^3)=4, which holds true. Therefore, substituting back:\n\nWe have y=4/(x +1)^2 ⇒ sqrt(y)=2/(x +1)\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the problem:\n\n(2/sqrt(y) -1)= (2/(2/(x +1)) -1)= (x +1 -1)=x\n\nThus, the entire expression is x^4=5, which is exactly what we need to prove. Hence, the identity holds.\n\nSo the key steps were recognizing that substituting x=5^{1/4} simplifies the expression, then manipulating the polynomial inside the square root to show it relates to (x +1)^2, leading to the simplification.",
