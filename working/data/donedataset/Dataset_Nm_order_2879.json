    "Content": "I understand the proof of the identity in the title for $A$ Hermitian.

My motivation for this question is that in physics the identity is often used without it being clear that $A$ is Hermitian.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $\\ln(A) = B$, the identity says $$ \\det(\\exp(B)) = \\exp(\\text{Tr}(B)) $$ which is more usual form for this identity, true for all $n \\times n$ matrices $B$ over $\\mathbb C$ (avoiding questions about whether $\\ln(A)$ is defined, and which of the possible logarithms to use). One way to do this is to show it first for diagonalizable matrices $B$, then use the fact that diagonalizable matrices are dense and both sides of the equation are continuous functions of $B$. A second way is to use Jordan canonical form. A third way is to note that both $\\det(\\exp(tB))$ and $\\exp(t \\text{Tr}(B))$ satisfy the differential equation\n$y' = \\text{Tr}(B) y$ with initial value $y(0) = 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example they provided shows how to list assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is about proving the identity det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) for a general matrix A, not just Hermitian ones. The user mentions that they know the proof for Hermitian matrices using diagonalization, but they want to know if it's possible to show this identity when A is not Hermitian. The physics context is mentioned, where the identity is used without assuming Hermiticity.\n\nNow, I need to filter out the unnecessary information. The original question includes some details about the proof for Hermitian matrices, using diagonalization, but the key part is the extension to non-Hermitian matrices. The example given in the problem had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n is divisible by 7\". But here, the key assumptions would relate to the properties of matrix A.\n\nThe problem is to determine if the identity holds for non-Hermitian A. However, the identity involves the logarithm of a matrix, which requires A to be invertible (since log(A) needs to be defined). Also, even if A is diagonalizable, log(A) might not be straightforward if A has negative or complex eigenvalues. But the question doesn't specify any restrictions on A beyond being non-Hermitian. So the assumptions would likely be that A is a square matrix, possibly invertible, and that log(A) is defined. However, the original problem statement doesn't explicitly state these, so maybe I shouldn't add them unless they are implied.\n\nWait, the original proof uses the diagonalization for Hermitian matrices. For non-Hermitian, if the matrix is diagonalizable, then a similar approach might work. But not all matrices are diagonalizable. So maybe the assumption is that A is diagonalizable? But the user is asking in general, so perhaps the problem is to show the identity holds for any matrix A (not necessarily Hermitian) where log(A) is defined. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to check if the identity holds for general A, under certain conditions.\n\nThe user's problem is: \"is it possible to show the identity for A not Hermitian?\" So the problem is to prove or disprove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) for A not Hermitian. The assumptions would then be the conditions under which this identity is being considered. Since the original proof uses diagonalization, maybe the assumption here is that A is diagonalizable. But the user doesn't state that. Alternatively, since log(A) is used, we need A to be invertible and perhaps have a logarithm (which requires invertibility, as the matrix exponential is always invertible). So maybe the assumptions are that A is an invertible square matrix. But the question doesn't specify that. However, in order for ln(A) to make sense, A must be invertible, because the matrix logarithm isn't defined for singular matrices. So even though the user didn't mention it, it's an implicit assumption. But the user might not have considered that. However, when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions. The example included assumptions that were not all stated in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), but in that example, maybe the original problem had that condition. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they changed it to an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check.\n\nOriginal example: The problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would change the problem. But maybe in the original example, the user made an error. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me recheck.\n\nThe user provided an example where the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then, in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that would mean that the problem statement in the formatted version is now to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13. If n is divisible by 7, maybe the problem is easier. However, that seems like the example might be incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user's question is about extending the identity det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) to non-Hermitian A. The original proof uses that Hermitian matrices can be diagonalized, but the user wants to know about the non-Hermitian case.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\n- A is not Hermitian.\n\nBut maybe more precise assumptions are needed. However, since the original problem's proof uses diagonalization, perhaps the key assumption here is that A is diagonalizable. Because if A is diagonalizable, even if not Hermitian, then you can write A = XΛX^{-1}, and then maybe proceed similarly. However, the logarithm of a matrix is more complex. The logarithm of a matrix exists if the matrix is invertible and, in some cases, if it's diagonalizable with eigenvalues not on the negative real axis (to have a principal logarithm). But maybe the user is assuming that log(A) is defined. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\n- log(A) is defined (which implies A is invertible).\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking whether the identity holds for A not Hermitian. The problem is to show the identity for such A. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the necessary assumptions for the identity to hold, even if they aren't stated in the original question. But the user might have intended to keep the problem as general as possible, only changing the Hermitian condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that A is invertible (so log(A) exists), and the problem is to prove the identity for such matrices. However, in the example given by the user, assumptions were added that weren't in the original problem. So perhaps here, the assumption is that A is a square matrix (since determinant and trace are defined), and possibly invertible (for log(A) to exist). But the original question doesn't specify these, so perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: A is a square matrix.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) for A not necessarily Hermitian.\n\nBut that's too vague. Alternatively, the problem as stated in the original question is whether the identity holds for A not Hermitian. So the formatted problem should list the conditions under which this is being considered. For example, if A is diagonalizable, or invertible. However, since the user hasn't specified these in their question, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a complex square matrix.\n\n- log(A) is defined (i.e., A is invertible and has a logarithm).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the only assumption is that A is not Hermitian, but then log(A) needs to exist. Since in physics, they might use it without worrying about Hermiticity, perhaps assuming A is positive definite or something else. But the question doesn't specify. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\n- A is invertible.\n\n- log(A) is defined.\n\nBut I need to extract the assumptions from the original problem. The original problem states that the identity is proven for Hermitian A, and the user is asking about A not Hermitian. The user's problem is whether the identity holds in that case. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a matrix (square, as determinant and trace are involved).\n\n- A is not Hermitian.\n\nBut the original proof uses diagonalization, so maybe the assumption is that A is diagonalizable (even if not Hermitian). However, the user doesn't mention that. Alternatively, the problem is to consider general A (not necessarily diagonalizable or Hermitian). But the matrix logarithm is tricky in that case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key point is that the identity holds for any matrix where log(A) is defined, regardless of being Hermitian. But in that case, the assumption is that log(A) is defined, which requires A to be invertible. So perhaps the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\n- A is invertible.\n\n- log(A) is defined.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify these, so maybe the user is unaware of these conditions. Alternatively, since the user is asking in the context of physics where they might use it without checking Hermiticity, perhaps the problem is to determine under what conditions the identity holds for non-Hermitian A, but the user wants to know if the identity is generally true for non-Hermitian A. So the problem is as stated, with the assumption that A is not Hermitian. But then the answer would involve specifying the conditions under which the identity holds.\n\nBut according to the example, the user might have included assumptions that weren't in the original problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, changing the problem. That might have been an error in the example. Therefore, I should follow the user's instruction to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem based on the original question.\n\nThe original question is: \"is it possible to show the identity [det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))] for A not Hermitian?\" So the problem is to prove or explain whether this identity holds when A is not Hermitian. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- A is a matrix (square, as determinant and trace require square matrices).\n\n- The logarithm of A is defined (which implies A is invertible).\n\nBut the user didn't mention invertibility, so maybe that's an implicit assumption. The original proof for Hermitian matrices uses diagonalization, which requires A to be diagonalizable, but Hermitian matrices are always diagonalizable. For non-Hermitian matrices, diagonalizability isn't guaranteed. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A is diagonalizable.\n\n- A is invertible (so log(A) exists).\n\nBut the user's question doesn't state these, so maybe they should be listed as assumptions. However, since the user is asking about non-Hermitian A, the main assumption is that A is not Hermitian. However, to make the identity hold, additional assumptions are necessary. But the problem is as posed by the user: can the identity be shown for A not Hermitian, without additional constraints? Or under what conditions?\n\nIn the example given by the user, they transformed the original problem (for all integers n) into a problem with an added assumption (n divisible by 7). But that might be incorrect. Perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user wants us to extract assumptions from the original problem. In the current problem, the original question states that the identity is proven for Hermitian A, and the user is asking about non-Hermitian A. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions inherent in the question. The problem is to prove the identity for A not Hermitian. However, the user doesn't specify any other conditions, so maybe the only assumption is that A is a square matrix (since determinant and trace apply), and the problem is to prove the identity for non-Hermitian A. But actually, in the original problem, the user is asking whether it's possible, so the problem is \"Is it possible to show the identity det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) for A not Hermitian?\" But according to the example, the problem statement should be a statement to prove, not a question. The example changed \"Prove that for every integer n...\" to \"Prove that... is divisible by 91\" with added assumptions. So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) for A not Hermitian,\" but the user is asking whether it's possible. So maybe the problem is \"Determine whether the identity det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) holds for A not Hermitian.\" But the example uses \"Prove that...\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the problem restructured with necessary assumptions. For instance, if the identity holds when A is diagonalizable and invertible, then those would be the assumptions.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where the user added an assumption not present in the original problem (assuming n divisible by 7 when the original was for every integer n), which might have been a mistake, but in this case, perhaps the intended assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\n- A is not Hermitian.\n\nBut the key point is that the original proof uses Hermitian matrices, and the question is about extending it to non-Hermitian. So the formatted problem would have assumptions that A is a square matrix, and the problem is to prove the identity for such A.\n\nHowever, in reality, the identity det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) holds for any invertible matrix A where log(A) is defined. Because if A is diagonalizable, then even if not Hermitian, you can write A = XΛX^{-1}, and then ln(A) = X ln(Λ) X^{-1}, so Tr(ln(A)) = Tr(ln(Λ)) = sum ln(λ_i), and exp(sum ln(λ_i)) = product λ_i = det(A). But this requires that A is diagonalizable and that the logarithm is defined (i.e., no eigenvalues on the negative real axis if we're using the principal logarithm). But if A is not diagonalizable, then ln(A) might not be straightforward. However, in physics, they might be hand-wavy about such things.\n\nBut the problem is structured as per the user's instructions. So based on the original question, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\n- A is not Hermitian.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))).\n\nBut actually, the user is asking whether it's possible to show the identity for non-Hermitian A. So the problem is to determine if the identity holds when A is not Hermitian. However, in the example, the problem statement was changed from \"for every integer n\" to including an assumption that n is divisible by 7. If following that approach, perhaps here we need to specify the conditions under which the identity holds, even if the original question didn't state them. But since the original question is about non-Hermitian A, and the user is asking if the identity can be shown, the formatted problem would list the necessary assumptions for the identity to hold for non-Hermitian A. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\n- All eigenvalues of A are positive real numbers.\n\n- A is invertible.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))).\n\nBut the original question doesn't mention these; it's the answer that would require these conditions. However, the user's task is to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the original question and filtering unrelated info. The original question mentions that in physics, the identity is used without A being Hermitian. The user wants to know if the identity can be shown for non-Hermitian A. Therefore, the problem is to prove the identity for non-Hermitian A, with the assumptions being that A is a square matrix and not Hermitian. However, in reality, additional assumptions are needed, but the original question doesn't specify them. Therefore, the formatted problem would include the assumptions explicitly stated in the original question, which are that A is not Hermitian. The other assumptions (like invertible, diagonalizable) are part of the solution's conditions but aren't mentioned in the original question.\n\nBut the example provided by the user added an assumption not present in the original problem. For instance, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended to show how to structure even if modifying the problem. However, in this case, I should follow the user's example, even if it's incorrect. But the example might have been a mistake, so perhaps the user wants to extract assumptions from the original problem. In the original problem here, the key info is:\n\n- The identity is known for Hermitian A via diagonalization.\n\n- Question is about extending to non-Hermitian A.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a matrix.\n\n- A is not Hermitian.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))).\n\nBut this might be incomplete, as log(A) needs to be defined. However, the original question doesn't mention this, so the user might not have considered it. Therefore, following the example where assumptions were added (even if not in the original problem), maybe here we need to list the necessary assumptions for the identity to hold. For instance, A must be invertible and diagonalizable.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, I think the safest way is to structure it as:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\n- A is diagonalizable.\n\n- The logarithm of A is defined.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) for A not necessarily Hermitian.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is about whether it's possible to show the identity for non-Hermitian A, the problem is:\n\nProblem: Determine whether the identity det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) holds for A not Hermitian.\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the user wants it as a statement to prove, even if the original is a question. Given that, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\n- A is diagonalizable.\n\n- A is invertible.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))).\n\nBut the original question mentions \"A not Hermitian\". Therefore, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\n- A is not Hermitian.\n\n- A is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))).\n\nThis captures that A is diagonalizable and not Hermitian, but in the original proof, they used diagonalization for Hermitian matrices, which are always diagonalizable. So extending to diagonalizable non-Hermitian matrices. However, the user's question doesn't specify diagonalizable, but perhaps it's an implicit assumption in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, the key point is that the identity holds for any matrix where the logarithm is defined, regardless of being Hermitian. In that case, the assumption would be that A is invertible (so that log(A) exists), and the problem is to prove the identity.\n\nBut given the user's example, which added assumptions not in the original problem, I might need to infer necessary assumptions based on the problem's context. So, considering that log(A) must be defined, which requires A to be invertible, and if we want to use the same diagonalization approach, then A must be diagonalizable. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is invertible.\n\n- A is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) for A not necessarily Hermitian.\n\nBut the original question's context is physics, where they might use the identity without ensuring Hermiticity. So perhaps the answer is that it holds for invertible diagonalizable matrices, regardless of being Hermitian. Thus, the formatted problem would list those assumptions.\n\nBut since the user's task is to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem, I think the key elements from the original question are:\n\n- The identity is proven for Hermitian A via diagonalization.\n\n- The user asks about the case when A is not Hermitian.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would assume that A is diagonalizable (even if not Hermitian) and invertible (so that log(A) exists), leading to:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\n- A is invertible.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A)))).\n\nBut the user's original question doesn't mention diagonalizable or invertible, so perhaps these are implicit in the method used for Hermitian matrices. Since Hermitian matrices are always diagonalizable and have real eigenvalues, but for non-Hermitian, diagonalizability is not guaranteed. Therefore, to apply the same proof method, diagonalizability is needed. Hence, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is diagonalizable.\n\n- log(A) is defined (which requires invertibility and possibly other conditions on eigenvalues).\n\nBut again, the user didn't state these. However, the example provided by the user added an assumption (n divisible by 7) not present in the original problem, which suggests that perhaps we should include necessary assumptions even if not stated.\n\nTherefore, after considering all this, I'll structure the problem as follows:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\n- A is invertible.\n\n- log(A) is defined.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))) for A not necessarily Hermitian.\n\nBut to match the example's style, which lists each assumption line by line, addressing one property per line. So each assumption is a separate line:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a square matrix.\n\nA is diagonalizable.\n\nA is invertible.\n\nlog(A) is defined.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))).\n\nBut maybe \"A is invertible\" and \"log(A) is defined\" can be combined, but according to the example, each line is one condition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a square matrix.\n\nA is diagonalizable.\n\nA is invertible.\n\nlog(A) is defined.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A)))).\n\nHowever, \"log(A) is defined\" might be redundant if we already assume A is invertible and diagonalizable with eigenvalues not on the branch cut of the logarithm. But given the example's approach, listing each assumption separately, I'll include them.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal assumptions needed are that A is diagonalizable and invertible. Because if A is diagonalizable as A = XΛX^{-1}, and invertible (so Λ has non-zero eigenvalues), then ln(A) = X ln(Λ) X^{-1}, and Tr(ln(A)) = Tr(ln(Λ)) = sum ln(λ_i). Then exp(sum ln(λ_i)) = product λ_i = det(A). Therefore, the key assumptions are diagonalizable and invertible.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA is a square matrix.\n\nA is diagonalizable.\n\nA is invertible.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A))).\n\nThis captures the necessary conditions for the proof to follow similarly to the Hermitian case. The user's original question is about non-Hermitian A, so by including the diagonalizable and invertible assumptions, we're structuring the problem for that case.\n\nThus, the final answer should list these assumptions and the problem statement.",
