    "AcceptedAnswer": "Theorem .  If $2^n-1$ is prime then $n$ is prime. Proof .  Suppose that $2^n-1$ is prime, and write $n=st$ where $s,t$ are positive integers.  Since\n$$x^s-1=(x-1)(x^{s-1}+x^{s-2}+\\cdots+1)\\ ,$$\nwe can substitute $x=2^t$ to see that $2^t-1$ is a factor of $2^n-1$.  Since $2^n-1$ is prime there are only two possibilities,\n$$2^t-1=1\\quad\\hbox{or}\\quad 2^t-1=2^n-1\\ .$$\nTherefore $t=1$ or $t=n$.  We have shown that the only possible factorisations of $n$ are $n\\times1$ and $1\\times n$.  Hence, $n$ is prime. Comment .  If $n$ is prime it is not always true that $2^n-1$ is prime.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at the problem from the user. The question is about whether Mersenne prime exponents are always odd. The user noticed that when calculating Mersenne primes, the exponent n seems to be odd every time. They want to confirm if this is always true and if there's a proof for it.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The example provided lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement follows.\n\nSo, the original problem is: \"Are Mersenne prime exponents always odd?\" The user defines a Mersenne prime as 2^n - 1 and observed that n is always odd in such primes. They're asking for confirmation or proof.\n\nNow, let's parse the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. The number in question is a Mersenne prime, which is of the form 2^n - 1.\n2. The exponent n is such that 2^n - 1 is prime.\n3. The user is asking whether n must necessarily be odd.\n\nWait, but the original problem doesn't explicitly state any assumptions beyond the definition of Mersenne primes. The user is observing that exponents are odd and wants to know if that's a rule. So, perhaps the assumptions should include that we're dealing with a Mersenne prime, hence 2^n - 1 is prime. The problem then is to determine if n must be odd.\n\nBut the example given in the prompt for the previous problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". The user had added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nOriginal problem example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\"\n\nWait, that's adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user intended to filter out irrelevant information and restructure the problem. Maybe in that example, the problem was actually to prove divisibility by 91 under the condition that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was stated differently. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nBut moving back to the current problem. The user wants to structure the problem as per the format. The example might have been a case where the original problem had a general statement, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in that case, maybe the example was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the example's original problem had a typo, and the user intended to structure it differently.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem about Mersenne primes, the key is to list the assumptions. The assumptions here are:\n\n1. The number in question is a Mersenne prime, which is 2^n - 1.\n2. We need to determine the parity of n (whether it's odd).\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So the first assumption would be that the number is a Mersenne prime, i.e., of the form 2^n - 1. The second assumption might be that this number is prime. Wait, but a Mersenne prime is by definition a prime number of the form 2^p - 1 where p itself is prime. Wait, but the user's question is about the exponent n in 2^n - 1 being a prime. However, the definition of Mersenne primes is that they are primes of the form 2^p - 1 where p is a prime number. But the user's question is whether that exponent p must be odd. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n1. p is a prime number.\n2. 2^p - 1 is a prime number (i.e., a Mersenne prime).\n3. The problem is to prove that p is odd.\n\nWait, but the user didn't mention that p must be prime. Wait, the user wrote: \"A Mersenne prime looks like 2^n - 1.\" However, the actual definition requires that n itself is prime. Because if n is composite, say n=ab, then 2^ab - 1 factors into (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + ... + 1). So, 2^n - 1 can't be prime unless n is prime. Therefore, the exponent n in a Mersenne prime must itself be prime. So the user might be conflating the exponent being prime with it being odd, but the question is whether it's always odd.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here would be:\n\n- Let n be a positive integer such that 2^n - 1 is a Mersenne prime (i.e., prime).\n\nBut according to the problem's structure, the assumptions should be listed line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\n2^n - 1 is prime.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is odd.\n\nBut wait, the user's question is whether the exponents n are always odd. The answer is yes, except for n=2. Because if n is even and greater than 2, then n is composite (since the only even prime is 2), so 2^n -1 would be composite. However, if n=2, then 2^2 -1 =3, which is prime, and n=2 is even. Therefore, the only even exponent that gives a Mersenne prime is n=2, which is even. So the correct answer is that except for n=2, all Mersenne primes have odd exponents. Therefore, the problem as stated by the user is slightly incorrect, but they observed that the exponents \"always appear to be odd\", which is almost true except for n=2.\n\nBut the problem as structured would need to include the assumptions. However, the user's original problem didn't state any assumptions beyond the definition. So perhaps the structured problem should list the necessary assumptions.\n\nWait, the example given by the user in the original prompt might have had a mistake. Let me check that again. The example original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. Unless there was a miscommunication.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The key is that for a Mersenne prime 2^n -1, n must be prime. Now, primes except 2 are odd. Therefore, n must be prime, so if n is 2 (even), then 2^2 -1=3 is prime. Otherwise, primes are odd. Therefore, except for n=2, all Mersenne primes have exponents that are odd primes. Therefore, the answer is that except for n=2, all Mersenne prime exponents are odd. However, the user's question is whether the exponents are always odd. The answer is no, because n=2 is allowed. But perhaps the user's observation didn't include n=2, or they considered that as a special case.\n\nBut to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is odd.\n\nBut wait, that's not true because n=2 is even and 2^2 -1=3 is prime. So the correct problem statement would be to show that n is either 2 or odd. But the user's question is phrased as \"always odd\", so perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe the user's observation that exponents are always odd is because n=2 is the only even case, and maybe their program hasn't encountered it yet. But in reality, n=2 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the problem as structured should capture this. However, perhaps the original problem didn't mention that n must be prime. Wait, the user's question says: \"A Mersenne prime looks like 2^n -1\". But in reality, the definition is that a Mersenne prime is a prime of the form 2^p -1 where p is prime. So the exponent must be prime. Therefore, the user might be missing that the exponent itself must be prime. So, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a prime number,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is odd.\n\nBut here, since n is prime, except for n=2, all primes are odd. Therefore, the only even prime is 2, which would mean that n must be 2 or odd. Therefore, the problem would be to prove that if 2^n -1 is prime and n is prime, then n is either 2 or odd. But since 2 is even, the problem is to show that except for n=2, all such exponents are odd.\n\nBut the user's question is phrased as \"Are Mersenne prime exponents always odd?\" The answer is no, because 2 is even. However, the user might have observed that in known Mersenne primes, the exponents are odd. For example, the known Mersenne primes correspond to exponents like 3,5,7,13,..., which are all odd except for 2. But 2 is also a valid exponent. Therefore, the correct answer is that except for n=2, all Mersenne prime exponents are odd.\n\nBut the problem as structured should reflect this. However, in the format, the user wants the assumptions and problem. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a prime number,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either 2 or an odd prime.\n\nBut the original question is whether exponents are always odd, which would require n to be odd. However, since n=2 is a valid even exponent, the correct statement is that n must be 2 or odd. But the user's question is phrased as \"always odd\", which is incorrect. So perhaps the problem should be structured with the assumption that n is a prime number, and the problem is to determine whether n must be odd (with the answer being no, but under the constraints that n is prime, so n can be 2 or odd).\n\nBut given the user's example, where they restructured the problem possibly adding an assumption not present in the original, I need to follow that. However, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is incorrect. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the example is flawed, and I should focus on the current problem.\n\nSo, to correctly structure the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either 2 or an odd integer.\n\nBut perhaps the problem as posed by the user is simpler: they observed that exponents are odd and want to know if this is always the case. The answer is no, but for n=2, which is even. Therefore, the problem would be to determine if n must be odd when 2^n -1 is prime. The answer is no, but if n is even and greater than 2, then 2^n -1 is composite. Therefore, the only possible even exponent is 2.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either 2 or odd.\n\nBut the user's question is phrased as \"Are Mersenne prime exponents always odd?\" The answer is no, but the exponents are either 2 or odd. However, since the user's observation might not include n=2, they might think exponents are always odd. Therefore, the problem as structured should capture the essence of the user's question, which is whether exponents are always odd, given that 2^n -1 is prime.\n\nThus, the correct structure would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nIs n always odd?\n\nBut according to the example provided by the user, the assumptions should list each condition line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nIs n always odd?\n\nBut wait, the original problem in the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (adding n divisible by 7). So perhaps the correct approach here is to include all necessary assumptions from the problem statement. The user's original problem states that a Mersenne prime is 2^n -1, and they're asking if n is always odd. The definition of a Mersenne prime actually requires n to be a prime number. So perhaps the user is missing that part. Therefore, the assumptions should include that n is a prime number, because otherwise, if n is composite, 2^n -1 is also composite. Therefore, for 2^n -1 to be prime, n must be prime. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a prime number,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is odd.\n\nBut wait, since n=2 is a prime number and 2^2 -1=3 is prime, so n=2 is allowed. So the problem should be to show that n is either 2 or odd. But since 2 is even, the conclusion is that n is 2 or odd. Therefore, the problem would be to prove that if n is a prime number and 2^n -1 is prime, then n is either 2 or odd. But since all primes except 2 are odd, this is equivalent to saying that n is 2 or an odd prime.\n\nBut the user's question is phrased as \"Are Mersenne prime exponents always odd?\" The answer is no, because 2 is even. However, the user's observation might have been that all exponents they encountered were odd, perhaps because n=2 is the only even case and maybe they didn't check it, or it's considered trivial. Therefore, structuring the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a prime number,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is odd.\n\nBut this would be incorrect because n=2 is a valid case. Therefore, the correct problem should be to prove that n is either 2 or odd. But perhaps the user's question is based on the misunderstanding that Mersenne primes require the exponent to be prime, which is true, and among primes, only 2 is even, so all others are odd. Therefore, the problem could be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a prime number,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either 2 or an odd integer.\n\nBut to fit the format, perhaps list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a prime number,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is odd.\n\nEven though this is technically incorrect because n=2 is even. But maybe the user's original problem has a mistake, and the answer would correct that. However, according to the instructions, I should structure the problem as per the example, filtering unrelated information. The user's original question didn't mention that n must be prime, but in reality, that's part of the definition. So perhaps including that as an assumption is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the user's definition at face value (Mersenne prime is 2^n -1, without requiring n to be prime), then the problem is different. In that case, if n is even and greater than 2, 2^n -1 would be composite. For example, n=4: 2^4 -1=15, which is composite. So in that case, the only even n for which 2^n -1 is prime is n=2. Therefore, the problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is either 2 or odd.\n\nBut again, the user's question is whether exponents are always odd, which is not the case. Therefore, the problem as structured would have the answer that n is either 2 or odd, which means that the exponents are not always odd, but almost always except for n=2.\n\nHowever, the user's example in the original prompt had the formatted problem adding an assumption not present in the original problem. For instance, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the example is not a good guide, and the correct approach is to list the assumptions explicitly mentioned in the problem and any necessary implicit assumptions based on standard definitions.\n\nIn the case of Mersenne primes, the standard definition requires the exponent to be a prime number. Therefore, the user's problem might be missing this key point. Therefore, the assumptions should include that n is a prime number, and 2^n -1 is prime. The problem is to prove that n is odd.\n\nBut since n=2 is prime and leads to a Mersenne prime, the answer is no, but if we consider that the user might not be aware that n must be prime, the problem could be different.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. To sum up, the structured problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nIs n always odd?\n\nBut according to the standard definition, Mersenne primes have prime exponents, so perhaps the assumptions should include that n is prime. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a prime number,\n2^n -1 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nIs n always odd?\n\nBut even then, the answer is no because n=2 is valid. So the problem as structured would have the answer that no, n can be 2 (even) or any other prime (which are odd except for 2). Therefore, the correct answer is that all Mersenne prime exponents are odd except for n=2.\n\nBut the user's question is whether exponents are always odd, which would be false. However, the way the problem is structured here would require the assumptions and problem statement as above.",
