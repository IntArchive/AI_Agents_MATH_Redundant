    "Content": "Let $X$ be a reflexive Banach Space. Let $Y$ be a closed subspace of it.I need to show that $Y$ is reflexive as well. So as usual I consider the inclusion map $$J: Y \\to Y'', J(y)=j_{y}, j_{y}(y')=y'(y)$$, where $Y''$ denotes the bidual space of $Y$. I need to show that the map is onto because everything else is guaranteed (one-one and isometry) I pick an element say $y^{**} \\in Y''$, then define $\\tilde{y} \\in X''$ such that $\\tilde{y}(x')=y^{**}(x'|_{Y})$. Then it is well-defined, linear, continuous. Since $X$ is reflexive there is $x \\in X$ such that $j_{x}=\\tilde{y}$. Suppose that $x \\not \\in Y$. Then since $Y$ is closed, by Hahn-Banach theorem, there is $f:X \\to K$ such that $f(x)=1$ and $f|_{Y}=0$. Then $\\tilde{y}(f)=f(x)=1=y^{**}(0)=0$ which can't happen. Thus $x=y \\in Y$ I need to show that $j_{y}=y^{**}$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To show that $j_Yy = y^{**}$, let $y^* \\in Y'$ and $x^*\\in X'$ a Hahn-Banach extension of $y^*$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\n  (j_Yy)(y^*) &= y^*(y)\\\\\n            &= x^*(y)\\\\\n            &= j_Xx(x^*)\\\\\n            &= \\tilde y(x^*)\\\\\n            &= y^{**}(x^*|_Y)\\\\\n            &= y^{**}(y^*)\n\\end{align*}\nHence, $j_Yy = y^{**}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor, so I need to make sure I structure the problem correctly according to the given format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then, the problem statement itself should be clearly stated.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question titled \"A closed subspace of a reflexive Banach space is reflexive\", the user is trying to prove that a closed subspace Y of a reflexive Banach space X is also reflexive. They've outlined their approach using the inclusion map J from Y to its bidual Y'' and using the Hahn-Banach theorem to show that the element x obtained from X's reflexivity must lie in Y, leading to the conclusion that J is onto.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states that X is a reflexive Banach space, Y is a closed subspace of X. The goal is to show Y is reflexive. The assumptions here are:\n\n1. X is a reflexive Banach space.\n2. Y is a closed subspace of X.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to X and Y respectively. There's no mention of other properties, so these are the main assumptions.\n\nNext, the problem statement itself is to prove that Y is reflexive. The user's attempt uses the canonical inclusion map into the bidual and leverages the reflexivity of X and the closedness of Y via Hahn-Banach. But according to the format, the problem should be stated concisely without the solution attempt.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem should list the assumptions first, each on a separate line, and then state the problem. The example given had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but here the assumptions are about X and Y. Therefore, the assumptions are X being reflexive Banach and Y being a closed subspace. The problem is to prove Y is reflexive.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). In the current problem, the original problem doesn't have additional constraints beyond X being reflexive and Y closed. So the assumptions should be just those two. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: Let X be a reflexive Banach Space. Let Y be a closed subspace of it. I need to show that Y is reflexive as well.\n\nSo yes, two assumptions: X is reflexive Banach, Y is closed subspace of X. Problem: show Y is reflexive.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$X$ is a reflexive Banach space,\n$Y$ is a closed subspace of $X$.\nProblem:\nProve that $Y$ is reflexive.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption listed two conditions on the same object (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the two conditions are on different objects (X and Y). But according to the instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"X is a reflexive Banach space\" is one assumption about X. \"Y is a closed subspace of X\" is another assumption about Y. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer should list those two assumptions and then the problem statement.",
