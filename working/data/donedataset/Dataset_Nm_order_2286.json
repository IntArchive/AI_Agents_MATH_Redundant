    "Content": "The theorem to prove is: $X$ is a positive continuous random variable with the memoryless property, then $X \\sim Expo(\\lambda)$ for some $\\lambda$ . The proof is explained in this video , but I will type it out here as well. I would like to get some clarification on certain parts of this proof. Proof Let $F$ be the CDF of $X$ , and let $G(x)=P(X>x)=1-F(x)$ . The memoryless property says $G(s+t)=G(s)G(t)$ , we want to show that only the exponential will satisfy this. Try $s=t$ , this gives us $G(2t)=G(t)^2,G(3t)=G(t)^3,...,G(kt)=G(t)^k$ . Similarly, from the above we see that $G(\\frac{t}{2})=G(t)^\\frac{t}{2},...,G(\\frac{t}{k})=G(t)^{\\frac{1}{k}}$ . Combining the two, we get $G(\\frac{m}{n}t)=G(t)^\\frac{m}{n}$ where $\\frac{m}{n}$ is a rational number. Now, if we take the limit of rational numbers, we get real numbers. Thus, $G(xt)=G(t)^x$ for all real $x>0$ . If we let $t=1$ , we see that $G(x)=G(1)^x$ and this looks like the exponential. Thus, $G(1)^x=e^{xlnG(1)}$ , and since $0 <G(1) \\leq  1$ , we can let $lnG(1)=-\\lambda$ . Therefore $e^{xlnG(1)}=e^{-\\lambda x}$ and only exponential can be memoryless. So there are several parts that I am confused about: Why do we use $G(x)=1-F(x)$ instead of just $F(x)$ ? What does the professor mean when he says that you can get real numbers by taking the limit of rational numbers. That is, how did he get from the rational numbers $\\frac{m}{n}$ to the real numbers $x$ ? In the video, he just says that $G(x)=G(1)^x$ looks like an exponential and thus, $G(x)=G(1)^x=e^{xlnG(1)}$ . How did he know that this is an exponential?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Why do we use $G(x)=1−F(x)$ instead of just $F(x)$ ? Because the memoryless property is that: $\\mathsf P(X>t+s\\mid X>s)=\\mathsf P(X>t)$ So we can use this to state: $$\\begin{align}\\mathsf P(X>s+t) =&~\\mathsf P(X>s)\\mathsf P(X>s+t\\mid X>s)\\\\=&~\\mathsf P(X>s)\\mathsf P(X>t)\\\\[2ex] 1-F_X(s+t)=&~ (1-F_X(s))(1-F_X(t))\\\\[1ex] F_X(s+t)=&~ F_X(s)+F_X(t)-F_X(s)F_X(t)\\\\[3ex] G_X(s+t) =&~ G_X(s)G_X(t) & G_X(z):=1-F_X(z)\\end{align}$$ Using $G$ gives a more useful result. What does the professor mean when he says that you can get real numbers by taking the limit of rational numbers. Every real number is the limits of some sequence of rational numbers. $$\\forall r\\in\\Bbb R :\\lim_{n\\in\\Bbb N, n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\lfloor{rn}\\rfloor}{n}=r$$ In the video, he just says that $G(x)=G(1)^x$ looks like an exponential and thus, $G(x)=G(1)^x=e^{x\\ln G(1)}$ .   How did he know that this is an exponential? Because it looks like it.   It is an easily recognised pattern. By definition of the $\\ln()$ function, for any $a$ (except zero), $a^x = e^{x\\ln a}$ . Thus $G(1)^x=e^{x\\ln G(1)}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about a proof that a positive continuous random variable with the memoryless property must be exponentially distributed. The original question has several parts where the user is confused. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem from the given content. The theorem to prove is that X is a positive continuous random variable with the memoryless property, hence X follows an exponential distribution. The assumptions would include that X is positive, continuous, and has the memoryless property. The problem is to show that X ~ Expo(λ) for some λ.\n\nWait, the original problem statement mentions that X is a positive continuous random variable with the memoryless property. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a random variable.\n2. X is positive (i.e., takes values in (0, ∞)).\n3. X is continuous.\n4. X has the memoryless property: P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t) for all s, t > 0.\n\nBut in the example provided earlier, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property of one object. So here, each of these four points should be separate. But maybe some can be combined? For instance, \"X is a positive continuous random variable\" can be split into two: positive and continuous. Alternatively, maybe it's three assumptions: positive, continuous, memoryless. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem said \"every integer n\" and \"divisible by 7\". The formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each is a separate condition. So here, similarly:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a positive random variable,\nX is a continuous random variable,\nX has the memoryless property.\n\nProblem: Prove that X follows an exponential distribution, i.e., X ~ Expo(λ) for some λ.\n\nBut the user's question is about the proof steps, but the task is to structure the problem as per the format. The user also mentioned confusion about parts of the proof, but according to the instructions, I should filter out the unrelated information and structure the problem. The actual problem to solve is the theorem statement. The rest are the user's confusions about the proof steps, which are part of the question but not the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo the main problem is: Prove that a positive continuous random variable with the memoryless property is exponentially distributed. So the assumptions are the three properties: positivity, continuity, memoryless. Then the problem is to prove it's exponential.\n\nNow, checking the example again, in the example, the original problem had an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem here, the user is talking about a general positive continuous RV with memoryless property. So I think the assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a positive random variable,\nX is a continuous random variable,\nX has the memoryless property.\n\nProblem: Prove that X follows an exponential distribution, i.e., X ~ Expo(λ) for some λ.\n\nWait, but in the original theorem statement, the user wrote: \"X is a positive continuous random variable with the memoryless property, then X ~ Expo(λ)...\". So the problem is to prove that under these conditions, X is exponential. Therefore, the assumptions are exactly those three. The user's question is about the steps in the proof, but the task is to structure the problem, not answer the question. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nX is a positive random variable,\nX is a continuous random variable,\nX has the memoryless property.\nProblem: Prove that X follows an exponential distribution, i.e., X ~ Expo(λ) for some λ.\n\nThe rest of the user's question (the parts they are confused about) are their specific questions about the proof steps, which don't need to be included in the formatted problem. The task is to extract the problem and assumptions from the original question, filtering out the unrelated parts. So the user's specific points about G(x) vs F(x), rational to real numbers, and the exponential form are their confusions but not part of the problem statement. The formatted problem is just the theorem to prove given the assumptions.",
