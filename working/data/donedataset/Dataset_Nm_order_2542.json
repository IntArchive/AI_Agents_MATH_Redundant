    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following solution deliberately avoids finding the prime factorization of $2013$, thanks to the rather generous exponents occuring in the given expression. Let's introduce the $p$-adic valuation: If $p\\in\\mathbb P$ is a prime and $n\\in\\mathbb Z\\setminus\\{0\\}$ let $v_p(n)$ denote the exponent of $p$ in $n$, that is $v_p(n)=\\max\\{r\\in\\mathbb Z: p^r|n\\}$. For convenience, $v_p(0)=+\\infty$. Then $$\\tag1v_p(ab)=v_p(a)+v_p(b)$$ and $$\\tag2v_p(a\\pm b)\\ge\\min\\{v_p(a),v_p(b)\\}$$ and more specifically\n$$\\tag3v_p(a\\pm b)=\\min\\{v_p(a),v_p(b)\\}\\quad \\text{if }v_p(a)\\ne v_p(b).$$\nRight from $2013<2^{11}$ we get the (awfully crude) estimate\n$$\\tag4 v_p(2013)<11\\quad\\text{for all }p\\in\\mathbb P.$$\nLet \n$$S=\\{p\\in\\mathbb P\\mid\\exists m\\colon m^{2013}-m^{20}+m^{13}-2013\\equiv 0\\pmod p\\}$$ be the set of primes occuring as prime divisors of the considered expression.\nFor example, $$\\tag5 p\\in\\mathbb P,\\, p|2013\\implies p\\in S$$ follows from considering $m=0$. Assume that the set $S$ is finite.\nLet $$M=\\prod_{p\\in S}p.$$ If $p$ is a prime $\\notin S$, then $v_p(M^{2013}-M^{20}+M^{13}-2013)=0$ by definition of $S$ and also $v_p(2013)=0$ because of $(5)$. And for $p\\in S$, we have $v_p(M^{2013}-M^{20}+M^{13})\\ge 13v_p(M)\\ge 13>v_p(2013)$ from $(1)$, $(2)$, and $(4)$; hence $v_p(M^{2013}-M^{20}+M^{13}-2013)=v_p(2013)$ by $(3)$. Thus $v_p(M^{2013}-M^{20}+M^{13}-2013)=v_p(2013)$ for all primes $p$. This implies $$M^{2013}-M^{20}+M^{13}-2013=\\pm2013.$$\nBut from $(5)$ we have $S\\ne\\emptyset$, i.e. $M\\ge 2$ and hence $$\\begin{align}M^{2013}-M^{20}+M^{13}-2013&=(M^{1993}-1)M^{20}+M^{13}-2013\\\\&>M^{13}-2013\\ge2^{13}-2013>2013,\\end{align}$$ contradiction!\nWe conclude from this contradiction that the set $S$ is infinite. Given $N$, we can therefore select $N$ distinct primes $p_k\\in S$, $k=1,\\ldots, N$.\nFor each $k$, there exists $m_k\\in\\mathbb Z$ such that $m_k^{2013}-m_k^{20}+m_k^{13}-2013\\equiv 0\\pmod{p_k}$.\nUsing the Chinese remainder theorem, there exists $m\\in\\mathbb N$ such that $m\\equiv m_k\\pmod{p_k}$ for all $k$. Then \n$$  m^{2013}-m^{20}+m^{13}-2013\\equiv m_k^{2013}-m_k^{20}+m_k^{13}-2013\\equiv 0\\pmod{p_k},$$\ni.e. at least the $N$ different primes $p_k$ are divisors of $ m^{2013}-m^{20}+m^{13}-2013$. Remark: The same argument works with any expression of the form $m^rf(m)+c$, where $f$ is a polynomial and $c$ is not divisible by any $r$th prime power and $f(m)\\ge1$ if $m\\ge \\prod_{p|c}p$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should list each condition on one line, applied to one object. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the problem from Math Stack Exchange: The title is \"Prove that $m^{2013}-m^{20}+m^{13}-2013$ has at least $N$ prime divisors\". The question states that for a positive integer $N>1$, there always exists an $m$ such that the expression has at least $N$ prime divisors. The user mentions it's a good problem but they don't know how to solve it.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem says \"for positive integer $N>1$\", so that's one assumption: $N$ is a positive integer greater than 1. Then, there exists an $m$ such that the polynomial has at least $N$ prime divisors. But the problem is to prove that such an $m$ exists for any $N>1$. The original problem doesn't state any specific conditions on $m$, like $m$ being an integer, but since it's talking about prime divisors, I assume $m$ must be a positive integer as well, because otherwise if $m$ could be negative or non-integer, the expression might not be an integer, making prime divisors undefined. So perhaps the assumption includes that $m$ is a positive integer. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote \"for positive integer $N>1$, There always exists $m$ such that...\", so maybe $m$ is also a positive integer? The problem doesn't explicitly state that, but in number theory problems like this, $m$ is usually an integer unless otherwise specified. So maybe that's an assumption.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, the original problem had $n$ as an integer, so they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" as an assumption. Similarly, here, since the problem is about prime divisors of the expression, $m$ must be such that the expression is an integer. So if $m$ is an integer, then the expression is clearly an integer. If $m$ is not an integer, the expression might not be an integer, so prime divisors wouldn't make sense. Therefore, the assumption is that $m$ is a positive integer. But the problem statement says \"for positive integer $N>1$\", but does it say that $m$ is an integer? The original problem as written in the question says \"for positive integer $N>1$, There always exists $m$ such that...\". The way it's phrased, $m$ might be any integer or positive integer. The user needs to clarify, but since it's a math problem, likely $m$ is an integer. But in the problem statement, it's not explicitly stated. However, since the original problem is from a user who might have omitted that, but in the context, we need to assume $m$ is an integer. Wait, but perhaps the problem is stated as \"for any N>1, there exists m such that...\" where m is an integer. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. $N$ is a positive integer greater than 1.\n2. $m$ is an integer.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that there exists such an m for each N. So the problem's assumptions are only on N, and the conclusion is about existence of m. But in the example given, the user included assumptions about both the variable (n is an integer) and a condition (n divisible by 7). So here, maybe the only assumption is that N is a positive integer greater than 1. Because the problem states \"for positive integer N>1, there exists m such that...\", so N is given with certain conditions, and m's conditions are part of the problem's conclusion. Wait, but m must be an integer for the expression to be an integer. So perhaps the problem implicitly assumes m is an integer. Therefore, to make it explicit, the assumption should include that m is an integer. But in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify that. However, to structure the problem correctly, we need to list all assumptions. Let's check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is written as: \"for positive integer $N>1$,There always exists $m$ such that $$m^{2013}-m^{20}+m^{13}-2013$$ has at least $N$ prime divisors\". The original problem does not specify the domain of m. However, since prime divisors are considered, the expression must evaluate to an integer. Therefore, m must be an integer. But if m is a positive integer, then the expression is an integer. If m is a negative integer, then depending on exponents, it might be negative, but the prime divisors would consider the absolute value. Alternatively, maybe m is intended to be a positive integer. However, the problem statement does not specify. But in mathematical contexts, unless stated otherwise, variables in exponents are assumed to be integers, especially when discussing prime factors.\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem correctly, we should list the assumptions as:\n\n- $N$ is a positive integer.\n- $N > 1$.\n- $m$ is an integer.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"for positive integer $N>1$\", so combining those two, we can write \"$N$ is a positive integer greater than 1\". Then, the problem is to show that there exists an integer $m$ such that the expression has at least $N$ prime divisors. So the assumptions are only about N, but the problem involves m. However, in the example provided, the assumption included both the variable (n is an integer) and an additional condition (n divisible by 7). Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. Maybe that's a mistake in the example. Therefore, the user might have intended that the example was wrong, but in reality, the correct way is to list all the given assumptions. So perhaps in their example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem incorrectly added that. Therefore, the user might want me to extract the assumptions correctly, even if the example is flawed.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the user's example was wrong, but I should follow the instructions to list all assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the problem states \"for positive integer N>1\", so that's an assumption. The existence of m is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- $N$ is a positive integer.\n- $N > 1$.\n\nThen the problem is: There always exists an integer $m$ such that $m^{2013} - m^{20} + m^{13} - 2013$ has at least $N$ prime divisors.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify that m is an integer, but given the context, it's implied. However, in the example, they included the variable's condition (n is an integer) even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that, we need to include the domain of m. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions should include that m is an integer. But the problem statement says \"there exists m such that...\", and in mathematics, unless specified, m could be any integer. However, the expression's prime divisors require the result to be a non-zero integer. So if m is such that the expression is zero, then it's undefined (as zero has infinitely many prime factors). But the problem likely assumes m is chosen such that the expression is non-zero. However, since the problem is to find at least N prime divisors, which requires the expression to be non-zero. So m must be an integer such that the expression is non-zero. But the problem doesn't state that, so perhaps it's an implicit assumption. However, in structuring the problem, should we list that? Probably not, since the problem statement is as given. So perhaps the only explicit assumptions are about N.\n\nBut in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the formatted problem, they list all the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, in this case, the original problem states \"for positive integer N>1\", so the assumptions are:\n\n- $N$ is a positive integer.\n- $N > 1$.\n\nThen the problem is \"There always exists $m$ such that $m^{2013} - m^{20} + m^{13} - 2013$ has at least $N$ prime divisors.\"\n\nBut since the problem is to prove that for each such N, such an m exists, and m's domain is not specified, but in the context of number theory problems like this, m is usually an integer. However, if m is allowed to be any real number, then the problem would be trivial because you could choose m to be a prime number such that the expression becomes a product of N primes. But that doesn't make much sense. Therefore, m is probably intended to be an integer. Therefore, the assumption should include that m is an integer, but the original problem didn't state that. However, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. Here, since the problem is \"there exists m\", but doesn't specify m's domain, perhaps the correct assumptions are only about N. But this is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes m is a positive integer. But in the problem statement, it's not specified. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that the only assumptions are about N. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$N$ is a positive integer,\n$N > 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists $m$ such that $$m^{2013} - m^{20} + m^{13} - 2013$$ has at least $N$ prime divisors.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for positive integer N>1, There always exists m such that...\". So the problem is: For every N>1 (positive integer), there exists an m (integer, presumably) such that the expression has at least N prime divisors. So the assumptions are on N, and the problem is to show existence of m (with m's conditions implicit). But in the example, they included n's condition as an assumption. Therefore, perhaps here, even though the problem doesn't specify m's domain, we should assume m is an integer and list that as an assumption. However, the original problem didn't state it. This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, since the problem is stated as in the context of number theory, m is an integer, so it's an implicit assumption.\n\nBut to follow the example, where the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", which was included as an assumption, here since the problem says \"there exists m\", but doesn't specify m's type, perhaps we should infer that m is an integer. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $N$ is a positive integer.\n- $N > 1$.\n- $m$ is an integer.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state that m is an integer. So this is adding an assumption not present in the original. That's a problem. Alternatively, the problem might have m as an integer, but since it's not specified, maybe we should not include it. However, in mathematical problems, especially involving primes, the variables are typically integers unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not restrict m to integers, but then the concept of prime divisors is more complex. For example, if m is a rational number, the expression could be a fraction, but prime divisors would refer to the prime factors of the numerator and denominator. But the problem likely assumes the expression is an integer. Therefore, m must be chosen such that the expression is an integer, which happens when m is an integer. Hence, m is assumed to be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- $N$ is a positive integer greater than 1.\n- $m$ is an integer.\n\nBut the original problem states \"for positive integer N>1\", which covers the first part. The second part is inferred. However, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original (n divisible by 7). Wait, that seems incorrect. The original example's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, and we should not follow that. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, we should only list the assumptions explicitly given in the problem statement, which is that N is a positive integer greater than 1. The m is part of the problem's conclusion (existence), so its conditions are not assumptions but part of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$N$ is a positive integer,\n$N > 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an integer $m$ such that $$m^{2013} - m^{20} + m^{13} - 2013$$ has at least $N$ prime divisors.\n\nBut since the problem statement says \"There always exists m\", the problem is to prove that for each such N, there's an m (integer) making the expression have at least N prime divisors. Therefore, the assumptions are on N, and m is part of the problem's conclusion. Hence, the formatted problem would have the two assumptions about N, and the problem is as stated.\n\nBut in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption not in the original (n divisible by 7). That was a mistake, perhaps. Therefore, in the current problem, we should not add assumptions not present in the original. The original problem states \"for positive integer N>1\", which are the assumptions. The existence of m is part of what needs to be proven. Therefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n$N$ is a positive integer,\n$N > 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an integer $m$ such that $$m^{2013} - m^{20} + m^{13} - 2013$$ has at least $N$ prime divisors.\n\nHowever, the original problem didn't specify that m is an integer. So if we strictly follow the original problem statement, the assumptions are only about N. But in the problem statement, the user wrote \"There always exists m such that...\", and in mathematics, unless specified, m could be any real number. But prime divisors of a non-integer don't make sense. Therefore, the problem must assume that m is an integer. Therefore, we need to include that m is an integer as an assumption. But in the problem statement, it's part of the conclusion (\"there exists m\"), not an assumption. Hmm. Wait, no. The problem is saying that for each N>1, there exists an m (which must be an integer, otherwise the expression's prime factors are undefined) such that the expression has at least N prime divisors. Therefore, the fact that m is an integer is a condition on m's existence, not an assumption. Therefore, it's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are only about N. Hence, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$N$ is a positive integer,\n$N > 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an integer $m$ such that $$m^{2013} - m^{20} + m^{13} - 2013$$ has at least $N$ prime divisors.\n\nBut the original problem didn't specify \"integer m\", which is a problem. But since prime divisors are only defined for integers, it's implied that m must be an integer. Therefore, the problem as stated in the original implicitly requires m to be an integer. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the problem statement should include that m is an integer. So the problem is to prove that there exists an integer m such that... Therefore, the assumptions are on N, and the problem includes the existence of an integer m. Therefore, the correct formatted problem is as above.",
