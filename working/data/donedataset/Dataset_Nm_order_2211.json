    "Content": "I was reading Herrlich & Strecker's Category Theory , and there is a theorem called The Canonical construction of Pullbacks which states that if a category has products and equalizers, then it has pullbacks. So I started to ask myself for some kind of converse. For instance, it is false that pullbacks and equalizers imply products, since the category of fields has pullbacks and equalizers but not products. Then I asked if products and pullbacks imply equalizers. I haven't been able to come up with a counterexample, so I guess it must be true. Is there a proof of this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, products and pullbacks imply equalizers. The equalizer of $f,g: A \\to B$ is the pullback of $(1,f)$ and $(1,g): A \\to A\\times B$. A cone $C$ over the pullback diagram of $(1,f)$ and $(1,g)$ has maps $\\pi_1,\\pi_2: C \\to A$ and by commutativity of the diagram we know $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2$ and $f \\circ \\pi_1 = g \\circ \\pi_2$. This is clearly equivalent to a cone over the equalizer diagram of $f,g: A \\to B$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, filter the Math Stack Exchange question, and structure it into the specified format. The example they provided shows how assumptions are listed and the problem is stated concisely. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question from the user. The question is about whether having products and pullbacks in a category implies the existence of equalizers. The user mentions that they couldn't find a counterexample and think it might be true, asking for a proof.\n\nNow, applying the format: The \"Assumption\" section should list each condition applied to one object. The problem is to determine if products and pullbacks imply equalizers. \n\nLooking at the example, assumptions are specific. Here, the category has products and pullbacks. Each of these is a separate property. So, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The category has products.\n2. The category has pullbacks.\n\nThe problem is to prove whether these imply the existence of equalizers.\n\nWait, but the original problem also mentions that the converse (products and equalizers implying pullbacks) is a known theorem. The user is asking about the converse: do products and pullbacks imply equalizers? So the structured problem should reflect that.\n\nI need to make sure the assumptions are correctly separated. Each assumption is a single property of the category. So \"has products\" and \"has pullbacks\" are two separate assumptions. The problem is whether these two imply that the category has equalizers.\n\nSo the formatted version would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe category has products,\nThe category has pullbacks.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the category has equalizers.\n\nYes, that seems right. The original question's core is whether products + pullbacks lead to equalizers. The user's confusion was about the converse of the theorem they cited, which is products and equalizers give pullbacks. Their question is the reverse. So the assumptions are the presence of products and pullbacks, and the problem is to prove equalizers exist.",
