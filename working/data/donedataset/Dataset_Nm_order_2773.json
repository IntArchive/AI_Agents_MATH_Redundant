    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided helps clarify the expectations. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title mentions a conjecture involving a sum that equals 2C/π, where C is Catalan's constant. The actual question in the body presents a similar sum but with a denominator of 2^{4n+1} and the result is C/π. There's a discrepancy here between the title and the question body. The user might have made a typo or miscalculation in either the title or the question. \n\nLooking at the example given, the key is to extract assumptions. In the example, the original problem had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the problem statement didn't explicitly state that. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That contradicts the original problem. Hmm, maybe the example had a typo or error. Wait, perhaps the user intended to show that even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem incorrectly added an assumption. That's confusing. Maybe the example was a bad one, but I need to follow the user's instructions regardless.\n\nBut putting that aside, focusing on the current problem. The task is to list the assumptions of the problem line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem.\n\nThe original problem is about proving a specific sum involving central binomial coefficients squared, a fraction with n(6n-1) over (2n-1)^2(2n+1), multiplied by 2^{-4n}, and summed from n=0 to infinity equals 2C/pi or C/pi depending on the part. The user in the question body wrote equation (1) as summing from n=0 to infinity of {2n choose n}^2 / 2^{4n+1} * [n(6n-1)/( (2n-1)^2(2n+1) )] equals C/pi. The title says the sum equals 2C/pi. So there's inconsistency here. \n\nBut the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So assumptions would be the conditions given. The problem as stated in the body is to prove the sum equals C/pi. The title says 2C/pi. Which one is correct? The user might have made a mistake. The question body's equation (1) is the one the user is asking about. The title might be incorrect. So the problem should be as per the question body: sum equals C/pi. However, perhaps there's a missing factor. The user in the question wrote 2^{4n+1} in the denominator. Let's check: {2n choose n}^2 / 2^{4n+1} times the fraction. If the title is 2^{4n}, then perhaps the user messed up. But in any case, the problem as presented in the question body is the one to consider. \n\nBut the user says to filter unrelated information. The title might be extraneous. The problem is in the question body: sum_{n=0}^\\infty {2n choose n}^2 / 2^{4n+1} * [n(6n-1)/((2n-1)^2(2n+1))] = C/pi. So the assumptions would be... Well, in the example, assumptions were about the variables involved, like n being an integer. Here, the sum is from n=0 to infinity, so each term is defined for n >=0 integers. But perhaps there are convergence conditions? For example, the series converges, so that the sum exists. But maybe that's part of the problem. The problem is to prove the equality, so perhaps the assumptions are that n is a non-negative integer, and the series converges. However, in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem then listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but still, the task is to structure the problem as per the user's instructions, which in the example included adding an assumption not present in the original problem. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe the user intended that the assumptions are all the conditions needed for the problem to hold, even if not explicitly stated? For example, in the original problem, maybe n needs to be divisible by 7 for A(n) to be divisible by 91? But 91 is 7*13, so perhaps for all integers n, A(n) is divisible by 91, which would require divisibility by both 7 and 13. But if the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7, that would make the problem incorrect. So maybe the example is wrong. \n\nBut regardless, the current problem is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question. The user's question is to prove the sum equals C/pi. So the assumptions would include that n is a non-negative integer (since the sum starts at n=0), and that the series converges (though convergence might be part of what needs to be proven). But in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer, even though the original problem already stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, the assumption is that n is an integer, and n >=0. However, in the sum, n ranges over non-negative integers, so that's part of the problem's structure. \n\nBut the user's format requires listing assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So, first, n is a non-negative integer. Second, the series converges (if that's an assumption). However, convergence might be part of the problem. If the problem is to prove the sum equals C/pi, then the convergence is part of the result. So perhaps the only assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. But in the sum, n is the index variable, so it's already quantified over n starting from 0 to infinity. So maybe there are no assumptions needed beyond the problem statement. But in the example, they added an assumption even when the original problem didn't state it. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the actual task is to list any implicit assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no specific assumptions beyond what's given, so the assumptions section could be empty. But the example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem statement. For instance, in the example, the problem was for every integer n, so the assumption is n is an integer, but then an extra assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Which seems contradictory. So maybe the example is flawed, but I have to follow the user's instruction. \n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the only assumption I can think of is that n is a non-negative integer, which is inherent in the summation from n=0 to infinity. However, since the sum is over n, which are integers starting at 0, that's part of the problem's structure. But in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Therefore, following the example's approach, even if redundant, we list n being an integer. \n\nBut in the current problem, the sum is over n starting at 0, so n is a non-negative integer. Hence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't have other conditions. However, the term in the sum has denominators (2n-1)^2 and (2n+1). For n=0, the denominator (2n-1)^2 becomes (-1)^2 = 1, and 2n+1 =1, so no division by zero. For n>=0, all terms are defined. So perhaps no other assumptions needed. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: n is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{{2n \\choose n}^2}{2^{4n+1}} \\frac{n(6n-1)}{(2n-1)^2(2n+1)}=\\frac{C}{\\pi}$$\nwhere C is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut the title of the question says the sum equals 2C/pi. Let me check the original problem again. The title is:\n\n\"Conjecture $\\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty}{2n \\choose n}^22^{-4n} \\frac{n(6n-1)}{(2n-1)^2(2n+1)}=\\frac{2C}{\\pi} $\"\n\nBut the question body has:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{{2n \\choose n}^2}{2^{4n+1}} \\frac{n(6n-1)}{(2n-1)^2(2n+1)}=\\frac{C}{\\pi} \\tag1$$\n\nSo there's a discrepancy. In the title, the denominator is 2^{4n}, and the result is 2C/pi. In the question body, the denominator is 2^{4n+1}, leading to C/pi. So the user might have a mistake in either the title or the question. Since the problem is presented in the question body as equation (1), I should take that as the correct version. Therefore, the problem is to prove the sum equals C/pi. The title's version might be a typo.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would list the assumption that n is a non-negative integer (since the sum is from n=0 to infinity), and the problem is to prove the equality with C/pi.\n\nAlternatively, since n is the summation index, it's implicitly an integer >=0, so maybe no assumption is needed. But following the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed. Therefore, here, since the sum is over n=0,1,2,..., the assumption is n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems to add an extra condition not in the original problem. That might be an error in the example. However, given that, I need to follow the user's instruction. \n\nIn the current problem, there's no explicit condition on n beyond being in the sum. Therefore, the only assumption is that each term in the sum is defined, which they are for n >=0. So perhaps no assumptions beyond n being a non-negative integer. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: n is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{{2n \\choose n}^2}{2^{4n+1}} \\cdot \\frac{n(6n-1)}{(2n-1)^2(2n+1)} = \\frac{C}{\\pi},$$\nwhere C is Catalan's constant.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The key is to list the assumption about n, which is part of the summation index, hence non-negative integers. The problem is to prove the equality.",
