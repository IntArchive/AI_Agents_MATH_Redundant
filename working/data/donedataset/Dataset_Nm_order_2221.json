    "Content": "I have this question that seems to be an application of the Pigeonhole Principle, but I can't see how. Let $n\\geq3$.\nConsider the set $S=\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ and $2n+1$ nonempty random subsets of $S$. Prove that there are at least three of those subsets $B_1,B_2,B_3$ such that $(\\forall i\\neq j)B_i\\not\\subset B_j$. How can I apply the pigeonhole principle for this?Is the straightforward approach any good? I am asking because the way the statement is, a proof by contradiction seems more appropriate... I tried constructing the three sets out of a given random choice of subsets: Say $A_1,A_2,...,A_{2n+1}$ are the 2n+1 subsets. Since the choice is random, we can consider that a subcollection exists, say A,B,...,C such that these sets have at least one element of S not in common. These would be the boxes in the principle...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The strong pigeonhole principle states that if there are $n$ pigeons and $h$ holes, then there is a hole with at least $\\left \\lceil \\dfrac nh \\right \\rceil$ pigeons. Think of a Hasse Diagram: Let the $2n+1$ sets you select be the pigeons, and let your holes be the \"levels\" in this diagram. That is, let the first hole be the set of subsets of $1$ element, the second hole is the set of subsets of $2$ elements, ..., the $n^{th}$ hole is the set of subsets with $n$ elements. Your $2n+1$ pigeons must be stuffed in these $n$ holes, so there must be a hole with at least $\\left \\lceil \\dfrac {2n+1}{n} \\right\\rceil=3$ pigeons. That means that three of your subsets must belong on the same level, so they cannot contain each other.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the key assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe title mentions the pigeonhole principle, so that's a hint about the method. The user is asking how to apply it here. The problem states: Let n be greater than or equal to 3. Consider the set S = {1, 2, ..., n}. We have 2n+1 nonempty random subsets of S. We need to prove that there are at least three subsets B1, B2, B3 such that for any i ≠ j, Bi is not a subset of Bj. The user is confused about applying the pigeonhole principle and mentions a possible contradiction approach.\n\nFirst, list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's parse:\n\n1. n is an integer with n ≥ 3.\n2. S is the set {1, 2, ..., n}.\n3. There are 2n+1 nonempty subsets of S considered.\n4. The subsets are chosen randomly (but nonempty).\n5. The problem requires proving that among these subsets, at least three are such that none is a subset of another.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"nonempty random subsets\" but maybe \"random\" here is just that they are arbitrary, not necessarily probabilistic. The key is that they are nonempty. So maybe \"random\" here is just \"arbitrary\" as in any possible subsets. So perhaps adjust that.\n\nSo assumptions:\n\n- n is an integer where n ≥ 3.\n- S is the set {1, 2, ..., n}.\n- 2n+1 nonempty subsets of S are given.\n- Each subset is nonempty.\n\nThe problem is to prove that among these 2n+1 subsets, there exist three subsets B1, B2, B3 such that for all i ≠ j, Bi is not a subset of Bj.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"such that (∀i≠j) B_i not⊂ B_j\". So each pair among the three is not in a subset relation. So they are mutually incomparable by inclusion.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list each condition. Let me check the example given. The example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So each condition is separate.\n\nSo for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 3.\n- S is the set {1, 2, ..., n}.\n- 2n+1 nonempty subsets of S are considered.\n- Each subset is nonempty.\n\nWait, but \"nonempty random subsets\" – maybe \"random\" is not a condition here. The problem states \"nonempty random subsets\" but perhaps \"random\" is not necessary for the assumptions. Maybe it's just 2n+1 nonempty subsets. The user is saying that the subsets are chosen randomly, but in mathematical terms, the problem is deterministic: given any 2n+1 nonempty subsets, prove that three exist with the given property. So \"random\" here might be misleading. The problem is about any collection of 2n+1 nonempty subsets. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer with n ≥ 3.\n- S = {1, 2, ..., n}.\n- 2n+1 nonempty subsets of S are given.\n\nSo each of these as separate lines.\n\nThe problem is to prove that among these subsets, there are three subsets B1, B2, B3 such that no one is a subset of another.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 3,\nS is the set {1, 2, ..., n},\n2n+1 nonempty subsets of S are considered,\nEach subset is nonempty.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist at least three subsets B₁, B₂, B₃ such that for all i ≠ j, Bᵢ is not a subset of Bⱼ.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement says \"nonempty random subsets of S\" – maybe \"random\" is part of the problem, but in mathematical terms, it's more accurate to say \"arbitrary\" or \"any\" subsets. Since the user wrote \"nonempty random subsets\", but in the problem, it's probably \"any 2n+1 nonempty subsets\". So perhaps \"random\" here is not a necessary condition. The problem is that given any 2n+1 nonempty subsets, there must be three with the inclusion property. Therefore, the fifth assumption is redundant because it's covered by the fourth. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 3,\nS is the set {1, 2, ..., n},\n2n+1 nonempty subsets of S are considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that among the 2n+1 subsets, there exist at least three subsets B₁, B₂, B₃ such that for all i ≠ j, Bᵢ is not a subset of Bⱼ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"each subset is nonempty\" is part of the problem's conditions, but the original question states \"2n+1 nonempty random subsets of S\". So \"nonempty\" is important. Therefore, the fourth assumption is \"2n+1 nonempty subsets of S are considered\".\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 3,\nS is the set {1, 2, ..., n},\n2n+1 nonempty subsets of S are considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are at least three subsets B₁, B₂, B₃ among them such that for all i ≠ j, Bᵢ is not a subset of Bⱼ.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property. The problem is then to prove the existence of three subsets with the mutual non-inclusion.",
