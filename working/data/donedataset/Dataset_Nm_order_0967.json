    "Content": "Is there a simple way to prove this fact : For all holomorphic functions $f : \\mathbb C \\to \\mathbb C$, there is an holomorphic function $\\psi : \\mathbb C \\to \\mathbb C$ such that $$\\psi(z+1) = \\psi(z) + f(z) $$ The solution I know use Galois covering spaces and summand of automorphy. Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As I mentioned in a comment, there are two very simple ways of solving the functional equation $\\psi(z+1)=\\psi(z)+f(z)$, for $\\psi$ in terms of $f$. They are,\n\\begin{align}\n\\psi(z)&=-f(z)-f(z+1)-f(z+2)-f(z+3)-\\cdots,{\\rm\\ and,}\\\\\n\\psi(z)&=f(z-1)+f(z-2)+f(z-3)+\\cdots.\n\\end{align}\nThese solutions will only apply if either of the respective sums converge and, if we want $\\psi$ to be holomorphic, then we require locally uniform convergence. For example, taking $f(z)=e^{az}$ then, for $\\Re(a)\\not=0$, the solutions above give $\\psi(z)=e^{az}/(e^a-1)$ (using the first method for $\\Re(a)<0$ and the second for $\\Re(a)>0$). More generally, we can prove the following, Lemma: Let $f\\colon\\mathbb{C}\\to\\mathbb{C}$ be entire. Then, there exists entire $g,h$ with $f=g+h$ and such that, for each $K>0$, $z^2g(z)$ and $z^2h(-z)$ are uniformly bounded on the horizontal strip $-K\\le\\Im(z)\\le K$ with $\\Re(z)>0$. I'll prove this in a moment. First, however, we can see that it gives an easy solution to the functional equation by applying the first method above to $g$ and the second to $h$,\n\\begin{align}\n\\psi(z)=&-g(z)-g(z+1)-g(z+2)-\\cdots\\\\\n&+h(z-1)+h(z-2)+h(z-3)+\\cdots.\n\\end{align} I'll now prove the lemma stated above, using a result on approximating functions by entire functions due to Arakelian. Let $E$ be the set of $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ such that $2\\lvert\\Im(z)\\rvert+1\\le\\lvert\\Re(z)\\rvert$. This is an unbounded closed subset of $\\mathbb{C}$ and consists of two connected components, one for $\\Re(z)\\le-1$ and one for $\\Re(z)\\ge1$. Furthermore, for each $K>0$, the strip $-K\\le\\Im(z)\\le K$ is contained in the union of $E$ and a bounded set. So, it is enough that the functions $g,h$ constructed in the lemma are such that $z^2g(z)$ and $z^2h(-z)$ are bounded on the component of $E$ with $\\Re(z)\\ge1$. We can define a continuous function $F\\colon E\\to\\mathbb{C}$ by setting $F(z)=e^{z^2}f(z)$ for $\\Re(z)\\le-1$ and $F(z)=0$ otherwise. This is also analytic on the interior of $E$. Now, $E$ is an Arakelian set. That is, it is a closed subset of $\\mathbb{C}$ whose complement does not contain any bounded connected components and such that, for each closed disk $D$, the union of the closed bounded components of $\\mathbb{C}\\setminus(E\\cup D)$ is bounded (actually, it is empty, so trivially bounded). Then, Arakelian's approximation theorem states that, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there is an entire function $G$ with $\\lvert F-G\\rvert\\le\\epsilon$ on $E$. If we set $g(z)=e^{-z^2}G(z)$ and $h(z)=f(z)-g(z)$ then we see that $\\lvert e^{z^2}g(z)\\rvert$ and $\\rvert e^{z^2} h(-z)\\rvert$ are bounded by $\\epsilon$ on the component of $E$ with $\\Re(z)\\ge1$. Finally, on $E$,\n$$\n\\Re(z^2)=\\Re(z)^2-\\Im(z)^2\\ge\\frac35\\left(\\Re(z)^2+\\Im(z)^2\\right)=\\frac35\\lvert z\\rvert^2.\n$$\nSo,\n$$\n\\lvert e^{z^2}\\rvert=\\exp(\\Re(z^2))\\ge\\exp(3\\lvert z\\rvert^2/5)\\ge\\frac35\\lvert z\\rvert^2,\n$$\nand $z^2g(z)$, $z^2h(-z)$ are bounded on the component of $E$ with $\\Re(z)\\ge1$ as required.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, similar to the example provided. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Existence of a holomorphic function,\" and the question asks if there's a simple way to prove that for every holomorphic function f: C → C, there exists a holomorphic function ψ: C → C such that ψ(z+1) = ψ(z) + f(z). The user mentions that the solution they know uses Galois covering spaces and summand of automorphy, but they're looking for a simpler approach.\n\nNow, following the example, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example listed each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem here, the key assumptions are about the functions involved. The original function f is holomorphic from C to C. Then, the problem is to find another holomorphic function ψ with the specified functional equation. \n\nSo the assumptions should list the properties of f and ψ. Let me parse that:\n\n1. f: C → C is holomorphic. \n2. ψ: C → C is holomorphic. \n3. The equation ψ(z+1) = ψ(z) + f(z) must hold for all z in C.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included conditions on n, like being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the functions' holomorphicity and the functional equation. The problem is to prove the existence of such a ψ given any such f.\n\nWait, but in the example, they listed the assumptions as properties of the objects in the problem. So here, the main assumption is that f is holomorphic. The problem is to find a holomorphic ψ satisfying the equation. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a holomorphic function from C to C.\n\nBut the problem is to show there exists a holomorphic ψ such that ψ(z+1) = ψ(z) + f(z). So the problem statement includes the condition on ψ, which is part of what needs to be proven. However, in the example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, the example might have a mistake? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back, the original example was: \n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. That example might be wrong, but perhaps the user intended to filter out conditions. Maybe the user wants the assumptions to list all the given conditions, but sometimes in the problem statement, conditions are stated as \"for all n\", which are not assumptions but universal quantifiers. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the example is wrong. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow that structure regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to structure the problem by extracting the conditions that are given as part of the problem's hypothesis. In the original example, maybe the problem was misformatted, but perhaps the correct approach is to list the conditions that the problem imposes, not the universal quantifiers. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a miscommunication in the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is correct because 91 is 7*13, so if n is divisible by both 7 and 13, then the expression is divisible by 91. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't require n to be divisible by 7 or 13. Therefore, the example might be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to include all the conditions that the problem's conclusion relies on, but that might not be the case.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps I should proceed by following the user's instruction as per the example, even if the example is flawed. So in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to extract hidden assumptions or split the problem into parts. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but regardless, I should follow the structure as per the example. In the current problem, the original problem states that f is a holomorphic function from C to C, and the task is to prove the existence of a holomorphic ψ satisfying the equation. So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is a holomorphic function from C to C.\n2. ψ is a holomorphic function from C to C.\n3. For all z ∈ C, ψ(z+1) = ψ(z) + f(z).\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that such a ψ exists given f. So the only given assumption is that f is holomorphic, and the problem is to show there exists ψ holomorphic satisfying the equation. Therefore, the assumptions should only list the given conditions. In this case, the only assumption is that f is holomorphic. The rest is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: C → C is holomorphic.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a holomorphic function ψ: C → C such that ψ(z+1) = ψ(z) + f(z) for all z ∈ C.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included properties of the object (n being an integer) and an additional condition (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. This is confusing. Perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem in the example had an error, but the user's formatted version added an assumption. Given that, perhaps for the current problem, the correct approach is to list the given assumptions as f being holomorphic, and the problem is to find ψ holomorphic with the functional equation. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a holomorphic function from C to C.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a holomorphic function ψ: C → C such that ψ(z+1) = ψ(z) + f(z) for all z ∈ C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement includes the conditions on ψ, but since ψ is what we're trying to construct, those are part of the problem's conclusion. Therefore, the assumption is only about f. The problem is to construct ψ with the given properties. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption about f and the problem to prove the existence of ψ with those conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: C → C is holomorphic.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a holomorphic function ψ: C → C such that ψ(z+1) = ψ(z) + f(z) for all z ∈ C.\n\nThat seems correct. The example might have included an extra assumption erroneously, but following the user's instruction to filter unrelated information and structure it as per the example, this would be the way to go.",
