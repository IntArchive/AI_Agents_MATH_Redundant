    "Content": "I'm considering the transfer-function $$ t(x) = \\log(1 + \\exp(x)) $$ and find the beginning of the power series (simply using Pari/GP) as $$ t(x) = \\log(2) + 1/2 x + 1/8 x^2 – 1/192 x^4 + 1/2880 x^6 - \\ldots $$ Examining the pattern of the coefficients I find the much likely composition $$ t(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {\\eta(1-k) \\over k! }x^k $$ where $ \\eta() $ is the Dirichlet eta-(or \"alternating zeta\") function. I'm using this definition in further computations and besides the convincing simplicitiness of the pattern the results are always meaningful. However, I've no idea how I could prove this description of the coefficients. Q: Does someone has a source or an idea, how to do such a proof on oneself? update: Moreover, if we take the/a \"complementary\" function $$ u(x)=\\log(-1+\\exp(x)) $$ then we seem to get the similar looking $$ u(x) = \\log(x) - \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty  { \\zeta(1-k) \\over k!}x^k$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is looking at the transfer function t(x) = log(1 + exp(x)) and derived its power series expansion using Pari/GP. They noticed a pattern in the coefficients which they conjecture involves the Dirichlet eta function. Specifically, they propose that the coefficients are given by η(1−k)/k! for each term x^k. They want to prove this and also mention a similar result for u(x) = log(-1 + exp(x)) involving the zeta function.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about proving the coefficients in the power series of t(x) = log(1 + exp(x)) are given by the Dirichlet eta function. The user lists the power series coefficients they found and their conjecture. The assumptions here would be the definitions of t(x) and u(x), the form of the coefficients involving η and ζ functions, and the series expansions provided.\n\nBut according to the example given, assumptions should list conditions or properties applied to one object each. So for the main problem, the assumptions would include that t(x) is defined as log(1 + exp(x)), the power series expansion given (the coefficients up to x^6), the conjecture that the general coefficient is η(1−k)/k!, and the same for u(x) if needed. However, the problem specifically asks about proving the conjecture for t(x), with u(x) as an additional note. \n\nWait, the user's main problem is about proving the coefficients in t(x) follow the Dirichlet eta function. The update mentions u(x) as a complementary function, but the primary question is about t(x). So the assumptions should include the definition of t(x), the power series coefficients observed, and the conjectured formula involving η. The u(x) part might be considered a separate problem, but since the user included it, perhaps it's part of the problem statement. However, the original question's title and focus are on t(x). \n\nI need to list each assumption as a single line, each applying to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nt(x) = log(1 + exp(x)),\nThe power series expansion of t(x) around x=0 is t(x) = log(2) + (1/2)x + (1/8)x² – (1/192)x⁴ + (1/2880)x⁶ - …,\nThe coefficients of the power series of t(x) are conjectured to be η(1−k)/k! for each term x^k,\nη is the Dirichlet eta function (alternating zeta function),\nu(x) = log(-1 + exp(x)),\nThe power series expansion of u(x) is conjectured to involve ζ(1−k)/k! with a logarithmic term.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove the conjecture for t(x). The u(x) part is additional, so maybe the problem statement includes both, but the main problem is t(x). The user's question is about proving the coefficients for t(x), and mentions u(x) as an update. So perhaps the problem part should include both conjectures, but the assumptions would list both functions and their conjectured series.\n\nBut the example given in the instruction has the problem focused on one main equation. However, the user here has two parts: t(x) and u(x). The user is asking for a proof of the conjecture for t(x), and mentions u(x) as a related complementary function. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement should include both, but the primary focus is t(x). The assistant needs to structure the problem as per the user's question.\n\nSo, to format:\n\nAssumption: Each line is a single condition applied to one object. So:\n\n- t(x) = log(1 + exp(x))\n- The power series expansion of t(x) around x=0 is t(x) = log(2) + 1/2 x + 1/8 x² – 1/192 x⁴ + 1/2880 x⁶ - …\n- The coefficients of the power series of t(x) are given by η(1−k)/k! for k ≥ 0, where η is the Dirichlet eta function\n- u(x) = log(-1 + exp(x))\n- The power series expansion of u(x) is conjectured to be u(x) = log(x) - ∑_{k=1}^∞ (ζ(1−k)/k!) x^k, where ζ is the Riemann zeta function\n\nProblem: Prove that the coefficients in the power series of t(x) = log(1 + exp(x)) are given by η(1−k)/k! and that the coefficients for u(x) = log(-1 + exp(x)) are given by ζ(1−k)/k! (adjusting for the log(x) term).\n\nBut the user's exact problem is to prove the conjecture for t(x), and mentions u(x) as an additional part. The original question's title is about t(x), and the update adds u(x). So perhaps the problem statement includes both, but the main focus is t(x). So structuring:\n\nProblem: Prove that the coefficients in the power series expansion of t(x) = log(1 + exp(x)) are given by ∑_{k=0}^∞ (η(1−k)/k!) x^k, where η is the Dirichlet eta function, and that the coefficients for u(x) = log(-1 + exp(x)) are given by log(x) - ∑_{k=1}^∞ (ζ(1−k)/k!) x^k, where ζ is the Riemann zeta function.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be split into two parts, but according to the example, the problem is a single statement. Therefore, the assumptions should list each condition, and the problem is to prove both conjectures. However, the user's main question is about t(x); the u(x) part is additional. But the user does ask if someone has an idea for such a proof, so perhaps the problem includes both.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have the assumptions listed as individual points and the problem statement encompassing both conjectures.",
