    "Content": "Let $M$ be a (real) $n \\times n$ matrix. For $1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ we denote by $M_{ij}$ the $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ matrix that we get when the $i$th row and $j$th column of $M$ are removed. Now, consider fixed $i$ and $j$ with $i\\neq j$. Let $N$ be the $(n-2) \\times (n-2)$ matrix that we get when removing both the $i$th and $j$th row and the $i$th and $j$th column from $M$. Then the following identity holds:\n$$\n\\det M \\det N = \\det M_{ii}\\det M_{jj} - \\det M_{ij} \\det M_{ji}.\n$$ We were able to prove this looking at all different terms that can occur on both sides when evaluating the determinant as a sum of $n!$ terms (for instance, terms containing $a_{ji}a_{ij}$ are counted both $1$ time in the LHS and $1$ time in the RHS). We are looking for a slick proof that does not involve writing out the determinant. Any suggestions or approaches to this problem are appreciated!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Amazingly, this is exactly Lemma 3 in my paper \"Almost all integer matrices have no integer eigenvalues\" with Erick B. Wong (other than restricting to $i=1,j=2$ which is trivially generalized). There's a short proof there which seems to fit your needs. There's also a reference to a book on curious determinant identities of this sort in the bibliography (which is where we got the proof in the first place).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about a determinant identity involving matrices M, N, and minors M_ij.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that M is a real n×n matrix. Then, for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, M_ij is the (n-1)×(n-1) matrix obtained by removing the i-th row and j-th column. Next, N is defined by removing both i-th and j-th rows and columns, resulting in an (n-2)×(n-2) matrix. The identity given is det M det N = det M_ii det M_jj - det M_ij det M_ji. The conditions include i ≠ j and that i and j are fixed.\n\nSo each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me break it down step by step:\n\n1. M is a real n×n matrix.\n2. For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, M_{ij} is the (n-1)×(n-1) matrix obtained by removing the i-th row and j-th column from M.\n3. N is the (n-2)×(n-2) matrix obtained by removing both the i-th and j-th rows and columns from M.\n4. i and j are fixed indices with i ≠ j.\n\nThese seem to cover all the conditions. The problem is to prove the determinant identity. I need to check if there's any other implicit assumptions. The original proof involved expanding determinants, but the user wants a slick proof without that. However, the assumptions part should only include the given conditions, not the method of proof. So the problem statement is as given in the identity equation.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss anything. The key points are M's size, definition of minors M_ij and N, and i ≠ j. The problem is to prove the identity. The example provided by the user for the previous problem included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the structure of the matrices and the indices. So structuring accordingly.",
