    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that \\( e^x + e^{-x} \\leq 2e^{x^2} \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\). They mentioned trying Taylor series and Lagrange remainders but didn't succeed. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( e^x + e^{-x} \\) is equal to \\( 2\\cosh(x) \\), which is the hyperbolic cosine function. So the inequality simplifies to \\( \\cosh(x) \\leq e^{x^2} \\). That might be a simpler way to look at it.\n\nNow, to prove this inequality for all real \\( x \\), maybe I can consider taking the natural logarithm of both sides. But wait, since both sides are positive (exponentials are always positive), taking the logarithm should preserve the inequality. Let's try that:\n\n\\( \\ln(\\cosh(x)) \\leq x^2 \\).\n\nBut is this true? Let me check for some values. When \\( x = 0 \\), \\( \\cosh(0) = 1 \\), so \\( \\ln(1) = 0 \\leq 0 \\), which holds. For small \\( x \\), maybe using the Taylor series expansion could help. The Taylor series of \\( \\cosh(x) \\) is \\( 1 + \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^4}{24} + \\cdots \\). Taking the natural logarithm of that would give \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^4}{24} + \\cdots) \\). Using the approximation \\( \\ln(1 + y) \\approx y - \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\cdots \\) for small \\( y \\), substituting \\( y = \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^4}{24} \\), we get something like \\( \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^4}{24} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{x^2}{2})^2 + \\cdots = \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^4}{24} - \\frac{x^4}{8} + \\cdots = \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^4}{12} + \\cdots \\). Comparing this to \\( x^2 \\), it's clear that \\( \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^4}{12} \\leq x^2 \\) for small \\( x \\), which holds. But this is just for small \\( x \\); what about larger \\( x \\)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the ratio \\( \\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2e^{x^2}} \\leq 1 \\). Let's define \\( f(x) = \\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2e^{x^2}} \\). If I can show that \\( f(x) \\leq 1 \\) for all real \\( x \\), then the inequality holds. Let's compute \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\( f(x) = \\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2e^{x^2}} = \\frac{\\cosh(x)}{e^{x^2}} \\).\n\nTo show \\( f(x) \\leq 1 \\), maybe take the derivative and find maxima. If the maximum of \\( f(x) \\) is 1, then it's proven. Let's compute \\( f'(x) \\):\n\nFirst, \\( \\cosh(x) = \\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \\), so \\( f(x) = \\cosh(x) e^{-x^2} \\).\n\nThen \\( f'(x) = \\sinh(x) e^{-x^2} + \\cosh(x)(-2x)e^{-x^2} = e^{-x^2} [ \\sinh(x) - 2x \\cosh(x) ] \\).\n\nSet \\( f'(x) = 0 \\), which implies \\( \\sinh(x) - 2x \\cosh(x) = 0 \\).\n\nSo \\( \\sinh(x) = 2x \\cosh(x) \\), which simplifies to \\( \\tanh(x) = 2x \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze \\( \\tanh(x) = 2x \\). The function \\( \\tanh(x) \\) is S-shaped, approaching 1 as \\( x \\to \\infty \\) and -1 as \\( x \\to -\\infty \\). The line \\( 2x \\) is a straight line with slope 2. For positive \\( x \\), when is \\( \\tanh(x) = 2x \\)? At \\( x = 0 \\), both sides are 0. But for \\( x > 0 \\), \\( \\tanh(x) \\) starts at 0 and approaches 1, while \\( 2x \\) increases without bound. So the only solution is \\( x = 0 \\). Similarly, for negative \\( x \\), \\( \\tanh(x) \\) is negative, and \\( 2x \\) is also negative. However, for \\( x < 0 \\), \\( \\tanh(x) \\) approaches -1 as \\( x \\to -\\infty \\), but \\( 2x \\) goes to negative infinity. So again, the only critical point is at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the function \\( f(x) \\) has a critical point at \\( x = 0 \\). Checking the second derivative at 0 might confirm if it's a maximum or minimum. Alternatively, check values around 0. At \\( x = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = \\cosh(0)/e^{0} = 1/1 = 1 \\). For \\( x \\neq 0 \\), let's test \\( x = 1 \\): \\( f(1) = (e + e^{-1})/(2e^{1}) ≈ (2.718 + 0.368)/(2*2.718) ≈ 3.086/5.436 ≈ 0.568 < 1 \\). For \\( x = 0.5 \\): \\( f(0.5) = (e^{0.5} + e^{-0.5})/(2e^{0.25}) ≈ (1.6487 + 0.6065)/2*1.284 ≈ 2.2552/2.568 ≈ 0.878 < 1 \\). For \\( x = -1 \\), same as x=1 due to even function. So it seems that the maximum is indeed at x=0, where f(x)=1, and for other x, it's less than 1. Hence, the inequality holds for all real x.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to square both sides to eliminate the exponentials, but since both sides are positive, squaring should preserve the inequality. Let's see:\n\nOriginal inequality: \\( e^x + e^{-x} \\leq 2e^{x^2} \\).\n\nSquare both sides: \\( (e^x + e^{-x})^2 \\leq 4e^{2x^2} \\).\n\nLeft side: \\( e^{2x} + 2 + e^{-2x} \\).\n\nRight side: \\( 4e^{2x^2} \\).\n\nSo the inequality becomes \\( e^{2x} + 2 + e^{-2x} \\leq 4e^{2x^2} \\).\n\nDivide both sides by 4: \\( \\frac{e^{2x} + 2 + e^{-2x}}{4} \\leq e^{2x^2} \\).\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe use the Taylor series expansion of both sides.\n\nLeft side: \\( e^x + e^{-x} = 2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} \\).\n\nRight side: \\( 2e^{x^2} = 2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{2n}}{n!} \\).\n\nComparing term by term, for each \\( n \\geq 0 \\):\n\nCoefficient of \\( x^{2n} \\) on left: \\( \\frac{2}{(2n)!} \\).\n\nOn right: \\( \\frac{2}{n!} \\).\n\nSince \\( (2n)! \\geq n! \\) for all \\( n \\geq 1 \\), then \\( \\frac{2}{(2n)!} \\leq \\frac{2}{n!} \\). Therefore, each term in the Taylor series of the left side is less than or equal to the corresponding term on the right side. Therefore, the entire series on the left is less than or equal to the right side. Hence, the inequality holds for all real \\( x \\).\n\nThis seems like a valid approach. The key is comparing the coefficients of the Taylor series, which are smaller on the left side for each term beyond the constant term. Since all the coefficients are positive, the inequality holds term by term, and thus the sum of the left side is less than or equal to the sum of the right side.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be proven either by analyzing the function's maximum using calculus or by comparing the Taylor series coefficients. The user was asking for a solution using Taylor polynomials, so focusing on the series comparison might be the way to go.",
