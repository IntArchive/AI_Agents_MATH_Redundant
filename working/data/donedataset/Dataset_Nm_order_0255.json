    "Content": "I'm having some trouble proving that the Gaussian Integer's ring ($\\mathbb{Z}[ i ]$) is an Euclidean domain. Here is what i've got so far. To be a Euclidean domain means that there is a defined application (often called norm) that verifies this two conditions: $\\forall a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i] \\backslash {0} \\hspace{2 mm} a \\mid b \\hspace{2 mm} \\rightarrow N(a) \\leq N (b)$ $\\forall a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i] \\hspace{2 mm} b \\neq 0 \\rightarrow \\exists c,r \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i] \\hspace {2 mm}$ so that $\\hspace{2 mm} a = bc + r \\hspace{2 mm} \\text{and} \\hspace{2 mm} (r = 0 \\hspace{2 mm} \\text{or} \\hspace{2 mm} r \\neq 0 \\hspace{2 mm} N(r) \\lt N (b) )$ I have that the application meant to be the \"norm\" goes: $N(a +b i) = a^2 + b^2$, and I've managed to prove the first condition, given that N is a multiplicative function, but I can not find a way to prove the second condition. I've search for a similar question but I have not found any so far, please redirect me if there's already a question about this and forgive me for my poor use of latex.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable math professor who can parse the Math Stack Exchange question and format it into assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is about proving that the Gaussian Integer ring is a Euclidean domain. The user mentions they have some trouble with the proof, specifically the two conditions required for a Euclidean domain. \n\nThe two conditions are:\n1. For all non-zero a, b in Z[i], if a divides b, then the norm N(a) ≤ N(b).\n2. For all a, b in Z[i] with b ≠ 0, there exist c, r in Z[i] such that a = bc + r with either r = 0 or N(r) < N(b).\n\nThe user states they've already proven the first condition using the norm N(a + bi) = a² + b², which is multiplicative. The problem they're stuck on is proving the second condition (the division algorithm part). \n\nNow, applying the required format. The \"Assumption\" section should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem, the key assumptions here are:\n- The ring in question is the Gaussian integers, Z[i].\n- The norm function is defined as N(a + bi) = a² + b².\n- The first condition (regarding divisibility implying norm inequality) has already been proven.\n- The task is to prove the second condition (existence of quotient and remainder).\n\nWait, but the original problem is to prove that Z[i] is a Euclidean domain, which requires verifying both conditions. However, the user has already handled the first condition and is struggling with the second. So the problem here is specifically about proving the division algorithm part given the norm. \n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included conditions on the variables. Here, the assumptions would be about the ring, the norm function, and what's already been established. \n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n- The ring is the Gaussian integers, denoted as Z[i].\n- The norm function N(a + bi) = a² + b² for any a + bi in Z[i].\n- For all non-zero a, b in Z[i], if a divides b, then N(a) ≤ N(b) (already proven).\n- The problem is to prove the existence of c, r in Z[i] such that a = bc + r with r = 0 or N(r) < N(b) for any a, b in Z[i] with b ≠ 0.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables in the problem (n is an integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about the structure (the ring, the norm) and what's already established. However, the problem statement is to prove that Z[i] is a Euclidean domain, but the user has split it into two parts. Since the user is stuck on the second part, maybe the problem should be focused on that.\n\nBut according to the original question, the problem is to prove that Z[i] is a Euclidean domain. The user has already done the first part and is now asking for help with the second. So perhaps the formatted problem should encapsulate the entire original problem, but the assumptions include the definition of the ring, the norm, and the part already proven. However, the example given in the initial prompt had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions in the problem. So in this case, perhaps the assumptions are the properties of the Gaussian integers and the norm function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. Since the problem is to prove that Z[i] is a Euclidean domain, the assumptions would include the definition of the ring, the definition of the norm, and the fact that the first condition has been proven. But the user is seeking help with the second condition, so maybe the problem is to prove the division algorithm part.\n\nWait, the user's exact question is: \"Prove that the Gaussian Integer's ring is a Euclidean domain.\" They mention they have the two conditions to verify, and they have done the first one but need help with the second. So the formatted problem should probably state the problem as proving that Z[i] is a Euclidean domain, with the assumptions being the definition of the ring, the norm function, and that the first condition is already satisfied. Then the problem is to prove the entire thing, but since the user is stuck on the second part, maybe the problem statement is focused on that.\n\nBut according to the example, the original problem's formatted version included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though in the original problem it was stated as \"for every integer n\". The example included an extra assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, there was an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user provided an example where they added an assumption. Hmm, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants the assistant to follow that structure regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the assistant is supposed to follow the format. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions include \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the user made an error in their example. However, the task is to follow that format. So maybe the user expects that the assumptions list all the conditions given in the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated as separate.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to prove that Z[i] is a Euclidean domain. The problem states the two conditions required. The user has already proven the first condition (divisibility implies norm inequality) and needs to prove the second (division algorithm). Therefore, the assumptions would include the definition of Z[i], the definition of the norm, and the fact that the first condition is already proven. The problem statement would then be to prove the second condition.\n\nBut in the example, the problem statement was the same as the original but with an added assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) divisible by 91. But that changes the problem. So perhaps the example is wrong, but the user wants to structure the problem with assumptions including the conditions, even if they are not in the original problem. That seems odd, but maybe the example was a typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was correct. Wait, 91 is 7*13. If the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But if the formatted problem's assumption is that n is divisible by 7, then the problem becomes proving divisibility by 91 under that assumption. However, the original problem didn't have that restriction. So perhaps the example was incorrectly formatted. But regardless, the user provided that example, so we need to follow the structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to prove Z[i] is a Euclidean domain. The user has managed the first condition and needs the second. So, the assumptions would include:\n\n- The ring is Z[i].\n- The norm N(a + bi) = a² + b².\n- For all non-zero a, b in Z[i], if a divides b, then N(a) ≤ N(b) (already proven).\n\nProblem: Prove that for all a, b in Z[i] with b ≠ 0, there exist c, r in Z[i] such that a = bc + r with r = 0 or N(r) < N(b).\n\nAlternatively, if following the example's structure, which might have included assumptions that were not in the original problem but were perhaps inferred, but I think in the example the user might have made a mistake.\n\nBut since the example added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect, perhaps the user intended that the assumptions are all the given conditions, each on their own line. For the current problem, the original problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- The ring in question is Z[i].\n- The norm is defined as N(a + bi) = a² + b².\n- The first condition (divisibility implies norm) is already proven.\n- The task is to prove the second condition (division algorithm).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7), which were part of the problem's hypotheses. Here, the problem is about the structure of the ring and the norm. \n\nSo perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe ring is $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$,\nThe norm function is $N(a + b i) = a^2 + b^2$,\nFor all non-zero $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$, if $a$ divides $b$, then $N(a) \\leq N(b)$,\n$b \\neq 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for all $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$, there exist $c, r \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that $a = bc + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $N(r) < N(b)$.\n\nBut wait, the \"b ≠ 0\" is part of the problem statement's conditions, so it should be in the problem part. The assumptions are the underlying conditions given. The example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The ring in question is the Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n- The norm is defined as $N(a + b i) = a^2 + b^2$.\n- The first condition (divisibility implies norm inequality) has been proven.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the second condition (division algorithm part).\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem is to prove the entire Euclidean domain, but the user has split it into two parts. However, the user's question is the entire proof, but they are stuck on the second part. So the formatted problem should reflect the entire task but with the first part assumed done.\n\nWait, the example might have had an error, but following the user's example, which included an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps in this case, the assumptions should include the structure of the ring, the norm, and the already proven part. Then the problem is to prove the remaining condition.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is the ring of Gaussian integers,\nThe norm function $N(a + b i) = a^2 + b^2$ is defined for all $a + b i \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$,\nFor all non-zero $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$, if $a$ divides $b$, then $N(a) \\leq N(b)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for every $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with $b \\neq 0$, there exist $c, r \\in \\mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that $a = b c + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $N(r) < N(b)$.\n\nThis seems accurate. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property. The problem is to prove the division algorithm part. The user mentioned they have already proven the first condition, so that's listed as an assumption, and the problem is to prove the second condition.",
