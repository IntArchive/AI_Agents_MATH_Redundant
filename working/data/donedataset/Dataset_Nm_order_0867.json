    "Content": "If $a^3+a^2+a=9b^3+b^2+b$ and $a,b$ are integers then show $a-b$ is a perfect cube. My attempt :I factorized it like below: $(a-b)(a^2+b^2+ab+a+b+1)=8b^3=(2b)^3$ I take $\\gcd(a-b,a^2+b^2+ab+a+b+1)=d$ If $d=1$ then it is clear that $a-b$ is a perfect cube then consider $d>1$ then there is a $p$ that is prime and $p \\mid d$ .We have : $p\\mid a-b \\Rightarrow p \\mid (2b)^3 \\Rightarrow p \\mid 2b \\Rightarrow p\\mid 2$ or $p\\mid b$ If $p\\mid b$ then also $p\\mid a$ (as $p\\mid a-b$ holds). Then we will get to $p \\mid 1$ because: $ p \\mid a^2+b^2+ab+a+b,p \\mid a^2+b^2+ab+a+b+1 \\Rightarrow p \\mid 1$ which is clearly wrong then we have $p\\mid 2$ so $p=2$ means $d=2^k$ where $k$ is a natural number including $0$ .In the case $d=1$ we have the right result. So assemble $k \\ge 1$ .Because $2 \\mid a-b$ we can conclude that $a,b$ have the same parity @Ghartal showed in his answer that if $a,b$ are both even we have a right result but if $a,b$ are both odd we don't. So maybe we have to prove $a,b$ can't be both odd.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It turns out that there are only two rational solutions of\n$a^3+a^2+a = 9b^3+b^2+b$.  One is the obvious integer solution\n$(a,b)=(0,0)$, for which $a-b$ is the cube $0$.\nThe other is $(a,b) = (-7/5, -3/5)$, for which $a-b = -4/5$\nis not a cube but $a,b$ are not integers.  So $a-b$ is indeed\na cube for all the integer solutions, as desired. The proof that there are no other rational solutions is elementary,\nbut requires Fermat's method of descent.  The equation\n$a^3+a^2+a = 9b^3+b^2+b$ defines a smooth cubic curve with\na rational point at $(a,b)=(0,0)$, so it's an elliptic curve\nthat we can bring to standard form $y^2=\\text{cubic}(x)$ by\nprojecting from the origin. Let $(a,b)$ be any rational solution other than $(0,0)$.\nThen $b\\neq 0$ because the nonzero solutions of $a^3+a^2+a$\nare not rational (or even real). Write $a=mb$ and divide by $b$ to get\n$$\n(9-m^3) b^2 + (1-m^2) b + (1-m) = 0.\n$$\nThis equation is quadratic in $b$, so it has rational solutions iff the discriminant is a square.  The discriminant is\n$$\n-3 m^4 + 4 m^3 - 2 m^2 + 36 m - 35 = (1-m)(3m-7)(m^2+2m+5).\n$$\nTaking $m=1$ yields $8b^2 = 0$, so we're back to the $b=0$ solution;\nand $m=7/3$ yields $-4(5b+3)^2/27 = 0$, so $b=-3/5$ and $a=-7/5$.\nWe claim that there are no other solutions. If $m\\neq 1$ we may write $m = 1+(8/x)$ and calculate\n$$\n-3 m^4 + 4 m^3 - 2 m^2 + 36 m - 35 = \\frac{2^8}{x^4} (x^3-2x^2-16x-48),\n$$\nso we seek rational points on the elliptic curve\n$$\ny^2 = x^3-2x^2-16x-48 = (x-6)(x^2+4x+8)\n$$\nother than the \"point at infinity\".\nThe point $(x,y)=(6,0)$ brings us back to $m = 1 + (8/6) = 7/3$,\nand it turns out there are no others.  Since the cubic on the right-hand side \nhas a linear factor, we can try to prove this using Fermat's descent,\nwhich turns out to be enough.  But these days there are other\nresources we can try first: Cremona's mwrank or the LMFDB , and either of these\ntells us that there are no other solutions and that Fermat-style descent\nsuffices to prove it.  In the case of mwrank we'd need a bit of\nadditional computation to exclude other torsion points, so let's go the\ndatabase route: enter the coefficients [0,-2,0,-16,-48] into the\n\"curve, label or isogeny class label\" search window for elliptic curves\nover $\\bf Q$ , and find the entry for this curve of\nconductor 544 (which is small enough that it's also in Cremona's book).\nWe find that the curve has only the known two torsion points\nand rank zero, and moreover that the 2-part of the Tate-Shafarevich group\nis trivial, so a 2-descent suffices to establish rank zero.\nThis completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is: If $a^3 + a^2 + a = 9b^3 + b^2 + b$ and $a, b$ are integers, then show $a - b$ is a perfect cube. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that both a and b are integers. The equation given is a cubic equation relating a and b. The user wants to show that the difference a - b is a perfect cube. \n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single condition on one object. So here, the main assumptions are that a and b are integers and that they satisfy the equation. However, the example included specific conditions like \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't mention it. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems odd. Wait, no, looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13. So maybe the user in the example mistakenly included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but actually, the original problem didn't have that. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is an integer.\n2. b is an integer.\n3. The equation $a^3 + a^2 + a = 9b^3 + b^2 + b$ holds.\n\nThese are three separate assumptions. Each one addresses a single property: a's integrality, b's integrality, and the equation connecting them.\n\nThe problem then is to show that a - b is a perfect cube.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user also mentioned their attempt involving factoring and gcd considerations. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, not to include the attempt. The example didn't include any attempt details, just the problem and assumptions. So the user's attempt in the question should be ignored for the purposes of formatting the problem.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have the assumptions listed as above, and the problem statement as given. Let me check the example again. The original example had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so why is the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\"? That seems like a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in the example. But according to the example given, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem didn't specify that n must be divisible by 7, but the answer might require that. Wait, no. The problem states \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91\". Since 91 is 7*13, perhaps the solution requires showing divisibility by both 7 and 13, but the user in their example mistakenly added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, that seems incorrect. But regardless, the instruction is to follow the example's structure. However, in the current problem, there's no such added assumption. The original problem states that a and b are integers and satisfy the equation. So the assumptions should be exactly those: a and b are integers, and the equation holds. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: a is an integer,\nAssumption: b is an integer,\nAssumption: The equation $a^3 + a^2 + a = 9b^3 + b^2 + b$ holds.\nProblem: Show that $a - b$ is a perfect cube.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem was to show divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user wants me to extract only the given assumptions from the problem statement, not any inferred ones. So in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\". The mention of \"n is divisible by 7\" in the formatted example is wrong. Therefore, maybe there's an error in the example. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they want me to follow it even if it's incorrect. However, in the current problem, the original problem states that a and b are integers and the equation holds. So the assumptions should be those three points. The user's own attempt in the question includes some steps where they factor the equation as (a - b)(a^2 + b^2 + ab + a + b + 1) = (2b)^3, and then consider gcd(a - b, ...). But the problem statement itself doesn't include those steps. The task is to structure the problem, not the solution. Therefore, the assumptions are as above. So the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: $a$ is an integer,\n$b$ is an integer,\n$a^3 + a^2 + a = 9b^3 + b^2 + b$.\nProblem: Show that $a - b$ is a perfect cube.",
