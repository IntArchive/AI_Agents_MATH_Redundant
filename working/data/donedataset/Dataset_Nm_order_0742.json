    "Content": "Let $F$ be a field, $E_1$ and $E_2$ are two distinct extension fields of $F$. Is it the case that we can always somehow find a field $G$ that contains both $E_1$ and $E_2$? In other words, could extensions of fields have different 'direction's such that they are incompatible? Edit: I began to think about this problem while reading a proof. $F$ is a field. $a$ and $b$ are algebraic over $F$. $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are two polynomials in $F[x]$ of minimum degree that respectively make $a$ and $b$ a zero. The proof claims that there is an extension $K$ of $F$ such that all distinct zeros of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ lie in $K$. For a single polynomial, I know this kind of field exists because of the existence of splitting field, why it is true for two polynomials?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider field extensions $E_1/F$ and $E_2/F$. Then the tensor product\n$A=E_1\\otimes_F E_2$ is a commutative ring, not necessarily a field though.\nNon-trivial commutative rings have maximal ideals, by a Zorn's lemma argument.\nLet $I$ be a maximal ideal of $A$. Then $K=A/I$ is a field. The map $x\\mapsto\n\\overline{x\\otimes 1}\\in A/I$ is a ring homomorphism $E_1\\to K$. As $E_1$\nis a field, this is an injective homomorphism, so we can think of $E_1$\nbeing \"contained\" in $K$. Likewise $E_2$ is \"contained\" in $K$. Beware though, the ideal $I$ may not be unique.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The question is about extension fields: Given a field F and two distinct extension fields E1 and E2, can we always find a larger field G that contains both E1 and E2? The user also mentions an edit where they were thinking about this while reading a proof involving algebraic elements a and b over F, with minimal polynomials p(x) and q(x). The proof claims there's an extension K of F containing all distinct zeros of both p and q. The user is confused because they know splitting fields exist for single polynomials, but why for two?\n\nSo the main problem here is whether two extension fields of a base field F can always be embedded into some larger common field. The assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem. Let's break down the original question and the edit to extract assumptions.\n\nOriginal problem assumptions:\n- F is a field.\n- E1 and E2 are two distinct extension fields of F.\n- The question is whether there exists a field G that contains both E1 and E2 as subfields.\n\nIn the edit, the context is about a and b being algebraic over F, with minimal polynomials p(x) and q(x). The proof uses the existence of an extension K of F that contains all zeros of both p and q. So for this specific case, the assumptions would be:\n- F is a field.\n- a and b are algebraic over F.\n- p(x) is the minimal polynomial of a over F.\n- q(x) is the minimal polynomial of b over F.\n- The problem is to show there exists an extension K of F containing all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x).\n\nBut the original question is more general (about any two extensions), while the edit gives a specific case with two polynomials. The user is asking why it's true for two polynomials, similar to splitting fields for one.\n\nWait, the example given in the original query was about divisibility by 91, where the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem might not have additional assumptions beyond the ones stated. The user's task is to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated info.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, but the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem's assumption was that n is an integer, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem changed it to include n divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem says: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the example is wrong? Because 91 is 13*7, so perhaps the problem requires that n is divisible by both 6 and something else? Wait, maybe the example was a wrong formatting. But perhaps the user made a mistake there, but regardless, I need to follow the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The question is: Do extension fields always belong to a bigger field? So given F, E1, E2 extensions, can we find G containing both. Then the edit adds a specific case with algebraic elements a and b, minimal polynomials p and q, and the existence of K containing all zeros of p and q.\n\nSo the problem to structure is either the general case or the specific case. The user's main question is the general one, but the edit provides context where they encountered the specific case. The problem as stated in the title is the general one, but the edit's specific case is a sub-question.\n\nHowever, the user wants the problem structured as per the example. Let's see the example: the original problem had a general statement but the formatted problem added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original. Wait, no. Wait the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption is n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which restricts the problem. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants us to follow their structure.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user had a mistake. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem as per the format.\n\nSo for the current problem, the user's question on Math SE is: \"Do extension fields always belong to a bigger field?\" with the specifics about E1 and E2 being extensions of F. Then in the edit, they talk about a and b algebraic over F, with minimal polynomials p and q, and the existence of a field K containing all zeros of p and q.\n\nSo which problem are we supposed to structure? The main question is the general one, but the edit gives a specific instance. The user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nLooking at the original post's title and question, the main problem is the general one about extension fields. The edit adds context about the specific case with polynomials. So perhaps the problem to structure is the specific case mentioned in the edit, because the user is asking why for two polynomials, given that splitting fields exist for one. But the title is about the general case. However, the example given by the user in the original query includes an edited problem that adds context. So maybe we need to extract both the general and the specific problem, but according to the format, each problem should have its own assumptions and problem statement.\n\nWait, the example given was the original problem (about A(n) divisible by 91) and the formatted problem lists assumptions and the problem. So in this case, the user's question on Math SE has both the general question and the specific case. The task is to filter unrelated info and structure the problem. The user probably wants the specific case from the edit, since the title is general but the edit adds a specific problem they are struggling with.\n\nSo, focusing on the edit part: the problem is about a and b being algebraic over F, with minimal polynomials p and q. The proof claims there exists an extension K of F containing all distinct zeros of p and q. The user knows splitting fields exist for a single polynomial, but why for two?\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here would be:\n\n- F is a field.\n- a is algebraic over F.\n- b is algebraic over F.\n- p(x) is the minimal polynomial of a over F.\n- q(x) is the minimal polynomial of b over F.\n- The problem is to prove that there exists an extension K of F such that all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x) lie in K.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user is asking why it's true for two polynomials. The existence for one polynomial is handled by the splitting field. For two polynomials, we can take the compositum of their splitting fields. So the problem is to show that given two polynomials over F, there exists an extension K of F that contains all roots of both polynomials.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- F is a field.\n- p(x) is a polynomial in F[x].\n- q(x) is a polynomial in F[x].\n- (Possibly that p and q are monic and irreducible, but the minimal polynomials are already monic and irreducible, but in the problem statement, the user mentions p and q are minimal polynomials, so maybe we need to include that.)\n\nWait, the original edit says: \"p(x) and q(x) are two polynomials in F[x] of minimum degree that respectively make a and b a zero.\" So p is minimal polynomial of a, q minimal of b. So a and b are algebraic over F.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for this specific problem are:\n\n- F is a field.\n- a is algebraic over F.\n- b is algebraic over F.\n- p(x) is the minimal polynomial of a over F.\n- q(x) is the minimal polynomial of b over F.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an extension K of F such that all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x) lie in K.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased more generally as: Given two polynomials p(x) and q(x) in F[x], prove that there exists an extension field K of F that contains all roots of p(x) and q(x). But in the context of the edit, the polynomials are minimal polynomials of algebraic elements.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So we need to list each assumption line by line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\na is algebraic over F,\nb is algebraic over F,\np(x) is the minimal polynomial of a over F,\nq(x) is the minimal polynomial of b over F.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an extension field K of F such that all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x) lie in K.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about the general case of two extension fields, then the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\nE₁ is an extension field of F,\nE₂ is an extension field of F.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a field G such that G contains both E₁ and E₂ as subfields.\n\nBut the user's confusion arises from the specific case with two polynomials, so maybe that's the problem to structure. However, the title is about the general case. The user mentions both scenarios. Since the example provided by the user includes an original problem and the formatted problem, which may have added an assumption not present in the original (the n divisible by 7), but perhaps the user intended to list all necessary assumptions, even if some were implicit.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's main question in the title is general, but the edit gives a specific instance. To follow the example, perhaps we should structure the specific problem mentioned in the edit, as that's where the user's confusion lies.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem from the edit:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\na is algebraic over F,\nb is algebraic over F,\np(x) is the minimal polynomial of a over F,\nq(x) is the minimal polynomial of b over F.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an extension field K of F such that all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x) lie in K.\n\nAlternatively, the general problem from the title would be:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\nE₁ is an extension field of F,\nE₂ is an extension field of F.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a field G such that G contains both E₁ and E₂.\n\nBut the user's example took a general problem (for every integer n) and added an assumption (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that changes the problem. So maybe the user made a mistake there, but regardless, we need to follow their format.\n\nIn the current problem, the edit's specific case has the assumptions listed above. Therefore, I think the correct formatted problem for the specific case the user is struggling with is the one with the minimal polynomials and algebraic elements.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\na is algebraic over F,\nb is algebraic over F,\np(x) is the minimal polynomial of a over F,\nq(x) is the minimal polynomial of b over F.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an extension field K of F such that all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x) lie in K.\n\nBut wait, the problem in the edit says \"the proof claims that there is an extension K of F such that all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x) lie in K\". So the problem is to prove the existence of such K.\n\nYes, that's the problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should list all the assumptions (F is a field, a and b algebraic over F with minimal polynomials p and q), and the problem is to prove the existence of K.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more general: for any two polynomials p and q in F[x], there exists an extension K containing all their roots. But in the context of the edit, p and q are minimal polynomials of algebraic elements. However, the minimal polynomial of an algebraic element is irreducible, but the general case for any two polynomials would still hold.\n\nBut the user's confusion is about why it's true for two polynomials when they know it's true for one (via splitting fields). Therefore, the problem is: given two polynomials over F, prove there exists an extension containing all roots of both. So the assumptions would be F is a field, p(x) and q(x) are polynomials in F[x]. Problem: Prove existence of extension K of F containing all roots of p(x) and q(x).\n\nBut in the edit, it's specifically about minimal polynomials of algebraic elements, but the existence of such a field K would follow from the existence of a field that splits both p and q. Since the minimal polynomial is irreducible, its splitting field exists, and then the compositum of the splitting fields of p and q would be the desired K.\n\nBut the user's question is why this is possible. So to structure this, the problem is about two polynomials (minimal or not) and the existence of a common extension where both split.\n\nGiven the example format, where the original problem was about A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect. However, the user might have intended to extract necessary conditions. Wait, maybe the original example had a typo or mistake, but we need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current case, the problem from the edit is about two polynomials, so the assumptions are F is a field, p(x) and q(x) are polynomials in F[x], and the problem is to prove there exists an extension K of F containing all roots of p and q.\n\nBut the user mentions that a and b are algebraic, so their minimal polynomials are p and q. Therefore, the assumptions should include that p and q are minimal polynomials of algebraic elements. So:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\na is algebraic over F,\nb is algebraic over F,\np(x) is the minimal polynomial of a over F,\nq(x) is the minimal polynomial of b over F.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an extension field K of F such that all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x) lie in K.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider p and q as any polynomials, not necessarily minimal, then the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\np(x) is a polynomial in F[x],\nq(x) is a polynomial in F[x].\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an extension field K of F such that all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x) lie in K.\n\nBut in the context of the edit, the user is referring to minimal polynomials of algebraic elements, so we should include those specific conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem based on the edit's context is:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\na is algebraic over F,\nb is algebraic over F,\np(x) is the minimal polynomial of a over F,\nq(x) is the minimal polynomial of b over F.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an extension field K of F such that all distinct zeros of p(x) and q(x) lie in K.\n\nThis captures the specific scenario the user is struggling with, which is the case where you have two algebraic elements and their minimal polynomials, and you need a common extension where all their roots exist. The answer would involve taking the compositum of the splitting fields of p and q over F.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be as above.",
