    "Content": "Let $f:V \\to V$ be a linear map such that $(f\\circ f)(v) = -v$. Prove that if $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb R$, $V$ is even dimensional. From what I can figure out for myself, if $V$ is finite dimensional, then every basis of $V$ is finite, i.e. a linearly independently subset of $V$ has a finite number of vectors. And I figure that if $V$ is even dimensional, then every basis of $V$ is even, i.e. a linearly independently subset of $V$ has an even number of vectors. But I'm not sure how to connect these two points.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I heard this story from David Lieberman: Once this question was included in the Qual (qualifying exam) for Harvard graduate students.  As it turned out this one question perfectly predicted all students' performance, so the exam's other 17 questions were not necessary!  Indeed: Every student who did not solve this question flunked their Qual. Every student who solved this problem by fiddling with Jordan canonical forms and the like got a \"conditional pass\". Every student who solved this problem using the determinant passed. $(\\det f)^2 = \\det (f \\circ f) = \\det -I = (-1)^n$ where $n = \\dim V$, so $(-1)^n \\geq 0$ and $n$ is even. [ Note : This assumes that the matrix has real coefficients. As noted in the comments, the result would be wrong over the complex numbers (e.g., let $n=1$ and $f=i$) and some other fields.]",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original problem carefully and identify all the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe problem is about proving that if there's a linear map f: V → V such that composing f with itself (f∘f)(v) = -v, then V, being a finite-dimensional real vector space, must have even dimension. \n\nLet me parse the original question:\n\n- The user mentions a linear map f with the property that applying it twice (f∘f) sends any vector v to -v. So, for every v in V, f(f(v)) = -v.\n- The vector space V is over the real numbers, ℝ.\n- V is finite-dimensional.\n- The goal is to prove that the dimension of V is even.\n\nNow, to structure this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to a single object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. f is a linear map from V to V. (Assumption about f being linear and its domain/codomain)\n2. For every vector v in V, applying f twice gives -v. (f∘f acts as multiplication by -1)\n3. V is a finite-dimensional vector space over ℝ. (Finite-dimensional and real)\n4. The problem is to show that under these conditions, V's dimension is even.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Prove that if V is finite dimensional then V is even dimensional\". But the condition here is the existence of such a linear map f. So maybe the user's original problem statement might have a typo or missing condition. Wait, looking back at the title: \"Prove that if V is finite dimensional then V is even dimensional?\" and the question body says: \"Let f:V→V be a linear map such that (f∘f)(v) = -v. Prove that if V is a finite dimensional vector space over ℝ, V is even dimensional.\"\n\nAh, so the actual problem is: Given a linear map f on V with f∘f = -id, and V is finite-dimensional over ℝ, then V must be even-dimensional.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- V is a real vector space (over ℝ).\n- V is finite-dimensional.\n- There exists a linear map f: V → V such that f∘f = -id_V (since (f∘f)(v) = -v for all v ∈ V).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, the dimension of V is even.\n\nTherefore, structuring this into the format:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a finite-dimensional vector space over ℝ,\nThere exists a linear map f: V → V,\nFor all v ∈ V, (f ∘ f)(v) = -v.\n\nProblem:\nProve that V is even-dimensional.\n\nBut according to the example provided, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So:\n\n- V is a finite-dimensional vector space over ℝ.\n- f is a linear map from V to V.\n- For every vector v in V, (f ∘ f)(v) = -v.\n\nProblem: Prove that V is even-dimensional.\n\nYes, that looks right. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object (V's field and dimension, f's linearity and its domain/codomain, and the composition condition on f).\n\nThe user's example had assumptions split into two lines, even though the original problem's assumptions were perhaps combined. So I need to split each distinct condition into separate lines.\n\nIn the original problem, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem's formatted version:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem: Prove that... divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the actual problem given here, the user's example didn't mention the divisibility by 13 (since 91=7*13). Wait, but maybe the original problem had more conditions? The example given by the user seems to have filtered out some conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem states \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. So maybe the example has an error. However, the user is providing that example as how they want the structure to be. So perhaps they intended that sometimes assumptions are split even if the original problem didn't state them? Or perhaps that example was a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow their structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is correct. So structuring as per their example, which splits each assumption into separate lines.\n\nSo the correct structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nV is a finite-dimensional vector space over ℝ,\nf is a linear map from V to V,\nFor every v in V, (f ∘ f)(v) = -v.\nProblem: Prove that V is even-dimensional.\n\nYes, that's accurate. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove the conclusion.",
