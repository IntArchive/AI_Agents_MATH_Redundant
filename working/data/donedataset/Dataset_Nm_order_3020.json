    "Content": "While answering a recent question I came across the following nice-looking identity: $$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\binom{k-1}{n-k-1}+\\binom{k}{n-k-1}}{\\binom nk}=1\n$$ valid for all integer $n\\ge2$ . Is there a simple algebraic proof of this identity?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The idea of this solution is due to the answer of Claude Leibovici. Indeed the most probable reason for such simple and beautiful result is some hidden telescoping. And if one knows what one is looking for, one finds it: $$\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\binom{k-1}{n-k-1}+\\binom{k}{n-k-1}}{\\binom nk}\n&=\\frac{\\frac{(k-1)!}{(n-k-1)!(2k-n)!}+\\frac{k!}{(n-k-1)!(2k-n+1)!}}{\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{k!(k-1)!(n-k)(3k-n+1)}{n!(2k-n+1)!}\\\\\n&=\\frac1{n!}\\left[\\frac{k!(k+1)!}{(2k-n+1)!}-\\frac{(k-1)!k!}{(2k-n-1)!}\\right].\n\\end{align}$$ Thus: $$\nS_{nm}=\\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\\frac{\\binom{k-1}{n-k-1}+\\binom{k}{n-k-1}}{\\binom nk}\n=\\frac1{n!}\\frac{(m-1)!m!}{(2m-n-1)!},\n$$ and, finally $$\nS_{nn}=1,\n$$ as claimed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving a combinatorial identity. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions, but in that example, the assumptions included both the variable being an integer and a specific divisibility condition. However, looking at the current problem, the identity is stated to be valid for all integers n ≥ 2. \n\nSo first, I need to parse the problem. The identity is a sum from k=1 to n-1 of a fraction involving binomial coefficients, divided by another binomial coefficient, and the sum equals 1. The question is asking for a simple algebraic proof.\n\nNow, the task is to list the assumptions. The problem states \"for all integer n ≥ 2\". So the assumptions would be that n is an integer and n is at least 2. Each assumption should be on a separate line, each addressing one property of one object. In the example, they listed n as an integer and n divisible by 7 as two separate assumptions. Here, similarly, n being integer and n ≥ 2 are two separate conditions. \n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem didn't have the \"n divisible by 7\" part; the user's formatted problem added that. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, no, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13, so maybe the user restructured it with the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, but that's perhaps part of solving the problem, but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, in the current problem, the user just needs to list the given assumptions from the problem as presented.\n\nThe problem states \"valid for all integer n ≥ 2\". Therefore, the assumptions are that n is an integer and that n is greater than or equal to 2. Each of these is a separate assumption. There's no mention of any other conditions on k, since k is the summation index from 1 to n-1, which is determined by n. The binomial coefficients might have implicit conditions, but the problem statement itself doesn't add any other constraints beyond n being an integer ≥ 2.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\binom{k-1}{n-k-1}+\\binom{k}{n-k-1}}{\\binom nk}=1.$$\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The binomial coefficients might require that the upper index is non-negative, but since the problem states it's valid for n ≥ 2, those binomial coefficients must be defined under that condition. For example, when k=1, the terms are binom(0, n-2) and binom(1, n-2). For these to be non-zero, n-2 must be ≤ 0 and ≤1, but since n ≥2, n-2 is ≥0. Wait, when n=2, the upper index for binom(k-1, n-k-1) becomes binom(k-1, 1 -k). Wait, when n=2, the upper index in binom(k-1, 2 -k -1) = binom(k-1, 1 -k). But binomial coefficients where the lower index is negative are zero. So maybe the problem implicitly assumes that those binomial coefficients are defined, but since the problem states it's valid for n ≥2, perhaps the user doesn't need to list those as assumptions because they are handled by the summation and the given n. Therefore, the only explicit assumptions from the problem statement are n is integer and n ≥2.",
