    "Content": "This problem comes from Calculus by Spivak, namely in Chapter 14- \"The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\". Suppose that $f$ is a differentiable function with $f(0)=0$ and $0<f'\\le1$. Prove that for all $x\\ge0$ we have $$ \\int_0^x f^3 \\le \\left(\\int_0^x f\\right)^2. $$ Now, I have a (proposed) solution, so my question is whether the following is correct. We know that both the l.h.s. and r.h.s. of the inequality begin at 0, so we can prove the inequality by showing that the same inequality holds for the derivatives of each side. (If both begin at the same value and one increases more quickly or at the same rate than the other, then that one will also take on a value greater than or equal to the other for all $x\\ge0$.) So, we have $$f^3 \\le 2f\\int_0^x f. $$ If $f=0$ the inequality is clearly satisfied, otherwise we have that $$f^2 \\le 2\\int_0^x f. $$ We then apply the same logic as before, showing that this inequality holds after differentiating (since, again, both expressions evaluate to 0 when $x=0$). So, we have that $$2ff' \\le 2f.$$ We have already taken care of the case that $f=0$ (and the inequality holds anyway for $f=0$) so we end up with $$f' \\le 1.$$ This is given, so the first inequality is proven. I sort of feel (for no particular reason) like part of this may be incorrect, which is why I'm asking here. So if any part (or the whole thing) is incorrect, could someone please point to the mistake? If not, great. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Basically, this is fine, but you seem slightly confused about the logical structure of a backward argument and the $f=0$ business. Every time you say \"So, we have that\", you should say \"So, we want\". And going through the proof from bottom to top, you will see that there is no issue at all about potentially multiplying by 0. I might add as a bonus question that at first sight I wondered if there is any relation to the fact that $\\sum_{k=0}^n k^3 = (\\sum_{k=0}^n k)^2$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, extracting assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original problem carefully. The problem is from Spivak's Calculus, Chapter 14, and asks to prove that the integral of f cubed from 0 to x is less than or equal to the square of the integral of f from 0 to x. The user also provided their proposed solution and is asking for verification.\n\nNow, I need to filter out the assumptions. The problem states that f is a differentiable function with f(0)=0 and 0 < f' ≤ 1. These are the key conditions. Each assumption should be listed separately. \n\nThe first assumption is that f is a differentiable function. The second is f(0)=0. Then, the derivative f' is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1. Each of these applies to the function f. \n\nThe problem statement itself is to prove the inequality involving the integrals. I should present that clearly, making sure to use LaTeX formatting as in the example. \n\nI also need to check if the user's proposed solution is part of the problem statement. Since the problem is just to prove the integral inequality, the user's solution attempt is additional context but not part of the problem itself. So the problem remains as proving the inequality given the assumptions on f. \n\nLet me structure it:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a differentiable function,\n- f(0) = 0,\n- 0 < f' ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for all x ≥ 0, ∫₀ˣ f³ ≤ (∫₀ˣ f)².\n\nYes, that captures all the necessary conditions and the problem statement without including the user's solution attempt. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property of the function f. The problem is stated concisely with the integral inequality.",
