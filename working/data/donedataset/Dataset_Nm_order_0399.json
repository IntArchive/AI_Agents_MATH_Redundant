    "AcceptedAnswer": "The best way I see to do the simpler integral (the one without the $x$ in front) is to substitute $u=2 \\sin{(x/2)}$ and expand the resulting integrand in a series.  To wit, upon doing the substitution, we get $$\\int_0^{\\pi/3} dx \\: \\log^2{[2 \\sin{(x/2)}]} = \\int_0^1 du \\frac{\\log^2{u}}{\\sqrt{1-u^2/4}}$$ Note that $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-u^2/4}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{4 k}} \\binom{2 k}{k} u^{2 k}$$ Then the integral becomes $$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{4 k}} \\binom{2 k}{k} \\int_0^1 du\\: u^{2 k} \\log^2{u}$$ The integral on the right may be done through integration by parts; the process is very interesting, but I leave it to the reader to get the nifty result that $$\\int_0^1 du\\: u^{2 k} \\log^2{u}=\\frac{2}{(2 k+1)^3}$$ Therefore the evaluation of the integral becomes an evaluation of the following sum: $$2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{4 k}} \\binom{2 k}{k}\\frac{1}{(2 k+1)^3}$$ To evaluate this sum, define $$f(z) = 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{4 k}} \\binom{2 k}{k}\\frac{z^{2 k+1}}{(2 k+1)^3}$$ The desired integral is $f(1)$.  To derive an equation for $f$, recall the binomial series above: $$\\frac{d}{dz}\\left [z \\frac{d}{dz} \\left [ z \\frac{d}{dz} f(z)\\right ] \\right ] = 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{4 k}} \\binom{2 k}{k} z^{2 k} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1-z^2/4}}$$ The resulting integrations are elementary except for the last one, which results in a nasty generalized hypergeometric function, something like $$2 _4F_3\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$ which in fact does numerically check out.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show two integrals involving the square of the logarithm of (2 sin(x/2)) from 0 to π/3. The first integral is without an x term, and the second one includes an x multiplied by that log squared term. They also mentioned they can handle the integral from 0 to π but are stuck on the π/3 limit and the x term. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. Let me look at the example given. The example had the user list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. But in the original problem here, the user is just presenting the integrals to compute. Are there any hidden assumptions here? The original question doesn't specify any conditions except the limits of integration and the integrand. So maybe the assumptions are implicit here. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but then added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example might have been modified. So perhaps in the given problem here, the assumptions are that the functions involved are integrable over the interval, and that the logarithm is defined there. Since sin(x/2) is positive between 0 and π/3, the argument of the log is positive, so the function is defined. So maybe the assumptions would be about the domain where the integrand is valid. But the problem as stated doesn't mention any parameters; it's just definite integrals. So maybe the assumptions are about the variables involved. Let me structure this.\n\nThe problem is to show that two specific integrals equal the given values. The integrands are log squared terms multiplied by 1 or x. The original problem states the user can do the integral from 0 to π but not 0 to π/3. So maybe the assumptions here would be that the integrals are over the interval [0, π/3], and the functions are as defined. Since there's no parameters, perhaps the assumptions are minimal. Let me check the example again. The example's assumption listed the variable's property (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, maybe the variables are x, which is a real variable between 0 and π/3. But since it's a definite integral, perhaps the assumptions are that x is in that interval, and the integrand is properly defined. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the integral setup. The problem is to compute the integrals, so perhaps the assumptions are that the log function is defined (which it is in (0, π/3] since 2 sin(x/2) is between 0 and 2 sin(π/6) = 1, but wait, at x=0, sin(0) = 0, so log(0) would be problematic. However, the integral is from 0 to π/3, so near x=0, log(2 sin(x/2)) ~ log(x), whose square is integrable because the integral of log(x)^2 near 0 converges. So maybe the integral is convergent, which is an assumption. But the problem doesn't state to prove convergence, just to compute the value. So perhaps the main assumptions are that x is in [0, π/3], and the integrand is as given. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes standard calculus conventions. Since the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement, maybe in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, π/3].\n- The integrand functions are defined as $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ and $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- The variable $x$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi/3$.\n- The function $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ is integrable over $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n- The function $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ is integrable over $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n\nBut maybe the problem is presented without needing to state these assumptions, so perhaps just the problem as given. Wait, the original example had the problem statement mention that n is an integer, but then the assumption added that n is divisible by 7. So in the original problem here, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral setup. Wait, but the user just wants the problem structured with assumptions and problem. Since the problem as given is just to compute the integrals, maybe the assumptions are the definitions of the integrals. However, in the example, the user took the original problem's \"for every integer n\" and added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe in that case, the original problem had a missing condition, and the formatted problem corrected it. But in the current problem, the integrals are specific. Maybe there's no need for assumptions here, but the example shows that even if the original problem states something, we need to list assumptions. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the user wants to extract conditions from the problem and list them as assumptions. However, in the current problem, the problem is to compute two definite integrals. There are no variables or parameters here. The problem is to show that these integrals equal the given values. So perhaps the assumptions are about the existence of the integrals, but since the user is asking to prove the equalities, the main problem is the computation. Therefore, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the integral definitions. But according to the example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So here, the problem is about integrals from 0 to π/3, so the assumptions would include that the integration variable x is over [0, π/3], and the integrand functions are as given. But each assumption should be one line, addressing one property of one object. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integration variable $x$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi/3$.\n- The integrand $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ is considered.\n- The integrand $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ is considered.\n\nBut perhaps that's redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is to compute the integrals, maybe the assumptions are just the interval and the integrand. However, the example included multiple assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. In this case, since there are two separate integrals, maybe each integrand is listed as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem statement is straightforward, and the assumptions are minimal. Let me check the user's instruction again. They want to \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as the following format\". The example filtered the original problem which mentioned \"for every integer n\", but then added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed it to assuming n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that seems contradictory. Because 91 is 7*13. If n is divisible by 7, then 5^n and 6^n would have factors related to 7, but 13 is another prime. Maybe the example is incorrect, or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the current task is to structure the given problem in the same way. \n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to show two integrals equal to specific values. The original question mentions that they can solve the integral from 0 to π but not from 0 to π/3, and they don't know how to handle the x term. The problem as stated is to show the two integrals equal those values. So the assumptions would be related to the integral setup. Let me try to list the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The first integral is over the interval $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n- The integrand of the first integral is $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n- The second integral is over the interval $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n- The integrand of the second integral is $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition of one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The variable $x$ is a real number in the interval $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n- The function $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ is integrable over $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n- The function $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ is integrable over $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n\nBut maybe these are too obvious. Alternatively, the problem could be structured without assumptions if there are none. However, the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to list the components of the problem as assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- Consider the integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx$.\n- Consider the integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/3} x\\log^2 \\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx$.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single condition. Alternatively, since the problem is to evaluate these integrals, maybe the assumptions are just the definitions of the integrals. However, according to the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". So here, the assumptions would be the intervals and the integrands. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx$ is considered.\n- The integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/3} x\\log^2 \\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx$ is considered.\n\nBut each assumption line should address one property. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The first integral is defined over $x$ from $0$ to $\\pi/3$.\n- The integrand of the first integral is $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n- The second integral is defined over $x$ from $0$ to $\\pi/3$.\n- The integrand of the second integral is $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n\nBut maybe this is redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equalities, perhaps the assumptions are about the existence of the integrals. However, since the user is asking to compute them, perhaps the main problem is as stated. I think in this case, since there are no parameters or conditions beyond the integrals themselves, the assumptions would be minimal. The problem is to show the two integrals equal the given values. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integrals are taken over the interval $[0, \\pi/3]$.\nProblem:\nShow that\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{7\\pi^3}{108}, \\\\\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3}x\\log^2 \\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{17\\pi^4}{6480}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a line with one property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- $x$ is a real variable in the interval $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n- The function $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ is squared logarithm.\n- The function $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ includes a linear term multiplied by the squared logarithm.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is self-explanatory, and the assumptions are just the integral setups. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. So here, maybe the two integrals are considered, each as a separate assumption. But the example had one problem with two conditions. Here, two integrals. But the example's format requires listing all assumptions line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- Consider the integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx$.\n- Consider the integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/3}x\\log^2 \\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx$.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were conditions on n. Here, the problem is to evaluate two integrals. So maybe the assumptions are the existence of the integrals. But the problem as stated is to compute them. Alternatively, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. In that case, the formatted problem would list the problem as is, with the integrals, and the assumptions would be the intervals and integrands. Since the example's formatted problem included the assumption even if it was part of the problem, here's my best attempt:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integration interval is $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n- The integrand involves $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n- The integrand involves $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{7\\pi^3}{108}, \\\\\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3}x\\log^2 \\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{17\\pi^4}{6480}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- The first integral is over the interval $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n- The integrand of the first integral is $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n- The second integral is over the interval $[0, \\pi/3]$.\n- The integrand of the second integral is $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Alternatively, since the problem has two separate integrals, maybe each integral is considered a separate assumption. But according to the example, each assumption is a single condition. The example had two assumptions for one problem. Here, perhaps four assumptions (two integrals, each with two parts). However, that might be overcomplicating. Given the user's example, the original problem had two assumptions for one problem. Here, the problem is to compute two integrals, so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The first integral is $\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx$.\n- The second integral is $\\int_0^{\\pi/3}x\\log^2 \\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the first integral equals $\\frac{7\\pi^3}{108}$ and the second integral equals $\\frac{17\\pi^4}{6480}$.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is written as a single problem. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integration interval is $[0, \\pi/3]$ for both integrals.\n- The integrands involve $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$ and $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{7\\pi^3}{108}, \\\\\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3}x\\log^2 \\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{17\\pi^4}{6480}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBut each assumption must be a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- Both integrals are evaluated over $x$ from $0$ to $\\pi/3$.\n- The first integrand is $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n- The second integrand is $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve the equalities:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{7\\pi^3}{108}, \\\\\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3}x\\log^2 \\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{17\\pi^4}{6480}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis seems to fit the example's structure where each assumption is a separate line addressing one aspect. The example had two assumptions for the problem. Here, we have three assumptions (integration interval, first integrand, second integrand). But the problem is to prove both equalities. Alternatively, maybe the integration interval is common, so one assumption, and then each integrand as separate assumptions. That would be three assumptions. However, the example had two assumptions for one problem. Let's see:\n\nThe example's formatted problem had:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem: Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\n\nSo two assumptions for one problem. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- $x$ is integrated from $0$ to $\\pi/3$.\n- The first integrand is $\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n- The second integrand is $x\\log^2\\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{7\\pi^3}{108}, \\\\\n\\int_0^{\\pi/3}x\\log^2 \\left(2\\sin\\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx &= \\frac{17\\pi^4}{6480}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis should be acceptable. Each assumption is one line, addressing one aspect. The first line sets the integration limits for both integrals, the next two lines define each integrand. Then the problem is to show the equalities. Even though in the example, assumptions were conditions on variables, here, the integration interval is part of the problem setup.
