    "Content": "This question on MSE asked the following: \"Given $x,y,z \\in \\mathbb{N},$ find probability that $x^2+y^2+z^2$ is divisible by $7.$\" The OP did not declare the assumed probability model, and was duly criticised for that. On the other hand, it is only natural to assume that $x$, $y$, $z$ are independently uniformly distributed mod $7$. A case analysis then shows that that the  probability in question is ${1\\over7}$. This simple result led me to solve the same problem for the primes $p=3$, $5$, $11$, and $13$. In each case I obtained ${1\\over p}$ as result. Further experiments showed that the remainder of $s=x^2+y^2+z^2$ mod $p$ is not uniformly distributed mod $p$, but that in any case the probability of $s=0$ mod $p$ is equal to ${1\\over p}$ for all $p\\leq107$. This leads to the following Conjecture. Let the integeres $x$, $y$, $z$ be independently uniformly distributed modulo the prime $p$. Then the probability that $s:=x^2+y^2+z^2$  is divisible by $p$ is equal to ${1\\over p}$. Maybe this well known. Otherwise I'd like to see a proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The user mentions a probability problem where x, y, z are integers, and they want the probability that x² + y² + z² ≡ 0 mod p, with p being a prime. The original poster (OP) didn't specify the probability model, but the responder assumes that x, y, z are independently and uniformly distributed modulo p. Through experiments with primes up to 107, the probability seems to be 1/p, leading to a conjecture.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. Let's list the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nThe main assumptions here are:\n1. x, y, z are integers. (But wait, in the problem, they are considered modulo p, so maybe it's more precise to say they are integers modulo p?)\n2. x, y, z are independently distributed. Each variable is independent of the others.\n3. Each of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p. So each has an equal probability of being any residue mod p.\n4. p is a prime number. The problem is about primes, as mentioned in the conjecture.\n\nThe problem is to prove (or determine whether) the probability that x² + y² + z² ≡ 0 mod p is equal to 1/p.\n\nWait, let me check the original text again. The conjecture states that under the given conditions, the probability is 1/p. So the problem is to prove that probability equals 1/p.\n\nNow, the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each on separate lines. So here, similarly, each assumption should be separate.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: x, y, z are integers. (But maybe more accurately, they are residues mod p. The problem states they are \"independently uniformly distributed mod p\". So perhaps the assumption is that x, y, z are integers modulo p. But the original variables are in N, but considered mod p. So maybe the assumptions should be that x, y, z are chosen uniformly at random from the residues mod p. However, the user's example used \"n is an integer\", so maybe here it's similar: x, y, z are integers, and they're considered modulo p. Wait, but the problem says \"independently uniformly distributed mod p\", so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x, y, z are integers.\n- x, y, z are independently distributed.\n- x, y, z are uniformly distributed modulo p.\n- p is a prime number.\n\nBut maybe the first assumption is redundant because if they are uniformly distributed modulo p, they are integers modulo p. Hmm. The example in the user's instruction had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here, \"x, y, z are integers\" is one assumption, and \"each of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p\" is another. But the original problem in the example had n as an integer, which is an assumption, but here the variables are integers but modulo p. However, the key is that each variable is uniformly distributed over the residues mod p. So perhaps the main assumptions are:\n\n- p is a prime number.\n- x, y, z are integers chosen independently.\n- Each of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p.\n\nWait, \"integers chosen\" but modulo p. The problem says \"independently uniformly distributed modulo p\". So maybe the correct way is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a prime number.\n- x, y, z are integers modulo p.\n- x, y, z are independently distributed.\n- The distribution of each of x, y, z is uniform over the residues modulo p.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition. So:\n\nAssumption 1: p is a prime number.\nAssumption 2: x, y, z are integers modulo p.\nAssumption 3: x, y, z are independently distributed.\nAssumption 4: The distribution of x is uniform modulo p.\nAssumption 5: The distribution of y is uniform modulo p.\nAssumption 6: The distribution of z is uniform modulo p.\n\nWait, but maybe the uniformity applies to all three variables. In the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, maybe:\n\nAssumption 1: p is a prime number.\nAssumption 2: x is an integer modulo p.\nAssumption 3: y is an integer modulo p.\nAssumption 4: z is an integer modulo p.\nAssumption 5: x is uniformly distributed modulo p.\nAssumption 6: y is uniformly distributed modulo p.\nAssumption 7: z is uniformly distributed modulo p.\nAssumption 8: x, y, z are independently distributed.\n\nBut that might be too granular. However, the user's example had two separate assumptions for n: being integer and being divisible by 7. So here, for each variable, maybe their type (integer modulo p) and their distribution (uniform) are separate. However, the problem says \"independently uniformly distributed mod p\", so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- x, y, z are integers modulo p.\n- x, y, z are independent.\n- Each of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p.\n\nBut in the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\", then \"n is divisible by 7\". So for each variable, if needed. But perhaps in this problem, since x, y, z are all treated similarly, maybe it's acceptable to group them. However, the user's instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"x, y, z are integers modulo p\" is three objects, but one condition. Hmm, maybe that's not allowed. The example had \"n is an integer\" as a single line, so for each variable, we need to list their properties individually. But that might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps \"x, y, z are integers modulo p\" as a single assumption. Then \"each of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p\" as another, and \"x, y, z are independent\" as another. Then \"p is a prime\". So four assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user would prefer:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number,\nx, y, z are integers modulo p,\nx, y, z are independent,\nx is uniformly distributed modulo p,\ny is uniformly distributed modulo p,\nz is uniformly distributed modulo p.\n\nBut that might be more aligned with the instruction of each line addressing one property or condition for one object. So each variable's distribution is a separate assumption. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So here, each variable's uniform distribution would need separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number,\nx is an integer modulo p,\ny is an integer modulo p,\nz is an integer modulo p,\nx is uniformly distributed modulo p,\ny is uniformly distributed modulo p,\nz is uniformly distributed modulo p,\nx, y, z are independent.\n\nBut that seems excessive. However, following the user's example, perhaps that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe grouping is allowed if the variables are treated the same. The user's example grouped \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, x, y, z are all integers modulo p, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number,\nx, y, z are integers modulo p,\nx, y, z are independent,\neach of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p.\n\nBut the instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So \"each of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p\" is three properties in one line. That might not be allowed. Therefore, to adhere strictly, each variable's distribution should be listed separately. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number,\nx is an integer modulo p,\ny is an integer modulo p,\nz is an integer modulo p,\nx is uniformly distributed modulo p,\ny is uniformly distributed modulo p,\nz is uniformly distributed modulo p,\nx, y, z are independent.\n\nBut maybe \"x, y, z are integers modulo p\" can be considered one assumption, covering all three variables. Similarly, \"x, y, z are independent\" is one assumption. Then the uniformity per variable. Wait, but in the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So for n, two properties. Here, for x, y, z: each being integers modulo p is one assumption (per variable?), but since they are grouped, maybe not. The user's instruction isn't entirely clear, but perhaps the safest way is to list each variable's properties if they are separate. But given that the example grouped \"n is an integer\" as a single line, perhaps here we can group \"x, y, z are integers modulo p\" as a single line, then \"x, y, z are independent\", then \"each is uniformly distributed modulo p\" as another line. But the instruction says each line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So if we say \"x, y, z are integers modulo p\", that's three objects (x, y, z) with one property each (being integers modulo p). But maybe the user allows grouping. Alternatively, the example's \"n is an integer\" is one line, so here, each variable would need their own line. But that would make the assumptions lengthy. However, to comply with the example's style, perhaps the following is acceptable:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number,\nx, y, z are integers modulo p,\nx, y, z are independent,\nx is uniformly distributed modulo p,\ny is uniformly distributed modulo p,\nz is uniformly distributed modulo p.\n\nBut this way, each uniformity is per variable. Alternatively, if uniformity applies to all three, maybe \"each of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p\" as one line. The problem is that the user's instruction isn't explicit on whether grouping is allowed. The example grouped \"n is an integer\" and another line. So perhaps it's allowed. Let me proceed with:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number,\nx, y, z are integers modulo p,\nx, y, z are independent,\neach of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p.\n\nThis seems concise and covers all conditions. Now, the problem statement is to prove that the probability that x² + y² + z² ≡ 0 mod p is equal to 1/p. So the problem line would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the probability that $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ is $\\frac{1}{p}$.\n\nLet me double-check. The original conjecture is that under these conditions, the probability is 1/p. So yes, the problem is to prove that. The assumptions are that p is prime, variables are integers mod p, independent, and each uniformly distributed. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should look like this:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \np is a prime number,\nx, y, z are integers modulo p,\nx, y, z are independent,\neach of x, y, z is uniformly distributed modulo p.\nProblem: Prove that the probability that $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ is $\\frac{1}{p}$.",
