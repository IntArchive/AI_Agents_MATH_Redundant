Firstly, split the numbers $\\{1,2,\\dots,100\\}$ into three sets upon their divisibility by $5$.For $k=0,1,2$ $S_k$ be the set numbers $n$ between $1$ and $100$ (both inclusive) such that $k$ is the highest power of $5$ that divides $n$.\nThen, $$S_0=\\{1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,\\dots,96,97,98,99\\}$$ $$S_1=\\{5,10,15,20,30,\\dots,70,80,85,90,95\\}$$ $$S_2=\\{25,50,75,100\\}$$ Now, let $A_k$ for $k=0,1,2$ be defined as $$A_0=100!\\left(1+\\frac 12+\\frac 13+\\frac 14+\\frac 17+\\dots+\\frac 1{96}+\\frac 1{97}+\\frac 1{98}+\\frac 1{99}\\right)$$\n$$A_1=100!\\left(\\frac 15+\\frac 1{10}+\\frac 1{15}+\\frac 1{20}+\\frac 1{30}+\\dots+\\frac 1{85}+\\frac1{90}+\\frac 1{95}\\right)$$\n$$A_2=100!\\left(\\frac 1{25}+\\frac 1{50}+\\frac 1{75}+\\frac 1{100}\\right)$$ Then, $A_0,A_1,A_2$ are all integers, and $$\\frac AB=\\frac {A_0+A_1+A_2}{100!}\\tag1$$ Now, $$A_2=\\frac {100!}{25}\\left(1+\\frac 12+\\frac 13+\\frac 14\\right)=\\frac {100!}{25}\\times\\frac {25}{12}=\\frac {100!}{12}.$$ Let, $power(a,b)$ denotes the highest power of $a$ that divides $b$. Then, $$\\color{blue}{power(5,A_2)=20+4=24}$$(one can easily verify, since $\\gcd(5,12)=1$, $power(5,A_2)=power(5,100!)$). Now, let $$N=\\frac 1{5n+1}+\\frac 1{5n+2}+\\frac 1{5n+3}+\\frac 1{5n+4}=\\frac{50(2n+1)(5n^2+5n+1)}{(5n+1)(5n+2)(5n+3)(5n+4)}.$$ So, the denominator is indivisible by $5$, also $(5n^2+5n+1)$. Hence $power(5,N)\\ge 2$, for the factor $50$ in the numerator (as there is no multiple of $5$ in the denominator, $50$ will never cancel out). Now, $$A_1=\\frac {100!}5\\left[\\left(1+\\frac 12+\\frac 13+\\frac 14\\right)+\\dots+\\left(\\frac1{16}+\\frac 1{17}+\\frac 1{18}+\\frac1{19}\\right)\\right]$$ So, we have $$\\color{blue}{power(5,A_1)\\ge24-1+2=25}$$ Similarly, $$A_0=100!\\left[\\left(1+\\frac12+\\frac13+\\frac14\\right)+\\dots+\\left(\\frac 1{96}+\\frac 1{97}+\\frac 1{98}+\\frac 1{99}\\right)\\right]$$ So, $$\\color{blue}{power(5,A_0)\\ge24+2=26}$$ From the three $\\color{blue}{emphasized}$ consequences, we can say that $$\\color{red}{power(5,A_0+A_1+A_2)=24}$$(one may feel confused here, but earlier I said $power(5,A_0)\\ge24+2=26$ and $power(5,A_1)\\ge24-1+2=25$, note that if greater power of $5$ than $24$ divides a quantity, then the power $24$ also divides that quantity).

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The problem states that the harmonic series up to 1/100, when expressed as a reduced fraction A/B, neither A nor B is divisible by 5. The user also provided the specific numerator and denominator from Mathematica, but obviously, we can't rely on that for a proof. So, I need to figure out a way to show that 5 doesn't divide either A or B.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when you sum fractions, the denominator of the sum in reduced form is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the denominators. So, B should be the LCM of 1, 2, 3, ..., 100. But since we are reducing the fraction, B would actually be the LCM divided by any common factors in the numerators. However, since each term is 1/k, the numerator of each term is 1, so when adding them all up, the numerator would be the sum of the LCM divided by each k. Therefore, the denominator B in reduced form is the LCM of 1 through 100 divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of that sum and the LCM. But since we are told that A and B are coprime, B must be the LCM divided by any common factors between the sum and the LCM. So, the key here is to analyze the factors of the LCM and the sum.\n\nThe LCM of numbers from 1 to 100 is the product of the highest powers of primes up to 100. For prime 5, the highest power less than or equal to 100 is 5^2 = 25, since 5^3 = 125 is too big. So, the LCM includes 5^2. Similarly, for prime 2, it's 2^6 (since 2^7=128>100), and so on.\n\nNow, the problem wants to show that after reducing the fraction to lowest terms, neither the numerator A nor the denominator B is divisible by 5. That means that in the reduced fraction, the factor 5 cancels out completely. However, since the LCM (which is the initial denominator before reduction) includes 5^2, but after reduction, B doesn't have a 5, that would mean that the numerator sum must have had a factor of 5^2, so that when dividing by the GCD (which would be 5^2), the denominator becomes LCM / 5^2, removing all factors of 5. But wait, the problem states neither A nor B is divisible by 5, which would mean that in the reduced form, both A and B are coprime to 5. That suggests that all factors of 5 in the numerator and denominator have been canceled out. Therefore, the GCD of the numerator sum and the LCM must include 5^2, so that dividing both numerator and denominator by the GCD removes the 5s from both.\n\nBut how do we show that the GCD includes 5^2? Alternatively, perhaps we can use modular arithmetic to show that the numerator is divisible by 25 (5^2), but the denominator isn't divisible by 5 after reduction. Wait, but the denominator initially has 5^2. If the numerator is divisible by 5^2, then the GCD would be at least 5^2, so when we divide both numerator and denominator by the GCD, the denominator would have LCM divided by GCD, which would remove the 5^2, making B not divisible by 5. Similarly, the numerator would have A = (sum) / GCD, and if sum is divisible by 5^2 and GCD is 5^2, then A would not be divisible by 5. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use Wolstenholme's theorem, which states that for a prime p ≥ 5, the harmonic series H_{p-1} has a numerator divisible by p^2. But 100 is not a prime, so maybe that's not directly applicable. However, 100 is 5^2 * 4. So perhaps there's a generalized version or a similar approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider looking at the harmonic series modulo 25. If we can show that the numerator is divisible by 25, then since the denominator (LCM) has 25 as a factor, then the reduced denominator would have 25 divided by the GCD(25, numerator). If the numerator is divisible by 25, then the GCD is at least 25, so the denominator's 25 is canceled out, leaving B without any factors of 5. Similarly, the numerator A would be (original numerator)/GCD, which would be (25k)/25 = k, so if the original numerator was exactly divisible by 25, then A would not be divisible by 5. But we need to ensure that the numerator is divisible by 25 but not by 125, perhaps? Or maybe it's divisible by higher powers? Wait, but the problem just needs to show that neither A nor B is divisible by 5, so even if the numerator was divisible by higher powers, after division by GCD, A would not be divisible by 5.\n\nSo, the key is to show that the numerator sum is divisible by 25, which would mean that the GCD includes 25, leading to B = LCM / GCD, which removes the 25 from the denominator, hence B is not divisible by 5. Similarly, A = sum / GCD, which would be sum / 25, so if sum is divisible by 25 but not 125, then A is not divisible by 5. If sum is divisible by 125, then A might still not be, depending on the exact power.\n\nTherefore, the approach would be to compute the harmonic sum modulo 25 and show that it is 0. If the numerator is divisible by 25, then 25 divides the numerator, hence GCD(numerator, LCM) includes 25, so denominator B is LCM / GCD, which would have no factors of 5. Hence, neither A nor B is divisible by 5.\n\nTo compute the harmonic sum modulo 25, we can use properties of modular inverses. However, calculating H_100 mod 25 directly might be tedious, but perhaps we can find symmetries or use known theorems.\n\nAlternatively, note that Wolstenholme's theorem says that for prime p ≥ 5, the harmonic sum H_{p-1} is congruent to 0 mod p^3. Here, p=5, so H_{4} would be 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. But our sum goes up to 1/100. However, perhaps we can extend this. Let's see:\n\nH_100 = H_4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + ... + 1/100.\n\nThe terms from 1/5 to 1/100 can be grouped by denominators divisible by 5 and those not. Let’s denote S = H_100.\n\nSplit S into terms where denominator is divisible by 5 and those not:\n\nS = (terms not divisible by 5) + (terms divisible by 5).\n\nThe terms divisible by 5 can be written as (1/5 + 1/10 + 1/15 + ... + 1/100) = (1/5)(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/20). Let's call this (1/5)H_{20}.\n\nSimilarly, H_{100} = (terms not divisible by 5) + (1/5)H_{20}.\n\nNow, H_{20} can itself be split into terms divisible by 5 and not. So:\n\nH_{20} = (terms not divisible by 5) + (1/5)H_4.\n\nTherefore, H_{100} = (terms not divisible by 5 from 1 to 100) + (1/5)[ (terms not divisible by 5 from 1 to 20) + (1/5)H_4 ].\n\nBut this seems recursive. However, when considering modulo 25, perhaps we can handle each part.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider the entire sum modulo 25. Let's represent each term 1/k as k^{-1} mod 25. Since 25 is 5^2, we need to be careful with inverses. For k not divisible by 5, k has an inverse modulo 25. For k divisible by 5, 1/k is not an integer, but when combined with the LCM denominator, perhaps these terms contribute to the numerator in a way that makes the entire sum divisible by 25.\n\nAlternatively, consider the harmonic sum written with a common denominator of LCM(1,2,...,100). The numerator is the sum of LCM(1,2,...,100)/k for k=1 to 100. Let's denote N = sum_{k=1}^{100} LCM / k. Then A/B = N / LCM, reduced. So we need to show that 5 does not divide N (the numerator) nor LCM / gcd(N, LCM) (the denominator B). Wait, but if LCM includes 5^2, and if N is divisible by 5^2, then gcd(N, LCM) would include 5^2, so LCM / gcd(N, LCM) would have LCM divided by 5^2, hence B would not have any 5s. Similarly, N / gcd(N, LCM) would be N / 5^2, which if N is divisible by 5^2 but not 5^3, then A would not be divisible by 5. If N is divisible by higher powers, then A might still be divisible by 5, but the problem states neither A nor B is divisible by 5. Therefore, we need to show that N is divisible by 5^2, but not by 5^3. Alternatively, that the exponent of 5 in N is exactly 2.\n\nBut how to compute the exponent of 5 in N?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that when considering the harmonic series modulo 5^2, the sum is congruent to 0. If H_100 ≡ 0 mod 25, then the numerator N = H_100 * LCM is divisible by 25, but LCM is divisible by 25, so N is LCM * H_100. Wait, no. Actually, H_100 is N / LCM. So N = H_100 * LCM. If H_100 is a fraction in reduced form, then N = sum of LCM/k, which is an integer. Therefore, N = sum_{k=1}^{100} LCM/k.\n\nTo compute the exponent of 5 in N, we need to see how many times 5 divides each term LCM/k, then sum them up modulo 5. But this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, note that for each term LCM/k, LCM has 5^2 in its factorization. If k is not divisible by 5, then LCM/k has 5^2 in its factors, so each such term is divisible by 5^2. If k is divisible by 5 but not 25, then LCM/k has 5^{2-1} = 5^1. If k is divisible by 25, then LCM/k has 5^{2-2} = 5^0. So, the terms where k is not divisible by 5 contribute multiples of 25, terms where k is divisible by 5 but not 25 contribute multiples of 5, and terms divisible by 25 contribute units.\n\nTherefore, sum_{k=1}^{100} LCM/k = sum_{k not divisible by 5} (multiple of 25) + sum_{k divisible by 5 but not 25} (multiple of 5) + sum_{k divisible by 25} (not divisible by 5).\n\nLet’s compute how many terms are in each category:\n\nNumbers not divisible by 5: from 1 to 100, there are 80 numbers (since 100/5=20, so 100-20=80).\n\nNumbers divisible by 5 but not 25: there are 20 numbers divisible by 5, and 4 of them are divisible by 25 (25,50,75,100), so 20-4=16.\n\nNumbers divisible by 25: 4.\n\nTherefore, sum = 80*(multiples of 25) + 16*(multiples of 5) + 4*(units).\n\nNow, when we sum all these, each term in the first group is divisible by 25, so their sum is divisible by 25. The second group has 16 terms each divisible by 5, so their sum is divisible by 5*16=80, which is 5*16. Since 80 is divisible by 5 but not necessarily by 25. The third group is 4 terms not divisible by 5.\n\nTherefore, the total sum N = 25A + 5B + C, where A is an integer, B=16*(something), and C=4*(something). Therefore, modulo 25, N ≡ 5B + C mod 25. To show that N is divisible by 25, we need 5B + C ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nBut we need to compute B and C modulo 5. Let's see:\n\nEach term in the second group (divisible by 5 but not 25) is LCM/k, where k=5m, m not divisible by 5. LCM includes 5^2, so LCM/k = (5^2 * other factors)/ (5m) )=5 * (other factors)/m. Since m is not divisible by 5, and LCM includes the highest power of primes in m, so (other factors)/m is an integer. Therefore, each term in the second group is divisible by 5, but not necessarily by 25. So when we sum 16 terms of multiples of 5, the total sum B is 5*(sum of integers), so B=5D for some integer D. Therefore, 5B=5*(5D)=25D, which is divisible by 25.\n\nWait, but wait: each term in the second group is LCM/k = 5*(something), so when we sum 16 terms, each being 5*(something), the total sum for the second group is 5*(sum of those somethings). Therefore, 5B here would be 5*(sum of the second group) = 5*(5*(sum...))=25*(sum...), which is divisible by 25. Then the third group is 4 terms which are LCM/k where k=25m. LCM includes 25, so LCM/k = 25*(other factors)/(25m) = (other factors)/m. Since m is 1,2,3,4 (as k=25,50,75,100), so m=1,2,3,4. LCM includes the highest power of primes in m, so for m=1, LCM/k=1; for m=2, LCM/k includes 2^6/2=2^5, etc. But importantly, these terms are integers not divisible by 5 because m is not divisible by 5. Therefore, the sum of the third group is 4 terms, each not divisible by 5, so their sum modulo 5 is sum of 4 numbers each from 1 to 4 mod 5. But actually, the exact values depend on LCM/k.\n\nWait, but LCM is the LCM of 1-100, which includes 2^6, 3^4, 5^2, etc. For k=25, LCM/k = LCM /25. Similarly for k=50=25*2, LCM/k = LCM/(25*2) = LCM/(25)/2. Since LCM is divisible by 25 and 2^6, so LCM/k for k=25 is LCM/25, which is an integer divisible by 2^6, 3^4, etc., but not by 5. Similarly, LCM/k for k=50 is LCM/(25*2) which is still divisible by 2^5, 3^4, etc., but not by 5. Similarly for 75=25*3 and 100=25*4. Therefore, each term in the third group is an integer not divisible by 5. Therefore, their sum is the sum of four integers not divisible by 5. Let's denote them as C1, C2, C3, C4, each ≡ non-zero mod 5. The sum C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 mod 5. Since each Ci ≡ 1,2,3, or 4 mod 5, their sum could be anything. However, we need to determine whether this sum is ≡ 0 mod 5.\n\nBut since we already have the first two groups contributing 25A + 25D, so N = 25(A + D) + (C1 + C2 + C3 + C4). Therefore, N ≡ (C1 + C2 + C3 + C4) mod 25. If we can show that this sum ≡ 0 mod 5, then N ≡ 0 mod 5, but we need N ≡ 0 mod 25. Wait, no. If the first two groups are divisible by 25, then N ≡ C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 mod 25. Therefore, to have N divisible by 25, we need C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 ≡ 0 mod 25. But since each Ci is not divisible by 5, their sum can't be 0 mod 25 unless they sum up to a multiple of 25. However, since there are only four terms, each at least 1, the sum is at least 4 and at most, say, 4*(something large). But without exact values, it's hard to say. Wait, but maybe there's a symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of the four terms C1 to C4 is divisible by 25. How?\n\nWait, but in reality, since LCM/k for k=25,50,75,100:\n\nLet’s compute LCM(1-100)/25. LCM(1-100) is divisible by all numbers up to 100, so LCM/25 is divisible by all numbers up to 100 except multiples of 25. So LCM/25 is LCM(1-100) divided by 25, which is still divisible by 2^6,3^4,5^0, etc. Similarly, LCM/(25*2)=LCM/50, which is divisible by 2^5,3^4,5^0, etc. Therefore, each term LCM/k for k=25,50,75,100 is divisible by high powers of 2 and 3 but not by 5. Therefore, each Ci is an integer not divisible by 5. Therefore, their sum modulo 5 is (C1 + C2 + C3 + C4) mod 5. Since each Ci ≡ non-zero mod 5, their sum could be 0 mod 5. For example, if C1=1, C2=2, C3=3, C4=4, sum=10 ≡ 0 mod 5. But without knowing the actual values, we need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the entire harmonic sum H_100 can be written as a fraction where the denominator is LCM(1-100). The numerator is sum_{k=1}^{100} LCM/k. We need to show that when reduced, neither numerator nor denominator has a factor of 5. This is equivalent to showing that 5 divides neither the numerator nor the denominator after reduction. Since the denominator before reduction is LCM, which has 5^2. So if the GCD of numerator and LCM includes 5^2, then denominator after reduction is LCM / GCD, which would have 5^{2 - 2}=5^0, so no 5s. Similarly, the numerator after reduction is numerator / GCD, which would have 5^{2 - 2}=5^0, so no 5s. Therefore, the key is to show that 5^2 divides the numerator sum.\n\nTherefore, if we can show that the numerator sum is divisible by 5^2, then the GCD includes 5^2, leading to both A and B being coprime to 5.\n\nTo show that the numerator sum is divisible by 5^2, we can analyze the sum modulo 25. If the sum is congruent to 0 modulo 25, then it's divisible by 25.\n\nAs earlier, the numerator sum N = sum_{k=1}^{100} LCM/k. Let's consider N modulo 25. As before, split the sum into three parts: terms not divisible by 5, terms divisible by 5 but not 25, and terms divisible by 25.\n\nFor terms not divisible by 5 (80 terms), LCM/k is divisible by 25, so each term ≡ 0 mod 25. Therefore, their sum ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nFor terms divisible by 5 but not 25 (16 terms), LCM/k = LCM/(5m) where m not divisible by 5. LCM includes 5^2, so LCM/(5m) = 5*(LCM/(5^2 m)). Since LCM includes all prime factors up to 100, LCM/(5^2 m) is an integer, so LCM/(5m) = 5*(integer), so each term is divisible by 5 but not necessarily by 25. Therefore, their sum is 16 terms each ≡ 5c_i mod 25, where c_i is some integer. The sum is 5*(sum c_i) mod 25. Let's denote sum c_i ≡ S mod 5. Then 5*(sum c_i) ≡ 5S mod 25. If S ≡ 0 mod 5, then this sum ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nFor terms divisible by 25 (4 terms), LCM/k = LCM/(25m) where m=1,2,3,4. LCM includes 25, so LCM/(25m) = (LCM/25)/m. Since LCM/25 is divisible by all primes up to 100 except 5, and m divides LCM/25, so each term is an integer. Let's denote these terms as T1, T2, T3, T4. The sum T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 modulo 25 needs to be considered.\n\nTherefore, total sum N ≡ 0 + 5S + (T1 + T2 + T3 + T4) mod 25.\n\nTo have N ≡ 0 mod 25, we need 5S + (T1 + T2 + T3 + T4) ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nWe need to compute S and the sum T_i modulo 25.\n\nFirst, compute S = sum c_i mod 5. Each c_i is LCM/(5^2 m_i), where m_i is from 1 to 20, not divisible by 5. Wait, actually, when k=5m, m from 1 to 20, but excluding m divisible by 5 (since k not divisible by 25). So m ranges 1-20, m ≠ multiples of 5. Therefore, m=1-4,6-9,11-14,16-19. Total 16 terms.\n\nTherefore, c_i = LCM/(5^2 m_i). Since LCM is divisible by 5^2, LCM/(5^2) is an integer. Then c_i = LCM/(5^2 m_i) = (LCM/5^2)/m_i. LCM/5^2 is the LCM of 1-100 divided by 25, which includes all prime factors except 5. Since m_i ranges from 1-20 not divisible by 5, LCM/5^2 is divisible by each m_i, so c_i is an integer. Therefore, sum c_i is sum of integers, and we need to find S = sum c_i mod 5.\n\nHowever, calculating this sum directly seems difficult. Instead, perhaps we can use properties of the harmonic series modulo primes. For example, Wolstenholme's theorem says that for prime p ≥ 5, the harmonic sum H_{p-1} ≡ 0 mod p^3. Here, p=5, so H_4 ≡ 0 mod 5^3=125. But our sum is H_100, which includes H_4 plus other terms. But H_4 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. According to Wolstenholme's theorem, this sum has numerator divisible by 5^3=125. However, we need to relate this to our sum.\n\nAlternatively, consider that H_100 = H_4 + H_5^{20}, where H_5^{20} is the sum from 1/5 to 1/100. But I'm not sure if this helps. Let's think differently.\n\nSince H_100 = (sum_{k=1}^{100} 1/k), when expressed with denominator LCM, the numerator is sum_{k=1}^{100} LCM/k. To check if this sum is divisible by 25, we can consider it modulo 25.\n\nAs before, split into three parts:\n\n1. Terms not divisible by 5: 80 terms, each LCM/k ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\n2. Terms divisible by 5 but not 25: 16 terms, each LCM/k = 5*(integer), so ≡ 5c_i mod 25. The sum of these is 5*(sum c_i) mod 25.\n\n3. Terms divisible by 25: 4 terms, each LCM/k = integer not divisible by 5. Let's denote their sum as T mod 25.\n\nSo total sum N ≡ 0 + 5S + T mod 25.\n\nFrom Wolstenholme's theorem, H_4 has numerator divisible by 125, so H_4 = a/24 where a is divisible by 125. But this might not directly help. Alternatively, consider that when we consider the entire sum H_100, perhaps it's congruent to 0 mod 25. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider working modulo 5. If we can show that the numerator sum is divisible by 25, then it's divisible by 5^2. To check divisibility by 25, we need to show N ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nBut to compute N mod 25, we need to compute the sum of LCM/k mod 25 for k=1 to 100. However, LCM is divisible by 25, so LCM/k is divisible by 25 when k is not divisible by 5. When k is divisible by 5 but not 25, LCM/k is divisible by 5. When k is divisible by 25, LCM/k is not divisible by 5.\n\nBut LCM/k is an integer for all k. Let's denote:\n\nFor k not divisible by 5: LCM/k ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nFor k divisible by 5 but not 25: LCM/k ≡ 0 mod 5 but not 0 mod 25.\n\nFor k divisible by 25: LCM/k ≡ some integer mod 25 not divisible by 5.\n\nTherefore, sum N mod 25 is equal to sum_{k divisible by 5 but not 25} (LCM/k mod 25) + sum_{k divisible by 25} (LCM/k mod 25).\n\nLet’s compute these two sums separately.\n\nFirst, sum_{k divisible by 5 but not 25} (LCM/k mod 25). There are 16 such terms. Each term LCM/k = LCM/(5m) where m not divisible by 5. Since LCM includes 5^2, LCM/(5m) = 5*(LCM/(5^2 m)). LCM/(5^2 m) is an integer, so LCM/k = 5*(integer). Let’s denote LCM/(5^2 m) = M/m, where M = LCM/5^2, which is divisible by all primes except 5 up to their highest powers. Since m ranges from 1 to 20 not divisible by 5, M/m is an integer. Therefore, LCM/k = 5*(M/m). Therefore, LCM/k mod 25 is 5*(M/m mod 5).\n\nTherefore, each term LCM/k mod 25 is 5*(M/m mod 5). The sum over these terms is 5*(sum_{m} (M/m mod 5)) mod 25.\n\nNow, M is LCM/5^2, which is divisible by all numbers from 1 to 100 except multiples of 25. Therefore, M is divisible by all m from 1 to 20 not divisible by 5. Hence, M/m is an integer. To compute M/m mod 5, note that M is divisible by m, so M/m is congruent to some integer modulo 5. Let's denote M/m ≡ a_m mod 5. Then sum_{m} a_m mod 5.\n\nBut since M is divisible by m, and m ranges over 1-20 not divisible by 5, which are coprime to 5, we can write M/m ≡ (M mod 5m)/m mod 5. However, since M is LCM/25, which includes factors like 2^6, 3^4, etc., but not 5. The exact value of M mod 5 is not straightforward. However, note that M is divisible by 2^6, 3^4, 7^2, etc. But modulo 5, M is congruent to the product of the primes other than 5 raised to their respective powers modulo 5. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since M is divisible by all m in the denominators (since m divides M), then M/m is an integer. Therefore, when we reduce M/m mod 5, we're looking for the inverse of m mod 5 multiplied by M mod 5. Wait, but M is divisible by m, so M/m ≡ 0 mod the factors of m. But since m and 5 are coprime, m has an inverse mod 5. However, this approach might not work directly.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the sum we're interested in is sum_{m} (M/m mod 5), which is equivalent to sum_{m} (M mod 5m)/m mod 5. Since M is divisible by m, M mod 5m is congruent to 0 mod m, so (M mod 5m)/m is congruent to 0 mod 1. However, this doesn't directly help.\n\nThis seems too abstract. Maybe an alternative approach is needed.\n\nRecall that the original problem is to show that neither A nor B is divisible by 5. Another approach could be to use the properties of the harmonic series and the concept of p-adic valuations. Let's denote v_5(n) as the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n.\n\nFor the denominator B, which is LCM(1,2,...,100)/gcd(N, LCM), where N is the numerator sum. Since LCM has v_5(LCM) = 2, we need to show that v_5(gcd(N, LCM)) = 2, which would imply v_5(B) = 2 - 2 = 0, so B is not divisible by 5. Similarly, v_5(N) = 2, so v_5(A) = v_5(N) - v_5(gcd(N, LCM)) = 2 - 2 = 0, so A is not divisible by 5.\n\nTherefore, we need to show that v_5(N) = 2 and v_5(LCM) = 2, so gcd(N, LCM) has v_5 = 2.\n\nTo compute v_5(N), where N = sum_{k=1}^{100} LCM/k.\n\nEach term LCM/k has v_5(LCM/k) = v_5(LCM) - v_5(k) = 2 - v_5(k).\n\nTherefore:\n\n- If k is not divisible by 5, v_5(LCM/k) = 2 - 0 = 2. So each such term contributes +2 to the exponent of 5 in N. But wait, v_5(N) is the minimum exponent of 5 in any term? No, actually, when summing integers, the valuation v_5(N) is the minimum valuation of the individual terms. But that's only if all terms have the same valuation. If terms have different valuations, then v_5(N) is at least the minimum valuation, but could be higher if there is cancellation.\n\nWait, no. The valuation v_5(N) is the largest integer m such that 5^m divides N. To compute v_5(N), we need to find the smallest valuation among the terms. Wait, no, that's for the minimum. For example, if you have two terms, one divisible by 5^2 and one divisible by 5^1, their sum is divisible by 5^1, but not necessarily by 5^2. So the valuation is at least the minimum valuation of the terms. However, if there are enough terms with higher valuation that cancel out the lower ones, the valuation could be higher.\n\nThis complicates things. Therefore, to find v_5(N), we need to find the smallest k such that 5^k divides all terms, but that's not correct either. Actually, valuation is determined by the highest power of 5 dividing the sum. To compute this, we can use the following method:\n\n1. For each term in the sum, compute its contribution modulo 5^m for increasing m until the sum is not congruent to 0 modulo 5^{m+1}.\n\nIn our case, we need to find the largest m such that 5^m divides N. We suspect m=2.\n\nTo compute v_5(N), we can use the following steps:\n\n- Check if N is divisible by 5. This is true if the sum of the terms modulo 5 is 0.\n\n- If yes, check divisibility by 25. If the sum modulo 25 is 0, then it's divisible by 25, and so on.\n\nSo let's compute N modulo 25.\n\nAs before, split the sum into three parts:\n\n1. Terms not divisible by 5: 80 terms, each divisible by 25, so sum ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\n2. Terms divisible by 5 but not 25: 16 terms, each divisible by 5. Let's compute their sum modulo 25. Let's denote each term as 5*a_i, so sum is 5*(a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_16). Let S = a_1 + ... + a_16. Then sum ≡ 5*S mod 25. If S ≡ 0 mod 5, then 5*S ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\n3. Terms divisible by 25: 4 terms, each not divisible by 5. Let's denote their sum as T mod 25.\n\nTherefore, N ≡ 0 + 5*S + T mod 25.\n\nTo have N ≡ 0 mod 25, we need 5*S + T ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nNow, let's analyze S and T.\n\nFirst, compute S = sum of a_i mod 5, where a_i = LCM/(5k_i) for k_i not divisible by 5. Since LCM/(5k_i) is LCM/(5) divided by k_i. LCM/5 is divisible by 5, but k_i is not, so LCM/(5k_i) is divisible by 5^{1}? Wait, LCM includes 5^2, so LCM/(5k_i) includes 5^{2-1} = 5^1. Therefore, LCM/(5k_i) is divisible by 5. Thus, a_i = LCM/(5k_i) is divisible by 5. Therefore, each a_i = 5*b_i, so S = 5*(b_1 + ... + b_16). Hence, 5*S = 5*(5*(sum b_i)) = 25*(sum b_i) ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nWait, this changes things. If each a_i is divisible by 5, then S = sum a_i is divisible by 5, so 5*S is divisible by 25. Therefore, the sum of the second group ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nNow, the terms divisible by 25 contribute T mod 25. Therefore, N ≡ T mod 25. Thus, to have N ≡ 0 mod 25, we need T ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nBut T is the sum of four terms, each LCM/k where k=25,50,75,100. Let's compute each term modulo 25.\n\nFirst, compute LCM/k for k=25:\n\nLCM/25 = LCM(1-100)/25. LCM(1-100) includes 5^2, so LCM/25 has no factors of 5. Therefore, LCM/25 is an integer not divisible by 5. Similarly, LCM/50 = LCM/(25*2) = (LCM/25)/2. LCM/25 is divisible by 2^6, so dividing by 2 gives 2^5, etc., so LCM/50 is an integer not divisible by 5. Similarly for LCM/75 = LCM/(25*3) = (LCM/25)/3, which is divisible by 3^4-1=3^3, etc., so not divisible by 5. And LCM/100 = LCM/(25*4) = (LCM/25)/4, which is divisible by 2^6-2=2^4, etc., not divisible by 5.\n\nTherefore, each term LCM/k for k=25,50,75,100 is an integer not divisible by 5. Let's denote them as T1, T2, T3, T4. We need T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nBut how can we compute these values modulo 25? Let's find each T_i mod 25.\n\nFirst, LCM(1-100) is a massive number, but we can find LCM(1-100)/25 mod 25. However, since LCM/25 is divisible by many primes, but modulo 25, we can reduce it modulo 25. Note that LCM/25 includes factors like 2^6, 3^4, 7^2, etc. Let's compute each T_i mod 25.\n\nFirst, T1 = LCM/25 mod 25.\n\nLCM/25 is divisible by 2^6, 3^4, 7^2, etc. Compute 2^6 mod 25: 64 mod 25 = 14. 3^4 mod 25: 81 mod 25 = 6. 7^2 mod 25: 49 mod 25 = 24. Similarly, other primes: 11,13, etc., raised to their respective powers mod 25. However, since LCM/25 includes all primes except 5 up to 100, their product mod 25 is needed. But this is complex. Alternatively, note that LCM/25 is congruent to 0 mod 4 (since 2^6 is divisible by 4), mod 3 (3^4 is 1 mod 4), etc., but modulo 25 is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, since LCM/25 is divisible by 2^6 and 3^4, which are 64 and 81 mod 25, which are 14 and 6 respectively. So LCM/25 ≡ 14 * 6 * ... (other primes) mod 25. But without knowing all factors, it's hard to compute exactly. However, notice that LCM/25 is divisible by 2^6, 3^4, and many other primes. However, modulo 25, the product of numbers coprime to 5 can be any value. But we need the sum T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 mod 25, where T1 = LCM/25, T2 = LCM/50, T3 = LCM/75, T4 = LCM/100.\n\nBut LCM/50 = LCM/(25*2) = (LCM/25)/2. Similarly, LCM/75 = (LCM/25)/3, and LCM/100 = (LCM/25)/4.\n\nLet’s denote M = LCM/25. Then T1 = M, T2 = M/2, T3 = M/3, T4 = M/4.\n\nTherefore, sum T = M + M/2 + M/3 + M/4 = M*(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4).\n\nBut M is divisible by 2^6, 3^4, etc., so M/2, M/3, M/4 are integers. Therefore, sum T = M*(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4).\n\nNotice that 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = (12 + 6 + 4 + 3)/12 = 25/12. Therefore, sum T = M*(25/12). But M is divisible by 12 (since LCM/25 is divisible by 3^4 and 2^6, so 12 divides M). Therefore, 25/12 * M = 25*(M/12). Hence, sum T is divisible by 25. Therefore, T ≡ 0 mod 25.\n\nTherefore, N ≡ T mod 25 ≡ 0 mod 25. Hence, N is divisible by 25.\n\nMoreover, since T = 25*(M/12), which is divisible by 25 but not necessarily by 125. Therefore, N is divisible by 25 but not necessarily by 125. Hence, v_5(N) = 2 (since LCM has 5^2 and N is divisible by 25 but not 125).\n\nThus, gcd(N, LCM) has v_5 = min(v_5(N), v_5(LCM)) = min(2, 2) = 2. Therefore, when reducing the fraction, B = LCM / gcd(N, LCM) has v_5 = 2 - 2 = 0, so B is not divisible by 5. Similarly, A = N / gcd(N, LCM) has v_5 = 2 - 2 = 0, so A is not divisible by 5. Therefore, neither A nor B is divisible by 5, which is what we needed to prove.",
