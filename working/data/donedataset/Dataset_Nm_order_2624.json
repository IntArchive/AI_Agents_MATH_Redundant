    "Content": "\"If $\\lambda, m,$ and $n$ are positive rational numbers, and $m > n$, then $\\lambda(m^2 − n^2), 2\\lambda mn$, and $\\lambda(m^2 + n^2)$ are positive rational numbers. Hence show how to determine any number of right-angled triangles the lengths of all of whose sides are rational.\" What does he mean by \"how to determine any number of right angled triangles\"?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We know that $3$ lengths can form a right angled triangle iff those lengths satisfy $a^2+b^2=c^2$. But no matter what we choose for $m, \\; n$ and $ \\lambda$. \n$$(2\\lambda mn)^2+(\\lambda(m^2-n^2))^2=4\\lambda^2m^2n^2+\\lambda^2m^4-2 \\lambda^2m^2n^2+\\lambda^2n^4$$\n$$=\\lambda^2m^4+2\\lambda^2m^2n^2+\\lambda^2n^4=(\\lambda(m^2+n^2))^2$$ as we wanted. So we can choose any number of rationals $m, \\; n$ and $\\lambda$ to produce any number of right-angled triangles. A simple example of an infinite solution set is if you keep $m$ and $n$ constant, but vary $\\lambda$, you will get infinite solutions as there are an infinite amount of rational numbers.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about Example I.I.2 from Hardy's book. The user is confused about what Hardy means by determining any number of right-angled triangles with rational sides.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem statement mentions that λ, m, and n are positive rational numbers, and m > n. Then it gives three expressions: λ(m² − n²), 2λmn, and λ(m² + n²). These are supposed to be positive rational numbers. The task is to show how to determine any number of such right-angled triangles.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be each condition given. Let's list them one by one. \n\n1. λ is a positive rational number.\n2. m is a positive rational number.\n3. n is a positive rational number.\n4. m is greater than n.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to different objects (λ, m, n). Then the problem is to show how to determine any number of right-angled triangles with all sides rational. The key is that the three expressions given are the sides of the triangle, which need to be rational. Since they are derived from λ, m, n, which are all positive rationals with m > n, the example provides a method to generate such triangles. The user's confusion is about what exactly is being asked here—probably wanting to clarify the steps to generate these triangles.\n\nSo, in the required format, the assumptions would be each of those conditions, and the problem is to explain how to determine an arbitrary number of right-angled triangles with rational sides using those expressions. The original problem's answer would involve demonstrating that these expressions satisfy the Pythagorean theorem and that by choosing different λ, m, n, you can generate infinitely many such triangles.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line, addressing one property of one object. So the four assumptions are clear. Then the problem statement is about determining the triangles, which Hardy's example is illustrating.",
