    "Content": "A colleague popped into my office this afternoon\nand asked me the following question. He told me there is a \nclever proof when $n=2$. I couldn't do\nanything with it, so I thought I'd post it here and see what happens. Prove or find a counterexample For positive, i.i.d. random variables $Z_1,\\dots, Z_n$\n with finite mean, and positive constants $a_1,\\dots, a_n$,\nwe have\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left({\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 Z_i\\over\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i Z_i}\\right)\n\\leq {\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2\\over\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i}.$$ Added: This problem originates from the thesis of a student in Computer and Electrical Engineering at the University of Alberta. Here is the response from his supervisor: \"Many thanks for this!  It is a nice result in addition to being useful in a practical problem of antenna placement.\"",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, the inequality always holds for i.i.d. random variables $Z_1,\\ldots,Z_n$. In fact, as suggested by Yuval and joriki, it is enough to suppose that the joint distribution is invariant under permuting the $Z_i$. Rearranging the inequality slightly, we just need to show that the following is nonnegative (here, I am using $\\bar a\\equiv\\sum_ia_i^2/\\sum_ia_i$)\n$$\n\\bar a-\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\sum_ia_i^2Z_i}{\\sum_ia_iZ_i}\\right]=\\sum_ia_i(\\bar a-a_i)\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{Z_i}{\\sum_ja_jZ_j}\\right].\n$$\nI'll write $c_i\\equiv\\mathbb{E}[Z_i/\\sum_ja_jZ_j]$ for brevity. Then, noting that $\\sum_ia_i(\\bar a-a_i)=0$, choosing any constant $\\bar c$ that we like,\n$$\n\\bar a-\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\sum_ia_i^2Z_i}{\\sum_ia_iZ_i}\\right]=\\sum_ia_i(\\bar a-a_i)(c_i-\\bar c).\n$$\nTo show that this is nonnegative, it is enough to show that $c_i$ is a decreasing function of $a_i$ (that is, $c_i\\le c_j$ whenever $a_i\\ge a_j$). In that case, we can choose $\\bar c$ so that $\\bar c\\ge c_i$ whenever $a_i\\ge\\bar a$ and $\\bar c\\le c_i$ whenever $a_i\\le\\bar a$. This makes each term in the final summation above positive and completes the proof. Choosing $i\\not=j$ such that $a_i \\ge a_j$,\n$$\nc_i-c_j=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{Z_i-Z_j}{\\sum_ka_kZ_k}\\right]\n$$\nLet $\\pi$ be the permutation of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ which exchanges $i,j$ and leaves everything else fixed. Using invariance under permuting $Z_i,Z_j$,\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n2(c_i-c_j)&=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{Z_i-Z_j}{\\sum_ka_kZ_k}\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{Z_i-Z_j}{\\sum_ka_kZ_{\\pi(k)}}\\right]\\cr\n&=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{(a_j-a_i)(Z_i-Z_j)^2}{\\sum_ka_kZ_k\\sum_ka_kZ_{\\pi(k)}}\\right]\\cr\n&\\le0.\n\\end{align}\n$$\nSo $c_i$ is decreasing in $a_i$ as claimed. Note: In the special case of $n=2$, we can always make the choice $\\bar c=(c_1+c_2)/2$. Then, both terms of the summation on the right hand side of the second displayed equation above are the same, giving\n$$\n\\bar a-\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\sum_ia_i^2Z_i}{\\sum_ia_iZ_i}\\right]=\\frac{a_1a_2(a_2-a_1)(c_1-c_2)}{a_1+a_2}.\n$$\nPlugging in my expression above for $2(c_1-c_2)$ gives the identity\n$$\n\\bar a-\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\sum_ia_i^2Z_i}{\\sum_ia_iZ_i}\\right]=\\frac{a_1a_2(a_1-a_2)^2}{2(a_1+a_2)}\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{(Z_1-Z_2)^2}{(a_1Z_1+a_2Z_2)(a_1Z_2+a_2Z_1)}\\right],\n$$\nwhich is manifestly nonnegative. I'm guessing this could be the \"clever\" proof mentioned in the question. Note 2: The proof above relies on $\\mathbb{E}[Z_i/\\sum_ja_jZ_j]$ being a decreasing function of $a_i$. More generally, for any decreasing $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}^+\\to\\mathbb{R}^+$, then $\\mathbb{E}[Z_if(\\sum_ja_jZ_j)]$ is a decreasing function of $a_i$. Choosing positive $b_i$ and setting $\\bar a=\\sum_ia_ib_i/\\sum_ib_i$ then $\\sum_ib_i(\\bar a-a_i)=0$. Applying the argument above gives the inequality\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[f\\left(\\sum_ia_iZ_i\\right)\\sum_ia_ib_iZ_i\\right]\n\\le\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[f\\left(\\sum_ia_iZ_i\\right)\\sum_ib_iZ_i\\right]\\frac{\\sum_ia_ib_i}{\\sum_ib_i}\n$$\nThe inequality in the question is the special case with $b_i=a_i$ and $f(x)=1/x$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original problem carefully and extract the key assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving an inequality involving expected values. The user mentions that the colleague asked about a proof for n=2 and that the random variables are positive, i.i.d., have finite mean, and the constants a_i are positive. \n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The random variables Z_1, ..., Z_n are positive. Each Z_i is positive.\n2. They are i.i.d. (independently and identically distributed). This is a key condition because i.i.d. variables have the same distribution and are independent, which might allow simplifications in the expectation.\n3. The random variables have finite mean. This is important because the expectation might not exist otherwise.\n4. The constants a_1, ..., a_n are positive. Each a_i is a positive constant.\n\nThese are all separate assumptions applying to different objects: the Z_i's and the a_i's. Each should be on its own line.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove or find a counterexample for the inequality given. The user also added some context about the origin, but that's not part of the problem itself.\n\nNow, checking the example provided in the query. The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo following that structure, here the assumptions would be the four points above, each as a separate line. The problem is the inequality involving the expected value.\n\nI need to make sure not to include extraneous information like the colleague's comment or the origin from the thesis. Only the mathematical assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"positive constants a_i\". So each a_i is positive, that's another assumption. So each of these should be listed separately.\n\nLet me verify again:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Z_1, ..., Z_n are positive random variables.\n- Z_1, ..., Z_n are i.i.d.\n- Z_1, ..., Z_n have finite mean.\n- a_1, ..., a_n are positive constants.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to one object (the Z_i's or the a_i's). So four assumptions.\n\nThe problem is to prove or find a counterexample for the given inequality involving the expected value.\n\nYes, that seems right. The added context about the origin isn't part of the problem, so it's filtered out as per the user's instruction to remove unrelated information.\n\nSo structuring it accordingly.",
