    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, focusing on one object each. The problem is then stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question here: the task is to prove that the integral from 0 to 1 of (ln x)/(x-1) dx equals the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n². The original problem mentions trying Fourier series or power series but didn't work out.\n\nNow, the assumptions. The integral is from 0 to 1. The integrand is (ln x)/(x-1). The user is asking for a proof, so the problem statement is about showing equality between the integral and the series. Are there any implicit assumptions here? The function (ln x)/(x-1) might have a singularity at x=1, but since the integral is from 0 to 1, maybe we need to consider convergence. However, the example given in the problem didn't list convergence as an assumption, perhaps assuming it's given. Since the example only listed the variable's condition (n is integer, divisible by 7), here maybe the assumptions are about the integral's limits and the integrand's form. But the original problem doesn't specify any particular conditions beyond the integral itself. Wait, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user didn't state that. Maybe the example was a different problem. \n\nWait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't explicitly in the original problem. Wait, actually, looking back: the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's inconsistent. Maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user intended to have a different problem where n needs to be divisible by 7? Maybe a typo. Anyway, perhaps in the current problem, there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's bounds and the integrand. The problem is to prove the equality, so maybe the assumptions are just the integral setup. But the example's format requires listing each assumption line by line. So in this case, the integral is from 0 to 1, the integrand is (ln x)/(x-1), and the equality to the series sum. However, since the example listed the variable's conditions, perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\n1. The integral is taken over the interval [0,1].\n2. The integrand is (ln x)/(x - 1).\n\nBut maybe also considering that the integral is an improper integral because at x=1, the denominator becomes zero, but ln(1) is zero, so it's a 0/0 indeterminate form. So perhaps there's an assumption that the integral converges. However, in the example, they didn't list convergence assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is stated as is, so the only explicit assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand. The problem is to prove the equality. Therefore, structuring the problem accordingly.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is (ln x)/(x - 1).\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln x }{x-1} d x=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the original example, they included two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was to prove for every integer n, which contradicts the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the example was incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps only the integral's setup is needed as assumptions, and the problem is the equality. So I think that's how to structure it.",
