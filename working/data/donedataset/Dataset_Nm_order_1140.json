    "Content": "Let $(\\Omega,\\Sigma,P)$ be a probability space and $X: [0,\\infty) \\times \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Gaussian process (i.e. all finite linear combinations $\\sum_i a_i X_{t_i}$ are Gaussian random variables). If the\nprocess is continuous, it seems to be clear that the process $Y_t (\\omega) = \\int_0^t X_s(\\omega) ds$ is a Gaussian process. Is it true that $Y_t$ is a Gaussian process even if $X$ is only assumed to be measurable?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Question 1: Is $Y_t(\\omega)$ well-defined? Answer: No, in general, $Y_t(\\omega)$ is not well-defined; we need some additional assumption on the integrability of $X$ to ensure that $$\\int_0^t |X_s(\\omega)| \\, ds <\\infty$$ for $t>0$ . This is e.g. satisfied if $X$ has continuous sample paths or $\\sup_{t \\leq T} \\mathbb{E}(|X_t|)<\\infty$ for any $T>0$ . (To see that it $Y_t$ is in general not well-defined, just consider $X_t := t^{-1} Z$ , $t>0$ , for $Z \\sim N(0,1)$ ; then $X$ is Gaussian, but the integral $\\int_0^t X_t \\, ds$ does not exist.) Question 2: Is $\\omega \\mapsto Y_t(\\omega)$ a random variable for fixed $t \\geq 0$ ? Answer: If the process $X: (0,\\infty) \\times \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is jointly measurable, then $Y_t$ is a random variable for each $t \\geq 0$ . Otherwise, measurability of $Y_t$ might fail. Question 3: Is $(Y_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ Gaussian? Answer: If $t \\mapsto X_t(\\omega)$ is Riemann integrable, this follows by approximation the integral by Riemann sums; see e.g. this question . (Note that a bounded function $f:[0,T] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is Riemann integrable if, and only if, the points in $[0,T]$ where $f$ is discontinuous is a Lebesgue null set.) Edit: Okay, so somewhat more detailed: For any (Riemann) integrable function $f:[0,t] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ it is known that the (Riemann) integral $$\\int_0^t f(s) \\, ds$$ can be approximated by Riemann sums $$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} f(s_j) (t_{j+1}-t_j)$$ where $0=t_0 < \\ldots <t_n = t$ is a partition of the interval $[0,t]$ and $s_j \\in [t_j,t_{j+1}]$ . In particular, if we choose $s_j = t_j := t \\frac{j}{n}$ , we find $$\\int_0^t f(s) \\, ds = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{t}{n} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} f \\left( t \\frac{j}{n} \\right).$$ Applying this in order (stochastic) setting, we get $$\\int_0^t X_s \\, ds = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{t}{n} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} X_{t j/n};$$ and $\\frac{t}{n} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} X_{t j/n}$ is Gaussian because $X$ is Gaussian.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about the integral of a Gaussian process. They define a probability space and a Gaussian process X. The key points here are that X is a Gaussian process, meaning all finite linear combinations are Gaussian random variables. Then, they mention that if the process is continuous, Y_t defined as the integral from 0 to t of X_s ds is Gaussian. The question is whether Y_t remains Gaussian even if X is only assumed to be measurable, not necessarily continuous.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The probability space is given as (Ω, Σ, P). So that's an assumption about the space.\n2. X is a Gaussian process. That's a key condition on X.\n3. The process X is defined from [0, ∞) × Ω to ℝ. So the domain of X is specified.\n4. The question considers two scenarios: one where X is continuous, leading to Y_t being Gaussian, and the other where X is only measurable. The main question is about the measurable case. However, the original problem is asking whether Y_t is Gaussian when X is measurable, so the assumptions should include that X is measurable, not necessarily continuous. But wait, in the original problem statement, the user mentions that if X is continuous, then Y is Gaussian. The question is whether this holds when X is only measurable. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem in question would include that X is measurable, but not necessarily continuous.\n\nWait, the user is asking: Is Y_t Gaussian even if X is only assumed to be measurable? So the problem's assumptions are that X is a measurable Gaussian process. So the continuity is not assumed here. The previous statement about continuity being clear is just context.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n- (Ω, Σ, P) is a probability space.\n- X: [0, ∞) × Ω → ℝ is a Gaussian process.\n- X is measurable.\n- Y_t(ω) = ∫₀^t X_s(ω) ds.\n\nThe problem is to determine if Y_t is a Gaussian process under these assumptions.\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that X is measurable in the question part; the user is asking if it's true when X is only assumed to be measurable. So in the problem as presented, the key point is that the user is assuming X is measurable (instead of continuous) and asking if Y is Gaussian. So the assumptions should include that X is measurable.\n\nBut let me check the original problem again:\n\nThe user writes: \"Is it true that Y_t is a Gaussian process even if X is only assumed to be measurable?\" So in this scenario, the conditions are:\n\n- X is a Gaussian process.\n- X is measurable (as opposed to continuous, which was the previous case where it's known to hold).\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. (Ω, Σ, P) is a probability space.\n2. X: [0, ∞) × Ω → ℝ is a Gaussian process.\n3. X is measurable.\n4. Y is defined as the integral of X from 0 to t.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line addressing one property. Let's parse each part.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The space is a probability space (Ω, Σ, P).\n- X is a Gaussian process (all finite linear combinations are Gaussian).\n- The process X is measurable.\n- Y_t(ω) is defined as the integral ∫₀^t X_s(ω) ds.\n\nBut wait, the problem is whether Y_t is a Gaussian process under these conditions. The user mentions that when X is continuous, Y is Gaussian. The question is about dropping continuity and only assuming measurability.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here are that X is a measurable Gaussian process, and Y is the integral of X. So the problem is to prove or determine if Y is Gaussian under these conditions.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- (Ω, Σ, P) is a probability space.\n- X: [0, ∞) × Ω → ℝ is a Gaussian process.\n- X is measurable.\n- Y_t(ω) = ∫₀^t X_s(ω) ds for each t ≥ 0.\n\nProblem: Is Y_t a Gaussian process?\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Is it true that Y_t is a Gaussian process even if X is only assumed to be measurable?\" So the problem is to determine the truth of that statement.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the problem was \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem is phrased as a question, but perhaps the user wants it restated as a problem to prove or disprove.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- (Ω, Σ, P) is a probability space.\n- X: [0, ∞) × Ω → ℝ is a Gaussian process.\n- X is measurable.\n- Y_t(ω) is defined as ∫₀^t X_s(ω) ds for each t ≥ 0 and ω ∈ Ω.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that Y_t is a Gaussian process.\n\nBut maybe in the problem statement, it's phrased as \"Is it true...\" but according to the example, the problem is stated as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the user wants to rephrase the question as a problem statement. However, the original question is a yes/no question. Since the example's problem was \"Prove that...\", maybe the assistant should rephrase the question as \"Prove or disprove that...\", but the original user is asking for confirmation.\n\nAlternatively, follow the structure of the example. The example's original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) but in the user's answer, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts the problem. However, looking at the example, perhaps the user made a mistake here. But since the user provided that example as their own, maybe they intended to filter out the assumption that n is an integer and added another assumption. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\", but then also \"n is divisible by 7\". But that would change the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to remove the divisibility by 7? Because in the original problem, there's no mention of divisibility by 7. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" 91 is 7×13. So perhaps the formatted problem's assumptions include that n is divisible by 7 and 13, but no. Wait, the example given by the user has:\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that [...] is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would mean proving it's divisible by 91 under the condition that n is divisible by 7. But this is conflicting with the original problem. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect. However, as an assistant, I should follow the user's example structure, even if there's a mistake. But in the current problem, the Math Stack Exchange question is correctly to be formatted.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the user wants to extract all the conditions from the problem. Let me go back to the current problem.\n\nOriginal question:\n\nTitle: Integral of a Gaussian process\n\nQuestion: Let (Ω,Σ,P) be a probability space and X: [0,∞) × Ω → ℝ be a Gaussian process (i.e., all finite linear combinations ∑ᵢ a_i X_{t_i} are Gaussian random variables). If the process is continuous, it seems to be clear that the process Y_t(ω) = ∫₀^t X_s(ω) ds is a Gaussian process. Is it true that Y_t is a Gaussian process even if X is only assumed to be measurable? I am working through the derivation of Kalman Filter in the text by Bernt Oksendal Eq 6.2.10 (fifth edition) and this seems to be a way to show that M_t (in the book) is a Gaussian process.\n\nSo, to structure the problem as per the example:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. (Ω, Σ, P) is a probability space.\n2. X: [0, ∞) × Ω → ℝ is a Gaussian process.\n3. X is measurable.\n4. Y_t(ω) = ∫₀^t X_s(ω) ds for each t ≥ 0 and ω ∈ Ω.\n\nProblem: Is Y_t a Gaussian process?\n\nBut the example had \"Prove that ...\", but here it's a yes/no question. However, the user's example transformed the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" with assumptions. So perhaps the problem statement here should be \"Prove or disprove that Y_t is a Gaussian process when X is measurable.\"\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to determine whether Y_t is Gaussian under the given assumptions. However, the user's example restated the problem with the assumptions, even if they added an extra one. But in this case, the original problem's key conditions are that X is measurable (not necessarily continuous) and a Gaussian process. The continuity was a prior condition where it's known, but now they're removing continuity and adding measurability.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that X is measurable. But in the original problem statement, the user says \"if the process is continuous, it seems to be clear [...] Is it true that Y_t is a Gaussian process even if X is only assumed to be measurable?\"\n\nSo the key assumptions for the problem in question are:\n\n- X is a Gaussian process.\n- X is measurable.\n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n(Ω, Σ, P) is a probability space,\nX: [0, ∞) × Ω → ℝ is a Gaussian process,\nX is measurable,\nY_t(ω) = ∫₀^t X_s(ω) ds.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that Y_t is a Gaussian process.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is phrased as \"Is it true that...\", the problem can be restated as \"Determine whether Y_t is a Gaussian process.\"\n\nBut following the example, which converted the original problem's \"Prove that for every integer n...\" into \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91\" with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7 (which might be a mistake), perhaps the current problem should have the assumptions listed as per the problem's conditions, not including the continuity but including measurability.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n(Ω, Σ, P) is a probability space,\nX: [0, ∞) × Ω → ℝ is a Gaussian process,\nX is measurable,\nY_t(ω) = ∫₀^t X_s(ω) ds.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that Y_t is a Gaussian process.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking if it's true, the problem could be \"Prove that Y_t is a Gaussian process.\" But since it's a question, maybe \"Determine whether Y_t is a Gaussian process...\" However, the example used \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the correct way is to rephrase the question as a statement to prove, but given that the answer might be \"Yes, it's true\", but the format is to present the problem as a directive.\n\nAlternatively, if the example included an incorrect assumption, but following it regardless.\n\nSo, after considering all this, the final answer should list the assumptions as the probability space, X being a Gaussian process, X being measurable, and Y defined as the integral. The problem is to prove whether Y is Gaussian.",
