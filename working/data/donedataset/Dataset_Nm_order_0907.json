    "AcceptedAnswer": "As it happens I have my copy of Baumslag & Chandler on the shelf. This exercise is listed as very hard . I seem to have pencilled in a solution 27-28 years ago. The text is really worn out, so I can only make out the first few steps. Damn, I really need a prescription for new glasses... Anyway here are the first three consequences of those relations:\n$$\na^{-1}b^8a=b^{12}, a^{-1}b^{12}a=b^{18}, a^{-1}b^{18}a=b^{27}.\n$$\nAs consequences of these I seem to have derived (you must rederive these for full credit) the following:\n$$\na^{-2}b^{12}a^2=b^{27}=a^{-3}b^8a^3=b^{-1}a^{-2}b^8a^2b.\n$$\nThe next consequence seems to be $a^{-2}b^8a^2=a^{-2}b^{12}a^2.$ From that point on the text is too blurred, but I think I might be able to redo that even though my brain has lost most of its agility over the years. Just in case this is homework I will stop here with these hints.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a group G with elements a and b. The given equations are a inverse times b squared times a equals b cubed, and b inverse times a squared times b equals a cubed. We need to prove that both a and b are the identity element e.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some group theory basics. In a group, conjugation is when you take an element x and compute g inverse times x times g. This often relates to commutators or certain relations between elements. The given equations are conjugation relations: a conjugating b² gives b³, and b conjugating a² gives a³.\n\nLet me write down the given equations more clearly:\n\n1. a⁻¹b²a = b³\n2. b⁻¹a²b = a³\n\nWe need to show a = e and b = e.\n\nLet me start by manipulating the first equation. If I conjugate b² by a and get b³, maybe I can find a relation between powers of b. Similarly, the second equation conjugates a² by b to get a³.\n\nPerhaps I can express these as exponents. Let's see. If I apply the first equation repeatedly, maybe I can find a pattern or reduce the exponents somehow.\n\nStarting with equation 1: a⁻¹b²a = b³. Let's see what happens if I conjugate both sides by a again. Taking a⁻¹ of both sides on the left and a on the right:\n\na⁻¹(a⁻¹b²a)a = a⁻¹b³a\n\nSimplify left side: (a⁻²)b²(a²) = a⁻¹b³a\n\nBut wait, the right side is a⁻¹b³a. Not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express b² in terms of a and b³. From equation 1, multiplying both sides on the left by a and on the right by a⁻¹:\n\nb² = a b³ a⁻¹\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2: b⁻¹a²b = a³. Multiply both sides on the left by b and on the right by b⁻¹:\n\na² = b a³ b⁻¹\n\nSo now we have:\n\nb² = a b³ a⁻¹ (1a)\n\na² = b a³ b⁻¹ (2a)\n\nMaybe substitute one into the other. Let's see.\n\nFrom (1a): b² = a b³ a⁻¹. Let's cube both sides. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe express higher powers of b in terms of a.\n\nAlternatively, use (1a) to express b³ as a⁻¹ b² a. Wait, no, original equation was a⁻¹b²a = b³, so b³ = a⁻¹b²a.\n\nSimilarly, from (2a), a³ = b⁻¹ a² b.\n\nWait, let me try to iterate these relations. Suppose we start with b³ = a⁻¹b²a. Let's compute b⁹ by applying this relation multiple times.\n\nb³ = a⁻¹b²a\n\nThen b⁹ = (b³)^3 = (a⁻¹b²a)^3 = a⁻¹b²a a⁻¹b²a a⁻¹b²a = a⁻¹b² (a a⁻¹) b² (a a⁻¹) b² a = a⁻¹b² e b² e b² a = a⁻¹b⁶a\n\nBut b⁹ = a⁻¹b⁶a. But we can also write b⁶ as (b³)^2 = (a⁻¹b²a)^2 = a⁻¹b²a a⁻¹b²a = a⁻¹b² (a a⁻¹) b²a = a⁻¹b² e b²a = a⁻¹b⁴a. So b⁶ = a⁻¹b⁴a. Then substituting back into b⁹:\n\nb⁹ = a⁻¹ (a⁻¹b⁴a) a = a⁻²b⁴a²\n\nSimilarly, continuing this pattern, maybe we can express higher powers in terms of a⁻ⁿ b^{...} aⁿ.\n\nBut this might not be the right approach. Alternatively, let's try to manipulate the equations to find relations between a and b.\n\nFrom equation (1a): b² = a b³ a⁻¹\n\nFrom equation (2a): a² = b a³ b⁻¹\n\nLet me substitute a² from (2a) into itself. Let's see:\n\na² = b a³ b⁻¹\n\nBut a³ can be expressed using (2a) again. Wait, (2a) is a² = b a³ b⁻¹. If we solve for a³: a³ = b⁻¹ a² b\n\nSo substitute that into a³ in the equation for a²:\n\na² = b (b⁻¹ a² b) b⁻¹ = (b b⁻¹) a² (b b⁻¹) = e a² e = a²\n\nHmm, that just gives a trivial identity. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to use both equations together. Let's take the expression for a² from (2a) and substitute into the expression for b² from (1a).\n\nFrom (1a): b² = a b³ a⁻¹\n\nBut b³ can be expressed using equation 1: b³ = a⁻¹ b² a\n\nSo substituting into (1a):\n\nb² = a (a⁻¹ b² a) a⁻¹ = (a a⁻¹) b² (a a⁻¹) = e b² e = b²\n\nAgain, circular. Hmm.\n\nMaybe try to find commutators. Let's compute the commutator [a, b] = a⁻¹b⁻¹ab.\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, let's take equation (1a): b² = a b³ a⁻¹. Let's rearrange this as b² a = a b³. Similarly, from equation (2a): a² = b a³ b⁻¹ => a² b = b a³.\n\nSo we have:\n\nb² a = a b³ (from 1a)\na² b = b a³ (from 2a)\n\nNow, perhaps we can use these to express higher products. Let's try to compute something like b² a².\n\nUsing the first equation, b² a = a b³, so b² a² = (b² a) a = a b³ a\n\nSimilarly, using the second equation, a² b = b a³, so a² b³ = (a² b) b² = b a³ b²\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, let's consider the equations:\n\nFrom b² a = a b³, we can write this as (b² a) = a b³. Let's conjugate both sides by b. That is, take b⁻¹ (b² a) b = b⁻¹ (a b³) b.\n\nLeft side: b⁻¹ b² a b = b a b\n\nRight side: b⁻¹ a b³ b = b⁻¹ a b⁴\n\nSo we have b a b = b⁻¹ a b⁴\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by b:\n\nb² a b = a b⁴\n\nBut from the first equation, we know that b² a = a b³. Let's substitute that into the left side:\n\n(a b³) b = a b⁴\n\nWhich simplifies to a b⁴ = a b⁴, which is trivial. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the two equations together. Let's take the first equation: b² a = a b³\n\nAnd the second equation: a² b = b a³\n\nLet me try to compute a² b². From the second equation, a² b = b a³, so a² b² = (a² b) b = b a³ b\n\nNow, using the first equation, b² a = a b³, so b a³ b = b a² (a b) = b a² (from b² a = a b³? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to manipulate both equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: b² = a b³ a⁻¹\n\nFrom equation 2: a² = b a³ b⁻¹\n\nLet me substitute a from equation 2 into equation 1. Wait, but equation 2 is about a². Maybe express a in terms of b and then substitute.\n\nAlternatively, let's raise equation 1 to some power. For instance, if we take equation 1: a⁻¹b²a = b³. Let's conjugate b² by a to get b³. Then conjugating again by a: (a⁻¹)^2 b² a² = a⁻¹ b³ a. But a⁻¹ b³ a = (a⁻¹ b a)^3. Wait, but from the original equation, a⁻¹ b² a = b³. So maybe there's a pattern when conjugating multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the commutator of a and b. Let me define [a, b] = a⁻¹b⁻¹ab. If we can show that [a, b] = e, then a and b commute, which might help. But not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find the order of a and b. Suppose the group has elements of finite order. If we can show that the order of a and b is 1, then they are identity.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that G is finite. However, the conclusion is a = e = b, so maybe regardless of G, the only solution is trivial.\n\nAlternatively, use the two given equations to derive relations that force a and b to be e.\n\nLet me try to compute a in terms of b. From equation 2: a² = b a³ b⁻¹. Let's rearrange this: a² = b a³ b⁻¹ => a² b = b a³. Then, multiplying both sides on the left by a⁻²: b = a⁻² b a³. Then, multiply both sides on the right by a⁻³: b a⁻³ = a⁻² b. So, a² b a⁻³ = b.\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, from equation 1: a⁻¹b²a = b³ => b² = a b³ a⁻¹. Let's substitute this into itself recursively.\n\nCompute b² = a b³ a⁻¹. Then, substitute b³ from the original equation: b³ = a⁻¹ b² a. So, substituting into b²:\n\nb² = a (a⁻¹ b² a) a⁻¹ = (a a⁻¹) b² (a a⁻¹) = b². Again, circular.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use both equations together. Let's take equation 1: a⁻¹b²a = b³ and equation 2: b⁻¹a²b = a³.\n\nLet me try to substitute one into the other. For example, express a² from equation 2 in terms of a³ and substitute into equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 2: a² = b a³ b⁻¹. Let's cube both sides: (a²)^3 = (b a³ b⁻¹)^3 => a^6 = b a³ b⁻¹ b a³ b⁻¹ b a³ b⁻¹ = b a³ (b⁻¹ b) a³ (b⁻¹ b) a³ b⁻¹ = b a³ e a³ e a³ b⁻¹ = b a^9 b⁻¹.\n\nSo, a^6 = b a^9 b⁻¹. Then, rearranged: a^6 = b a^9 b⁻¹ => b⁻¹ a^6 b = a^9.\n\nBut this might not help directly. Similarly, maybe manipulate equation 1 to higher powers.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider taking equation 1 and equation 2 and composing them in some way.\n\nLet me try to compute the commutator [a, b] = a⁻¹b⁻¹ab. Suppose we can express this commutator in terms of a and b.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: From equation 1: a⁻¹b²a = b³ => b² = a b³ a⁻¹. From equation 2: b⁻¹a²b = a³ => a² = b a³ b⁻¹.\n\nLet me compute a² in terms of b and a³, and then substitute a³ from equation 2 into itself.\n\nFrom equation 2: a³ = b⁻¹ a² b. So substituting into a² = b a³ b⁻¹ gives:\n\na² = b (b⁻¹ a² b) b⁻¹ = (b b⁻¹) a² (b b⁻¹) = e a² e = a². Again, circular.\n\nPerhaps try to compute higher powers. Let's compute a⁴ using equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 2: a² = b a³ b⁻¹. Then, a⁴ = (a²)^2 = (b a³ b⁻¹)^2 = b a³ b⁻¹ b a³ b⁻¹ = b a³ a³ b⁻¹ = b a^6 b⁻¹.\n\nBut also, a⁴ = a² * a² = (b a³ b⁻¹) * (b a³ b⁻¹) = b a³ (b⁻¹ b) a³ b⁻¹ = b a^6 b⁻¹, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, from equation 2, a³ = b⁻¹ a² b. Let's cube both sides: (a³)^3 = (b⁻¹ a² b)^3 => a^9 = b⁻¹ a² b b⁻¹ a² b b⁻¹ a² b = b⁻¹ a² (b b⁻¹) a² (b b⁻¹) a² b = b⁻¹ a^6 b.\n\nSo, a^9 = b⁻¹ a^6 b. But from earlier, a^6 = b a^9 b⁻¹. Substitute into this:\n\na^9 = b⁻¹ (b a^9 b⁻¹) b = (b⁻¹ b) a^9 (b⁻¹ b) = e a^9 e = a^9. Again, circular.\n\nThis seems going in circles. Maybe try another approach. Let's use the two equations to find a relation between a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: a⁻¹b²a = b³ => b² = a b³ a⁻¹.\n\nFrom equation 2: b⁻¹a²b = a³ => a² = b a³ b⁻¹.\n\nLet me substitute the expression for a² from equation 2 into equation 1's expression for b².\n\nFrom equation 2: a² = b a³ b⁻¹ => a³ = b⁻¹ a² b.\n\nSubstitute a³ into equation 1's b²:\n\nb² = a (a³) a⁻¹ = a (b⁻¹ a² b) a⁻¹ = a b⁻¹ a² b a⁻¹.\n\nBut from equation 2, a² = b a³ b⁻¹. Substitute that in:\n\nb² = a b⁻¹ (b a³ b⁻¹) b a⁻¹ = a b⁻¹ b a³ b⁻¹ b a⁻¹ = a e a³ e a⁻¹ = a a³ a⁻¹ = a^3 a⁻¹ = a².\n\nSo we get b² = a².\n\nSimilarly, using equation 1 and 2, we can derive that b² = a².\n\nNow, since b² = a², let's denote this common value as c = a² = b². Then, perhaps find relations involving c.\n\nBut let's see. If a² = b², then from equation 2: a² = b a³ b⁻¹. But a² = b², so:\n\nb² = b a³ b⁻¹ => multiply both sides by b⁻¹ on the left: b = a³ b⁻¹ => multiply both sides by b: b² = a³.\n\nBut we already have b² = a², so a² = a³ => a = e.\n\nSimilarly, since a = e, then from a² = b², we get e = b² => b² = e. Then from equation 1: a⁻¹ b² a = b³. But a = e, so b² = b³ => b = e.\n\nThus, a = e and b = e.\n\nWait, that seems to work! Let me recap.\n\nFrom substituting the expressions, we found that b² = a². Then, substituting into equation 2, we get b² = b a³ b⁻¹. Then, simplifying gives b = a³. But since b² = a², substitute a³ = b into a²:\n\nb² = a² => (a³)² = a² => a^6 = a² => a^4 = e.\n\nSo a has order dividing 4. But then, from equation 2: a² = b a³ b⁻¹. If a^4 = e, then a³ = a⁻¹. So, substituting:\n\na² = b a⁻¹ b⁻¹ => a² = b a⁻¹ b⁻¹.\n\nBut we also have from b = a³ (earlier conclusion?), but wait, earlier steps need to be checked.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nFrom equation 1 and 2, we derived that b² = a². Let me denote c = a² = b².\n\nFrom equation 2: a² = b a³ b⁻¹. But a² = c, so c = b a³ b⁻¹. Similarly, since c = b², we have b² = b a³ b⁻¹ => multiply both sides by b⁻¹: b = a³.\n\nSo b = a³. But since c = a² = b², substituting b = a³ gives a² = (a³)^2 = a^6 => a^6 = a² => a^4 = e. So a^4 = e.\n\nThen, a has order dividing 4. So a^4 = e. Then, a³ = a⁻¹.\n\nFrom b = a³, we get b = a⁻¹.\n\nNow, from equation 1: a⁻¹ b² a = b³. Substitute b = a⁻¹ and b² = a²:\n\na⁻¹ a² a = (a⁻¹)^3 => a⁻¹ a² a = a² = (a⁻¹)^3 = a^{-3} = a (since a^4 = e, a^{-3} = a^{1}).\n\nSo we have a² = a => a = e.\n\nThus, a = e, then b = a³ = e³ = e.\n\nTherefore, a = e and b = e.\n\nThis completes the proof.",
