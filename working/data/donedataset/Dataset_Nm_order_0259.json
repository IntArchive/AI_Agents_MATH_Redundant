    "Content": "Let $A_i$ be a subset of a metric space for each $i\\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $B_n := \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i$. Prove (for any) $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that $\\overline{B_n} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\overline{A_i}$. If $B = \\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i$, prove that $\\overline{B} \\supseteq \\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty \\overline{A_i}$. Give an example to show that this containment might be proper. If $A_i$ is closed then $A_i = \\bar A_i$, but I'm stuck as to how to prove $B=\\bar B_n$. If I prove the first statement for when $A_i$ is closed does that mean it is also true for when $A_i$ is open because I can construct a closed set containing $A_i$? For the example, would constructing a sequence of closed segments between $0$ and $1$ that gets arbitrarily close to $1$ and taking the union of the segments be considered a proper containment?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To prove the true statements we'll make use of the following facts: If $A \\subseteq B$, then $\\overline{A} \\subseteq \\overline{B}$. $x \\in \\overline{A}$ iff $U \\cap A \\neq \\varnothing$ for every open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$.  (This is in the more general context of general topological spaces. For metric spaces it suffices to restrict the $U$s to the open $\\varepsilon$-balls centred at $x$.) To see that $\\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\overline{A_i} \\subseteq \\overline{B_n}$ observe that $A_i \\subseteq B_n$ for each $i \\leq n$, and apply the first fact above. To see that $\\overline{B_n} \\subseteq \\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\overline{A}_i$ note that this is equivalent to showing $X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\overline{A}_i \\subseteq X \\setminus \\overline{B_n}$. If $x \\in X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\overline{A_i}$, then by the second fact above it follows that for each $i \\leq n$ there is an open neighbourhood $U_i$ of $x$ which is disjoint from $A_i$. Now note that $U := U_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap U_n$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ which is disjoint from $B_n$. Note that the first fact above also shows that $\\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty \\overline{A_i} \\subseteq \\overline{\\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i} = \\overline{B}$. To give an example of where the equality does not hold, just enumerate the set $\\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers as $\\{ a_i : i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$, and for each $i$ define $A_i = \\{ a_i \\}$. Working in $\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual (metric/order) topology, we can show that\n$$\n{\\textstyle \\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty} \\overline{A_i} = \\mathbb{Q} \\neq \\mathbb{R} = \n\\overline { {\\textstyle \\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty} A_i }.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question: The user is dealing with subsets A_i in a metric space. They mention B_n as the finite union from i=1 to n of A_i, and they need to prove that the closure of B_n equals the union of the closures of each A_i. Then, for the infinite union B, they need to show that the closure of B contains the union of all closures of A_i, and provide an example where this containment is proper.\n\nAssumptions to list: Each A_i is a subset of a metric space. The problem has two parts: one for finite n and another for infinite. For the first part, n is a natural number. For the second part, B is the infinite union. The example part requires showing a case where closure of B is strictly larger than the union of closures.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"for any n ∈ N\" in the first part. So the assumptions are that A_i are subsets of a metric space, B_n is their finite union up to n, and n is a natural number. Then for the second part, B is the infinite union. The example requires specific conditions where the containment is proper.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. Let me check the example given. The example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nSo here:\n\nAssumption lines:\n\n- Each A_i is a subset of a metric space (for all i in N)\n- B_n is the union of A_i from i=1 to n (for any n in N)\n- B is the union of A_i from i=1 to infinity\n\nThen the problem parts:\n\n1. Prove for any n in N that closure(B_n) = union of closures of A_i from 1 to n.\n2. Prove that closure(B) contains the union of closures of A_i from 1 to infinity.\n3. Give an example where this containment is proper.\n\nThe original question also mentions the user's thoughts about closed sets and constructing an example with closed segments approaching 1. But the formatted problem should not include the user's thoughts, only the problem statement.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\nEach A_i is a subset of a metric space (stated once, for all i).\n\nThen, for the first part: n is a natural number, B_n is the finite union up to n.\n\nSecond part: B is the infinite union.\n\nThird part: example where closure(B) strictly contains the union of closures.\n\nSo the assumptions would list the general conditions:\n\n- Let A_i be a subset of a metric space for each i ∈ N.\n- For each n ∈ N, B_n = ∪_{i=1}^n A_i.\n- B = ∪_{i=1}^∞ A_i.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line, one property per line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA_i is a subset of a metric space for each i ∈ N,\n\nFor each n ∈ N, B_n is defined as the union of A_1 to A_n,\n\nB is defined as the union of all A_i for i ∈ N.\n\nThen the problem parts:\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that for any n ∈ N, the closure of B_n equals the union of the closures of A_i from i=1 to n,\n\nProve that the closure of B contains the union of the closures of A_i for all i ∈ N,\n\nProvide an example where the closure of B is a proper superset of the union of the closures of A_i.\n\nBut the original problem statement in the user's question says:\n\n\"Prove (for any) n ∈ N that closure(B_n) = union_{i=1}^n closure(A_i). If B = union_{i=1}^infty A_i, prove that closure(B) ⊇ union_{i=1}^infty closure(A_i). Give an example to show that this containment might be proper.\"\n\nSo I need to present the problem as three parts, as per the original.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\nA_i is a subset of a metric space for each i ∈ N,\n\nB_n is the union of A_1 to A_n for each n ∈ N,\n\nB is the union of A_i for all i ∈ N.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that for any n ∈ N, the closure of B_n equals the union of the closures of A_i from i=1 to n,\n\nProve that the closure of B contains the union of the closures of A_i for all i ∈ N,\n\nProvide an example where the closure of B is a proper superset of the union of the closures of A_i.\n\nBut the original problem's wording is slightly different. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n\"Prove (for any) n ∈ N that closure(B_n) = union_{i=1}^n closure(A_i). If B = union_{i=1}^infty A_i, prove that closure(B) ⊇ union_{i=1}^infty closure(A_i). Give an example to show that this containment might be proper.\"\n\nSo the problem is three tasks. The assumptions are given in the initial statements.\n\nSo in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach A_i is a subset of a metric space,\n\nFor each n ∈ N, B_n is defined as the union of A_1 to A_n,\n\nB is defined as the union of all A_i for i ∈ N.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that for any n ∈ N, the closure of B_n equals the union of the closures of A_i from i=1 to n,\n\nProve that the closure of B contains the union of the closures of A_i for all i ∈ N,\n\nGive an example where this containment is proper.\n\nYes, that's correct. Each assumption is a separate line. The problem includes the three tasks as stated.",
