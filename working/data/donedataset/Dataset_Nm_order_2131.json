    "Content": "Let $R$ be a Rng (a ring which does not necessarily have a $1$). We call an element $a$ regular if $xa=0$ implies $x=0$ and $ax=0$ implies $x=0$. Prove $R$ cannot have exactly five regular elements. This problem is from the Galois-Noether competition. This is the progress so far. regular elements are closed under multiplication, their multiplications are cancellative. Therefore we can conceive the set $M$ of regular elements, if it had order $5$ then it would be a finite cancellative semigroup, hence a group. Since $5$ is prime it would have to be a cyclic group. Therefore $M$, with multiplication, would be isomorphic to $\\mathbb Z_5$. I don't now if this is useful, but this is what I've found, I also have to thank Anon from chat for his help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $u$ be the unit in the group $M$ and let $S$ be the set of elements of $r\\in R$ such that $ru=ur=r$.  Then $S$ is a subrng of $R$ and contains all of $M$, and in fact $S$ is a ring (with unit $u$).  Note furthermore that any unit of $S$ is in $M$, since $xy=yx=u\\in M$ implies $x$ and $y$ are regular.  (Edit: In fact, $S$ is all of $R$; see anon's comment below.) We thus are reduced to showing that no ring $S$ can have exactly $5$ units.  To show this, note that $-1$ is always a unit, but $\\mathbb{Z}/5$ contains no nontrivial elements of order $2$, so we must have $1=-1$ in $S$.  Thus $S$ is an algebra over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.  We may also assume that $S$ is generated by its units (otherwise, just consider the subring they generate).  Thus we have that $S$ is isomorphic to some quotient of the group ring $\\mathbb{F}_2[\\mathbb{Z}/5]\\cong \\mathbb{F}_2\\times \\mathbb{F}_{16}$.  The only such quotients are $0$, $\\mathbb{F}_2$, $\\mathbb{F}_{16}$, and $\\mathbb{F}_2\\times\\mathbb{F}_{16}$, none of which have exactly $5$ units.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that a Rng (a ring without necessarily having a multiplicative identity) cannot have exactly five non-zero divisors, which they refer to as regular elements. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem states that R is a Rng, so that's the first assumption. The definition of a regular element is given: an element a is regular if both xa=0 implies x=0 and ax=0 implies x=0. So each regular element is a non-zero divisor in both left and right multiplication. That should be the second assumption. Then, the problem says to prove that R cannot have exactly five regular elements. The progress mentioned in the question talks about the set M of regular elements being closed under multiplication, forming a cancellative semigroup, which becomes a group because it's finite. Since the order is 5, which is prime, it must be cyclic, isomorphic to Z5. However, the user is stuck here and needs to proceed. But for the purpose of structuring the problem, the key assumptions are about the Rng, the definition of regular elements, and the number of such elements being exactly five. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"Prove R cannot have exactly five regular elements.\" So the assumption is that R is a Rng, and the problem is to show that there can't be exactly five regular elements. But in the example given by the user, they included the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, there's no such additional assumption; the problem is general. However, in the user's example, they extracted specific conditions from the problem. Here, the problem is more straightforward. The key assumptions are:\n\n1. R is a Rng (ring without 1).\n2. An element a is regular if it is both left and right cancellative (i.e., non-zero divisors).\n3. The set M of regular elements has exactly five elements.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that such a Rng cannot exist. So the problem statement would be to prove that there's no Rng R where the set of regular elements has exactly five elements. Therefore, the assumptions would be the properties given in the problem, not additional conditions. The problem itself is to show impossibility under those conditions.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R is a Rng (a ring without a multiplicative identity).\n- An element a in R is regular if for all x in R, xa=0 implies x=0 and ax=0 implies x=0.\n- The set M of regular elements of R has exactly five elements.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a Rng R cannot exist.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Prove R cannot have exactly five regular elements.\" So the problem is to show that there's no Rng with exactly five regular elements. Therefore, the assumptions are the general conditions (R is a Rng, definition of regular elements) and the hypothetical scenario (there are exactly five regular elements), leading to a contradiction.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, they included an assumption from the problem statement that wasn't part of the original problem's explicit statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that wasn't part of the original problem. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back, the user's example might have a mistake. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the user intended to show how to structure a problem where an assumption is extracted. But in that case, perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user wants to follow that format.\n\nBut in the current problem, the assumptions should be the given conditions. The problem is to prove that a Rng cannot have exactly five regular elements. The assumptions here would be:\n\n1. R is a Rng (ring without 1).\n2. An element a in R is regular if xa=0 and ax=0 each imply x=0.\n3. The set of regular elements M has exactly five elements.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under these assumptions, a contradiction arises, hence such R cannot exist. So the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then state the problem as proving that R cannot exist under these conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- R is a Rng (ring without 1).\n- M is the set of regular elements (as defined) in R.\n- |M| = 5.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a Rng R cannot exist.\n\nBut the original problem statement is \"Prove R cannot have exactly five regular elements.\" So the problem is to show that there's no Rng with exactly five regular elements. Therefore, the assumptions would be that R is a Rng, the definition of regular elements, and the hypothetical existence of exactly five such elements, leading to the problem of proving this leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, following the example's structure (even if the example had an error), the formatted problem should list each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- R is a Rng (a ring without a multiplicative identity).\n- An element a in R is regular if for all x in R, xa=0 implies x=0 and ax=0 implies x=0.\n- The set M of regular elements in R has exactly five elements.\n\nProblem:\nProve that such a Rng R cannot exist.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. The original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. That suggests that maybe the user wants to extract specific conditions from the problem. However, in this current problem, the user hasn't added any extra conditions beyond the problem's own premises. So the formatted problem should include the necessary assumptions for the problem to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was incorrect, and the user wants the problem's assumptions as given, not including additional constraints. But given that the user provided that example, I have to follow it, even if there's a mistake. So in this case, the problem's assumptions are R is a Rng, regular elements are defined as such, and the number of regular elements is five. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those as assumptions and the problem statement as proving R cannot have exactly five regular elements.",
