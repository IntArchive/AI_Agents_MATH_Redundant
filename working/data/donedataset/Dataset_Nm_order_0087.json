    "Content": "In his gorgeous paper \"How to compute  $\\sum \\frac{1}{n^2}$ by solving triangles\" , Mikael Passare offers this idea for proving $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$: Proof of equality of square and curved areas is based on another picture: Recapitulation of Passare's proof using formulas is as follows: $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-nx}}{n}\\; dx\\; = -\\int_0^\\infty \\log(1-e^{-x})\\; dx\\; = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$ There is also another paper dealing with geometric proof of $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$, in an entirely different way.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to understand what the original question is asking.\n\nThe title of the question is \"Visual proof of ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/n⁴ = π⁴/90?\" and the user mentions Mikael Passare's geometric proof for ∑1/n² = π²/6. They tried to find a similar geometric proof for ∑1/n⁴ = π⁴/90 but didn't succeed, asking if others can.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The example given had assumptions listing each property or condition applied to one object. But looking at the original problem here, there's not much explicit assumptions given except maybe the context of the problem. The user references Passare's visual proof using geometric areas and integrals. So the key assumption here is that the problem is looking for a geometric or visual proof similar to Passare's method for the sum of 1/n². The problem statement is to prove the equality for the sum of 1/n⁴ using such a method.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the main assumption is the approach (geometric/visual) rather than mathematical conditions. The problem is to prove the sum equals π⁴/90, but with a specific method. So how do I phrase the assumption? The example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, maybe the assumption is the method of proof. But the user didn't state any additional conditions on n, since it's a standard infinite series. So perhaps the assumption is that the proof should be geometric/visual, similar to Passare's approach. However, the original example listed mathematical conditions, not methodological constraints.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say that assumptions should list the problem's conditions or properties applied to one object. But in this case, the problem is to find a proof of a certain type. The original problem may not have explicit mathematical assumptions beyond the series convergence. Hmm. The example given had the user adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, that wasn't present. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no—the example shows that the user restructured the problem, perhaps modifying the original problem's assumptions? Wait, maybe the example is a different case where the user had an original problem and restructured it with certain assumptions. But in the current problem, the user is trying to find a visual proof similar to Passare's for the sum of 1/n⁴. So the key points are:\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n⁴ equals π⁴/90 using a geometric or visual method similar to Passare's approach for the sum of 1/n². The original Passare proof used a geometric interpretation involving areas and integrals. Therefore, the assumption here would be that the proof must be visual or geometric in nature, similar to Passare's method. However, the original problem does not state any mathematical assumptions beyond the series definition. So perhaps there are no explicit mathematical assumptions, but the problem constraints imply the method. However, according to the user's example, the assumptions should list mathematical conditions. But in the current problem, there's no such condition. The series is standard, and the question is about the method of proof.\n\nHmm, maybe in this case, the assumptions would be about the convergence of the series or properties of the series, but the user didn't mention those. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are implicit in the problem's context. Since the problem is asking for a proof similar to Passare's, which involves integrals and geometric areas, maybe the assumption is that the proof should use integral transforms or geometric interpretations. However, according to the user's instructions, the assumption should list each condition applied to one object. Since there's no explicit mathematical condition given in the problem, maybe the assumption is that the series converges, or that the sum is equal to π⁴/90. But that's the problem statement itself. Alternatively, maybe the original problem doesn't have specific assumptions beyond the series definition, so the formatted problem would have no assumptions. But the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't have them. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the user modified the original problem. But in the example, the original problem's assumption was that n is an integer, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no—the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That would actually change the problem. So perhaps the example is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but in any case, the user's instruction might be different.\n\nBut in our current problem, the question is to prove the sum equals π⁴/90 using a visual method. The original problem's context is that the user tried to find a similar geometric proof as Passare's for the sum 1/n², which used a visual area comparison. Therefore, the key assumption here is the method of proof—geometric or visual. But according to the user's format, assumptions are properties or conditions applied to objects. The problem itself is about the sum, but the method is a constraint. However, in the example, the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, perhaps indicating that the user modified the problem. But in this case, there's no such modification. The problem as stated is to prove the sum equals π⁴/90 with a visual proof. So maybe there are no specific mathematical assumptions beyond the series definition, but the problem's context implies the method. However, the user's format requires listing assumptions. If there are no explicit mathematical assumptions, maybe we need to infer or state the method as an assumption. But according to the example, assumptions are about mathematical conditions. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which are mathematical conditions. So perhaps in this case, since there are no additional mathematical conditions given, the assumption is simply that the series converges, but that's inherent in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, but according to the user's example, they list even the obvious ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as is, and the assumption is just the convergence of the series. But in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, so the assumption was n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they added n is divisible by 7, which seems to be a mistake. Wait, the original example might have been altered by the user to demonstrate the formatting, not an actual problem. So maybe in this case, for the current problem, the only assumption is that the series converges, but that's part of the problem statement. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe there are no assumptions, and the user just lists the problem. However, according to the example, even if there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem's statement, they should be listed. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumption is that n is a positive integer, since the sum starts at n=1. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nBut the problem is about the sum from n=1 to infinity. However, the series terms are 1/n⁴, which are defined for positive integers n. But the problem statement is to prove the sum equals π⁴/90. So maybe the assumption is that the series is summed over positive integers. However, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer. So following that, here n is a positive integer. But the problem doesn't state that as an assumption, it's part of the sum's notation. However, according to the example, such conditions are listed as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^4} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{90}$$ using a geometric or visual method similar to Mikael Passare's proof for $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$.\n\nBut the original question mentions that the user tried to find a similar way and asks if others can. So the problem is to find such a proof. The key part is the method—geometric/visual. But according to the user's format, the assumptions are mathematical conditions. The method is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions would be the mathematical conditions, which here is that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1 and goes to infinity). So I think that's the only assumption here. The problem is to prove the sum equals π⁴/90 using a geometric method akin to Passare's.",
