    "AcceptedAnswer": "$x+y = \\frac{xy}{z} $ is an integer, so $ z \\mid xy$ . Let $z = z_x \\times z_y $ where $z_x \\mid x$ and $z_y \\mid y$ . (Because $ \\gcd(x,y) = 1 $ , hence these are uniquely determined.) Let $x = z_x \\times x_x$ and $y = z_y \\times y_y$ , where every variable is an integer. Then we have that $z_xx_x  + z_y y_y = x_xy_y$ Apply the condition that $\\gcd(x,y,z)=1$ to conclude that $x_x  | y_y $ and $y_y | x_x$ . (Fill in this argument. If you want a further hint ... $ \\gcd(x,y,z) = 1 \\Rightarrow \\gcd(x_x, z_y ) = 1$ . Since $x_x(z_x-x_y) = -z_y y_y$ hence $ x_x \\mid y_y$ Hence $\\sqrt{x+y} = x_x$ is an integer.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The question says: Let x, y, z be positive integers with greatest common divisor 1. If 1/x + 1/y = 1/z, then show that sqrt(x + y) is an integer. \n\nFirst, I need to parse all the assumptions and what needs to be proven. The assumptions are that x, y, z are positive integers, their gcd is 1, and they satisfy the equation 1/x + 1/y = 1/z. The goal is to show that the square root of (x + y) is an integer. \n\nWait, the original problem mentions that the greatest common divisor of x, y, z is 1. That's important. So they can't all share a common factor greater than 1. But sometimes in these problems, even if the gcd is 1 for all three, pairs might still have common factors. I need to keep that in mind.\n\nStarting with the equation: 1/x + 1/y = 1/z. Let's rewrite this equation to find a relationship between x, y, z. Combining the fractions on the left gives (y + x)/(xy) = 1/z. Then cross-multiplying, we get z(x + y) = xy. So, xy = z(x + y). Rearranging terms, we can write this as xy - zx - zy = 0. Hmm, maybe adding z² to both sides would help factor it? Let's try: xy - zx - zy + z² = z². Then, factoring the left side: (x - z)(y - z) = z². That's a common technique in these types of equations.\n\nSo now we have (x - z)(y - z) = z². Since x, y, z are positive integers, x - z and y - z must also be positive integers. Let me denote a = x - z and b = y - z. Then, ab = z². Since gcd(x, y, z) = 1, I need to see how this affects a and b.\n\nGiven that ab = z², and a and b are positive integers, this suggests that a and b are divisors of z². Moreover, since z² is a square, a and b should be squares themselves or products of squares, but considering their gcd. Wait, but since ab = z², and the gcd of x, y, z is 1, perhaps a and b are coprime? Let me check.\n\nSuppose gcd(a, b) = d. Then d divides a and d divides b. Since a = x - z and b = y - z, then d divides (x - z) and (y - z). Then d divides (x - z) - (y - z) = x - y. But I also know that gcd(x, y, z) = 1. If d divides x - z and y - z, and also divides z, then d divides x and y as well. But since gcd(x, y, z) = 1, d must be 1. Therefore, a and b are coprime.\n\nSince a and b are coprime and their product is z², which is a square, both a and b must themselves be squares. Because in the prime factorization of z², each prime's exponent is even. If a and b are coprime, they share no common primes, so each prime factor of a must have an even exponent in a, and similarly for b. Therefore, a and b are perfect squares.\n\nLet me write a = m² and b = n², where m and n are positive integers. Then z² = a * b = m²n², so z = mn. Therefore, x = a + z = m² + mn, and y = b + z = n² + mn. Then x + y = m² + mn + n² + mn = m² + 2mn + n² = (m + n)². \n\nTherefore, sqrt(x + y) = m + n, which is an integer. That completes the proof. \n\nWait, let's verify the gcd condition. The original problem states that gcd(x, y, z) = 1. Let's check if our parametrization satisfies that. From x = m² + mn, y = n² + mn, and z = mn. Let's compute gcd(x, y, z). \n\nSuppose d divides x, y, z. Then d divides z = mn. Also, d divides x = m(m + n) and y = n(m + n). Since d divides mn and also divides m(m + n) and n(m + n). Let me see: if d divides m and n, then since gcd(x, y, z) = 1, d must be 1. But wait, in our parametrization, m and n might have a common divisor. \n\nWait, actually, when we set a = m² and b = n², since a and b are coprime, m and n must also be coprime. Because if m and n had a common prime p, then p² would divide both a and b, contradicting gcd(a, b) = 1. Therefore, m and n are coprime. \n\nTherefore, z = mn, and since m and n are coprime, the prime factors of z are the union of the primes of m and n. Now, x = m(m + n) and y = n(m + n). Let's compute gcd(x, y, z). \n\ngcd(m(m + n), n(m + n), mn). Since m and n are coprime, gcd(m, n) = 1. Let's consider gcd(m(m + n), n(m + n)) = gcd(m(m + n), n(m + n)) = (m + n) * gcd(m, n) = (m + n)*1 = m + n. Then, the gcd(x, y) = m + n. Then, gcd(gcd(x, y), z) = gcd(m + n, mn). Since m and n are coprime, any common divisor of m + n and mn must divide (m + n) and mn. Let d be a common divisor. Then d divides m + n and mn. Since m and n are coprime, any prime divisor of m cannot divide n, so primes dividing m are in m and primes dividing n are in n. So if d divides mn and d divides m + n, then d must divide both m + n and m, which would mean d divides n. Similarly, d divides m + n and n, so d divides m. But since gcd(m, n)=1, d must be 1. Therefore, gcd(m + n, mn) =1. Hence, gcd(x, y, z) =1. \n\nTherefore, our parametrization satisfies the gcd condition. So everything checks out. Therefore, x + y = (m + n)^2, so sqrt(x + y) is an integer. \n\nSo the key steps were rewriting the equation to (x - z)(y - z) = z², recognizing that x - z and y - z must be coprime squares, leading to x + y being a perfect square. The gcd condition is satisfied because m and n are coprime, ensuring that the overall gcd of x, y, z is 1.",
