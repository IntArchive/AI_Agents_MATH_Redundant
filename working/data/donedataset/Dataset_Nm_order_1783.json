    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the original problem again to understand it properly. The user is asking about the function f(x) = xφ(x), where φ is Euler's totient function. They noticed that when they compute this function for numbers from 1 to 1000, there are no duplicates in the results, which suggests that the function might be injective. Their questions are: first, is this function actually one-to-one (injective), and second, if it is, can someone provide a simple proof sketch?\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given by the user for the previous problem listed assumptions line by line, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me think about the assumptions here.\n\nThe function in question is f(x) = xφ(x). Euler's totient function φ(x) is defined for positive integers, so x must be a positive integer. The user tested this for x from 1 to 1000, but the problem is about the general case. The key assumption here is that x and y are positive integers such that xφ(x) = yφ(y). The problem is to show that this equality implies x = y, which would prove that f is injective on the positive integers.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that x and y are positive integers, and that f(x) = xφ(x). However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. The original example had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" In this case, the variables x and y are integers, but maybe more specifically positive integers. Also, the function f is defined as xφ(x). So perhaps the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\nf(x) = xφ(x),\nφ(x) is Euler's totient function.\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't explicitly state that x and y are positive integers, but since φ(x) is defined for positive integers, that's an implicit assumption. The user's code example uses n in the range 1 to 1000, which are positive integers, so it's safe to assume x and y are positive integers here.\n\nThe problem statement is to show that if xφ(x) = yφ(y), then x = y, which proves injectivity.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\nφ(x) is Euler's totient function,\nf(x) = xφ(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that if xφ(x) = yφ(y), then x = y.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So each assumption line should mention only one object and one property. For example, in the example, it was \"$n$ is an integer\", then \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, the variables x and y are both positive integers. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\nφ denotes Euler's totient function,\nf is defined as f(x) = xφ(x).\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to show that xφ(x) = yφ(y) implies x = y.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single condition on a single object. So φ being Euler's totient function is one assumption, f being defined as xφ(x) is another. Then x and y being positive integers each as separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"x and y are positive integers\" as one line. But in the example given, each assumption was for a single object. For example, in the original example, the first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", then \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So perhaps each variable is treated separately. But in this problem, x and y are both variables in the problem. The problem is about the equality xφ(x) = yφ(y) leading to x = y. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\nφ(n) is Euler's totient function for any positive integer n,\nf(n) = nφ(n) for any positive integer n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that xφ(x) = yφ(y) implies x = y.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement can be phrased more succinctly as per the user's original question. The original problem's title was \"Why is f(x) = xφ(x) injective, i.e. xφ(x) = yφ(y) ⇒ x = y\". So the problem is exactly that implication. Therefore, the problem statement would be to prove that xφ(x) = yφ(y) implies x = y.\n\nSo the assumptions would be the necessary conditions for that implication to hold. Since φ is defined for positive integers, x and y must be positive integers. So the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a positive integer\n- y is a positive integer\n- φ is Euler's totient function\n- f(x) = xφ(x)\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were for the problem's variables. In this case, the problem is about x and y being positive integers, so each of those is an assumption. The function f is defined as xφ(x), and φ is Euler's totient function. Therefore, each of these is an assumption.\n\nI think that's the correct way to structure it. Let me check the example again. In the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in that case, the problem might not require n to be divisible by 7, but maybe the user included that as part of their example. Wait, looking back at the original example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe there was a mistake in the example? Wait, perhaps the original problem had a different assumption. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Let me check again.\n\nIn the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would not require n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions here.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, maybe the user made a mistake. But regardless, the instruction says to list all assumptions of the problem. In the case of the current problem, the assumptions would be that x and y are positive integers, since φ is defined there, and the function f is xφ(x). The problem is to show injectivity, i.e., xφ(x)=yφ(y) implies x=y.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\nφ(x) is Euler's totient function,\nf(x) is defined as x multiplied by φ(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that xφ(x) = yφ(y implies x = y.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So x being a positive integer is one line, y being another, φ being Euler's function, and f's definition.\n\nSo the formatted answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\nφ(x) is Euler's totient function,\nf(x) is defined as x multiplied by φ(x).\nProblem:\nProve that $x\\phi(x) = y\\phi(y) \\Rightarrow x = y$.\n###",
