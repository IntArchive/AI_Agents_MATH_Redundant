    "Content": "An algebra $A$ over $F$ is said to be a graded algebra if as a vector space over $F$, $A$ can be written in the form $$A=\\bigoplus_{i=0}^\\infty A_i$$ for subspaces $A_i$ of $A$ along with other properties. And a graded ideal $I$ in a graded algebra $A$ is an ideal $I$ for which as a subspace of $A$, $$I = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^\\infty (I \\cap A_i)$$ In Steve Roman's book \"Advanced Linear Algebra\" it claims that if $I$ is a graded ideal in $A$, then the quotient ring $A/I$ is also graded, since $$\\frac{A}{I} = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{A_i+I}{I}$$\nCan someone give a careful proof of this? I am familiar with the coset or equivalence relation construction behind $A/I$ as being interpreted as identifying elements of $I$ with $0$. But the numerator $A_i+I$ on the right side is an unfamiliar sight. Presumably a proof will enlighten me on how to think of it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Quotient groups commute with direct sums. Therefore, $A/I = \\bigoplus_i A_i / (I \\cap A_i)$ as abelian groups. But $A_i / (I \\cap A_i) \\cong (A_i+I)/I$ (second isomorphism theorem). (Notice that every element in this group is the coset of some element of $A_i$, but we cannot write $A_i/I$ since $I \\subseteq A_i$ does not hold.) That the multiplication rule $(A_i + I)/I \\cdot (A_j + I)/I \\subseteq (A_{i+j} + I)$ holds, follows directly from $A_i \\cdot A_j \\subseteq A_{i+j}$. Explicitly, we call an element of $A/I$ to be homogeneous of degree $i$ if it is represented by some element of $A$ which is homogeneous of degree $i$. You could also verify that this makes $A/I$ a graded algebra this way, using elements, if you like.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a structured format where assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, followed by the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The problem is about quotient rings of graded algebras. The user mentions that in Roman's book, if I is a graded ideal in a graded algebra A, then A/I is also graded, with the decomposition into the direct sum of (A_i + I)/I. The task is to provide a careful proof of this statement.\n\nNow, let's extract the assumptions. The key elements here are:\n\n1. A is an algebra over a field F.\n2. A is a graded algebra, meaning it can be written as a direct sum of subspaces A_i for i starting from 0 to infinity.\n3. Each A_i is a subspace of A.\n4. I is an ideal of A.\n5. I is a graded ideal, which means it decomposes as a direct sum of (I ∩ A_i) for each i.\n6. The quotient ring A/I is to be considered with the given decomposition.\n\nEach assumption should be listed separately. Let me check if each point addresses only one property and one object. \n\n1. A is an algebra over F. That's one property of A.\n2. A is graded: decomposed into a direct sum of subspaces A_i. This is another property of A.\n3. Each A_i is a subspace of A. This is a property of each A_i.\n4. I is an ideal of A. Property of I.\n5. I is a graded ideal: decomposed into a direct sum of (I ∩ A_i). Another property of I.\n6. The problem is about the structure of A/I. Not an assumption, but part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem statement is to show that A/I is graded with the given decomposition. So the assumptions are the first five points. Let me verify again. The problem is to prove that A/I is graded, given that A is a graded algebra and I is a graded ideal. The user also mentions understanding cosets but is unfamiliar with the numerator A_i + I. The proof needs to clarify how the direct sum decomposition works in the quotient.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include all the given conditions in the problem. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an algebra over F,\nA is graded: A = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ A_i with each A_i a subspace,\nI is a graded ideal of A: I = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ (I ∩ A_i).\n\nProblem:\nProve that A/I is a graded algebra with decomposition A/I = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ (A_i + I)/I.\n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"the quotient ring A/I is also graded, since [decomposition].\" So the problem is to prove that the given decomposition makes A/I a graded algebra. So the key assumptions are that A is a graded algebra and I is a graded ideal. The problem is to show the quotient has the direct sum decomposition as stated.\n\nChecking the example provided by the user: in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Then the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition.\n\nSo here, the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is an algebra over F.\n- A is a graded algebra: A = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ A_i (as vector spaces), where each A_i is a subspace.\n- I is a graded ideal of A: I = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ (I ∩ A_i).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that A/I is a graded algebra with the given decomposition.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, one condition per line. The problem statement is to prove the decomposition. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem says: \"An algebra A over F is said to be a graded algebra if...\", \"a graded ideal I in a graded algebra A is an ideal I for which...\", then claims that A/I is graded. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a graded algebra over F (i.e., it has the direct sum decomposition into subspaces A_i).\n2. I is a graded ideal of A (i.e., it has the direct sum decomposition into I ∩ A_i).\n\nThus, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an algebra over F,\nA is graded with decomposition A = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ A_i (as vector spaces),\nEach A_i is a subspace of A,\nI is an ideal of A,\nI is graded with decomposition I = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ (I ∩ A_i).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the quotient ring A/I is a graded algebra with decomposition A/I = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ (A_i + I)/I.\n\nBut wait, in the example, each assumption is one line, each addressing only one property. So \"A is an algebra over F\" is one line. \"A is graded with decomposition...\" is another. However, \"Each A_i is a subspace\" is another. But maybe in the original problem, the definition of graded algebra includes the decomposition into subspaces. So perhaps \"A is a graded algebra over F\" implies that it's a direct sum of subspaces. But maybe in the problem statement, the user redefines graded algebra. Let's check the original question:\n\nOriginal question says: \"An algebra A over F is said to be a graded algebra if as a vector space over F, A can be written in the form A = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ A_i for subspaces A_i of A along with other properties.\"\n\nSo the user mentions that being a graded algebra requires the decomposition into subspaces A_i, along with other properties. But in the problem statement, when they refer to A being a graded algebra, they have already considered that decomposition. So perhaps the key assumptions here are:\n\n- A is a graded algebra (so already has the decomposition into A_i subspaces)\n- I is a graded ideal (so decomposition into I ∩ A_i)\n\nBut according to the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line, even if one is a consequence. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that seems incorrect. Wait, in the original example, the problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like the user made a mistake. Because the original problem is for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Which would restrict the problem. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. Perhaps that's an error in the example. So maybe the user intended to filter out redundant information but in this case, introduced an error. So I need to be careful.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is about graded algebras and graded ideals. The assumptions needed are that A is a graded algebra, I is a graded ideal. Then the problem is to prove A/I is graded with that decomposition.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an algebra over F,\nA is a graded algebra: A = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ A_i (as vector spaces),\nEach A_i is a subspace of A,\nI is an ideal of A,\nI is a graded ideal: I = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ (I ∩ A_i).\n\nBut wait, \"Each A_i is a subspace\" is part of the definition of a graded algebra, as given in the problem statement. So when the user says \"An algebra A over F is said to be a graded algebra if as a vector space over F, A can be written in the form A = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ A_i for subspaces A_i of A along with other properties.\" So the decomposition into subspaces is part of the definition. Therefore, the assumption that A is a graded algebra already includes that it's a direct sum of subspaces. So maybe \"Each A_i is a subspace of A\" is redundant if we already assume A is graded. But perhaps the example shows that even if some conditions are part of the definition, they are listed as separate assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't assume n is divisible by 7. Therefore, the example might have been structured incorrectly, possibly by mistake. However, the user provided that example as the desired format. So perhaps even if some assumptions are part of the definition, they are to be listed separately. For instance, in the current problem, A being a graded algebra includes the decomposition into subspaces, but we still list \"A is a graded algebra\" and \"Each A_i is a subspace of A\" as separate assumptions. Similarly, for the graded ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's intention is to list all explicit conditions given in the problem, even if they are part of the definition. For example, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But this is conflicting, so perhaps the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the user's structure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in this problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. A is an algebra over F.\n2. A is a graded algebra (i.e., A = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ A_i with each A_i a subspace).\n3. I is an ideal of A.\n4. I is a graded ideal (i.e., I = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ (I ∩ A_i)).\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. Even though being a graded algebra includes the decomposition, the user in the example listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, we might list \"A is a graded algebra\" and \"A is written as a direct sum of subspaces A_i\" as separate assumptions. But according to the problem statement, being a graded algebra already includes the direct sum decomposition. So perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we have to follow the same approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was misformatted. Let me re-examine the example:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. This changes the problem. So perhaps the example is wrong, but since the user provided it, they might want us to follow the format even if the content is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, perhaps we should list all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement, even if they are part of the definition.\n\nOriginal problem mentions:\n\n- A is an algebra over F.\n- A is graded: written as direct sum of subspaces A_i.\n- I is a graded ideal: written as direct sum of I ∩ A_i.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an algebra over F,\nA is a graded algebra (A = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ A_i as vector spaces),\nEach A_i is a subspace of A,\nI is an ideal of A,\nI is a graded ideal (I = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ (I ∩ A_i)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the quotient ring A/I is a graded algebra with decomposition A/I = ⨁_{i=0}^∞ (A_i + I)/I.\n\nThis seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property of one object. The problem is then to show the decomposition of the quotient.",
