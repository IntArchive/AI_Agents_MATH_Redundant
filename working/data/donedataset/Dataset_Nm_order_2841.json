    "Content": "I found a proof in the book Fourier Analysis On Number Fields that the closure of any subgroup is a subgroup, using the continuity argument along with the nets. Nevertheless, the following proof seems also plausible, but is it valid? Statement : If $H$ is a subgroup of a topological group $G$, then so is its closure in $G$. Denote the closure of $H$ by $H^{closure}$. Let h,h' be two elements in $H^{closure}$, and let $U$ be a neighbourhood of the unity in $G$. Since h and h' lie in $H^{closure}$, there are elements a, a' in $U$ such that ha$\\in H$, h'a'$\\in H$. Then, as the congugation function is continuous, the left and the right toplogies are the same, and hence there are b, b' $\\in U$ such that hah'a'= bhh'a'= bh\"=h\"b' $\\in H$, where h\" is in $H^{closure}H$ $\\subseteq H^{closure}$. As to $H^{closure}H$ $\\subseteq H^{closure}$, take two elements e $\\in H^{closure}$, f $\\in H$, and $v$ in $V$, an arbitrary neighbourhood of unity in $G$. Then there is an element $g$ in $V$ such that $efv=(eg)f \\in HH \\in H$. So $H^{closure}H$ $\\subseteq H^{closure}$. C.Q.F.D. The proof for the inversion is similar ; is there any problem in the argument? Thank a lot here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Sorry... this is not the answer to your question, but notice that the product with inversion $f: G \\times G \\to G$ defined by $f(x,y) = xy^{-1}$ is continuous. Therefore, $f^{-1}(\\overline{H})$ is closed.\nNow, notice that $H \\times H \\subset f^{-1}(\\overline{H})$.\nSo, taking closures,\n$$\n  \\overline{H \\times H}\n  \\subset\n  f^{-1}(\\overline{H}).\n$$\nNow, you just have to show that $\\overline{H} \\times \\overline{H} \\subset \\overline{H \\times H}$, to conclude that\n$$\n  f(\\overline{H} \\times \\overline{H})\n  \\subset\n  \\overline{H}.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the given structure. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether their proof about the closure of a subgroup in a topological group being a subgroup is valid. They presented their proof and want to know if there are any issues with it. The example provided by the user involves showing that the closure of a subgroup H in a topological group G is itself a subgroup. They use arguments involving neighborhoods, continuity of group operations, and some manipulations with elements in the closure.\n\nThe task is to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The Assumptions should list all the conditions applied to one object each. The Problem is the actual statement to be proved.\n\nFirst, identifying the assumptions from the problem. The original problem states that H is a subgroup of a topological group G, and the closure of H (denoted H^{closure}) needs to be shown as a subgroup. The user's proof uses properties of topological groups, like continuity of group operations (multiplication and inversion), and that left and right topologies coincide (which is a property of topological groups). So the key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. G is a topological group. (This encompasses both the group structure and the topological structure being compatible.)\n2. H is a subgroup of G. (This is given; the problem is about the closure of H.)\n3. The closure operation is taken in the topological space G. (Since they mention \"closure in G\".)\n4. The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous. (This is part of the definition of a topological group, but maybe it's worth listing as separate assumptions? Wait, in the problem statement, the user refers to the conjugation function being continuous and that left and right topologies are the same. But continuity of multiplication and inversion is inherent in the definition of a topological group. So perhaps the main assumptions are G being a topological group and H being a subgroup.)\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: G is a topological group. (This covers the continuity of group operations and the topology.)\n\nAssumption 2: H is a subgroup of G. (Given in the problem statement.)\n\nProblem: Prove that the closure of H in G is a subgroup of G.\n\nWait, but the user's proof also mentions that left and right topologies are the same. Is that an assumption or a property of topological groups? In general, in a topological group, the left and right uniform structures may differ, but the group is compatible with the topology under both left and right multiplication. However, the user specifically states \"since the conjugation function is continuous, the left and the right topologies are the same.\" Wait, conjugation being continuous is part of the properties of a topological group? Let me check.\n\nIn a topological group, the group operation and inversion are continuous. Conjugation is a specific operation: for a fixed g, the map x ↦ gxg⁻¹. Since multiplication is continuous and inversion is continuous, conjugation is continuous. So that's already covered under the definition of a topological group. The fact that left and right topologies coincide might be a consequence of the group being a topological group, but maybe in some contexts, this is an additional assumption? However, standard definitions of topological groups do have that the left and right translations are homeomorphisms, which might imply that the topology is compatible with both left and right multiplication. So perhaps the user's mention of left and right topologies being the same is part of the properties derived from being a topological group, not an extra assumption. Therefore, the main assumptions are just G being a topological group and H being its subgroup.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: \nG is a topological group,\nH is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem: Prove that the closure of H in G is a subgroup of G.\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem statement is phrased as \"If H is a subgroup of a topological group G, then so is its closure in G.\" So that's the problem statement. So the assumptions are indeed the two points above. The rest of the user's text is their attempted proof and questions about its validity, which are part of the original question but not part of the structured problem. Our task is to extract the problem and its assumptions, filtering out the proof attempt and other details.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$G$ is a topological group,\n$H$ is a subgroup of $G$.\nProblem:\nProve that the closure of $H$ in $G$ is a subgroup of $G$.",
