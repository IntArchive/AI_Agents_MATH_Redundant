    "Content": "Let $P$ be a $2016$ sided polygon with all its adjacent sides perpendicular to each other, i.e., all its internal angles are either $90$°or $270$°. If the lengths of its sides are odd integers, prove that its area is an even integer. I think visualising what this polygon might look like would more or less be the key to getting started on the problem, but I'm having quite a hard time doing so. Since the internal angles are all $90$° or $270$°, I think the shape would look like a rectangle or a square with smaller squares or rectangles protruding out from each side — but mini rectangles protruding from sides would not be possible because degrees of $180$° are not allowed. And to prove that the area is an even integer, if there are mini squares protruding from the sides there will have to be even number of those squares in total. And then I also need to make sure that at least the width or length of 'bigger' square or rectangle is even. But I seem to get stuck trying to draw a possible diagram...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Not a complete proof. However, maybe you can visualize the polygon like this: All the internal angles are either $90^\\circ$ or $270^\\circ$. Another way of visualizing: Observe that you have a $12$-sided polygon here, comprised of $5$ squares. The next acceptable polygon would be this: Notice that $2$ sides are lost and $6$ more sides are added, thus we have a $16$-sided polygon. Notice too that there are $3$ more additional squares. Therefore, for a polygon in this form, the number sides can be expressed as:\n$$12+4x \\Rightarrow 12+4x=2016\\iff x=501$$\nUsing $x$, the number of squares that compose this polygon will be:\n$$5+3x\\Rightarrow 12+3\\cdot501=1508$$\nTherefore, we have an even number of squares therefore the area is an even integer.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, we have a 2016-sided polygon where all adjacent sides are perpendicular, meaning each internal angle is either 90° or 270°. All the side lengths are odd integers. We need to prove that the area is an even integer.\n\nFirst, visualizing this polygon. Since each angle is 90° or 270°, the polygon must be made up of a series of right-angled turns. But because 270° angles are allowed, it's like making a rectangle but sometimes taking a \"detour\" inward or outward, creating smaller squares or rectangles. However, since each turn is either a right angle or a \"reverse\" right angle (270°), the overall shape must close after 2016 sides. That's a lot of sides, but the key is that the sides alternate between horizontal and vertical directions because of the perpendicularity.\n\nNow, all sides are odd integers. So every horizontal and vertical segment has an odd length. But how does that affect the area? The area is going to be the sum of rectangles and maybe some smaller areas from the 270° turns. Wait, maybe there's a coordinate system approach here. If we think of the polygon as a path on a grid where each step is an odd length, moving either horizontally or vertically, turning 90° or 270° each time. The total displacement after 2016 sides should bring us back to the starting point since it's a polygon.\n\nAnother thought: Pick's Theorem. Pick's Theorem relates the area of a lattice polygon to the number of interior and boundary lattice points. The formula is Area = I + B/2 - 1, where I is the number of interior points and B the boundary points. If we can show that B is even, then since B/2 would be an integer, and I is an integer, the area would be an integer. But we need to show it's even. Wait, but Pick's Theorem might not directly help with the parity unless we can show that I + B/2 - 1 is even. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the coordinates of the vertices. Let's assume the polygon is on a grid with integer coordinates. Since all sides are odd lengths and directions alternate between horizontal and vertical, the coordinates of the vertices will alternate between even and odd. For example, starting at (0,0), moving right (east) by an odd number, so next coordinate is (odd, 0). Then moving north by an odd number, so (odd, odd). Then moving west, which would subtract an odd number from the x-coordinate, making it even. Then moving south, subtracting an odd from y, making it even. And so on. Each move alternates the parity of the coordinates. Since there are 2016 sides, which is a multiple of 4, the starting and ending points must have the same parity. Wait, starting at (0,0), after 4 steps, you end up back at (0,0) if it's a rectangle, but here it's a more complex polygon. But in any case, after even steps, the parity would cycle. But with 2016 sides, which is divisible by 4, perhaps the total displacement is zero, so the coordinates return to (0,0). Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: The area can be calculated using the shoelace formula. For a polygon with vertices (x_i, y_i), the area is 1/2 |sum_{i=1}^n (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|. Since all coordinates are integers, this area would be a half-integer, but the problem states it's an integer. Wait, but the problem says the area is an even integer, so the shoelace formula must give an even integer when multiplied by 2. Let me think. The shoelace sum would be an integer, so the area is half of that, which must be an integer. Therefore, the sum must be even. So we need to show that the shoelace sum is divisible by 4? Wait, because 1/2 * even integer is an integer. But we need the area to be even, so 1/2 * (sum) must be even, meaning sum must be divisible by 4. So the problem reduces to showing that the shoelace sum is a multiple of 4.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the coordinates modulo 2. Since all side lengths are odd, each move changes the coordinate by an odd number. Let's track the coordinates modulo 2. Starting at (0,0). Moving east (x increases by odd, so x becomes 1 mod 2). Then north, y becomes 1 mod 2. Then west, x becomes 0 mod 2. Then south, y becomes 0 mod 2. So every four moves, the coordinates cycle back modulo 2. But since there are 2016 sides, which is 4*504, after 2016 moves, we'd be back at (0,0) modulo 2 as well. Therefore, all vertices have coordinates that are either (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), or (1,1) modulo 2. The shoelace formula sum would then involve products of these coordinates. Let's consider each term x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i. If we can compute this modulo 4, maybe we can show that each term is 0 mod 4 or something, so that the total sum is 0 mod 4. Then 1/2 * sum would be 0 mod 2, meaning even.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each term x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i modulo 4. Let's see. Let me consider possible parities of x_i, y_i, x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}. Since each side is odd, moving from (x_i, y_i), which is (a,b) mod 2, the next coordinate after moving horizontally or vertically by odd would flip the parity. So for example, if we're at (0,0) and move east (x increases by odd), then next is (1,0). Then move north (y increases by odd) to (1,1). Then move west (x decreases by odd) to (0,1). Then move south (y decreases by odd) to (0,0). So modulo 2, the coordinates cycle through (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), etc. So for each consecutive vertex, their coordinates alternate in parity.\n\nTherefore, for any two consecutive vertices (x_i, y_i) and (x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}), one coordinate changes parity, and the other stays the same. For example, from (0,0) to (1,0): x changes, y same. Then to (1,1): y changes, x same. Then to (0,1): x changes, y same. Then to (0,0): y changes, x same. So each step alternates which coordinate changes.\n\nNow, looking at the term x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i. Let's take modulo 2 first. Suppose (x_i, y_i) is (0,0) and (x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) is (1,0). Then x_i y_{i+1} = 0*0 = 0, x_{i+1} y_i = 1*0 = 0, so the term is 0-0=0 mod 2. Similarly, if moving from (1,0) to (1,1): x_i=1, y_i=0; x_{i+1}=1, y_{i+1}=1. Term: 1*1 -1*0 =1 mod 2. Then next term from (1,1) to (0,1): x_i=1, y_i=1; x_{i+1}=0, y_{i+1}=1. Term:1*1 -0*1=1 mod 2. Then from (0,1) to (0,0): term 0*0 -0*1=0 mod 2. So over four steps, the terms modulo 2 are 0,1,1,0. Summing these gives 0+1+1+0=2 mod 4? Wait, but each term is modulo 2, but we need modulo 4. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of each move as contributing a vector. Since all sides are perpendicular, the polygon can be considered as a rectilinear polygon. For such polygons, there's a formula or property related to the area. Wait, maybe Green's theorem? If we integrate over the polygon, but that might not help directly.\n\nAnother angle: the parity of the area. Since all sides are odd, maybe when calculating the area, each rectangle formed by the sides has sides of odd length, but the product of two odds is odd. However, the total area is the sum of multiple such rectangles, possibly overlapping. If there are an even number of such odd areas, their sum would be even. But how to ensure that?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the polygon can be divided into unit squares, and the number of unit squares is even. But since all sides are odd, maybe each \"segment\" contributes an odd number of squares, but when combined in two directions, their product is odd. But again, summing multiple odd areas might result in even or odd depending on the number of terms. Hmm.\n\nWait, going back to the coordinate parity idea. If all coordinates alternate parity with each step, then when applying the shoelace formula, each term x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i can be analyzed modulo 4. Let's consider two consecutive vertices. Suppose we have a vertex (a, b) and the next vertex is either (a ± odd, b) or (a, b ± odd). Let's say we move horizontally from (a, b) to (a + odd, b). Then x_{i} = a, y_i = b; x_{i+1} = a + odd, y_{i+1} = b. The term becomes a*b - (a + odd)*b = - odd * b. Similarly, if moving vertically, from (a, b) to (a, b + odd), then the term is a*(b + odd) - a*b = a*odd.\n\nNow, since a and b are integers, and odd is an odd integer, let's look at these terms modulo 4. Let's suppose that the coordinates alternate parity as before. For example, starting at (0,0), then (odd, 0), then (odd, odd), then (even, odd), etc. So each coordinate alternates between even and odd as we move along the polygon. Let's track the parity of a and b in each term.\n\nIf moving horizontally: term is -odd * b. If b is even (0 mod 2), then term is -odd*even, which is even. If b is odd (1 mod 2), term is -odd*odd = -odd, which is -1 mod 2. But we need to see modulo 4.\n\nWait, maybe better to model the coordinates modulo 4. Let me try. Suppose a coordinate is even (0 mod 2) or odd (1 mod 2). Let's track each move's effect. But this might get too involved. Alternatively, note that each term x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i is equal to the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors (x_i, y_i) and (x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}). The determinant's parity might be relevant.\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire shoelace sum. Since the polygon is closed, the sum must be twice the area. So if we can show that this sum is divisible by 4, then the area would be divisible by 2, hence even.\n\nLet me try to compute the shoelace sum modulo 4. Each term is x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i. Let's see what each term can be modulo 4.\n\nGiven that each side length is odd, so each coordinate alternates between even and odd. For example, if you start at (0,0) (even, even), then moving east by odd, you get (1,0) (odd, even). Then moving north by odd, (1,1) (odd, odd). Then west by odd, (0,1) (even, odd). Then south by odd, (0,0) (even, even). This cycle repeats every 4 sides. So for each 4 sides, the coordinates cycle through (even, even), (odd, even), (odd, odd), (even, odd), back to (even, even). Now, looking at the terms for each pair:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (1,0): term is 0*0 -1*0 =0 mod 4.\nFrom (1,0) to (1,1): term is1*1 -1*0=1 mod4.\nFrom (1,1) to (0,1): term is1*1 -0*1=1 mod4.\nFrom (0,1) to (0,0): term is0*0 -0*1=0 mod4.\n\nSo over four sides, the terms sum to 0+1+1+0=2 mod4. Since there are 2016 sides, which is 4*504, there are 504 such cycles. Each cycle contributes 2 mod4, so total sum is 504*2=1008 mod4. But 504 is 504=126*4, so 504*2=1008. 1008 divided by 4 is 252, remainder 0. So total sum is 0 mod4. Therefore, the shoelace sum is divisible by4, so area is sum/2, which is divisible by2. Hence, area is even. That's the key!\n\nSo the crux is that each 4-side cycle contributes 2 mod4 to the shoelace sum, and with 2016 sides (divisible by4), the total sum is 0 mod4, hence area is even.",
