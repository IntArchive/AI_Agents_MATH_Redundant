    "Content": "I can prove the only if part.\nMy attempt to prove if part is the following: Given $n$ global sections $s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$ of a vector bundle $E$ on a smooth manifold $M$ such that they form a basis at each fibre, we construct a smooth map $M\\times \\mathbb R^n \\to E$ defined as $$(m, (x_1, ..., x_n))\\mapsto x_1s_1+...+x_ns_n$$\nIt is easy to see this map is injective, smooth and is linear isomorphism on fibers. However, I fail to prove the inverse is smooth because of two elementary reasons: If $s$ is an arbitrary smooth local section of $M$ to $E$, then s has a unique decomposition $s=x_1s_1(m)+...+x_ns_n(m)$ where $x_i$ are local functions. How do we show that they are smooth? If the statement above is shown, we can show every smooth section from $M$ to $E$ maps to a section from $M$ to $M\\times \\mathbb R^n$. Can this necessarily imply the map from $M\\times \\mathbb R^n$ to $E$ is smooth? Of course, my direction may be wrong, so if the standard approach is more straightforward, please let me know.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The trick is to work with a local trivialization of $E$ since smoothness of a map is a local property. Now, for both parts 1 and 2 use the fact that inverse of an invertible matrix $A$ depends smoothly on its entries and hence, solution vector of a linear system $Ax=b$ depends smoothly on $A$ and $b$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem as per the user's instructions. The original question is about proving that a vector bundle is trivial if there are n global sections forming a basis on each fiber. The user mentions they can prove the \"only if\" part but are stuck on the \"if\" part. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states there's a vector bundle E over a smooth manifold M with n global sections s_1 to s_n that form a basis at each fiber. So, each section is smooth since it's a global section of a vector bundle on a smooth manifold. The user's approach constructs a map from M x R^n to E, which is injective, smooth, and a linear isomorphism on fibers. The issue is proving the inverse is smooth.\n\nAssumptions should list each property applied to one object. So:\n\n- E is a vector bundle on a smooth manifold M.\n- E has n global sections s_1, s_2, ..., s_n.\n- For every point m in M, the sections s_1(m), ..., s_n(m) form a basis of the fiber E_m.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that E is trivial, i.e., isomorphic to the trivial bundle M x R^n. The user's specific problem is showing the inverse map is smooth, but the core problem as per the title is the equivalence (trivial iff there are such sections). Since the user is focusing on the \"if\" direction, the problem statement should reflect that.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have those three assumptions and the problem to prove E is trivial. The user's attempt is part of the original question but not part of the structured problem. The example given in the user's instruction includes specific mathematical expressions and conditions, so following that, the assumptions here are about the existence of the global sections forming a basis on each fiber.",
