    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem according to the specified format. The example provided shows breaking down the original problem into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the Math Stack Exchange question carefully. The title is \"If every eigenvalue of A is zero, does this mean A is a zero matrix?\" The question body states: \"If every eigenvalue of A is zero, show that A is nilpotent. I got this question as my homework. I am just wondering if every eigenvalue of A is zero, then A is zero, why bother to prove A is nilpotent.\"\n\nThe task is to filter out unrelated information and structure it into the Assumption and Problem sections. The example lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nLooking at the problem here: The main point is that every eigenvalue of matrix A is zero, and the task is to show A is nilpotent. The user is confused because they think if all eigenvalues are zero, maybe A should be the zero matrix, but the problem asks to prove nilpotent instead. So the key assumption here is that every eigenvalue of A is zero. The problem is to show A is nilpotent.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"If every eigenvalue of A is zero, show that A is nilpotent.\" The title asks if this implies A is zero. So the user is questioning why prove nilpotency instead of being zero. But in the problem statement, the actual task is to prove nilpotent. So the assumptions would be that A is a matrix (probably square) where all eigenvalues are zero, and the problem is to show A is nilpotent.\n\nIn the example, assumptions were listed as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the matrix A has all eigenvalues zero, but there's no mention of the size of the matrix. However, eigenvalues are defined for square matrices, so that's an implicit assumption. Should I include that? The original problem doesn't state it explicitly, but maybe I should. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were explicit. For instance, in the original example, the problem was about divisibility by 91, but the assumption included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted version, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption says \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe example given is: Original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is from a different problem where the original had a mistake, but the user provided an example. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, the task here is to process the current problem about the matrix A.\n\nSo, for the current problem: The user's question is to structure the problem. The problem given is: \"If every eigenvalue of A is zero, show that A is nilpotent.\" The user is confused why it's not zero matrix. So the key assumptions here are that A is a square matrix (since eigenvalues are defined for square matrices), and every eigenvalue of A is zero. The problem is to show that A is nilpotent. \n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\n- Every eigenvalue of A is zero.\n\nThen the problem is to show that A is nilpotent.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were split into separate lines, each addressing one property. So \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So here, \"A is a square matrix\" and \"every eigenvalue of A is zero\" are two separate assumptions. \n\nBut does the original problem mention that A is a square matrix? The problem statement says \"every eigenvalue of A\", which implies A is a square matrix, because only square matrices have eigenvalues. So the first assumption is that A is a square matrix. Second, every eigenvalue of A is zero. Then the problem is to show A is nilpotent.\n\nBut maybe the original problem assumes that the reader knows A is square. However, to be precise, we should include it as an assumption. Because in linear algebra, eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices.\n\nSo, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nEvery eigenvalue of A is zero.\n\nProblem:\nShow that A is nilpotent.\n\nThat seems correct. The user's confusion is thinking that if all eigenvalues are zero, then A is the zero matrix, but that's not necessarily true. For example, a Jordan block with zeros on the diagonal is nilpotent but not the zero matrix. Hence, the problem is to show nilpotency, not that it's zero. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are correct as above.",
