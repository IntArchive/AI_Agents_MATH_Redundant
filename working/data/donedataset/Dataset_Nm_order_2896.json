    "Content": "I am given this equation: \n$f^{-1}(B_1 \\cap B_2) = f^{-1}(B_1) \\cap f^{-1}(B_2)$ I want to prove it: what i did is I take any $a \\in f^{-1}(B_1 \\cap B_2)$, then there is $b \\in (B_1 \\cap B_2)$ so that $f(a)=b$. Because of $b \\in (B_1 \\cap B_2)$, it is true that $b \\in B_1$ and $b \\in B_2$, so $a \\in f^{-1}(B_1)$ and $a \\in f^{-1}(B_2)$. this means $f^{-1}(B_1 \\cap B_2) \\subseteq f^{-1}(B_1) \\cap f^{-1}(B_2)$. is it ok?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yeah...this can be actually written in this way; $a\\in f^{-1}(B_1\\cap B_2)$, means $f(a)\\in B_1\\cap B_2$ and so $f(a)\\in B_1$ and $f(a)\\in B_2$. Hence, $a\\in f^{-1}(B_1)$ and $a\\in f^{-1}(B_2)$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the preimage of the intersection of two sets B1 and B2 under a function f is equal to the intersection of the preimages of B1 and B2 individually. So, the equation is f⁻¹(B1 ∩ B2) = f⁻¹(B1) ∩ f⁻¹(B2). \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a preimage is. The preimage f⁻¹(B) of a set B under a function f is the set of all elements in the domain of f that map to elements in B. So, if a is in f⁻¹(B), then f(a) is in B. \n\nThe user started by taking an arbitrary element a in f⁻¹(B1 ∩ B2) and showed that a must also be in both f⁻¹(B1) and f⁻¹(B2), hence concluding that f⁻¹(B1 ∩ B2) is a subset of the intersection of f⁻¹(B1) and f⁻¹(B2). That part seems correct. But to prove equality, they need to show the reverse inclusion as well: that the intersection of the preimages is a subset of the preimage of the intersection. \n\nWait, let me think step by step. To prove two sets are equal, we usually show each is a subset of the other. The user did one direction. Let me check the other direction. Suppose a is in f⁻¹(B1) ∩ f⁻¹(B2). That means a is in f⁻¹(B1) and a is in f⁻¹(B2). Therefore, f(a) is in B1 and f(a) is in B2. So, f(a) is in B1 ∩ B2, which implies a is in f⁻¹(B1 ∩ B2). Therefore, the intersection of the preimages is a subset of the preimage of the intersection. Combining both inclusions gives equality. \n\nSo the user's initial step is correct for one direction. They might need to mention the reverse direction as well to complete the proof. Also, the problem doesn't specify whether f is a function between which sets, but generally, this property holds for any function. Are there any assumptions here? The problem as stated doesn't mention any specific conditions on f, B1, or B2. So maybe there are no additional assumptions needed beyond the basic definitions.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is about proving this equality. The user's attempt shows one direction and asks if it's okay. So in structuring the problem, the assumptions would be the basic properties of functions and preimages. But in the example given earlier, assumptions were about the objects involved. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. \n\nIn this case, since the problem is about set theory and functions, the assumptions would likely be that f is a function, and B1 and B2 are subsets of the codomain. But the problem as stated in the title doesn't specify these, so maybe the user is assuming that f is a function from a set X to a set Y, and B1, B2 are subsets of Y. \n\nBut the problem statement given by the user in the question is just the equation to prove, without additional conditions. So perhaps the assumptions are implicit: that f is a function, and B1, B2 are subsets of the codomain. However, in the example provided by the user, assumptions were made explicit even if they were part of the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem in the example changed it by adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem? Let me check.\n\nWait, the example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That might be a mistake, unless the example was incorrectly structured. Because in the original problem, the statement is for every integer n, but the formatted problem restricts n to being divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So perhaps there was an error in the example. But maybe the example was intended to show how to structure, even if the content was altered. So perhaps in the task, the assistant is supposed to filter unrelated information and list assumptions that are actually in the original problem. But in this case, the original problem about the function preimage doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond f being a function and B1, B2 being subsets. So the assumptions here would be that f is a function, B1 and B2 are subsets of the codomain of f. However, in the original problem, the user didn't specify these, but in the context of set theory, these are implicit. \n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the assistant should \"filter the unrelated information and structure that problem\" as per the given format, listing each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function,\nB₁ is a subset of the codomain of f,\nB₂ is a subset of the codomain of f.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the title is general. The user's question includes their attempt, but when structuring the problem, we need to extract the problem statement. The original question on Math Stack Exchange is titled \"how to prove f⁻¹(B₁ ∩ B₂) = f⁻¹(B₁) ∩ f⁻¹(B₂)\" and the content is \"I am given this equation... I want to prove it... is it ok?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that equality. So in terms of assumptions, the problem itself doesn't state any specific conditions beyond the general context. Therefore, the assumptions are inherent: f is a function, B₁ and B₂ are subsets of the codomain. So each of these can be listed as separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function,\nB₁ is a subset of the codomain of f,\nB₂ is a subset of the codomain of f.\n\nProblem: Prove that f⁻¹(B₁ ∩ B₂) = f⁻¹(B₁) ∩ f⁻¹(B₂).\n\nThat's the structured problem. The original problem didn't specify any extra conditions, so the assumptions are the basic ones needed for the preimage to make sense. The user's attempt didn't mention any specific conditions either, so the formatted problem should list those basic assumptions.",
