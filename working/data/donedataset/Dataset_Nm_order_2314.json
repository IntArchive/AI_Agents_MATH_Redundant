    "Content": "I was solving the integral $$I_n=\\int_0^{\\frac {\\pi}{2}} \\left(\\frac {\\sin ((2n+1)x)}{\\sin x}\\right)^2 dx$$ With $n\\ge 0$ And $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ On solving, I got $$I_n =\\frac {(2n+1)\\pi}{2}$$ But, due to curiosity, I started investigating the family of integrals as $$I_n(\\beta) =\\int_0^{\\frac {\\pi}{2}} \\left(\\frac {\\sin (2n+1)x}{\\sin x}\\right)^{\\beta} dx$$ On trying various values of $\\beta\\gt 2$ and $\\beta\\in \\mathbb{N}$ , I conjectured that $$I_n(\\beta) =c_{\\beta} \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$ where $c_{\\beta}$ denotes \"Number of arrays of $\\beta$ integers in $-n$ to $n$ with sum $0$ \" But, on trying a lot, I couldn't prove this statement. Also, I suppose that the statement could be proved with help of Dirichlet kernel, but I couldn't get the way out through it. Any help and hints to prove/disprove the conjecture are greatly appreciated.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and identify all the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about an integral conjecture. The user, after solving the integral for β=2, which resulted in (2n+1)π/2, started investigating for β>2. They conjecture that the integral I_n(β) equals c_β * π/2, where c_β is the number of arrays of β integers from -n to n that sum to zero.\n\nNow, to format this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. Let's list the assumptions one by one, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. n is a non-negative integer (since the original problem states n ≥ 0 and n ∈ ℕ).\n2. β is an integer greater than 2 (as per the problem statement: β > 2 and β ∈ ℕ).\n3. The integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2.\n4. The integrand is [(sin((2n+1)x)/sin x]^β.\n5. c_β is defined as the number of arrays of β integers in the range -n to n with a sum of 0.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that I_n(β) = c_β * π/2.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions that c_β is the number of such arrays. So the conjecture is that the integral equals this count multiplied by π/2. The problem is to prove or disprove this conjecture. The assumptions should include all the given conditions: n is a non-negative integer, β is an integer greater than 2, and the integral setup. Each of these needs to be separate points in the assumptions.\n\nLet me verify the example given. In the example, assumptions are n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. So each assumption is a single condition on a single object.\n\nApplying that here:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- β is an integer with β > 2.\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2].\n- The integrand is [(sin((2n+1)x))/sin x]^β.\n- c_β counts the number of β-length arrays of integers from -n to n summing to 0.\n\nWait, but maybe some of these can be combined? For example, the integrand and the interval are part of the problem setup. But according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So each condition on variables and the setup.\n\nBut the original problem states that β is a natural number greater than 2. So β ∈ ℕ and β > 2. So that's two conditions, but perhaps they can be combined as \"β is an integer greater than 2\" since ℕ includes positive integers. Similarly, n is a non-negative integer (since n ≥ 0 and n ∈ ℕ).\n\nThe integral's definition is part of the problem statement, but in the example, the expression for A(n) was part of the problem, not the assumption. So perhaps the structure is:\n\nAssumptions list the conditions on the variables and any other constraints. The problem statement includes the actual mathematical statement to prove.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem's assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the expression for A(n) is part of the problem statement.\n\nSo in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- β is an integer with β > 2.\n- The integral I_n(β) is defined as ∫₀^{π/2} [sin((2n+1)x)/sin x]^β dx.\n- c_β is the number of β-length arrays of integers from -n to n with sum 0.\n\nWait, but the integral's definition is part of the problem setup. However, in the example, the expression for A(n) was part of the problem statement. So perhaps the integral's definition is part of the problem, not the assumptions. Hmm, maybe the assumptions are only about the variables and their conditions, not the problem's setup.\n\nWait, in the example:\n\nAssumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nSo the expression of A(n) is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, in this current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n\n- β is an integer greater than 2.\n\n- c_β is the number of β-length arrays of integers from -n to n with sum 0.\n\nThe problem is to prove or disprove that the integral I_n(β) equals c_β * π/2.\n\nBut wait, the definition of the integral is part of the problem statement. So the problem statement should include the integral's expression.\n\nSo:\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that $$I_n(\\beta) = \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left( \\frac{\\sin((2n+1)x)}{\\sin x} \\right)^\\beta dx$$ is equal to $c_{\\beta} \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $c_{\\beta}$ is the number of arrays of $\\beta$ integers in $-n$ to $n$ with sum $0$.\n\nBut the example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So the problem includes the expression to prove.\n\nTherefore, in the current case, the problem statement would be as above, and the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n\n- β is an integer greater than 2.\n\nAdditionally, the integral is from 0 to π/2, but that's part of the problem statement. The other part is that c_β is defined as the number of arrays. However, in the example, the user didn't include the definition of A(n) in the assumptions; it was part of the problem.\n\nThus, the assumptions here are the conditions on n and β, and the problem includes the integral expression and the conjecture about c_β.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nβ is an integer with β > 2.\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $$I_n(\\beta) = \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left( \\frac{\\sin((2n+1)x)}{\\sin x} \\right)^\\beta dx$$ is equal to $c_{\\beta} \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $c_{\\beta}$ denotes the number of arrays of $\\beta$ integers in the range $-n$ to $n$ with sum $0$.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user says \"for integer β > 2\" and \"β ∈ ℕ\". Since β is a natural number greater than 2, so β ≥ 3. So the assumption is β is an integer greater than 2. The problem mentions that c_β is defined as the number of arrays. That definition is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the assumptions are just the conditions on n and β.\n\nThus, the final answer should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nβ is an integer greater than 2.\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $$I_n(\\beta) = \\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left( \\frac{\\sin ((2n+1)x)}{\\sin x} \\right)^{\\beta} dx$$ is equal to $c_{\\beta} \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $c_{\\beta}$ is the number of arrays of $\\beta$ integers in $-n$ to $n$ with sum $0$.\n\nYes, that looks correct. Each assumption is a separate condition on the variables. The problem includes the integral expression and the conjecture involving c_β.",
