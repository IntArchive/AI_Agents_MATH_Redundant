    "Content": "I'm having difficulty solving an exercise in my course. The question is: Prove that $n!\\geq 2^n$. We have to do this by induction. I started like this: The lowest natural number where the assumption is correct is $4$ as: $4! \\geq 2^4 \\iff 24 \\ge 16$. The assumption is: $n! \\ge 2^n$. Now proof for $(n+1)$ which brings me to: $(n+1)! \\ge 2^{(n+1)}$ I think I can rewrite it somehow like this: $$ {(n+1)} \\times {n!}  \\stackrel{\\text{(definition of factorial)}}{\\ge} 2^n \\times 2 $$ $$ (n+1) \\times 2^n \\ge 2^n \\times 2 $$ Then I think I can eliminate the $2^n$ and have something like this: $n+1 \\ge 2$, or $n \\ge 1$. But I think I'm wrong here some where and was hoping somebody has some advice on this. How can I prove the above assumption? Any help would be appreciated, kind regards.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In the induction step you want to show that if $k!\\ge 2^k$ for some $k\\ge 4$, then $(k+1)!\\ge 2^{k+1}$. Since you already know that $4!\\ge 2^4$, the principle of mathematical induction will then allow you to conclude that $n!\\ge 2^n$ for all $n\\ge 4$. You have all of the necessary pieces; you just need to put them together properly. Specifically, you can argue as follows. Suppose that $k!\\ge 2^k$, where $k\\ge 4$; this is your induction hypothesis. Then $$\\begin{align*}\n(k+1)! &= (k+1)k!\\text{ (by the definition of factorial)}\\\\\n&\\ge (k+1)2^k\\text{ (by the induction hypothesis)}\\\\\n&> 2\\cdot2^k\\text{ (since }k\\ge 4\\text{)}\\\\\n&= 2^{k+1}.\n\\end{align*}$$ This completes the induction step: it shows that if $k\\ge 4$, then $$k!\\ge 2^k \\implies (k+1)!\\ge 2^{k+1}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read through the user's question on Math Stack Exchange and filter out any unrelated information. The user is trying to prove that n! is greater than or equal to 2^n using mathematical induction. They started by checking the base case at n=4, which works because 24 ≥ 16. Then they assumed it's true for some n, and tried to show it holds for n+1. But they're getting stuck in the inductive step.\n\nNow, I need to list all the assumptions line by line. The problem specifies that the proof must be done by induction. The base case is n=4, so one assumption is that n is an integer greater than or equal to 4. The induction hypothesis is that the statement holds for some n, so another assumption is that n! ≥ 2^n for a particular n. The problem is to prove that (n+1)! ≥ 2^(n+1). \n\nWait, but the original problem just says \"Prove that n! ≥ 2^n by induction.\" So the base case is n=4, as the user mentioned. So the key assumptions here are that n is an integer and n ≥ 4. The induction step assumes the statement is true for n, and needs to prove for n+1. However, in the format, assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. The problem's assumptions would include the method (induction), the domain of n (integers ≥4), and perhaps the induction hypothesis. But according to the example provided, assumptions are the conditions applied to the objects in the problem. In the example, the user included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions would be that n is an integer, n ≥ 4, and that the induction hypothesis (n! ≥ 2^n) holds for some n. However, the induction hypothesis is part of the proof technique, not an assumption of the problem itself. The problem's actual assumptions are the constraints on n. So maybe the correct assumptions are that n is an integer and n ≥ 4. Because the problem asks to prove n! ≥ 2^n for all n starting from the base case, which is 4. So the problem's assumptions are that n is an integer and n ≥4. The induction part is the method, not an assumption. Therefore, the formatted assumptions should list that n is an integer and n is greater than or equal to 4. The problem is to prove the inequality using induction. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in this case, the base case starts at 4, so the assumptions would be n is integer, n ≥4. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions: n is an integer, n is greater than or equal to 4. The problem is to prove n! ≥2^n by induction. Let me verify that. The user's problem states that the base case is 4, so the problem is for n ≥4. Therefore, the assumptions should include that n is an integer and n ≥4. The problem is to prove the inequality by induction. That seems correct. So the final answer would list those assumptions and the problem statement.",
