    "Content": "Let $f \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a measurable function. I would like to prove the following inequality: $$\\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left\\lvert \\int_0^t f(s, x)\\,ds\\right\\rvert^q\\, dx \\right)^{\\frac{1}{q}} \\le \\int_0^t \\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\lvert f(s, x)\\rvert^q\\,dx\\right)^{\\frac{1}{q}}\\, ds, $$ under the minimal assumption that all integrals make sense and the rightmost term above is finite. The idea was to rewrite the inequality this way $$\\left\\lVert \\int_0^t f(s,\\cdot)\\, ds\\right\\rVert_q \\le \\int_0^t \\lVert f(s, \\cdot) \\rVert_q\\, ds,$$ which looks so obviously true... But I'm afraid of some pitfall here. In fact, we cannot guarantee continuous dependence of $f$ on the first variable, so $\\int_0^t f(s, \\cdot)\\, ds$ is not the usual Riemann integral in a Banach space. What do you think: is this approach leading somewhere or I'd better try another one? (Which one, just in case? :-) ) EDIT: Answer I've found a very satisfactory answer in Hardy-Littlewood-Polya's Inequalities (@Willie Wong: thank you!). I'm glad to expose it here (with slightly different language, in case you ask). Theorem Let $\\Omega_t, \\Omega_x$ be $\\sigma$ -finite measure spaces and $f \\colon \\Omega_t \\times \\Omega_x \\to [0, \\infty]$ be a measurable function. If $1 < p < \\infty$ then $$\\left\\lVert \\int_{\\Omega_t} f(s, \\cdot)\\, ds\\right\\rVert_p \\le \\int_{\\Omega_t}\\lVert f(s, \\cdot) \\rVert_p \\,ds,$$ where $\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_p$ refers to $L^p(\\Omega_x)$ . Lemma Let $\\Omega$ be a $\\sigma$ -finite measure space and $J \\colon \\Omega \\to [0, \\infty]$ a measurable function. If $1 < p < \\infty$ and $F \\ge 0$ then the following statements are equivalent: $\\lVert J \\rVert_p \\le F$ ; $\\forall g \\in L^{p'}(\\Omega), g \\ge 0, \\int_{\\Omega} g^{p'}dx \\le 1$ we have $\\int_{\\Omega}Jg\\, dx \\le F$ . Proof of Theorem Let $J(y)=\\int_{\\Omega_t}f(s, y)\\, ds$ . $J$ is a measurable positive function on $\\Omega_x$ . Take $g \\in L^{p'}(\\Omega_x), g \\ge 0, \\int_{\\Omega_x}g(y)dy \\le 1$ . Then by Fubini's theorem and Hölder's inequality we have $$\\int_{\\Omega_x}J(y)g(y)\\, dy = \\int_{\\Omega_t}ds \\int_{\\Omega_x}f(s, y)g(y)dy\\le \\int_{\\Omega_t}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega_x}f(s, y)^p dy\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\\, ds, $$ that is, $\\int_{\\Omega_x}J(y)g(y)dy\\le \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\lVert f(s, \\cdot) \\rVert_p\\, ds$ and so $\\lVert J \\rVert_p \\le \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\lVert f(s, \\cdot)\\rVert_p\\, ds$ by the lemma.    //// The general principle here is very interesting: if you want to prove an inequality like $\\int J^p\\, dx \\le \\text{something}$ , you can get past that annoying exponent $p$ by proving $\\int Jg\\, dx \\le \\text{something}$ for all suitable $g$ . References Hardy-Littlewood-Polya, Inequalities : my Theorem is their Theorem 202 , my Lemma is their Theorem 191 . EDIT 2020 Let us see how to prove the Lemma. It looks MUCH tougher than it actually is. We don't actually need any functional analysis to prove it, no dual spaces or anything like that. The proof that 1. $\\Rightarrow$ 2. is literally just an immediate application of the inequality of Hölder. The proof that 2. $\\Rightarrow$ 1. is based on the obvious computation $$\n\\lVert J^{p-1}\\rVert_{p'}=\\lVert J\\rVert_p^{p-1}, $$ which motivates us to write $$\n\\lVert J\\rVert_p^p=\\lVert J\\rVert_p^{p-1}\\int J(x)\\frac{J^{p-1}(x)}{\\lVert J^{p-1}\\rVert_{p'}}\\, dx, $$ and now we can apply the assumption 2 to bound the integral, because $\\frac{J^{p-1}(x)}{\\lVert J^{p-1}\\rVert_{p'}}$ has $p'$ norm equal to 1. We conclude $$\n\\lVert J\\rVert_p^p\\le \\lVert J\\rVert_p^{p-1} F, $$ from which 1. immediately follows. $\\Box$ Remark . As stressed by the book Analysis of Lieb and Loss, in the case of $L^p$ spaces the abstract functional analysis is not necessary, and it actually sometimes obscures what is going on. This is a good example of that phenomenon. This edit comes nine years after the original question, one of my first ones. I am still here. Looks like I got hooked for real. :-)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "So, first thing to try is to set $$f(x,t) = \\sum_{j = 1}^N g_j(x) 1_{F_j}(y)$$ for pairwise disjoint $F_j$. For this the inequality is easy to verify. Now we would like to take limits, but the question is: Are the measurable functions pointwise limits of function of the form of $f$? It turns out this is the case as has been shown by Nate Eldredge on a question of mine (I tried to prove the same). Sequence of measurable functions",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question on Math Stack Exchange, the title is \"Infinite dimensional integral inequality\". The user is trying to prove an inequality involving integrals of a measurable function over ℝ. The problem is restated using L^q norms, and they mention concerns about the integral being a Banach space integral due to lack of continuity. They later found a theorem from Hardy-Littlewood-Polya's book, which they explain in detail, including a lemma and proof.\n\nBut for the purpose of formatting the problem as per the example, I need to filter out the extraneous information like the user's thought process, the theorem they found, the lemma, proofs, and edits. The core problem is the inequality they initially wanted to prove.\n\nThe assumptions would include that f is a measurable function from ℝ×ℝ to ℝ, all integrals make sense (i.e., are well-defined and finite where necessary), and the rightmost term (the integral from 0 to t of the L^q norm of f(s,·) ds) is finite. Also, the problem is to prove that the L^q norm of the integral of f over [0,t] is less than or equal to the integral of the L^q norms.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line, one condition per line. The problem statement should be the inequality as presented. I need to check if there are other implicit assumptions, like the exponents (q is presumably ≥1, but the user mentions \"minimal assumptions\" so maybe q isn't specified beyond making integrals sensible and the right-hand side finite). The problem statement in the original question is the inequality, so that's the main focus.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a measurable function from ℝ×ℝ to ℝ.\n2. All integrals in the inequality are well-defined (make sense).\n3. The rightmost term (integral from 0 to t of the L^q norm of f(s,·) ds) is finite.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove the stated inequality. The mention of q being in a certain range (like 1 < q < ∞) might be part of the assumptions, but the original problem states \"under the minimal assumption that all integrals make sense and the rightmost term above is finite.\" So maybe q is part of the problem's context but not an explicit assumption unless specified. Wait, the user's edit mentions Theorem 202 with 1 < p < ∞, but in the original problem, they are using q. Since the problem as posed by the user initially uses q and doesn't specify its range, but in the theorem they found, p is between 1 and infinity. However, the original problem says \"minimal assumptions\", so perhaps q is just such that the integrals make sense. But maybe the user's problem is for q ≥1, but the theorem requires 1 < p < ∞. However, since the user is structuring their problem, perhaps the assumption is that q is such that the integrals are defined. But according to the problem statement, the user says \"under the minimal assumption that all integrals make sense and the rightmost term above is finite.\" So, the assumptions are as given. Therefore, the key points are the measurability of f, the well-definedness of integrals, and finiteness of the right-hand side.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a measurable function from ℝ×ℝ to ℝ,\nAll integrals in the inequality are well-defined,\nThe integral ∫₀ᵗ ‖f(s,·)‖ₖ ds is finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n‖∫₀ᵗ f(s,·) ds‖ₖ ≤ ∫₀ᵗ ‖f(s,·)‖ₖ ds,\nwhere ‖·‖ₖ denotes the Lᵖ norm on ℝ.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user uses q as the exponent. Let me check again. The original inequality is written with q, so the L^q norm. So in the problem statement, it's L^q. The user later in their theorem uses p, but the problem as posed uses q. So the problem should use q. Let me correct that.\n\nThe problem statement in the original question is:\n\nProve the inequality:\n(∫ℝ |∫₀ᵗ f(s,x) ds|^q dx)^(1/q) ≤ ∫₀ᵗ (∫ℝ |f(s,x)|^q dx)^(1/q) ds\n\nSo translating that into the L^q norm notation, the left-hand side is the L^q norm (in x) of the integral over s from 0 to t of f(s,x) ds, and the right-hand side is the integral over s from 0 to t of the L^q norm of f(s,x) in x.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show that the L^q norm of the integral is less than or equal to the integral of the L^q norms. The assumptions are the measurability, the integrals making sense, and the finiteness of the right-hand side.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℝ×ℝ → ℝ is measurable,\nAll integrals in the inequality are well-defined,\nThe integral from 0 to t of ‖f(s,·)‖_q ds is finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n‖∫₀ᵗ f(s,·) ds‖_q ≤ ∫₀ᵗ ‖f(s,·)‖_q ds,\nwhere ‖·‖_q denotes the L^q norm on ℝ.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line. The first line is the measurability, the second line is the well-definedness of all integrals, and the third is the finiteness of the right-hand integral. Each addresses one condition. The problem statement is the inequality as given.",
