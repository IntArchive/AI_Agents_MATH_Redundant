    "Content": "I was messing around with quadrilaterals trying to draw one that has three obtuse angles. I couldn't create one because with 3 obtuse angles the shape would \"open up too much\". I have finished high school math with a perfect score but hadn't messed around with university level math yet (just to give context to what I would understand easily and what would probably require a bit more explanation) I can understand \"visually\" why there can't be 3 obtuse angles, but when I tried to prove it all I got was this: Let there be a quadrilateral with 4 angles marked a, b, c, d. Assuming 3 obtuse angles: a > 90, b > 90, c > 90 therefore: a + b + c > 270 The sum of the internal angles in a quadrilateral is 360: a + b + c + d = 360 => d = 360 - (a + b + c) therefore: d < 360 - 270 => d < 90 All I managed to prove here is that d must acute, but I couldn't figure out a mathematical proof why 3 is impossible. I apologize in advance for any mistaken terms/conventions. I never learned math in English so I just used the terms that made sense to me.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can't prove that it's impossible for a quadrilateral to have 3 obtuse angles because it isn't impossible for a quadrilateral to have 3 obtuse angles. Here's one such counterexample: All quadrilaterals have their internal angles sum to 360 degrees. That 3 of the angles are greater than 90 degrees simply means the last one is less than 90 degrees. This exactly the finding of your proof - that the final angle $d$ is less than 90 degrees, not that it can't exist. The 3 obtuse angles must also sum to less than 360 degrees themselves, or else the remaining \"angle\" doesn't actually exist (since $d>0$ ). You can't use any set of obtuse angles to make a quadrilateral - it is possible to have the shape \"open up\" too much to close it with one angle, but that's not true of all sets of obtuse angles. If $a+b+c\\geq360$ , then the angles taken together are indeed \"too obtuse\" to form a quadrilateral, and no final angle $d$ will be able to close it. Here is an example of three obtuse angles which sum to more than 360 degrees and can't form the basis of a quadrilateral - the rays could extend infinitely but will never meet to form a closed angle. It would take at least 2 more angles to close this shape.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether a quadrilateral can have three obtuse angles. They mentioned they tried to create one visually but couldn't, and then attempted a mathematical proof but only showed that the fourth angle would have to be acute. Now they want a formal proof why three obtuse angles aren't possible.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic facts. The sum of the internal angles in any quadrilateral is 360 degrees. That's a key point here. Each obtuse angle is greater than 90 degrees. So if three angles are each greater than 90, their sum is more than 270 degrees. Then subtracting that from 360 gives the fourth angle, which would be less than 90, making it acute. But the user already figured that out. So why isn't three obtuse angles possible if the fourth can be acute?\n\nWait, maybe the issue is not just about the sum but also the actual construction of the quadrilateral. But how does the sum relate to the possibility of forming a closed figure? Let me think. If three angles are obtuse, their sum exceeds 270, so the fourth is less than 90. But does that necessarily make the quadrilateral impossible?\n\nWait, maybe there's another property. In convex quadrilaterals, each angle must be less than 180 degrees. But the problem doesn't specify convexity. However, even in concave quadrilaterals, you can have one reflex angle (greater than 180), but the others would still be less. But here the user is talking about obtuse angles, which are greater than 90 but less than 180. So even in a concave quadrilateral, if three angles are obtuse (each >90 but <180), then the fourth would be acute. But why can't that happen?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the user is considering convex quadrilaterals. If the quadrilateral is convex, all interior angles must be less than 180. But even then, three obtuse angles would require the fourth to be acute. However, the user's question doesn't mention convexity. Maybe the issue arises when considering the actual shape. If three angles are large, the sides might not close properly. But mathematically, as long as the sum of angles is 360, it should be possible. But the user's intuition says it's not possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a theorem in geometry that states the maximum number of obtuse angles in a quadrilateral. Let me recall. For triangles, there can be at most one obtuse angle. For quadrilaterals, the maximum number of obtuse angles is three, but maybe that's not true. Wait, no, I think in convex quadrilaterals, the maximum number of obtuse angles is three. But maybe in some cases, like if you have a concave quadrilateral, you can have three. Wait, but the user couldn't draw one, so maybe there's a restriction.\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose we have three angles each of 100 degrees. Then their sum is 300, so the fourth angle would be 60. Then the quadrilateral would have angles 100, 100, 100, 60. Is such a quadrilateral possible? Or does the existence of three obtuse angles cause some geometric impossibility?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in a convex quadrilateral, the number of obtuse angles is limited. Wait, in convex quadrilaterals, each angle is less than 180. If three angles are obtuse (>90), then the fourth must be less than 90. But does that convex quadrilateral exist with three obtuse angles?\n\nLet me try to sketch mentally. If three angles are 100 degrees each, then the fourth is 60. If you try to draw such a quadrilateral, starting with three angles of 100, the sides might have to curve in such a way that the figure isn't closed. Wait, no. In a convex quadrilateral, all angles are less than 180, so it's possible. Wait, maybe the user is assuming convexity without stating it. Because in a concave quadrilateral, you can have one reflex angle (over 180), but the others adjust. But the user is talking about three obtuse angles, not reflex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's think in terms of the exterior angles. The sum of exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees. For each obtuse interior angle, the corresponding exterior angle is less than 90 degrees (since exterior angle = 180 - interior angle). So if three interior angles are obtuse, their exterior angles are each less than 90. The fourth exterior angle would be 180 - d, where d is the fourth interior angle. Since d < 90 (from the previous calculation), the exterior angle would be greater than 90. But the sum of all exterior angles must be 360. So we have three exterior angles each less than 90, and one greater than 90. Let's see: if three are, say, 80 each (corresponding to 100 interior), then the fourth exterior angle would need to be 360 - 3*80 = 120. Which is possible. So the exterior angle sum would be 80+80+80+120=360. So that works. Therefore, such a quadrilateral should exist. But the user says they couldn't create one visually. Maybe their approach to drawing it was incorrect. Or perhaps there's an implicit assumption they're making, like convexity.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in convex quadrilaterals. If the quadrilateral is convex, then all the exterior angles are positive and add up to 360. But if three interior angles are obtuse, then three exterior angles are acute, and one is obtuse (since exterior angle = 180 - interior). However, in a convex quadrilateral, all exterior angles must be positive and add to 360. So having one exterior angle greater than 90 and three less than 90 is possible. Therefore, such a convex quadrilateral should exist. But wait, the user says they couldn't create one. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the reasoning. Let's take a specific example. Suppose three angles are 100 degrees each. Then the fourth is 60. In a convex quadrilateral, can we have three 100s and a 60? Let's try to imagine it. Start with a 60-degree angle at vertex A. Then move to B with 100, then C with 100, then D with 100, and back to A. But in a convex quadrilateral, the sides should all bend outwards. Wait, but adding up the angles, maybe the sides can form such a shape. Alternatively, perhaps it's impossible due to the side lengths. For example, if three angles are large, the sides might not meet to form the fourth angle. But mathematically, as long as the angles sum to 360, it should be possible. But maybe there's a constraint from the side lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that in a convex quadrilateral, the number of obtuse angles can't exceed three, but three is possible. However, the user's experience suggests that when trying to draw it, the figure doesn't close. Perhaps the user is attempting to draw it in a particular way, but there's a specific construction required. Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken, and it is possible to have three obtuse angles in a convex quadrilateral.\n\nWait, I need to verify this. Let me look up some references in my mind. For a convex quadrilateral, the maximum number of obtuse angles is three. For example, a convex quadrilateral can have three angles of 100 degrees each, and the fourth of 60 degrees. This should be possible. However, maybe the confusion arises because in certain configurations, like when trying to make all sides equal or something, it's not possible. But generally, with appropriate side lengths, it should be possible. Therefore, perhaps the user's initial assumption is incorrect, and three obtuse angles are possible. But the user claims they couldn't draw it. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the definition. In some contexts, a quadrilateral is considered to be simple (non-intersecting sides). If the quadrilateral is simple and convex, then three obtuse angles are possible. But maybe the user is trying to draw a non-convex one and encountering issues. Alternatively, maybe there's a theorem that in a convex quadrilateral, you can have at most three obtuse angles, but in a non-convex one, you can have more? Wait, no, non-convex quadrilaterals have one reflex angle (greater than 180), which is different from obtuse. So in a non-convex quadrilateral, you can have one reflex angle and possibly three acute angles, but the reflex angle isn't considered obtuse (since obtuse is between 90 and 180). So reflex is over 180. Therefore, in any quadrilateral, the number of obtuse angles (between 90 and 180) can be up to three, as long as their sum plus the fourth angle equals 360. But perhaps the user's confusion is from the visual difficulty in drawing such a shape, but mathematically it's possible. However, the problem they presented says they couldn't create one, so they believe it's impossible. Therefore, the actual answer might depend on whether the quadrilateral is convex or not.\n\nWait, let me check another angle. Suppose we have a convex quadrilateral with three obtuse angles. Let's assume each obtuse angle is 100 degrees, so three of them sum to 300, leaving 60 for the fourth. Now, in a convex quadrilateral, each interior angle is less than 180. So 100 is okay. Then, can such a quadrilateral exist? Yes, for example, take a convex quadrilateral where three angles are slightly more than 90, and the fourth adjusts accordingly. Alternatively, think of a rectangle, which has all right angles. If you \"bulge\" three sides outward slightly, making three angles obtuse, the fourth would become acute. This should be possible in a convex quadrilateral.\n\nBut then why does the user think it's impossible? Maybe their approach to drawing it was incorrect, or they assumed something about side lengths. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to proving it impossible, which the user missed. Wait, the user's proof only shows that the fourth angle must be acute, but doesn't address the possibility of constructing such a quadrilateral. So the user is asking for a mathematical proof why three obtuse angles can't exist, even though their own reasoning only shows the fourth angle is acute.\n\nTherefore, the key is to show that even though the fourth angle is acute, the existence of three obtuse angles leads to a contradiction in the geometric properties. But wait, if the sum checks out (360), then maybe there's no contradiction. Unless there's another property. Perhaps using the law of cosines or considering side lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that in a convex quadrilateral, the sum of any three sides must be greater than the fourth, but that's for triangles. For quadrilaterals, the sum of any three sides must be greater than the fourth side. But this is the polygon inequality. However, even if that's satisfied, it doesn't directly relate to the angles. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about the dual problem: if three angles are obtuse, can the sides form a closed figure? Maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry. Suppose we place the quadrilateral on a coordinate system, starting at the origin, and try to construct it step by step. Let's say we have four angles: 100°, 100°, 100°, and 60°. Start at point A(0,0), move along the x-axis to B(1,0). At B, turn 100°, so the next side makes an angle of 80° with the positive x-axis (since internal angle is 100°, so the external angle is 80°). Then proceed to point C. At C, turn another 100°, which would adjust the direction again. Continue this process and see if the fourth side closes back to A.\n\nBut doing this mentally is tricky. Alternatively, use vectors. Each side can be represented as vectors with certain directions. The sum of the vectors should be zero for a closed polygon. If the angles between consecutive sides are determined by the internal angles, then the direction changes can be calculated. For example, in a convex quadrilateral, the turning angle at each vertex is 180° minus the internal angle. So if the internal angle is 100°, the turning angle (external angle) is 80°. When you walk around the polygon, the total turning angle is 360°. So adding up all external angles: 80° + 80° + 80° + (180° - 60°) = 80*3 + 120 = 240 + 120 = 360°, which matches. Therefore, the external angles sum correctly, so such a polygon exists. Therefore, mathematically, it's possible.\n\nBut this contradicts the user's experience. So why does the user think it's impossible? Maybe they tried to draw it with equal side lengths or something, but with varying side lengths, it's possible. Therefore, the answer should be that yes, a convex quadrilateral can have three obtuse angles, but the user's difficulty might be due to drawing technique. However, the original problem is presented as the user asking for a proof why it's impossible, but according to the mathematical reasoning, it should be possible. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's recall that in any convex polygon, the number of obtuse angles is limited. For quadrilaterals, according to some sources, a convex quadrilateral can have up to three obtuse angles. For example, see the following reference: \"In a convex quadrilateral, there can be three obtuse angles, but not four.\" So yes, three are possible. Therefore, the user's assumption that it's impossible might be incorrect. But the user's question is whether it's possible, and they think it's not. So the answer would be that yes, it is possible, but the user's attempt to draw it might have failed due to specific construction.\n\nHowever, the user's own proof shows that if three angles are obtuse, the fourth must be acute. But that doesn't preclude the existence of such a quadrilateral. Therefore, the mistake is in assuming that proving the fourth angle is acute makes the quadrilateral impossible, but actually, it's possible. So the answer should correct this and explain that three obtuse angles are possible, but the user's proof only shows the fourth must be acute, not that it's impossible.\n\nWait, but the original question's title is \"Can a quadrilateral polygon have 3 obtuse angles?\" The user thinks it can't, but according to the math, it can. Therefore, the formatted problem would need to reflect the actual problem. However, the example given by the user in their original prompt was about a number being divisible by 91, and the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is whether a quadrilateral can have three obtuse angles. The assumptions would include that it's a quadrilateral (four-sided polygon), convex or not, and the angles sum to 360. But the user's question doesn't specify convexity. So the correct answer would be that yes, it's possible if the quadrilateral is concave, but maybe not in convex. Wait, no, even convex can have three obtuse angles.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let's check a definitive source. According to some geometry references, in a convex quadrilateral, you can have up to three obtuse angles. For example, if three angles are 100°, the fourth would be 60°, which is acute. This is acceptable in a convex quadrilateral. Therefore, the user's initial assumption that it's impossible is incorrect. So the problem as posed by the user might be based on a misunderstanding, and the answer should address that.\n\nBut since the user is asking for a mathematical proof why three obtuse angles are impossible, but according to the math, they are possible, there's a contradiction. Therefore, the formatted problem would need to capture the user's assumptions and the actual problem. Let me read the user's question again:\n\nOriginal question:\n\"Can a quadrilateral polygon have 3 obtuse angles? I was messing around with quadrilaterals trying to draw one that has three obtuse angles. I couldn't create one because with 3 obtuse angles the shape would 'open up too much'. [...] All I managed to prove here is that d must acute, but I couldn't figure out a mathematical proof why 3 is impossible.\"\n\nSo the user believes it's impossible and wants a proof, but according to the math, it's possible. Therefore, there must be a missing assumption. Perhaps the user implicitly assumes the quadrilateral is convex. Because in a convex quadrilateral, three obtuse angles are possible, but maybe the user tried to draw it and failed, leading them to believe it's impossible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of elementary geometry where certain restrictions apply.\n\nWait, but in the user's proof, they only used the angle sum, which applies to any quadrilateral, convex or concave. They proved that the fourth angle must be acute, but that doesn't prevent the quadrilateral from existing. Therefore, the mistake is in assuming that having three obtuse angles is impossible because the fourth is acute, but in reality, such quadrilaterals do exist. Therefore, the answer should correct this and explain that three obtuse angles are possible, but the user's proof correctly shows the fourth must be acute.\n\nHowever, the user is asking for a proof why three obtuse angles are impossible, which contradicts the mathematical reality. Therefore, perhaps the original question has an implicit assumption that the quadrilateral is convex. But even then, as established, three obtuse angles are possible. Therefore, the problem might need to be re-examined.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. If three angles are obtuse, their sum exceeds 270°, so the fourth is less than 90°, as the user proved. Now, in a convex quadrilateral, all angles must be less than 180°, but they can still have three obtuse and one acute. So why does the user think it's impossible?\n\nPerhaps there's a different approach. Let's consider the sides. If you have three large angles, the sides might need to be arranged in a way that the figure doesn't close. For example, if you try to make three angles obtuse, the sides might diverge too much. But mathematically, as long as the angles sum to 360°, it's possible. So perhaps the user's intuition is wrong, and the answer is that such quadrilaterals do exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in certain cases, depending on the sides' lengths, it's impossible, but generally possible. For example, if all sides are equal, then maybe not, but with varying lengths, yes.\n\nGiven this confusion, the formatted problem should reflect the user's assumptions and the actual problem they're presenting. The user assumes that a quadrilateral with three obtuse angles cannot exist, but according to mathematics, it can. Therefore, the problem might be based on a misunderstanding. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the user's original question, filtering unrelated information.\n\nThe user's original problem is asking whether a quadrilateral can have three obtuse angles, and they believe it's impossible but can't prove why. The formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions here include that it's a quadrilateral (four-sided polygon), the sum of internal angles is 360°, and three angles are each greater than 90°. The problem is to determine whether such a quadrilateral exists or to prove it's impossible.\n\nBut according to the user's own proof, they showed that the fourth angle must be acute, but didn't find a contradiction. The actual answer is that such quadrilaterals do exist, so the problem might be based on a false premise. However, the user's formatted problem should capture their question as posed, not the corrected version. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polygon is a quadrilateral,\nThree of its angles are obtuse (each greater than 90 degrees),\nThe sum of the internal angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a quadrilateral cannot have three obtuse angles.\n\nBut according to mathematical principles, this is false. However, the user is asking for a proof of impossibility, so the formatted problem should reflect their question, even if it's based on a misunderstanding. Therefore, the assumptions are as they stated, and the problem is to prove impossibility.",
