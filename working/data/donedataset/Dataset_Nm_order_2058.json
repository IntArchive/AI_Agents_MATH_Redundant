    "Content": "A friend of mine showed me the following problem: Let $\\cal E$ be an ellipse whose semi major axis has length $a$ and semi minor axis has length $b$. Let $\\ell_1, \\ell_2$ be two parallel lines tangent to $\\cal E$. Let $\\cal C$ be the circle tangent to $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$, and $\\cal E$. Prove that the distance between the centers of $\\cal C$ and $\\cal E$ is equal to $a+b$. So far I managed to prove that if we draw the tangent line $k_1$ through $\\cal E \\cap \\cal C$ and the tangent $k_2$ to $\\cal E$ parallel to $k_1$ then the circle tangent to $k_1, k_2, \\ell_1$ is tangent to $\\cal E$ as well. I'm stuck. I'd like to see some proofs, preferably non-analytic ones.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I have a roadmap for a simple solution through analytic geometry / trigonometry: Let us consider an ellipse $\\mathcal{E}$ with equation $\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$, i.e. $(x,y)=(a\\cos\\theta,b\\sin\\theta)$; Let us consider a generic point $P\\in\\mathcal{E}$, i.e. some $\\theta\\in[0,2\\pi)$; Let us compute the slope of the tangent $\\tau_{P}$ through $P$ and consider that the parallel tangent is $\\tau_{-P}$, since in a conic the midpoints of parallel chords are aligned along a line through the center of the conic; Let $R_\\theta$ be half the distance between $\\tau_P$ and $\\tau_{-P}$ and $\\ell_\\theta$ the line through the original parallel to $\\tau_P$. Let $C_\\theta$ be an intersection between $\\ell_\\theta$ and the circle $x^2+y^2=(a+b)^2$; In order to check that $\\mathcal{E}$ and the circle with radius $R_\\theta$ centered at $C_\\theta$ are tangent it is enough to check that a discriminant equals zero. Here there are some ideas for a purely Euclidean solution: Let $Q=\\mathcal{C}\\cap\\mathcal{E}$. First Claim : the parallelogram having sides $\\tau_P,\\tau_{-P},\\tau_Q,\\tau_{-Q}$ has its vertices on a fixed ellipse $\\mathcal{E}'$, having the same foci as $\\mathcal{E}$; Let $U,V$ the vertices of the previous parallelogram on $\\tau_Q$. Second Claim : $C_\\theta U$ and $C_\\theta V$ are orthogonal tangents to $\\mathcal{E}'$, so $C_\\theta$ lies on the orthoptic of $\\mathcal{E}'$ and has a constant distance from $O$. Indeed, the first claim follows from Poncelet's porism and the second claim is just a matter of angle chasing. Here it comes an animation, too:",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user provided a question from Math Stack Exchange about a circle tangent to an ellipse and two parallel lines, and they want the distance between the centers to be a+b. The original question mentions some semi-axes lengths a and b for the ellipse. The user also mentioned some progress with tangent lines but is stuck now.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this problem according to the specified format. The key is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states: Let E be an ellipse with semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b. Two parallel lines l1 and l2 are tangent to E. There's a circle C tangent to l1, l2, and E. We need to prove the distance between the centers of C and E is a + b.\n\nAssumptions would include the properties of the ellipse, the parallel tangent lines, and the circle's tangency conditions. Each assumption should be a single line. Let's list them:\n\n1. The ellipse E has a semi-major axis of length a.\n2. The ellipse E has a semi-minor axis of length b.\n3. Lines l1 and l2 are parallel.\n4. Line l1 is tangent to ellipse E.\n5. Line l2 is tangent to ellipse E.\n6. Circle C is tangent to line l1.\n7. Circle C is tangent to line l2.\n8. Circle C is tangent to ellipse E.\n\nThe problem is to prove the distance between the centers of C and E is a + b.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't mention the direction or position of the lines l1 and l2. Are they any pair of parallel tangents to the ellipse? Or are they specific, like the ones such that the circle is squeezed between them and the ellipse? The problem statement just says two parallel lines tangent to E, and the circle is tangent to those lines and the ellipse. So the assumptions should capture all necessary conditions given.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is one condition on one object. For example, the ellipse's axes are two separate assumptions. The lines being parallel is one assumption, and each line's tangency to the ellipse is separate. Similarly, the circle's tangency to each line and the ellipse are separate.\n\nSo the formatted assumptions would be as above. The problem statement is to prove the distance between centers is a + b. The user also mentions preferring non-analytic proofs, but that's part of the original problem's request, not the assumptions. So the formatted problem should capture the assumptions and the problem statement correctly.",
