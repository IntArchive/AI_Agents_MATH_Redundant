    "Content": "I need to prove that the sequence $a_n=1+\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{3^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n^2}$ converges. I do not have to find the limit. I have tried to prove it by proving that the sequence is monotone and bounded, but I am having some trouble: Monotonic: The sequence seems to be monotone and increasing. This can be proved by induction: Claim that $a_n\\leq a_{n+1}$\n$$a_1=1\\leq 1+\\frac{1}{2^2}=a_2$$ Need to show that $a_{n+1}\\leq a_{n+2}$\n$$a_{n+1}=1+\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{3^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n^2}+\\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}\\leq 1+\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{3^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n^2}+\\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}+\\frac{1}{(n+2)^2}=a_{n+2}$$ \nThus the sequence is monotone and increasing. Boundedness: Since the sequence is increasing it is bounded below by $a_1=1$.\nUpper bound is where I am having trouble. All the examples I have dealt with in class have to do with decreasing functions, but I don't know what my thinking process should be to find an upper bound. Can anyone enlighten me as to how I should approach this, and can anyone confirm my work thus far? Also, although I prove this using monotonicity and boundedness, could I have approached this by showing the sequence was a Cauchy sequence? Thanks so much in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your work looks good so far. Here is a hint :\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n^2} \\le \\frac{1}{n(n-1)} = \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n}\n$$ To elaborate, apply the hint to get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\frac{1}{4^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\le \\left(\\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + \\cdots + \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)\n$$ Notice that we had to omit the term $1$ because the inequality in the hint is only applicable when $n > 1$. No problem; we will add it later. Also notice that all terms on the right-hand side cancel out except for the first and last one. Thus:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\frac{1}{4^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\le 1 - \\frac{1}{n}\n$$ Add $1$ to both sides to get:\n$$\na_n \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{n} \\le 2\n$$ It follows that $a_n$ is bounded from above and hence convergent. It is worth noting that canceling behavior we saw here is called telescoping . Check out the wikipedia article for more examples.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at the problem the user provided. The task is to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that the sequence \\( a_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\) converges. The user mentions they want to use the Monotone Convergence Theorem by showing the sequence is monotonic and bounded. They've already worked out the monotonicity part but are stuck on finding an upper bound.\n\nNow, according to the example given, the Assumptions section should list each condition applied to one object, line by line. In the example, assumptions were about \\( n \\) being an integer and divisible by 7. However, looking at the problem here, the sequence \\( a_n \\) is defined for all positive integers \\( n \\), and the user is trying to prove convergence. \n\nSo, what assumptions are inherent here? The sequence is defined as the sum of reciprocals of squares up to \\( n \\). The problem doesn't state any restrictions on \\( n \\), but since it's a sequence, \\( n \\) is a positive integer. Also, the approach uses the Monotone Convergence Theorem, which requires the sequence to be monotonic and bounded. The user has already established monotonicity (increasing), so the key assumption here is that \\( a_n \\) is increasing. Additionally, to apply the theorem, the sequence must be bounded above.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't explicitly state these as given conditions; the user is trying to verify them. However, the example given in the initial prompt includes assumptions that might not be explicitly stated in the original problem but are derived from context. For instance, in the example, the assumption that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7 was part of the problem's conditions, even though the original problem just said \"for every integer \\( n \\)\". Wait, no, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer \\( n \\), but the formatted problem included an assumption that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original example problem says: Prove that for every integer \\( n \\), the number \\( A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) \\) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem then lists assumptions: \\( n \\) is an integer, \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer \\( n \\)\", so there shouldn't be an assumption that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7. This might be an error in the example. Therefore, maybe the user's example is flawed, but we have to follow the instruction regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, there was a misinterpretation. Maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption that \\( n \\) is divisible by 7, but the user restructured it. Hmm, this is confusing. But moving forward, the task is to extract assumptions from the given problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about proving convergence of the sequence \\( a_n \\). The problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions on \\( n \\), but since it's a sequence, \\( n \\) is a positive integer. The user is using the Monotone Convergence Theorem, which requires the sequence to be monotonic and bounded. The user has shown monotonicity (increasing), so perhaps the assumptions should include that the sequence is increasing. However, the problem is to prove convergence, which inherently requires establishing these properties, so maybe the assumptions are not part of the problem's given conditions but rather the approach. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example given by the user includes in the assumptions things that are part of the problem's conditions. For instance, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer \\( n \\)\", which is an assumption, and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\". Then there's another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That can't be right. Unless there was a mistake in the example. Maybe the user intended that the original problem had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in reality, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption of \"n is divisible by 7\" is incorrect. This suggests that maybe the example is not accurate, but we need to follow the user's structure regardless.\n\nTherefore, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. \\( a_n \\) is defined as the sum \\( 1 + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\).\n2. \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n3. The sequence \\( a_n \\) is increasing.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement doesn't explicitly state these as assumptions; they are inherent in the definition. The user is asking to prove convergence, so the assumptions are the properties needed to apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), so perhaps here the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( a_n \\) is a sequence defined for all positive integers \\( n \\).\n- The sequence \\( a_n \\) is increasing.\n\nBut the problem is to prove convergence, which requires showing it's bounded and monotonic. The user has already shown monotonicity, so maybe the assumption here is that the sequence is increasing, but that's part of the proof, not an assumption. Wait, the user is asking for help to prove convergence by showing it's bounded and monotonic. The problem doesn't state any assumptions, just the definition of \\( a_n \\).\n\nGiven the example, perhaps the assumptions should include the definition of \\( a_n \\), and that \\( n \\) is a positive integer. But the example included specific conditions on \\( n \\), so here, the key assumption is that \\( a_n \\) is defined as the sum of reciprocals of squares up to \\( n \\), and \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, structuring as per the example:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( a_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\)\n- \\( n \\) is a positive integer\n- The sequence \\( a_n \\) is increasing\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence \\( a_n \\) converges.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"the sequence \\( a_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\) converges.\" The user has already shown that it's monotonic (increasing) and is asking for help with boundedness. However, in terms of assumptions, the problem itself doesn't state that the sequence is increasing; the user proved that. So perhaps the assumptions should not include that it's increasing, as that's part of the proof. The example had assumptions that were given in the problem. So in this case, the original problem's assumptions are just the definition of \\( a_n \\) and \\( n \\) being a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( a_n \\) is defined as \\( 1 + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\)\n- \\( n \\) is a positive integer\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence \\( a_n \\) converges.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included conditions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which were part of the problem's original statement. In the current problem, the original statement is just the definition of \\( a_n \\) and the requirement to prove convergence. The user's own attempt mentions proving monotonicity and boundedness, but those are steps in the proof, not assumptions.\n\nTherefore, following the example's approach, the assumptions would be the basic definitions and conditions given in the problem. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( a_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\)\n- \\( n \\) is a positive integer\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence \\( a_n \\) converges.\n\nHowever, the example had an extra assumption that wasn't explicitly stated in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake. To avoid that, here we should only list what's given. The problem defines \\( a_n \\) as the sum up to \\( 1/n^2 \\), and \\( n \\) is a positive integer because it's a sequence. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as above.",
