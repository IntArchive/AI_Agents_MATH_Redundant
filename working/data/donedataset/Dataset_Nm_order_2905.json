    "Content": "Let $G$ is an abelian infinte group such that for all nontrivial subgroups $H$ $$\\forall H\\leq G, \\left|\\frac{G}{H}\\right|<\\infty$$ Prove that $G\\cong\\mathbb Z$. What I have done: Clearly, it is enough to show that $G$ is a cyclic group. Moreover, I see as $G/H$ is a finite group for all subgroups $H$, then $G$ cannot have any elements with the finite order. This means to me that if $H \\leq G$ and $H$ is cyclic then $H$ cannot be finite. Help your friend for the rest. Thanks. :)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Show that such a group must be finitely generated. Using the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, you have that $G \\simeq \\mathbb{Z}^r \\times \\mathbb{Z} / n_1 \\mathbb{Z} \\times ... \\times \\mathbb{Z} / n_k \\mathbb{Z}$ where $n_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. There is an isomorphic copy of each factor of the direct product in $G$. Quotienting $G$ by $\\mathbb{Z}^s$ for various $1 \\leq s \\leq r$ and the $\\mathbb{Z} / n_i \\mathbb{Z}$, you see that $r = 1$ ($r \\geq 1$ for the group to be infinite and $r \\leq 1$ for the finite quotient property) and $k = 0$ (for the finite quotient property).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. Let me first understand the original problem and the user's example to make sure I follow the correct format.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that a certain abelian infinite group G, which has the property that all nontrivial subgroups H result in G/H being finite, is isomorphic to the integers Z. The user's example shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: G is an abelian infinite group. For all nontrivial subgroups H of G, the quotient group G/H is finite. The goal is to prove G is isomorphic to Z.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. G is an abelian group.\n2. G is infinite.\n3. For every nontrivial subgroup H of G (i.e., H ≤ G and H ≠ {e}), the order of G/H is finite.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the Assumption section. The problem statement is to prove G ≅ Z.\n\nWait, the user's example had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So in this case, each property about G needs to be listed. Let me check if there's more. The original problem mentions that G is abelian, infinite, and that all nontrivial subgroups have finite index. So three assumptions. The problem is to show isomorphism to Z.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nG is an abelian group,\nG is an infinite group,\nFor every nontrivial subgroup H of G, the quotient group G/H is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is isomorphic to ℤ.\n\nLet me check the user's example again. The original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted version split into assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, the assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions given. The example shows that assumptions are each condition, even if overlapping. But in the original problem here, the conditions are all given in the problem statement. So I need to parse the original problem's conditions into separate assumptions.\n\nSo the problem states G is abelian, infinite, and every nontrivial subgroup H has G/H finite. So three separate assumptions. Then the problem is to show G ≅ ℤ.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is an abelian group,\nG is an infinite group,\nFor every nontrivial subgroup H of G, the quotient group G/H has finite order.\n\nProblem: Prove that G is isomorphic to ℤ.\n\nI need to check if \"quotient group G/H has finite order\" is the same as \"|G/H| < ∞\", which is in the original question. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother check: The user's example had the problem statement in the formatted version. The original question had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", and the formatted problem restated that. So here, the problem is \"Prove that G ≅ ℤ\".\n\nI think that's correct. Let me ensure that all the necessary assumptions are listed and that nothing is missed. The original problem mentions G is abelian, infinite, and for all nontrivial H, G/H is finite. These are all the assumptions given. The problem is to show isomorphism to ℤ. So this should be correctly formatted as per the example.",
