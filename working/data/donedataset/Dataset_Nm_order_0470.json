    "Content": "I came across the following problem, known as Knuth's Series which originally was an American Mathematical Monthly problem. Prove that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{n^n}{n!e^n}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}}\\right)=-\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{\\zeta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}.$$ It seems interesting. We are trying to compute a particular sum of the error term in Stirlings approximation.  The immediate simple approaches don't seem to work. Attempt: Why $\\zeta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$: By partial summation we know that $$\\sum_{n=1}^M \\frac{1}{n^s}= \\frac{M^{1-s}}{1-s}+\\zeta(s)+O\\left(M^{-s}\\right)$$ for $s>0$, $s\\neq 1$.  This tells us where the $\\frac{\\zeta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ comes from since $$\\sum_{n=1}^M \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2M}{\\pi}}+\\frac{\\zeta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}+o(1).$$ Now all that remains is to prove that $$\\sum_{n=1}^M  \\frac{n^n}{n!e^n}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2M}{\\pi}} -\\frac{2}{3}+o(1).$$ I am kinda stuck here, as this series seems strange to deal with. \nThanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a series of hints to summarise the approach that appeared in the American Math Monthly. I have divided them by horizontal bars so hopefully it can ensure you only read one at a time. Unfortunately, this particular solution does not appear to be very general. Prove the following separately first: \n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\biggl( \\frac{k^k}{k!e^k} - \\frac{ (1/2)_{k-1} }{\\sqrt{2} (k-1)!} \\biggr) = \\frac{-2}{3} $$ $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\biggl( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi k}} - \\frac{ (1/2)_{k-1} }{\\sqrt{2} (k-1)!} \\biggr) = \\frac{ \\zeta (1/2) }{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} $$ where the rising factorial is defined: $ (a)_0 = 1 \\mbox{  and  } (a)_m = a(a+1)(a+2) \\cdots (a+m-1) $ Abel's theorem comes in handy: If $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k $ converges, then $$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k = \\lim_{x\\to 1^{-} } \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k x^k $$ Some power series (both for $ |z| < 1 $) : $$ \\mathrm{W}(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k^{k-1} z^k}{k!e^k} $$ $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{ (1/2)_{k-1} }{(k-1)!} z^{k-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z}} $$ where $\\mathrm{W}(z) $ satisfies $ \\mathrm{W} \\exp(-\\mathrm{W}) = z/e $ (See Lambert W Function ), and the second series comes from Newton's Binomial Expansion.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question: The task is to prove that the given infinite sum equals a specific expression involving the Riemann zeta function at 1/2. The user mentions that it's related to Stirling's approximation error terms. The problem involves an infinite series, so the main assumptions would relate to the convergence of the series and properties of the terms involved.\n\nFirst, the series is from n=1 to infinity. Each term in the series is the difference between two expressions: n^n/(n! e^n) and 1/sqrt(2πn). So the assumptions should cover the definitions of these terms. Also, since Stirling's approximation is used, which approximates n! as sqrt(2πn)(n/e)^n, the error term here is the difference between the exact term n^n/(n! e^n) and the approximation 1/sqrt(2πn).\n\nThe problem mentions partial summation and relates the sum of 1/n^s to the zeta function. However, the key assumptions for the problem itself would be about the convergence of the series and the validity of using partial summation or other methods to evaluate the sum. But since the problem is to prove the equality, the main assumptions are about the terms in the series and their properties.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about an infinite series, so maybe the assumptions are that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1), and each term is defined as given. However, perhaps the key assumptions are that the series converges and that Stirling's approximation applies for each term. But I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ [n^n/(n! e^n) - 1/√(2πn)] converges,\nStirling's approximation applies to n! as n → ∞,\nThe Riemann zeta function ζ(1/2) is defined.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem itself doesn't state these assumptions; the user is just supposed to extract explicit assumptions from the problem statement. The original problem says \"Prove that the sum equals...\", so the assumptions would be the conditions under which the sum is evaluated. The problem might not explicitly state the convergence, but since the sum is given, we can assume that the series converges. However, in the example provided, the user included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that wasn't in the original. Wait, no. Wait, looking back: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but that's incorrect because the original problem didn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Wait, this might be an error. Wait, the user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is flawed. Therefore, maybe the user wants me to extract assumptions that are implicit in the problem. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong, but I should follow the user's instruction based on their example.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but I should proceed as per their instruction. However, in the current problem, the user's original question is about the series sum from n=1 to infinity. The assumptions here might be:\n\n- Each term in the series is defined as [n^n/(n! e^n) - 1/√(2πn)].\n- The series converges.\n- The Riemann zeta function at 1/2 is involved.\n\nBut according to the example, perhaps the assumptions should list the properties of the objects involved. For the problem at hand, the key objects are the terms in the series, the summation from n=1 to infinity, and the zeta function. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ [n^n/(n! e^n) - 1/√(2πn)] converges,\nStirling's approximation n! ~ sqrt(2πn)(n/e)^n holds as n approaches infinity,\nThe Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is analytic at s=1/2.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't explicitly mention Stirling's approximation, but the user's attempt refers to it. However, the problem statement says \"the error term in Stirling's approximation\", so that's part of the problem's context. Therefore, the assumptions would be that Stirling's approximation is valid here, and that the series converges. However, the problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions are the conditions under which the equality holds. Since the problem is presented as is, maybe the only explicit assumption is that n runs over positive integers. But in the example, they listed assumptions from the problem's given conditions.\n\nWait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that's not correct because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, but I should follow the structure. Alternatively, perhaps in the example, the problem was miswritten, but the user intended to include additional constraints.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem statement is to prove the given infinite sum equals the expression with zeta(1/2). The user mentions that partial summation is used. However, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1).\n- The series converges.\n- Stirling's approximation is applicable for n! as n approaches infinity.\n- The partial summation formula can be applied here.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nStirling's approximation applies to n! as n approaches infinity,\nThe Riemann zeta function ζ(1/2) is defined,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ [n^n/(n! e^n) - 1/√(2πn)] converges.\n\nBut the problem statement itself doesn't explicitly mention convergence; it's part of what needs to be proven. However, since the sum is written as an infinite series, it's implied that it converges. But maybe that's part of what needs to be shown. However, the problem says \"Prove that the sum equals...\", so the equality assumes convergence. Therefore, the assumption is that the series converges, and the problem is to show the value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove both convergence and the value. But the problem as stated only asks to prove the sum equals the given expression. So perhaps the convergence is part of what needs to be proven, but the problem might assume convergence. However, in the example, the assumptions were taken from the problem's given conditions. Since the problem says \"Prove that...\", the assumptions are the conditions under which the proof is valid. Therefore, n being a positive integer is an assumption because the sum starts at n=1. Stirling's approximation is part of the problem's context, not an assumption. The problem refers to the error term in Stirling's approximation, so the term n^n/(n! e^n) - 1/√(2πn) is derived from Stirling's formula. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nStirling's approximation is valid for n!,\nThe Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is analytic at s=1/2,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ [n^n/(n! e^n) - 1/√(2πn)] converges.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state that Stirling's approximation is valid; it's part of the problem's background. Similarly, the zeta function is a given. So perhaps the only explicit assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the rest are part of the problem's context. However, in the user's example, they included assumptions that weren't in the original problem (like n divisible by 7). Therefore, maybe the user expects to list all conditions required for the problem to hold, even if they're not explicitly stated. For instance, in the current problem, to evaluate the sum, we might need that the series converges, which is an assumption. But the problem asks to prove the sum equals something, so perhaps convergence is part of the proof. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes convergence and wants the value. It's a bit ambiguous. But according to the example, assumptions are listed even if they're part of the problem's given. For example, in the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". The extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" seems to be a mistake. Wait, in the example, the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem was to prove for every integer n. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect, but perhaps in the user's example, there was a mistake. Therefore, perhaps I should just list the explicit assumptions from the problem statement. In the current problem, the user's question is to prove the sum equals the given expression. The problem states that it's a sum from n=1 to infinity. Therefore, the assumptions would be that n is a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1) and that each term in the series is as defined. However, perhaps more precise assumptions are needed. But since the example might have been erroneous, I should focus on the current problem. The problem mentions \"the error term in Stirling's approximation\", so maybe the assumption is that Stirling's approximation holds for each term, which allows replacing n! with its approximation. But the problem is to compute the sum of the error terms. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- Stirling's approximation for n! is used, leading to the error term [n^n/(n! e^n) - 1/√(2πn)].\n- The series converges, allowing the sum to be evaluated.\n\nBut again, the problem is to prove the sum equals the given value, so the convergence might be part of what's to be proven. However, the problem statement doesn't specify any particular conditions beyond n being a positive integer. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ [n^n/(n! e^n) - 1/√(2πn)] converges.\n\nBut the problem might not mention convergence explicitly. The user's attempt talks about partial summation and taking M to infinity, which suggests that the convergence is part of the proof. Therefore, perhaps the only explicit assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the rest are part of the problem's requirements. Alternatively, if we follow the example where assumptions were listed even if they were part of the problem's statement, then:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{n^n}{n!e^n}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}}\\right)=-\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{\\zeta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}.$$\n\nBut the example included an incorrect assumption (n divisible by 7), so maybe the user's example was flawed, but the correct approach is to list the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions. In the current problem, the problem states that the sum is from n=1 to infinity, so n is a positive integer. The other aspects (Stirling's approximation, convergence) are part of the problem's context but not explicit assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{n^n}{n!e^n}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}}\\right)=-\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{\\zeta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect. Perhaps there was a confusion between the problem's original statement and the formatted version. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that any conditions needed for the problem to hold are listed as assumptions. For instance, in the current problem, maybe the convergence of the series is an assumption. But the problem says \"Prove that the sum equals...\", which implies that the sum converges. So maybe the assumption is that the series converges. However, the problem might require proving convergence as part of the solution, but the problem statement as given doesn't specify that. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the rest is part of the problem's proof.",
