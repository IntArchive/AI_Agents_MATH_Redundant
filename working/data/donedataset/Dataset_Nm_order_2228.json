    "Content": "So I basically have to prove what is on the title. Given $R$ a commutative rng (a ring that might not contain a $1$ ), with the property that $I+J=R$ , (where $I$ and $J$ are ideals) we have to prove that $IJ=I\\cap J$ . One inclusion is easy. If $x\\in IJ$ , then $x=\\sum a_ib_i$ where $a_i\\in I$ and $b_i\\in J$ . Thus for any fixed $i$ , we have that since $a_i\\in I$ , we have that $a_ib_i\\in I$ , and the same argument shows that $a_ib_i\\in J$ , thus $\\sum a_ib_i\\in I$ and $\\sum a_ib_i\\in J$ , this means that $x=\\sum a_ib_i\\in I\\cap J$ , and thus $IJ\\subset I\\cap J$ . I am having troubles proving the other inclusion. Any comments? Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The statement you are trying to prove is only necessarily true for commutative rings with $1$ . In this case, you can argue that $$I\\cap J\\subseteq (I\\cap J)R=(I\\cap J)(I+J)=I(I\\cap J)+ J(I\\cap J)\\subseteq IJ+ IJ=IJ$$ A counterexample to the statement for general rngs is given by endowing the group $\\mathbb Z$ with the zero product, that is defining $a\\cdot b=0,\\forall a,b\\in\\mathbb Z$ . The ideals $(2)$ and $(3)$ are still comaximal, as for any $x\\in\\mathbb Z$ we can write $x=a\\times 2+b\\times 3$ for some $a,b\\in\\mathbb Z$ , where $\\times$ denotes regular multiplication, and $a\\times 2=2+\\cdots+2\\in(2)$ where addition is performed $a$ times, and similarly $b\\times 3\\in (3)$ . But $(2)\\cap (3)=(6)\\neq (0)$ , yet clearly $(2)(3)=(0)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that if I + J = R in a commutative rng (ring without necessarily having a multiplicative identity), then IJ = I ∩ J. The user already showed that IJ is a subset of I ∩ J and is stuck on the reverse inclusion. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions from the problem. Let's parse through the question again. The problem states:\n\n- R is a commutative rng. So, the ring is commutative, but might not have a 1. That's one assumption.\n- I and J are ideals of R. So, both I and J are ideals.\n- I + J = R. The sum of the ideals I and J equals the entire ring R.\n\nThese seem to be the key assumptions. Each of these should be listed line by line. The problem is to prove that IJ equals I ∩ J. \n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction has assumptions that sometimes specify conditions on one object each. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object.\n\nIn the current problem, the objects involved are R, I, and J. The properties are:\n\n1. R is a commutative rng. (This is about R.)\n2. I is an ideal of R. (About I.)\n3. J is an ideal of R. (About J.)\n4. I + J = R. (This is a relation between I and J, but since the format requires each assumption to apply to one object, maybe this needs to be phrased as \"I + J equals R\". But the original problem says \"Given R a commutative rng... with the property that I + J = R\". So maybe the assumption is that the sum of I and J is R. Hmm. The problem is given R is a commutative rng, and the ideals I and J satisfy I + J = R. So perhaps each assumption is:\n\n- R is a commutative rng.\n- I is an ideal of R.\n- J is an ideal of R.\n- I + J = R.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was two separate lines about n: being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, each condition on each object is a separate line. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. R is a commutative rng.\n2. I is an ideal of R.\n3. J is an ideal of R.\n4. I + J equals R.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that IJ = I ∩ J.\n\nLet me check if there's any other implicit assumptions. The problem doesn't mention any other conditions, like R being Noetherian or something else. The user's question also mentions that one inclusion is easy (IJ subset I ∩ J), so the challenge is the reverse. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are as above. So formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative rng,\nI is an ideal of R,\nJ is an ideal of R,\nI + J equals R.\n\nProblem:\nProve that IJ = I ∩ J.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object (R, I, J, then the relation between I and J). The problem is the equality of IJ and I ∩ J. So that should be the formatted version.",
