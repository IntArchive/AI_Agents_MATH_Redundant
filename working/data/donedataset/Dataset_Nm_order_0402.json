    "Content": "I was reading a textbook and saw an alternative formulation of nowhere dense. I am not sure how to prove this alternate formulation below: The Normal Nowhere Dense Statement: Let $X$ be a metric space. A subset $A ⊆ X$ is called nowhere dense in $X$ if the interior of\nthe closure of $A$ is empty, i.e. $(\\overline{A})^{\\circ} = ∅$. Otherwise put, $A$ is nowhere dense iﬀ it is contained in a closed set with empty interior. Alternate Formulation: \"Passing to complements, we can say equivalently that $A$ is nowhere dense iﬀ its complement contains a dense open set.\" Does anyone know how I can prove this? It seems rather painfully straightforward but I am not sure how to show it exactly. Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, you should know that, for any $B\\subseteq X$ , $X\\setminus\\overline{B}=(X\\setminus B)^\\circ$ and that $X\\setminus B^\\circ=\\overline{X\\setminus B}$ . Now \\begin{align*}\nA\\text{ nowhere dense }&\\iff\\left(\\overline{A}\\right)^\\circ=\\varnothing\\\\\n&\\iff X\\setminus(\\overline{A})^\\circ=X\\\\\n&\\iff\\overline{X\\setminus \\overline{A}}=X\\\\\n&\\iff\\overline{(X\\setminus A)^\\circ}=X\\\\\n&\\iff (X\\setminus A)^\\circ\\text{ is dense in }X\\\\\n&\\iff(X\\setminus A)\\text{ contains a dense open subset}.\n\\end{align*} The last equivalence may not be so obvious if you're not very used to metric spaces. See below, if necessary: If $(X\\setminus A)^\\circ$ is dense in $X$ , then $(X\\setminus A)^\\circ$ is a dense open subset of $X\\setminus A$ . Conversely, if $(X\\setminus A)$ contains a dense open subset $D$ , then $D\\subseteq (X\\setminus A)^\\circ$ , so $(X\\setminus A)^\\circ$ is dense as well.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that a set A being nowhere dense is equivalent to its complement containing a dense open set. \n\nFirst, let me recall the definitions. A set A is nowhere dense in a metric space X if the interior of its closure is empty. Symbolically, that's (closure of A)° = ∅. The alternate formulation says that A is nowhere dense if and only if the complement of A contains a dense open set.\n\nSo, the task is to prove an equivalence between two statements. Let me break it down into two directions.\n\nStarting with the forward direction: Assume A is nowhere dense. Then, by definition, the interior of the closure of A is empty. That means that closure of A has no interior points. Now, the complement of closure of A would be an open set (since closure is closed, complement is open). Let's call this complement X \\ cl(A). If closure of A has empty interior, then X \\ cl(A) must be dense. Because if a closed set has empty interior, its complement is dense. So, X \\ cl(A) is open and dense. But A is contained in its closure, so the complement of A contains X \\ cl(A), which is a dense open set. Wait, but X \\ cl(A) is a subset of X \\ A. Therefore, since X \\ cl(A) is dense, X \\ A must contain a dense open set. Therefore, the complement of A contains a dense open set. That takes care of the forward direction.\n\nNow for the reverse: Suppose the complement of A contains a dense open set. Let's call this dense open set U. So U is a subset of X \\ A, which implies that A is a subset of X \\ U. Since U is dense, its closure is X. But U is open, so the complement of U is closed. Therefore, X \\ U is closed. Now, since A is contained in X \\ U, the closure of A is also contained in X \\ U (because closures preserve containment). Now, X \\ U is closed, so cl(A) is a subset of X \\ U. Therefore, the interior of cl(A) is a subset of the interior of X \\ U. But since U is dense, X \\ U has empty interior. Because if a set's complement is dense open, then the set itself is nowhere dense. Wait, actually, if U is dense and open, then X \\ U is closed with empty interior. Because the closure of U is X, so the interior of X \\ U is empty. Therefore, the interior of cl(A) is a subset of a set with empty interior, hence it's empty. Therefore, A is nowhere dense.\n\nPutting both directions together, we've shown the equivalence. So, the key steps are relating the complement of A containing a dense open set to the closure of A having empty interior by taking complements and using properties of dense and open sets.",
