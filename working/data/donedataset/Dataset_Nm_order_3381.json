    "Content": "In an exercise I'm asked the following: a) Find a formula for $\\int (1-x^2)^n dx$ , for any $n \\in \\mathbb N$ . b) Prove that, for all $n \\in \\mathbb N$ : $$\\int_0^1(1-x^2)^n dx = \\frac{2^{2n}(n!)^2}{(2n + 1)!}$$ I used the binomial theorem in $a$ and got: $$\\int (1-x^2)^n dx = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\left( \\begin{matrix} n \\\\ k \\end{matrix} \\right) (-1)^k \\ \\frac{x^{2k + 1}}{2k+1} \\ \\ \\ + \\ \\ C$$ and so in part (b) i got: $$\\int_0^1 (1-x^2)^n dx = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\left( \\begin{matrix} n \\\\ k \\end{matrix} \\right) \\ \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}$$ I have no clue on how to arrive at the expression that I'm supposed to arrive. How can I solve this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I assume integration is done between $0$ and $1$ . For $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ , let's have $I_n=\\int_{0}^1(1-x^2)^{n}\\,dx$ . Then for any $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ , $$I_{n+1}=\\int_{0}^1 (1-x^2)(1-x^2)^{n}\\,dx=I_n-\\int_{0}^1 x^2(1-x^2)^{n}\\,dx$$ Integratin par parts : $$\\int_{0}^1 x^2(1-x^2)^{n}\\,dx=\\int_{0}^1 x\\times x(1-x^2)^{n}\\,dx=[x\\times\\frac{-(1-x^2)^{n+1}}{2n+2}]_0^1-\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{-1}{2n+2}(1-x^2)^{n+1}dx$$ Therefore $$\\int_{0}^1 x^2(1-x^2)^{n}\\,dx=\\frac{1}{2(n+1)}I_{n+1}$$ Going back to the first equality : $$I_{n+1}=I_n-\\frac{1}{2n+2}I_{n+1}$$ Reordering everything : $$I_{n+1}=\\frac{2(n+1)}{2n+3}I_n$$ Since $I_0=1$ , the former equality implies $I_n\\neq 0$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ . Let $n$ be a non-negative integer. Then $$\\frac{I_n}{I_0}=\\prod_{d=0}^{n-1}\\frac{I_{d+1}}{I_d}=\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\frac{2d+2}{2d+3}=\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\frac{2d+2}{2d+3}\\frac{2d+2}{2d+2}=\\frac{2^{2n}(n-1+1)!^2}{(2(n-1)+3)!}=\\frac{2^{2n}n!^2}{(2n+1)!}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem from the original question.\n\nLooking at the original question, part (a) asks for a formula for the indefinite integral of (1 - x²)^n for any natural number n. The user used the binomial theorem and expanded it into a summation. Then in part (b), they need to prove that the definite integral from 0 to 1 equals (2^{2n} (n!)^2)/(2n + 1)!).\n\nThe assumptions here would include that n is a natural number, since the problem states \"for any n ∈ ℕ\" and \"for all n ∈ ℕ\". Also, the integral is evaluated from 0 to 1, which is part of the problem's setup. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So here, the key assumptions are that n is a natural number and the integral bounds are from 0 to 1. The original problem doesn't mention any other conditions like specific values of n or additional constraints beyond being a natural number. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- n is a natural number,\n- the integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\n\nThe problem part is to prove the given expression for the definite integral. The user already expanded it using the binomial theorem but needs to connect that to the closed-form expression. They need help showing the summation they obtained equals the factorial expression provided.\n\nI should make sure that the assumptions are correctly extracted and that the problem is stated clearly. Also, check for any other implicit assumptions, but in this case, the problem seems straightforward with n being a natural number and the integral limits specified. There's no mention of other conditions or variables, so those two assumptions should suffice.",
