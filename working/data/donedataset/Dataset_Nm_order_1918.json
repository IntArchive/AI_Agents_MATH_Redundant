    "Content": "Title says it all. Well, maybe some backstory. Flipping through my past notebooks, I found this: $$ \\vdots $$ $$= \\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]}\\\\=\\frac14\\quad(?)$$ [ end of page ] Ah, yes. My engineering numerical analysis professor gave me one homework problem: Make a contour plot of the steady-state temperature distribution of a square plate, with the temperature of one of its side maintained at $1$ unit, the other three sides maintained at $0$ units. Steady-state temperature distribution $T$ follows $\\nabla^2T=0$ . I was calculating the temperature of the center of the plate analytically to sanity-check my program output, when I encountered this weird-looking sum. I remember I made a spreadsheet to numerically evaluate the sum, and Excel said 0.2500000... So I jot down $\\frac14$ with a question mark beside it. The next page is filled with my fruitless attempts to find out the exact sum, to convince myself that the sum is exactly $1/4$ . I posted a bounty on my social media accounts, whoever can show the proof (or disproof) gets free beer. After a few days, the bounty was still unclaimed, but I realized, \" duuuuuhhhh! I could just exploit the symmetry. If I rotate the plate $90^\\circ$ three times and superpose all the temperature distribution with the original one, temperature is $1$ unit everywhere. By linearity and symmetry, the temperature of the center point is therefore $1/4$ . \" I treated myself a few rounds of beer, and moved on. Case closed. Looking again at this, I now realize that I might be missing out on some summation tactics I never knew. Anybody can show me how is this equal to $1/4$ just by algebraic manipulation?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I am busy as hell today but this is such a nice problem (and amusingly posed question) i can't resist... :) The key idea here is simple: Look for a function in the complex plane $f(z)$ which has poles at the correct values $z_n$ and integrate it over an appropriate contour $C$. It turns out that the function (which is also the simplest guess i can imagine) $$\nf(z)=\\frac{1}{z \\cos(z)\\cosh(z)}\n$$ is the correct choice. Its poles are given by $z_0=0$, $z_k=\\frac{(2 k-1)\\pi}{2} $ and $\\tilde{z}_k=i \\frac{(2 k-1)\\pi}{2} $ with $k \\in \\mathbb{Z/0}$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to show that the infinite sum they provided equals 1/4. From their story, they already used a symmetry argument involving the temperature distribution on a square plate, but they're curious about a direct algebraic proof. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the original problem context. The sum arises from solving Laplace's equation for the steady-state temperature distribution in a square plate with three sides at 0 and one side at 1. The standard approach to solving this would involve separation of variables and Fourier series. The solution typically ends up as an infinite series, which in this case is the given sum. \n\nSo, the sum in question is:\n\n$$\n\\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi\\cosh\\left[(2k+1)\\pi/2\\right]} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nThe challenge is to evaluate this sum directly without relying on the physical symmetry argument. Let me think about possible methods.\n\nFirst, since the sum involves terms with $(2k+1)$ in the denominator and $\\cosh$ functions, it's likely related to Fourier series expansions or perhaps some integral transforms. The presence of $\\cosh$ suggests that hyperbolic identities might come into play. Also, alternating terms with $(-1)^k$ could hint at using series expansions of functions like arctangent or logarithmic functions, which have alternating series.\n\nAnother thought: the sum resembles the Fourier coefficients for a function defined on an interval, which when summed give a specific value at a point (like the center of the square). Maybe there's a way to relate this sum to evaluating the Fourier series at a particular point, say, (π/2, π/2) for the square, but that might loop back to the original PDE solution.\n\nAlternatively, could this sum be related to the Dirichlet beta function or some other special function? The Dirichlet beta function has terms similar to $(-1)^k / (2k+1)$, but here we have an additional $\\cosh$ term in the denominator. Maybe there's a way to express the sum in terms of known special functions or their integrals.\n\nWait, the $\\cosh$ term in the denominator might be connected to integral representations. For example, since $\\cosh(a) = \\frac{e^a + e^{-a}}{2}$, perhaps we can write the reciprocal as an integral. There's a standard integral formula: $\\frac{1}{\\cosh(a)} = 2 \\int_0^\\infty e^{-a \\cosh t} dt$ or something similar? Wait, maybe more straightforward: I recall that 1/cosh(x) can be expressed as a sech(x), and there are integral expressions involving sech. Alternatively, maybe using the geometric series for hyperbolic functions? \n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum can be expressed as an integral. For instance, since 1/(2k+1) is like integrating x^{2k} from 0 to 1, perhaps exchanging the sum and integral. Let me try to outline this.\n\nLet me write the term as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi \\cosh\\left[(2k+1)\\pi/2\\right]}\n$$\n\nSuppose I consider a generating function or integral representation for 1/(2k+1). For example, 1/(2k+1) = ∫₀¹ x^{2k} dx. Then substituting this into the sum, we get:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\left( \\int_0^1 x^{2k} dx \\right) \\frac{1}{\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]}\n$$\n\nInterchanging sum and integral (if allowed), this becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^1 \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k x^{2k}}{\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]} dx\n$$\n\nBut now the challenge is to evaluate the sum inside the integral. The term $\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]$ can be written as $\\cosh(\\pi/2 + k\\pi)$. But $\\cosh(a + b)$ is $\\cosh a \\cosh b + \\sinh a \\sinh b$, so if we substitute k here:\n\n$\\cosh(\\pi/2 + k\\pi) = \\cosh(\\pi/2)\\cosh(k\\pi) + \\sinh(\\pi/2)\\sinh(k\\pi)$\n\nBut for integer k, $\\cosh(k\\pi)$ and $\\sinh(k\\pi)$ are just hyperbolic functions evaluated at integer multiples of π. However, since $\\cosh(k\\pi)$ is the same for all k, but depending on parity. Wait, $\\cosh(k\\pi) = \\cosh(0)$ if k=0, but for k >=1, it's growing exponentially. Hmm, this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the definition of $\\cosh$ in terms of exponentials:\n\n$\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] = \\frac{e^{(2k+1)\\pi/2} + e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2}}{2}$\n\nSo, substituting that into the denominator:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]} = \\frac{2}{e^{(2k+1)\\pi/2} + e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2}} = \\frac{2 e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2}}{1 + e^{-(2k+1)\\pi}}\n$$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$$\n2 e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m e^{-(2k+1)\\pi m}\n$$\n\nBut wait, that is using the geometric series expansion for 1/(1 + q) = sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m q^m, valid for |q| <1. Since e^{-(2k+1)π} is very small (because π is about 3.14, so e^{-π} is about 0.043, so even for k=0, e^{-π} ≈0.043, which is less than 1, so the series converges.\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]} = 2 e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m e^{-(2k+1)\\pi m}\n$$\n\nThus, substituting back into the original sum:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi} \\cdot 2 e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m e^{-(2k+1)\\pi m}\n$$\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m e^{-(2k+1)\\pi m}\n$$\n\nNow, notice that the sums over k and m can be interchanged if convergence is absolute. Let's interchange them:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} e^{-(2k+1)\\pi m}\n$$\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n$$\ne^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} \\cdot e^{-(2k+1)\\pi m} = e^{-(2k+1)\\pi (m + 1/2)} = e^{-(2k+1)\\pi (m + 1/2)}\n$$\n\nSo the inner sum becomes:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} e^{-(2k+1)\\pi (m + 1/2)}\n$$\n\nLet me denote t = π(m + 1/2), so the inner sum is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} e^{-(2k+1) t}\n$$\n\nThis looks familiar. Recall that the Taylor series expansion of arctangent is:\n\n$$\n\\arctan(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k z^{2k+1}}{2k+1}\n$$\n\nBut here we have an exponential term instead. Let's see. If we set z = e^{-t}, then:\n\n$$\n\\arctan(e^{-t}) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k e^{-(2k+1)t}}{2k+1}\n$$\n\nExactly! So the inner sum over k is equal to arctan(e^{-t}), where t = π(m + 1/2). Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} e^{-(2k+1) t} = \\arctan(e^{-t})\n$$\n\nTherefore, substituting back t = π(m + 1/2):\n\n$$\n\\arctan(e^{-\\pi(m + 1/2)})\n$$\n\nThus, the entire expression becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m \\arctan\\left(e^{-\\pi(m + 1/2)}\\right)\n$$\n\nSo now we have to evaluate:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m \\arctan\\left(e^{-\\pi(m + 1/2)}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis seems tricky, but maybe there's a telescoping nature or some identity related to the arctangent of exponentials. Let's recall that arctan(e^{-x}) can be related to integrals or perhaps to logarithmic functions. \n\nAlternatively, note that arctan(e^{-x}) + arctan(e^{x}) = π/2, since tan(π/2 - θ) = cot θ = 1/tan θ. So, if we set θ = arctan(e^{-x}), then tan θ = e^{-x}, so tan(π/2 - θ) = e^{x}, hence π/2 - θ = arctan(e^{x}), which gives the identity. However, not sure if this helps here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that e^{-π(m + 1/2)} = e^{-\\pi/2} \\cdot e^{- \\pi m}. Let’s denote q = e^{-π}, which is a small number (since e^{-π} ≈ 0.043). So e^{-π(m + 1/2)} = e^{-\\pi/2} q^m.\n\nSo the term inside the arctan is e^{-\\pi/2} q^m, which is a rapidly decreasing sequence. Therefore, each term in the sum is arctan of a very small number for large m, so maybe the sum converges quickly, but we need an exact evaluation.\n\nAlternatively, use the series expansion for arctan. Since arctan(z) = z - z^3/3 + z^5/5 - ... for |z| ≤ 1. Since e^{-π(m + 1/2)} is always less than 1, this is valid. So:\n\n$$\n\\arctan(e^{-\\pi(m + 1/2)}) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n e^{-\\pi(2n+1)(m + 1/2)}}{2n+1}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the sum over m:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n e^{-\\pi(2n+1)(m + 1/2)}}{2n+1}\n$$\n\nInterchanging the sums (if permissible):\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} e^{-\\pi(2n+1)/2} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m e^{-\\pi(2n+1) m}\n$$\n\nThe inner sum over m is a geometric series:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (-1)^m e^{-\\pi(2n+1) m} = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\left( -e^{-\\pi(2n+1)} \\right)^m = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\pi(2n+1)}}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-\\pi(2n+1)/2}}{1 + e^{-\\pi(2n+1)}}\n$$\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n$$\n1 + e^{-\\pi(2n+1)} = e^{-\\pi(2n+1)/2} \\left( e^{\\pi(2n+1)/2} + e^{-\\pi(2n+1)/2} \\right) = 2 e^{-\\pi(2n+1)/2} \\cosh\\left( \\frac{\\pi(2n+1)}{2} \\right)\n$$\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-\\pi(2n+1)/2}}{2 e^{-\\pi(2n+1)/2} \\cosh\\left( \\frac{\\pi(2n+1)}{2} \\right)} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2 \\cosh\\left( \\frac{\\pi(2n+1)}{2} \\right)}\n$$\n\nSimplifying constants:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1) \\cosh\\left( \\frac{\\pi(2n+1)}{2} \\right)}\n$$\n\nWait a minute, this is the same as the original sum but multiplied by 1/2 and with n instead of k. So substituting back, this expression equals (1/2) * S, where S is the original sum. But then we have:\n\nOriginal expression was:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4}{\\pi} \\times \\text{[something]} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\times \\frac{1}{2} S = \\frac{2}{\\pi} S\n$$\n\nBut according to our manipulations, this should equal the original sum S. Therefore:\n\n$$\nS = \\frac{2}{\\pi} S \\implies S \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right) = 0 \\implies S = 0\n$$\n\nBut this contradicts the original assertion that S = 1/4. Clearly, there's a mistake in the manipulation somewhere. This suggests that interchanging sums and integrals or series might not be valid here, or perhaps a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is leading us in circles. Let me think of another way.\n\nGiven that the sum comes from a physical problem involving the center temperature of a square plate, perhaps using complex analysis or Poisson summation formula? Alternatively, since the solution to Laplace's equation can be expressed using Fourier series, and evaluating at the center gives the sum. But the user wants an algebraic proof.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for the square plate with boundary conditions T(0, y)=1 and T(1, y)=T(x, 0)=T(x, 1)=0, the solution is:\n\n$$\nT(x, y) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi (1 - x)] \\sin[(2k+1)\\pi y]}{(2k+1) \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi]}\n$$\n\nAt the center (x=1/2, y=1/2), this becomes:\n\n$$\nT(1/2, 1/2) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi (1/2)] \\sin[(2k+1)\\pi (1/2)]}{(2k+1) \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi]}\n$$\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n$\\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] = \\frac{e^{(2k+1)\\pi/2} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2}}{2}$\n\n$\\sin[(2k+1)\\pi/2] = \\sin(k\\pi + \\pi/2) = (-1)^k$\n\n$\\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi] = \\frac{e^{(2k+1)\\pi} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi}}{2}$\n\nTherefore, substituting these into the expression:\n\n$$\nT(1/2, 1/2) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{e^{(2k+1)\\pi/2} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2}}{2} \\right) (-1)^k }{(2k+1) \\left( \\frac{e^{(2k+1)\\pi} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi}}{2} \\right) }\n$$\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: $\\frac{e^{(2k+1)\\pi/2} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2}}{2} \\times (-1)^k = \\frac{(-1)^k}{2} \\left( e^{(2k+1)\\pi/2} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} \\right)$\n\nDenominator: $(2k+1) \\times \\frac{e^{(2k+1)\\pi} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi}}{2} = \\frac{(2k+1)}{2} \\left( e^{(2k+1)\\pi} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi} \\right)$\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n$$\nT(1/2, 1/2) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ \\frac{(-1)^k}{2} \\left( e^{(2k+1)\\pi/2} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} \\right) }{ \\frac{(2k+1)}{2} \\left( e^{(2k+1)\\pi} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi} \\right) } = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k \\left( e^{(2k+1)\\pi/2} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} \\right) }{ (2k+1) \\left( e^{(2k+1)\\pi} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi} \\right) }\n$$\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: $e^{(2k+1)\\pi/2} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} = e^{-(2k+1)\\pi/2} \\left( e^{(2k+1)\\pi} - 1 \\right)$\n\nDenominator: $e^{(2k+1)\\pi} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi} = e^{(2k+1)\\pi} \\left( 1 - e^{-2(2k+1)\\pi} \\right )$\n\nBut perhaps more straightforward:\n\nNotice that the denominator is $e^{(2k+1)\\pi} - e^{-(2k+1)\\pi} = 2 \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi]$, and the numerator is $2 \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]$. So:\n\n$$\nT(1/2, 1/2) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k \\cdot 2 \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] }{ (2k+1) \\cdot 2 \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi] } = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] }{ (2k+1) \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi] }\n$$\n\nNow, note that $\\sinh(2x) = 2 \\sinh x \\cosh x$, so $\\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi] = 2 \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]$. Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi] = 2 \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]\n$$\n\nThus, substituting back:\n\n$$\nT(1/2, 1/2) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] }{ (2k+1) \\cdot 2 \\sinh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] } } = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k }{ 2(2k+1) \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] }\n$$\n\nSimplifying constants:\n\n$$\nT(1/2, 1/2) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k }{ (2k+1) \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] }\n$$\n\nBut according to the problem statement, this sum equals 1/4. Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{\\pi} S = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies S = \\frac{\\pi}{8}\n$$\n\nWait, but this contradicts the original assertion that S = 1/4. Clearly, there's a mistake here. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, the user's original sum is:\n\n$$\n\\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]}\n$$\n\nAccording to our calculation, T(1/2,1/2) = (2/π) S, and the user says that T(1/2,1/2) = 1/4. Therefore:\n\n(2/π) S = 1/4 => S = π/8 ≈ 0.3927, which contradicts the user's numerical result of 0.25. Therefore, something is wrong here.\n\nBut according to the user's story, their numerical evaluation gave 0.25, which they attributed to symmetry. So there must be an error in the standard Fourier series solution approach, or perhaps in the boundary conditions.\n\nWait, the problem states that three sides are at 0 and one side is at 1. The standard solution for a square with one side held at 1 and the others at 0 would indeed result in the Fourier series solution we have above, but the user's symmetry argument gives 1/4. This suggests that either the Fourier series is incorrect, or the user's symmetry argument is flawed. However, the numerical result supports 1/4.\n\nThis indicates a contradiction. Therefore, the mistake must be in the application of the boundary conditions in the Fourier series solution. Let me double-check the solution setup.\n\nIn the problem, the temperature is maintained at 1 on one side and 0 on the other three. Assuming the plate is [0,1]x[0,1], with, say, T(x,0)=1 and T(0,y)=T(1,y)=T(x,1)=0.\n\nThe solution using separation of variables would be:\n\n$$\nT(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty B_n \\sin(n\\pi x) \\sinh(n\\pi (1 - y))\n$$\n\nApplying T(x,0)=1:\n\n$$\n1 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty B_n \\sin(n\\pi x) \\sinh(n\\pi)\n$$\n\nUsing orthogonality, the coefficients B_n are found by:\n\n$$\nB_n \\sinh(n\\pi) = 2 \\int_0^1 \\sin(n\\pi x) dx = \\frac{2(1 - (-1)^n)}{n\\pi}\n$$\n\nThus, B_n = \\frac{2(1 - (-1)^n)}{n\\pi \\sinh(n\\pi)}\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n$$\nT(x,y) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1 - (-1)^n}{n} \\sin(n\\pi x) \\frac{\\sinh(n\\pi (1 - y))}{\\sinh(n\\pi)}\n$$\n\nNotice that 1 - (-1)^n is 0 when n is even, and 2 when n is odd. Thus, the solution simplifies to:\n\n$$\nT(x,y) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k+1} \\sin((2k+1)\\pi x) \\frac{\\sinh((2k+1)\\pi (1 - y))}{\\sinh((2k+1)\\pi)}\n$$\n\nAt the center, x=1/2, y=1/2:\n\n$$\nT(1/2,1/2) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k+1} \\sin((2k+1)\\pi/2) \\frac{\\sinh((2k+1)\\pi/2)}{\\sinh((2k+1)\\pi)}\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$\\sin((2k+1)\\pi/2) = (-1)^k$\n\n$\\sinh((2k+1)\\pi/2)/\\sinh((2k+1)\\pi) = \\frac{\\sinh(a)}{\\sinh(2a)} = \\frac{1}{2 \\cosh(a)}$ where a=(2k+1)\\pi/2. Therefore,\n\n$$\nT(1/2,1/2) = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k }{2k+1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2 \\cosh((2k+1)\\pi/2)} } = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k }{ (2k+1) \\cosh((2k+1)\\pi/2) }\n$$\n\nSo indeed, the sum S in the problem is:\n\n$$\nS = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k }{ (2k+1) \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] } = T(1/2,1/2)\n$$\n\nBut according to the user, T(1/2,1/2) = 1/4, so S = 1/4. However, according to the Fourier series solution, S = T(1/2,1/2) = (2/π) * sum(...) = 1/4. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\times \\text{[sum]} = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies \\text{[sum]} = \\frac{\\pi}{8}\n$$\n\nBut the user claims that [sum] = 1/4, which suggests that either there's a miscalculation in the Fourier series derivation, or the boundary conditions were different.\n\nWait, this is critical. Let me double-check the boundary conditions. The user said: \"temperature of one of its side maintained at 1 unit, the other three sides maintained at 0 units.\" Which side is which? The standard solution I used assumes T(x,0)=1 and T(0,y)=T(1,y)=T(x,1)=0. However, if the 1 unit side is a different one, say T(0,y)=1 and the others 0, the solution would be different.\n\nSuppose instead that the side with temperature 1 is the left side, T(0,y)=1, and T(1,y)=T(x,0)=T(x,1)=0. Then the solution would be:\n\n$$\nT(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty B_n \\sin(n\\pi y) \\sinh(n\\pi (1 - x))\n$$\n\nFollowing similar steps, at the center (1/2,1/2):\n\n$$\nT(1/2,1/2) = \\frac{4}{\\π} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k }{ (2k+1) \\cosh((2k+1)\\pi/2) }\n$$\n\nWhich is the same expression, so regardless of which side is held at 1, the expression for the center temperature would be the same due to symmetry. However, according to the user's symmetry argument, rotating the plate 90 degrees and superposing, each contribution is 1/4. Therefore, the center temperature must be 1/4.\n\nBut according to the Fourier series solution, it's (2/π) * sum(...) = 1/4, implying the sum is π/8 ≈ 0.3927, which is not 1/4. This inconsistency suggests that there's a mistake in either the Fourier series derivation or the user's symmetry argument.\n\nWait, but the user claims that numerically evaluating the sum gives 0.25, which contradicts the Fourier series result. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem setup. However, the user's sum is:\n\n$$\n\\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]}\n$$\n\nAccording to our derivation, this equals T(1/2,1/2) = 1/4. But according to the Fourier series solution, this sum equals (2/π) * sum(...) = 1/4, implying that the sum in the problem is indeed 1/4, which aligns with the user's numerical result. Wait, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nIf T(1/2,1/2) = 1/4, then according to the expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k }{ (2k+1) \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] } = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nTherefore, solving for the sum:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k }{ (2k+1) \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] } = \\frac{\\pi}{8}\n$$\n\nBut the user's sum S is:\n\n$$\nS = \\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^k }{ (2k+1) \\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2] } = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nAh! Therefore, the sum S as defined by the user is indeed 1/4. The confusion was in mislabeling the sum. The user's sum S includes the 2/π factor, which when multiplied by the inner sum (which is π/8) gives 1/4. Therefore, the steps are correct, and the Fourier series solution does yield S = 1/4. Therefore, the original problem's sum is 1/4, and the derivation via the physical argument aligns with the Fourier series solution.\n\nBut the user wants an algebraic proof of the sum, not relying on the physical argument. So, going back, how can we directly evaluate the sum:\n\n$$\nS = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi\\cosh[(2k+1)\\pi/2]} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nWe need to find a way to show this sum equals 1/4 using algebraic manipulations or known series identities.\n\nOne approach is to recognize this sum as a special value of a theta function or related to elliptic integrals, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Poisson summation formula, which connects sums over integers to sums over their Fourier transforms. However, applying Poisson summation here requires knowing the appropriate function to use.\n\nAnother idea is to relate the sum to an integral that can be evaluated. For example, since 1/cosh can be expressed as an integral, perhaps combining the sum and integral.\n\nRecall that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\cosh(a)} = 2 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(2 a t/\\pi)}{\\cosh(\\pi t)} dt\n$$\n\nThis is one of the integral representations for sech(a). If we substitute this into the sum, we get:\n\n$$\nS = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2(-1)^k}{(2k+1)\\pi} \\times 2 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(2 \\times (2k+1)\\pi/2 \\times t/\\pi)}{\\cosh(\\pi t)} dt = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\cos((2k+1) t)}{\\cosh(\\pi t)} dt\n$$\n\nInterchange sum and integral:\n\n$$\nS = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\pi t)} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k \\cos((2k+1) t)}{2k+1} dt\n$$\n\nThe inner sum is a known Fourier series. Recall that:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k \\cos((2k+1) t)}{2k+1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\quad \\text{for } |t| < \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\n\nWait, but this might not be accurate. Let me recall the Fourier series expansion.\n\nThe series resembles the Fourier series of a rectangular wave or a step function. Specifically, consider the function f(t) which is π/4 for |t| < π/2 and -π/4 for π/2 < |t| < π, extended periodically. The Fourier series of such a function involves terms like sum_{k=0}^\\infty [ (-1)^k / (2k+1) ] cos((2k+1)t). \n\nAlternatively, recall that:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} \\cos((2k+1)t) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{sech}(t)\n$$\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me look up standard series. \n\nAlternatively, integrating term by term. Consider the series:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} \\cos((2k+1)t)\n$$\n\nThis is the real part of the series:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} e^{i(2k+1)t} = e^{it} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k e^{i2kt}}{2k+1}\n$$\n\nWhich is similar to the expansion of arctangent. Recall that:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k z^{2k+1}}{2k+1} = \\arctan(z)\n$$\n\nSo if we set z = e^{it}, then:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k e^{i(2k+1)t}}{2k+1} = \\arctan(e^{it})\n$$\n\nTaking the real part:\n\n$$\n\\text{Re}\\left( \\arctan(e^{it}) \\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k \\cos((2k+1)t)}{2k+1}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the real part of arctan(e^{it}). Let's compute this:\n\nLet’s set z = e^{it} = cos t + i sin t. Then:\n\n$$\n\\arctan(z) = \\frac{1}{2i} \\ln\\left( \\frac{1 + iz}{1 - iz} \\right)\n$$\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, note that for real numbers, arctan(z) is the argument of the complex number 1 + iz. So, perhaps expressing this in terms of logarithms.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for z = e^{it}, we have:\n\n$$\n\\arctan(e^{it}) = \\int_0^{e^{it}} \\frac{1}{1 + w^2} dw\n$$\n\nBut integrating along the complex plane might not be helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity:\n\n$$\n\\arctan(e^{it}) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{i}{2} \\ln\\left( \\frac{1 - ie^{it}}{1 + ie^{it}} \\right)\n$$\n\nBut extracting the real part from this expression requires careful calculation. Perhaps instead, we can use the expansion in real numbers.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for t real, the sum:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k \\cos((2k+1)t)}{2k+1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{sech}(t)\n$$\n\nBut I need to verify this. Suppose t=0:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n$$\n\nWhich is correct (Leibniz's formula). So at t=0, the sum is π/4. On the other hand, sech(0)=1, so π/4 sech(0)=π/4, which matches.\n\nFor t approaching infinity, sech(t) approaches 0, and the sum would also approach 0 due to the oscillating cosine terms, which suggests the identity might hold. However, I need to confirm whether this identity is valid.\n\nAssuming that:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k \\cos((2k+1)t)}{2k+1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{sech}\\left( \\frac{\\pi t}{2} \\right)\n$$\n\nWait, but the argument in sech should match the frequency. Let's check dimensions. If t is a variable, then the standard identity might require scaling.\n\nAlternatively, refer to standard Fourier series expansions. For example, the Fourier series of sech(t) is known, but I might need to look it up.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Poisson summation formula. The sum over k of (-1)^k / (2k+1) cos((2k+1)t) can be expressed as a sum over delta functions or something similar, but this is getting too abstract.\n\nAssuming that the inner sum is equal to π/4 sech(π t / 2), then substituting back into S:\n\n$$\nS = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\cosh(\\pi t)} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{sech}\\left( \\frac{\\pi t}{2} \\right) dt = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\text{sech}(\\pi t / 2)}{\\cosh(\\pi t)} dt\n$$\n\nSimplify the integrand. Let’s substitute u = π t / 2, so t = 2u / π, dt = 2 du / π:\n\n$$\nS = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\text{sech}(u)}{\\cosh(2u)} du\n$$\n\nNow, use the identity cosh(2u) = 2 cosh^2 u -1:\n\n$$\nS = \\frac{2}{\\π} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\text{sech}(u)}{2 \\cosh^2 u -1} du\n$$\n\nBut this seems more complicated. Alternatively, express sech(u) and cosh(2u) in terms of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\text{sech}(u) = \\frac{2}{e^u + e^{-u}}, \\quad \\cosh(2u) = \\frac{e^{2u} + e^{-2u}}{2}\n$$\n\nBut integrating this might not be straightforward. Perhaps a substitution v = e^u, but this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, recognize that the integral after substitution might evaluate to π/8, leading to S = 1/4. However, this approach is not yielding immediate results.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the steps taken, I think the key insight is recognizing that the sum can be directly related to the physical problem's symmetry argument, and thus equals 1/4. However, for an algebraic proof, one needs to connect the sum to known mathematical identities or integrals that evaluate to 1/4.\n\nAnother angle: the sum can be expressed in terms of the Jacobi theta functions or related elliptic functions, which have known properties and identities. However, this requires specialized knowledge beyond basic calculus.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Residue Theorem from complex analysis to evaluate the sum. Sums over k can sometimes be expressed as residues of certain meromorphic functions. For example, consider a function f(z) with poles at z = ... and residues corresponding to the summand terms. Integrating this function over an appropriate contour could yield the sum as a residue sum, which might cancel out to give 1/4.\n\nHowever, this method is quite involved and requires constructing the right function and contour. Given the time constraints, I think the most feasible approach for the user is to accept that the sum evaluates to 1/4 via the symmetry argument, and that a direct algebraic proof would involve advanced techniques beyond elementary methods, possibly utilizing Fourier transforms, Poisson summation, or complex analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's symmetry argument provides an elegant solution, a direct algebraic manipulation to prove the sum equals 1/4 would likely require sophisticated methods from Fourier analysis or complex integration, which are non-trivial and time-consuming to apply here.",
