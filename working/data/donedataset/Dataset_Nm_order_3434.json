    "Content": "Prove that $n^{2003}+n+1$  is composite for every $n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\backslash\\{1\\}$. I tried with expanding $n^{2003}+1$, but I got nothing pretty not useful. I also couldn't get any improvement, let alone contradiction for assuming $n^{2003}+n+1=pq$ where $p,q\\not= 1$. How should I do this and are there general tips on how to approach these problems, what to think about?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $w=e^{i2\\pi/3}$. It's easy to see that $w$ and $w^2$ are all the roots of $x^2+x+1$ and roots of $x^{2003}+x+1$, therefore $x^2+x+1|x^{2003}+x+1$. So we have That $x^{2003}+x+1=(x^2+x+1)P(x)$, where $P(x)$ is some polynomial with integer coefficients. For $x\\ge 2$, $x^{2003}+x+1$ is much bigger than $x^2+x+1$ so $P(x)$ is some integer greater than $2$ from which the conclusion follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The task is to prove that for every natural number n except 1, the expression n²⁰⁰³ + n + 1 is composite. Hmm, that's a pretty high exponent. I remember similar problems where polynomials factor in certain ways or have roots that can be exploited. Maybe I should look for patterns or possible factors.\n\nFirst, maybe plug in some small values of n to see what happens. Let's start with n=2: 2²⁰⁰³ + 2 + 1. That's a huge number, but regardless, it's definitely a sum of even and odd numbers. Wait, 2²⁰⁰³ is even, 2 is even, and 1 is odd. So total is even + even + odd = odd. So the result is odd. Similarly, n=3: 3²⁰⁰³ is odd, 3 is odd, 1 is odd. Odd + odd + odd = odd. So all results are odd. That's good because even numbers would be composite except for 2, but since n starts at 2, the result is at least 2²⁰⁰³ + 2 + 1, which is way larger than 2, so if it's even, it's composite. But here it's always odd, so need another approach.\n\nWait, maybe there's a root that can be factored out. If the polynomial n²⁰⁰³ + n + 1 has a root modulo some prime, then maybe it's divisible by that prime for certain n. Alternatively, maybe we can use some cyclotomic polynomial factorization? Not sure. Alternatively, look for n where n²⁰⁰³ ≡ -n -1 mod p for some prime p, making the expression divisible by p.\n\nAlternatively, think about the exponent 2003. That's a prime number, right? 2003 is prime. Maybe that's relevant. Sometimes when exponents are primes, you can use Fermat's little theorem or properties related to primes. Let me check: 2003 divided by, say, 3 is 667.666... so 3*667=2001, remainder 2. So 2003 is prime. Yes, 2003 is a prime number. So maybe that's a clue.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps factor the polynomial n²⁰⁰³ + n + 1. But factoring such a high-degree polynomial seems difficult. However, maybe there's a substitution that can help. Let's see. Suppose we let m = n^k for some k, but not sure. Alternatively, think about roots of unity. If the polynomial has a root ω such that ω²⁰⁰³ + ω + 1 = 0, then maybe it factors into (n - ω) times something. But over integers, that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe using the fact that if a polynomial has a root modulo p for some prime p, then it's divisible by p. So maybe for certain n, n²⁰⁰³ + n + 1 is divisible by a small prime, hence composite. Let's try small primes.\n\nTake p=3. For n ≡ 0 mod 3: then the expression is 0 + 0 +1 =1 mod 3, which is 1, not divisible by 3. For n≡1 mod 3: 1 +1 +1=3≡0 mod3. So if n≡1 mod3, then the expression is divisible by 3. Therefore, unless the expression equals 3 itself, which would require n²⁰⁰³ +n +1=3. Let's check n=1: but n=1 is excluded. n=2: 2²⁰⁰³ +2 +1 is way larger than 3. So for any n≡1 mod3 (except n=1), the expression is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, hence composite. So that covers all n≡1 mod3.\n\nWhat about other residues modulo3? For n≡2 mod3: then n²⁰⁰³ mod3. Since 2003 mod 2 (because 3-1=2, Fermat's little theorem exponent cycle every 2). Wait, 2003 is odd, so 2²⁰⁰³ ≡2 mod3. So 2 +2 +1=5≡2 mod3. Not divisible by3. So for n≡2 mod3, expression is 2 mod3, not divisible by3.\n\nSo now, we have that when n≡1 mod3, the expression is divisible by3. So for those n, it's composite. Now, we need to handle the other cases where n≡0 or 2 mod3.\n\nWait, n∈N\\{1}, so n≥2. For n≡0 mod3: n is a multiple of3. Let's take n=3,6,9,... For n=3: 3²⁰⁰³ +3 +1. Let's compute modulo something else. Maybe modulo 7? Let's see. 3 mod7 is3. 3^6≡1 mod7 by Fermat. 2003 divided by6: 6*333=1998, remainder5. So 3²⁰⁰³ ≡3^5≡243≡243-7*34=243-238=5 mod7. So 3²⁰⁰³ +3 +1 ≡5 +3 +1=9≡2 mod7. Not divisible by7.\n\nAlternatively, try modulo 13. For n=3, compute 3²⁰⁰³ mod13. 13-1=12. 2003 mod12: 2003=12*166 + 11. So 3^11 mod13. 3^2=9, 3^4=81≡3, 3^8≡9 mod13. So 3^11=3^8*3^2*3≡9*9*3=243≡243-18*13=243-234=9 mod13. Then 9 +3 +1=13≡0 mod13. So 3²⁰⁰³ +3 +1≡0 mod13. Therefore, when n=3, the expression is divisible by13. Since 3²⁰⁰³ is huge, the expression is much larger than13, hence composite.\n\nWait, so maybe for n≡0 mod3, the expression is divisible by13? Let's check another multiple of3. Take n=6. Compute 6²⁰⁰³ +6 +1 mod13. 6 mod13=6. 6^12≡1 mod13 by Fermat. 2003 mod12=11. So 6^11 mod13. Let's compute 6^2=36≡10, 6^4=10²=100≡9, 6^8≡9²=81≡3, so 6^11=6^8*6^2*6=3*10*6=180≡180-13*13=180-169=11 mod13. Then 11 +6 +1=18≡5 mod13. Not divisible by13. Hmm, so that approach doesn't hold. Maybe the modulus depends on something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n²⁰⁰³ +n +1 is divisible by another prime when n≡0 mod3. Let's try n=3 again. The expression is 3²⁰⁰³ +3 +1. We need to check if this is divisible by some prime. As above, it's divisible by13 when n=3, but not when n=6. So perhaps there's a pattern where for n divisible by3, it's sometimes divisible by13 or other primes. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a different modulus. Let's think about when n²⁰⁰³ ≡ -n -1 mod p. We need to find primes p where there exists an n such that this congruence holds. For example, if we can find a p such that for all n not ≡1 mod3, there exists some prime p that divides the expression, then we can cover all n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the polynomial n²⁰⁰³ +n +1 and see if it can be factored. Since 2003 is a prime, maybe there's a way to write it as a product of lower-degree polynomials. But since the polynomial is of prime degree, it's irreducible unless it has a root. Wait, but the polynomial doesn't have integer roots. Let's check: if f(n)=n²⁰⁰³ +n +1. If there's an integer root, then f(k)=0. But for k positive integer, n²⁰⁰³ is positive, so f(k) is positive. For k=0, f(0)=1≠0. For k negative, say k=-m, m>0, then (-m)^2003 + (-m) +1 = -m²⁰⁰³ -m +1. For m≥1, this is negative +1, which might be zero? For m=1: -1 -1 +1=-1≠0. So no integer roots. Therefore, the polynomial doesn't factor into linear terms. But maybe it factors into higher-degree polynomials with integer coefficients. However, proving that seems difficult.\n\nAnother approach: Use the fact that for certain exponents, n^k +n +1 factors. For example, when k ≡2 mod3, n^k +n +1 is divisible by n² +n +1. Wait, let's check. Suppose k=3m+2. Then n^{3m+2} +n +1. Let's see if n² +n +1 is a factor. Let ω be a root of n² +n +1=0, so ω³=1. Then n^{3m+2}=ω^{3m+2}=ω^{2}, since ω³=1. So substituting ω into the expression: ω^{2} + ω +1=0, which is exactly the equation. Therefore, n² +n +1 divides n^{3m+2} +n +1. So if 2003 ≡2 mod3, then this would work. Let's check 2003 mod3: 2003 divided by3 is 667*3 + 2. Yes, 2003≡2 mod3. Therefore, n²⁰⁰³ +n +1 is divisible by n² +n +1. Therefore, for any n where n² +n +1 ≥2, the expression is composite.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me verify. If 2003=3m+2, then m=667. Therefore, n²⁰⁰³ +n +1=(n² +n +1)*Q(n), where Q(n) is some polynomial. Therefore, for any n≥2, n² +n +1 is at least 2² +2 +1=7, so the expression factors into two integers greater than1, hence composite. Except when n² +n +1=1, which would require n² +n=0, so n=0 or n=-1, but n is in N\\{1}, so n=0 is excluded. Therefore, for all n≥2, n² +n +1≥7, so the factorization gives two factors greater than1, hence composite.\n\nTherefore, the key is that 2003≡2 mod3, allowing us to factor the expression using the cyclotomic polynomial n² +n +1. Therefore, the proof follows from this factorization.\n\nSo the problem's assumption is that n is a natural number not equal to1, and the problem is to prove that n²⁰⁰³ +n +1 is composite.",
