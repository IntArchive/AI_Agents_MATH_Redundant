    "Content": "I am wondering two different forms of the second mean value theorem for integration. For the one in wikipedia , I also wonder where I can find a proof. The form I read from another reference is that:\n$G:[a,b]\\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a monotonic function and $\\phi : [a, b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is an integrable function, then there exists a number $x$ in $[a, b]$ such that $$\\int_a^b {G(t)\\phi(t)}dt=G(a)\\int_a^x{\\phi(t)dt}+G(b)\\int_x^b{\\phi(t)dt}.$$ Note the difference in where $x$ lies and whether to use the one-side limit for $G(a)$ and $G(b)$. To me, I think whether $G$ is right continuous at $a$ or left continuous at $b$ should not matter the integral $$\\int_a^b {G(t)\\phi(t)}dt$$, but clearly $G(a)$ vs. $G(a+)$ can be quite different. I am wondering if anyone can give me a proof that the two are equivalent. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Some notations. First, for every $x$ in $[a,b]$, let $F(x)=\\displaystyle\\int_a^x\\phi(t)\\mathrm{d}t$, hence $F$ is continuous and $F(a)=0$. Second, assume that $G$ is nondecreasing, the other case being similar. Thus there exists a nonnegative measure $\\mu$ such that, for every $x$ in $[a,b]$, $G(x)=G(a)+\\displaystyle\\int_a^x\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t)$. Now to the proof. Using an integration by parts, the integral $I$ of $G\\phi$ over $[a,b]$ is\n$$\nI=[F(t)G(t)]_a^b-\\int_a^bF(t)\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t)=F(b)G(b)-\\int_a^bF(t)\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t).\n$$\nThe hypothesis made on $G$ means that $\\mu$ is a nonnegative measure hence the first mean value theorem for integration yields the existence of a point $x$ in $[a,b]$ such that\n$$\n\\int_a^bF(t)\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t)=F(x)\\int_a^b\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t)=F(x)(G(b)-G(a)).\n$$\nComing back to $I$, one gets\n$$\nI=F(b)G(b)-F(x)(G(b)-G(a))=G(a)F(x)+G(b)(F(b)-F(x)),\n$$\nwhich, by definition of $F$, is the desired assertion. (No continuity of $G$ is required.) In case you are wondering, the first mean value theorem used above is not the usual one but it has the same proof than the usual one. Namely, $F$ being continuous on the compact set $[a,b]$ has a maximum $M$ and a minimum $m$ on $[a,b]$, thus\n$$\nm\\int_a^b\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t)\\le\\int_a^bF(t)\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t)\\le M\\int_a^b\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t).\n$$\n(This step uses the hypothesis that $\\mu$ has constant sign.) In other words, there exists $u$ in $[m,M]$ such that\n$$\n\\int_a^bF(t)\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t)=u\\int_a^b\\mathrm{d}\\mu(t).\n$$\nNow, the continuity of $F$ implies that there exists $x$ in $[a,b]$ such that $u=F(x)$ and you are done. Previous version When $\\phi$ has a constant sign, this is a consequence of the intermediate value theorem . (An earlier version of this post did not assume $\\phi$ of constant sign, hence an argument was wrong. Thanks to the OP for having asked some explanations.) Let $I$ denote the integral of $G\\phi$ over $[a,b]$, $J$ the integral of $\\phi$ over $[a,b]$,  and $H(x)$ the RHS of the equality you want to prove. Assume that $\\phi$ is nonnegative and $G$ is nondecreasing, the other cases being similar. Since $G(a)\\le G(t)\\le G(b)$ and $\\phi(t)\\ge0$ for every $t$ in $[a,b]$, $G(a)\\phi(t)\\le G(t)\\phi(t)\\le G(b)\\phi(t)$ for every $t$, hence $G(a)J\\le I\\le G(b)J$. The function $x\\mapsto H(x)$ is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$, $H(a)=G(b)J\\ge I$ and $H(b)=G(a)J\\le I$, hence by the intermediate value theorem there exists $x$ in $[a,b]$ such that $H(x)=I$. (No continuity of $G$ is required.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about two different forms of the second mean value theorem for integration and wants to know if they are equivalent. The key points mentioned are the continuity conditions on G and the position of x in the interval [a, b].\n\nFirst, I need to recall the standard statement of the second mean value theorem for integration. The version on Wikipedia, as mentioned, might have different continuity requirements. The user provided another version where G is monotonic (but not necessarily continuous) and ϕ is integrable. The conclusion is that there exists an x in [a, b] such that the integral of G(t)ϕ(t) dt from a to b equals G(a) times the integral of ϕ from a to x plus G(b) times the integral from x to b.\n\nThe user is pointing out that in some references, the theorem might use G(a+) and G(b−) instead of G(a) and G(b), especially if G isn't continuous at the endpoints. They're wondering if these two forms are equivalent, considering that G(a) and G(a+) could be different.\n\nSo, to check equivalence, I need to see if assuming G is right-continuous at a and left-continuous at b (or not) affects the conclusion. The integral ∫G(t)ϕ(t) dt shouldn't depend on the values of G at individual points since changing a function at a single point doesn't affect the integral. However, when expressing the result using G(a) and G(b), if G has jumps at a or b, using G(a) vs G(a+) would change the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nWait, but the theorem as stated in the problem doesn't require continuity. So maybe the version where G is monotonic (without continuity) uses the one-sided limits, but the user's version uses G(a) and G(b) directly. The user is asking if these two versions are equivalent.\n\nTo prove equivalence, perhaps we can adjust the point x to account for the jumps. For example, if G has a jump at a, then using G(a+) instead of G(a) would require a different x. But since x is allowed to be anywhere in [a, b], maybe we can compensate by shifting x slightly. However, the exact proof would require handling the cases where G is increasing or decreasing and considering the left and right limits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two versions are equivalent under the integral's insensitivity to points. If G is monotonic, it has at most countably many discontinuities, so modifying it at those points (like using G(a+) instead of G(a)) would create a function that's equal almost everywhere, hence the integral remains the same. Therefore, the two forms would be equivalent because the integral on the left doesn't care about those points, and the right-hand side can adjust x accordingly.\n\nBut I need to structure this into the required format. The assumptions here are about the properties of G and ϕ. Let's list each assumption line by line:\n\n- G: [a, b] → ℝ is a monotonic function.\n- ϕ: [a, b] → ℝ is an integrable function.\n- The problem is to prove that there exists x in [a, b] such that the integral equals G(a) times integral of ϕ from a to x plus G(b) times integral from x to b.\n\nThe user also mentions that another version might use one-sided limits, but in the given problem statement, it's using G(a) and G(b) directly. The question is whether these two forms are equivalent. So the problem is to show equivalence between the two versions, possibly under some conditions.\n\nBut wait, the original question says: \"I am wondering if anyone can give me a proof that the two are equivalent.\" So the problem is to prove that the two forms (using G(a)/G(b) vs G(a+)/G(b−)) are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G: [a, b] → ℝ is a monotonic function.\n- ϕ: [a, b] → ℝ is an integrable function.\n- The two forms of the theorem differ in whether they use G(a) and G(b) or their one-sided limits.\n\nProblem: Prove that the two forms of the second mean value theorem for integration are equivalent, i.e., that using G(a) and G(b) versus G(a+) and G(b−) does not affect the existence of x in [a, b] satisfying the integral equation.\n\nBut the original problem states the user's version as the theorem with G(a) and G(b), and the other version (possibly with one-sided limits). The user wants a proof that these two are equivalent.\n\nHowever, the exact assumptions for each version might differ. For example, the Wikipedia version might require G to be of bounded variation or have continuity, while the other reference allows G to be monotonic without continuity. So, to structure this properly, the assumptions should list all conditions given in each version. But the user hasn't provided the exact statement from Wikipedia, only that it's different in terms of where x lies and one-sided limits.\n\nWait, the user's own version is the one with G monotonic, ϕ integrable, and x in [a, b], while the other form (presumably Wikipedia's) might have x in (a, b) or require continuity. The user is confused about whether the continuity affects the integral's value and if the two statements are equivalent.\n\nSo to format this correctly, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG: [a, b] → ℝ is a monotonic function,\nϕ: [a, b] → ℝ is an integrable function,\nThere exists x in [a, b] such that ∫_a^b G(t)ϕ(t) dt = G(a)∫_a^x ϕ(t) dt + G(b)∫_x^b ϕ(t) dt,\nAnother version of the theorem states the same with G(a+) and G(b−) instead of G(a) and G(b),\nThe integral ∫_a^b G(t)ϕ(t) dt is unaffected by the choice of G(a) vs G(a+) and G(b) vs G(b−).\n\nProblem: Prove that the two forms of the second mean value theorem for integration are equivalent, i.e., that the existence of x in [a, b] satisfying the equation with G(a) and G(b) implies the existence with G(a+) and G(b−), and vice versa.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, the problem is to show that under the conditions of G being monotonic and ϕ integrable, the two versions (with or without one-sided limits) are equivalent because the integral is unaffected by the points where G has jumps, and the value of x can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nHowever, to fit the format strictly, the problem statement should encapsulate the user's query. The user's problem is: Given the two forms of the second mean value theorem, one using G(a) and G(b) with x in [a, b], and another possibly using one-sided limits and x in (a, b), prove that these two statements are equivalent.\n\nBut the user specifically wrote: \"I am wondering if anyone can give me a proof that the two are equivalent.\" So the problem is to show the equivalence between the two versions, assuming the necessary conditions on G and ϕ.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G: [a, b] → ℝ is a monotonic function,\n- ϕ: [a, b] → ℝ is an integrable function,\n- One form of the theorem states there exists x ∈ [a, b] such that ∫_a^b Gϕ = G(a)∫_a^x ϕ + G(b)∫_x^b ϕ,\n- Another form of the theorem uses G(a+) and G(b−) instead of G(a) and G(b),\n- The integral ∫_a^b G(t)ϕ(t) dt remains the same regardless of using G(a) or G(a+) since points have measure zero.\n\nProblem: Prove that the two forms of the second mean value theorem for integration are equivalent.\n\nBut the user's exact problem is in the question: \"I am wondering if anyone can give me a proof that the two are equivalent.\" So, the problem is to prove the equivalence between the two versions of the theorem, one using G(a) and G(b) with x in [a, b], and the other using G(a+) and G(b−) with x possibly in (a, b), under the given assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture this. However, the user's original problem statement in the question is a bit more detailed. Let me re-examine:\n\nOriginal question states the form they read is:\n\nG is monotonic, ϕ integrable, then there exists x in [a, b] such that ∫a^b Gϕ = G(a)∫a^x ϕ + G(b)∫x^b ϕ.\n\nThe user contrasts this with the Wikipedia version, which might differ in where x lies (maybe in (a,b)) and whether to use one-sided limits. The user thinks that the integral shouldn't depend on G's continuity at the endpoints, but G(a) vs G(a+) could differ.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the two versions are equivalent, considering the possible difference in using G(a) vs G(a+) and the location of x.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be the conditions given in each theorem, but since the user only provides one form explicitly, perhaps the assumptions are those of the user's version, and the problem is to show equivalence with the other form.\n\nBut since the user wants to structure the problem as per the example, the assistant's task is to filter the original question and present it in the Assumption/Problem format.\n\nOriginal problem mentions:\n\n- Two forms of the second mean value theorem for integration.\n- The user's version: G is monotonic, ϕ integrable, x ∈ [a,b], uses G(a) and G(b).\n- Wikipedia's version: possibly different continuity conditions (maybe G is right-continuous at a, left-continuous at b) and x ∈ (a,b).\n- The user's question is whether these two forms are equivalent.\n\nThus, the assumptions to list are the conditions from both versions, but since the user hasn't provided Wikipedia's exact statement, we can only infer based on their description. The key points are:\n\n1. G is monotonic.\n2. ϕ is integrable.\n3. The two forms differ in using G(a)/G(b) versus G(a+)/G(b−).\n4. The integral ∫Gϕ should be the same regardless of these differences because points don't affect integrals.\n5. The theorem's conclusion holds for some x in [a,b] or (a,b).\n\nBut to structure the problem, we need to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nThus, assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $G: [a, b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a monotonic function.\n- $\\phi: [a, b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is an integrable function.\n- The first form of the theorem states there exists $x \\in [a, b]$ such that $\\int_a^b G(t)\\phi(t)dt = G(a)\\int_a^x \\phi(t)dt + G(b)\\int_x^b \\phi(t)dt$.\n- The second form of the theorem uses $G(a+)$ and $G(b−)$ instead of $G(a)$ and $G(b)$.\n- The integral $\\int_a^b G(t)\\phi(t)dt$ is unaffected by the values of $G$ at individual points.\n\nProblem: Prove that the two forms of the second mean value theorem for integration are equivalent.\n\nHowever, the problem is more specifically about the equivalence when considering the use of G(a) vs G(a+) and G(b) vs G(b−), and the position of x. The user is also asking for a proof of this equivalence.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement is to show that if one form holds (with G(a) and G(b)), then the other form (with G(a+) and G(b−)) also holds, and vice versa, under the given assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final structured problem should capture this.",
