    "Content": "About the classification of continuous group morphisms from $(\\mathbb{S},\\times)$ the circle of elements of module $1$ in $\\mathbb{C}$ to $\\text{GL}_n (\\mathbb{R})$ which is a well known problem, I prove it without reference and had a completely different proof than the usual proof using (I believe) classification of morphisms from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\text{GL}_n ( \\mathbb{R})$ with exponentials. EDIT: I realized this is a well known result for student that aim the ENS (French very hard to get math school), I have the original reference , but it is in French (sorry guys) here are all the references that I know about S. Francinou, H. Gianella, S. Nicolas, Exercices de mathématiques, Oraux X-ENS, Algèbre 2, 2e édition, Cassini.\nExercise 4.29 page 251. A PDF written by a fellow student that does the exact same proof (it follows from the book). However, I did not find any reference that use my proof or something analogous. My question is (since it has very probably been done) do you have one reference? The proof uses various mechanisms and I find it interesting. If my question is off-topic, please tell me, I'll close the subject. Here is the theorem: Theorem :\nLet $\\varphi: \\mathbb{S} \\longrightarrow \\text{GL}_n (\\mathbb{R})$ be a continuous group morphism, then there exist $r \\leqslant \\frac{n}{2}$ , $m_1, \\dots m_r \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ , $P \\in \\text{GL}_n (\\mathbb{R})$ such that: $$\\forall \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\qquad \\varphi(e^{i\\theta}) =\nP\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nR(m_1 \\theta) \\\\\n& \\ddots \\\\\n&& R(m_r \\theta) \\\\\n&&&I_{n-2r} \\end{pmatrix}\nP^{-1}$$ With $R(\\theta)$ the rotation matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) &\\sin(\\theta)\\\\ -\\sin(\\theta) & \\cos (\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}$ Some intuition about the theorem in itself: $\\varphi$ stabilizes planes in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and rotates them as you would rotate $\\mathbb{R}^2$ , the more you move on the circle, the more the planes rotate. For the rest of the space, it has to be trivial on it. Here is the proof in multiple steps: Prove that every continuous group endomorphism $\\varphi$ of $\\mathbb{S}$ is of the form $$z \\longmapsto z^m$$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ . To do so, I apply the lifting path theorem to $t \\mapsto \\varphi(e^{it})$ and get a continuous endomorphism of $\\mathbb{R}$ , $\\phi$ . These morphisms are well known and of the form $t \\mapsto at$ . A quick study gives $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ which finishes the proof. We get into the deep and fix a goal: use codiagonalisation on the image. For that we already have commutativity since the source group is abelian, we just need to show diagonalisation. Let us take $z \\in \\mathbb{S}$ of finite order, i.e. $$z \\in \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}^*} U_n = U_\\infty .$$ Then there exist $n$ for which $z^n = 1$ , so $\\varphi(z)^n = I_n$ is idempotent, thus diagonalisable over $\\mathbb{C}$ with spectrum in $\\mathbb{S}$ . So the image of $U_\\infty$ by $\\varphi$ is codiagonalisable, which means there exists $ Q \\in \\text{GL}_n ( \\mathbb{C} ) $ such that $$ \\varphi_{ | U_\\infty } (z) = Q \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\tilde{\\lambda_1} (z) \\\\\n& \\ddots \\\\\n&& \\tilde{\\lambda_n} (z)\n\\end{pmatrix} Q^{-1}. $$ with $\\tilde{\\lambda_i}$ continuous (hence uniformly continuous) functions from $ U_\\infty $ to $ \\mathbb{S} $ . Thanks to the theorem of extension for uniformly continuous mappings, we extend each $\\lambda$ and $\\varphi_{|\\mathbb{U}_\\infty}$ and by unicity, we obtain: $$\\varphi (z) = Q\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda_1 (z) \\\\\n& \\ddots \\\\\n&& \\lambda_n (z)\n\\end{pmatrix} Q^{-1}.$$ Obviously, the $\\lambda_i$ are continuous endormorphism of the circle, thus there exists $k_1, \\dots , k_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $$\\varphi (z) = Q\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nz^{k_1} \\\\\n& \\ddots \\\\\n&& z^{k_n}\n\\end{pmatrix} Q^{-1}.$$ By a quick study of the characteristic polynomial of $\\varphi \\left( e^{i \\frac{1}{ \\max_{k_i \\neq 0} k_i}} \\right) $ which does not depend on the field extension thus it has real coefficients, we can reorganize the $k_i$ in $(m_1, -m_1, m_2, -m_2,\\dots, m_r,-m_r, 0, \\dots 0)$ . It is common knowledge that these two matrices are $\\mathbb{C}$ -conjuguate $$\\begin{pmatrix}\ne^{i\\theta} & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{-i \\theta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\sim\nR(\\theta)$$ We get then $$ \\varphi(e^{i\\theta}) =\nP'\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nR(m_1 \\theta) \\\\\n& \\ddots \\\\\n&& R(m_r \\theta) \\\\\n&&&I_{n-2r} \\end{pmatrix}\nP'^{-1}$$ with $P' \\in \\text{GL}_n ( \\mathbb{C} ) $ , but two real $\\mathbb{C}$ -conjuguate matrices are $\\mathbb{R}$ -conjuguate, which proves the result.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In more \"traditional\" representation-theoretic language, the first three steps is the classification of $\\mathbb C$ -representation of $S^1$ : Proposition. Let $V$ be a smooth finite-dimensional representation of $S^1$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb C$ . Then $V$ decomposes as the direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, every irreducible representation of $S^1$ is of the form $V_n=\\mathbb C$ , where $z\\in S^1$ acts as $z^n$ , for some $n\\in\\mathbb Z$ . In other words, every finite-dimensional representation of $S^1$ is of the form $\\bigoplus_{i\\in\\mathbb Z}V_i^{m_i}$ , for some integers $m_i\\ge0$ . The usual proof relies on integration over $S^1$ , and mimics the classical proof for finite groups. Your proof looks new (!), and it would be interesting to see if the argument generalizes to arbitrary compact Lie groups. In general I believe the finite order elements still are a dense subset, but they no longer commute with each other, so the argument is more complicated (so the integration technique may be simpler there). The next part is a \"Galois-descent\" for such representations: Proposition. A representation $\\bigoplus_{n\\in I}V_n$ descends to a representation over $\\mathbb R$ if and only if $m_i=m_{-i}$ for each $i\\in\\mathbb Z$ . For this part, your proof looks pretty much like the standard argument. The generalization to arbitrary compact Lie groups would involve a calculation of Frobenius-Schur indicators. For the theory for finite groups (which extends readily to compact groups), see Conrad's notes .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The user wants me to extract the assumptions and the problem statement in a specific format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe question is about classifying continuous group morphisms from the circle group S (complex numbers with module 1) to GL_n(R). The user mentions a theorem they proved without references and wants a reference for their proof method. However, the task here isn't to answer the reference request but to structure the problem as per the given example.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is stated clearly.\n\nIn the original problem, the key elements are:\n\n1. The morphism φ: S → GL_n(R) is continuous.\n2. It's a group morphism.\n3. The goal is to prove that φ can be expressed in a specific form involving rotation matrices and an identity block, conjugated by some matrix P.\n\nThe assumptions should capture the conditions on φ. The problem is the theorem statement.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions for the theorem are the properties of φ: continuity, being a group morphism, and the structure of S (circle group). But according to the example, each assumption is a single condition on one object. So the theorem's hypotheses are:\n\n- φ is a continuous group morphism.\n- φ maps from S to GL_n(R).\n\nBut in the problem statement, these are the given conditions. The user's theorem is under these assumptions.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\nφ: S → GL_n(R) is a continuous group morphism.\n\nBut the example formatted each assumption line by line. Since each line is one condition on one object, maybe split them:\n\nφ: S → GL_n(R) is a continuous function.\n\nφ is a group morphism.\n\nWait, but in the original theorem statement, it's given that φ is a continuous group morphism. So each part is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is a continuous function from S to GL_n(R),\nφ is a group morphism.\n\nBut S is defined as the circle group with elements of module 1 in C. Maybe include that as another assumption? Wait, S is part of the problem's setup, not an assumption on φ. So perhaps the problem is about morphisms from S (which is already defined as the circle group) to GL_n(R), and the assumptions are the continuity and being a morphism.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were on the variable n (integer and divisible by 7). So here, the assumptions would be about φ: it's a function from S to GL_n(R), it's continuous, and it's a group morphism. Each of these can be separate lines.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the theorem starts with \"Let φ: S → GL_n(R) be a continuous group morphism...\", so the assumptions are exactly those two: continuity and group morphism. But since S is part of the problem's context, maybe it's not an assumption but part of the problem's setup.\n\nWait, the problem is \"Prove that φ can be written in the form...\", given that it's a continuous group morphism. So the assumptions for the problem are the conditions on φ. Therefore, the assumptions should list:\n\n- φ: S → GL_n(R) is a continuous group morphism.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single property. So maybe split into:\n\nφ is a function from S to GL_n(R),\n\nφ is continuous,\n\nφ is a group morphism.\n\nBut \"group morphism\" implies that φ preserves the group operation, which is a single property. However, in the example, each line was a separate condition. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that example seems to have incorrect assumptions because the original problem didn't require n divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake there. Wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error in the example. But perhaps the example was a typo or a mistake. However, the user is using that example as a guide, so I have to follow the format even if the example has inconsistencies.\n\nBut given that, the user's example splits the assumptions into separate lines, each with one condition. So for the current problem, the theorem's hypotheses are:\n\n- φ is a continuous group morphism from S to GL_n(R).\n\nBut to split into separate lines:\n\nφ: S → GL_n(R) is a continuous function,\n\nφ is a group morphism.\n\nBut \"group morphism\" is a property of φ. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nφ: S → GL_n(R) is a continuous function,\nφ is a group morphism.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist integers r ≤ n/2, m_1, ..., m_r ∈ Z, and P ∈ GL_n(R) such that for all θ ∈ R,\nφ(e^{iθ}) = P diag(R(m_1θ), ..., R(m_rθ), I_{n-2r}) P^{-1},\nwhere R(θ) is the rotation matrix.\n\nBut need to write the problem in the required format. The problem statement is the theorem. So the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are the conditions on φ, and the problem is the conclusion of the theorem.",
