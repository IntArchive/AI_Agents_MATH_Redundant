    "Content": "http://vapour-trail.blogspot.com/2006/03/brief-explanation-of-taylor-series-via.html provides an intuitive derivation of Taylor expansions from the mean value theorem that confuses me. The derivation is described as follow. By the mean value theorem we have (assuming that $f$ has the differentiability properties requires for an infinite Taylor expansion) $$f(x+\\Delta)=f(x)+\\Delta\\cdot\\frac{df}{dx}(\\xi_1),\\quad x<\\xi_1<x+\\Delta \\tag4$$ Then one can reapply the mean value theorem to the first derivative in equation 4 to get \\begin{array} { l } \\displaystyle { \\frac { d f } { d x } \\left( \\xi _ { 1 } \\right) = \\frac { d f } { d x } ( x ) + \\left( \\xi _ { 1 } - x \\right) \\cdot \\frac { d ^ { 2 } f } { d x ^ { 2 } } \\left( \\xi _ { 2 } \\right) \\quad ; x < \\xi _ { 2 } < \\xi _ { 1 } } \\\\\n\\displaystyle{ \\Delta _ { 2 } \\equiv \\left( \\xi _ { 1 } - x \\right) } \\\\\n\\displaystyle{ \\frac { d f } { d x } \\left( \\xi _ { 1 } \\right) = \\frac { d f } { d x } ( x ) + \\Delta _ { 2 } \\cdot \\frac { d ^ { 2 } f } { d x ^ { 2 } } \\left( \\xi _ { 2 } \\right) } \\\\[2ex]\n\\displaystyle f ( x + \\Delta ) = f ( x ) + \\Delta \\cdot \\frac { d f } { d x } \\left( \\xi _ { 1 } \\right) \\,\\,\\text{ from equation (4)}\\\\\n\\displaystyle { f ( x + \\Delta ) = f ( x ) + \\Delta \\left[ \\frac { d f } { d x } ( x ) + \\Delta _ { 2 } \\cdot \\frac { d ^ { 2 } f } { d x ^ { 2 } } \\left( \\xi _ { 2 } \\right) \\right] } \\\\\n\\displaystyle { f ( x + \\Delta ) = f ( x ) + \\Delta \\cdot \\frac { d f } { d x } ( x ) + \\Delta \\cdot \\Delta _ { 2 } \\cdot \\frac { d ^ { 2 } f } { d x ^ { 2 } } \\left( \\xi _ { 2 } \\right) }\n\\end{array} Repeating the process indefinitely yields $$\nf ( x + \\Delta ) = f ( x ) + \\Delta \\cdot \\frac { d f } { d x } ( x ) + \\Delta \\cdot \\Delta _ { 2 } \\cdot \\frac { d ^ { 2 } f } { d x ^ { 2 } } ( x ) + \\Delta \\cdot \\Delta _ { 2 } \\cdot \\Delta _ { 3 } \\cdot \\frac { d ^ { 3 } f } { d x ^ { 3 } } ( x ) + \\ldots, \\\\\nf(x+\\Delta)=\\sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \\infty } \\left[ \\left( \\prod _ { p = 1 } ^ { n } \\Delta _ { p } \\right) \\cdot \\frac { d ^ { n } f } { d x ^ { n } } ( x ) \\right], \\quad \\Delta_0=1 \\,\\,\\&\\,\\, \\Delta_1=\\Delta\n$$ Now, as noted by the author, the last equation would be equivalent to an infinite Taylor series if we had $$\\Delta_p=\\frac{\\Delta_1}{p},\\quad \\forall p\\in N\\tag 8.$$ The author writes \"Unfortunately, equation 8 is not as easy to derive/proof as its simplicity may otherwise suggest. As such, this article would end here.\" Someone asked for hints in the comments but the author never answered. Could anyone provide a proof of (equation 8)? It seems weird to me. For instance we have $\\xi_1 = x + \\Delta_2$ . Equation 8 says $\\Delta_2 = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$ . So $\\xi_1 = x + \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$ . Wouldn't that imply that for every $f$ (again having the required properties) and for every interval $[x,x+\\Delta]$ in the domain of $f$ , the mean value is always half way through the interval (i.e. the derivative at the half point in the interval is equal the the mean derivative over the interval)? This is obviously false (right?) so where is my mistake (if any)?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Equation (8) is certainly not true. A simple counterexample is $f(t)=t^3, x=0, \\Delta=1,$ because we get $f'(\\xi_1)=3\\xi_1^2=f(1)-f(0)=1, \\xi_1={1\\over \\sqrt3}$ and hence $\\Delta_2=\\xi_1={1\\over \\sqrt3}\\neq {\\Delta \\over 2}.$ Also Taylor's Theorem doesn't say that an infinitely differentiable function necessarily coincides with its Taylor series. All Taylor's Theorem does is give a measure for the error made by estimating a function with its $n^{th}$ Taylor polynomial.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking about deriving equation (8) from the given Taylor expansion approach using the mean value theorem (MVT). The equation in question is Δ_p = Δ₁ / p for all p in natural numbers, which supposedly allows the iterative MVT application to become the standard Taylor series. The confusion arises because if Δ₂ = Δ/2, then ξ₁ = x + Δ/2, which would imply the mean value is always at the midpoint, which isn't generally true. So, where's the mistake or how is this justified?\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the Taylor expansion is derived via MVT as presented in the blog. Let me parse the steps outlined:\n\n1. Start with MVT on f(x + Δ): f(x + Δ) = f(x) + Δ f’(ξ₁), where ξ₁ is in (x, x + Δ).\n2. Then apply MVT to f’(ξ₁): f’(ξ₁) = f’(x) + (ξ₁ - x) f''(ξ₂), where ξ₂ is in (x, ξ₁). Let Δ₂ = ξ₁ - x.\n3. Substitute back into the original equation: f(x + Δ) = f(x) + Δ [f’(x) + Δ₂ f''(ξ₂)] = f(x) + Δ f’(x) + Δ Δ₂ f''(ξ₂).\n4. Repeat this process indefinitely, each time applying MVT to the highest derivative term, introducing new Δ_p = ξ_{p-1} - x, where each ξ_p is in (x, ξ_{p-1}).\n\nThe resulting expansion is an infinite series with terms involving products of Δ_p and derivatives at x. The claim is that if Δ_p = Δ₁ / p, then this becomes the standard Taylor series. But the user is confused because Δ₂ = Δ/2 would fix ξ₁ at the midpoint, which isn't always the case in MVT.\n\nWait, but in the standard Taylor series, the remainder term involves higher-order derivatives at some intermediate point, not necessarily the midpoint. So how does this approach reconcile that? Maybe the key here is that the author is assuming a specific choice of intermediate points that allows the product of Δ_p terms to form the factorial denominators in Taylor series. However, MVT only guarantees the existence of some point, not a specific one. So imposing Δ_p = Δ/p might not hold in general unless there's a specific condition or constraint.\n\nLet me think. If we recursively apply MVT, each step introduces a new Δ_p. For instance, first step: Δ₁ = Δ (given). Then Δ₂ = ξ₁ - x, which from MVT is some value between 0 and Δ. But the author is saying that for the expansion to match Taylor, we need Δ_p = Δ₁ / p. For example, Δ₂ = Δ/2, Δ₃ = Δ/3, etc. But in reality, each Δ_p depends on the previous ξ_{p-1}, which is arbitrary depending on the function. So unless there's a specific reason why all these Δ_p would be exactly Δ/p, this seems restrictive.\n\nThe user's confusion is that if Δ₂ = Δ/2, then ξ₁ is fixed at x + Δ/2, which would mean that for every function and interval, the MVT point is the midpoint, which is false. For example, for f(x) = e^x, the derivative at any point is the same, so the MVT point can be anywhere. But for a quadratic function, maybe the midpoint is where the derivative equals the average rate? Wait, no. For f(x) = x², over [a, b], the MVT gives ξ = (a + b)/2, the midpoint. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, f(x) = x²: f’(ξ) = (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a) => 2ξ = (b² - a²)/(b - a) = b + a, so ξ = (a + b)/2. So for f(x) = x², the MVT point is indeed the midpoint. Interesting. For f(x) = x³, let's check. Suppose interval [0, Δ]. Then f’(ξ) = (Δ³ - 0)/Δ = Δ². But f’(ξ) = 3ξ², so 3ξ² = Δ² => ξ = Δ/√3, which is not the midpoint. So in this case, the MVT point is not the midpoint. Hence, the user is correct that assuming ξ₁ is the midpoint (i.e., Δ₂ = Δ/2) would be invalid for general functions.\n\nTherefore, the author's derivation must have an error in assuming that Δ_p can be taken as Δ/p, leading to equation (8). However, the user is asking for a proof of equation (8), which seems impossible given that MVT points vary depending on the function. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the process.\n\nWait, maybe the author is not applying the standard MVT but a different version? Let's check the steps again. The first application is standard: f(x + Δ) = f(x) + Δ f’(ξ₁). Then f’(ξ₁) is expanded as f’(x) + (ξ₁ - x) f''(ξ₂). If we continue this, each derivative term is expanded using MVT, leading to higher-order terms. The coefficients involve products of Δ_p where each Δ_p = ξ_{p-1} - x. The author then states that if Δ_p = Δ₁ / p, then the expansion becomes Taylor. But how can we enforce Δ_p = Δ/p? That would require each ξ_{p} to be at x + Δ - (Δ/p), but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is a heuristic to motivate the Taylor series rather than a rigorous proof. The author might be suggesting that by recursively applying MVT and assuming each step's increment is a fraction of the previous, you get the factorial terms. But in reality, the rigorous Taylor series comes from the integral form of the remainder or using the Lagrange remainder term, which involves (Δ^n)/n! times the nth derivative at some point. But the MVT approach here is trying to build it iteratively.\n\nPerhaps the key is that in the limit as the number of terms goes to infinity, the Δ_p terms average out to Δ/p? That might not hold, but maybe there's a combinatorial argument. For example, when you repeatedly apply MVT, the product of the Δ_p terms could accumulate to Δ^k /k! if each Δ_p is Δ/(p). Let's see:\n\nIf Δ₁ = Δ, Δ₂ = Δ/2, Δ₃ = Δ/3, ..., then the product Δ₁Δ₂Δ₃...Δ_n = Δ^n /n!.\n\nYes, because Δ₁ * Δ₂ * ... * Δ_n = Δ * (Δ/2) * (Δ/3) * ... * (Δ/n) = Δ^n / (1*2*3*...*n) = Δ^n /n!.\n\nSo, if each Δ_p = Δ/p, then the product terms give the coefficients of the Taylor series. But the problem is that in reality, each Δ_p depends on the function's behavior and isn't fixed. So the author's equation (8) seems to be an ansatz rather than a derived result. Therefore, the answer would be that equation (8) isn't generally valid for all functions; it's an assumption that allows the MVT expansion to match the Taylor series, but such a condition can't be proven under the standard MVT. Hence, the author's method is heuristic and doesn't constitute a rigorous proof of the Taylor expansion.",
