    "Content": "Prove that for all integers $n$, $n \\geq 1$,\n  $$1 + 3 + 5 + \\cdots + (2n - 1) = n\\cdot n$$ How would I go about proving this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(1) Proof using the \"method of gauss\": $$\\begin{eqnarray*} 2(1 + 3+ 5 + \\ldots (2n-1)) &=&\\big[ 1 + (2n-1)\\big] + \\big[3 + (2n-3)\\big] + \\ldots + \\big[ (2n-1) + 1\\big] \\\\\n&=& \\underbrace{2n + 2n + \\ldots + 2n}_{\\text{$n$ times}} \\\\\n&= &2n(n). \\end{eqnarray*}$$ Therefore it follows that $(1 + 3 + \\ldots (2n-1)) = n\\times n.$ (2) Proof by induction: Let $P(n)$ be the statement: \"For all positive integers $n$, $1 + 3 + \\ldots + (2n-1) = n^2$.\" For $n=1$ clearly $(2 \\cdot 1) - 1 = 1\\cdot 1$ so that $P(1)$ is true. So suppose the result holds for $n=k$, i.e. $P(k)$ is true. Since $P(k)$ is true, this means that we have the following equality when $n=k$: $$1+ 3 + \\ldots + (2k-1) = k^2.$$ If you add $2k+1$ to both sides of this equation, you get that $$ \\begin{eqnarray*} 1+ 3 + \\ldots +(2k-1) + (2k+1) &=& k\\cdot k + (2k+1) \\\\\n&=& k^2 + 2k + 1 \\\\\n&=& (k+1)(k+1) \\end{eqnarray*}$$ showing that the result holds for $n=k+1$, i.e. $P(k+1)$ is true. Therefore by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, $1 + 3 + \\ldots + (2n-1) = n\\cdot n$ for all positive integers $n$. (3) Suppose you only knew that the sum of $n$ consecutive integers is $n(n+1)/2$.\nThen $$\\begin{eqnarray*}1 +2 + \\ldots + 2n &=& \\frac{2n(2n+1)}{2}\\\\\n\\implies 1 + 3 + \\ldots + (2n-1) &=& n(2n+1) - 2(1 + \\ldots + n) \\\\\n&=& 2n^2 + n - 2\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right) \\\\\n&=& 2n^2 + n - n^2 - n \\\\\n&=& n^2. \\end{eqnarray*}$$ (4) Proof using telescoping sums (idea by Bill Dubuque): $$\\begin{eqnarray*} \\sum_{k=1}^n 2k-1 &=& \\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 - (k-1)^2 \\\\\n&=& (1 - 0) + (2^2 -1 ) + \\ldots +  n^2 - (n-1)^ 2\\\\\n&=& 1 + (-1 + 2^2) + (-2^2 + 3^2) + \\ldots + (-(n-2)^2 + (n-1)^2) + (-(n-1)^2 + n^2)) \\\\\n&=& n^2.\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$ (5) Proof by method of differences (brute force): Let $a_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n 2k-1$. Then we see that $a_1 =1 $, $a_2 = 4$, $a_3 = 9$, etc. Now we look at the first differences $4 - 1 = 3$, $9- 4 = 5$, $16 - 9 = 7$, etc. Then when we look at the second difference, notice that it is constant: $5-3 = 2$, $7- 5= 2$, etc so we conjecture that $$\\sum_{k=1}^n 2k - 1 = an^2 + bn + c$$ where $a,b,c$ are constants to be determined. Plugging in $n = 1,2,3$ gives us a $3 \\times 3$ linear system to solve, namely the linear system $$\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 9 & 3  & 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 9 \\end{array}\\right].$$ The determinant of the coefficient matrix is $$\\begin{eqnarray*} 1(2-3) - 1(4-9) + 1(12 - 81) &=& -1 + 5 - 69 \\\\\n&\\neq& 0 \\end{eqnarray*}$$\n so we have a unique solution. It is easy to see that $a = 1, b= 0, c=0$ is a solution to the linear system above. By the previous line, it is the only solution so we are done. (6) Proof by a direct bash: Suppose you only knew that the sum of the first $n$ integers is $n(n+1)/2$. Then $$\\begin{eqnarray*} \\sum_{k=1}^n 2k - 1 &=& \\bigg(2\\sum_{k=1}^n k \\bigg) - \\sum_{k=1}^n 1 \\\\\n&=& 2\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right) - n\\\\\n&=& n^2 + n -n\\\\\n&=& n^2\n\\end{eqnarray*}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that the \"Assumption\" section lists each condition applied to one object. The original problem here is about proving that the sum of odd numbers up to 2n-1 equals n squared. \n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The problem states \"for all integers n, n ≥ 1\". So the assumptions here are that n is an integer and n is greater than or equal to 1. Each of these should be separate points under Assumption. The problem itself is to prove the equation.\n\nWait, the example had an assumption about divisibility by 7, but in this problem, there's no such condition except n being an integer and n ≥1. So the assumptions are straightforward. Let me make sure there are no hidden conditions. The sum is from 1 to 2n-1, which are the first n odd numbers. The problem doesn't mention any other constraints, so the assumptions are just n being an integer and n being at least 1. That should be it. So I need to list each assumption line by line. Then state the problem as proving the sum equals n squared.",
