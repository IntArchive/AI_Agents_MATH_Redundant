    "Content": "Let $D^n$ denote the closed unit ball in $\\Bbb R^n$. In multiple sources proving Brown's generalized Schoenflies theorem (including a version in the original paper), the following consequence of Brouwer's invariance of dimension is stated without proof. If $f: D^n \\rightarrow D^n$ with only one non-singleton inverse set $f^{-1}(y)$ disjoint from the boundary, then $y$ is in the interior of the image of $f$. I am at a loss as to how to go from invariance of dimension to this. EDIT: I just went through the proof of generalized Schoenflies in Bing's book, and he doesn't makes use of this fact. I'm still interested how one proves this from invariance of dimension (or using similar homological techniques as such).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The invariance of domain theorem states that if $U$ is an open domain of $\\mathbb R^n$ and $f:U\\to\\mathbb R^n$ is continuous and injective, then $f$ is open and in fact $f$ is an homeomorphism.  See here . Now we come to the question. By continuity, $f^{-1}(y)$ is closed. Let $U=int(D^n)\\setminus f^{-1}(y)$. $U$ is not empty otherwise $f(D^n)=y$ and therefore $f^{-1}(y)$ contains the boundary of $D^n$. So $f(U)$ is open and homeomorphic to $U$. By definition, there is a sequence $u_n\\in U$ so that $u_n\\to f^{-1}(y)$. This provides a sequence $z_n=f(u_n)$ in the interior of the image of $f$ so that $z_n\\to y$. If $y$ is not an interior point, there is a second sequence of points\n$w_n\\to y$ not in the image of $f$. Let $\\gamma_n$ be an arc between $z_n$ and $w_n$ wich do not contains $y$. $f^{-1}(\\gamma)$ must contain a point of $\\partial D^n$. So we have that there is $x_n\\in\\partial D^n$ so that $f(x_n)\\to y$. $x_n$ has an accumulation point $x\\in\\partial D^n$ and by continuity $f(x)=y$. Thus, if $y$ is not an interior point, then $f^{-1}(y)$ intersects the boundary.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. So the user provided a question from Math Stack Exchange about a map from the n-dimensional disk D^n to itself. The main goal is to structure the problem into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the given format. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The original problem mentions several things: D^n is the closed unit ball in R^n. The function f maps D^n to D^n. There's only one non-singleton inverse set f^{-1}(y), which is disjoint from the boundary. The conclusion to prove is that y is in the interior of the image of f.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The domain and codomain of f are both D^n, the closed unit ball in R^n. So that's an assumption about f: it's a map from D^n to D^n.\n2. The function f has only one non-singleton inverse set. That means there exists a unique y in D^n such that f^{-1}(y) has more than one point, and all other preimages f^{-1}(z) for z ≠ y are singletons or empty.\n3. This non-singleton inverse set f^{-1}(y) is disjoint from the boundary of D^n. The boundary here would be the sphere S^{n-1}, so f^{-1}(y) is contained in the interior of D^n.\n4. The problem is to show that y is in the interior of the image of f. So the conclusion is about the location of y in the codomain.\n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"with only one non-singleton inverse set f^{-1}(y) disjoint from the boundary\". So the \"disjoint from the boundary\" applies to the inverse set, meaning f^{-1}(y) ∩ ∂D^n = empty. So that's another condition: the preimage of y does not intersect the boundary of the disk.\n\nNow, the user mentioned that this is supposed to be structured into assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So each bullet point in the assumption section should be a single condition.\n\nSo listing the assumptions:\n\n- f: D^n → D^n is a map (from the closed unit ball to itself)\n- There exists a unique y ∈ D^n such that f^{-1}(y) is a non-singleton set (i.e., has more than one point)\n- The set f^{-1}(y) is disjoint from the boundary of D^n (i.e., f^{-1}(y) ⊂ interior(D^n))\n- (Possibly, although not explicitly stated, f is continuous? The original problem is in the context of Brouwer's invariance of dimension and Brown's theorem, which typically involve continuous maps. But the problem statement as given doesn't specify continuity. Wait, the original question mentions \"maps from D^n to D^n\", and in topology, \"map\" usually means continuous function. So maybe continuity is an implicit assumption here. However, the user's example didn't list continuity unless it was given. Since the problem is about Brouwer's invariance of dimension, which is for continuous maps, so I should include continuity as an assumption.)\n\nBut the problem as stated in the question says \"If f: D^n → D^n with only one non-singleton inverse set f^{-1}(y) disjoint from the boundary, then y is in the interior...\" So the problem is written in a mathematical context where maps are continuous unless stated otherwise. So perhaps continuity is an assumption here.\n\nBut to be precise, since the original problem didn't explicitly state continuity, but in the context of invariance of dimension and Schoenflies theorem, continuity is necessary. So to make the assumptions explicit, we should include that f is continuous.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a continuous map from D^n to D^n.\n2. There exists a unique y ∈ D^n such that f^{-1}(y) contains more than one point.\n3. The preimage f^{-1}(y) is disjoint from the boundary of D^n (i.e., lies in the interior).\n4. All other preimages f^{-1}(z) for z ≠ y are either singletons or empty.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"only one non-singleton inverse set f^{-1}(y) disjoint from the boundary\". So this implies that for all other z ≠ y, f^{-1}(z) is a singleton or empty. So that's another assumption.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f: D^n → D^n is continuous.\n- There exists a y ∈ D^n such that f^{-1}(y) is a non-singleton set.\n- For all z ∈ D^n \\ {y}, f^{-1}(z) is a singleton or empty.\n- f^{-1}(y) is disjoint from the boundary of D^n.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that y is in the interior of the image of f.\n\nSo putting this all together in the required format.",
