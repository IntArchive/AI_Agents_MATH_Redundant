    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format the given problem according to the user's instructions. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object, line by line. Then, the problem statement is written clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The task is to prove that the integral I equals (ln3)/2 - (ln2)/3. The integral is from 0 to infinity of x divided by (x+1) times the square root of a quartic polynomial. The user has already included some steps, like rewriting the quartic polynomial as 4(x² + x +1)² - 3 and a substitution involving theta.\n\nNow, to extract assumptions. The integral is from 0 to infinity, so the function is integrated over that interval. The integrand involves a square root of a specific polynomial. The substitution made by the user is also part of the problem's setup. However, in the example given, assumptions were about the variables involved. Here, the problem is an integral, so perhaps the assumptions are about the variables and the substitutions used?\n\nWait, the example had assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But in this problem, the integral is definite, so maybe the main assumptions are the limits of integration, the integrand's form, and any substitutions or transformations applied? But the user's instructions say each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the original problem, the integral is from 0 to infinity. So that's one assumption: the integral is over [0, ∞). The integrand is x/((x+1)sqrt(4x⁴+8x³+12x²+8x+1)). Also, the problem uses a substitution where x is expressed in terms of theta, leading to a transformed integral from π/6 to π/2. So perhaps the substitution and the limits are part of the problem's setup but not assumptions. The problem statement itself is to prove the equality of the integral to that logarithmic expression.\n\nBut according to the example, the original problem's assumptions were listed as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7—it actually said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem? Wait, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption? That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that example is wrong? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe the example was part of a different problem where the user made a mistake? Or perhaps the original problem had additional constraints not stated here. But perhaps the user intended the example as a way to show how to list assumptions, even if they are not all explicitly stated.\n\nWait, perhaps in the original problem, the divisibility by 91 comes from factors 7 and 13, and the example's formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but maybe that was part of a step in solving it, not the original problem's statement. So maybe the user's example is incorrect. But regardless, according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question and filter out unrelated information, then structure it into assumptions and problem.\n\nSo in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is given. The user then presents steps involving substitution, leading to a transformed integral. But the problem to be answered is to prove that I equals (ln3)/2 - (ln2)/3. So the assumptions would be the conditions necessary for the problem. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variable n's properties. For this integral problem, perhaps the assumptions are the bounds of integration, the integrand's expression, and any given substitutions or transformations that are part of the problem's setup. But the problem is to prove the equality, so the given substitution steps are part of the solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the main assumptions here are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is x divided by (x + 1) times the square root of the quartic polynomial 4x⁴ +8x³ +12x² +8x +1.\n- The quartic polynomial is expressed as 4(x² + x +1)² -3.\n\nWait, but that's part of the note given by the user in the problem statement. So the problem says \"First note that 4x⁴ +8x³ +12x² +8x +1 =4(x² +x +1)² -3\", so that's a given identity. So that's an assumption or a given condition.\n\nAdditionally, the substitution x² +x +1 = sqrt(3)/(2 cos theta) is part of the problem's setup. So perhaps the substitution is part of the problem's given method, but in the problem statement, the user wants to structure the problem, not the solution steps. Therefore, the assumptions would include the expression of the quartic polynomial as 4(x² +x +1)² -3, and perhaps the substitution, but since substitutions are part of the solution method, maybe not. However, in the example, the substitution wasn't listed as an assumption, but the problem's own conditions were.\n\nWait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with n being an integer. The formatted problem included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but the original problem didn't have the second assumption. So perhaps the user in the example made an error, or perhaps the assumptions are derived from the problem's context. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to list all the conditions given in the problem, even if they are steps in the solution.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction: \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as the format\". So we need to read the problem, filter out any solution attempts or unrelated info, then structure the problem. The original problem on Math Stack Exchange is to calculate the integral I, which equals (ln3)/2 - (ln2)/3. The user provided their steps, but we need to present only the problem as per the format, with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nSo the actual problem, stripped of the solution attempt, is:\n\nCalculate the integral from 0 to infinity of [x / ((x + 1) sqrt(4x⁴ +8x³ +12x² +8x +1))] dx, and prove that it equals (ln3)/2 - (ln2)/3.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that 4x⁴ +8x³ +12x² +8x +1 =4(x² +x +1)^2 -3. That seems like a key identity provided in the problem statement. So this identity is part of the problem's given information, hence an assumption.\n\nSo assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is x / [(x + 1) sqrt(4x⁴ +8x³ +12x² +8x +1)].\n- The quartic polynomial is expressed as 4(x² + x +1)^2 -3.\n- The substitution x² + x +1 = sqrt(3)/(2 cosθ) is introduced (though this might be part of the solution attempt, but in the problem statement, the user includes it as a given step. However, in the example, substitutions weren't listed as assumptions. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the problem's assumptions were about the variable n, not the steps. Similarly, here, the problem's assumptions would be about the integral's parameters and given expressions. The substitution is part of the solution attempt, so maybe it's not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The integral is computed over the interval [0, ∞).\n2. The integrand is \\( \\frac{x}{(x + 1)\\sqrt{4x^4 + 8x^3 + 12x^2 + 8x + 1}} \\).\n3. The quartic polynomial under the square root can be factored as \\( 4(x^2 + x + 1)^2 - 3 \\).\n\nThe problem is to prove that this integral equals \\( \\frac{\\ln 3}{2} - \\frac{\\ln 2}{3} \\).\n\nBut wait, the original problem includes the substitution step and the transformed integral. However, in the example, the formatted problem only included the problem statement and assumptions, not the solution steps. Therefore, in structuring the problem, we should only include the given conditions and the problem to be solved. The substitution is part of the user's attempt, so we should exclude it. So the problem is to calculate the integral with the given integrand, knowing that the quartic polynomial can be expressed as 4(x² +x +1)^2 -3.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would list those three assumptions and the problem statement to prove the integral equals the given logarithmic expression.",
