    "Content": "This is an exercise in real analysis: Let $E\\subset{\\Bbb R}^d$ be Lebesgue measurable. Show that \n  $$\nm(E)=\\sup\\{m(K):K\\subset E, K \\text{compact}\\}.\n$$ When $E$ is bounded, this can be done by the following proposition: $E\\subset{\\Bbb R}^d$ is Lebesgue measurable if and only if for every $\\varepsilon>0$, one can find a closed set $F$ contained in $E$ with $m^*(E\\setminus F)\\leq\\varepsilon$. How can I deal with the case that $E$ is unbounded?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You've done the case when $E$ is bounded. When $E$ is unbounded, there are two cases: $m(E)=+\\infty$ $m(E)<+\\infty$ Now we handle with the first case. Consider the closed ball in ${\\Bbb R}^d$ $A_m=\\{x\\in{\\Bbb R}^d: |x|\\leq m\\}$. Then $$\nE=\\cup_{m=1}^{\\infty}E_m\n$$\nwith $E_m=E\\cap A_m$, and $E_1\\subset E_2\\subset\\cdots\\subset{\\Bbb R}^d$. By monotone convergence theorem for measurable sets, \n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}m(E_n)=m(E)=+\\infty.\n$$\nNote that since $E_m$ is bounded, by the case you've done, for every $m$, we have a compact set $K_m\\subset E_m\\subset E$ such that $m(K_m)+1\\geq m(E_m)\\to\\infty$. Hence \n$$\\sup\\{m(K):K\\subset E,K\\text{compact}\\}=+\\infty=m(E).$$ Now assume that $m(E)<+\\infty$. For any $\\varepsilon>0$, we can choose $N$ such that\n$$\nm(E)\\leq m(E_N)+\\varepsilon/2.\n$$\nWe also have a compact set $K\\subset E_N\\subset E$ with \n$$\nm(E_N)\\leq m(K)+\\varepsilon/2\n$$\nsince $E_N$ is bounded. It follows that\n$$\nm(E)\\leq m(K)+\\varepsilon.\n$$\nWe are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the required format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about proving inner regularity of Lebesgue measurable sets. The problem states that for a Lebesgue measurable set E in R^d, the measure of E is the supremum of the measures of compact subsets K contained in E. They mention that when E is bounded, they can use a proposition that allows approximating E from inside with closed sets, but they're stuck on the unbounded case.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem gives E as a subset of R^d that's Lebesgue measurable. The goal is to show the supremum of m(K) over compact K subsets of E equals m(E). The user also references a proposition for the bounded case, which involves closed sets, but the key here is dealing with unbounded E.\n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each addressing a single property or condition on one object. Let me parse that:\n\n1. E is a subset of R^d.\n2. E is Lebesgue measurable.\n3. The problem requires considering both bounded and unbounded cases of E, but the specific challenge is when E is unbounded.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user doesn't explicitly state that E could be unbounded as an assumption. The original problem just says \"Let E be Lebesgue measurable\" and the user's difficulty is when E is unbounded. So the assumptions from the problem are:\n\n- E is a Lebesgue measurable subset of R^d.\n\nThe problem is to show m(E) is the sup of m(K) over compact K inside E. The user knows how to do it when E is bounded using closed approximations but needs help with unbounded E.\n\nSo the structured problem should have the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a subset of R^d,\nE is Lebesgue measurable.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$m(E)=\\sup\\{m(K):K\\subset E, K \\text{ compact}\\}.$$\n\nThe example given in the user's instruction had assumptions listed line by line, each with one property. So here, the two assumptions are E being a subset of R^d and E being Lebesgue measurable.\n\nThe user's specific issue is handling the unbounded case, but that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the problem as stated in the format is to show the equality, with the key challenge being the unbounded case. However, the original problem doesn't restrict to unbounded E; it's the entire statement. The user's approach splits into bounded (which they can handle) and unbounded (needs help). But the problem as presented in the format should capture the original problem, not the user's specific difficulty. Wait, the user is showing how they approached the bounded case and asks about the unbounded. But the problem itself is general. However, the example given by the user in their instruction included an assumption from the original problem (n divisible by 7) even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nWait, the original example says: Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Wait, maybe the user is showing that they added an assumption, but actually, the original problem didn't have it. That might be confusing. Wait, perhaps the example was an illustration where they filtered out unrelated information and structured the problem with necessary assumptions. But in the original problem, the user might have included extra context that's not part of the core problem. Wait, perhaps the example was a way to extract the key assumptions from a problem that had more context. So, in the current problem, the user's question is about inner regularity, and the original problem states that E is Lebesgue measurable. So the assumptions are E is a subset of R^d and E is Lebesgue measurable. The problem is to show the measure is the sup over compact subsets. The user's specific issue is about the unbounded case, but the problem as stated is general. So the formatted problem should just state the original problem's assumptions and problem, without including the user's specific difficulty. The example given by the user included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), but that might have been a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps in their example, they misrepresented the problem. Wait, perhaps the original example had a problem where n is an integer, and the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that would change the problem. Hmm. Maybe the example was incorrect. Regardless, the current task is to follow the example's structure, even if the example had issues. In the current problem, the user's problem is to prove the inner regularity for any Lebesgue measurable E, with the user having trouble with the unbounded case. But the problem itself is the general case. So the formatted problem should include the two assumptions: E is a subset of R^d, E is Lebesgue measurable. The problem is to show m(E) is the sup of m(K) over compact K in E. The user's mention of the bounded case and their specific question about unbounded E is part of their approach, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the general assumptions and the general problem.",
