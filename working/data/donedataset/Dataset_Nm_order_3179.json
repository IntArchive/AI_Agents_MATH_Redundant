    "Content": "The graph of $f$ is $G(f) = \\{(x,f(x)) : x\\in X\\} \\subseteq X\\times Y$ $X$ and $Y$ are metric spaces. a) Suppose $f$ is continuous and prove that $G(f)$ is a closed set. b) Suppose that $G(f)$ is compact and prove that $f$ is continous For a), the definition of a closed set that comes to my mind is a set that contains all its limit points (or was it accumulation points?), is there another equivalent definition that may b more helpful to prove a)? Is it possible to prove this directly? Because at first glance the only way I could imagine to prove this is by contradiction or contrapositive. I imagine that the proof of b) will be immediately derived from a).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "a) Let $(z_n)=(x_n,f(x_n))$ be a convergent sequence of $G(f)$. If $(x,y)$ is its limit, show that $y=f(x)$. b) Let $x\\in X$ and $(x_n)$ a convergent sequence with limit $x$. You have to prove that $(f(x_n))$ is convergent in $Y$ with limit $f(x)$. Use the sequence $z_n=(x_n,f(x_n))$ and use the fact that $G(f)$ is compact to prove that $(f(x_n))$ has $f(x)$ as an accumulation point. \nThen prove that any subsequence of $(f(x_n))$ has $f(x)$ as an accumulation point.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the specified format, which includes listing assumptions and then stating the problem. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe original problem is divided into two parts, a) and b). However, the user's example only includes part a) of the problem. Wait, but looking back at the user's example, they included the original problem which had a part a) and b), but in the formatted version, they only addressed part a). Hmm, maybe the user wants me to handle each part separately? Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had a part about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included only the relevant assumptions and the problem statement. The user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format. The original question here has parts a) and b). Should I split them into two separate problems or include both in one? The example provided by the user only took part of the original problem (the divisibility by 91), so maybe here I should treat part a) and part b) as separate problems. But the user hasn't specified whether to handle both parts. Wait, looking at the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and the formatted problem kept the entire problem but listed the assumptions. In this case, the original question has two parts, a) and b), but the user's example didn't split parts. Wait, in the example, the original problem was a single statement, but here the original problem has two parts. The user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example included all the assumptions, even if the original problem had multiple parts. Wait, in the example, the original problem was a single problem, but the formatted version included an additional assumption (n is divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original. Wait, no—wait the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's odd. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake here. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean the assumption is just that n is an integer, but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the example is from a different problem. Wait, perhaps the user intended to present a problem where n is divisible by 7 as part of the problem's conditions, but in their example, they might have copied the wrong original problem. This is confusing. Maybe I should proceed based on the instructions given, despite the example possibly being incorrect.\n\nBut moving forward. The current problem is about proving that if a function f: X→Y is continuous, then its graph is closed (part a), and if the graph is compact, then f is continuous (part b). The user wants me to structure the problem according to the format, listing assumptions and then the problem. The example seems to list assumptions that are given in the problem, but in their example, they added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original. Wait, that suggests that maybe the example is not correctly aligned. Alternatively, perhaps the example was from a different problem. Hmm. This is a bit confusing, but perhaps I should proceed by extracting the assumptions from the problem as stated, without adding new ones. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean that the only assumption is that n is an integer. Adding that n is divisible by 7 would restrict the problem. So maybe there's an error in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions, which say: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The format includes Assumption: line by line, each assumption addressing only one property or condition applied to one object, then Problem: the problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, part a) is: Prove that if a function f: X→Y is continuous, then its graph is closed. The problem mentions that X and Y are metric spaces. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- X is a metric space.\n- Y is a metric space.\n- f: X→Y is continuous.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to one object. Then the problem is to prove that G(f) is closed in X×Y.\n\nSimilarly, part b) is: Suppose that G(f) is compact and prove that f is continuous. Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a metric space.\n- Y is a metric space.\n- G(f) is compact.\n\nBut the user's example only handled one part of the original problem. Since the original problem here has two parts, a) and b), I need to check whether the user wants both parts formatted or just one. The original question includes both parts, but the user's example only formatted one part. The instructions say to \"structure that problem\", which might mean both parts as separate problems. However, the example provided by the user formatted a problem with multiple assumptions but only one problem statement. Wait, the example's original problem was a single problem statement, but the formatted version included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. This suggests that perhaps the user wants us to extract assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. But in the given example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect, but regardless, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nLooking at the current problem: the user on Math Stack Exchange is asking about part a) and part b). The question title is \"Prove that if a function f: X→Y continuous then its graph is closed\", which is part a). Then part b) is about compact graph implying continuity. The user in their question also mentions some thoughts about definitions for closed sets and methods of proof. But to format the problem as per the user's instructions, we need to extract the assumptions and problem statement.\n\nFor part a):\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. X is a metric space.\n2. Y is a metric space.\n3. f: X → Y is continuous.\n\nProblem: Prove that the graph G(f) = {(x, f(x)) : x ∈ X} is closed in X × Y.\n\nFor part b):\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. X is a metric space.\n2. Y is a metric space.\n3. G(f) is compact.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous.\n\nHowever, the user's example includes only part of the original problem. Since the user's example included assumptions that were perhaps not explicit in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), maybe here they want us to list all necessary assumptions, even if they are part of the definition. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which implies that the assumption is n is an integer. But the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Alternatively, perhaps the example was from a different problem where the original had additional conditions. Anyway, for the current problem, the assumptions are as I listed above.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, part a) says \"Suppose f is continuous and prove that G(f) is a closed set.\" The problem mentions that X and Y are metric spaces. So those are the assumptions. Each should be listed line by line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem for part a) would be:\n\nAssumption: \nX is a metric space,\nY is a metric space,\nf: X → Y is continuous.\n\nProblem: Prove that G(f) = {(x, f(x)) : x ∈ X} is closed in X × Y.\n\nSimilarly for part b), but the user's example only included part a) in their example. However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem as per the format. The user hasn't specified whether to handle both parts or just one. Since the example included a single problem, maybe we should treat each part as a separate problem. However, the original question in the example had a single problem. Given that, perhaps the current problem has two parts, but the user wants each part to be formatted separately. But the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", and the example included a single problem. So perhaps we should present both parts as separate problems. Alternatively, the user might want both parts in one. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was a single problem (Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n). The formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem. But in reality, the original problem's assumption should just be \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original. This suggests that perhaps the example is flawed. Maybe there was a miscommunication. Anyway, proceeding with the current problem.\n\nThe problem has two parts. The user's example didn't split parts, but the original problem here does. The user's instruction says to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem. The original question includes the user's thoughts about definitions and proof methods, which are unrelated to the problem statement. So we need to extract only the problem statement and its assumptions.\n\nFor part a):\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- X is a metric space.\n- Y is a metric space.\n- f is continuous.\n\nProblem: Prove that G(f) is closed in X × Y.\n\nFor part b):\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- X is a metric space.\n- Y is a metric space.\n- G(f) is compact.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous.\n\nBut the user's example combined multiple assumptions into separate lines. So each assumption is on its own line. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Similarly, here, each property (X is metric, Y is metric, f continuous) are separate.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem for part a) is:\n\nAssumption: \nX is a metric space,\nY is a metric space,\nf: X → Y is continuous.\nProblem:\nProve that the graph G(f) = {(x, f(x)) : x ∈ X} is closed in X × Y.\n\nFor part b):\n\nAssumption: \nX is a metric space,\nY is a metric space,\nG(f) is compact.\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous.\n\nHowever, the original question's title only mentions part a), but the body includes both parts. The user might want both parts formatted. But the example provided by the user only addressed one part. Since the instructions say to \"structure that problem\" (singular), perhaps the user wants each part as a separate problem. Alternatively, maybe they want both parts together. But the example separated them into one. Alternatively, maybe the user wants only part a) formatted, as per the title. But the question body includes both parts. To be safe, perhaps structure each part separately.\n\nBut the user's instructions say \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". The original question has two parts, so each part is a separate problem. Therefore, the answer should have two formatted problems: one for part a) and one for part b).\n\nBut the user's example didn't do that. The example took a single problem and formatted it. So maybe the user wants both parts included in the same format. But the format requires \"Problem: <the problem>\". So if there are two separate problems (a and b), each with their own assumptions, perhaps they should be formatted separately.\n\nHowever, the user's example didn't split parts, but the original example's problem was a single statement. Here, the original problem has two parts. To adhere to the user's format, perhaps each part should be formatted individually. Therefore, the final answer would include two formatted problems: one for part a) and one for part b).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to combine them, but the example didn't. Since the user's example included a single problem, maybe I should format each part separately.\n\nIn conclusion, I will format part a) and part b) as separate problems following the given format.",
