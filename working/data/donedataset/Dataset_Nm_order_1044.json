    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example given shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange: the title is about a geometric proof of ζ(2)=π²/6 and mentions other integer inputs for the Zeta function. The question asks if there's a known geometric proof for ζ(2)=π²/6 and also considers geometric proofs for identities of ζ at positive even integers and negative integers.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The main problem here is the request for geometric proofs of specific zeta function identities. The original problem mentions three parts: ζ(2)=π²/6, ζ(2n) for positive even integers, and ζ(-n) for negative integers. \n\nNow, structuring this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem holds. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is more about the existence or nature of proofs rather than conditions on variables. But since the problem is asking for geometric proofs, maybe the assumptions relate to the known identities or properties of the zeta function. Wait, but the example's assumptions were about the variables in the problem. So perhaps here, the assumptions should be the properties of the zeta function that are given, but the problem is to prove these using geometric methods.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the original question is asking if there are known geometric proofs for ζ(2)=π²/6 and the other identities. So the problem isn't to prove these equalities under certain conditions, but rather to inquire about the existence or method of a geometric proof. However, the example given was a problem to prove a divisibility under certain assumptions. So maybe the user wants to structure the problem as a request to prove these identities using geometric methods, with the assumptions being the definitions or known properties of the zeta function.\n\nBut the original problem is phrased as a question: \"Is there a known geometric proof...\" which is a different type of question. However, the example transformed the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. So maybe we need to rephrase the question as a problem statement to prove, even though the original is asking about the existence of a proof. Alternatively, maybe the problem part remains as the question, but the assumptions are the given identities. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nLooking back at the example: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the example's formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7. Maybe the example was modified? Wait, the user provided an example where the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps it's intentional for the example. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7 as an assumption, which would restrict the problem. Maybe that's an error, but perhaps that's part of the task—to extract the assumptions from the problem. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7; it said \"for every integer n\", so the example's formatted problem is incorrect. Hmm, maybe the user intended to show that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem might have assumptions that are not in the original? That seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the example is correct because maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) - 6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But 91 is 7*13. So if the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, then perhaps the assumptions in the formatted problem are incorrect. However, maybe the example is a different problem where the user added an assumption. This is confusing. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction, which is to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem parts, with each assumption being one line, one property per object.\n\nBack to the current problem. The original question is asking if there's a known geometric proof for ζ(2)=π²/6 and others. To structure this as a problem to prove, perhaps we need to phrase it as \"Prove that ζ(2)=π²/6 using a geometric method\" and similarly for the other identities. The assumptions would be the definitions or given properties. However, the original problem doesn't state any assumptions; it's asking if such proofs exist. So perhaps the assumptions are implicit. For example, ζ(s) is defined as the sum over n^-s for Re(s)>1, analytic continuation for other s, etc. But maybe the problem is to prove these identities under the assumption that ζ(s) is defined in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about geometric proofs, perhaps the assumptions relate to geometric configurations or methods. For example, for ζ(2)=π²/6, a classic result often proven using calculus or Fourier series, but the question is about a geometric proof. So maybe the assumptions would be that certain geometric constructions or figures are used.\n\nBut the user's example took the original problem, which didn't have assumptions, and added an assumption (n divisible by 7). This seems like an error, but perhaps in the example, the user intended to create a problem with specific assumptions. Maybe the original example was incorrect, but the user wants the task to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is correct in that the original problem had an error, and the formatted problem corrected it. But I'm not sure. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, since the user is asking for geometric proofs, the assumptions would include that geometric methods are to be used, but how to phrase that?\n\nWait, the example's assumptions were about the variable n: being an integer and divisible by 7. So in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are about the domain of the zeta function, like s being a positive even integer or negative integer. Let's look at the problem again.\n\nThe problem in the original question is:\n\n1. ζ(2) = π²/6 (sum from n=1 to ∞ of 1/n²)\n2. For positive even integers: ζ(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} B_{2n} (2π)^{2n} / [2(2n)!]\n3. For negative integers: ζ(-n) = -B_{n+1}/(n+1)\n\nSo the problem is to prove these identities using geometric proofs. The assumptions would be:\n\n- For the first part: ζ(2) is defined as the sum of 1/n² from n=1 to ∞.\n- For the second part: ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function extended to even positive integers.\n- For the third part: ζ(s) is analytically continued to negative integers.\n\nBut these are more like definitions or properties rather than assumptions. Alternatively, the assumptions could be that s is a positive even integer or a negative integer. But the problem is to prove the identities using geometric methods. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nFor each identity:\n\n1. For ζ(2)=π²/6: Assumption is that ζ(2) is defined as the sum over n=1 to ∞ of 1/n².\n2. For ζ(2n)=...: Assumption is that n is a positive integer, and ζ is evaluated at even positive integers.\n3. For ζ(-n)=...: Assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, and ζ is analytically continued to negative integers.\n\nBut the original problem is asking for geometric proofs of these identities, so maybe the assumptions are that the proofs must use geometric methods, but that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to find a geometric proof, the assumptions would be the standard definitions and properties of the zeta function, and the problem is to prove these equalities using geometric arguments.\n\nBut following the example, which took the original problem (prove for every integer n) and added an assumption (n is divisible by 7), which might be incorrect, but perhaps in this case, we need to list the necessary conditions for the identities to hold. For example, ζ(2n) formula holds for positive even integers, so assumption: n is a positive even integer. Wait, but the problem statement for ζ(2n) is for positive even inputs, so the assumption is that n is a positive integer, and 2n is even. Similarly, for ζ(-n), n is a positive integer.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumptions:\n- For ζ(2): s=2, and ζ(s) is defined as the sum from n=1 to ∞ of n^{-s}.\n- For ζ(2n): n is a positive integer, and ζ(s) is evaluated at s=2n.\n- For ζ(-n): n is a non-negative integer, and ζ(s) is analytically continued to s=-n.\n\nBut the problem is to prove these identities using geometric methods. So the assumptions are the conditions under which the identities hold, and the problem is to provide a geometric proof.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are that certain geometric configurations or methods are applicable.\n\nBut given the example, which listed assumptions about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), perhaps here the assumptions would be:\n\n- s=2 is a positive even integer.\n- For ζ(2n), n is a positive integer.\n- For ζ(-n), n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The example seems to have introduced an assumption not present in the original problem (divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake. But perhaps the user wants to extract the implicit assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the original problem here, the identities are given for specific inputs: positive even integers and negative integers. So the assumptions would be that s is a positive even integer or a negative integer, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\ns=2 is a positive even integer,\ns=2n where n is a positive integer,\ns=-n where n is a non-negative integer,\nζ(s) is defined as the sum from n=1 to ∞ n^{-s} for Re(s)>1,\nζ(s) is analytically continued for other values of s.\n\nProblem:\nProve using geometric methods that:\n1. ζ(2) = π²/6,\n2. ζ(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} B_{2n} (2π)^{2n} / [2(2n)!],\n3. ζ(-n) = -B_{n+1}/(n+1).\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps each assumption is a single condition:\n\nAssumption:\ns=2 is a positive even integer,\nFor ζ(2n), n is a positive integer,\nFor ζ(-n), n is a non-negative integer,\nζ(s) is defined as the sum from n=1 to ∞ n^{-s} for Re(s) > 1,\nζ(s) is analytically continued to the complex plane except s=1.\n\nProblem:\nProve using geometric proofs that:\n1. ζ(2) = π²/6,\n2. ζ(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} (B_{2n} (2π)^{2n}) / [2(2n)!],\n3. ζ(-n) = -B_{n+1}/(n+1).\n\nBut I'm not sure if the analytic continuation is considered an assumption here. The original problem is asking about proving these identities with geometric methods, so maybe the assumptions are just the values of s (s=2, s=2n, s=-n) and the definitions of ζ(s).\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about the existence of geometric proofs, the assumptions might not be mathematical conditions but rather methodological (use of geometry). However, according to the example, the assumptions are about the problem's variables or conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem part is just restating the original question, and the assumptions are the given identities. But the example transformed the original problem into a prove statement with added assumptions. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the user's example, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nOriginal problem asks to prove three identities using geometric methods. So the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- For ζ(2): s=2,\n- For ζ(2n): n is a positive integer, s=2n,\n- For ζ(-n): n is a non-negative integer, s=-n,\n- ζ(s) is defined as the sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s for Re(s) > 1,\n- ζ(s) is analytically continued for other s.\n\nProblem:\nProve using geometric methods that:\n1. ζ(2) = π²/6,\n2. ζ(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} (B_{2n}(2π)^{2n})/(2(2n)!),\n3. ζ(-n) = -B_{n+1}/(n+1).\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\ns=2 is a positive even integer,\ns=2n where n is a positive integer,\ns=-n where n is a non-negative integer,\nζ(s) is defined as the sum from n=1 to ∞ n^{-s} for Re(s) > 1,\nζ(s) has an analytic continuation to the complex plane except s=1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. ζ(2) = π²/6,\n2. ζ(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} \\frac{B_{2n}(2\\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!},\n3. ζ(-n) = -\\frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1},\nusing geometric proofs.\n\nBut the problem part should be a single problem statement. The original question is asking about three separate identities, so perhaps the problem is to prove all three using geometric methods. However, the example's problem part was a single statement. So perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nProve using geometric methods that:\n1. ζ(2)=\\frac{1}{6}\\pi^2,\n2. For positive even integers, ζ(2n)=(-1)^{n+1} \\frac{B_{2n}(2\\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!},\n3. For negative integers, ζ(-n)=-\\frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1}.\n\nBut the example had the problem part as a single line. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove the general cases, but the user example listed the specific case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem part is:\n\n\"Prove that ζ(2)=π²/6 using a geometric proof. Moreover, provide geometric proofs for the identities ζ(2n)=... and ζ(-n)=... for positive even integers and negative integers respectively.\"\n\nBut the example used a single problem statement, so maybe we need to combine all three into one problem statement.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering the example and the requirements, I'll structure the assumptions as the conditions on s and the definition of ζ(s), and the problem as proving the three identities using geometric methods.",
