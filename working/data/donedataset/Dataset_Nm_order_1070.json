    "Content": "$R$ is a domain with characteristic $p$ ($p$ is prime). There is a homomorphism $f : R \\to R$, $f(a)=a^p$. $f$ is called the Frobenius endomorphism . And I have known this. When $R$ which is mentioned above is also a field, it is said that $f$ is an isomorphism. I think I just need to ensure $f$ is bijective. But I don't know how to prove it's surjective. Actually I have got your ideas. In some of your opinions, if it is finite, then it can be surjective. Then what if it is infinite? In my question, $R$ is a field as well as a domain. Then I wonder whether the \"domain\" is helpful for the proof of surjection or not.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "All fields are domains ; being a domain is not some extra property that a field may or may not have. The Frobenius homomorphism is often called the Frobenius endomorphism , since \" endomorphism \" is a more specific term meaning \"map from something to itself\". However, I'll use \"homomorphism\" here to avoid confusion. Let $K=\\mathbb{F}_p(T)$, the rational functions in the variable $T$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_p=\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$. That is, \n$$K=\\mathbb{F}_p(T)=\\left\\{\\,\\frac{f}{g}\\,\\Bigg|\\,\\,\\,f,g\\in\\mathbb{F}_p[T], g\\neq0\\right\\}.$$\nThen the Frobenius homomorphism $\\phi:K\\to K$ is not surjective, because (for instance) the element $T$ is not in the image of $\\phi$. This is because if we had $\\phi(\\frac{f}{g})=\\frac{f^{\\;p}}{g^{\\;p}}=T$ for some $\\frac{f}{g}\\in K$, then we have $p(\\deg(f)-\\deg(g))=\\deg(T)=1$, which is impossible as $\\deg(f)-\\deg(g)$ is an integer and $1$ is not divisible by $p$. Now let $K=\\mathbb{F}_p$. Then the Frobenius homomorphism $\\phi:K\\to K$ is surjective, because it is in fact equal to the identity map, i.e. $\\phi(x)=x$ for all $x\\in K$. More generally, if $K$ is any finite field of characteristic $p$, then the Frobenius homomorphism is surjective, because (as I will show below) it is always injective, and an injective function from a finite set to itself must be surjective . However, it is not necessary that $K$ be finite in order for the Frobenius homomorphism to be surjective. For example, now let $K=\\mathbb{F}_p(T^{\\;1/p^\\infty})$. That is,\n$$K=\\mathbb{F}_p(T^{\\;1/p^\\infty})=\\mathbb{F}_p(T,\\sqrt[p]{T\\;},\\sqrt[p^2]{T\\;},\\ldots).$$ This is certainly an infinite field. The Frobenius homomorphism $\\phi:K\\to K$ is surjective. For example, the element $\\alpha\\in K$,\n$$\\alpha=\\frac{\\sqrt[p]{T\\;}+2\\cdot(\\sqrt[p^2]{T\\;})^3}{T^{\\;2}-5T^{\\;p}}$$\nis in the image of $\\phi$, because we can replace every occurrence of a $T^{\\;p^d}$ with a one-lower-power-of-$p$ exponent, i.e.\n$$\\phi(\\beta)=\\alpha,\\text{ where }\\quad\\beta=\\frac{\\sqrt[p^2]{T\\;}+2\\cdot(\\sqrt[p^3]{T\\;})^3}{(\\sqrt[p]{T\\;})^{\\;2}-5T}$$\nSimilarly with any other element of $K$. (Note that $2$ or $5$ could very well be equal to $p$, and hence equal to $0$.) Incidentally, the field $\\mathbb{F}_p(T^{\\;1/p^\\infty})$ is called the perfection of the field $\\mathbb{F}_p(T)$. It is a theorem that a field $K$ of characteristic $p$ is perfect if and only if the Frobenius homomorphism $\\phi:K \\to K$ is surjective, and by adding in $p^n$-th roots of every element of $\\mathbb{F}_p(T)$, we have made a field for which it must be surjective, hence the name. Now, some books (for example, McCarthy's Algebraic Extensions of Fields ) use the term \"isomorphism\" to mean what we now call \"monomorphism\" (injective homomorphism), and when they want to express what we now call \"isomorphism\" (bijective homomorphism), they would say \" onto isomorphism\" (since onto is a synonym for surjective, and bijective = injective + surjective). If for some reason you are using this older terminology, then the Frobenius homomorphism for a field is always an \"isomorphism\" (i.e. injective). This is because, if $K$ is any field of characteristic $p$, and $\\phi:K\\to K$ is the Frobenius homomorphism, then\n$$\\begin{align*}\\phi(\\alpha)=\\alpha^p=\\beta^p=\\phi(\\beta)&\\implies\\alpha^p-\\beta^p=0\\\\ &\\implies(\\alpha-\\beta)^p=0\\\\ & \\implies\\alpha-\\beta=0\\\\ & \\implies\\alpha=\\beta.\\end{align*}$$\nIn fact, any homomorphism from a field $K$ to a non-zero ring $R$ must be injective (what could its kernel be, as an ideal of the field $K$?) Also note that, by the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings , we therefore have that any homomorphism $f:K\\to R$ from a field $K$ to a non-zero ring $R$ is an isomorphism (in the modern sense) onto the subring of $R$ that is the image of $f$, i.e. if we threw out the rest of $R$ and only looked at the subring $f(K)$, then $f:K\\to f(K)$ is an isomorphism (in the modern sense). This is what Jyrki Lahtonen conjectured that you meant above. If we look at things that are not domains (and so in particular are not fields), then the Frobenius homomorphism need not be injective. For example, let $R=\\mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^p)$. That is,\n$$R=\\mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^p)=\\{a_0+\\cdots+a_{p-1}x^{p-1}+(x^p)\\mid a_i\\in\\mathbb{F}_p\\}.$$\nThen if $\\phi:R\\to R$ is the Frobenius homomorphism, we have for example $x+(x^p)\\neq0+(x^p)$, but $$\\phi(x+(x^p))=x^p+(x^p)=0+(x^p)=0^p+(x^p)=\\phi(0+(x^p)).$$ On a final note, I just want to emphasize that the concept of a Frobenius homomorphism is only applicable if the field is of characteristic $p$ (as all the examples above were). For example, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a field of characteristic $0$, and for any prime $p$, the function $f:\\mathbb{Q}\\to\\mathbb{Q}$ defined by $f(a)=a^p$ is not a homomorphism (compare $f(2)$ with $2\\cdot f(1)$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe question is about proving that the Frobenius endomorphism is surjective. The key details provided are: R is a domain with characteristic p (a prime), and the Frobenius endomorphism f is defined by f(a) = a^p. The user mentions that when R is a field, f is an isomorphism. They are confused about proving surjectivity, especially in the case where R is infinite. They also question whether the domain property helps in proving surjection.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that R is a domain with characteristic p, which is prime. Then, the Frobenius endomorphism f is given by f(a) = a^p. The problem asks to prove that f is surjective when R is a field. Wait, actually, the user says \"When R which is mentioned above is also a field...\" So the key here is that R is both a field and a domain of characteristic p. But since all fields are domains, the main assumptions are that R is a field and has characteristic p. The problem is to prove that the Frobenius endomorphism is surjective (hence bijective since it's already a homomorphism and injective in a field).\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions list each property applied to one object. So in this case:\n\nAssumption 1: R is a field. (Since the problem states R is a domain but then specifies when it's a field, so the problem's context is when R is a field, which is a domain with additional properties.)\n\nAssumption 2: R has characteristic p (a prime). (Given in the problem statement.)\n\nAssumption 3: f: R → R is defined by f(a) = a^p. (The definition of the Frobenius endomorphism.)\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is surjective. The user is confused about the infinite case and whether being a domain helps. But in the context of the problem, since R is a field, the domain part is inherent, but the key is that it's a field. For finite fields, Frobenius is surjective because injective implies surjective. For infinite fields, like a field of characteristic p, the Frobenius map is actually not necessarily surjective unless the field is perfect. Wait, but in the case of finite fields, it's surjective. For infinite fields, for example, the Frobenius endomorphism on F_p(t), the field of rational functions, is not surjective because t is not a p-th power. So there's a mistake here. But the user is under the impression that when R is a field, f is an isomorphism. However, that's only true for perfect fields. But maybe the user is working under the assumption that the field is finite. Wait, the original question says \"when R is also a field, it is said that f is an isomorphism.\" So perhaps the problem is to prove that in a field of characteristic p, the Frobenius endomorphism is surjective, but this is only true for perfect fields. However, finite fields are perfect, so in that case, the Frobenius automorphism is indeed surjective. But in general, for infinite fields, it might not be. So there's a confusion here. But the user's problem is structured as needing to prove surjectivity when R is a field (assuming characteristic p). However, the actual problem might have an implicit assumption that R is finite, but the user is questioning the infinite case. However, the original problem as presented by the user says \"When R which is mentioned above is also a field, it is said that f is an isomorphism.\" So the task is to prove that f is surjective when R is a field of characteristic p. The user's confusion is about infinite fields. But according to standard algebra, Frobenius is surjective if and only if the field is perfect. For finite fields, Frobenius is indeed an automorphism, but for infinite fields, it's not necessarily. However, the problem as posed by the user might be missing some conditions. But based on the user's question, they are to structure the problem as presented, not to correct it. So the assumptions are: R is a field, R has characteristic p (prime), f(a) = a^p. The problem is to prove that f is surjective. The user's confusion is about infinite fields, but the original problem might have an implicit assumption of R being finite? Wait, the original problem says \"When R is also a field, it is said that f is an isomorphism.\" So maybe the problem is to prove that for a field of characteristic p, the Frobenius endomorphism is surjective. But in reality, that's only true for perfect fields. However, in the context of the problem, perhaps the user is working under the standard textbook scenario where fields are either finite or algebraically closed, hence perfect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that in a finite field, Frobenius is surjective. But the original problem doesn't specify finite. However, the user mentions that in some opinions, if it's finite, then it's surjective, and they're asking about the infinite case. So the actual problem is likely as follows: Given R is a field of characteristic p (prime), prove that the Frobenius endomorphism f(a) = a^p is surjective. But the user is confused because in the infinite case, this isn't true. However, perhaps the original problem is missing the finite condition. But since the user hasn't specified, we have to go with what's given. The original problem states: \"When R which is mentioned above is also a field, it is said that f is an isomorphism. I think I just need to ensure f is bijective. But I don't know how to prove it's surjective.\" So the problem is: Prove that if R is a field of characteristic p, then the Frobenius endomorphism f(a)=a^p is surjective. But as we know, this isn't generally true for infinite fields. However, in the context of the problem, perhaps the user is working under a misapprehension. But since our task is to structure the problem as given, not to correct it, the assumptions would be R is a field, R has characteristic p (prime), f(a) = a^p, and the problem is to prove f is surjective. The user's confusion is about the infinite case, but that's part of their question, not the problem statement. Therefore, the structured problem should include the assumptions as R being a field, characteristic p, and f defined as such, and the problem is to prove surjectivity.",
