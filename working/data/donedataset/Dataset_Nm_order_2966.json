It is easy to show that a convex combination of orthogonal matrices has norm (I mean the norm as operators) not larger than $1$. The reverse seems quite tricky...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Presumably the norm in question is the operator $2$-norm, i.e. the largest singular value. Now suppose $\\|A\\|\\le1$. Consider the singular value decomposition $A=U\\Sigma V^T$, where $U,V$ are real orthogonal and $\\Sigma=\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{s})$ for some $\\mathbf{s}\\in[0,1]^n$ is a diagonal matrix with entries between $0$ and $1$. Since products of orthogonal matrices are orthogonal, it suffices to show that $\\Sigma$ is a convex combination of orthogonal matrices, but clearly, $\\mathbf{s}$ is a convex combination of the extreme points $\\mathbf{s}_1,\\mathbf{s}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{s}_{2^n}$ of $\\{-1,1\\}^n$. Therefore $\\Sigma$ is a convex combination of $\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{s}_1),\\,\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{s}_2),\\,\\ldots,\\,\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{s}_{2^n})$, which are real orthogonal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. Let me start by carefully reading the original question.\n\nThe title is \"Convex hull of orthogonal matrices\". The question asks where to find the proof that the convex hull of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with norm not greater than one. The user mentions that showing a convex combination of orthogonal matrices has norm ≤1 is easy, but the reverse is tricky.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The problem is about orthogonal matrices. So one assumption is that we're dealing with orthogonal matrices. In math terms, orthogonal matrices are matrices Q such that Q^T Q = I, where Q^T is the transpose and I is the identity matrix. But the problem statement doesn't specify the space, like real or complex matrices. Since orthogonal matrices are typically real, maybe that's an implicit assumption here.\n\n2. The convex hull of the set of orthogonal matrices. So the convex hull is the set of all convex combinations of orthogonal matrices.\n\n3. The target set is matrices with operator norm not greater than one. Operator norm here refers to the spectral norm, which for matrices is the largest singular value, or equivalently, the maximum norm of Ax over x with ||x||=1. So another assumption is that we're considering matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that the convex hull of orthogonal matrices equals the set of matrices with norm ≤1. So the assumptions would be the properties each part must satisfy. But the problem is to show the equality between two sets: the convex hull on one side, and the norm-bounded matrices on the other. \n\nSo the assumptions would need to cover:\n\n- The set of orthogonal matrices (each element is orthogonal).\n- The convex hull is taken over these orthogonal matrices.\n- The set of matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nBut how to split these into individual assumptions? The user's example had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, we might have:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are orthogonal,\nThe convex hull is considered,\nThe operator norm (spectral norm) is used,\nThe set of matrices in consideration have norm ≤1.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that the convex hull of orthogonal matrices is exactly the set of matrices with norm ≤1. So maybe the key assumptions are that we are working with real matrices (since orthogonal matrices are real), the operator norm is considered, and the convex hull is formed by taking all convex combinations of orthogonal matrices. The problem then is to prove that this convex hull equals the set of matrices with spectral norm ≤1.\n\nSo in the Assumption section, each line should state a single condition. Let's list them:\n\n1. Consider real matrices (since orthogonal matrices are real).\n2. The set of orthogonal matrices is considered (i.e., matrices Q where Q^T Q = I).\n3. The convex hull of this set is taken (i.e., all convex combinations of orthogonal matrices).\n4. The operator norm (spectral norm) is used for matrices.\n5. The target set consists of matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. Wait, the original problem says \"the convex hull of the set of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with norm not greater than one\". So the problem is to show that conv(O(n)) = { M | ||M|| ≤1 }, where O(n) is the orthogonal group.\n\nAssumptions needed:\n\n- The underlying field is real numbers (since orthogonal matrices are real).\n- The norm in question is the operator norm (spectral norm).\n- The convex hull is taken in the space of real matrices.\n\nBut the user's example had specific conditions on 'n'. Here, maybe the key is that the matrices are square, orthogonal, and the norm is operator norm. The problem is to prove that their convex hull equals the norm ≤1 matrices.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are real,\nMatrices are square,\nMatrices are orthogonal (Q^T Q = I),\nOperator norm (spectral norm) is considered,\nConvex hull is taken over the set of orthogonal matrices,\nThe target set consists of matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that the convex hull of orthogonal matrices equals the matrices with norm ≤1. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. The set considered is the set of orthogonal matrices (Q^T Q = I).\n2. The convex hull is formed by taking all convex combinations of these matrices.\n3. The operator norm (spectral norm) is used for matrices.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that this convex hull is equal to the set of matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nBut how to split these into individual lines? Each line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are orthogonal (i.e., Q^T Q = I),\nThe operator norm is considered for matrices,\nThe convex hull is taken over the set of orthogonal matrices,\nThe target set consists of matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show the equality, so the problem statement would be: Prove that the convex hull of the set of orthogonal matrices is equal to the set of matrices with operator norm not greater than one.\n\nBut the assumptions are the given conditions. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are real and square,\nMatrices are orthogonal (Q^T Q = I),\nThe operator norm (spectral norm) is used,\nConvex combinations are considered.\n\nBut the original question mentions \"the convex hull of the set of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with norm not greater than one\". The problem is to prove that equality. So the assumptions would include that we're working in the space of real square matrices with the operator norm, and considering their convex hull.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The underlying space consists of real square matrices.\n2. The operator norm (spectral norm) is considered.\n3. The convex hull is taken over the set of orthogonal matrices.\n\nThe problem then is to show that this convex hull equals the set of matrices with norm ≤1.\n\nIn the user's example, assumptions were listed as \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are real and square,\nMatrices are orthogonal (Q^T Q = I),\nOperator norm is used,\nConvex hull is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the convex hull of the set of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with operator norm not greater than one.\n\nBut maybe \"operator norm is used\" is part of the problem statement. Wait, the problem mentions \"norm as operators\", which is the operator norm. So yes, that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nConsider real square matrices,\nOrthogonal matrices satisfy Q^T Q = I,\nConvex hull is the set of all convex combinations,\nOperator norm (spectral norm) is considered,\nMatrices with operator norm ≤1 are considered.\n\nBut each line should be one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are real and square,\nMatrices are orthogonal (Q^T Q = I),\nThe operator norm (spectral norm) is used for matrices,\nThe convex hull is taken over the set of orthogonal matrices,\nThe target set consists of matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that the convex hull equals the target set. So perhaps the assumptions are the properties of the objects involved, not the conclusion. So the assumptions would be the definitions and conditions given in the problem.\n\nLet me think again. The problem states two parts: that a convex combination of orthogonal matrices has norm ≤1 (which is easy), and the reverse inclusion (every matrix with norm ≤1 is in the convex hull of orthogonal matrices), which is tricky.\n\nBut the user's task is to structure the problem as per the given format. The original problem is to find the proof that the convex hull of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with norm ≤1. So the problem is to prove that equality.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set of orthogonal matrices is considered,\nThe convex hull of this set is taken,\nThe operator norm is used,\nThe problem involves real square matrices.\n\nBut to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are real,\nMatrices are square,\nMatrices are orthogonal (Q^T Q = I),\nThe operator norm (spectral norm) is used,\nConvex hull is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the convex hull of the set of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with operator norm not greater than one.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement already includes some of these assumptions. The user's example included both the problem's assumptions and any additional constraints. In the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect, because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake. Because if the original problem was for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't add \"n is divisible by 7\". Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. So maybe the user's example is not accurate. But regardless, we need to follow their format.\n\nIn the example, the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a typo or the user made an error. But perhaps the example is intended to show that assumptions are extracted from the problem, even if redundant. For instance, if the problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then maybe another assumption is inferred, but in the example, it adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. Perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, we need to proceed.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The original question says: \"convex hull of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with norm not greater than one\". So the key elements are:\n\n- Orthogonal matrices: which are real, square, Q^T Q = I.\n- Convex hull: all convex combinations.\n- Operator norm (spectral norm).\n- Target set: matrices with norm ≤1.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are real,\nMatrices are square,\nMatrices are orthogonal (i.e., Q^T Q = I),\nThe operator norm (spectral norm) is considered,\nConvex hull is taken over the set of orthogonal matrices,\nThe problem involves proving equality between the convex hull and the set of matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions are the premises. Each line should be a single assumption. So:\n\n1. Matrices are real.\n2. Matrices are square.\n3. Matrices are orthogonal (Q^T Q = I).\n4. The operator norm (spectral norm) is used.\n5. The convex hull of a set is the set of all convex combinations of its elements.\n6. The target set consists of matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. For example, orthogonal matrices are inherently square and real. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are orthogonal (i.e., real square matrices satisfying Q^T Q = I),\nThe operator norm (spectral norm) is used,\nConvex hull is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the convex hull of the set of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with operator norm not greater than one.\n\nBut orthogonal matrices are by definition real and square, so that's covered in the first assumption. The operator norm is part of the problem's context. The convex hull is part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are real,\nMatrices are square,\nMatrices satisfy Q^T Q = I (orthogonal),\nOperator norm is considered,\nConvex combinations are considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the convex hull of orthogonal matrices equals the set of matrices with operator norm ≤1.\n\nThat seems better. Each assumption is a single property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nMatrices are real,\nMatrices are square,\nMatrices are orthogonal (Q^T Q = I),\nThe operator norm is used,\nConvex hull is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that the convex hull of the set of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with operator norm not greater than one.\n\nBut the problem says \"the convex hull of the set of orthogonal matrices is the set of matrices with norm not greater than one\". So the assumptions include that we are dealing with orthogonal matrices (which are real, square), using operator norm, and considering convex hull. The problem is to show equality to the set of norm ≤1 matrices.\n\nYes, that seems correct.",
