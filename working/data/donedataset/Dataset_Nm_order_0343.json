    "Content": "Can someone provide the proof of the special case of Fermat's Last Theorem for $n=3$, i.e., that \n$$\nx^3 + y^3 = z^3,\n$$ \nhas no positive integer solutions, as briefly as possible? I have seen some good proofs, but they are quite long (longer than a page) or use many variables. However, I would rather have an elementary long proof with many variables than a complex short proof. Edit. Even if the bounty expires I will award one to someone if they have a satisfying answer.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Main idea. The proof that follows is based on the infinite descent , i.e., we shall show that if $(x,y,z)$ is a solution, then there exists another triplet $(k,l,m)$ of smaller integers, which is also a solution, and this leads apparently to a contradiction. Assume instead that $x, y, z\\in\\mathbb Z\\smallsetminus\\{0\\}$ satisfy the equation (replacing $z$ by $-z$)\n$$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0,$$ \nwith $x, y$ and $z$ pairwise coprime. (Clearly at least one is negative.) One of them should be even, whereas the other two are odd. Assume $z$ to be even. Then $x$ and $y$ are odd. If $x = y$, then $2x^3 = −z^3$, and thus $x$ is also even, a contradiction. Hence $x\\ne y$. As $x$ and $y$ are odd, then $x+y$, $x-y$ are both even numbers. Let\n$$\n2u = x + y, \\quad 2v = x − y,\n$$\nwhere the non-zero integers $u$ and $v$ are also coprime and of different parity (one is even, the other odd), and \n$$\nx = u + v\\quad \\text{and}\\quad y = u − v.\n$$\nIt follows that\n$$\n−z^3 = (u + v)^3 + (u − v)^3 = 2u(u^2 + 3v^2). \\tag{1}\n$$\nSince $u$ and $v$ have different parity, $u^2 + 3v^2$ is an odd number. And since $z$ is even, then $u$ is even and $v$ is odd. Since $u$ and $v$ are coprime, then\n$$\n {\\mathrm{gcd}}\\,(2u,u^2 + 3v^2)={\\mathrm{gcd}}\\,(2u,3v^2)\\in\\{1,3\\}.\n$$ Case I. $\\,{\\mathrm{gcd}}\\,(2u,u^2 + 3v^2)=1$. In this case, the two factors of $−z^3$ in $(1)$ are coprime. This implies that $3\\not\\mid u$ and that both the two factors are perfect cubes of two smaller numbers, $r$ and $s$.\n$$\n2u = r^3\\quad\\text{and}\\quad u^2 + 3v^2 = s^3.\n$$\nAs $u^2 + 3v^2$ is odd, so is $s$. We now need the following result: Lemma. If $\\mathrm{gcd}\\,(a,b)=1$, then every odd factor of $a^2 + 3b^2$ has this same form. Proof. See here. Thus, if $s$ is odd and if it satisfies an equation $s^3 = u^2 + 3v^2$, then it can be written in terms of two coprime integers $e$ and $f$ as\n$$\ns = e^2 + 3f^2,\n$$\nso that\n$$\nu = e ( e^2 − 9f^2) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\nv = 3f ( e^2 − f^2).\n$$\nSince $u$ is even and $v$ odd, then $e$ is even and $f$ is odd. Since\n$$\nr^3 = 2u = 2e (e − 3f)(e + 3f),\n$$\nthe factors $2e$, $(e–3f )$, and $(e+3f )$ are coprime since $3$ cannot divide $e$. \nIf $3\\mid e$, then $3\\mid u$, violating the fact that $u$ and $v$ are coprime. Since the three factors on the right-hand side are coprime, they must individually equal cubes of smaller integers\n$$\n−2e = k^3,\\,\\,\\,\ne − 3f = l^3,\\,\\,\\,\ne + 3f = m^3,\n$$\nwhich yields a smaller solution $k^3 + l^3 + m^3= 0$. Therefore, by the argument of infinite descent, the original solution $(x, y, z)$ was impossible. Case II. $\\,{\\mathrm{gcd}}\\,(2u,u^2 + 3v^2)=3$. In this case, the greatest common divisor of $2u$ and $u^2 + 3v^2$ is $3$. \nThat implies that $3\\mid u$, and one may express $u = 3w$ in terms of a smaller integer, $w$. Since $4\\mid u$, so is $w$; hence, $w$ is also even. Since $u$ and $v$ are coprime, \nso are $v$ and $w$. Therefore, neither $3$ nor $4$ divide $v$. Substituting $u$ by $w$ in $(1)$ we obtain\n$$\n−z^3 = 6w(9w^2 + 3v^2) = 18w(3w^2 + v^2)\n$$\nBecause $v$ and $w$ are coprime, and because $3\\not\\mid v$, then $18w$ and $3w^2 + v^2$ \nare also coprime. Therefore, since their product is a cube, they are each the cube of \nsmaller integers, $r$ and $s$:\n$$\n18w = r^3 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n3w^2 + v^2 = s^3.\n$$\nBy the same lemma, as $s$ is odd and equal to a number of the form $3w^2 + v^2$, \nit too can be expressed in terms of smaller coprime numbers, $e$ and $f$:\n$$\ns = e^2 + 3f^2.\n$$\nA straight-forward calculation shows that\n$$\nv = e (e^2 − 9f^2) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad w = 3f (e^2 − f^2).\n$$\nThus, $e$ is odd and $f$ is even, because $v$ is odd. The expression for $18w$ then becomes\n$$\nr^3 = 18w = 54f (e^2 − f^2) = 54f (e + f) (e − f) = 3^3 \\times 2f (e + f) (e − f).\n$$\nSince $3^3$ divides $r^3$ we have that $3$ divides $r$, so $(r /3)^3$ is an integer \nthat equals $2f (e + f) (e − f)$. Since $e$ and $f$ are coprime, so are the three factors $2e$, $e+f$, and $e−f$; therefore, they are each the cube of smaller integers, $k$, $l$, and $m$.\n$$\n−2e = k^3,\\,\\,\\,\ne + f = l^3,\\,\\,\\,\ne − f = m^3,\n$$\nwhich yields a smaller solution $k^3 + l^3 + m^3= 0$. Therefore, by the argument of infinite descent, the original solution $(x, y, z)$ was impossible. Note. See also here.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no positive integer solutions, which is a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem for n=3. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, they mentioned that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. \n\nLooking at the current problem, the equation x³ + y³ = z³ is supposed to have no positive integer solutions. The problem statement itself is about proving that. So what are the assumptions here? The variables x, y, z are positive integers. The equation is x³ + y³ = z³. The goal is to show no solutions exist. So the assumptions would be that x, y, z are positive integers. Each of these variables is an object, so each should have their own line. Wait, but in the example, they listed assumptions about n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. So perhaps each assumption is a separate condition. Here, the problem is to prove that there are no positive integer solutions. So the assumptions would be:\n\nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\nz is a positive integer,\nand the equation x³ + y³ = z³ holds.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that no such solutions exist. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included conditions on n, and then the problem was to prove something about A(n). So in this case, the problem is to show that under the assumptions that x, y, z are positive integers, the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no solutions. But wait, the user's example included assumptions that were given as part of the problem. However, in the original problem statement here, the user is asking for a proof that there are no solutions, so the assumptions would be that x, y, z are positive integers and that they satisfy the equation. But since the problem is to show that such solutions cannot exist, perhaps the assumptions are just that x, y, z are positive integers, and the problem is to show that x³ + y³ = z³ has no solutions under those assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", and the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps in this case, the problem is \"Prove that x³ + y³ = z³ has no positive integer solutions\", and the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. But in the original problem statement, there are no additional conditions except that x, y, z are positive integers. So the assumptions would be each variable being a positive integer. So each variable (x, y, z) is a positive integer, and the equation holds. Wait, but the equation is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the example had the problem statement include the equation A(n) and the assumptions were about n. Here, the problem is to prove that the equation has no solutions, so perhaps the assumptions are just that x, y, z are positive integers. Then the problem is to show that x³ + y³ = z³ has no solutions under those assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is part of the problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in that case, the assumptions were about n's properties, and the problem was to prove something about A(n). Similarly, here the problem is to prove that the equation has no solutions, so the assumptions are that x, y, z are positive integers. So each assumption would be \"x is a positive integer\", \"y is a positive integer\", \"z is a positive integer\". Then the problem is to prove that x³ + y³ = z³ has no solutions. However, the original problem statement says \"has no positive integer solutions\", so maybe the equation is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions are the variables being positive integers, and the problem is the equation having no solutions. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a positive integer,\n\nAssumption: y is a positive integer,\n\nAssumption: z is a positive integer,\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no solutions.\n\nBut wait, the user's example had the problem statement include the equation. In their example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem would be \"Prove that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no positive integer solutions.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation itself is part of the problem statement, and the assumptions are the variables being positive integers. Let me check the example again. The example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\", and the assumptions were about n. So in this case, the problem is \"Prove that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no positive integer solutions\", and the assumptions are that x, y, z are positive integers. Wait, but the problem statement is about showing that there are no such solutions, so perhaps the equation is part of the problem, and the assumptions are the variables' domains. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a positive integer,\n\nAssumption: y is a positive integer,\n\nAssumption: z is a positive integer,\n\nProblem: Prove that x³ + y³ = z³ has no solutions.\n\nAlternatively, the equation could be part of the problem. Let me think. The example's problem included the expression A(n) = ... in the problem statement. So here, the equation x³ + y³ = z³ would be part of the problem statement, and the assumptions are the variables being positive integers. Therefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption: x is a positive integer,\n\nAssumption: y is a positive integer,\n\nAssumption: z is a positive integer,\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no solutions.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wrote: \"the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no positive integer solutions\". So the problem is to prove that. So the assumptions are the variables being positive integers, and the problem is the equation having no solutions. Therefore, the formatted answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: x is a positive integer,\nAssumption: y is a positive integer,\nAssumption: z is a positive integer,\nProblem: Prove that the equation $$x^3 + y^3 = z^3$$ has no solutions.\n###\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"has no positive integer solutions\", which is the same as saying that there are no positive integers x, y, z satisfying the equation. So the problem is to prove that under the assumptions that x, y, z are positive integers, the equation has no solution. Therefore, this formatting is correct.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is on its own line and addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. Here, each variable (x, y, z) is a positive integer, so each gets its own assumption line. The problem is to show that the equation has no solutions under these assumptions.",
