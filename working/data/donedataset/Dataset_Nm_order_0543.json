    "AcceptedAnswer": "I use $\\cdot$ to denote AND and $+$ to denote OR. $a \\oplus b$ is given by $a\\cdot\\bar{b}+b\\cdot\\bar{a}$. Do you see why? Do you see why this is commutative? For associativity, you want to show that $(a \\oplus b)  \\oplus c=a  \\oplus (b  \\oplus c)$. The left side expands as $$(a  \\oplus b)\\cdot\\bar{c}+\\overline{(a  \\oplus b)}\\cdot c$$\n$$(a\\cdot\\bar{b}+b\\cdot\\bar{a})\\cdot\\bar{c}+\\overline{(a\\cdot\\bar{b}+b\\cdot\\bar{a})}\\cdot c$$ Use the rules of boolean algebra (Demorgan's Laws, Distributive laws etc.) to expand this out. Then do the same for the other side, and show the expansions are equal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help the user structure this problem about proving that XOR is commutative and associative using Boolean algebra. Let me start by understanding the original question.\n\nThe user wants to show that XOR (⊕) is both commutative and associative without using a truth table, but instead using Boolean algebra. They mentioned they're not sure how to approach this with Boolean algebra, so my task is to break down the problem into assumptions and the problem statement following the given format.\n\nFirst, let's recall what commutative and associative mean. Commutative means a ⊕ b = b ⊕ a for all a, b. Associative means (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c) for all a, b, c. \n\nIn Boolean algebra, XOR can be defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b). Alternatively, using algebraic expressions, XOR can be represented in terms of addition modulo 2, where a ⊕ b = a + b - 2ab, but in Boolean terms, it's more about the combination of AND, OR, and NOT operations.\n\nNow, the assumptions. The problem is about Boolean algebra, so the variables involved are Boolean variables, meaning they can be either 0 or 1. Also, the operations are the standard Boolean operations: AND, OR, NOT. The XOR operator itself is defined in terms of these operations. \n\nHowever, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So for commutative, we need to consider that the operator applies to two elements, and for associative, three elements. But perhaps the key assumption here is that we're working within Boolean algebra, so all variables are Boolean, and the operations follow Boolean algebra rules.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the user's problem doesn't have such numeric constraints. Instead, the context is Boolean algebra, so the assumptions would relate to the properties of the variables and operations in Boolean algebra.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should state that the variables a, b, c are Boolean (i.e., they can be 0 or 1), and that the XOR operation is defined as per Boolean algebra. However, since the problem is to prove commutativity and associativity, perhaps the assumptions are that a, b, c are elements of a Boolean algebra, and that the XOR operation is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b). But maybe the problem expects using the basic Boolean algebra axioms to derive commutativity and associativity, rather than assuming the definition of XOR. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that we're using the standard Boolean algebra operations. But since the problem is about proving commutativity and associativity of XOR using Boolean algebra, the main assumptions would be the definitions and properties of XOR within Boolean algebra. However, in standard Boolean algebra, XOR isn't a primitive operation; it's derived from AND, OR, and NOT. So the user needs to use the axioms of Boolean algebra to manipulate the expressions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be that the variables are Boolean (taking values 0 or 1), and that the XOR operation is defined using the standard Boolean operations. But each assumption line should address one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are Boolean variables,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b),\nBoolean algebra axioms apply (like commutativity, associativity, distributivity of ∧ and ∨, etc.).\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove commutativity and associativity of XOR, so we can't assume that XOR is commutative or associative. Instead, the assumptions should be the definitions and the axioms of Boolean algebra for the basic operations (AND, OR, NOT). So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nAll variables are elements of a Boolean algebra,\nThe XOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (¬a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ ¬b),\nThe operations ∧, ∨, ¬ satisfy the axioms of Boolean algebra.\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property. So splitting them:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are elements of a Boolean algebra,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b),\nThe operations ∧ (AND) and ∨ (OR) are commutative,\nThe operations ∧ and ∨ are associative,\nThe operations ∧ and ∨ distribute over each other,\nThe complement ¬a satisfies a ∧ ¬a = 0 and a ∨ ¬a = 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove commutativity and associativity of XOR, so we can't assume that ∧ and ∨ are commutative and associative unless those are given as part of the Boolean algebra axioms. Since the user is supposed to use Boolean algebra to prove XOR's properties, the assumptions would include the standard axioms of Boolean algebra for ∧, ∨, ¬, and the definition of XOR in terms of those.\n\nBut perhaps the user is expected to use the basic properties of Boolean algebra (like commutativity, associativity, distributivity of AND and OR) to derive the properties for XOR. Therefore, the assumptions are that the variables are in a Boolean algebra, and the definition of XOR is given in terms of AND, OR, and NOT. The axioms of Boolean algebra (commutativity, associativity, distributivity, complements, etc.) for the basic operations are assumed.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are elements of a Boolean algebra,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b),\nThe AND operator ∧ is commutative and associative,\nThe OR operator ∨ is commutative and associative,\nThe AND operator distributes over OR,\nThe OR operator distributes over AND,\nFor any element a, a ∧ ¬a = 0 and a ∨ ¬a = 1.\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property. So split them:\n\nAssumption:\na is an element of a Boolean algebra,\nb is an element of a Boolean algebra,\nc is an element of a Boolean algebra,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b),\nAND operator ∧ is commutative,\nOR operator ∨ is commutative,\nAND operator ∧ is associative,\nOR operator ∨ is associative,\nAND operator ∧ distributes over OR operator ∨,\nOR operator ∨ distributes over AND operator ∧,\nFor any element a, a ∧ ¬a = 0,\nFor any element a, a ∨ ¬a = 1.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be grouped, but according to the example given, each assumption is a single line. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So similarly, each property here should be separate.\n\nBut variables a, b, c being elements of Boolean algebra can be three separate lines? Or maybe grouped as \"a, b, c are elements of a Boolean algebra\". The example had \"n is an integer\" as one line, so perhaps \"a, b, c are elements of a Boolean algebra\" as one assumption line.\n\nThen, the definition of XOR, then each Boolean algebra axiom as separate lines. However, the user's problem is to prove commutativity and associativity of XOR, so the axioms related to commutativity and associativity of AND and OR are necessary, as well as distributivity and complement properties.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't need all those axioms listed, as the question is about using Boolean algebra, so the assumptions are that we can use the standard axioms of Boolean algebra (commutativity, associativity, distributivity, etc. for AND and OR) and the definition of XOR. The variables being Boolean is implicit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is that we're working in a Boolean algebra where the basic operations have their standard properties, and XOR is defined as usual. But to match the example's structure, perhaps the assumptions are simply:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are Boolean variables,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined using Boolean algebra.\n\nBut that might be too vague. The example had specific conditions on n. In this case, the critical assumptions are that the variables are Boolean and that XOR is defined in terms of Boolean operations. The rest are part of the Boolean algebra framework which the user is allowed to use.\n\nBut to be precise, following the example's style, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na and b are Boolean variables,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∨ b) ∧ ¬(a ∧ b).\n\nWait, but another definition of XOR is (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b). Which is equivalent to the above. So maybe specify the definition used.\n\nBut the problem is about using Boolean algebra to show commutativity and associativity. So the user needs to start from the definition of XOR and apply Boolean algebra axioms.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the assumptions that a, b, c are Boolean variables, and the definition of XOR. Then the problem is to prove commutativity and associativity.\n\nBut the example in the user's prompt had assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each line is a single condition. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na is a Boolean variable,\nb is a Boolean variable,\nc is a Boolean variable,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b).\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that ⊕ is commutative and associative using Boolean algebra.\n\nBut the user's original question also mentions that they can use a truth table but want to use Boolean algebra. So the problem is structured to use Boolean algebra properties.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a Boolean variable,\nb is a Boolean variable,\nc is a Boolean variable,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the XOR operator ⊕ is both commutative and associative using Boolean algebra.\n\nAlternatively, if the definition is different, but I think that's the standard way to define XOR in Boolean algebra terms.\n\nWait, another way to write XOR is a ⊕ b = (a ∨ b) ∧ ¬(a ∧ b). Let me verify:\n\n(a ∨ b) ∧ ¬(a ∧ b) is equivalent to (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b). Let's check:\n\nUsing distributive law: (a ∨ b) ∧ (¬a ∨ ¬b) = [a ∧ (¬a ∨ ¬b)] ∨ [b ∧ (¬a ∨ ¬b)] = (a ∧ ¬a) ∨ (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (b ∧ ¬a) ∨ (b ∧ ¬b) = 0 ∨ (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b) ∨ 0 = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b). So yes, both definitions are equivalent.\n\nSo whichever definition is used, the result is the same. The user might have either definition, but since the problem is to use Boolean algebra, either form can be used. However, for clarity, perhaps use the (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b) definition as it's more straightforward for applying Boolean algebra axioms.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem as per the required format:\n\nAssumption:\na is a Boolean variable,\nb is a Boolean variable,\nc is a Boolean variable,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the XOR operator ⊕ is both commutative and associative using Boolean algebra.\n\nBut the example in the user's instruction had for the problem line: \"Prove that $$A(n) = ...$$ is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, the problem line should state exactly what needs to be proven. So here, the problem is to prove that XOR is commutative and associative. Therefore, the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\na is a Boolean variable,\nb is a Boolean variable,\nc is a Boolean variable,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the XOR operator ⊕ is both commutative and associative.\n\nBut perhaps the definition of XOR is part of the problem statement? Wait, in the example, the definition of A(n) was part of the problem statement. However, the user's original question mentions \"through the use of Boolean algebra, show that XOR operator ⊕ is both commutative and associative\". So the problem statement is as given, and the assumptions would include the variables being Boolean and the definition of XOR.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the definition of XOR is part of the problem, but in the example, the definition of A(n) was in the problem statement. So perhaps here, the problem statement should include the definition of XOR. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included the definition of A(n) in the problem statement. So following that, perhaps the problem statement here should include the definition of XOR.\n\nTherefore:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the XOR operator ⊕ defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b) is both commutative and associative using Boolean algebra.\n\nBut then the assumptions would be the variables are Boolean. Wait, the example had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem statement included the definition of A(n). So here, the assumptions are that a, b, c are Boolean variables, and the problem statement includes the definition of XOR.\n\nAlternatively, the definition of XOR could be part of the assumptions. Let me think.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about n: being an integer and divisible by 7. The problem statement then included the expression for A(n). So in this case, the assumptions should be about the variables (being Boolean), and the problem statement includes the operator's definition.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are Boolean variables.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the XOR operator ⊕ defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b) is both commutative and associative using Boolean algebra.\n\nBut the example had each assumption on a separate line. If \"a, b, c are Boolean variables\" is considered one assumption, that's okay. Alternatively, split into:\n\nAssumption:\na is a Boolean variable,\nb is a Boolean variable,\nc is a Boolean variable.\n\nBut maybe the user example grouped similar assumptions. In the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate, but they both apply to n. Here, a, b, c are all Boolean variables, so perhaps three separate lines. But that's redundant. The example didn't have multiple variables, but if the problem involves multiple variables, perhaps each variable's type is an assumption. Alternatively, the first assumption could be \"a, b, c are Boolean variables\" as one line.\n\nBut looking back at the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem was about A(n) with n being an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted assumption was:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate condition, even if they apply to the same variable. Therefore, in the XOR problem, if a, b, c are Boolean variables, perhaps each is listed as a separate assumption:\n\nAssumption:\na is a Boolean variable,\nb is a Boolean variable,\nc is a Boolean variable,\nXOR operator ⊕ is defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the XOR operator ⊕ is both commutative and associative using Boolean algebra.\n\nAlternatively, if the definition of XOR is part of the problem statement, then:\n\nAssumption:\na is a Boolean variable,\nb is a Boolean variable,\nc is a Boolean variable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the XOR operator ⊕ defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b) is both commutative and associative using Boolean algebra.\n\nThis seems more aligned with the example where the expression for A(n) was in the problem statement. So the definition of XOR is part of the problem to be proven, not an assumption. Wait, no. In the example, the definition of A(n) was part of the problem statement, but the assumptions about n were separate. Here, the definition of XOR is necessary to state what operator we're talking about. Therefore, including the definition in the problem statement makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the definition of XOR is considered an assumption, then it's part of the assumptions. But the example included the expression for A(n) in the problem statement, not in the assumptions. Therefore, in this case, the definition of XOR should be in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\na is a Boolean variable,\nb is a Boolean variable,\nc is a Boolean variable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the XOR operator ⊕ defined as a ⊕ b = (a ∧ ¬b) ∨ (¬a ∧ b) is both commutative and associative using Boolean algebra.\n\nThis follows the example's structure where the problem statement includes the definition of the object (A(n)) and the assumptions are about the variables involved (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the variables a, b, c are Boolean, and the problem statement defines XOR and asks to prove its properties.\n\nHence, the final answer should be structured as such.",
