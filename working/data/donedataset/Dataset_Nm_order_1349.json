    "Content": "This is a problem in Hartshorne concerning showing that the image of $\\Bbb{P}^n \\times \\Bbb{P}^m$ under the Segre embedding $\\psi$ is actually irreducible. Now I have shown with some effort that $\\psi(\\Bbb{P}^n \\times \\Bbb{P}^m)$ is actually equal to $V(\\mathfrak{a})$ where $\\mathfrak{a}$ is the ideal generated  by the set of all monomials $$\\Big\\{z_{ij}z_{kl} - z_{il}z_{kj} \\hspace{1mm} \\Big| \\hspace{1mm} i,k = 0,\\ldots, n; \\hspace{2mm} j,l = 0,\\ldots,m\\Big\\}.$$ My main problem now is in showing that $\\mathfrak{a}$ is actually equal to the kernel of the ring homomorphism $$\\varphi : k[z_{ij}] \\to k[x_0,\\ldots,x_n,y_0,\\ldots,y_m]$$ that sends $z_{ij}$ to $x_iy_j$ . I have spent quite a few hours playing around with monomial orderings and trying to show that $\\mathfrak{a} \\supseteq \\ker \\varphi$ but to no avail. Of course, the other inclusion is immediate. Is there anything I can do apart from playing around with monomial orderings to try and show that the kernel of $\\varphi$ is equal to $\\mathfrak{a}$ ? Perhaps maybe something along the lines of inducting on $n$ , though this does not look promising. Note: Please do not close this question; my question differs from the other questions on this site concerning the Segre embedding. Also, I can show my work concerning how I arrived at the conclusion that $V(\\mathfrak{a}) = \\psi(\\Bbb{P}^n \\times \\Bbb{P}^n)$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Indeed as Nils Matthes suggested we don't know need to go through such a mess and just use the hint of Hartshorne. Define a map $\\varphi : k[T_{00} , \\ldots, T_{nm}] \\to k[X_0,\\ldots,X_n,Y_0,\\ldots,Y_m]$ that sends $T_{ij}$ to $X_iY_j$. Let $\\mathfrak{a} := \\ker \\varphi$. We claim that $\\psi (\\Bbb{P}^n \\times \\Bbb{P}^m) = V(\\mathfrak{a})$. For one inclusion if a point \n$$a = [a_{00} : \\ldots : a_{nm}] \\in V(\\mathfrak{a})$$ \nthen in particular $a$ is a zero of all the polynomials $T_{ij}T_{kl} - T_{il}T_{kj}$. But this means that $a \\in \\psi(\\Bbb{P}^n \\times \\Bbb{P}^m)$. The reverse inclusion follows immediately from the definition of $\\varphi$. Thus $V(\\mathfrak{a}) = \\psi(\\Bbb{P}^n \\times \\Bbb{P}^m)$ and the projective Nullstellensatz implies that $\\psi(\\Bbb{P}^n \\times \\Bbb{P}^m)$ is a projective variety.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about showing that the kernel of the ring homomorphism φ is equal to the ideal 𝔞 generated by those quadratic monomials z_ij z_kl - z_il z_kj. They mentioned they already know that 𝔞 is contained in the kernel, which makes sense because when you apply φ to z_ij z_kl - z_il z_kj, you get x_i y_j x_k y_l - x_i y_l x_k y_j, which cancels out. So that inclusion is clear.\n\nThe hard part is showing the reverse inclusion, that the kernel of φ is contained in 𝔞. The user has tried using monomial orderings without success. Maybe they tried Gröbner basis techniques? Let me recall that to show two ideals are equal, one approach is to show each is contained in the other. Since they have one inclusion, they need the other. \n\nAnother thought: maybe the First Isomorphism Theorem? If φ is surjective, then k[z_ij]/ker φ is isomorphic to the image, which is the coordinate ring of the Segre variety. If we can show that k[z_ij]/𝔞 is also isomorphic to the same ring, then since 𝔞 is contained in ker φ, they must be equal. But does the user know that 𝔞 is prime? If 𝔞 is prime, and ker φ is a prime ideal containing 𝔞, but since the quotient by 𝔞 is the coordinate ring of the Segre variety which is an integral domain, then 𝔞 is prime. Therefore, if ker φ is also prime and contains 𝔞, but maybe that's circular.\n\nWait, the Segre embedding is an isomorphism onto its image, which is projective variety, hence the ideal of the image should be exactly ker φ. But the user already showed that the image is V(𝔞). So if the image is V(𝔞), then the ideal of the image is I(V(𝔞)), which by Nullstellensatz is the radical of 𝔞. But since we are over an algebraically closed field and 𝔞 is a prime ideal (if it is), then I(V(𝔞)) would be 𝔞 itself. But the kernel of φ is the ideal defining the Segre variety, so if V(𝔞) is the Segre variety, then I(V(𝔞)) should be the kernel. Therefore, kernel is equal to I(V(𝔞)) = 𝔞 if 𝔞 is radical. But the user is working in a polynomial ring, so maybe 𝔞 is radical. Alternatively, perhaps 𝔞 is already the defining ideal, hence equal to the kernel.\n\nBut the user is in the process of showing that 𝔞 equals the kernel. Maybe a different approach: since φ is surjective (because every monomial x_i y_j is hit by z_ij), so the coordinate ring is k[z_ij]/ker φ. If they can show that k[z_ij]/𝔞 is isomorphic to the same ring, then 𝔞 must equal ker φ. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that 𝔞 is generated by all the 2x2 minors of the matrix (z_ij), which is the standard definition of the Segre ideal. Then perhaps in commutative algebra, it's known that these minors generate the prime ideal defining the Segre variety. But maybe the user is supposed to prove this from scratch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps induction. Suppose for smaller n and m, the statement holds. But the user mentioned induction might not look promising. Maybe use the fact that any polynomial in ker φ can be written as a combination of the generators of 𝔞. Since φ maps z_ij to x_i y_j, any relation among the x_i y_j must come from the relations z_ij z_kl = z_il z_kj. So perhaps any polynomial in ker φ must be a combination of these quadratic relations. Maybe use a substitution or grading argument. For example, the ring k[z_ij]/𝔞 is graded, and φ is a graded map. So maybe consider homogeneous polynomials in the kernel. If a homogeneous polynomial is in ker φ, then all its monomials, when mapped, must cancel. So maybe use a term order where you can reduce any such polynomial modulo the generators of 𝔞 to zero. But the user tried monomial orderings. Maybe they need to use a specific order, like the lex order, and perform division algorithm. But that might be tedious. Alternatively, use the fact that the Segre embedding is projectively normal, so the kernel is generated by the quadratic relations. But that might be a more advanced approach. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the tensor product of the homogeneous coordinate rings of P^n and P^m is the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Segre embedding, hence the kernel is generated by the relations z_ij z_kl = z_il z_kj. But this is getting into more algebraic geometry concepts. Perhaps the user needs to consider that the kernel is generated by the relations that make the multiplication in the tensor product commutative. Hmm. I think the key idea is that the relations z_ij z_kl - z_il z_kj generate all the relations among the x_i y_j, so any polynomial that vanishes when z_ij is replaced by x_i y_j must be a combination of these. But how to make this precise? Maybe use a basis argument. For example, the monomials in k[z_ij] that are not divisible by any leading term of the generators of 𝔞 would map to a basis of the quotient ring, which should correspond to the monomials in x_i y_j. Since φ is surjective, the monomials in x_i y_j form a basis for the target ring. If the standard monomials (those not in the initial ideal of 𝔞) map to this basis, then by the diamond lemma, the quotient k[z_ij]/𝔞 has a basis given by those standard monomials, which matches the target ring, hence 𝔞 must be the kernel. This would require showing that the initial terms of 𝔞 form a Gröbner basis, which might be what the user tried with monomial orderings. If they couldn't get it to work, maybe they need to choose a specific monomial order, like the lex order, or perhaps a diagonal order, and show that the S-polynomials reduce to zero. Alternatively, use the fact that the generators form a Gröbner basis under a certain order, hence generating the ideal. But maybe the user needs to look up the proof that the Segre ideal is generated by the 2x2 minors and that they form a Gröbner basis. Since the user is working through Hartshorne, this might be a standard result. However, since the user is stuck, perhaps suggest an alternative approach. Maybe use induction on the number of variables, or use dimension arguments. The Segre variety has dimension n + m, and the coordinate ring k[z_ij]/𝔞 should have the same dimension, which is n + m + 1 (wait, no, the projective variety has dimension n + m, so the affine cone would have dimension n + m + 1, but the coordinate ring here is the homogeneous coordinate ring, so the Krull dimension would be n + m + 1). On the other hand, the kernel of φ is a prime ideal whose quotient has dimension equal to the dimension of the Segre variety plus one, which is n + m + 1. Since 𝔞 is contained in ker φ, and if they have the same dimension, they must be equal. But I think this is a bit hand-wavy. Alternatively, use the fact that both ideals are prime and have the same height, hence must be equal. But to compute the height, need to know that the Segre ideal is generated by the right number of minors. This might require more advanced commutative algebra. Since the user is looking for an elementary approach, maybe stick to the initial idea of Gröbner bases. Alternatively, consider writing an arbitrary element of ker φ as a combination of the generators. Take a polynomial f in ker φ, so φ(f) = 0. Then f can be written as a combination of z_ij z_kl - z_il z_kj. Maybe use the substitution φ(z_ij) = x_i y_j and express f in terms of these, then see that the relations must come from those quadratics. But I'm not sure. Maybe use the fact that the relations are the only relations needed. For example, any relation among the x_i y_j must come from switching the order of multiplication, which is captured by those quadratic relations. So perhaps use a combinatorial argument, arranging the variables in a grid and showing that any monomial can be rewritten using the relations to a standard form, hence the kernel is generated by those relations. This might be similar to the argument for the Plücker relations. Alternatively, use the fact that the Segre embedding is defined by those relations, so the kernel must be exactly 𝔞. But I think the user needs a more concrete approach. Maybe use a double induction on the degrees of the polynomials. For example, take a homogeneous polynomial in ker φ of degree d. Show that it can be expressed as a combination of the quadratic relations. For d=2, it's clear, since the kernel in degree 2 is exactly the span of the relations. Then assume for degree less than d, and try to decompose the polynomial. But how? Maybe use the fact that any monomial in x_i y_j corresponds to a product of variables z_{i_1 j_1} z_{i_2 j_2} ... which can be reordered using the relations to a standard form, hence any difference in the ordering would be an element of 𝔞. Therefore, any polynomial in the kernel would be a combination of these differences, hence in 𝔞. This is similar to the straightening laws in algebraic combinatorics. But I need to formalize this. For example, if we have a monomial in z_ij's, when mapped to x_i y_j's, the order of multiplication doesn't matter because the x's and y's commute. So any two monomials in z_ij's that map to the same monomial in x_i y_j's can be connected by a sequence of relations that swap two adjacent z's. Each swap corresponds to a generator of 𝔞. Therefore, the difference of these two monomials is in 𝔞. Hence, any polynomial in ker φ can be written as a sum of such differences, hence is in 𝔞. This seems plausible. For example, suppose you have a monomial z_{i1 j1} z_{i2 j2} ... z_{id jd}. If you rearrange the order of the z's, the image under φ is the same because multiplication in k[x_i, y_j] is commutative. However, in the polynomial ring k[z_ij], swapping two variables would require a relation. For instance, z_{i1 j1} z_{i2 j2} - z_{i2 j2} z_{i1 j1} is not necessarily in 𝔞 unless they are in the form covered by the generators. Wait, but the generators are of the form z_{ij} z_{kl} - z_{il} z_{kj} where i ≤ k and j ≤ l or something. Maybe need to define a monomial order where you can sort the variables and express any monomial as a standard monomial modulo 𝔞. For example, order the z_ij lex order based on their indices, and then each monomial can be rewritten by swapping adjacent variables using the relations to reach a standard form. If two monomials map to the same image, their difference is in 𝔞. Therefore, the kernel is generated by these differences, which are exactly the generators of 𝔞. This is similar to the Hodge algebra or standard monomial theory. Therefore, the conclusion is that ker φ is indeed equal to 𝔞. So the key idea is that any relation in the kernel must come from swapping variables using the quadratic relations, hence the kernel is generated by those relations. Therefore, the answer should structure the problem by noting the assumptions and the main problem.",
