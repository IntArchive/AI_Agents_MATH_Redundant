    "Content": "Could anyone explain to me why maximal ideals are prime? I'm approaching it like this, let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$ and let $A$ be a maximal ideal. Let $a,b\\in R:ab\\in A$ . I'm trying to construct an ideal $B$ such that $A\\subset B \\neq A$ As this would be a contradiction. An alternative idea I had was to prove that $R/A$ is an integral domain, but this reduces to the same problem. EDIT: Ergh.. just realized that I've learnt a theorem that states is $A$ is a maximal ideal then $R/A$ is a field",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $A$ be a maximal ideal. Then $R/A$ contains no proper ideals, by the correspondence theorem. Indeed, $R/A$ is a field (assuming that $R$ contains an identity). Hence, $A$ is a prime ideal. Theorem. $R/A$ is a field. Proof. Let $i+A\\in R/A$ such that $i+A\\neq 0+A$ . We want to prove that $i+A$ is a unit. So set $B=A+Ri=\\{a+ri: a\\in A, r\\in R\\}$ . Now, you (yourself!) need to prove that $B$ is an ideal, and that $A\\subset B$ properly. Since $A$ is maximal this means that $B=R$ . As $B=R$ we have $1 \\in B$ , hence there exists some $a\\in A, r\\in R$ such that $a + ri = 1$ . Then $1+A=(a+ri)+A=ri+A=(r+A)(i+A)$ , and so $i+A$ is a unit, as required. QED",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question titled \"Why are maximal ideals prime?\" into the specified format. Let me read through the original question again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking for an explanation of why maximal ideals are prime. They mention approaching it by considering a commutative ring R with 1, a maximal ideal A, and elements a, b in R such that ab is in A. They tried constructing an ideal B containing A properly, which would contradict maximality, or alternatively showing R/A is an integral domain, which they realized is a field due to a theorem they learned.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is set in a commutative ring with 1, since the user specifies \"let R be a commutative ring with 1\". The maximal ideal A is given. The elements a and b are in R with their product ab in A. The user is trying to show that either a or b is in A, which would make A prime.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. R is a commutative ring. (They state \"commutative ring with 1\", so commutative is one property.)\n2. R has a multiplicative identity 1. (Another property of the ring.)\n3. A is a maximal ideal of R. (Given in the problem statement.)\n4. Elements a and b belong to R. (Given as part of the setup.)\n5. The product ab belongs to A. (Condition to check for primality.)\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that maximal ideals are prime. So the actual problem is to prove that if A is a maximal ideal in R (commutative with 1), then A is a prime ideal. The user's approach involves elements a, b with ab in A, and needing to show a or b is in A.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking why maximal ideals are prime, given that R/A is a field (since they recall the theorem that R/A is a field when A is maximal). So perhaps the key assumptions are about the ring being commutative with 1 and A being maximal. The elements a, b are part of the proof setup but maybe not part of the problem's explicit assumptions. Wait, the problem is to show that any maximal ideal is prime. So the problem's assumptions would be the ring is commutative with 1, A is a maximal ideal. The problem is to prove A is prime.\n\nWait, in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the problem as structured, the user included that as an assumption. However, in the Math Stack Exchange question here, the user is not adding extra conditions but asking about a general property. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- R is a commutative ring with 1.\n- A is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that A is a prime ideal.\n\nBut the user's approach involves taking a, b in R with ab in A, and trying to show a or b is in A. So maybe in the assumptions, we need to include that a and b are elements of R such that ab is in A, but that might be part of the problem statement. Wait, the problem to prove is that A is prime, which by definition requires that for any a, b in R, if ab is in A, then a is in A or b is in A. So the problem is: given that A is maximal, show that A is prime, i.e., for all a, b in R, if ab ∈ A, then a ∈ A or b ∈ A.\n\nSo the assumptions should include the ring properties and A being maximal, and the problem is to show A is prime. But in the example, the user included specific elements and their conditions as assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7; maybe that was a mistake in the example? Wait, no, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem requires that n satisfies some divisibility conditions? Wait, perhaps the example given by the user was an incorrect formatting. Hmm. That could complicate things.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's example, perhaps the assumptions should list all the given conditions. In the current problem, the user is working in a commutative ring with 1, A is a maximal ideal, and they consider elements a and b such that ab is in A. The problem is to show that A is prime, i.e., that either a or b is in A. But in the problem statement, the user is asking \"why are maximal ideals prime?\" So the problem is to prove that maximal ideals in a commutative ring with 1 are prime.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is a commutative ring.\n- R has a multiplicative identity 1.\n- A is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is a prime ideal.\n\nBut the user's own approach includes elements a, b with ab ∈ A, trying to show a ∈ A or b ∈ A. But perhaps in the formatted problem, the problem statement is \"Prove that A is a prime ideal\" and the assumptions are about R and A. However, in the example, the problem was restated with the same expression but included the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But maybe the user wants to extract all conditions given in the problem, even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption says n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would mean the problem is only for n divisible by 7, which contradicts the original problem's \"for every integer n\". That's confusing. Maybe there was a mistake in the example.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the user is asking why maximal ideals are prime. The problem is set in a commutative ring with 1, and A is a maximal ideal. The user's approach involves taking elements a, b such that ab is in A and showing that a or b is in A, which is the definition of a prime ideal. So the problem is to show that in a commutative ring with 1, a maximal ideal is prime. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is a commutative ring.\n- R has a multiplicative identity element (1).\n- A is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is a prime ideal.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to include the elements a and b as part of the assumptions, but that's part of the proof setup. The definition of prime ideal is that if ab ∈ A, then a ∈ A or b ∈ A for all a, b ∈ R. So the problem is to show that given A is maximal, then for any a, b in R with ab ∈ A, it must be that a ∈ A or b ∈ A. Therefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n- R is a commutative ring with 1.\n- A is a maximal ideal of R.\n- a and b are elements of R.\n- The product ab is an element of A.\n\nProblem: Prove that either a ∈ A or b ∈ A.\n\nBut this seems to mix the general proof (for all a, b) with specific elements. However, the way the user phrased their approach is that given a, b such that ab ∈ A, they want to construct an ideal containing A properly or use the fact that R/A is a field. Since R/A being a field implies that R/A is an integral domain (since fields are integral domains), but wait, no: fields are integral domains, but the converse isn't true. Wait, no. Wait, if R/A is a field, then it's a field, which is a stronger condition than being an integral domain. The user mentions they realized that R/A is a field because A is maximal, so they can use that to conclude R/A is a field, hence an integral domain, hence A is prime. Because in a field, there are no zero divisors, so if (a + A)(b + A) = 0 + A, then either a + A = 0 + A or b + A = 0 + A, meaning a ∈ A or b ∈ A. So that's the argument.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be approached by noting that R/A is a field, hence an integral domain, so A is prime. But the user's initial approach didn't recall that theorem and tried to construct an ideal. But regardless, the problem is to show that a maximal ideal A in a commutative ring R with 1 is prime.\n\nSo, in terms of the format, the assumptions would be the ring properties and A being maximal. The problem is to prove A is prime. Alternatively, if following the user's approach where they take elements a, b with ab ∈ A and need to show a or b is in A, then the problem is phrased in terms of those elements. However, the general problem is to show A is prime, which involves all such a and b.\n\nGiven the example provided by the user, even though it might have been incorrect, the key is to follow their structure. In their example, they included assumptions about the variable n (being an integer and divisible by 7), even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So maybe they included both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific condition (n divisible by 7), but in reality, the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7. That suggests maybe the example is flawed, but we have to proceed as per their instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is general: \"why are maximal ideals prime?\" with the context of a commutative ring with 1. So the assumptions should list the properties of R and A. The problem is to prove A is prime. Alternatively, if we follow the user's specific approach where they consider a, b with ab ∈ A and try to show a or b ∈ A, then the assumptions would include those elements. But since the problem is to prove the general statement, it's better to structure it as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R is a commutative ring.\n- R has a multiplicative identity 1.\n- A is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nProblem: Prove that A is a prime ideal.\n\nAlternatively, if we need to include the elements a and b, then:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R is a commutative ring with 1.\n- A is a maximal ideal of R.\n- a and b are elements of R.\n- The product ab is in A.\n\nProblem: Prove that either a is in A or b is in A.\n\nBut which is more appropriate? The original question is \"Why are maximal ideals prime?\" which is a general statement. So the problem should be to prove that maximal ideals are prime, given the ring is commutative with 1. However, in the example, the problem was structured with specific elements (n) and conditions. Hmm. But in that example, the original problem was about proving a divisibility condition for every integer n, and the formatted problem included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless there was a misunderstanding. But perhaps the user intended to have the problem's assumptions include all conditions, even if they are universally quantified.\n\nBut in the current case, since the problem is a general statement about maximal ideals being prime, the assumptions are about the ring and the ideal, and the problem is to prove the ideal is prime. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\nR has a multiplicative identity 1,\nA is a maximal ideal of R.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A is a prime ideal.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's approach with elements a and b is considered part of the problem statement, then the problem would be phrased as proving that if ab ∈ A, then a ∈ A or b ∈ A, given that A is maximal. But the problem's title is \"Why are maximal ideals prime?\" which is equivalent to proving A is prime. Therefore, the correct formatting is to list the ring and ideal properties as assumptions and the problem as proving A is prime.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided by the user, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which seems to add an extra condition not present in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user wants to include all conditions mentioned in the problem, even if they are part of the universal quantifier. But that would be incorrect. However, since the example is given, I have to follow it even if it's flawed.\n\nBut in the current case, the original problem (the user's question) is \"Why are maximal ideals prime?\" with the setup in a commutative ring with 1, and A a maximal ideal. The user is trying to prove that if ab ∈ A, then a ∈ A or b ∈ A. So perhaps the problem should be structured with the assumptions including the elements a and b and their product, as part of the problem's conditions. Wait, but in the definition of a prime ideal, it's \"for all a, b in R, if ab ∈ A, then a ∈ A or b ∈ A\". So to prove A is prime, you have to show this for all a, b. Therefore, the problem is to show that under the assumptions that R is commutative with 1 and A is maximal, then for any a, b in R with ab ∈ A, it follows that a ∈ A or b ∈ A.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would include:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\nR has a multiplicative identity 1,\nA is a maximal ideal of R,\na and b are elements of R,\nab is an element of A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that either a is in A or b is in A.\n\nBut wait, the original question is \"Prove that A is a prime ideal\", which is equivalent to the for all statement. But the user's specific approach is taking arbitrary a, b with ab ∈ A and showing a or b ∈ A. So perhaps structuring the problem as the latter would align with the user's thought process. However, the example given by the user seems to have transformed the original problem's universal statement into a specific instance with assumptions on n. That might be incorrect, but given that example, perhaps we should follow suit.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91,\" which is a universal statement. However, the formatted problem's assumptions include \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". This suggests that the user might have intended to include the universal condition as an assumption, but added an extra condition (divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. But if we follow that pattern, perhaps for the current problem, we need to include the universal conditions as assumptions. But that's not standard. Typically, assumptions are the given conditions, not the universally quantified variables.\n\nBut given the user's example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem was for all integers n. So perhaps the user is treating the variable in the problem (n) as part of the assumptions, even if it's universally quantified. In the current problem, the variables are a and b, so following that pattern, the assumptions would include a and b being elements of R with ab in A. Then the problem is to prove a or b is in A.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\nR has a multiplicative identity 1,\nA is a maximal ideal of R,\na and b are elements of R,\nab is an element of A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that either a is in A or b is in A.\n\nThis aligns with the user's example where variables (n) and their conditions are listed as assumptions, even if they are part of the universal statement. Therefore, despite the potential confusion, this seems to be the way the user wants it formatted.",
