    "Content": "I've been given the question of showing that no group of order $400$ is simple. I've tried to attack it via the Sylow theorems for about a week now, but all the tricks and methods I know seem to be failing horribly. Things I've tried: Trying to produce a contradiction by giving a map into $S_n$ by elements acting by conjugation on Sylow 5-subgroups doesn't work, since there are 16 such Sylow 5-subgroups, and 400 divides $16!$, so it might very well be an injection and therefore we can't obviously find a nontrivial kernel. Trying element counting is messy and I can't get it to come out the way I want- for instance, we can show that each of the Sylow 5-subgroups is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_5\\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$, so there should be at least 125 elements of order divisible by only 5, but I can't see this producing a contradiction with any of the  things I can find out about Sylow 2-subgroups. Anyways, I'm probably missing something fairly obvious, and I would appreciate any hints, solutions, or other help that you could give.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an outline for a solution. First of all, $|G| = 400 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2\\ $. By Sylow's theorem we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must be a divisor of $2^4$ and that it is $1$ modulo $5$. Thus it is either $1$ or $2^4$. If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal. For the other case, suppose first that the intersections of different Sylow 5-subgroups are always trivial. By counting elements you can conclude that $G$ has exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, which is then normal. If we have Sylow 5-subgroups $P$ and $Q$ such that $P \\cap Q \\neq \\{1\\}$, then $|P \\cap Q| = 5$. Therefore $P \\cap Q$ is normal in $P$ and $Q$, and thus is normal in the subgroup $\\langle P, Q \\rangle$ generated by $P$ and $Q$. Finally, show that either $\\langle P, Q \\rangle$ is normal in $G$ or equals $G$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem: \"No group of order 400 is simple.\" I need to structure this according to the given format. First, I'll identify all the assumptions from the original question.\n\nThe user mentions that the group has order 400, so that's one assumption. They also talk about Sylow 5-subgroups, specifically that there are 16 of them, each isomorphic to Z5 x Z5. The user tried element counting, noting there are at least 125 elements of order 5. The problem is to prove the group isn't simple, meaning it has a nontrivial normal subgroup.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"no group of order 400 is simple,\" so the assumptions are about the group's order and properties related to Sylow subgroups. The user's attempt mentions Sylow 5-subgroups being 16 in number and each isomorphic to Z5 x Z5. However, are these given facts or conclusions from Sylow theorems?\n\nIn Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow p-subgroups, n_p, satisfies n_p ≡ 1 mod p and divides the group order divided by p^k. For order 400 = 16*25 = 16*5^2. So for Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5 ≡ 1 mod 5 and divides 16. The possible n_5 could be 1 or 16. Since the group is supposed to be simple, n_5 can't be 1 (otherwise the Sylow 5-subgroup would be normal). So n_5 must be 16. The user states each Sylow 5-subgroup is isomorphic to Z5 x Z5, which makes sense because a group of order 25 is abelian and either cyclic (Z25) or elementary abelian (Z5 x Z5). Since 25 is 5^2, if the exponent is 5, it's Z5 x Z5. But does the problem assume that or is that derived?\n\nWait, the original problem doesn't state that; the user in their attempt mentions that they can show each Sylow 5-subgroup is isomorphic to Z5 x Z5. So perhaps that's part of their reasoning, not an assumption. The actual problem statement is just \"no group of order 400 is simple.\" Therefore, the only explicit assumption is the group order is 400. The rest are part of the user's attempts.\n\nBut in the example given earlier, the assumption included the divisibility by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe that was a mistake? Let me check the example again.\n\nThe example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that contradicts because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. So perhaps the example was incorrect? Wait, maybe there was a misinterpretation. Wait, 91 is 7*13. So maybe the problem intended that when n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't specify that. Hmm, perhaps the example had a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem is \"No group of order 400 is simple,\" so the main assumption is the group has order 400. The user's question includes their attempts, such as Sylow 5-subgroups being 16, each isomorphic to Z5xZ5, but those are part of their reasoning, not assumptions given by the problem. Therefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should only include the given conditions, not the derived ones.\n\nSo for this problem:\n\nAssumption: The group has order 400.\n\nProblem: Prove that the group is not simple.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is \"No group of order 400 is simple,\" so the problem is to prove that any group of order 400 is not simple. Therefore, the only assumption is the group's order is 400. The other details in the user's question are their attempts, like Sylow subgroups counts and structure, but those aren't part of the problem's assumptions. They are part of the solution approach.\n\nHence, following the example, even though in the example they might have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), but in reality, the original problem was for every integer n. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But given the user's instruction, maybe we need to extract all assumptions from the original problem, which in this case is just the group's order. The rest are part of the user's reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: The group has order 400.\n\nProblem: Prove that the group is not simple.\n\nBut wait, the example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow it. However, in this case, the problem as stated is to show no group of order 400 is simple, so the only assumption is the group's order. Therefore, following the example's structure, but if the example added an extra assumption, maybe in this case, we need to list more?\n\nWait, looking back at the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps there was a mistake. Maybe the original problem had a typo or the user misformatted. Anyway, following the user's instruction, we have to list the assumptions as per the problem. But in the case of the group of order 400, the problem is to show that any such group is not simple. Therefore, the only assumption is the group's order. The Sylow 5-subgroups details are part of the user's approach, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The group has order 400.\n\nProblem: Prove that the group is not simple.\n\nBut perhaps the problem requires more assumptions, like properties of Sylow subgroups? Wait, no, the problem is stated as is. The user's question includes their attempts and thoughts, but the actual problem is just \"no group of order 400 is simple\", which only assumes the group's order. Therefore, the assumptions should be only that. However, in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, but that might have been an error. So perhaps the correct approach here is to list only the given assumptions from the problem, not the solution attempts.\n\nHence, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption: The group has order 400.\n\nProblem: Prove that the group is not simple.\n\nBut let me check the user's example again. In their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem intended that n must be divisible by 7? Or perhaps the original problem had a mistake. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the formatted assumption shouldn't add \"n is divisible by 7\". Therefore, the example might be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user wants us to extract the key assumptions from the problem statement, even if they are implicit. For the group problem, the key assumption is the group's order. Therefore, the formatted problem should list only that.",
