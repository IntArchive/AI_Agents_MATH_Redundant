    "Content": "We can say that a bounded function $f$ on a bounded interval $[a,b]$ is Riemann integrable if $$\\sup \\{\\int_a^b\\phi : \\phi \\le f, \\phi \\text{    step function} \\} = \\inf \\{\\int_a^b\\phi dx : \\phi \\ge f, \\phi \\text{    step function} \\}$$ In the same way, I have seen the definition of Lebesgue integral as $$\\sup \\{\\int_a^b\\phi : \\phi \\le f, \\phi \\text{    simple function} \\} = \\inf \\{\\int_a^b\\phi : \\phi \\ge f, \\phi \\text{    simple function} \\}$$ and the Lebesgue integral $\\int_{[a,b]}f$ equals the lower Lebesgue integral on the left and the upper Lebesgue integral on the right. SO we can prove that if the bounded function is Riemann integrable then it is also Lebesgue integral because every step function is also a simple function and $$\\inf \\{\\int_a^b\\phi : \\phi \\le f, \\phi \\text{    step function} \\} \\le \\inf \\{\\int_a^b\\phi : \\phi \\ge f, \\phi \\text{    simple function} \\} \\\\ \\le \\sup \\{\\int_a^b\\phi : \\phi \\ge f, \\phi \\text{    simple function} \\} \\\\ \\le \\sup \\{\\int_a^b\\phi : \\phi \\ge f, \\phi \\text{    step function} \\} $$ Yet in  many places  the theorem is proved by showing if $f$ is Riemann integrable then (1) there is an increasing sequence $\\phi_n$ of simple functions bounded above by $f$ which converges; (2) the sequence converges almost everywhere to $f$; and (3) in this case $f$ must be measurable and Lebesgue integrable. The second proof of (1), (2) and (3) is pretty complicated, yet the first proof seems so easy. Am I missing something here? Is the first proof skipping some important step?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your proof is valid for a bounded function defined on the closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$ , despite the apparent simplicity.  It also relies on the fact that the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are the same for step functions, as mentioned by Tony Piccolo. The other proof you mention is also valid but takes you on a more roundabout path because it strings together a number of results, each of which is not altogether trivial to prove. A bounded, measurable function defined on a set of finite\nmeasure is Lebesgue integrable. If a sequence of measurable functions converges almost everywhere\nto $f$ , then the limit function $f$ is measurable. If $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ , then there exists a\nsequence of simple (measurable) functions converging almost everywhere\nto $f$ . Adding even more complexity, the proof of the third statement that I know also uses the fact that the set of discontinuities of a Riemann integrable function must be of measure zero. It begins by constructing a partition of $[a,b]$ with dyadic intervals: $$I_{n,k} = \\begin{cases}[a + (b-a)\\frac{k-1}{2^n}, a + (b-a)\\frac{k}{2^n})\\,\\,\\, k = 1 , \\ldots, 2^n -1 \\\\ [a + (b-a)\\frac{2^n-1}{2^n}, b] \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, k = 2^n\\end{cases} $$ With $m_k  = \\inf_{I_{n,k}}f(x)$ , we can construct the sequence of simple functions $$\\phi_n(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{2^n} m_k \\, \\chi_{I_{n,k}}(x)$$ The sequence is increasing and, since $f$ is bounded, by monotonicity is convergent to some function $\\phi$ such that $\\phi_n(x) \\uparrow \\phi(x) \\leqslant f(x).$ If $x \\in I_{n,k}$ then the oscillation of $f$ over that interval satisfies $$\\sup_{u,v \\in I_{n,k}}|f(u) - f(v)| \\geqslant f(x) - \\phi_n(x) \\geqslant f(x) - \\phi(x).$$ Thus, $f(x) \\neq \\phi(x)$ only at points where $f$ is not continuous, which must belong to a measure zero set if $f$ is Riemann integrable. Therefore, $f$ is almost everywhere the limit of a sequence of simple functions and is measurable. I would agree that the second approach is \"pretty complicated\".  However, I think it is not uncommon to find theorems with a variety of proofs ranging in complexity.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about proving that a Riemann integrable function on a bounded interval [a, b] is also Lebesgue integrable, and they're comparing two different approaches to the proof. The first approach uses the relationship between step functions and simple functions in the definitions of the integrals, while the second approach involves constructing sequences of simple functions converging to f and proving measurability. They're confused because the first method seems straightforward, but they've encountered more complicated proofs elsewhere. So, the task is to structure their question into the Assumption and Problem format as per the examples.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions from the original question. Let's read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe user mentions that a bounded function f on [a, b] is Riemann integrable if the sup of the lower step function integrals equals the inf of the upper step function integrals. Then, they define the Lebesgue integral similarly but with simple functions. They argue that since every step function is a simple function, the lower Riemann integral (sup over step functions below f) should be less than or equal to the lower Lebesgue integral (sup over simple functions below f), and similarly the upper Riemann integral (inf over step functions above f) should be greater than or equal to the upper Lebesgue integral. Therefore, if the Riemann upper and lower integrals are equal, the Lebesgue upper and lower integrals must also be equal, implying Lebesgue integrability. However, they note that other proofs use a different method involving sequences of simple functions converging a.e. to f and proving measurability, which is more involved. The question is whether the first approach is missing something.\n\nAssumptions here need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Let's parse the original problem:\n\n1. The function f is bounded on [a, b].\n2. The interval [a, b] is bounded.\n3. f is Riemann integrable on [a, b], meaning the supremum of lower step function integrals equals the infimum of upper step function integrals.\n4. The Lebesgue integral is defined as the supremum of lower simple function integrals equals the infimum of upper simple function integrals.\n5. Every step function is a simple function.\n6. The user's first proof compares the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals via these inclusions of function classes, leading to the conclusion that the Lebesgue integral exists and equals the Riemann integral.\n\nThe problem, as posed by the user, is whether their first proof is valid or if it's skipping important steps, given that other proofs use more complicated methods involving measurability and convergence.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions would include:\n- f is a bounded function on [a, b].\n- [a, b] is a bounded interval.\n- f is Riemann integrable on [a, b].\n- The Lebesgue integral is defined using supremum and infimum over simple functions.\n- Every step function is a simple function.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't to prove that f is Lebesgue integrable given these, but to question why the simple comparison of integrals via step vs. simple functions isn't sufficient, when compared to the more complicated proof involving measurability and convergence. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nThe user's assumptions leading to their first proof are:\n\n- f is bounded on [a, b].\n- f is Riemann integrable on [a, b].\n- Every step function is a simple function.\n- The supremum of lower Riemann integrals ≤ supremum of lower Lebesgue integrals.\n- The infimum of upper Lebesgue integrals ≤ infimum of upper Riemann integrals.\n- Since Riemann upper and lower integrals are equal, the Lebesgue upper and lower integrals must also be equal, hence f is Lebesgue integrable.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to identify if there's a flaw in this reasoning, i.e., the user is questioning whether their first proof is correct. The problem statement would be their question: Is the first proof correct, or is it skipping important steps, such as proving measurability?\n\nBut according to the format, we need to present the problem as \"Prove that ...\" or a question. However, the user's question is more of a verification of their proof approach versus another method. But in the example given, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that...\", but here the user is asking whether their proof is missing something. However, according to the initial instructions, the task is to structure the problem as Assumptions and Problem. The user's problem is not a \"Prove that\" but a \"Is the first proof skipping some important step?\" So perhaps the problem is phrased as a question.\n\nBut looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove something, and the formatted problem restated that. Here, the original question is asking whether their first proof is valid or missing steps. However, the user might want to structure the problem as per their actual question. But the example provided by the user shows that even when the original problem is a question, it's rephrased into a \"Prove that...\" statement. Wait, the original example was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the user's question here is more of a \"Is this proof correct?\" So maybe the task is to convert the user's question into a problem statement in the format, perhaps extracting the key mathematical problem.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem kept that as the problem statement. The user here is asking whether their first proof is missing steps. So perhaps the formatted problem should be their core question: \"Is the first proof valid, or does it skip important steps?\" But the example uses \"Prove that...\" So maybe the problem should be phrased as \"Determine whether the first proof is valid or skips important steps.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to \"Prove that a bounded Riemann integrable function on [a, b] is Lebesgue integrable,\" but the user's specific question is about the validity of the first approach. However, the user's main problem is their uncertainty about the correctness of the first proof. But according to the example, the problem is stated as the original problem's main task. The user's original problem is their question about the two different proofs. But according to the user's example, the \"Problem\" part is the mathematical statement to prove. So perhaps here, the problem is to \"Prove that if a bounded function on [a, b] is Riemann integrable, then it is Lebesgue integrable,\" but the user is questioning the validity of a particular approach to this proof. However, the user's actual question is whether the first proof is sufficient or missing steps. But how to fit that into the given format? The example seems to take the original problem's main claim and structure that as the problem, with assumptions. But here, the original question is more of a \"Is my proof correct?\" So perhaps the problem is the user's question, which is \"Is the first proof of the statement that a Riemann integrable function is Lebesgue integrable skipping some important step?\"\n\nBut according to the instructions, the problem should be structured as in the example. In the example, the original problem was to prove something, and the formatted problem restates that as the problem with assumptions. Here, the user is asking a question about the validity of a proof approach. However, perhaps the problem statement should be the mathematical assertion that needs proving, and the user's question is about the method. So maybe the problem is \"Prove that if a bounded function on [a,b] is Riemann integrable, then it is Lebesgue integrable,\" and the assumptions include the conditions given (bounded function, Riemann integrable, etc.), and the user is questioning the approach.\n\nAlternatively, given the example, maybe the user wants to extract the mathematical problem being discussed. The user is discussing the theorem that Riemann integrable implies Lebesgue integrable, so the problem is \"Prove that a bounded Riemann integrable function on [a,b] is Lebesgue integrable,\" and the assumptions would include that f is bounded, on [a,b], and Riemann integrable. Then, the user's actual question is about the two different approaches to proving this theorem, but according to the format, the problem is the mathematical statement to prove. However, in the example, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem restated that with assumptions. Similarly, here, the problem is to prove that Riemann implies Lebesgue integrable, so the formatted problem would be that. The user's actual question is about the two methods, but perhaps in this structure, the problem is the theorem itself, and the user's question is part of the context. However, the user's own problem is their question about the two proofs, which is more of a meta-question about the proof methods. But given the example, perhaps the problem is the mathematical statement, and the user's question is part of the original problem's context, but in the formatted problem, we need to extract the mathematical problem only. Therefore, the problem here is to prove that Riemann integrable implies Lebesgue integrable under the given assumptions. Then, the assumptions would include f is bounded on [a,b], f is Riemann integrable, etc. However, the user's confusion is about the two different proofs. But the example's formatted problem was the mathematical statement, so maybe that's the case here.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a bounded function on [a, b].\n- [a, b] is a bounded interval.\n- f is Riemann integrable on [a, b].\n- The Lebesgue integral is defined as the equality of the upper and lower Lebesgue integrals via simple functions.\n- Every step function is a simple function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that if a bounded function f on [a, b] is Riemann integrable, then it is Lebesgue integrable.\n\nBut the user's actual question is about the validity of their first proof approach compared to the second. However, according to the example, the formatted problem should present the mathematical problem to solve, not the meta-question about proof methods. Therefore, maybe the problem is the theorem statement, and the user's actual question is part of the context but not part of the formatted problem. Hence, the formatted problem would have the assumptions as the conditions of the theorem, and the problem as the conclusion to prove.\n\nBut let's check the original example again. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and in the formatted problem, the assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption, but the formatted problem added that. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. That seems incorrect. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems like a mistake because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts the problem. However, the original problem didn't have that assumption. Perhaps the example was incorrect? Or maybe the user intended to filter out some information. Wait, the example might be from the user's own previous work, and maybe they made an error there. But in any case, following the instructions, perhaps the task is to extract the key assumptions from the problem as presented, even if they are not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, perhaps the problem requires that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. However, this seems confusing. Maybe the example is incorrect, but we need to follow the user's instructions regardless.\n\nBack to the current problem. The original question on Math Stack Exchange is: \"Riemann Integrable implies Lebesgue Integrable\". The user is discussing two approaches to prove this theorem. The first approach compares step functions and simple functions, arguing that since step functions are simple functions, the Riemann integrability (equality of upper and lower integrals via step functions) implies Lebesgue integrability (equality via simple functions). The user's question is whether this first approach is missing something, given that another approach involving measurability is more complicated.\n\nBut to fit into the format, the assumptions and problem need to be structured. The mathematical theorem to prove is: If a bounded function f on [a, b] is Riemann integrable, then it is Lebesgue integrable. The assumptions for this theorem would be:\n\n- f is a bounded function.\n- The domain of f is a bounded interval [a, b].\n- f is Riemann integrable on [a, b].\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a bounded function,\nf is defined on a bounded interval [a, b],\nf is Riemann integrable on [a, b].\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is Lebesgue integrable on [a, b].\n\nHowever, the user's specific question is about the validity of a particular proof approach, not the theorem itself. But according to the example, even if the original problem has additional context or questions, the formatted problem extracts the mathematical problem to solve. The example had the original problem's main claim as the problem, with added assumptions. However, in the user's example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. This seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended to show filtering out unrelated information, even if it changes the problem. Wait, the original example's problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That changes the problem from \"for all n\" to \"for n divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to restructure the problem with necessary assumptions, even if they're implicit. But in the example, maybe the actual problem needed n to be divisible by 7 to have A(n) divisible by 91 (since 91=13*7), so perhaps the original problem's answer requires that n is divisible by both 7 and 13, but the user structured it with n divisible by 7. However, I'm not sure. This might be a mistake in the example, but regardless, we have to follow the user's instructions.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user's question is about whether the first proof approach is valid. But according to the format, we need to present the problem as a mathematical statement to prove, with assumptions. The user's problem is about the validity of a proof method, but perhaps the formatted problem should still be the theorem itself. However, the user's actual question is whether the first proof is correct, so maybe the problem is to \"Determine if the first proof is valid,\" but that's more of a meta-question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is the theorem, and the assumptions include the specific conditions under which the first proof operates.\n\nBut given the example, even if the original problem is a question about a proof method, the formatted problem is the mathematical assertion. So here, the problem is to \"Prove that a bounded Riemann integrable function on [a,b] is Lebesgue integrable,\" with assumptions being the conditions of the theorem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a bounded function,\nf is defined on the bounded interval [a, b],\nf is Riemann integrable on [a, b].\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is Lebesgue integrable on [a, b].\n\nBut the user's actual question is about the two different proofs. However, according to the example, the formatted problem focuses on the mathematical statement, not the proof methods. Hence, the user's discussion about the two proofs is context, but the formatted problem is the theorem itself. Therefore, the answer should structure it as such.",
