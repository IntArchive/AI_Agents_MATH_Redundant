    "Content": "I have for some time been trawling through the Internet looking for an aesthetic proof of Taylor's theorem. By which I mean this: there are plenty of proofs that introduce some arbitrary construct: no mention is given of from whence this beast came.  and you can logically hack away line by line until the thing is solved. but this kind of proof is ugly.  a beautiful proof should rise naturally from the ground. I've seen one proof claiming to do it from the fundamental theorem of calculus. It looked messy. I've seen several attempts to use integration by parts repeatedly. But surely it would be tidier to do this without bringing in  all of that extra machinery. The nicest two approaches seem to involve using the mean value theorem and Rolle's theorem.  but I can't find a lucid presentation of either approach. Maybe my brain is unusually stupid, and the approaches on Wikipedia etc are perfectly good enough for everyone else. Does anyone have a crystal clear understanding of this phenomenon? Or a web-link to such an understanding? *EDIT*: Eventually a Cambridge mathematician explained it to me in a way that I could understand, and I have written up the proof here . To my mind it is the most instructional proof I have encountered, yet putting it as an answer received mostly downvotes. It seems strange to me that no one else seems to concur.  But it should be up to the keenest mathematical minds to choose which answer should be accepted. It shouldn't be up to me. Therefore I will bow to the wisdom of the community, and accept the currently most-upvoted answer. I have learned from Machine Learning that a \"Committee of Experts\" outperforms any one expert, and I am certainly no expert.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an approach that seems rather natural,\nbased on applying the fundamental theorem\nof calculus successively to $f(x)$, $f'(t_1)$, $f''(t_2)$, etc.:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&& f(x)=f(a)+\\int_a^x f'(t_1)\\,dt_1\n\\\\&&\n= f(a)+ \\int_a^x f'(a)\\,dt_1 + \\int_a^x \\!\\! \\int_a^{t_1} f''(t_2)\\,dt_2\\,dt_1\n\\\\&&\n= f(a)+ \\int_a^x f'(a)\\,dt_1 + \n\\int_a^x \\!\\! \\int_a^{t_1}\n f''(a)\n \\,dt_2\\,dt_1\n+\\int_a^x \n\\!\\! \\int_a^{t_1}\n\\!\\! \\int_a^{t_2}\nf'''(t_3)\n\\,dt_3\\,dt_2\\,dt_1\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nNotice that\n$$\n\\int_a^x f'(a)\\,dt_1=f'(a)\\int_a^x dt_1=f'(a)(x-a),\n$$$$\n\\int_a^x \\!\\! \\int_a^{t_1}\n f''(a)\\,dt_2\\,dt_1\n = f''(a)\\int_a^x (t_1-a)\\,dt_1 = f''(a)\\frac{(x-a)^2}{2},\n $$$$\n \\int_a^x \n\\!\\! \\int_a^{t_1}\n\\!\\! \\int_a^{t_2}\nf'''(a)\\,dt_3\\,dt_2\\,dt_1\n= f'''(a)\\int_a^x \\frac{(t_1-a)^2}{2}\\,dt_1 = f'''(a)\\frac{(x-a)^3}{3!},\n$$\nand in general\n$$\n \\int_a^x \n\\!\\! \\int_a^{t_1}\n\\!\\ldots \\int_a^{t_{n-1}}\nf^{(n)}(a)\\,dt_n\\ldots\\,dt_2\\,dt_1\n= f^{(n)}(a)\\frac{(x-a)^{n}}{n!}.\n$$ By induction, then, one proves\n$$\nf(x) = P_n(x)+ R_n(x)\n$$\nwhere $P_n$ is the Taylor polynomial\n$$\nP_n(x) = f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+f''(a)\\frac{(x-a)^2}{2}+\\ldots+ f^{(n)}(a) \\frac{(x-a)^n}{n!},\n$$\nand the remainder $R_n(x)$ is represented by nested integrals as\n$$R_n (x) = \n \\int_a^x \n\\!\\! \\int_a^{t_1}\n\\!\\ldots \\int_a^{t_{n}}\nf^{(n+1)}(t_{n+1})\n\\,dt_{n+1}\\ldots\\,dt_2\\,dt_1.\n$$ We can establish the Lagrange form of the remainder by applying the intermediate \nand extreme value\ntheorems, using simple comparisons as follows.  Consider the case $x>a$ first. \nLet $m$ be the minimum value of $f^{(n+1)}$ on $[a,x]$, and $M$ the maximum value. \nThen since \n$$ m\\le f^{(n+1)}(t_{n+1}) \\le M\n$$\nfor all $t_{n+1}$ in $[a,x]$, after $n+1$ repeated integrations one finds\n$$\nm \\frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \n\\le R_n(x) \\le\nM \\frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}.\n$$\nBut now, notice that the function \n$$\nt\\mapsto f^{(n+1)}(t) \\frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \n$$\nattains the extreme values \n$$\nm \\frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \n\\quad\\mbox{and} \\quad \nM \\frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\n$$\nat some points in $[a,x]$. By the intermediate value theorem, there must be\nsome point $t$ between these two points (so $t\\in[a,x]$) such that\n$$\nR_n(x) = f^{(n+1)}(t) \\frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}.\n$$\nThis is the Lagrange form of the remainder. \nIf $x<a$ and $n$ is odd, the same proof works. If $x<a$ and $n$ is even,\n$(x-a)^{n+1}<0$ and the same proof works after reversing some inequalities. One can motivate this whole approach in a couple of different ways.\nE.g., one can argue that \n$\n{(x-a)^n}/{n!}\n$\nbecomes small for large $n$, so the remainders $R_n(x)$ will become small\nif the derivatives of $f$ stay bounded, say. Or, one can reason loosely as follows: $f(x)\\approx f(a)$ for $x$ near $a$.\nAsk, what is the remainder exactly? Apply the fundamental theorem as above, then \napproximate the first remainder using the approximation $f'(t_1)\\approx f'(a)$. \nRepeating, one produces the Taylor polynomials by the pattern of the argument above.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the key elements: the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem is then clearly stated.\n\nThe original question here is about finding the simplest proof of Taylor's theorem. The user mentions various attempts like using the fundamental theorem of calculus, integration by parts, mean value theorem, and Rolle's theorem. They're looking for a clear, aesthetic proof that arises naturally without extra machinery. However, the question doesn't present a traditional math problem with equations to solve. Instead, it's more of a request for understanding a proof approach.\n\nBut according to the task, I need to extract assumptions and the problem. Since the question is about proving Taylor's theorem, the assumptions would relate to the conditions required for Taylor's theorem to hold. Taylor's theorem typically requires the function to be differentiable several times, so the assumptions would include that the function is n-times differentiable, perhaps continuity of derivatives, and an interval around a point. \n\nThe problem statement would then be to prove Taylor's theorem under those assumptions. However, the original question is more about the proof's simplicity rather than the theorem's statement. But following the example, which took the original problem and structured it, perhaps here the problem is \"Prove Taylor's theorem in the simplest way possible using an aesthetic approach that arises naturally, preferably without introducing arbitrary constructs or extra machinery like integration by parts.\"\n\nWait, but the example given had specific mathematical expressions. Here, the user is asking for a proof method, not a numerical problem. So maybe the assumptions are the standard conditions for Taylor's theorem, and the problem is to provide a simple proof using methods like mean value theorem or Rolle's theorem. But the original question doesn't state the theorem; it's assumed. So perhaps the problem is \"Prove Taylor's theorem using a simple and aesthetic approach, preferably using the mean value theorem or Rolle's theorem without introducing arbitrary constructs or extra machinery.\"\n\nBut the example had specific assumptions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions for Taylor's theorem would be that the function is sufficiently smooth (n times differentiable), perhaps on an interval containing a point a, etc. Each assumption needs to be listed line by line. So let's list the standard assumptions for Taylor's theorem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Let \\( f \\) be a function that is \\( n \\)-times differentiable on an interval containing a point \\( a \\).\n- The \\( (n+1) \\)-th derivative of \\( f \\) exists on the interval.\n\nBut wait, the original question doesn't specify these; the user is asking about the proof. So maybe the problem is simply \"Prove Taylor's theorem in the simplest way possible,\" with the assumptions being the standard ones required for the theorem. However, the user's original problem didn't state the theorem explicitly, so structuring it properly might require inferring the necessary conditions. Since the example included assumptions that were in the original problem (like n being an integer and divisible by 7), but here the original problem doesn't list those, perhaps the assumptions are implicit in Taylor's theorem. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the standard assumptions of Taylor's theorem and then state the problem as proving it.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( f \\) is a real-valued function defined on an interval containing a point \\( a \\),\n- \\( f \\) is \\( n \\)-times differentiable on the interval,\n- The \\( (n+1) \\)-th derivative of \\( f \\) exists on the interval.\n\nProblem:\nProve Taylor's theorem using a simple and aesthetic approach, preferably without introducing arbitrary constructs or extra machinery like integration by parts, and instead using methods like the mean value theorem or Rolle's theorem.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as looking for the simplest proof, not as a problem to prove it. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the format. The example took the original problem's content and structured the assumptions and problem. Here, the original problem is a request for a proof method, so translating that into a problem statement that asks to prove Taylor's theorem under certain conditions with a specific method. Alternatively, if the user is asking for the proof, but the task is to structure it as a problem to be solved, then the problem is to \"Prove Taylor's theorem...\" with the standard assumptions.\n\nI think that's the way to go. The user's original question is about finding the simplest proof, so structuring it as a problem to prove Taylor's theorem with the standard assumptions and the condition that the proof should be simple/aesthetic using specified methods.",
