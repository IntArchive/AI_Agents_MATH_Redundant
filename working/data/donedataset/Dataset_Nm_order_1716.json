    "AcceptedAnswer": "Given a function $f(z)$, we say that $f$ has a singularity (of a given type) at infinity if and only if $f(\\frac1z)$ has a singularity (of said type) at $0$. By Liouville's Theorem, we know that every bounded entire function is constant. Conversely, it's clear that every constant function (with a non-infinite constant) is bounded and entire. Suppose $f$ is a non-constant entire function, so that $$f(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_nz^n,$$ where the radius of convergence of this power series is infinite, and there is at least one $n\\geq 1$ such that $a_n\\neq0$. Since $$f\\left(\\frac1z\\right)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{a_n}{z^n}=a_0+\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{a_n}{z^n},$$ and since $a_n\\neq 0$ for some $n>0$, then $f$ has a singularity at infinity--that is, the Laurent expansion of $f(\\frac1z)$ about $z=0$ has a non-zero singular part. If there are only finitely-many non-zero $a_n$'s, then $f$ has a pole at infinity. Otherwise, $f$ has an essential singularity at infinity.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that every non-constant entire function f: C → C has a singularity at infinity and determine what type of singularity it must be. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some complex analysis concepts. An entire function is holomorphic everywhere on the complex plane. The question is about the behavior at infinity, which relates to the concept of singularities at infinity. \n\nSingularities at infinity are a bit tricky because we usually think about singularities at finite points. To analyze the behavior at infinity, one common technique is to consider the function g(z) = f(1/z) and examine the behavior of g(z) near z=0. If g(z) has a singularity at z=0, then f(z) has a singularity at infinity.\n\nSo, let's apply that here. Since f is entire, it can be represented by its Taylor series expansion around 0, which converges everywhere in C. The function f(z) is non-constant, so its Taylor series has at least one non-zero coefficient apart from the constant term.\n\nNow, looking at g(z) = f(1/z), this function will have a singularity at z=0. The nature of this singularity depends on the original function f(z). If f(z) is a polynomial, then as z approaches infinity (which corresponds to 1/z approaching 0), f(z) behaves like its highest degree term. For a polynomial of degree n, f(z) ~ z^n as z → ∞. Then g(z) = f(1/z) ~ (1/z)^n, which means g(z) has a pole of order n at z=0. Therefore, infinity is a pole for polynomials.\n\nBut what if f(z) is a non-polynomial entire function? These are transcendental entire functions, like e^z, sin z, etc. In such cases, the Taylor series of f(z) has infinitely many terms. Then, g(z) = f(1/z) will have an essential singularity at z=0 because the Laurent series of g(z) around 0 will have infinitely many negative powers (since substituting 1/z into an infinite series of positive powers of z gives infinitely many negative powers of z). By the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem, essential singularities have dense images in any neighborhood, which would apply here. Thus, infinity would be an essential singularity for transcendental entire functions.\n\nPutting this together: If f is a non-constant entire function, then either f is a polynomial, leading to a pole at infinity, or f is transcendental, leading to an essential singularity at infinity. Therefore, every non-constant entire function must have a singularity at infinity, and the type is either a pole (if it's a polynomial) or an essential singularity (otherwise). Since the problem says \"every non-constant entire function,\" the answer must cover both cases. However, the problem also asks \"what type of singularity must this be?\" which suggests there's a unique answer. Wait, but polynomials have a pole and transcendental functions have essential. So maybe the answer is that the singularity is either a pole or essential, but in any case, it's not removable. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the singularity must be either a pole or essential, but since the function is entire and non-constant, it can't be removable. So the answer is that the singularity at infinity is either a pole (if the function is a polynomial) or an essential singularity (if it's transcendental). Therefore, the singularity exists and is non-removable.\n\nBut the original problem states \"has a singularity at infinity\" and asks \"what type of singularity must this be?\" The answer would be: If f is a polynomial, then the singularity at infinity is a pole; otherwise, it's an essential singularity. However, since polynomials and transcendental entire functions are the only possibilities for non-constant entire functions, the singularity must be either a pole or essential. Therefore, the problem is showing that infinity is a non-removable singularity for any non-constant entire function, so the answer is that the singularity must be either a pole or an essential singularity. But the exact wording might need to be precise. \n\nWait, let me check the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem. If there's an essential singularity, then the function has dense image near that point. But if it's a pole, then the function tends to infinity. For polynomials, as z approaches infinity, |f(z)| approaches infinity, so it's a pole. For transcendental entire functions, like e^z, as z approaches infinity along different paths, e^z can take all values except possibly one (by Picard's theorem), which implies an essential singularity. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that every non-constant entire function has a singularity at infinity, which is a pole if the function is a polynomial and an essential singularity otherwise. So the answer is that the singularity at infinity exists and is either a pole or an essential singularity. \n\nBut the problem is phrased as \"What type of singularity must this be?\" So maybe the answer is that it must be either a pole or essential, but not removable. Hence, the singularity must be non-removable. However, depending on whether the function is polynomial or not, the exact type is determined. Therefore, in general, the answer would be that the singularity at infinity is either a pole or an essential singularity. So in the problem statement, the user needs to show that there's a singularity (i.e., not removable) and that it's either pole or essential. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting a more specific answer. Wait, let's recall Liouville's theorem. Liouville's theorem states that bounded entire functions are constant. So if an entire function f(z) has a removable singularity at infinity, then it's bounded near infinity, hence bounded everywhere, hence constant by Liouville. Therefore, if f is non-constant, the singularity at infinity cannot be removable. Therefore, the singularity must be either a pole or essential. But in either case, the answer is that the singularity is non-removable, specifically a pole or essential. Therefore, the problem is proven by contradiction: if the singularity were removable, then f would be bounded, hence constant by Liouville, contradicting the non-constant assumption. Therefore, the singularity must be either a pole or essential. Then, depending on whether f is a polynomial or not, it's a pole or essential. So the answer to the question is: Every non-constant entire function has a non-removable singularity at infinity; specifically, it is a pole if the function is a polynomial and an essential singularity otherwise. \n\nTherefore, to structure this problem according to the given format, the assumptions are that f is a non-constant entire function from C to C. The problem is to prove that f has a singularity at infinity and determine the type. So the formatted problem would list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. Then the problem statement. \n\nBut in the original problem, the user didn't specify whether f is polynomial or not; the question is general for all non-constant entire functions. So the assumptions are just that f is entire, non-constant, and maps C to C. Then the problem is to show it has a singularity at infinity and determine the type. \n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, they had in the original problem an expression with n being an integer and then in the formatted problem, they listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the question was to prove divisibility by 91 (7×13), but the example formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be because the original problem's actual assumptions included n being any integer, but the user example restructured it. Wait, no. Let me check the example again. \n\nThe original problem in the example was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem under Assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That might be a mistake. So perhaps the user's example is flawed. But regardless, the user wants to follow the format where the Assumptions are extracted from the original problem, and perhaps the problem is restructured. Wait, but in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which was converted into \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then, where did \"n is divisible by 7\" come from? The original problem was about divisibility by 91, which is 7×13, but perhaps the user in the example made a mistake. Anyway, maybe the user's example is not to be emulated exactly but rather the structure. So for the current problem, the original question is: How to prove that every non-constant entire function f: C→C has a singularity at infinity? What type of singularity must this be? \n\nSo the assumptions here are: f is entire (holomorphic on C), f is non-constant, and f maps C to C. So each of these is a separate assumption. \n\nTherefore, in the required format:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an entire function,\nf is non-constant,\nf maps from C to C.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f has a singularity at infinity and determine what type of singularity it must be.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"f maps from C to C\" is redundant since the function is given as f: C→C. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- f: C → C is entire,\n- f is non-constant.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is an entire function,\nf is non-constant.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f has a singularity at infinity and determine what type of singularity it must be.\n\nThat seems to fit. Because each line is one property. The first is that f is entire, the second that it's non-constant. Then the problem is to prove the existence and type of the singularity at infinity.",
