    "Content": "From Pugh's analysis book, prelim problem 57 from Chapter 4: Let $f$ and $f_n$ be functions from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$. Assume that $f_n(x_n)\\to f(x)$ as $n\\to\\infty$ whenever $x_n\\to x$. Prove that $f$ is continuous. (Note: the functions $f_n$ are not assumed to be continuous.) here's my attempt: assume $x_n \\to x$. we want to show that $f(x_n) \\to f(x)$. so $|f(x_n) - f(x)| \\leq |f(x_n)-f_n(x_n)| + |f_n(x_n)-f(x)|$. The second term can be made to be less than any $\\varepsilon > 0$ for $n$ sufficiently large. i'm having trouble with the first term. can anyone help? thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ and let $\\epsilon>0$. Note that the hypotheses imply $(f_n)$ converges to $f$ pointwise. From this, choose a subsequence  $(f_{n_k})$ of $(f_n)$ such that\n$$ |f_{n_k} (x_k) -f(x_k)|<\\epsilon$$ for every $k$. Claim: $f_{n_k}(x_k)$ converges to $f(x)$. Proof of Claim: Consider the sequence $(y_n)$\n$$(y_n)=\n(\\underbrace{x_1,x_1,\\ldots,x_1}_{n_1\\text{-terms}}\\,,\\,\n\\underbrace{x_2,x_2,\\ldots,x_2}_{n_2-n_1\\text{-terms}}\\,,\\,\n\\underbrace{x_3,x_3,\\ldots,x_3}_{n_3- n_2 \\text{-terms}},\\ldots).\n$$ \nSince this sequence converges to $x$, we have $f_n(y_n)\\rightarrow f(x)$. Thus $f_{n_k}(y_{n_k})=f_{n_k}(x_k)\\rightarrow f(x)$. Now use the Claim and the inequality:\n$$\n|f(x_k)-f(x)|\n\\le |f(x_k)-f_{n_k}(x_k)|+|f_{n_k}(x_k)-f(x)|.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem thoroughly.\n\nThe problem states: Let $f$ and $f_n$ be functions from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$. Assume that $f_n(x_n)\\to f(x)$ as $n\\to\\infty$ whenever $x_n\\to x$. We need to prove that $f$ is continuous. The note mentions that the functions $f_n$ are not assumed to be continuous. \n\nThe user's attempt uses the triangle inequality: $|f(x_n) - f(x)| \\leq |f(x_n)-f_n(x_n)| + |f_n(x_n)-f(x)|$. They managed the second term but are stuck on the first. \n\nNow, to format this into the required structure. The \"Assumption\" part needs each condition applied to one object. The problem statement mentions two main conditions: \n\n1. $f_n(x_n) \\to f(x)$ whenever $x_n \\to x$. This is the key assumption. However, since the user's original problem includes \"whenever $x_n\\to x$\", this should be split into separate assumptions. Wait, but how? The original problem's assumption is that for any sequence $x_n$ converging to $x$, the sequence $f_n(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$. So perhaps each part of this condition should be listed as separate assumptions. But according to the example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object.\n\nWait, the example given had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So in this case, the main assumption is that for every sequence $x_n \\to x$, it holds that $f_n(x_n) \\to f(x)$. But how to split that into line items. Let me think.\n\nThe problem says: whenever $x_n \\to x$, then $f_n(x_n) \\to f(x)$. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- For all sequences $(x_n)$ in $\\Bbb R$, if $x_n \\to x$, then $f_n(x_n) \\to f(x)$.\n\nBut the user wants each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\n- $f_n$ and $f$ are functions from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$.\n\n- For every real number $x$ and every sequence $(x_n)$ converging to $x$, the sequence $f_n(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"whenever $x_n \\to x$\", so the convergence of $x_n$ to $x$ implies the convergence of $f_n(x_n)$ to $f(x)$. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- $f_n: \\Bbb R \\to \\Bbb R$ for all $n$.\n\n- $f: \\Bbb R \\to \\Bbb R$.\n\n- For any $x \\in \\Bbb R$ and any sequence $(x_n)$ in $\\Bbb R$ such that $x_n \\to x$, we have $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n(x_n) = f(x)$.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line. For instance, in the example, the two assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, the main assumption is the convergence condition. However, the problem states \"Assume that $f_n(x_n)\\to f(x)$ as $n\\to\\infty$ whenever $x_n\\to x$.\" So this is a single assumption. But maybe breaking down into parts? Wait, but the example didn't split the original problem's assumption into parts unless there were multiple separate conditions. In the original problem, the user had to assume n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the main assumption is the convergence condition given sequences converging. But perhaps there's another implicit assumption, like all functions are from R to R. Let's check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: Let $f$ and $f_n$ be functions from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$. So that's another assumption. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $f_n$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$ for each $n$.\n\n- $f$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$.\n\n- For every sequence $(x_n)$ in $\\Bbb R$ converging to $x$, the sequence $f_n(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$.\n\nBut in the example, the user included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nThe example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number $A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n)$ is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n\n$n$ is an integer,\n\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $A(n)$ is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but this seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should only be that n is an integer. The user in the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not part of the original problem. That might be an error. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe the original problem had additional conditions? Let me check again.\n\nNo, the original problem in the example is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption should just be that n is an integer. Unless there was a misstatement. Maybe the example is wrong. But that's the example given by the user, so I have to follow their format. \n\nSo in their example, they split the problem's conditions into two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem, there was no divisibility by 7. Wait, perhaps the example was from a different problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because proving divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13) might require that n satisfies some conditions. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumptions shouldn't include n divisible by 7. That seems like an error. \n\nBut regardless, the user provided that example, so I have to follow their structure. So perhaps in their formatting, they list all assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's premise. So for the current problem, I need to list all assumptions given in the problem.\n\nThe problem states: Let f and f_n be functions from R to R. Assume that f_n(x_n) → f(x) as n→∞ whenever x_n → x. Prove that f is continuous.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f_n: R → R for each n.\n\n2. f: R → R.\n\n3. For any sequence x_n → x, we have f_n(x_n) → f(x).\n\nBut according to the example, perhaps each assumption is split into separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$f_n$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$ for each $n$,\n\n$f$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$,\n\nFor every real number $x$ and every sequence $(x_n)$ converging to $x$, $f_n(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, the formatted problem added it. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Maybe there was a miscommunication. But given that, I should follow the user's instruction to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition to one object.\n\nIn the problem at hand, the key assumptions are:\n\n- Each $f_n$ is a function from R to R.\n\n- $f$ is a function from R to R.\n\n- For any convergent sequence $x_n \\to x$, the sequence $f_n(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$.\n\nSo each of these would be separate assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the third one is the main assumption, and the first two are given in the problem setup. But according to the example, they included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user wants to list all given conditions as assumptions. Thus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n$f_n$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$ for each $n$,\n\n$f$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$,\n\nFor every real number $x$ and every sequence $(x_n)$ in $\\Bbb R$ converging to $x$, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x_n) = f(x)$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $f$ is continuous.\n\nBut the problem's original title is \"If $f_n(x_n) \\to f(x)$ whenever $x_n \\to x$, show that $f$ is continuous\". So the main assumptions are the functions are from R to R, and the convergence condition. So these three points.\n\nBut perhaps the first two are considered part of the problem setup rather than assumptions. However, in the example, they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though it was part of the problem's statement. So following that pattern, we list all given conditions as separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants to follow that structure. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $f_n$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$ for each $n$.\n\n- $f$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$.\n\n- For every sequence $(x_n)$ in $\\Bbb R$ converging to $x$, $f_n(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$.\n\nBut perhaps the third assumption can be phrased as a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach $f_n$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$,\n\n$f$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$,\n\nFor every real number $x$ and every sequence $x_n \\to x$, $f_n(x_n) \\to f(x)$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $f$ is continuous.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. The first two lines define the domains and codomains of the functions, and the third line states the convergence condition. Then the problem is to prove continuity of $f$.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f_n$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$ for each $n$,\n$f$ is a function from $\\Bbb R$ to $\\Bbb R$,\nFor every real number $x$ and every sequence $x_n$ converging to $x$, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x_n) = f(x)$.\nProblem: Prove that $f$ is continuous.\n###",
