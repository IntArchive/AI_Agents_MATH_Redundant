    "Content": "While studying complex variables, I could learn that $f(z)=|z|^{2}$ has only one point which is $z=0$ that $f$ being differentiable and $f$ being not differentiable at any other points. Then, I was wondering if there is a function $f: \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ that has only one point differentiable and not on any other points. In intuition, it seems there are no such point!\nHowever, I have no idea how I can prove this... Additional question is that would there be any function $f: \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ that has only one point continuous and not on any other points. I think this is pretty interesting things to think about! :-)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about finding a function from the real numbers to the real numbers that is differentiable at exactly one point and nowhere else. Also, there's an additional part about continuity at only one point.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The main object here is the function f: R → R. The key conditions are differentiability at exactly one point and non-differentiability elsewhere. The user mentioned an example in complex analysis, but the problem is about real functions. The original problem doesn't specify any particular conditions on f other than its differentiability, so the assumptions should probably just state that f is a real-valued function with the differentiability condition. However, the example given in the original instruction had specific assumptions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more general. \n\nWait, the problem isn't adding any specific constraints except the differentiability at one point. So perhaps the assumption is that f is a function from R to R, and the problem is to determine if such a function exists where it's differentiable at exactly one point and nowhere else. Similarly, the additional question is about continuity at exactly one point.\n\nBut the user's format requires listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for the main problem, the function f is from R to R. Then, differentiability at exactly one point. But how to phrase that? Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\nf is differentiable at exactly one point in R,\nf is not differentiable at any other points in R.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking whether such a function exists, not to prove something under those assumptions. So maybe the problem is structured as \"Prove or disprove the existence of a function f: R → R that is differentiable at exactly one point and nowhere else.\" But in the example given, the assumption included n being an integer, so perhaps here the assumption is that f: R → R, and the problem is to prove whether such a function exists with the differentiability condition.\n\nWait, the example given had an original problem that stated \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: The user's example was a problem where the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption says n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user is using it as an example of how to structure. So perhaps in their example, they erroneously added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't have that. So maybe the user's instruction is to filter out unrelated information and list the correct assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the assistant added an assumption not present in the original problem, which is incorrect. But maybe the example is just illustrative, not accurate. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking if there exists a function f: R → R differentiable at exactly one point. The problem is to structure this question by listing assumptions and then the problem.\n\nSo assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a function from R to R.\n\nBut the problem is about existence. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included the conditions given in the problem. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem had to be restructured by extracting the conditions. But if the problem is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n\", and in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer (which is given in the problem) and n is divisible by 7 (which might be part of the problem's actual condition but perhaps was misformatted). Hmm, perhaps there was a mistake in the example.\n\nBut back to the current problem. The problem is asking whether there's a function f: R → R differentiable at exactly one point. The assumptions here would be the properties that f must satisfy. However, since the problem is about existence, the assumptions might not be given in the problem but are part of the problem's statement. Wait, perhaps the user's intention is to extract the key conditions from the problem statement and list them as assumptions. For example, in the problem, the function must be from R to R, differentiable at exactly one point, and not differentiable elsewhere. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function from R to R.\n2. There exists exactly one point x in R where f is differentiable.\n3. For all other points y in R (y ≠ x), f is not differentiable at y.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function with domain and codomain R,\nThere exists exactly one point x in R where f is differentiable at x,\nFor every point y in R different from x, f is not differentiable at y.\n\nThen the problem would be to prove or disprove the existence of such a function.\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Is there a function f: R → R that has only one point differentiable?\" So the problem is to answer whether such a function exists. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions (properties required of f) and then the problem is to determine existence.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the actual question. In their example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had assumptions that n is integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. However, that seems inconsistent because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to show how to extract the key assumptions. Maybe in the example, the actual problem had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the answer. But I'm not sure. Maybe the example was incorrect.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the key is that the function is from R to R, differentiable at exactly one point, and nowhere else. So the assumptions are these three points. However, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\nf: R → R is a function,\nThere exists a point x ∈ R where f is differentiable at x,\nFor all y ∈ R \\ {x}, f is not differentiable at y.\n\nThen the problem is to determine if such a function exists.\n\nAdditionally, there's the second part about continuity at only one point. The user asks about that as an additional question, so perhaps that's a separate problem. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, so maybe we need to address both questions. Wait, the original question includes two parts: the main one about differentiability and the additional one about continuity. But according to the user's example, they included only the main problem. So perhaps the user wants to structure each part separately. However, the instructions say to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated info, and structure the problem. The original question includes both parts. But the example only addressed one problem. So maybe each part should be a separate problem. Alternatively, if they are related, perhaps include both. But the user's format example only had one problem. So perhaps we should structure each as separate.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem separately. However, the original question has two parts. Let me check the original question again:\n\nOriginal question:\n\"Is there a function f: R → R that has only one point differentiable? ... Additional question is that would there be any function f: R → R that has only one point continuous and not on any other points.\"\n\nSo there are two separate questions here. The user might want both structured. However, the example only had one problem. The user's format allows for one problem per structure. So perhaps two separate structures. But the user hasn't specified. However, the assistant should probably format both parts as separate problems. But according to the example, maybe just the main problem. But to be thorough, perhaps include both.\n\nBut the user's initial instruction says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps both parts are part of the same problem, but in the original question, they are two separate inquiries. So the assistant needs to decide whether to split them into two problems or present both in one.\n\nBut according to the example, the original problem had one main question, which was formatted. So perhaps the assistant should create two separate formatted problems here: one for differentiability and one for continuity. But given that the user's example only had one, maybe we need to check if the user wants both. However, the user's instruction says \"the problem\", suggesting singular, but the original post has two. So perhaps the answer should present both, each in their own format.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the formatted problem includes the problem statement as given. So perhaps the answer should include both parts as separate problems.\n\nHowever, the user hasn't specified whether to handle multiple questions. Since the original question includes two, the assistant should structure both.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problems would be:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\nThere exists exactly one point x in R where f is differentiable,\nFor all other points y in R (y ≠ x), f is not differentiable at y.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if there exists a function f: R → R that is differentiable at exactly one point and nowhere else.\n\nSecond problem (additional question):\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\nThere exists exactly one point x in R where f is continuous,\nFor all other points y in R (y ≠ x), f is not continuous at y.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if there exists a function f: R → R that is continuous at exactly one point and nowhere else.\n\nBut the original additional question was phrased as \"would there be any function...\", so the problem is to determine existence. However, the user's example's problem was to \"Prove that...\", but here it's an existence question. The format doesn't specify that the problem has to be a proof; it can be a question.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem statement was \"Prove that...\", so maybe the problem should be phrased as \"Prove or disprove the existence...\".\n\nBut in Vietnamese academic style, sometimes \"determine if\" is equivalent. However, the user's example used \"Prove that\", so perhaps the problem should be \"Prove or disprove that there exists a function...\".\n\nBut the original question is \"Is there a function...\", which is equivalent to asking for existence. So the problem statement would be \"Determine whether there exists a function...\".\n\nHowever, the user's example converted the original problem's \"Prove that for every integer n...\" into \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", with assumptions listed. So perhaps here, the problem statement should be \"Prove or disprove the existence of a function...\".\n\nBut to adhere to the user's example, perhaps the problem statement is \"Prove that there exists a function f: R → R that is differentiable at exactly one point and nowhere else.\" But the original question is asking whether such a function exists, not to prove its existence. So the problem is to determine existence, which could be phrased as \"Prove or disprove the existence of...\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is \"Is there a function f: R → R that has only one point differentiable?\".\n\nIn the example, the problem was rephrased as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the original problem was to prove for every integer n, which was misformatted in the example. But I think the key is to present the problem as stated, after filtering unrelated info.\n\nThe original question's title is \"Is there a function f: R → R that has only one point differentiable?\" So the problem is exactly that. The additional question is similar but for continuity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problems would be:\n\nFirst:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\nf is differentiable at exactly one point in R,\nf is not differentiable at any other points in R.\n\nProblem:\nIs there a function f: R → R that has only one point differentiable?\n\nSecond:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\nf is continuous at exactly one point in R,\nf is not continuous at any other points in R.\n\nProblem:\nIs there a function f: R → R that has only one point continuous?\n\nBut the user's example used \"Prove that...\" even though the original problem was a question. So perhaps the problem should be phrased as a statement to prove, even if it's an existence question. For example, \"Prove that there exists a function...\" or \"Prove or disprove that...\".\n\nIn academic contexts, such problems are often phrased as \"Prove or disprove: There exists a function...\".\n\nSo adjusting accordingly:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\nf is differentiable at exactly one point in R,\nf is not differentiable at any other points in R.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove the existence of a function f: R → R that is differentiable at exactly one point and nowhere else.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from R to R,\nf is continuous at exactly one point in R,\nf is not continuous at any other points in R.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove the existence of a function f: R → R that is continuous at exactly one point and nowhere else.\n\nThis seems more aligned with mathematical problem structuring.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentioned that for the complex function f(z)=|z|², differentiable only at z=0. Then asks about real functions. So the problem is inspired by that example. But the formatted problem should capture the essential elements without referencing the complex case, as per filtering unrelated information.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problems would be as above.",
