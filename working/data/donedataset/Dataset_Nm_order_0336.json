    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave includes breaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then stating the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the provided example, the original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but in the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted assumption added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe a mistake? Or perhaps the example had a different original problem. Hmm, maybe I should check that again. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems contradictory. Maybe that's a typo. But perhaps I should focus on the task here.\n\nThe current problem to format is the Linear independence of sin(x) and cos(x). The user's question is about proving that in the vector space of functions from R to R, sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent. The definition given is that two elements are linearly independent if the linear combination a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 implies a = b = 0. The user is asking how to formalize that, possibly by plugging in different x values.\n\nSo, to structure this according to the format, first list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n\n1. The vector space consists of functions from R to R.\n2. The functions considered are sin(x) and cos(x).\n3. Linear independence is defined as: if a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 for all x, then a = 0 and b = 0.\n\nWait, the problem statement in the original question says \"In the vector space of f: R → R, how do I prove that functions sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent.\" So the vector space is specified as real-valued functions with domain R. The functions are sin and cos. The definition provided in the question is the standard one for linear independence: the only solution to the linear combination being the zero function is a = b = 0.\n\nSo, the assumptions need to be broken down. Each on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is the set of all functions from ℝ to ℝ.\nThe functions sin(x) and cos(x) are elements of this vector space.\nLinear independence is defined as: if a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) equals the zero function for all x in ℝ, then a and b must both be zero.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent in this vector space.\n\nWait, but the original question already states the definition, so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The vector space is functions from R to R.\n- Two functions are linearly independent if the only scalars a, b satisfying a cos(x) + b sin(x) = 0 (as a function) are a = b = 0.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variables involved. Here, the problem is about functions in a vector space. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The vector space is C(ℝ), the space of continuous functions from ℝ to ℝ. Wait, but the original problem doesn't specify continuity. It just says functions. However, linear independence is considered in the space of all functions. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space consists of functions f: ℝ → ℝ.\nsin(x) and cos(x) are elements of this vector space.\nLinear independence in this vector space requires that if a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 for all x ∈ ℝ, then a = 0 and b = 0.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent. So the formatted problem would have the assumptions as above, and the problem is to prove their linear independence.\n\nWait, but the example given by the user had the original problem's assumptions split. So for the current problem, the user's question is how to formalize that the linear combination being zero implies a = b = 0. The answer would involve using specific values of x or differentiating and plugging in x values, but the structuring here is just to list the assumptions and the problem.\n\nSo, in this case, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The vector space is composed of functions f: ℝ → ℝ.\n2. The functions sin(x) and cos(x) belong to this vector space.\n3. Linear independence is defined as: For scalars a and b, if a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 (the zero function) for all x ∈ ℝ, then a = 0 and b = 0.\n\nBut perhaps each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is the set of all functions from ℝ to ℝ.\nAssumption:\nsin(x) is an element of this vector space.\nAssumption:\ncos(x) is an element of this vector space.\nAssumption:\nLinear independence of two functions in this vector space requires that any linear combination equal to the zero function implies all coefficients are zero.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions were more about the variables and conditions. For example, in their example, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, perhaps the key points are:\n\n- The vector space is functions from R to R.\n- The functions in question are sin(x) and cos(x).\n- The definition of linear independence applies to these functions in this space.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that they are linearly independent. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space consists of functions from ℝ to ℝ.\nAssumption:\nThe functions sin(x) and cos(x) are elements of this vector space.\nAssumption:\nLinear independence requires that a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 (as a function) implies a = 0 and b = 0.\nProblem:\nProve that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent in this vector space.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem already states the definition, maybe the assumptions can be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is the set of all functions f: ℝ → ℝ.\nAssumption:\nTwo functions in this space are linearly independent if the only scalars a, b ∈ ℝ satisfying a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 for all x ∈ ℝ are a = 0 and b = 0.\nProblem:\nProve that the functions sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent in this vector space.\n\nBut I need to check if each assumption addresses only one property or condition of one object. For example, the first assumption is about the vector space. The second is about the definition of linear independence for two functions. The third and fourth could be that sin and cos are in the space. Wait, but the problem mentions the functions sin and cos, so maybe we need to list their membership as separate assumptions.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is the set of functions f: ℝ → ℝ.\nAssumption:\nsin(x) is an element of this vector space.\nAssumption:\ncos(x) is an element of this vector space.\nAssumption:\nLinear independence of two functions in this vector space is defined by: a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 for all x ∈ ℝ implies a = 0 and b = 0.\nProblem:\nProve that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is asking how to prove the linear independence, given the definition. The key assumptions here are the structure of the vector space and the definition of linear independence. The problem is to prove the linear independence of these two specific functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is already stated clearly, and the assumptions are:\n\n- The vector space is functions from R to R.\n- The zero function is the function that is zero for all x.\n- Linear independence is defined as: if a linear combination of the two functions equals the zero function, then the coefficients must be zero.\n\nBut the user might have given the definition in their question, so perhaps the assumptions should include that definition.\n\nAlternatively, the original question says \"how do I prove that functions sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent. By def., two elements of a vector space are linearly independent if 0 = a cos(x) + b sin(x) implies that a = b = 0, but how can I formalize that?\"\n\nSo, the definition is part of the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions should include the definition as given. But since the user is asking to structure the problem, maybe the definition is part of the problem's context, so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is the set of functions f: ℝ → ℝ.\nAssumption:\nThe functions sin(x) and cos(x) are elements of this vector space.\nAssumption:\nTwo elements in a vector space are linearly independent if the only scalars a, b satisfying a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 (as the zero function) are a = 0 and b = 0.\nProblem:\nProve that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent in this vector space.\n\nBut perhaps the third assumption is redundant because it's the definition, but according to the example, the assumptions can include definitions if they are part of the problem's setup. So, in the example, the original problem had the definition included, and the formatted problem included the assumption about divisibility by 7, which might have been an error. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe that example had a mistake. But perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem includes the necessary conditions. However, in the current problem, the key is to list the assumptions given in the problem.\n\nThe original problem states that the vector space is functions from R to R, and the definition of linear independence is given. So to structure it:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space consists of all functions f: ℝ → ℝ.\nAssumption:\nThe functions sin(x) and cos(x) are elements of this vector space.\nAssumption:\nTwo elements u and v in a vector space are linearly independent if the equation a*u + b*v = 0 implies a = 0 and b = 0.\nProblem:\nProve that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent in this vector space.\n\nAlternatively, since the definition is specific to the functions sin and cos:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is the set of functions from ℝ to ℝ.\nAssumption:\nFor functions sin(x) and cos(x), linear independence requires that if a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 for all x ∈ ℝ, then a = 0 and b = 0.\nProblem:\nProve that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent in this vector space.\n\nBut maybe splitting into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is the set of all functions f: ℝ → ℝ.\nAssumption:\nsin(x) is an element of this vector space.\nAssumption:\ncos(x) is an element of this vector space.\nAssumption:\nLinear independence of sin(x) and cos(x) is defined by: a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) = 0 (as a function) implies a = 0 and b = 0.\nProblem:\nProve that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent.\n\nBut perhaps the last assumption is part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, the problem is to prove linear independence, which by definition is that the only solution is a = b = 0. So the definition is part of the problem's setup. Therefore, the assumptions include the vector space, the functions belonging to it, and the definition of linear independence.\n\nHowever, the problem is to actually show that this definition holds for sin and cos. So the assumptions are the setup, and the problem is the conclusion to prove.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumptions included the divisibility by 7, which may have been part of the problem's hidden conditions, but in reality, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which might have been a mistake in the example. However, focusing on the current problem, the user's question is about structuring the problem as per the format.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space consists of all functions from ℝ to ℝ.\nAssumption:\nsin(x) is an element of this vector space.\nAssumption:\ncos(x) is an element of this vector space.\nAssumption:\nLinear independence in this vector space requires that any linear combination equaling the zero function implies all coefficients are zero.\nProblem:\nProve that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last assumption can be phrased as:\n\nAssumption:\nTwo functions in the vector space are linearly independent if a linear combination equals the zero function only when all coefficients are zero.\n\nBut to make it specific to the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nFor scalars a and b, if a*cos(x) + b*sin(x) is the zero function, then a and b must both be zero.\n\nBut that is essentially the statement to prove. So perhaps not. Therefore, the key assumptions are the vector space, the functions being in it, and the definition of linear independence. The problem is to apply this definition to sin and cos.\n\nSo, the correct structuring would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vector space is the set of all functions f: ℝ → ℝ.\nAssumption:\nsin(x) and cos(x) are elements of this vector space.\nAssumption:\nLinear independence of two functions in a vector space is defined by: if a linear combination of them equals the zero function, then the coefficients must be zero.\nProblem:\nProve that sin(x) and cos(x) are linearly independent in this vector space.\n\nEach assumption is a single line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example's structure, even if the example had some inconsistencies. Therefore, this should be the formatted problem.",
