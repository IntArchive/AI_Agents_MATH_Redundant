    "Content": "A friend has submitted this problem to me: Let $0<a<b<1$ and $f:[0,1]\\to \\mathbb R$ be a differentiable function such that $$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\int_0^a f(x) dx}{a(1-a)}+\\frac{\\int_b^1 f(x) dx}{b(1-b)}=0$$ Prove that $\\displaystyle \\left| \\int_0^1 f(x)dx\\right|\\leq \\left(\\frac{b-a}2\\right)\\sup_{x\\in [0,1]}\\left|f'(x)+2\\normalsize{\\frac{\\int_0^a f(t) dt}{a(1-a)}}\\right|$ I haven't solved this yet, but I've made some progress: Since $\\frac{1}{1-a}\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\int_0^a f(x) dx\\right)+ \\frac{1}{b}\\left(\\frac{1}{1-b}\\int_b^1 f(x) dx\\right)=0$, the Mean Value Theorem yields the existence of $\\xi_a\\in[0,a]$ and $\\xi_b\\in[b,1]$ such that $$bf(\\xi_a)+(1-a)f(\\xi_b)=0$$\nThis implies $f(\\xi_a)$ and $f(\\xi_b)$ have opposite signs, thus there is some $c\\in [\\xi_a,\\xi_b]$ such that $f(c)=0$. We may suppose WLOG that $\\sup_{x\\in [0,1]} |f'(x)|<\\infty$ (there's nothing to prove otherwise). Let $M=\\sup_{x\\in [0,1]} |f'(x)|$. One can write $$\\displaystyle  \\begin{align}\\int_0^1 f(x)dx &= \\int_0^a f(x)dx + \\int_a^b f(x)dx + \\int_b^1 f(x)dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\int_0^a f(x) dx}{a(1-a)} \\left( a(1-a) -b(1-b)\\right) +  \\color{red}{\\int_a^b f(x)dx} \\end{align} $$ Note that $\\displaystyle \\color{red}{\\int_a^b f(x)dx} = \\color{green}{\\int_a^b (f(x)-f(a))dx} + \\color{blue}{(b-a)f(a)}$. Since $f(a) = f(a)-f(c) = f'(\\xi_c) (a-c)$, we have $|f(a)|\\leq M |a-c|\\leq M$. The Mean Value Theorem also gives $\\displaystyle \\left| \\int_a^b (f(x)-f(a))dx \\right| \\leq M \\int_a^b (x-a) dx = M \\frac{(b-a)^2}2$.\nPutting everything together we have the estimate\n$$ \\left| \\int_0^1 f(x)dx\\right|\\leq \\left(\\frac{b-a}2\\right)  \\left[2 \\left|\\frac{\\int_0^a f(x) dx}{a(1-a)}\\right| \\underbrace{\\frac{ \\left( a(1-a) -b(1-b)\\right)}{b-a}}_{\\leq 1} + \\color{green}{M (b-a)} +\\color{blue}{2M }   \\right]$$ and we get the bound $$ \\left| \\int_0^1 f(x)dx\\right|\\leq \\left(\\frac{b-a}2\\right)\\left(2\\normalsize{\\frac{\\int_0^a f(t) dt}{a(1-a)}} + 3M\\right) $$ which is not as sharp as what's required...

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the given conditions and what needs to be proven. The problem states:\n\nLet \\(0 < a < b < 1\\) and \\(f: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) be a differentiable function such that\n\\[\n\\frac{\\int_0^a f(x) dx}{a(1 - a)} + \\frac{\\int_b^1 f(x) dx}{b(1 - b)} = 0\n\\]\nProve that\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f(x)dx \\right| \\leq \\left( \\frac{b - a}{2} \\right) \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]} \\left| f'(x) + 2 \\frac{\\int_0^a f(t) dt}{a(1 - a)} \\right|\n\\]\n\nFirst, let me parse the assumptions and the goal.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1. \\(0 < a < b < 1\\): The limits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are between 0 and 1, with \\(a\\) less than \\(b\\).\n2. \\(f\\) is differentiable on \\([0,1]\\): So \\(f'\\) exists everywhere on the interval.\n3. The given integral equation holds: The sum of the two normalized integrals over \\([0,a]\\) and \\([b,1]\\) equals zero.\n\n**Goal:**\nProve an inequality involving the integral of \\(f\\) over the entire interval \\([0,1]\\), bounded by a term that includes the sup of \\(f'\\) plus another term involving the integral over \\([0,a]\\).\n\nThe user's attempt mentions using the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to find points \\(\\xi_a \\in [0,a]\\) and \\(\\xi_b \\in [b,1]\\) such that \\(b f(\\xi_a) + (1 - a) f(\\xi_b) = 0\\). This implies \\(f(\\xi_a)\\) and \\(f(\\xi_b)\\) have opposite signs, leading to a root \\(c\\) in between by the Intermediate Value Theorem. They then decompose the integral into parts and try to bound each part using MVT and estimates on \\(f'\\).\n\nHowever, their final bound isn't as sharp as required. The target inequality has the sup of \\(|f' + 2C|\\), where \\(C = \\frac{\\int_0^a f(t) dt}{a(1 - a)}\\). The user's bound includes \\(2C + 3M\\), where \\(M = \\sup |f'|\\). The problem wants the sup of \\(|f' + 2C|\\) instead. So maybe the approach needs to consider combining \\(f'\\) and \\(2C\\) directly.\n\nLet me think about how to restructure the proof to involve \\(f' + 2C\\). Let's denote \\(C = \\frac{\\int_0^a f(t) dt}{a(1 - a)}\\). The given condition is \\(C + \\frac{\\int_b^1 f(x) dx}{b(1 - b)} = 0\\), so \\(\\int_b^1 f(x) dx = -b(1 - b)C\\).\n\nThe user's decomposition starts with:\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x)dx = \\int_0^a f(x)dx + \\int_a^b f(x)dx + \\int_b^1 f(x)dx\n\\]\nBut using the given condition, \\(\\int_0^a f dx = a(1 - a)C\\) and \\(\\int_b^1 f dx = -b(1 - b)C\\). Therefore, substituting these into the total integral:\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x)dx = a(1 - a)C + \\int_a^b f(x)dx - b(1 - b)C = \\int_a^b f(x)dx + C(a(1 - a) - b(1 - b))\n\\]\nLet me compute \\(a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)\\):\n\\[\na - a^2 - b + b^2 = (a - b) + (b^2 - a^2) = (a - b) + (b - a)(b + a) = (a - b)(1 - (a + b))\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x)dx = \\int_a^b f(x)dx + C(a - b)(1 - (a + b))\n\\]\nBut the user wrote this as:\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x)dx = C(a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)) + \\int_a^b f(x)dx\n\\]\nWhich is the same. Then, the user splits \\(\\int_a^b f(x)dx\\) into \\(\\int_a^b (f(x) - f(a))dx + (b - a)f(a)\\). They use MVT on \\(f(a) - f(c)\\), where \\(c\\) is a root of \\(f\\), to bound \\(|f(a)| \\leq M |a - c| \\leq M\\), since \\(c \\in [\\xi_a, \\xi_b]\\) which is within [0,1], so \\(|a - c| \\leq 1\\). But maybe this is too crude?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to relate \\(f'\\) and the constant \\(C\\) more directly. Since the required inequality has \\(f'(x) + 2C\\), maybe consider defining a function that combines \\(f\\) and \\(C\\). Let's define \\(g(x) = f(x) + 2C x\\), but not sure yet. Alternatively, notice that \\(2C\\) is a constant term, so perhaps integrating \\(f'(x) + 2C\\) over some interval.\n\nWait, the term inside the sup is \\(|f'(x) + 2C|\\), so maybe we can express the integral of \\(f\\) in terms of integrals involving \\(f'(x) + 2C\\). Let's try integrating by parts or using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nAlternatively, consider that \\(C\\) is related to the integral over [0,a]. Let's see:\n\nGiven \\(C = \\frac{1}{a(1 - a)} \\int_0^a f(t) dt\\), so \\(\\int_0^a f(t) dt = a(1 - a)C\\). Then, if we write \\(f(x)\\) in terms of its derivative, we can use \\(f(x) = f(a) + \\int_a^x f'(t) dt\\) for \\(x \\geq a\\). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves both \\(f'\\) and the integral of \\(f\\), maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other integral inequalities. However, the presence of \\(C\\) complicates things.\n\nWait, the desired inequality is:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f(x)dx \\right| \\leq \\frac{b - a}{2} \\sup |f'(x) + 2C|\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(C = \\frac{\\int_0^a f(t) dt}{a(1 - a)}\\). Let's denote \\(K = \\sup |f'(x) + 2C|\\). Then, we need to show that the integral is bounded by \\(\\frac{b - a}{2} K\\).\n\nLet me look back at the user's decomposition:\n\nThey have:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = C(a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)) + \\int_a^b f dx\n\\]\n\nThen, they split the integral over [a,b] into \\(\\int_a^b (f(x) - f(a))dx + (b - a) f(a)\\). Then bound each term.\n\nBut maybe instead of splitting the integral that way, we should consider integrating \\(f'(x) + 2C\\). Let's see:\n\nIf we consider integrating \\(f'(x) + 2C\\) over [a, b], we get:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b (f'(x) + 2C) dx = f(b) - f(a) + 2C(b - a)\n\\]\n\nBut how does this relate to the original integral?\n\nAlternatively, since we need to bound \\(\\int_0^1 f dx\\), which is expressed in terms of integrals over [0,a], [a,b], and [b,1], and we have relationships from the given condition.\n\nWait, another thought: the given condition relates the integral over [0,a] and [b,1], so maybe we can express the entire integral over [0,1] as integrals over [a,b] plus terms involving those normalized integrals.\n\nGiven the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\int_0^a f dx}{a(1 - a)} + \\frac{\\int_b^1 f dx}{b(1 - b)} = 0\n\\]\n\nLet me solve for \\(\\int_b^1 f dx\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_b^1 f dx = - \\frac{b(1 - b)}{a(1 - a)} \\int_0^a f dx\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = \\int_0^a f dx + \\int_a^b f dx + \\int_b^1 f dx = \\left(1 - \\frac{b(1 - b)}{a(1 - a)}\\right) \\int_0^a f dx + \\int_a^b f dx\n\\]\n\nBut this seems similar to the user's expression. Let me compute the coefficient:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{b(1 - b)}{a(1 - a)} = \\frac{a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)}{a(1 - a)}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = \\frac{a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)}{a(1 - a)} \\cdot \\int_0^a f dx + \\int_a^b f dx\n\\]\n\nBut \\(\\frac{\\int_0^a f dx}{a(1 - a)} = C\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = [a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)] C + \\int_a^b f dx\n\\]\n\nSame as before. So the user's decomposition is correct.\n\nNow, the user writes the integral over [a,b] as \\(\\int_a^b (f(x) - f(a))dx + (b - a) f(a)\\). Then, they bound the first integral using MVT, getting \\(M \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2}\\), and bound \\(f(a)\\) by \\(M |a - c|\\), leading to \\(M\\) terms. But perhaps this is where the loss of sharpness occurs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express \\(f(a)\\) in terms of the integral over [0,a]. Since \\(C = \\frac{1}{a(1 - a)} \\int_0^a f dx\\), perhaps use the MVT on the integral to relate \\(f(a)\\) to \\(C\\). Wait, the integral over [0,a] is \\(a(1 - a)C\\). The average value of \\(f\\) over [0,a] is \\(\\frac{\\int_0^a f dx}{a} = (1 - a)C\\). So, by MVT, there exists some point \\(\\xi \\in [0,a]\\) such that \\(f(\\xi) = (1 - a)C\\). But not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider differentiating the expression involving \\(C\\). Wait, \\(C\\) is a constant with respect to \\(x\\), so maybe integrating \\(f'(x) + 2C\\) over [0,1]. Let's see:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 (f'(x) + 2C) dx = f(1) - f(0) + 2C\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't directly relate to the integral of \\(f\\). However, maybe integrating by parts or something else.\n\nWait, another angle: The term \\(f'(x) + 2C\\) suggests combining the derivative with the constant from the given condition. If we can express the integral of \\(f\\) in terms of \\(f' + 2C\\), that might lead to the desired inequality.\n\nLet's denote \\(g(x) = f(x) + 2C x\\). Then, \\(g'(x) = f'(x) + 2C\\). The sup term in the inequality is \\(\\sup |g'(x)|\\). Maybe expressing the integral in terms of \\(g\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\int_0^1 [g(x) - 2C x] dx = \\int_0^1 g(x) dx - 2C \\int_0^1 x dx = \\int_0^1 g(x) dx - C\n\\]\n\nBut how does this help? We need to bound \\(\\left| \\int_0^1 f dx \\right| = \\left| \\int_0^1 g(x) dx - C \\right|\\). Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, note that the given condition can be written in terms of \\(g(x)\\). Let's substitute \\(f(x) = g(x) - 2C x\\) into the given condition:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\int_0^a [g(x) - 2C x] dx}{a(1 - a)} + \\frac{\\int_b^1 [g(x) - 2C x] dx}{b(1 - b)} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\int_0^a g(x) dx - 2C \\int_0^a x dx}{a(1 - a)} + \\frac{\\int_b^1 g(x) dx - 2C \\int_b^1 x dx}{b(1 - b)} = 0\n\\]\n\nCompute the integrals:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^a x dx = \\frac{a^2}{2}, \\quad \\int_b^1 x dx = \\frac{1 - b^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\int_0^a g dx - 2C \\frac{a^2}{2}}{a(1 - a)} + \\frac{\\int_b^1 g dx - 2C \\frac{1 - b^2}{2}}{b(1 - b)} = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by denominators:\n\nBut this seems getting complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think back to the expression for \\(\\int_0^1 f dx\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = [a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)] C + \\int_a^b f dx\n\\]\n\nLet me denote \\(D = [a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)] C\\). So,\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = D + \\int_a^b f dx\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to bound this. The user's approach was to split the integral over [a,b] and bound each part. However, their bound involves \\(M\\), the sup of \\(|f'|\\), but the problem wants the sup of \\(|f' + 2C|\\).\n\nMaybe instead of bounding \\(f(a)\\) in terms of \\(M\\), we need to relate it to \\(C\\). Let's recall that \\(f(c) = 0\\) for some \\(c \\in [\\xi_a, \\xi_b]\\). Then, using the MVT on \\(f(a) = f(a) - f(c)\\), we have \\(f(a) = f'(\\xi)(a - c)\\), so \\(|f(a)| \\leq |a - c| \\sup |f'|\\). But \\(c\\) is between \\(\\xi_a \\in [0,a]\\) and \\(\\xi_b \\in [b,1]\\), so \\(|a - c| \\leq \\max(a - 0, 1 - a)\\). Wait, but this is still a bound in terms of \\(M\\), not \\(M + 2C\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the given condition to express \\(C\\) in terms of \\(f(\\xi_a)\\) and \\(f(\\xi_b)\\). From the user's note, by MVT, there exist \\(\\xi_a \\in [0,a]\\), \\(\\xi_b \\in [b,1]\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\int_0^a f dx}{a(1 - a)} = \\frac{f(\\xi_a)}{1 - a}, \\quad \\frac{\\int_b^1 f dx}{b(1 - b)} = \\frac{f(\\xi_b)}{b}\n\\]\n\nGiven the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(\\xi_a)}{1 - a} + \\frac{f(\\xi_b)}{b} = 0 \\implies b f(\\xi_a) + (1 - a) f(\\xi_b) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, as the user mentioned, \\(f(\\xi_a)\\) and \\(f(\\xi_b)\\) have opposite signs, leading to a root \\(c\\) in between. Maybe using this root \\(c\\), we can write \\(f(c) = 0\\), and express \\(f(x)\\) in terms of \\(f(c)\\) plus the integral of \\(f'\\) from \\(c\\) to \\(x\\). Since \\(f(c) = 0\\), \\(f(x) = \\int_c^x f'(t) dt\\). Then,\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\int_c^x f'(t) dt dx\n\\]\n\nChanging the order of integration:\n\nFor \\(x \\geq c\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_c^1 \\int_c^x f'(t) dt dx = \\int_c^1 \\int_t^1 f'(t) dx dt = \\int_c^1 f'(t) (1 - t) dt\n\\]\n\nFor \\(x \\leq c\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^c \\int_c^x f'(t) dt dx = \\int_0^c \\int_x^c (-f'(t)) dt dx = \\int_0^c \\int_0^t (-f'(t)) dx dt = \\int_0^c (-f'(t)) t dt\n\\]\n\nSo overall,\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\int_c^1 f'(t)(1 - t) dt - \\int_0^c f'(t) t dt = \\int_0^1 f'(t) [ (1 - t) \\chi_{[c,1]}(t) - t \\chi_{[0,c]}(t) ] dt\n\\]\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, integrating by parts:\n\nAlternatively, integrating by parts:\n\nLet’s integrate \\(f(x)\\) over [0,1]:\n\nLet’s take \\(u = f(x)\\), dv = dx, but that just gives the same thing. Maybe consider integrating against a specific function.\n\nAlternatively, note that since \\(f(c) = 0\\),\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\int_0^c f(x) dx + \\int_c^1 f(x) dx\n\\]\n\nBut \\(f(x) = \\int_c^x f'(t) dt\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\int_c^1 f(x) dx = \\int_c^1 \\int_c^x f'(t) dt dx = \\int_c^1 f'(t) \\int_t^1 dx dt = \\int_c^1 f'(t)(1 - t) dt\n\\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^c f(x) dx = \\int_0^c \\int_x^c (-f'(t)) dt dx = \\int_0^c f'(t) \\int_0^t dx dt = \\int_0^c f'(t) t dt\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\int_0^c f'(t) t dt + \\int_c^1 f'(t)(1 - t) dt = \\int_0^1 f'(t) \\cdot \\begin{cases} t, & t \\leq c \\\\ 1 - t, & t > c \\end{cases} dt\n\\]\n\nThis seems like a good direction. The kernel here is \\(k(t) = t\\) for \\(t \\leq c\\) and \\(1 - t\\) for \\(t > c\\). The maximum value of this kernel is \\(\\max(c, 1 - c)\\), which occurs at \\(t = c\\). But \\(c\\) is between \\(\\xi_a \\in [0,a]\\) and \\(\\xi_b \\in [b,1]\\), so \\(c \\leq \\xi_b \\leq 1\\) and \\(c \\geq \\xi_a \\geq 0\\). But since \\(0 < a < b < 1\\), the interval [a,b] is in the middle. Wait, \\(c\\) is in [\\xi_a, \\xi_b], which could be [0,1], but given \\(a < b\\), and \\(\\xi_a \\in [0,a]\\), \\(\\xi_b \\in [b,1]\\), so \\(c\\) is between 0 and 1. But we need a more precise location.\n\nBut if \\(c\\) is between \\(\\xi_a\\) and \\(\\xi_b\\), and \\(\\xi_a \\leq a\\), \\(\\xi_b \\geq b\\), then \\(c\\) must be in [0,1], but possibly crossing over [a,b]. However, since \\(a < b\\), maybe \\(c\\) is somewhere in [0,1], but not sure.\n\nHowever, the kernel \\(k(t)\\) reaches its maximum at \\(t = c\\), and the maximum value is either \\(c\\) or \\(1 - c\\), whichever is larger. But since \\(c \\in [0,1]\\), the maximum of \\(k(t)\\) is \\(\\max(c, 1 - c) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\) if \\(c = \\frac{1}{2}\\), but depending on \\(c\\). But in the problem, we have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) given, and \\(c\\) depends on them. However, the bound in the problem is \\(\\frac{b - a}{2}\\), which is related to the interval [a,b].\n\nWait, the user's final bound was \\(\\frac{b - a}{2}(2C + 3M)\\), but the problem wants \\(\\frac{b - a}{2} \\sup |f' + 2C|\\). So maybe the kernel here needs to be analyzed over [a,b], and the maximum length is \\(b - a\\). Alternatively, perhaps use Hölder's inequality, since we have an integral of \\(f'\\) times a kernel, and the sup norm of \\(f' + 2C\\).\n\nBut let's recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\int_0^c f'(t) t dt + \\int_c^1 f'(t)(1 - t) dt\n\\]\n\nBut we need to involve \\(f' + 2C\\). Let's write \\(f'(t) = (f'(t) + 2C) - 2C\\). Then,\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\int_0^c [(f'(t) + 2C) - 2C] t dt + \\int_c^1 [(f'(t) + 2C) - 2C] (1 - t) dt\n\\]\n\nThis splits into:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^c (f'(t) + 2C) t dt - 2C \\int_0^c t dt + \\int_c^1 (f'(t) + 2C)(1 - t) dt - 2C \\int_c^1 (1 - t) dt\n\\]\n\nCompute the integrals involving \\(2C\\):\n\n\\[\n-2C \\left( \\int_0^c t dt + \\int_c^1 (1 - t) dt \\right) = -2C \\left( \\frac{c^2}{2} + \\frac{(1 - c)^2}{2} \\right) = -2C \\cdot \\frac{c^2 + (1 - c)^2}{2} = -C (c^2 + (1 - c)^2)\n\\]\n\nNow, the other terms:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^c (f'(t) + 2C) t dt + \\int_c^1 (f'(t) + 2C)(1 - t) dt\n\\]\n\nLet me denote \\(K(t) = \\begin{cases} t, & t \\leq c \\\\ 1 - t, & t > c \\end{cases}\\). Then,\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 (f'(t) + 2C) K(t) dt - C (c^2 + (1 - c)^2)\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't seem directly helpful. However, the first integral can be bounded by:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 (f'(t) + 2C) K(t) dt \\right| \\leq \\sup |f'(t) + 2C| \\cdot \\int_0^1 K(t) dt\n\\]\n\nCompute \\(\\int_0^1 K(t) dt = \\int_0^c t dt + \\int_c^1 (1 - t) dt = \\frac{c^2}{2} + \\frac{(1 - c)^2}{2} = \\frac{c^2 + (1 - c)^2}{2}\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f(x) dx + C (c^2 + (1 - c)^2) \\right| \\leq \\sup |f'(t) + 2C| \\cdot \\frac{c^2 + (1 - c)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut this leads to:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f(x) dx \\right| \\leq \\sup |f'(t) + 2C| \\cdot \\frac{c^2 + (1 - c)^2}{2} + |C| \\cdot (c^2 + (1 - c)^2)\n\\]\n\nThis seems to introduce an extra term involving \\(C\\), which complicates things. Maybe this approach isn't the right way.\n\nLet me go back to the user's decomposition:\n\nThey have:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = C(a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)) + \\int_a^b f dx\n\\]\n\nThen, split \\(\\int_a^b f dx = \\int_a^b (f(x) - f(a)) dx + (b - a) f(a)\\)\n\nThey bound \\(\\left| \\int_a^b (f(x) - f(a)) dx \\right| \\leq M \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2}\\) using MVT, since \\(f(x) - f(a) = f'(\\xi)(x - a)\\), so integrating gives \\(f'(\\xi) \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2}\\), leading to the bound.\n\nFor \\(f(a)\\), since \\(f(c) = 0\\) and \\(c \\in [0,1]\\), \\(f(a) = f(a) - f(c) = f'(\\xi)(a - c)\\), so \\(|f(a)| \\leq M |a - c| \\leq M (a + |c|)\\). But since \\(c \\in [\\xi_a, \\xi_b] \\subset [0,1]\\), \\(|a - c| \\leq \\max(a, 1 - a)\\). However, the user bounds \\(|f(a)| \\leq M\\), which is a bit loose.\n\nBut perhaps instead of bounding \\(f(a)\\) by \\(M\\), we can relate it to \\(C\\). Recall from the given condition:\n\nFrom the user's MVT application, \\(b f(\\xi_a) + (1 - a) f(\\xi_b) = 0\\), and \\(\\xi_a \\in [0,a]\\), \\(\\xi_b \\in [b,1]\\). Also, \\(C = \\frac{\\int_0^a f dx}{a(1 - a)} = \\frac{f(\\xi_a)}{1 - a}\\), so \\(f(\\xi_a) = C(1 - a)\\). Similarly, \\(\\frac{\\int_b^1 f dx}{b(1 - b)} = \\frac{f(\\xi_b)}{b} = -C\\), so \\(f(\\xi_b) = -C b\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(f(\\xi_a) = C(1 - a)\\) and \\(f(\\xi_b) = -C b\\). Since \\(c\\) is between \\(\\xi_a\\) and \\(\\xi_b\\), and \\(f(c) = 0\\), we can use the MVT between \\(\\xi_a\\) and \\(c\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(\\xi_b\\):\n\nFor \\(f(a)\\), if \\(a\\) is close to \\(\\xi_a\\), then \\(f(a)\\) is close to \\(f(\\xi_a)\\), which is \\(C(1 - a)\\). Alternatively, using the Mean Value Theorem between \\(a\\) and \\(c\\):\n\n\\(f(a) = f(a) - f(c) = f'(\\eta)(a - c)\\) for some \\(\\eta \\in (a, c)\\). But this again relates \\(f(a)\\) to \\(f'\\), not directly to \\(C\\).\n\nWait, but we have \\(f(\\xi_a) = C(1 - a)\\). If we can relate \\(f(a)\\) to \\(f(\\xi_a)\\), then:\n\n\\[\nf(a) = f(\\xi_a) + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a f'(t) dt\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n|f(a)| \\leq |f(\\xi_a)| + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a |f'(t)| dt \\leq |C| (1 - a) + M (a - \\xi_a)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\xi_a \\in [0,a]\\), \\(a - \\xi_a \\leq a\\). So,\n\n\\[\n|f(a)| \\leq |C| (1 - a) + M a\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, if we use this bound in the expression for the integral:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f dx \\right| \\leq |C (a(1 - a) - b(1 - b))| + \\left| \\int_a^b (f(x) - f(a))dx \\right| + (b - a) |f(a)|\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the bound on \\(|f(a)|\\):\n\n\\[\n\\leq |C| |a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)| + M \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2} + (b - a)( |C| (1 - a) + M a )\n\\]\n\nExpand the terms:\n\n\\[\n= |C| [ |a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)| + (b - a)(1 - a) ] + M [ \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2} + (b - a)a ]\n\\]\n\nBut this still combines \\(C\\) and \\(M\\) terms, whereas the desired bound only has \\(C\\) inside the sup with \\(f'\\). This suggests that the user's approach might not be the optimal path.\n\nLet me think differently. The target inequality has \\(\\sup |f' + 2C|\\). Notice that \\(2C = 2 \\frac{\\int_0^a f dt}{a(1 - a)}\\). If I can express the integral of \\(f\\) over [0,1] in terms of \\(f' + 2C\\), then Hölder's inequality would give the bound.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating \\(f' + 2C\\) over some interval. Let's write:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) + 2C = f'(x) + \\frac{2}{a(1 - a)} \\int_0^a f(t) dt\n\\]\n\nBut this seems ad hoc. Maybe use the given condition to replace \\(\\int_0^a f dt\\) with something.\n\nFrom the given condition:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\int_0^a f dt}{a(1 - a)} + \\frac{\\int_b^1 f dt}{b(1 - b)} = 0 \\implies \\int_b^1 f dt = - \\frac{b(1 - b)}{a(1 - a)} \\int_0^a f dt\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\int_b^1 f dt = - \\frac{b(1 - b)}{a(1 - a)} \\cdot a(1 - a) C = -b(1 - b) C\\).\n\nTherefore, the total integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = \\int_0^a f dx + \\int_a^b f dx + \\int_b^1 f dx = a(1 - a) C + \\int_a^b f dx - b(1 - b) C\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = [a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)] C + \\int_a^b f dx\n\\]\n\nAs before. Now, to bound this, perhaps we need to consider the function \\(f(x)\\) over [a,b]. Let's express \\(f(x)\\) in terms of \\(f(a)\\) and its derivative:\n\nFor \\(x \\in [a,b]\\), \\(f(x) = f(a) + \\int_a^x f'(t) dt\\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) dx = \\int_a^b \\left( f(a) + \\int_a^x f'(t) dt \\right) dx = (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b \\int_a^x f'(t) dt dx\n\\]\n\nChanging the order of integration in the double integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b \\int_a^x f'(t) dt dx = \\int_a^b \\int_t^b f'(t) dx dt = \\int_a^b f'(t) (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) dx = (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b f'(t) (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this back into the total integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = [a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)] C + (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b f'(t) (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to bound this expression. Let's look at each term:\n\n1. \\([a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)] C\\): This can be written as \\(C [a - a^2 - b + b^2] = C [ (a - b) - (a^2 - b^2) ] = C (a - b)(1 - (a + b))\\). But not sure.\n\n2. \\((b - a) f(a)\\): Need to bound \\(f(a)\\).\n\n3. \\(\\int_a^b f'(t) (b - t) dt\\): Can be bounded using Hölder's inequality.\n\nLet me tackle term 3 first:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_a^b f'(t) (b - t) dt \\right| \\leq \\sup_{t \\in [a,b]} |f'(t)| \\int_a^b (b - t) dt = \\sup |f'| \\cdot \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut the problem wants the sup of \\(|f' + 2C|\\), not just \\(f'\\). So perhaps need to incorporate the \\(2C\\) term here.\n\nLet me write \\(f'(t) = (f'(t) + 2C) - 2C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f'(t) (b - t) dt = \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt - 2C \\int_a^b (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nCompute the second integral:\n\n\\[\n-2C \\int_a^b (b - t) dt = -2C \\cdot \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2} = -C (b - a)^2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f'(t) (b - t) dt = \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt - C (b - a)^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = [a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)] C + (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt - C (b - a)^2\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms involving \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n= C [a(1 - a) - b(1 - b) - (b - a)^2] + (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nLet me compute the coefficient of \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\na(1 - a) - b(1 - b) - (b - a)^2 = a - a^2 - b + b^2 - (b^2 - 2ab + a^2) = a - a^2 - b + b^2 - b^2 + 2ab - a^2 = a - b - 2a^2 + 2ab\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\na - b - 2a^2 + 2ab = a - b + 2a(b - a) = a - b - 2a(a - b) = (a - b)(1 - 2a)\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = C (a - b)(1 - 2a) + (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\((b - a)\\):\n\n\\[\n= (b - a) \\left[ -C (1 - 2a) + f(a) \\right] + \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nNow, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can bound each term:\n\n1. The first term is \\((b - a) [ -C (1 - 2a) + f(a) ]\\).\n2. The second term is the integral involving \\(f' + 2C\\).\n\nTo bound the absolute value:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f dx \\right| \\leq (b - a) | -C (1 - 2a) + f(a) | + \\left| \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt \\right|\n\\]\n\nBound the integral:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt \\right| \\leq \\sup |f'(t) + 2C| \\int_a^b (b - t) dt = \\sup |f' + 2C| \\cdot \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, the term \\( | -C (1 - 2a) + f(a) | \\). Need to relate \\(f(a)\\) and \\(C\\).\n\nRecall from earlier that \\(f(\\xi_a) = C(1 - a)\\) where \\(\\xi_a \\in [0,a]\\). Also, \\(f(a) = f(\\xi_a) + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a f'(t) dt\\), so:\n\n\\[\n|f(a)| \\leq |C| (1 - a) + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a |f'(t)| dt \\leq |C| (1 - a) + M (a - \\xi_a) \\leq |C| (1 - a) + M a\n\\]\n\nBut we need to bound \\( | -C (1 - 2a) + f(a) | \\).\n\nSubstitute \\(f(a) = C(1 - a) + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a f'(t) dt\\) (since \\(f(\\xi_a) = C(1 - a)\\)):\n\n\\[\n- C (1 - 2a) + f(a) = -C (1 - 2a) + C (1 - a) + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a f'(t) dt = C ( -1 + 2a + 1 - a ) + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a f'(t) dt = C a + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a f'(t) dt\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n| -C (1 - 2a) + f(a) | = | C a + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a f'(t) dt | \\leq |C| a + \\left| \\int_{\\xi_a}^a f'(t) dt \\right| \\leq |C| a + M (a - \\xi_a) \\leq |C| a + M a\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a - \\xi_a \\leq a\\) as \\(\\xi_a \\in [0,a]\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n| -C (1 - 2a) + f(a) | \\leq a (|C| + M)\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total bound:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f dx \\right| \\leq (b - a) a (|C| + M) + \\sup |f' + 2C| \\cdot \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut this still mixes \\(C\\) and \\(M\\), whereas the desired inequality has \\(\\sup |f' + 2C|\\). Let's recall that \\(M = \\sup |f'|\\), but the problem requires \\( \\sup |f' + 2C| \\). So perhaps we can relate \\(M\\) to \\( \\sup |f' + 2C| \\).\n\nNote that:\n\n\\[\n|f'(x)| \\leq |f'(x) + 2C| + |2C|\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nM = \\sup |f'(x)| \\leq \\sup |f'(x) + 2C| + 2 |C|\n\\]\n\nLet \\(K = \\sup |f'(x) + 2C|\\), then \\(M \\leq K + 2 |C|\\).\n\nSubstituting into the bound:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f dx \\right| \\leq (b - a) a (|C| + K + 2 |C|) + K \\cdot \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n= (b - a) a (3 |C| + K) + \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2} K\n\\]\n\nBut this still includes \\(|C|\\) and \\(K\\), which isn't matching the desired inequality. It seems this approach is not leading to the required result.\n\nAlternative idea: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Since we need to bound the integral in terms of the sup norm of \\(f' + 2C\\), maybe express the integral as an inner product with a suitable function.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing the integral as:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\text{something involving } f' + 2C\n\\]\n\nLet me try integrating by parts:\n\nLet’s consider integrating \\(f(x)\\) over [0,1] with some weight. Suppose we choose a weight function that will introduce \\(f' + 2C\\). Let’s define \\(w(x)\\) such that \\(w'(x) = 1\\) and \\(w(x)\\) is chosen to relate to the terms in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating \\( (f'(x) + 2C) \\cdot k(x) \\) where \\(k(x)\\) is a suitable kernel.\n\nWait, another approach. Let’s define \\(F(x) = \\int_0^x f(t) dt\\). Then, \\(F'(x) = f(x)\\). The given condition is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F(a)}{a(1 - a)} + \\frac{F(1) - F(b)}{b(1 - b)} = 0\n\\]\n\nWe need to bound \\( |F(1)| \\).\n\nLet me write this condition as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F(a)}{a(1 - a)} = - \\frac{F(1) - F(b)}{b(1 - b)}\n\\]\n\nLet’s denote \\(C = \\frac{F(a)}{a(1 - a)}\\), so the equation becomes \\(C = - \\frac{F(1) - F(b)}{b(1 - b)}\\), which implies \\(F(1) = F(b) - C b(1 - b)\\).\n\nThe goal is to bound \\( |F(1)| \\).\n\nExpress \\(F(1) = F(b) - C b(1 - b)\\). Then,\n\n\\[\nF(1) = F(b) - C b(1 - b)\n\\]\n\nBut \\(F(b) = F(a) + \\int_a^b f(x) dx = a(1 - a) C + \\int_a^b f(x) dx\\).

So we are again at the same decomposition.\n\nPerhaps the key is to handle the integral over [a,b] and relate it to \\(f' + 2C\\).

Maybe this substitution isn't leading us anywhere.\n\nLet me try a different route. Let’s consider the term inside the sup: \\(f'(x) + 2C\\). The user’s initial bound had \\(2C + 3M\\), but the problem wants it as a sup over \\( |f' + 2C| \\). Perhaps the key is to realize that \\(M\\) can be related to \\( \\sup |f' + 2C| \\), since \\(M \\leq \\sup |f' + 2C| + 2 |C|\\). But even then, combining these terms would not directly give the desired bound.\n\nWait, looking back at the user’s final bound:\n\nThey have:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f dx \\right| \\leq \\frac{b - a}{2} \\left( 2C + 3M \\right)\n\\]\n\nBut the problem requires:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\int_0^1 f dx \\right| \\leq \\frac{b - a}{2} \\sup |f' + 2C|\n\\]\n\nSo if we can show that \\(2C + 3M \\leq \\sup |f' + 2C|\\), but this isn’t generally true. Therefore, the user's approach must be missing something.\n\nPerhaps the key is to not bound \\(C\\) and \\(M\\) separately, but to consider the combination \\(f' + 2C\\). Let me revisit the decomposition:\n\nOriginal decomposition:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = C(a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)) + \\int_a^b f dx\n\\]\n\nThen, split \\(\\int_a^b f dx = \\int_a^b (f(x) - f(a)) dx + (b - a) f(a)\\)\n\nThen, bound each part. However, instead of bounding \\(f(a)\\) and the integral separately in terms of \\(M\\), perhaps express them in terms of \\(f' + 2C\\).\n\nConsider the term \\((b - a) f(a)\\). Let's express \\(f(a)\\) using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n\nSince \\(f(c) = 0\\), \\(f(a) = f(a) - f(c) = \\int_c^a f'(t) dt\\).

This complicates the bound.\n\nAlternatively, if \\(c\\) is in [0,1], then \\( |a - c| \\leq \\max(a, 1 - a) \\leq 1 \\). However, this leads to a bound involving \\(\\sup |f' + 2C| + 2 |C|\\), which again mixes terms.\n\nPerhaps instead of decomposing \\(\\int_a^b f dx\\) into \\(f(x) - f(a)\\), use a different decomposition that directly involves \\(f' + 2C\\). For example, write \\(f(x) = f(a) + \\int_a^x f'(t) dt\\), then substitute into \\(\\int_a^b f(x) dx\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) dx = (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b \\int_a^x f'(t) dt dx\n\\]\n\nChanging the order of integration:\n\n\\[\n= (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b f'(t) (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(f'(t) = (f'(t) + 2C) - 2C\\):\n\n\\[\n= (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt - 2C \\int_a^b (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nCompute the last integral:\n\n\\[\n-2C \\int_a^b (b - t) dt = -2C \\cdot \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2} = -C (b - a)^2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) dx = (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt - C (b - a)^2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for \\(\\int_0^1 f dx\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = C(a(1 - a) - C b(1 - b) + (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt - C (b - a)^2\n\\]\n\nCombine the \\(C\\) terms:\n\nFirst, expand \\(a(1 - a) - b(1 - b)\\):\n\n\\[\na - a^2 - b + b^2\n\\]\n\nThen subtract \\(C (b - a)^2\\):\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(a - a^2 - b + b^2) - C (b - a)^2 = C [a - b - a^2 + b^2 - (b^2 - 2ab + a^2)] = C [a - b - a^2 + b^2 - b^2 + 2ab - a^2] = C [a - b - 2a^2 + 2ab]\n\\]\n\nFactor:\n\n\\[\nC [a - b + 2a(b - a)] = C (a - b)(1 - 2a)\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f dx = C (a - b)(1 - 2a) + (b - a) f(a) + \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt\n\\]\n\nThis is the same expression as before. Now, taking absolute values and bounding each term:\n\n1. \\( |C (a - b)(1 - 2a)| = |C| (b - a) |1 - 2a| \\)\n2. \\( |(b - a) f(a)| \\)\n3. \\( | \\int_a^b (f'(t) + 2C) (b - t) dt | \\leq \\sup |f' + 2C| \\cdot \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2} \\)\n\nFor term 1, notice that \\( |1 - 2a| \\leq 1 \\) since \\(0 < a < 1\\). Thus,\n\n\\[\n|C| (b - a) |1 - 2a| \\leq |C| (b - a)\n\\]\n\nFor term 2, \\( |(b - a) f(a)| \\). Earlier, we found that \\(f(a) = C a + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a (f'(t) + 2C) dt - 2C (a - \\xi_a)\\). Wait, perhaps express \\(f(a)\\) in terms of \\(f' + 2C\\):\n\nFrom earlier, using \\(f(a) = C a + \\int_{\\xi_a}^a (f'(t) + 2C) dt - 2C (a - \\xi_a)\\), but this seems too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, recall that \\(f(\\xi_a) = C(1 - a)\\) and \\(f(\\xi_b) = -C b\\). Since \\(c\\) is between \\(\\xi_a\\) and \\(\\xi_b\\), and \\(f(c) = 0\\), we can use the Mean Value Theorem for integrals or other techniques to relate \\(f(a)\\) to \\(f' + 2C\\). However, this is getting too involved.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the fact that the user's approach leads to a bound involving \\(2C + 3M\\), but the desired bound is \\(\\frac{b - a}{2} \\sup |f' + 2C|\\), I think the key insight is missing in the decomposition. Perhaps integrating \\(f' + 2C\\) directly over a suitable interval and using the given condition to relate terms.\n\nLet me consider a different approach: let's define \\(M = \\sup |f'(x) + 2C|\\). Then, for any \\(x\\), \\( |f'(x)| \\leq M + 2|C| \\). However, the user's bound involves \\(M\\), but we need to express everything in terms of \\(M\\).\n\nAlternatively, consider the following: since \\(f'(x) + 2C \\leq M\\), then integrating this from \\(a\\) to \\(x\\) gives:\n\n\\[\nf(x) + 2C x - f(a) - 2C a \\leq M (x - a)\n\\]\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, integrate \\(f'(x) + 2C\\) over [a,b]:\n\n\\[\n\\int_a^b (f'(x) + 2C) dx = f(b) - f(a) + 2C (b - a)\n\\]\n\nThis equals \\(f(b) - f(a) + 2C(b - a)\\). Not sure how to use this.\n\nBut we can bound this integral:\n\n\\[\n|f(b) - f(a) + 2C(b - a)| \\leq \\int_a^b |f'(x) + 2C| dx \\leq M (b - a)\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n|f(b) - f(a) + 2C(b - a)| \\leq M (b - a)\n\\]\n\nWhich implies:\n\n\\[\n|f(b) - f(a)| \\leq M (b - a) + 2|C| (b - a)\n\\]\n\nBut again, this relates \\(f(b)\\) and \\(f(a)\\), not directly helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to refer back to the problem's requirement and see if there's a hint in the target inequality.\n\nThe target inequality has \\(\\left| \\int_0^1 f dx \\right| \\leq \\frac{b - a}{2} \\sup |f' + 2C|\\). This resembles the error bound in the trapezoidal rule, where the integral is approximated by the average of the function values at the endpoints times the interval length, and the error is proportional to the second derivative. But here, it's involving the first derivative and a constant term.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following identity:\n\nIf we have a function \\(f\\) with \\(f(c) = 0\\) for some \\(c \\in [0,1]\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\int_0^c ",
