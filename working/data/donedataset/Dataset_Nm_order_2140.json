    "Content": "Consider the following limit: $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{\\sum_{m=0}^{n}{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}{\\left[\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\\,\\frac{{{2k}\\choose{k}}{{2m}\\choose{m}}}{{{2n}\\choose{n}}}\\right]}}}=\\pi$$ I cooked this up while playing around with power series (details below). Is there a more direct way to prove this limit? Consider the functions $f(x)=\\frac{\\tan^{-1}(\\sqrt{1-x})}{\\sqrt{1-x}}$ , $g(x)=\\frac{\\pi/2-\\tan^{-1}(\\sqrt{1-x})}{\\sqrt{1-x}}$ . We write the power series: $$f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{(s_n\\pi-r_n)x^n},\\qquad{g}(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{(s_n\\pi+r_n)x^n}$$ where computing the first few terms suggests that $r_n$ , $s_n$ are rational. Indeed, we have $\\frac{\\pi/4-\\tan^{-1}(\\sqrt{1-x})}{\\sqrt{1-x}}=\\frac{g(x)-f(x)}{2}=\\sum{r_nx^n}$ , and $\\frac{1/4}{\\sqrt{1-x}}=\\frac{g(x)+f(x)}{2\\pi}=\\sum{s_nx^n}$ . Using $\\frac{d}{dx}[\\tan^{-1}(\\sqrt{1-x})]=-\\frac{1}{2(2-x)\\sqrt{1-x}}$ , we can use the power series for $\\frac{1}{2-x}$ and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x}}$ to calculate the power series for $(\\pi/4-\\tan^{-1}(\\sqrt{1-x}))$ , which consists of only rational coefficients. Combining this with the power series for $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x}}$ gives: $$r_n=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m-1}{\\frac{{{2k}\\choose{k}}{{2m}\\choose{m}}}{(n-m)\\cdot2^{k+m+n}}}}$$ We easily get $s_n=\\frac{1}{2^{2n+2}}{2n\\choose{n}}$ . Now, because no branch of $f(z)$ has singularities anywhere (the apparent singularity at $z=1$ is removable), the coefficients of the power series of $f$ must tend to zero. Hence $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{\\frac{r_{n+1}}{s_{n+1}}}=\\pi$ , and the desired limit follows after simplifying. Notes: 1) It is easily shown that: $$s_n\\pi-r_n=\\int_{0}^{\\pi/4}{\\sin^{2n}{\\theta}\\,d\\theta},\\qquad{s}_n\\pi+r_n=\\int_{\\pi/4}^{\\pi/2}{\\sin^{2n}{\\theta}\\,d\\theta}$$ 2) The above proof actually shows: $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2n+1}\\right)\\sum_{m=0}^{n}{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}{\\left[\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\\,\\frac{{{2k}\\choose{k}}{{2m}\\choose{m}}}{{{2n}\\choose{n}}}\\right]}}}=\\pi$$ which converges much faster than the given limit.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think OP did a really good job and this answer aims to indicate that it is plausible to obtain the specific type of generating functions like $\\arctan$ as stated by OP. Here  we  start with the binomial expression \\begin{align*}\nq_n:=\\sum_{m=0}^n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2m}{m}\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\\tag{1}\n\\end{align*} which corrresponds to OPs limit expression without the factor $\\binom{2n}{n}^{-1}$ and derive from it a generating function. Note that since $q_n=\\frac{1}{4^n}r_{n+1}$ OPs claim can be stated as \\begin{align*}\nq_n\\sim \\pi\\binom{2n}{n}\\sim\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{n}}\\cdot 4^n\n\\end{align*} where we use the asymptotic formula of the central binomial coefficient . Two aspects: We use the coefficient of operator $[z^n]$ to denote the coefficient of $z^n$ in a series. Recalling the generating function of the central binomial coefficient we can write for instance \\begin{align*}\n[z^n]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4z}}=\\binom{2n}{n}\\tag{2}\n\\end{align*} We can sum up coefficients $a_n$ by multiplication with $\\frac{1}{1-z}$ . If $A(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_nz^n$ we have \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{1-z}A(z)&=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^na_k\\right)z^n\n\\end{align*} Somewhat more general by multiplication with $\\frac{1}{1-pz}$ we have \\begin{align*}\n  \\frac{1}{1-pz}A(z)&=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^na_kp^{n-k}\\right) z^n\\tag{3}\n  \\end{align*} We obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\color{blue}{\\sum_{m=0}^n}&\\color{blue}{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2m}{m}\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}}\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^1\\sum_{m=0}^n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2m}{m}2^{n-m-k}z^{n-m}\\,dz\\tag{4}\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^1\\sum_{m=0}^n\\binom{2m}{m}z^{n-m}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}\\binom{2k}{k}2^{n-m-k}\\,dz\\tag{5}\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^1\\sum_{m=0}^n\\binom{2m}{m}z^{n-m}[t^{n-m}]\\frac{1}{(1-2t)\\sqrt{1-4t}}\\,dz\\tag{6}\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^1\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty\\binom{2n-2m}{n-m}z^m[t^m]\\frac{1}{(1-2t)\\sqrt{1-4t}}\\,dz\\tag{7}\\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^\\infty\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty[u^{n-m}]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4u}}z^m[t^m]\\frac{1}{(1-2t)\\sqrt{1-4t}}\\,dz\\tag{8}\\\\\n&=[u^n]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4u}}\\int_{0}^1\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(zu)^m[t^m]\\frac{1}{(1-2t)\\sqrt{1-4t}}\\,dz\\tag{9}\\\\\n&=[u^n]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4u}}\\int_{0}^1\\frac{1}{(1-2zu)\\sqrt{1-4zu}}\\,dz\\tag{10}\\\\\n&=[u^n]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4u}}\\left.\\frac{\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{1-4zu}\\right)}{u}\\right|_{z=0}^{z=1}\\tag{11}\\\\\n&\\,\\,\\color{blue}{=[u^{n+1}]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4u}}\\left(-\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{1-4u}\\right)+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}\\tag{12}\n\\end{align*} and we also get when deriving generating functions directly from (1) the same function as OP. The scaling factor $4$ in $\\sqrt{1-4u}$ is from formula (2) and indicates the connection between $q_n$ and $r_n$ as stated at the beginning of this post. Comment: In (4) we use $\\frac{1}{p+1}=\\int_0^1z^{p}\\,dz$ where $p\\ne -1$ . In (5) we do a rearrangement only. In (6) we apply the coefficient of operator by using (2) and (3) with $p=2$ . In (7) we change the order of summation by $m\\to n-m$ and we replace the upper index $n$ by $\\infty$ without changing anything, since $\\binom{2n-2m}{n-m}=0$ when $m>n$ . In (8) we apply again  the coefficient of operator to $\\binom{2n-2m}{n-m}$ according to (2). In (9) we use the linearity of the operators and apply the rule $[u^{p-q}]A(u)=[u^p]u^qA(u)$ . In (10) we apply the substitution rule of the coefficient of operator with $t=zu$ \\begin{align*}\nA(z)=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty a_m z^m=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty z^m [u^m]A(u)\n\\end{align*} In (11) we integrate obtaining the $\\arctan$ function. In (12) we finally evaluate the $\\arctan$ function at lower and  upper  limit and apply again  the rule $[u^n]\\frac{1}{u}A(u)=[u^{n+1}]A(u)$ as we did in (10).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original problem carefully. The title is about proving a limit involving a double sum equals π. The question starts by presenting the limit expression and mentions that the user came up with it while playing with power series. They provide functions f(x) and g(x), their power series expansions, and some coefficients r_n and s_n. The user also mentions using derivatives and integrating to find these coefficients and concludes that the limit of r_{n+1}/s_{n+1} is π, leading to the desired result. There are also notes about integrals and a faster converging version of the limit.\n\nMy task is to filter out the unrelated information and structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. The example given shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nLooking at the current problem, the main goal is to prove the stated limit equals π. The user derived this through power series and coefficients, but the core problem is the limit of the double sum. The assumptions would need to include any conditions or properties that the objects in the problem must satisfy. \n\nIn the problem statement, the limit is as n approaches infinity of a double sum over m and k. The terms involve binomial coefficients and some fractions. The user mentions that the coefficients of the power series of f(z) tend to zero because the singularity at z=1 is removable. However, this might be part of their solution approach rather than an assumption of the problem itself.\n\nThe problem as posed doesn't explicitly state any assumptions beyond the definitions of the terms in the sum. The functions f and g, their power series, and the coefficients r_n and s_n are part of the user's method to arrive at the limit. The actual problem to prove is the limit equals π, without additional conditions unless implied.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back, the original example had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no—the original example in the user's message seems to have a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made an error in their example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user wants me to follow their format regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is about proving the limit equals π. The user's own approach involves the coefficients tending to zero, but the problem itself doesn't state any assumptions beyond the limit expression. However, in the problem statement, the sum is over m from 0 to n and k from 0 to n−m. So, the variables m and k are non-negative integers such that m + k ≤ n. The problem is about taking the limit as n approaches infinity of this double sum. The terms involve binomial coefficients and other expressions. Are there any implicit assumptions here? For example, that n is a positive integer approaching infinity, which is standard in limits. Also, the binomial coefficients imply that k and m are non-negative integers. \n\nSo, possible assumptions could be:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- m and k are non-negative integers such that m + k ≤ n.\nBut wait, the problem statement already sums m from 0 to n and k from 0 to n−m, so the conditions on m and k are part of the problem's definition. However, the user's format requires assumptions as separate points. Maybe the key is to list the mathematical assumptions necessary for the problem to hold. For example, if certain convergence conditions are needed, but the problem as stated is to prove the limit equals π, so unless there are hidden conditions, maybe the only assumption is that n approaches infinity as a positive integer.\n\nBut the example given by the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the original problem had an unstated assumption, but in reality, the example might have been a different problem. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrects it. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to format the current problem into assumptions and problem, filtering unrelated info.\n\nLooking at the current problem, the user wants to prove the limit of the double sum equals π. The problem statement includes the limit expression. The rest of the question discusses the user's approach involving power series, functions f and g, coefficients r_n and s_n, etc. These are part of their solution method, not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the problem as the limit expression, and any assumptions needed for that limit to hold. \n\nBut the problem as stated is just the limit. The only assumption might be that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. However, in the example, the user added assumptions that were not in the original problem (like n divisible by 7). Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem actually had that assumption, but the user's presentation was different. Alternatively, perhaps the example is contrived. Since the user provided an example where they added an assumption not present in the original, maybe I need to check if the current problem has any hidden assumptions.\n\nWait, in the current problem, the user mentions that \"the coefficients of the power series of f must tend to zero\" because the singularity at z=1 is removable. This might imply that the limit relies on this condition, but is this an assumption or part of the proof? Since the user is asking for a more direct proof, the original problem's assumptions might not include this, as it's part of their approach. Therefore, the problem as posed is to prove the limit equals π without additional assumptions beyond the definition of the sum.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer approaching infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{\\sum_{m=0}^{n}{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}{\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\\,\\frac{{{2k}\\choose{k}}{{2m}\\choose{m}}}{{{2n}\\choose{n}}}}}}=\\pi$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement's limit expression has a bracket placement issue. Let me check the original LaTeX:\n\nThe limit is written as:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{\\sum_{m=0}^{n}{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}{\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\\,\\frac{{{2k}\\choose{k}}{{2m}\\choose{m}}}{{{2n}\\choose{n}}}}}}=\\pi$$\n\nBut the LaTeX seems to have a misplaced closing brace. Let me parse it. The inner sum is over k from 0 to n-m of [ (2^{n-m-k}/(n-m+1)) * (binom{2k}{k} binom{2m}{m}) / binom{2n}{n} ]. So the correct LaTeX should have the fractions properly enclosed. The original user's problem might have a typo, but I need to transcribe it as given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended:\n\n\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1} \\cdot \\frac{\\binom{2k}{k} \\binom{2m}{m}}{\\binom{2n}{n}}\n\nSo in LaTeX, that would be:\n\n\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1} \\cdot \\frac{\\binom{2k}{k} \\binom{2m}{m}}{\\binom{2n}{n}}\n\nBut in the original problem, the user wrote:\n\n\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\\,\\frac{{{2k}\\choose{k}}{{2m}\\choose{m}}}{{{2n}\\choose{n}}}\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1} \\cdot \\frac{\\binom{2k}{k} \\binom{2m}{m}}{\\binom{2n}{n}}\n\nSo the LaTeX is correct as written. Therefore, the problem is correctly expressed.\n\nNow, regarding assumptions. Since the problem is about proving the limit as n approaches infinity of this sum equals π, the only assumption needed is that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. But in the example provided by the user, they included an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which seems to be adding a condition not present in the original problem. This suggests that maybe in the current problem, we need to list assumptions that are implicit in the problem's setup.\n\nHowever, in the current problem, the sum is over m and k such that m + k ≤ n, with m and k non-negative integers. The problem doesn't state any restrictions beyond that, which are already part of the summation indices. Therefore, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. But perhaps the user's example shows that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", they added an assumption, which might be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the example was a mistake.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to structure the problem as in the example, perhaps the current problem's assumption is just that n is a positive integer. However, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which contradicts. That seems like an error, but perhaps the example is illustrative of extracting assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then adding \"n is divisible by 7\" changes the problem. This suggests that the example might be incorrect, but the user wants me to follow it regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a typo, and the correct assumption is that n is divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13). If n is divisible by 7, then maybe the expression is divisible by 91. So maybe the original problem had a missing condition, and the formatted problem corrects it. However, without seeing the original example's context, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. But since the example added an assumption not in the original problem, maybe the current problem should also extract any implicit assumptions from the context. However, the current problem's context doesn't mention any restrictions on n beyond it being the limit variable. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the user's example is flawed, but I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions under which the problem holds. For the current problem, if the limit is claimed to be π, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond n approaching infinity as a positive integer, which is standard in limits. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{\\sum_{m=0}^{n}{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}{\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\\,\\frac{{{2k}\\choose{k}}{{2m}\\choose{m}}}{{{2n}\\choose{n}}}}}}=\\pi.$$\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that was not in the original problem. Maybe the user intended that the assumptions are any conditions needed for the problem to hold, even if they are part of the problem's statement. For example, in the original example, maybe the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which might not be true unless n is restricted. Hence, the formatted problem corrects that by adding the assumption. \n\nIn the current problem, the limit is claimed to equal π. If there are no hidden assumptions, then the problem is as stated. However, in the user's solution approach, they mention that the coefficients tend to zero because the singularity is removable. But this is part of their proof, not an assumption of the problem. Hence, the formatted problem should not include this as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list the assumption that n is a positive integer approaching infinity, but since the limit is as n approaches infinity, the assumption is inherent. Maybe in the user's format, they list all conditions, even if they are part of the problem's statement. For example, in their example, the problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then, perhaps in the current problem, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. However, the example also added a second assumption, \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions that each object in the problem must satisfy. For example, in the current problem, the sum involves binomial coefficients, which require that the upper indices are non-negative integers. So the assumptions could be:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- m and k are non-negative integers such that m + k ≤ n.\n\nBut since m and k are summation indices determined by n, these are part of the problem's setup. The user's example didn't list conditions on summation indices, only on n. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nBut considering the user's example added an assumption not in the original problem, maybe I should look for any implicit assumptions. However, in the current problem, the limit is straightforward, and the expression is well-defined for positive integers n. Therefore, the assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the limit equals π.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{\\sum_{m=0}^{n}{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}{\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\\,\\frac{{{2k}\\choose{k}}{{2m}\\choose{m}}}{{{2n}\\choose{n}}}}}}=\\pi.$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumption is \"n is a positive integer\", and the problem is as stated.\n\nAlternatively, since the limit is as n approaches infinity, maybe the assumption is about the behavior as n becomes large, but typically, assumptions are about the variables' domains, not their limiting behavior.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{\\sum_{m=0}^{n}{\\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}{\\frac{2^{n-m-k}}{n-m+1}\\,\\frac{{{2k}\\choose{k}}{{2m}\\choose{m}}}{{{2n}\\choose{n}}}}}}=\\pi.$$",
