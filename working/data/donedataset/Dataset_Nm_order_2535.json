    "Content": "Let $0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0$ be an exact sequence of vector spaces.  I want to show that I have a canonical isomorphism $$\\det(B)= \\det(A) \\otimes \\det(C).$$ Here, \"det\" refers to the $n$-th exterior product where $n$ is the dimension of the vector space. Although it's easy to see that there is an isomorphism by fixing a basis, what is important to me is to show that this isomorphism is canonical.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Denote $p := \\text{dim}\\ A$, $q := \\text{dim}\\ C$ and $n := p+q = \\text{dim}\\ B$. Then I claim the following makes sense$$(\\ddagger)\\quad {\\bigwedge}^p A\\otimes {\\bigwedge}^q C\\to{\\bigwedge}^n B,\\quad (a_1\\wedge ...\\wedge a_p)\\otimes (c_1\\wedge ...\\wedge c_q)\\longmapsto a_1\\wedge ...\\wedge a_p\\wedge \\tilde{c}_1\\wedge ...\\wedge \\tilde{c}_q$$\nfor arbitrary preimages $\\tilde{c}_i$ of the $c_i$ under $B\\twoheadrightarrow C$. First, for fixed $a_i$ and $c_j$ the r.h.s. is independent of the choice of the $\\tilde{c}_i$: If the $a_i$ do not form a basis of $A$, the right hand side vanishes independently of the choice of $\\tilde{c}_i$. If the $a_i$ do form a basis of $A$, any other choice $\\tilde{c}_j^{\\prime}$ of preimage for $c_j$ differs from $\\tilde{c}_j$ by a linear combination of the $a_i$, which cancels in the r.h.s. of $(\\ddagger)$. Hence $(\\ddagger)$ makes sense as a map $A^p\\times C^q\\to {\\bigwedge}^n B$, and since it is antisymmetric and multilinear in the $A$- and $C$-variables, it descends to a morphism as indicated. Finally, if $(a_1,...,a_p)$ is a basis of $A$ and $(c_1,...,c_q)$ is a basis of $B$, the morphism $(\\ddagger)$ sends the generator $(a_1\\wedge ...\\wedge a_p)\\otimes (c_1\\wedge ...\\wedge c_q)$ of the l.h.s. to the generator $a_1\\wedge ...\\wedge a_p\\wedge \\tilde{c}_1\\wedge ...\\wedge \\tilde{c}_q$ of the r.h.s. corresponding to the basis $(a_1,...,a_p,\\tilde{c}_1,...,\\tilde{c}_q)$ of $B$, hence is an isomorphism.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem. The user wants me to list the assumptions and then the problem statement. \n\nFirst, the original question is about an exact sequence of vector spaces: 0 → A → B → C → 0. The goal is to show a canonical isomorphism between det(B) and det(A) tensor det(C). \n\nSo, the assumptions here need to be broken down line by line. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see. \n\nAssumptions:\n1. The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact. (That's one condition about the exactness of the sequence.)\n2. A, B, C are vector spaces. (Each is a vector space, so that's three separate assumptions? Wait, no. The problem says \"exact sequence of vector spaces,\" so maybe they're all vector spaces. But the instruction says each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Hmm. Maybe list each object as a vector space? Let's see the example given. In the example, the first assumption was that n is an integer, and the second that n is divisible by 7. So each line is a separate condition.\n\nSo here, the first assumption is that we have an exact sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0. Then, each of A, B, C is a vector space. Wait, but maybe the exact sequence being of vector spaces is one assumption? The problem states \"Let 0 → A → B → C → 0 be an exact sequence of vector spaces.\" So perhaps the first assumption is that the sequence is exact, and the second is that A, B, C are vector spaces. But maybe it's better to split into separate points. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is an exact sequence of vector spaces.\" That's a single assumption. But the instruction says each line should address one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n- A is a vector space.\n- B is a vector space.\n- C is a vector space.\n- The determinant (det) refers to the n-th exterior product where n is the dimension of the vector space.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"det\" refers to the n-th exterior product with n being the dimension. So each vector space's determinant is defined as their top exterior power. So maybe we need to note that for each vector space, det(X) is the top exterior product. But how to phrase that. Maybe:\n\n- For each vector space, det(X) denotes the top exterior product (i.e., the n-th exterior product where n is the dimension of X).\n\nBut perhaps the user wants each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n- A is a vector space.\n- B is a vector space.\n- C is a vector space.\n- For a vector space X, det(X) is the n-th exterior product where n is the dimension of X.\n\nWait, but \"for each vector space X\" might cover A, B, C. But maybe need to specify each. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\n- For each vector space X, det(X) is the top exterior power (i.e., the dim(X)-th exterior product).\n\nBut according to the example, they split conditions. For instance, in the example, the first assumption is n is an integer, the second that n is divisible by 7. So here, maybe:\n\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n- A is a vector space.\n- B is a vector space.\n- C is a vector space.\n- det(A) is the top exterior product of A.\n- det(B) is the top exterior product of B.\n- det(C) is the top exterior product of C.\n\nBut that's redundant. Alternatively, since the problem says \"Here, 'det' refers to the n-th exterior product where n is the dimension of the vector space,\" maybe we can phrase that as:\n\n- For each vector space X, det(X) is the dim(X)-th exterior product.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since the problem mentions \"the n-th exterior product where n is the dimension of the vector space,\" maybe:\n\n- For a vector space X, det(X) denotes the dim(X)-th exterior product of X.\n\nSo combining all these, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n- A is a vector space.\n- B is a vector space.\n- C is a vector space.\n- For each vector space X, det(X) is the dim(X)-th exterior product.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines, each addressing one condition. So maybe each line here is a separate point. Let me check the example again:\n\nExample's formatted problem had:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem: ...\n\nSo each line is a separate assumption. So applying that here:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n- A is a vector space.\n- B is a vector space.\n- C is a vector space.\n- For each vector space X, det(X) is the dim(X)-th exterior product.\n\nBut maybe the last assumption can be split if needed. Wait, the problem says \"Here, 'det' refers to the n-th exterior product where n is the dimension of the vector space.\" So perhaps that's one assumption: For each vector space X, det(X) is the dim(X)-th exterior product.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n- A is a vector space.\n- B is a vector space.\n- C is a vector space.\n- For each vector space X, det(X) is the dim(X)-th exterior product.\n\nProblem: Show that there is a canonical isomorphism det(B) ≅ det(A) ⊗ det(C).\n\nWait, the original problem says \"I want to show that I have a canonical isomorphism...\". So the problem is to show that det(B) is canonically isomorphic to det(A) tensor det(C). So the problem statement is as such.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 is exact.\n- A is a vector space.\n- B is a vector space.\n- C is a vector space.\n- For each vector space X, det(X) denotes the dim(X)-th exterior product.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there is a canonical isomorphism $$\\det(B) \\cong \\det(A) \\otimes \\det(C).$$\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if any assumptions are missing. The exact sequence being of vector spaces is covered by the first four assumptions. The definition of det is covered by the fifth. The problem is to show the canonical isomorphism. That seems to fit the example's structure.",
