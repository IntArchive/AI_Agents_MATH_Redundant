    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that $n >m>-1$ . Then $$ \\begin{align} \\int_{-\\pi /2}^{\\pi /2} (\\cos x)^{m} e^{inx} \\, dx &= \\int_{- \\pi/2}^{\\pi /2} \\left( \\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2} \\right)^{m} e^{inx} \\ dx \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{i 2^{m}}  \\int_{C} (z+z^{-1})^{m} z^{n-1} \\, dz \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{i2^{m}} \\int_{C} \\left(z^{2}+1 \\right)^{m} z^{n-m-1} \\, dz \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{i2^{m}}  \\int_{C} f(z) \\, dz \\end{align}$$ where $C$ is the right half of the unit circle traversed counterclockwise with quarter-circle indentations around the branch points at $z=-i$ and $z=i$ . Have the branch cut for $f(z)$ running down the imaginary axis from $z=i$ , and define $f(z)$ to be real-valued on the positive real axis. Now close the contour with a vertical line segment just to the right of $[-i,i]$ with a half-circle indentation around the branch point at $z=0$ . Just to the right of the branch cut and above the origin, $$f(z) = |z^{2}+1|^{m} |z|^{n-m-1} e^{i \\pi /2(n-m-1)} .$$ While just to the right of the branch cut and below the origin and above $z=-i$ , $$f(z) =|z^{2}+1|^{m} |z|^{n-m-1} e^{-i \\pi /2(n-m-1)} .$$ And under the assumption that $n>m>-1$ , the contributions from all three indentations vanish in the limit. For example, around $z=0$ , $$ \\Big| \\int_{\\pi/2}^{- \\pi/2} f(re^{it}) \\ i r e^{it} \\, dt \\Big| \\le \\pi \\ (r^{2}+1)^{m} r^{n-m}$$ which vanishes as $r \\to 0$ since $n>m$ . Then going around the contour, we get $$ \\int_{C} f(z) \\, dz + e^{i \\pi /2 (n-m-1)}\\int_{1}^{0} \\left| (te^{i \\pi /2})^{2} +1 \\right|^{m} |te^{ i \\pi /2}|^{n-m-1} e^{ i \\pi /2} \\, dt  $$ $$+ \\ e^{-i \\pi /2 (n-m-1)}\\int_{0}^{1} \\left| (te^{-i \\pi /2})^{2} +1 \\right|^{m} |te^{ -i \\pi /2}|^{n-m-1} e^{ -i \\pi /2} \\, dt = 0 $$ which implies $$ \\begin{align} \\int_{C} f(z) \\ dz &= e^{ i \\pi /2 (n-m)} \\int_{0}^{1} (1-t^{2})^m t^{n-m-1} \\, dt - e^{- i \\pi /2 (n-m)} \\int_{0}^{1} (1-t^{2})^{m} t^{n-m-1} \\, dt  \\\\ &= 2 i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} (n-m) \\right) \\int_{0}^{1}  (1-t^{2})^{m} t^{n-m-1} \\, dt \\\\ &= i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} (n-m) \\right) \\int_{0}^{1} (1-u)^{m} u^{n/2-m/2-1} \\, du \\\\ &= i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} (n-m) \\right) B \\left( \\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{m}{2}, m+1 \\right) \\\\ &= i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} (n-m) \\right) \\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{m}{2}) \\Gamma(m+1)}{\\Gamma(\\frac{m}{2}+\\frac{n}{2} + 1)} .\\end{align}$$ Then using the reflection formula for the gamma function, we get $$ \\int_{C} f(z) \\ dz= i \\pi  \\, \\frac{\\Gamma(m+1)}{ \\Gamma(1- \\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{m}{2})\\Gamma(\\frac{m}{2}+\\frac{n}{2}+1)} .$$ Therefore, $$ \\begin{align} \\int_{-\\pi /2}^{\\pi /2} (\\cos x)^{m} e^{inx} \\, dx &= \\frac{1}{i2^{m}} \\,  i \\pi \\, \\frac{\\Gamma(m+1)}{ \\Gamma(1- \\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{m}{2})\\Gamma(\\frac{m}{2}+\\frac{n}{2}+1)} \\\\ &=\\frac{\\pi}{2^m} \\frac{\\Gamma(1+m)}{\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m+n}{2}\\right)\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m-n}{2}\\right)} . \\end{align} $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the integral we need to evaluate is:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m e^{in x}dx$$\n\nAnd the expected result is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{2^m} \\frac{\\Gamma(1+m)}{\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m+n}{2}\\right)\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m-n}{2}\\right)}$$\n\nFirst, let me note the assumptions given. The user mentions that $\\Re(m) > -1$, which is important for convergence of the integral. Also, they assume $m$ is complex and $n$ is real. So, we need to handle those cases.\n\nHmm, Ramanujan is cited here, so maybe there's a clever substitution or identity that simplifies this. Let me think about possible approaches. \n\nOne common technique with integrals involving $\\cos x$ and exponentials is to use Euler's formula to rewrite the exponential in terms of sine and cosine. Let's see: $e^{in x} = \\cos(nx) + i \\sin(nx)$. But the integral is from $-\\pi/2$ to $\\pi/2$, which is symmetric around zero. Since $\\sin(nx)$ is an odd function, and $\\cos x$ raised to any power is even, the product of an even function ($(\\cos x)^m$) and an odd function ($\\sin(nx)$) would be odd. Therefore, the integral of the sine part over a symmetric interval would be zero. So, the integral simplifies to:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m \\cos(nx) dx$$\n\nBut the original integral has the exponential, so maybe keeping it as is might be better. Alternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me consider substitution first. Let’s set $t = x$, but that doesn't help. Maybe a substitution to relate it to the Beta or Gamma function since the result involves Gamma functions.\n\nAnother thought: the integral resembles the form of the Fourier transform or a generating function. Since we have $(\\cos x)^m$ multiplied by $e^{inx}$, perhaps expanding $(\\cos x)^m$ in terms of exponentials. Recall that $\\cos x = \\frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}$, so $(\\cos x)^m = \\left( \\frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2} \\right)^m$. Expanding this using the binomial theorem might be complicated, but maybe for complex exponents, we use a different expansion?\n\nWait, for non-integer $m$, the binomial expansion would involve an infinite series. That could be tricky. Alternatively, maybe express the integral in terms of the Beta function using substitution. The Beta function is related to the Gamma function, which appears in the answer.\n\nLet me recall that the Beta function is defined as:\n\n$$B(a,b) = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} (\\sin x)^{2a-1} (\\cos x)^{2b-1} dx$$\n\nBut here we have $(\\cos x)^m e^{inx}$. Hmm, not sure if directly applicable. Maybe another substitution. Let's try changing variables. Let $u = \\sin x$, then $du = \\cos x dx$, but not sure. Alternatively, use substitution to turn the integral into a form that can be expressed via the Gamma function.\n\nWait, another idea: use contour integration. Since the integrand has exponentials, maybe extending to the complex plane. But the limits are from $-\\pi/2$ to $\\pi/2$, which complicates the contour. Alternatively, extend the integral to a full circle, but the interval here is only half a circle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing the integral as the real part of a complex integral. Wait, but the original integral is already complex due to the exponential. Maybe use substitution $z = e^{ix}$, but then the limits would be from $e^{-i\\pi/2}$ to $e^{i\\pi/2}$, which is a semicircle in the complex plane. Then, $dz = i e^{ix} dx = iz dx$, so $dx = dz/(iz)$. Then, $\\cos x = (z + 1/z)/2$, so $(\\cos x)^m = \\left( \\frac{z + 1/z}{2} \\right)^m$, and $e^{in x} = z^n$. Substituting into the integral:\n\n$$\\int_{C} \\left( \\frac{z + 1/z}{2} \\right)^m z^n \\frac{dz}{iz}$$\n\nWhere $C$ is the semicircle from $-i$ to $i$ in the complex plane. Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe evaluating this contour integral using residues? But residues would require identifying poles inside the contour. The integrand here is $\\left( z + 1/z \\right)^m z^n / (i 2^m z)$. Simplifying:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{i 2^m} \\int_{C} \\left( z + \\frac{1}{z} \\right)^m z^{n - 1} dz$$\n\nBut expanding $\\left( z + 1/z \\right)^m$ is non-trivial for non-integer $m$. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nLet me think again about substitution. Since the integral is over $-\\pi/2$ to $\\pi/2$, maybe using substitution $y = \\sin x$ or $y = \\tan x$? Let's try $t = \\sin x$, then $dt = \\cos x dx$, and $\\cos x = \\sqrt{1 - t^2}$. But then the exponent $m$ on $\\cos x$ would become $(1 - t^2)^{m/2}$, and we have $dx = dt / \\sqrt{1 - t^2}$. The integral becomes:\n\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} (1 - t^2)^{m/2} e^{in \\arcsin t} \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1 - t^2}}$$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} (1 - t^2)^{(m - 1)/2} e^{in \\arcsin t} dt$$\n\nThis seems more complicated. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: use integral representations of hypergeometric functions or some special functions. The presence of Gamma functions in the result suggests that the integral relates to the Beta function or the Gamma function through some identity.\n\nWait, let's recall that the Gamma function has an integral representation:\n\n$$\\Gamma(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{z - 1} e^{-t} dt$$\n\nBut not sure how to connect that here. Alternatively, the Beta function:\n\n$$B(a,b) = \\int_{0}^{1} t^{a - 1}(1 - t)^{b - 1} dt$$\n\nBut again, not directly obvious.\n\nWait, maybe changing variables in the original integral. Let me set $x = \\theta$, so the integral becomes:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos \\theta)^m e^{in \\theta} d\\theta$$\n\nLet me consider extending the integral to $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$ but the function $(\\cos \\theta)^m$ is even and periodic, but the original limits are only from $-\\pi/2$ to $\\pi/2$. Maybe a substitution to make the limits go from 0 to $\\pi/2$ and double it? Since the integrand is even if we consider the real part, but since $e^{in\\theta}$ is complex, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let’s consider the substitution $u = \\theta + \\pi/2$, shifting the interval to $0$ to $\\pi$. Let $u = x + \\pi/2$, then when $x = -\\pi/2$, $u = 0$, and when $x = \\pi/2$, $u = \\pi$. So the integral becomes:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\cos(u - \\pi/2))^m e^{in(u - \\pi/2)} du$$\n\nBut $\\cos(u - \\pi/2) = \\sin u$, so this becomes:\n\n$$e^{-i n \\pi/2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\sin u)^m e^{in u} du$$\n\nHmm, so the integral becomes:\n\n$$e^{-i n \\pi/2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\sin u)^m e^{in u} du$$\n\nNow, this integral might be more familiar. Let me check standard integrals involving $(\\sin u)^m e^{inu}$. \n\nI recall that integrals of the form $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\sin u)^m e^{i n u} du$ can be evaluated using the Gamma function. Let me look up or recall the formula.\n\nAlternatively, express $(\\sin u)^m$ in terms of exponentials:\n\n$\\sin u = \\frac{e^{iu} - e^{-iu}}{2i}$, so $(\\sin u)^m = \\left( \\frac{e^{iu} - e^{-iu}}{2i} \\right)^m$. Then, expanding this using the binomial theorem for general exponents would involve a series expansion, but maybe for integer $m$, but here $m$ is complex. So that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the integral representation of the Gamma function. Wait, maybe using substitution $t = e^{iu}$, but then the limits would be from $1$ to $-1$ around the upper half circle. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the Beta function identity. Wait, consider that the integral over $0$ to $\\pi$ of $(\\sin u)^m e^{i n u} du$ can be related to the Beta function. Let me split the exponential into cosine and sine again. But as before, the integral would have real and imaginary parts. However, since we're dealing with complex exponents, maybe another approach.\n\nAnother idea: use the substitution $v = u - \\pi/2$, which would shift the integral back, but not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps use the integral representation of the Gamma function in terms of trigonometric functions. There is a formula called the Euler integral of the first kind for the Beta function:\n\n$$B(a,b) = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} (\\sin \\theta)^{2a - 1} (\\cos \\theta)^{2b - 1} d\\theta$$\n\nBut here we have $(\\sin u)^m e^{i n u}$. Hmm. Let me consider if $n$ is an integer. The problem states $n$ is real, not necessarily integer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, express the exponential as a power series. Let me write $e^{in u} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(i n u)^k}{k!}$, but then integrating term by term might not converge nicely. Alternatively, since the integral is over a finite interval, maybe expand $(\\sin u)^m$ in a Fourier series. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, I remember that integrals of the form $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\sin u)^m e^{i n u} du$ can be expressed using the Gamma function. Let me check Gradshteyn and Ryzhik's tables. In the 3.915 section, there is an integral:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\sin x)^{\\nu - 1} e^{i \\beta x} dx = \\frac{\\pi e^{i \\beta \\pi/2} }{2^{\\nu - 1} \\nu} \\frac{1}{B\\left( \\frac{\\nu + \\beta + 1}{2}, \\frac{\\nu - \\beta + 1}{2} \\right) }$$\n\nWait, I need to check the exact formula, but perhaps something similar exists. Alternatively, using the integral representation of the hypergeometric function. \n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution $t = \\sin u$, but then the integral becomes more complicated. Let me try substitution $t = \\cos u$, then $dt = -\\sin u du$, but the limits would go from $1$ to $-1$. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: use the expansion of $(\\cos x)^m$ in terms of Fourier series. If $(\\cos x)^m$ can be written as a sum of exponentials, then multiplying by $e^{in x}$ and integrating term by term. However, for non-integer $m$, the Fourier series expansion becomes a Fourier transform, which is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, using the Beta function identity with substitution. Let me think again about the original integral:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m e^{in x}dx$$\n\nLet me make the substitution $x = 2\\theta - \\pi/2$, which maps $\\theta$ from $0$ to $\\pi/2$ as $x$ goes from $-\\pi/2$ to $\\pi/2$. Wait, no. Let's instead use substitution $\\theta = x + \\pi/2$, which was done earlier. Wait, we already tried that. Alternatively, use substitution $t = 2x$, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the integral representation of the Gamma function with a substitution that links $\\cos x$ to a variable in $[0,1]$. Let me set $t = \\cos^2 x$, then $dt = -2 \\cos x \\sin x dx$, but not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: recognize that $(\\cos x)^m e^{in x}$ can be written as $(\\cos x)^m (\\cos(n x) + i \\sin(n x))$, and as we noticed before, the sine part integrates to zero due to oddness. So the integral simplifies to twice the integral from $0$ to $\\pi/2$ of $(\\cos x)^m \\cos(n x) dx$. Let's verify that.\n\nOriginal integral:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m e^{in x} dx = \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m \\cos(n x) dx + i \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m \\sin(n x) dx$$\n\nSince $(\\cos x)^m$ is even and $\\cos(n x)$ is even, their product is even. The sine term is odd, so the integral over symmetric limits cancels out. Thus, the integral becomes:\n\n$$2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m \\cos(n x) dx$$\n\nSo now the problem reduces to evaluating:\n\n$$2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m \\cos(n x) dx$$\n\nWhich is supposed to equal:\n\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{2^m} \\frac{\\Gamma(1+m)}{\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m+n}{2}\\right)\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m-n}{2}\\right)}$$\n\nSo, maybe this integral is known. Let me check standard integrals.\n\nIn Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, 3.631(9): \n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\cos(2 b x) \\cos^{2 a - 1} x dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2^{2 a}} \\frac{\\Gamma(a + b) \\Gamma(a - b)}{\\Gamma(a + 1/2) \\Gamma(2 a)}$$\n\nWait, not exactly matching. Let me check another formula. 3.631(17):\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\cos^{2 \\nu - 1} x \\cos a x dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2^{2 \\nu} \\nu} \\frac{1}{B(\\nu + (a/2), \\nu - (a/2))}$$\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, using integral representations in terms of Beta functions.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the integral can be related to the Beta function through substitution. Let me use substitution $t = \\sin x$, but then $\\cos x = \\sqrt{1 - t^2}$, $dx = dt / \\sqrt{1 - t^2}$, so the integral becomes:\n\n$$2 \\int_{0}^{1} (1 - t^2)^{m/2} \\cos(n \\arcsin t) \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{1 - t^2}}$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$2 \\int_{0}^{1} (1 - t^2)^{(m - 1)/2} \\cos(n \\arcsin t) dt$$\n\nLet me set $t = \\sin \\theta$, so $\\theta = \\arcsin t$, $dt = \\cos \\theta d\\theta$, then the integral becomes:\n\n$$2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos \\theta)^{m} \\cos(n \\theta) d\\theta$$\n\nWait, that's back to the same integral. Hmm, circular.\n\nAlternatively, use the expansion of $\\cos(n x)$ in terms of Chebyshev polynomials or some orthogonal polynomials, but not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: use the integral representation of the Gamma function. Let me recall that for $\\text{Re}(a) > 0$, $\\text{Re}(b) > 0$,\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\sin^{2a - 1} \\theta \\cos^{2b - 1} \\theta d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} B(a, b) = \\frac{\\Gamma(a) \\Gamma(b)}{2 \\Gamma(a + b)}$$\n\nBut here, we have $\\cos^m x \\cos(n x)$. Not directly applicable. However, if we can express $\\cos(n x)$ as a hypergeometric function or use generating functions.\n\nAlternatively, express $\\cos(n x)$ as the real part of $e^{i n x}$, but we already did that. Maybe use generating function for $\\cos(n x)$. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, use integration by parts. Let me try differentiating with respect to a parameter. Suppose we let $I(m, n) = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m \\cos(n x) dx$. Maybe find a recurrence relation for $I(m, n)$. Differentiate with respect to $m$ or $n$.\n\nAlternatively, use the substitution $u = \\cos x$, so $du = -\\sin x dx$, but then the integral becomes:\n\n$$I = \\int_{0}^{1} u^m \\cos(n \\arccos u) \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{1 - u^2}}$$\n\nWait, because if $x = \\arccos u$, then $u = \\cos x$, $du = -\\sin x dx$, so $dx = -du / \\sqrt{1 - u^2}$, and the limits go from $1$ to $0$, so flipping them gives:\n\n$$I = \\int_{0}^{1} u^m \\cos(n \\arccos u) \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{1 - u^2}}$$\n\nBut $\\cos(n \\arccos u)$ is the definition of the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind, $T_n(u)$. So,\n\n$$I = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u^m T_n(u)}{\\sqrt{1 - u^2}} du$$\n\nBut integrating Chebyshev polynomials against this weight might be known. However, since $n$ is real here, not necessarily an integer, Chebyshev polynomials are defined for integer $n$, so this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, express $T_n(u)$ in terms of hypergeometric functions. For general $n$, $T_n(u) = \\cos(n \\arccos u)$, which can be expressed using the hypergeometric function. But I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAnother idea: use the integral representation of the hypergeometric function. The hypergeometric function $_2F_1$ has an integral representation:\n\n$$_2F_1(a, b; c; z) = \\frac{\\Gamma(c)}{\\Gamma(b) \\Gamma(c - b)} \\int_{0}^{1} t^{b - 1} (1 - t)^{c - b - 1} (1 - z t)^{-a} dt$$\n\nBut how to relate this to our integral? Let me see.\n\nWait, if we consider the integral $I = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u^m \\cos(n \\arccos u)}{\\sqrt{1 - u^2}} du$, perhaps expand $\\cos(n \\arccos u)$ as a series. Let me recall that for real $n$, $\\cos(n \\theta)$ can be expressed as a series expansion. Specifically, using the identity:\n\n$$\\cos(n \\theta) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k (n)^{2k} \\theta^{2k}}{(2k)!}$$\n\nBut substituting $\\theta = \\arccos u$ complicates things. Alternatively, use the expansion in terms of Gegenbauer polynomials or something else.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for the integral:\n\n$$I = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m \\cos(n x) dx$$\n\nWe can use the series expansion for $\\cos(n x)$:\n\n$$\\cos(n x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k (n x)^{2k}}{(2k)!}$$\n\nThen interchange the integral and the sum:\n\n$$I = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k n^{2k}}{(2k)!} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} x^{2k} (\\cos x)^m dx$$\n\nBut integrating $x^{2k} (\\cos x)^m$ is still complicated. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, use the Laplace transform. Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: the integral resembles the real part of the Fourier transform of $(\\cos x)^m$ on a finite interval. There might be a convolution theorem or something similar in Fourier analysis that could be used here.\n\nAlternatively, use the method of stationary phase or steepest descent for asymptotic evaluation, but since we need an exact result, this might not be helpful.\n\nWait, I remember that integrals of the form $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} e^{i n x} (\\sin x)^m dx$ can be expressed using Gamma functions. Let me try to recall the formula.\n\nYes, for example, in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, 3.631 (9):\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi} e^{i n x} (\\sin x)^{\\nu - 1} dx = \\pi e^{i n \\pi / 2} \\frac{2^{1 - \\nu} \\Gamma(\\nu)}{\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{\\nu + n + 1}{2} \\right) \\Gamma\\left( \\frac{\\nu - n + 1}{2} \\right)}$$\n\nProvided that $\\Re(\\nu) > -1$. This looks very similar to our problem. \n\nIn our case, after the substitution $u = x + \\pi/2$, we had:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} (\\cos x)^m e^{i n x} dx = e^{-i n \\pi/2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\sin u)^m e^{i n u} du$$\n\nThen, applying the formula from G&R 3.631 (9):\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\sin u)^m e^{i n u} du = \\pi e^{i n \\pi / 2} \\frac{2^{1 - (m + 1)} \\Gamma(m + 1)}{\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{(m + 1) + n + 1}{2} \\right) \\Gamma\\left( \\frac{(m + 1) - n + 1}{2} \\right)}$$\n\nWait, but the formula has $\\nu - 1$ as the exponent. So if in G&R 3.631 (9), the integral is $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\sin x)^{\\nu - 1} e^{i \\mu x} dx = \\pi e^{i \\mu \\pi /2} \\frac{2^{1 - \\nu} \\Gamma(\\nu)}{\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{\\nu + \\mu + 1}{2} \\right) \\Gamma\\left( \\frac{\\nu - \\mu + 1}{2} \\right)}$.\n\nSo, comparing to our case, the exponent is $m$ on $\\sin u$, so we set $\\nu - 1 = m$, hence $\\nu = m + 1$. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi} (\\sin u)^m e^{i n u} du = \\pi e^{i n \\pi /2} \\frac{2^{1 - (m + 1)} \\Gamma(m + 1)}{\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{(m + 1) + n + 1}{2} \\right) \\Gamma\\left( \\frac{(m + 1) - n + 1}{2} \\right)}$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$= \\pi e^{i n \\pi /2} \\frac{2^{-m} \\Gamma(m + 1)}{\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{m + n + 2}{2} \\right) \\Gamma\\left( \\frac{m - n + 2}{2} \\right)}$$\n\nThen, multiplying by $e^{-i n \\pi /2}$ from the substitution:\n\n$$e^{-i n \\pi /2} \\cdot \\pi e^{i n \\pi /2} \\frac{2^{-m} \\Gamma(m + 1)}{\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{m + n + 2}{2} \\right) \\Gamma\\left( \\frac{m - n + 2}{2} \\right)} = \\pi \\frac{2^{-m} \\Gamma(m + 1)}{\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{m + n + 2}{2} \\right) \\Gamma\\left( \\frac{m - n + 2}{2} \\right)}$$\n\nBut the desired result is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{2^m} \\frac{\\Gamma(1 + m)}{\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m+n}{2}\\right)\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m - n}{2}\\right)}$$\n\nNotice that:\n\n$$\\frac{m + n + 2}{2} = 1 + \\frac{m + n}{2}$$\n\nSimilarly for the other Gamma function argument. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{2^m} \\frac{\\Gamma(1 + m)}{\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m + n}{2}\\right)\\Gamma \\left(1+ \\frac{m - n}{2}\\right)}$$\n\nWhich matches the desired result. Therefore, using the integral formula from G&R, we can derive the result. \n\nSo, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the integral after substitution as a known form in standard tables.\n2. Apply the substitution to shift the interval and convert cosine to sine.\n3. Use the symmetry to eliminate the imaginary part.\n4. Look up the integral involving $(\\sin x)^m e^{i n x}$ and apply the formula.\n5. Adjust the variables to match the given problem's parameters.\n\nTherefore, the proof involves these substitutions and applying the standard integral formula, leading to the Gamma function expression.",
