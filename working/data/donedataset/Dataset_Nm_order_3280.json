    "AcceptedAnswer": "As I explained in my comment, it is enough to do case (2). Let $x,y \\ge 0$. Then $(X+x)(X+x)(X+y) = X^3+(2x+y)X^2 + (x^2+2xy)X + x^2y$.\nThe discriminant of $X^3+bX^2+cX+d$ is, according to wikipedia, $\\Delta(b,c,d) = b^2c^2-4c^3-4b^3d-27d^2+18bcd$. The derivative of $m \\mapsto \\Delta(b^m,c^m,d^m)$ at $m=1$ is \n$$\\delta(b,c,d) \\\\ \n= (2b^2c^2-12b^3d+18bcd)\\log b + (2b^2c^2-12b^3d+18bcd)\\log c + (18bcd-4b^3d-54d^2)\\log d\n$$ Plugging $b = 2x+y,c = x^2+2xy,d = x^2y$ we compute and obtain\n$$ \\delta(x,y) = \n 4x^6(\\frac yx -1)^3\\left(-(2+ \\frac yx)\\log \\frac {(2x+y)^2}{x^2+2xy} + \\frac yx \\log \\frac {(2x+y)^3} {x^2y}\\right)$$ $\\delta(x,y)/4x^6$ is actually a function of $t = \\frac yx$ and has the same sign as $\\delta(x,y)$ so it is enough to study the sign of the function $$g(t) = (t-1)\\left(-(2+t)\\log \\frac{(2+t)^2}{1+2t} + t \\log \\frac {(2+t)^3}t\\right) \\\\\n = (t-1)\\left((t-4)\\log(2+t) + (2+t)\\log(1+2t) - t\\log t\\right)\n$$ Letting $g(t) = (t-1)h(t)$, we compute $h'(t) = \\log(9+(t- t^{-1})^2) + 2\\frac{(t-1)^2}{2t^2+5t+2} \\ge \\log 9 > 0 $. Since $h(1) = -3\\log3+3\\log3-\\log1 = 0$, we have $h(t)>0$ for $t>1$, $h(t)<0$ for $t<1$, and $h(1)=0$. Going back to $g$ we learn that $g(t)>0$ except when $t=1$, which means that $\\delta(x,y) > 0$ except when $x=y$, which is what we wanted.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user's problem is about polynomials. The original problem states:\n\nQuestion 1: Let polynomial $f(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{3}a_{i}x^i$ have three real roots, where $a_{i}>0$, $i=1,2,3$. Show that: $$g(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{3}a^m_{i}x^i$$ has only real roots, where $m\\in \\mathbb{R}$, $m\\ge 1$.\n\nThe user also mentions their attempts with different cases, like when $f(x)$ has a triple root, a double root and a single root, or three distinct roots, but they couldn't prove the latter two cases.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial (since it's degree 3) with three real roots. The coefficients $a_i$ for $i=1,2,3$ are positive. Wait, wait, the user wrote $a_i >0$ for $i=1,2,3$, but the polynomial is from $i=0$ to $3$. So the coefficients are $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$, but the user specifies $a_i >0$ for $i=1,2,3$. However, in standard polynomial notation, $i=0$ would be the constant term. So maybe the user made a typo? Let me check.\n\nLooking back: The user wrote \"f(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{3}a_{i}x^i, have three real numbers roots, where $a_{i}>0,i=1,2,3$\". So the coefficients $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are positive. The constant term is $a_0$, which is not necessarily positive? Wait, but if all the roots are real, and the leading coefficient is $a_3 >0$, then the polynomial tends to $+\\infty$ as $x$ approaches $+\\infty$ and $-\\infty$ as $x$ approaches $-\\infty$ (since it's degree 3). But the roots could be positive or negative. However, the user specifies that $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are positive. The constant term $a_0$ is not mentioned. Wait, that might be an error. Wait, in the case when all roots are real, and the polynomial is written as $f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$, then the coefficients relate to the roots via Vieta's formula. For example, if the roots are $r_1, r_2, r_3$, then:\n\n$f(x) = a_3 (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)$\n\nExpanding this, the coefficients are:\n\n$a_0 = -a_3 r_1 r_2 r_3$\n\n$a_1 = a_3 (r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3)$\n\n$a_2 = -a_3 (r_1 + r_2 + r_3)$\n\n$a_3 = a_3$\n\nGiven that $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are positive, we can derive conditions on the roots. Since $a_3 >0$, then:\n\nFrom $a_2 = -a_3 (sum of roots) >0$, so sum of roots is negative.\n\nFrom $a_1 = a_3 (sum of products of roots two at a time) >0$, so sum of products is positive.\n\nFrom $a_0 = -a_3 (product of roots) >0$ would imply that product of roots is negative. But the user didn't specify $a_0 >0$, only $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$. So maybe $a_0$ can be positive or negative? Wait, but if the polynomial has three real roots, then depending on the roots, $a_0$ could be positive or negative. For example, if there are three negative roots, then product of roots is negative, so $a_0 = -a_3 (product)$ would be positive. If two roots are positive and one negative, then product is positive, so $a_0$ would be negative. But the problem states that the polynomial has three real roots, and $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$. So maybe $a_0$ could be positive or negative? However, the problem statement doesn't specify $a_0 >0$, only $a_1, a_2, a_3$.\n\nBut the user's original problem says \"where $a_i >0$, $i=1,2,3$\". So they are only constraining $a_1, a_2, a_3$ to be positive. So the constant term $a_0$ could be positive or negative. Hmm, but if $a_0$ is not constrained, but the polynomial has three real roots, how does that affect things? For example, if $a_0$ is negative, the polynomial might cross the x-axis three times. But regardless, the problem doesn't specify anything about $a_0$, so maybe that's an oversight? Or maybe the user intended to include $a_0$ as positive? Wait, in their example, when they take $f(x) = (x + p)^3$, then expanding gives $x^3 + 3p x^2 + 3p^2 x + p^3$, so all coefficients $a_0 = p^3$, $a_1 = 3p^2$, $a_2 = 3p$, $a_3 =1$ are positive if $p$ is positive. Similarly, if $f(x) = (x + p)^2 (x + q)$, then expanding would give coefficients where $a_0 = p^2 q$, which is positive if $p, q$ are positive. So perhaps all roots are negative, which would make all coefficients positive. Wait, in Vieta's formula, if all roots are negative, then the coefficients would alternate in sign if the polynomial is written as $(x + r_1)(x + r_2)(x + r_3)$ with $r_i >0$. Wait, no: $(x + r_1)(x + r_2)(x + r_3) = x^3 + (r_1 + r_2 + r_3)x^2 + (r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3)x + r_1 r_2 r_3$, so all coefficients are positive. Therefore, if a cubic polynomial with positive coefficients $a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0$ must have all roots negative real numbers. But the user's problem says that $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$, but $a_0$ is not mentioned. So if $a_0$ is positive, then all roots are negative. If $a_0$ is negative, then there's a mix of roots. However, the problem states that $f(x)$ has three real roots, but without specifying the sign of $a_0$. This might be an inconsistency.\n\nWait, but the problem says that $f(x)$ has three real roots and $a_i >0$ for $i=1,2,3$. So maybe the user intended that all coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ are positive? Because otherwise, if $a_0$ is negative, the polynomial could have three real roots with some positive and some negative. However, in the user's own example, they used polynomials with all coefficients positive, like $(x + p)^3$, which gives all coefficients positive. So maybe the problem actually requires $a_0 >0$ as well? But the original problem statement doesn't mention $a_0 >0$. This is a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"let Polynomial $f(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{3}a_{i}x^i,$ have three real numbers roots,where $a_{i}>0,i=1,2,3$\". So, explicitly, only $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are positive, while $a_0$ is not constrained. However, if $a_0$ is not constrained, then $f(x)$ could have three real roots even with $a_0$ negative. But in the context of the problem, when they take $g(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^3 a_i^m x^i$, they raise each coefficient (including $a_0$) to the power of $m$. So if $a_0$ is negative, then $a_0^m$ would be problematic if $m$ is not an integer, but the problem states $m \\geq 1$ and $m \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So if $a_0$ is negative and $m$ is a real number, say, $m=2$, then $a_0^m$ is positive. But if $m=1.5$, then $a_0^m$ would be taking a root of a negative number, which is not real. But the problem allows $m$ to be any real number greater or equal to 1, so unless $a_0$ is non-negative, raising it to a real power might not be defined. Therefore, perhaps the problem implicitly requires $a_i \\geq 0$ for all $i$, but the user only specified $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$. Wait, but $a_0$ is part of the polynomial $f(x)$, which is given. If $a_0$ is negative, then $a_0^m$ might not be real, unless $m$ is an integer. But the problem states $m \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $m \\geq 1$. Therefore, perhaps the problem actually requires $a_0$ to be positive as well. Otherwise, if $a_0$ is negative, $a_0^m$ may not be real for non-integer $m$, making $g(x)$ have complex coefficients, which complicates the roots being real. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, and all coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ are positive. Alternatively, the user intended that $a_0$ is positive as well. But the original problem states $a_i >0$ for $i=1,2,3$, not including $i=0$. So this is an ambiguity.\n\nGiven that, I need to structure the problem according to the information provided. The original problem states that $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial with three real roots, with coefficients $a_1, a_2, a_3$ positive. The constant term $a_0$ is not mentioned. However, when constructing $g(x)$, we take each coefficient of $f(x)$ (including $a_0$) and raise it to the power $m$. So if $a_0$ is negative, then $a_0^m$ might not be real. Therefore, for $g(x)$ to have real coefficients, $a_0$ must be non-negative. Hence, perhaps the problem implicitly assumes that $a_0$ is positive as well, but this is not stated. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and the user meant to include $a_0$ as positive. Since the user's own example uses $f(x) = (x + p)^3$ which has $a_0 = p^3 >0$, and in the case of $(x + p)^2 (x + q)$, $a_0 = p^2 q >0$ if $p, q >0$, perhaps the problem assumes all coefficients are positive, hence all roots are negative. But the problem as stated doesn't specify $a_0 >0$, so this is a problem.\n\nHowever, the user's original problem says \"where $a_i >0$, $i=1,2,3$\". So in the assumptions, I must list exactly what is given. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^3 a_i x^i$ is a cubic polynomial,\n- $f(x)$ has three real roots,\n- $a_1 >0$,\n- $a_2 >0$,\n- $a_3 >0$,\n- $m$ is a real number,\n- $m \\geq 1$.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"show that $g(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^3 a_i^m x^i$ have only real roots\". Therefore, $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial where each coefficient of $x^i$ is $a_i^m$, with $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$, and $a_0$ could be anything, but in the original $f(x)$, $a_0$ is part of the polynomial with three real roots. However, if $a_0$ in $f(x)$ is negative, then $a_0^m$ may not be real, so for $g(x)$ to be a polynomial with real coefficients, $a_0$ must be non-negative. Therefore, the problem might implicitly assume that $a_0$ is positive. But since the user did not state that, perhaps the correct approach is to include all given assumptions, even if there's a possible inconsistency.\n\nBut according to the example provided in the user's question, when they structured the problem, they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. For example, in the example given, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\".\n\nSo, applying that to the current problem:\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\n- $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial: $f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^3 a_i x^i$\n- $f(x)$ has three real roots\n- $a_i >0$ for $i=1,2,3$\n- $m$ is a real number, $m \\geq 1$\n\nThus, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial with three real roots,\n$a_1 >0$,\n$a_2 >0$,\n$a_3 >0$,\n$m$ is a real number,\n$m \\geq 1$.\n\nBut wait, the first assumption combines two things: that $f$ is cubic and that it has three real roots. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe split into:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial,\n$f(x)$ has three real roots,\n$a_1 >0$,\n$a_2 >0$,\n$a_3 >0$,\n$m$ is a real number,\n$m \\geq 1$.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state that $f(x)$ is cubic; it's implied by the sum from $i=0$ to $3$, so \"cubic polynomial\" is redundant, but maybe necessary. Alternatively, since the user wrote $f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^3 a_i x^i$, which is a cubic polynomial, so it's okay.\n\nSo structured, the assumptions are each a single condition on one object.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial,\n$f(x)$ has three real roots,\n$a_1 > 0$,\n$a_2 > 0$,\n$a_3 > 0$,\n$m$ is a real number,\n$m \\geq 1$.\nProblem:\nShow that $$g(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{3}a^m_{i}x^i$$ has only real roots.\n###\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem has $g(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} a_i^m x^i$, which includes $a_0^m x^0$, so the constant term is $a_0^m$. But in the assumptions, only $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are given as positive. The problem does not specify anything about $a_0$, except that it's part of the original polynomial $f(x)$ which has three real roots. However, in order for $g(x)$ to have real coefficients, $a_0^m$ must be real. Since $m$ is a real number $\\geq 1$, $a_0$ must be non-negative. But in the original problem, $a_0$ could be negative if, for example, the polynomial has roots with both signs. However, given that $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$, using Vieta's formulas as I analyzed earlier, the sum of the roots is negative, the sum of products is positive, and the product of the roots is negative (if $a_0$ is positive, since $a_0 = -a_3 r_1 r_2 r_3$). Wait, if $a_0$ is positive, then $r_1 r_2 r_3$ must be negative, implying an odd number of negative roots. But with the sum of roots negative and sum of products positive, maybe all roots are negative? Let me check.\n\nSuppose all roots are negative: $r_1, r_2, r_3 <0$. Then:\n\nSum of roots: $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -S$, where $S >0$. Then $a_2 = -a_3 (sum) = a_3 S >0$.\n\nSum of products: $r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3 = P$, which is positive because all roots are negative, so each product is positive, sum is positive. So $a_1 = a_3 P >0$.\n\nProduct of roots: $r_1 r_2 r_3 = -Q$, where $Q >0$. Then $a_0 = -a_3 (-Q) = a_3 Q >0$.\n\nThus, if all roots are negative, then all coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ are positive. Conversely, if all coefficients of a cubic polynomial are positive, then Descartes' Rule of Signs says that there are zero positive roots, so all roots must be negative. Therefore, in this case, if $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$, then all roots are negative. However, the original problem states that $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$, but says nothing about $a_0$. So if $a_0$ is positive, then all roots are negative. If $a_0$ is negative, then there must be one negative root and two complex conjugate roots, but the problem states that $f(x)$ has three real roots. Therefore, if $f(x)$ has three real roots and $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$, then $a_0$ must be positive. Because if $a_0$ were negative, then from Vieta's formulas, the product of roots is positive (since $a_0 = -a_3 r_1 r_2 r_3$), so $r_1 r_2 r_3 = -a_0 / a_3$, so if $a_0$ is negative, $r_1 r_2 r_3$ is positive, meaning an even number of negative roots. But the sum of roots is $-a_2 / a_3$ which is negative (since $a_2, a_3 >0$), so sum of roots is negative. If there are two positive roots and one negative root, their sum could be negative. For example, two large negative roots and one small positive root. Wait, no: if product of roots is positive (from $a_0$ negative), then either all roots positive or two negative and one positive. But sum of roots is negative, so two negative and one positive. Let's say roots are $r, s <0$ and $t >0$. Then $r + s + t <0$ implies that $t < -(r + s)$. The product $rst >0$ because two negatives make a positive times positive t. But in this case, $a_1 = a_3(rs + rt + st)$. Since $rs >0$, $rt <0$, $st <0$, so $rs + rt + st$ could be positive or negative. But the problem states $a_1 >0$, so $rs + rt + st >0$. This is possible. For example, take $r = -1$, $s = -1$, $t = 1.5$. Then sum is $-1 -1 +1.5 = -0.5 <0$. Product is (-1)(-1)(1.5)=1.5 >0. Sum of products: (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1.5) + (-1)(1.5) = 1 -1.5 -1.5 = -2 <0. But this would mean $a_1 = a_3*(-2) <0$, contradicting $a_1 >0$. Therefore, such roots cannot exist if $a_1 >0$. Therefore, if $a_0 <0$, then $a_1$ would be negative, which contradicts the given condition $a_1 >0$. Therefore, if $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$ and $f(x)$ has three real roots, then $a_0$ must be positive. Hence, all coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ are positive, and all roots are negative. Therefore, the problem implicitly requires $a_0 >0$, but the user did not state this. However, based on the analysis, $a_0$ must be positive to satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the assumption should include $a_0 >0$ as well. But the original problem does not state this. This is a conflict.\n\nGiven the problem as stated by the user, the assumptions are only on $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$, but mathematically, given that $f(x)$ has three real roots and $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$, $a_0$ must be positive. Therefore, maybe the problem should include $a_0 >0$, but since the user did not, we have to follow their wording. However, in their own example, they use polynomials where $a_0$ is positive. So perhaps it's a typo in the problem statement, and $a_i >0$ for $i=0,1,2,3$. But the user explicitly wrote $i=1,2,3$.\n\nGiven that the problem as stated by the user might have a mistake, but we need to structure it as per the given information. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial (from the sum)\n- $f(x)$ has three real roots\n- $a_1 >0$\n- $a_2 >0$\n- $a_3 >0$\n- $m$ is a real number\n- $m \\geq 1$\n\nEven though $a_0$ is not specified, but given the analysis, maybe $a_0$ must be positive, but since the user didn't state it, we cannot assume it. Therefore, we proceed with the given information.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial,\n$f(x)$ has three real roots,\n$a_1 > 0$,\n$a_2 > 0$,\n$a_3 > 0$,\n$m$ is a real number,\n$m \\geq 1$.\nProblem:\nShow that $$g(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{3}a^m_{i}x^i$$ has only real roots.\n###\n\nBut in this case, $a_0$ is part of the polynomial $f(x)$, and since $f(x)$ has three real roots and $a_1, a_2, a_3 >0$, as shown earlier, $a_0$ must be positive. Therefore, even though the user didn't explicitly state $a_0 >0$, it's a consequence of the other assumptions. Therefore, perhaps it's not necessary to list $a_0 >0$ as an assumption, because it's derived from the given conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem should stick to the user's original assumptions.\n\nAnother thing to check: In the original problem, the user wrote $g(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a^m_{i}x^i$, but in the title, it's \"Polynomial $g(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a^m_{i}x^i$\". However, in the problem statement, it's $g(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{3}a^m_{i}x^i$. So there's a discrepancy between the title and the problem. In the title, it's a general degree $n$ polynomial, but in the problem, it's degree 3. However, the user's example in the question body is about cubic polynomials. So the problem is specifically about cubic polynomials, despite the title mentioning a general polynomial. Therefore, the correct problem is about cubic polynomials.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be as above.",
