    "Content": "Here is a famous problem posed by Ramanujan Show that $$\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5} + \\cdots\\right) + \\left(\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{2}{1+}\\cfrac{3}{1+}\\cfrac{4}{1+\\cdots}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi e}{2}}$$ The first series seems vaguely familiar if we consider the function $$f(x) = x + \\frac{x^{3}}{1\\cdot 3} + \\frac{x^{5}}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5} + \\cdots$$ and note that $$f'(x) = 1 + xf(x)$$ so that $y = f(x)$ satisfies the differential equation $$\\frac{dy}{dx} - xy = 1, y(0) = 0$$ The integrating factor here comes to be $e^{-x^{2}/2}$ so that $$ye^{-x^{2}/2} = \\int_{0}^{x}e^{-t^{2}/2}\\,dt$$ and hence $$f(x) = e^{x^{2}/2}\\int_{0}^{x}e^{-t^{2}/2}\\,dt$$ Thus the sum of the first series is $$f(1) = \\sqrt{e}\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-t^{2}/2}\\,dt$$ But I have no idea about the continued fraction and still more I am not able to figure out how it would simplify to $\\sqrt{\\pi e/2}$ at the end. Please provide any hints or suggestions. Update : We have $$\\begin{aligned}f(1) &= \\sqrt{e}\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-t^{2}/2}\\,dt = \\sqrt{e}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-t^{2}/2}\\,dt - \\sqrt{e}\\int_{1}^{\\infty}e^{-t^{2}/2}\\,dt\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi e}{2}} - \\sqrt{e}\\int_{1}^{\\infty}e^{-t^{2}/2}\\,dt\\end{aligned}$$ and hence we finally need to establish $$\\sqrt{e}\\int_{1}^{\\infty}e^{-t^{2}/2}\\,dt = \\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{2}{1+}\\cfrac{3}{1+}\\cfrac{4}{1+\\cdots}$$ On further searching in Ramanujan's Collected Papers I found the following formula $$\\int_{0}^{a}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} - \\cfrac{e^{-a^{2}}}{2a+}\\cfrac{1}{a+}\\cfrac{2}{2a+}\\cfrac{3}{a+}\\cfrac{4}{2a+\\cdots}$$ and it seems helpful here. But unfortunately proving this formula seems to be another big challenge for me.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a sketch of the proof, the details can be found here . I will offer this sketch because that paper was not intended to prove this result in particular, and I think that a proof might have been written somewhere else. Consider   Mills ratio defined by:\n$$\\varphi(x)=e^{x^2/2}\\int_x^\\infty e^{-t^2/2}dt.$$ Proposition 1. There is a unique sequence of pairs of polynomials $((P_n,Q_n))_n$ such that $$\\varphi^{(n)}(x)=P_n(x)\\varphi(x)-Q_n(x)$$\n  Moreover, these polynomials can be defined inductively by \n  $$P_{n+1}(x)=xP_n(x)+P'_n,\\quad Q_{n+1}=P_n(x)+Q'_n(x)$$\n  with obvious initial conditions. The proof in straightforward by induction. Proposition 2. The sequences $(P_n)_{n}$ and $(Q_n)_{n}$ satisfy the following properties. $(P_0,P_1)=(1,x)$, and for all $n\\geq1$ we have $P_{n+1}=xP_n+nP_{n-1}$. $(Q_0,Q_1)=(0,1)$, and for all $n\\geq1$ we have $Q_{n+1}=xQ_n+nQ_{n-1}$. For all $n\\geq1$ we have $P^\\prime_{n}=nP_{n-1}$. Indeed this follows from Leibniz $n$th derivative formula applied to $\\varphi'(x)=x\\varphi(x)-1$, and the uniqueness statement in Proposition 1. Proposition 3. For all $n\\geq0$, we have $Q_{n+1}P_n-P_{n+1}Q_n=(-1)^nn!$. This also an easy induction. Proposition 4. For all $n\\geq0$, $(-1)^n\\varphi^{(n)}(x)>0$. This is a crucial step. Note that\n$$\\varphi(x)=\\int_0^\\infty e^{-tx}e^{-t^2/2}dt$$\ntherefore\n$$\\varphi^{(n)}(x)=(-1)^n\\int_0^\\infty t^ne^{-tx}e^{-t^2/2}dt$$ Corollary 5. The sequences $(P_n)_{n }$  and $(Q_n)_{n }$ satisfy the following properties. For all $n\\geq0$, and all $x>0$, we have\n  $${Q_{2n}(x)\\over P_{2n}(x)}<\\varphi(x)<{Q_{2n+1}(x)\\over P_{2n+1}(x)}.$$ For all $n\\geq0$, and all $x>0$, we have\n  $$\\left|\\varphi(x)-{Q_n(x)\\over P_n(x)}\\right|<\\frac{n!}{P_n(x)P_{n+1}(x)}.$$ For all  $x>0$, we have\n  $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{Q_n(x)\\over P_n(x)}=\\varphi(x).$$ This last result, and the recurrence relations from Proposition 2. proves that\n$(Q_n/P_n)$ are the convergents of the non regular continued fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{n+1}}{P_{n+1}}=\\cfrac{1}{x+\\cfrac{1}{x+\\cfrac{2}{x+\\cfrac{3}{x+\\cfrac{4}{x+\\cfrac{\\ddots}{n/x}}}}}}\n$$ Finally the desired equality follows from the fact that $\\varphi(1)+f(1)=\\sqrt{\\frac{e\\pi}{2}}$, where $f$ is the function considered by the OP.\nThis concludes the sketch of the proof.$\\qquad\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. The user provided an example, so I need to follow that.\n\nFirst, the original question is about proving an equation given by Ramanujan involving an infinite series and a continued fraction summing up to sqrt(πe/2). The user has some steps already, like defining the function f(x) and solving the differential equation, leading to f(1) being sqrt(e) times the integral from 0 to 1 of e^{-t²/2} dt. Then, they express f(1) as sqrt(πe/2) minus another integral from 1 to infinity. The problem then reduces to showing that this remaining integral equals the continued fraction. The user also found a related formula in Ramanujan's work involving an integral and a continued fraction, which they think is helpful but challenging to prove.\n\nNow, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example shows that each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption is \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted assumption included n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be an error in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Maybe the example was a mistake, but the user wants us to follow their format regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was from another problem where maybe n is required to be divisible by 7? Or perhaps there was a miscommunication. But regardless, the user wants us to list all assumptions in the current problem.\n\nLooking at the current problem: the problem is to show that the sum of the series (1 + 1/(1·3) + 1/(1·3·5) + ...) plus the continued fraction equals sqrt(πe/2). The user's work shows that f(1) is expressed as sqrt(πe/2) minus an integral from 1 to infinity, and they need to show that the continued fraction equals that integral. Then, they mention a formula from Ramanujan's papers involving an integral and a continued fraction, but they find it challenging to prove.\n\nAssumptions: Let's see. The problem is to prove the equation. What are the assumptions here?\n\nLooking at the problem statement:\n\n- The first series is defined as 1 + 1/(1·3) + 1/(1·3·5) + ..., which is the value of f(1) where f(x) is defined as the series x + x³/(1·3) + x⁵/(1·3·5) + ..., which satisfies the differential equation y' - xy =1 with y(0)=0. The user solved this and got f(1) = sqrt(e) ∫₀¹ e^{-t²/2} dt. Then, they expanded this to f(1) = sqrt(πe/2) - sqrt(e) ∫₁^∞ e^{-t²/2} dt. Therefore, to equate the sum of the original series and the continued fraction to sqrt(πe/2), it's required that the continued fraction equals sqrt(e) ∫₁^∞ e^{-t²/2} dt.\n\nThe problem now reduces to proving that the continued fraction (which is the second term in the original equation) equals sqrt(e) times the integral from 1 to infinity of e^{-t²/2} dt.\n\nAdditionally, the user found a formula in Ramanujan's papers: ∫₀^a e^{-x²} dx = sqrt(π)/2 - [e^{-a²}/(2a + 1/(a + 2/(2a + 3/(a + 4/(2a + ... ))))]. They suggest this formula is helpful but challenging to prove.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The function f(x) is defined as x + x³/(1·3) + x⁵/(1·3·5) + ... .\n2. The differential equation dy/dx - xy = 1 with initial condition y(0) = 0 is satisfied by y = f(x).\n3. The solution to the differential equation gives f(1) = sqrt(e) ∫₀¹ e^{-t²/2} dt.\n4. The expression f(1) can be rewritten as sqrt(πe/2) - sqrt(e) ∫₁^∞ e^{-t²/2} dt.\n5. Ramanujan's formula relates the integral of e^{-x²} to a continued fraction.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nWait, maybe the key assumptions here are about the definitions and the relations derived. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the conditions on n. Here, the problem is to prove an equality, so perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the series and continued fraction, and the properties used in the steps, but the user might want us to list the given conditions or premises.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they included assumptions that were part of the problem statement, not derived steps. In their example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, n was any integer, but in the formatted problem, there's an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to have the problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". This is confusing, but perhaps the example is incorrect, but we need to follow the format.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to show that the sum of the two expressions equals sqrt(πe/2). The user has broken it down into showing that the continued fraction equals sqrt(e) ∫₁^∞ e^{-t²/2} dt, and they reference Ramanujan's integral formula.\n\nBut for the assumptions, we need to list the premises given in the problem. The problem states:\n\n- The first series is 1 + 1/(1·3) + 1/(1·3·5) + ..., which is f(1) where f(x) is defined as the series given.\n\n- The continued fraction is [1; 1,1,2,1,3,1,4,...], i.e., the continued fraction with terms 1,1,2,1,3,1,4,...\n\n- The target is to prove their sum is sqrt(πe/2).\n\nBut the problem doesn't state any assumptions beyond the definitions. The user's own steps involve solving the differential equation, but those are part of the solution attempt, not assumptions of the problem.\n\nWait, the problem as posed by Ramanujan is to \"Show that [series] + [continued fraction] = sqrt(πe/2)\". So the assumptions would be the definitions of the series and continued fraction as given, and the problem is to prove their sum equals that constant.\n\nBut according to the example, the user might have included conditions that are part of the problem. For example, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. Similarly, here, the series and continued fraction are defined, but perhaps their convergence or other properties are assumed?\n\nBut the user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. However, in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the assumptions are the conditions on n. But in the current problem, there are no variables; it's a specific equality. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the series and continued fraction, and their convergence.\n\nBut the user's example didn't mention convergence or anything else. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is there an assumption that n is divisible by 7? That must be a mistake. Because the original problem doesn't require n to be divisible by 7; it's for every integer n. Therefore, the example might have an error. But the user wants us to follow the format regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, since it's to prove an equality involving specific mathematical objects (the series and continued fraction), the assumptions would be:\n\n- The first series converges to f(1) as defined.\n\n- The continued fraction converges to the given expression.\n\n- The function f(x) satisfies the differential equation as derived.\n\n- Ramanujan's integral formula holds.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are parts of the problem statement. In the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, so the assumptions were that n is an integer and maybe a condition that was part of the problem. But since the example seems flawed, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should be the definitions and given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the properties that are taken for granted in the problem statement. For example:\n\nAssumption: The infinite series $1 + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5} + \\cdots$ converges.\n\nAssumption: The continued fraction $\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{2}{1+}\\cfrac{3}{1+}\\cfrac{4}{1+\\cdots}$ converges.\n\nProblem: Show that the sum of these two expressions equals $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi e}{2}}$.\n\nBut in the example, they listed assumptions about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), but in this case, there are no variables; it's a specific identity. Therefore, the assumptions might be about the convergence of the series and continued fraction, and any other given definitions.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to \"Show that...\", perhaps the assumptions are the definitions of the series and continued fraction as given.\n\nBut the example's formatting seems to take parts of the original problem's conditions as assumptions. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\". Then, maybe the second assumption in the example was a mistake, or perhaps it's part of another problem.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to list the definitions given in the problem as assumptions. For the current problem:\n\nAssumption: The infinite series is defined as $1 + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5} + \\cdots$.\n\nAssumption: The continued fraction is defined as $\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{2}{1+}\\cfrac{3}{1+}\\cfrac{4}{1+\\cdots}$.\n\nProblem: Show that the sum of these two expressions equals $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi e}{2}}$.\n\nBut the user's own work in the question also mentions the differential equation and the integral expressions. However, those are part of their solution attempt, not the original problem's assumptions. The original problem is just to prove the given equality. Therefore, the assumptions would be the definitions of the series and continued fraction, and the problem is to show their sum equals that value.\n\nBut according to the example, maybe they want more granular assumptions. For instance, in the example, each assumption is one property. So perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\nThe infinite series $1 + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5} + \\cdots$ converges,\nThe continued fraction $\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{2}{1+}\\cfrac{3}{1+}\\cfrac{4}{1+\\cdots}$ converges,\nThe function $f(x) = x + \\frac{x^3}{1\\cdot 3} + \\frac{x^5}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5} + \\cdots$ satisfies the differential equation $\\frac{dy}{dx} - xy = 1$ with $y(0) = 0$,\nThe solution to the differential equation gives $f(1) = \\sqrt{e} \\int_0^1 e^{-t^2/2} dt$,\nRamanujan's formula relates the integral $\\int_0^a e^{-x^2} dx$ to a continued fraction.\n\nBut wait, some of these are part of the user's solution attempt, not the original problem's assumptions. The original problem by Ramanujan is just to show the equality. The user's own steps involve the differential equation and the integral expressions, but those are their approach, not part of the problem's given assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions would only include what is given in the problem statement, not the solution steps. The problem statement defines the two expressions (the series and the continued fraction) and asks to show their sum equals sqrt(πe/2). Therefore, the assumptions are the definitions of those two expressions.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. If that's correct, then perhaps the current problem's assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe infinite series $1 + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5} + \\cdots$ is defined as $f(1)$ where $f(x) = x + \\frac{x^3}{1\\cdot 3} + \\frac{x^5}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5} + \\cdots$,\nThe continued fraction $\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{2}{1+}\\cfrac{3}{1+}\\cfrac{4}{1+\\cdots}$ is defined as given.\n\nProblem: Show that the sum of these two expressions equals $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi e}{2}}$.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The example seems to have included conditions on the variable in the problem, but here there are no variables. The user's own steps involve the differential equation, but that's their work, not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem is just to prove the equality. Therefore, the assumptions should be what is given in the problem statement, which are the definitions of the series and the continued fraction.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes convergence of the series and continued fraction, but that's usually implicit in such problems. However, since the example included explicit assumptions about the variable, perhaps here the assumptions are just the definitions.\n\nSo, to adhere to the example's format, even if it's flawed, I think the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe infinite series is defined as $1 + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5} + \\cdots$,\nThe continued fraction is defined as $\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{1}{1+}\\cfrac{2}{1+}\\cfrac{3}{1+}\\cfrac{4}{1+\\cdots}$.\n\nProblem: Show that their sum equals $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi e}{2}}$.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions for the same object (n). Here, the two expressions are different objects, so each gets its own assumption line.",
