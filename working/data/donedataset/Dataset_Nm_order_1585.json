    "Content": "A topological space is called connected if any presentation of $X$ as $X = V_1 \\uplus V_2$ by disjoint open subsets implies that one of them is trivial ($V_1 = X$ or $V_2 = X$). By taking complement one can replace the word \"open\" by \"close\". A topological space is called irreducible if any presentation of $X$ as $X = X_1 \\cup X_2$ by two closed subsets implies that one of them is trivial ($X_1 = X$ or $X_2 = X$). Clearly every irreducible space is connected. The converse is not always true but: Proposition: Let $X$ be a connected topological space which has an open covering by irreducible subspaces. Then $X$ is irreducible. I want to prove this proposition.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving a proposition in topology: if a connected topological space X has an open covering by irreducible subspaces, then X is irreducible. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The user's example shows that each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's parse the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem mentions a connected topological space X. That's one assumption. Then, it says X has an open covering by irreducible subspaces. So the open covering consists of irreducible subspaces. Each of those subspaces is open and irreducible. But wait, the problem states \"an open covering by irreducible subspaces,\" which means the covering is a collection of open subsets, each of which is irreducible. So each open set in the covering is irreducible. \n\nWait, does the problem say that each open set in the covering is irreducible? Yes. So, the open covering is a family of open subsets of X, each of which is irreducible, and their union is X. So that's another assumption: X is covered by open subsets, each of which is irreducible.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- X is a connected topological space.\n- X has an open covering (a collection of open subsets whose union is X).\n- Each open subset in this covering is irreducible.\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"has an open covering by irreducible subspaces.\" So maybe the open covering's elements are irreducible subspaces. So, each open set in the covering is an irreducible subspace. So each open set in the covering is irreducible (as a subspace). So the user's example had two assumptions: the object (n is an integer) and a condition (n divisible by 7). Here, the object is X, and the conditions are connected, has an open covering, and each open set in the covering is irreducible.\n\nBut wait, the problem states the proposition as: Let X be a connected topological space which has an open covering by irreducible subspaces. Then X is irreducible.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a connected topological space.\n2. X has an open covering (so there exists a collection of open subsets whose union is X).\n3. Each open subset in this covering is irreducible (as a subspace).\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user wrote \"X has an open covering by irreducible subspaces\". So that's the same as saying the covering consists of open subsets, each of which is irreducible. So each element of the open covering is an irreducible subspace. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a connected topological space,\nX has an open covering,\nEach element of the open covering is an irreducible subspace.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"has an open covering by irreducible subspaces\". So maybe that's a single assumption. But according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\n- X is connected.\n- There exists a collection of open subsets {U_i} such that the union of U_i is X.\n- Each U_i is an irreducible subspace.\n\nYes, that's three separate assumptions. However, the original example had two assumptions for the problem: n is integer and n divisible by 7. So maybe here, since the open covering by irreducible subspaces is part of the problem's hypothesis, but that can be split into two: existence of an open covering, and each member is irreducible. But perhaps the user's example prefers each condition as a separate line. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a connected topological space,\nX has an open covering by irreducible subspaces.\n\nWait, but the open covering by irreducible subspaces is a single condition. However, according to the user's example, each assumption should be one property. For instance, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer,\" and the second was \"n is divisible by 7.\" So each is a separate condition. Similarly here, the first assumption is X is connected, the second is X has an open covering (which is a condition), and the third is each open set in the covering is irreducible. But the problem states \"has an open covering by irreducible subspaces\" which combines both the existence of an open covering and that each member is irreducible. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to split that into two assumptions: existence of an open covering, and each member being irreducible. But maybe the original problem's phrasing allows it to be a single assumption. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's proposition is: Let X be a connected topological space which has an open covering by irreducible subspaces. So \"has an open covering by irreducible subspaces\" can be considered a single assumption. But the user's example broke down similar combined conditions. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem split it into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though in the original problem, the assumption was just \"n is an integer\", and the conclusion was that A(n) is divisible by 91. But the user's example added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem. Wait, maybe that was a mistake in the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption is that n is an integer. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not in the original problem. That must be an error in the example. Therefore, maybe the user's example is incorrect, and the correct way is to list all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. That seems wrong. So maybe the user intended to give an example where the problem had an additional condition, but perhaps there was a misunderstanding.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the proposition is: Let X be a connected topological space which has an open covering by irreducible subspaces. Then X is irreducible.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. X is a connected topological space.\n2. X has an open covering (i.e., there exists a family of open subsets {U_i} such that X = union U_i).\n3. Each U_i in the open covering is an irreducible subspace.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement combines 2 and 3 into \"has an open covering by irreducible subspaces\". Therefore, depending on how the user wants to split it. If following the example where the user split \"for every integer n\" into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" (even though the original problem didn't have the divisibility condition), then perhaps here, the user would split \"X has an open covering by irreducible subspaces\" into two separate assumptions: \"X has an open covering\" and \"Each open subset in the covering is irreducible\". But actually, in the problem statement, the open covering is by irreducible subspaces, which is a single condition. So maybe that should be considered as one assumption. However, in the example, the user split \"for every integer n\" into two assumptions, even though in the problem it was just one. So perhaps the user's intention is to split all possible conditions, even if they are part of the same sentence.\n\nBut given that the example may have an error, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as per the problem's original phrasing. In the problem statement, the proposition is: Let X be a connected topological space which has an open covering by irreducible subspaces. So two conditions: connected, and has an open covering by irreducible subspaces. So perhaps the formatted problem's assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a connected topological space,\nX has an open covering by irreducible subspaces.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they split into separate lines for each property. But in this case, \"has an open covering by irreducible subspaces\" is a single condition. Alternatively, if we split into:\n\n1. X is connected.\n2. There exists an open covering of X.\n3. Each open set in the covering is irreducible.\n\nBut the problem states \"open covering by irreducible subspaces\", which implies that the covering is composed of irreducible subspaces. So perhaps the correct way is to list three assumptions: connected, open covering, each open set in covering is irreducible. But maybe the problem's original statement combines 2 and 3 into one condition. This is a bit ambiguous, but given the user's example where they split \"for every integer n\" into two separate assumptions (even though it's one in the problem), perhaps here we should split into two assumptions: connected and open covering by irreducible subspaces. However, the example might have been a mistake. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the user intended to have a problem where the assumption was that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that, leading to confusion.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, but aiming to follow the user's instruction to split each assumption into one line per property, perhaps for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a connected topological space,\nX has an open covering,\nEach open subset in the covering is an irreducible subspace.\n\nProblem: Prove that X is irreducible.\n\nAlternatively, if the open covering by irreducible subspaces is considered a single condition, then:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a connected topological space,\nX has an open covering by irreducible subspaces.\n\nProblem: Prove that X is irreducible.\n\nBut given the user's example split conditions into separate lines, even if they were part of the same original sentence, I think the correct approach here is to list each condition separately. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is connected.\n- X has an open covering (i.e., a family of open subsets whose union is X).\n- Each open subset in this covering is irreducible.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a connected topological space,\nX has an open covering,\nEach open subset in the covering is an irreducible subspace.\nProblem:\nProve that X is irreducible.\n\nBut let me check the original problem's wording again: \"Let X be a connected topological space which has an open covering by irreducible subspaces.\" The phrase \"which has an open covering by irreducible subspaces\" combines both the existence of the open covering and that the subsets in the covering are irreducible. Therefore, perhaps this is a single assumption. However, the user's example suggests splitting even if the original problem combines them. Since the user's example split \"for every integer n\" into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" (even though the original problem didn't have the divisibility), which seems incorrect, perhaps the user intended to list all explicit and implicit assumptions. But in the example, maybe the original problem actually had n being divisible by 7, and the user made a typo. Alternatively, the example might be wrong.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. Given the example's possible error, it's safer to follow the problem's explicit conditions. The proposition starts with \"Let X be a connected topological space which has an open covering by irreducible subspaces.\" So two conditions: connected and open covering by irreducible subspaces. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a connected topological space,\nX has an open covering by irreducible subspaces.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X is irreducible.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they split the original problem's assumptions into separate lines. However, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't have the divisibility condition. That suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, and the user intended to have the formatted assumptions list all conditions from the problem. But in the current problem, the proposition is that X is connected and has an open covering by irreducible subspaces, hence two assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should have two assumptions. Alternatively, if \"open covering by irreducible subspaces\" is considered two separate conditions (existence of open covering and irreducibility of each open set), then three assumptions.\n\nGiven that the problem states \"has an open covering by irreducible subspaces\", which is a standard way to say that the covering exists and each member is irreducible, perhaps it's one assumption. Therefore, I'll go with two assumptions: connected and open covering by irreducible subspaces.",
