    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object per line, and then the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the original problem here: the user is asking to prove an infinite series equals a combination of ζ(3) and ln³2. The problem mentions using the arcsin²z identity and some integration steps. The assumptions would need to list any conditions or properties given in the problem. However, in the original problem statement, there's no explicit mention of assumptions like convergence, specific domains, or constraints on variables. The series is from k=1 to infinity, alternating signs, with terms involving 1/(k³2^k binomial(2k,k)). The answer involves ζ(3) and ln^3 2. \n\nWait, but maybe the key assumptions here are about the convergence of the series, or perhaps the validity of the integration steps? But in the example given earlier, the assumptions were things like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In this current problem, the user hasn't stated any explicit constraints, but perhaps implicit ones. For example, the series converges, or that certain operations like term-wise integration are valid. However, the example provided in the instructions didn't include implicit assumptions like convergence; it included explicit conditions from the problem. Since the original problem here doesn't state any specific conditions (like for which k this holds, but k is a summation index starting from 1), maybe the only assumption is that the series converges. But the example didn't include that either. Wait, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" even though the problem statement said \"for every integer n\". The user included that as an assumption. So perhaps here, since the problem is to prove the equality, the only assumption is that the series converges, but the problem statement itself doesn't state any conditions. Wait, but the series is given as starting at k=1 and going to infinity, so maybe the assumption is that the series converges, but perhaps that's considered part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions here, and the problem is just to prove the identity. \n\nLooking at the example again, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption. In the current problem, the series starts at k=1 and is over all positive integers k. But the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on k, since k is just the index. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions here. Wait, but the example included \"n is an integer\" even though it was stated in the problem. So perhaps here, the assumption is that the summation is over positive integers k from 1 to infinity, but that's inherent in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions to list here. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem as per the format. The example filtered out the original problem's mention of \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption, and added another assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. Wait, wait no, looking back, the original example's problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example had a typo? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless perhaps the example was altered? Hmm, maybe the example was a bad one, but the user provided it. So perhaps in that case, the assumption was incorrect. Wait, but maybe the original problem had a different condition. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the problem from Math Stack Exchange, filter unrelated info, and structure into assumptions and problem. \n\nIn the given problem here, the user is asking to prove the equality of a series to a combination of ζ(3) and ln³2. The question mentions using the arcsin²z identity, but that's part of the user's solution. The original problem statement is: \"How to prove that [series equals expression]?\" There's no explicit conditions given beyond the series definition. So perhaps there are no assumptions beyond the series being defined as starting at k=1 and going to infinity. But maybe the convergence is an implicit assumption, but according to the example, assumptions are properties applied to one object. For example, in the example, n is an integer. Here, maybe the assumption is that k is a positive integer? But since k is the summation index, that's inherent. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions here. But the example included an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps here, we need to list the convergence as an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as given has no assumptions, so the assumption section is empty. But according to the user's example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed. So here, maybe the assumption is that the series converges. But how to phrase that? For example, \"The series converges\", but in the problem, the user is to prove an equality, which would require convergence. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that if the series converges, then it equals that expression. But the problem as stated is to prove the equality, which likely requires knowing that the series converges. However, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", which is part of the problem's premise. \n\nLooking back, the example's formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the divisibility by 7 wasn't part of the original problem. That seems like an error. Perhaps the example was incorrect. But the user might have intended that the formatted problem includes any conditions mentioned in the problem. \n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, since the series is from k=1 to infinity and no conditions are given, the only assumption is that k is a positive integer. But since k is the index variable, that's inherent. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is just the equality. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the original problem's solution, they use integration and certain substitutions, so maybe the assumptions are related to the convergence of the series or the validity of interchanging sum and integral. But the user's example didn't include such mathematical assumptions beyond the variables. \n\nGiven that the example's assumptions were about the variable n (being an integer and divisible by 7), perhaps in the current problem, the only assumption is that k is a positive integer, but that's inherent in the summation. Wait, the problem is about a sum over k from 1 to infinity, so the terms are defined for each positive integer k. So maybe the assumption is that k is a positive integer. But in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", which was stated in the problem. So following that, here, perhaps \"k is a positive integer\" is an assumption. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly state that, but the summation index is k=1 to infinity, implying k is a positive integer. \n\nHowever, the example had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\" and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\". So following that, here, even if the problem's summation is over k starting at 1, we can list \"k is a positive integer\" as an assumption. But maybe it's redundant because the summation notation implies that. However, following the example, it's better to include it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the problem is just the equation. But the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", it's listed as an assumption. So in the current problem, since the summation is over k from 1 to infinity, the assumption is that k is a positive integer. \n\nBut let me check again. The original problem's question is: \"How to prove that $$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^32^k {2k\\choose k}}=\\frac1{4}\\zeta(3)-\\frac1{6}\\ln^32?$$\" So the problem is to prove the equality. The assumptions would be any conditions needed for the equality to hold. Since the user's solution involves integrating from 0 to -1 and using arcsin, maybe the convergence of the series is required, but that's part of the proof. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's inherent in the problem statement. In the example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, which became an assumption. Here, the problem is to evaluate a series, which inherently requires convergence. But perhaps the user expects us to list that the series converges as an assumption. However, in mathematical proofs, often the problem is to show both convergence and the value, but here the problem just states to prove the equality. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where \"n is an integer\" was listed as an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", I think the correct approach here is to list any variables' domains. Here, k is a summation index starting at 1, so k is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumption would be \"k is a positive integer\". But the problem is about the sum over k, so each term is for k ≥ 1, integers. Thus, the assumption is that each term in the series corresponds to k being a positive integer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the problem is simply to prove the equality. But the example required assumptions even when the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So given that, here the assumptions would be:\n\n- The series converges.\n- Each term in the series is defined (i.e., denominators are non-zero).\n\nBut checking the denominators: k^3 is fine for k ≥ 1. 2^k is always non-zero. The binomial coefficient {2k \\choose k} is non-zero for k ≥ 1. So no division by zero issues. Thus, maybe the only assumption is that the series converges. But is that an assumption or part of what needs to be proven? If the problem is to prove the equality, then part of the proof would be to show convergence. However, in some contexts, the problem might assume convergence and just ask for the value. \n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to modify the problem. Given that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, since there are no explicit assumptions given in the problem statement beyond the series definition, the assumptions section is empty. But according to the example, even inherent conditions (like n being an integer) are listed. \n\nGiven this confusion, but aiming to follow the example, perhaps the correct approach is to list the variables' domains. In this case, since the sum is over k from 1 to infinity, we can list:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^32^k {2k\\choose k}}=\\frac1{4}\\zeta(3)-\\frac1{6}\\ln^32.$$\n\nBut wait, the example had multiple assumptions. Here, since the series is infinite, maybe we need to include that the series converges. But the example didn't include convergence assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions here, and the problem is just the equality. However, the example required listing n's properties. Since in this problem, there's no variable like n; the variable k is bound by the summation. Thus, perhaps there are no assumptions to list. But the example had assumptions even for the variable in the problem. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but to adhere to the example's structure, I'll list k as a positive integer as an assumption. Even though it's implied by the summation, following the example where \"n is an integer\" was listed despite being in the problem statement.",
