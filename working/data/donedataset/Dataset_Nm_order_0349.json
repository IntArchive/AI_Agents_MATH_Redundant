    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $S = \\{s_1, \\ldots,s_n\\}$ be a nonempty finite set of size $n > 0$. We will show by induction on $n \\in \\mathbb N$ that there exist some $m,M \\in S$ such that for all $s \\in S$, we have that $m \\leq s \\leq M$. Base Case: For $n=1$, we have $S = \\{s_1\\}$, so taking $m = s_1$ and $M=s_1$ trivially satisfies the required condition. Induction Hypothesis: Assume that the claim holds for $n=k$, where $k \\geq 1$. It remains to prove that the claim holds true for $n = k+1$. To this end, choose any set $S$ with $k+1$ elements, say $S = \\{s_1 ,\\ldots,s_k,s_{k+1}\\}$. Now by the induction hypothesis, the subset:\n$$\nS' = S \\setminus \\{s_{k+1}\\} = \\{s_1 ,\\ldots,s_k\\}\n$$\nhas a minimum element and a maximum element. That is, we know that there exists some $m',M' \\in S'$ such that for all $s' \\in S'$, we have that $m' \\leq s' \\leq M'$. Now observe that $s_{k+1}$ must fall under $1$ of $3$ cases: Case 1: Suppose that $s_{k+1} < m'$. Then take $m = s_{k+1}$ and $M=M'$. To see why this works, observe that any element in $S$ is either $s_{k+1}$ or some $s' \\in S'$, and:\n$$\nm = s_{k+1} < m' \\leq s' \\leq M' =M\n$$ Case 2: Suppose that $m' \\leq s_{k+1} \\leq M'$. Then take $m = m'$ and $M=M'$. To see why this works, observe that any element in $S$ is either $s_{k+1}$ or some $s' \\in S'$, and:\n$$\nm = m' \\leq s_{k+1} \\leq M' = M\n$$\n$$\nm = m' \\leq s' \\leq M' = M\n$$ Case 3: Suppose that $s_{k+1} > M'$. Then take $m =m'$ and $M=s_{k+1}$. To see why this works, observe that any element in $S$ is either $s_{k+1}$ or some $s' \\in S'$, and:\n$$\nm = m' \\leq s' \\leq M' < s_{k+1} = M\n$$ Hence, we have shown that $S$ has a minimum and maximum element, as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that a finite set always has a maximum and a minimum. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that the set is finite. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were more specific, like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" Here, the main assumption is that the set is finite. But wait, is there more? The example had two assumptions even though the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n.\" Maybe the example split the conditions into separate assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumption is that the set is finite. But maybe there's another implicit assumption. For instance, the set must be non-empty because an empty set doesn't have a maximum or minimum. The original question didn't mention non-emptiness, but in mathematics, the maximum and minimum are defined for non-empty sets. So, perhaps the user needs to list that as an assumption.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n1. The set is finite.\n2. The set is non-empty.\n\nEach assumption should address one property applied to one object. Here, the object is the set. The first property is finiteness, and the second is non-emptiness. \n\nThe problem then is to prove that this set has both a maximum and a minimum. \n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, is the set ordered? Well, maximum and minimum are defined in ordered sets. Typically, in math problems like this, we're dealing with real numbers or some totally ordered set. But the original problem doesn't specify. However, since the user is talking about a general finite set, maybe we need to assume it's a subset of a totally ordered set, like the real numbers. But the original question didn't mention that. \n\nWait, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the problem is about a set. The user's example didn't include the ordering as an assumption, probably because it's implied in the context of divisibility. Similarly, here, the context of maximum and minimum implies an ordered set. So maybe the assumption should include that the set is a subset of a totally ordered set. But the original problem statement didn't mention that. The original question just says \"a finite set always has a maximum and a minimum.\" \n\nHmm. In standard math, maximum and minimum require an order. So if the set is just any finite set without an order, the terms max and min don't apply. So perhaps the assumption is that the set is a subset of a totally ordered space, like real numbers. But since the original problem didn't specify, maybe the user expects that as part of the assumptions. However, in the example provided, the user didn't include that. For instance, in the example, the problem was about divisibility, which is in integers, but the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, maybe the order is part of the problem's context, and the user expects to list only the explicit assumptions given in the problem. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"a finite set always has a maximum and a minimum.\" The user is structuring this problem. The original question on Math Stack Exchange probably assumes that the set is a subset of real numbers or some ordered set. But in the problem statement, there's no mention of the set being ordered. So perhaps the problem is in the context of real numbers. However, the user's example didn't include the real numbers as an assumption; it just listed the properties of n. So maybe here, the key assumptions are that the set is finite and non-empty, as without non-emptiness, there's no max or min. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n- The set is finite.\n- The set is non-empty.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the set has both a maximum and a minimum. \n\nI think that's correct. Even though the order is necessary, in the context of the problem, it's assumed that the set is ordered (like real numbers), but since the original problem didn't mention it, maybe the user doesn't need to list it as an assumption. The example given by the user also didn't include the ambient space (like integers), but listed properties of the variable. So following that pattern, the assumptions here are just finiteness and non-emptiness. But wait, the original problem statement didn't mention non-emptiness. The user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original example was: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example was wrong? Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That changes the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect. But the user provided that example. So perhaps in their formatting, they want to list even the implicit assumptions. But in that case, the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption should be that n is an integer. The example adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem, which suggests maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, following the user's example, they split the problem's conditions into assumptions. So for the current problem, even if the original statement is \"A finite set always has a maximum and a minimum,\" the assumptions should list the necessary conditions.\n\nIn standard math, to have a maximum and minimum, the set must be non-empty and finite, and ordered. But the original problem didn't mention non-emptiness. So perhaps the user's answer should include the non-emptiness as an assumption, even if the original problem didn't state it. Because otherwise, an empty set is finite but has no max or min. Therefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: The set is finite.\n\nAssumption: The set is non-empty.\n\nProblem: Prove that the set has a maximum and a minimum.\n\nSo even though the original problem says \"always,\" which might imply considering all finite sets, including empty ones, but since the empty set doesn't have max or min, the problem must be considering non-empty finite sets. Therefore, the user should include non-emptiness as an assumption. Thus, the formatted problem should list both.",
