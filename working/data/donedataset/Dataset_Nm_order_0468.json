    "Content": "Recall that a compact Hausdorff space is second countable if and only if the Banach space $C(X)$ of continuous functions on $X$ is separable.  I'm looking for a similar criterion for locally compact Hausdorff spaces, using $C_0(X)$ (the Banach space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity) instead of $C(X)$. Naive Guess: Suppose $X$ is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space.  Then $C_0(X)$ is separable. Proposed Proof: Since $X$ is second countable, so is its one-point compactification $\\tilde{X}$.  By the theorem above $C(\\tilde{X})$ is is separable, and thus $C_0(X)$ is separable since subspaces of separable metric spaces are separable (not true for subspaces of arbitrary separable spaces, but OK for separable metric spaces).  QED. Problem: I'm not sure if the first line is true.  This seems to be equivalent to the statement that every second countable locally compact Hausdorff space is the countable union of compact subspaces, and I can't find a proof or a counter-example.  If this turns out to be false, what IS the right criterion for $C_0(X)$ to be separable?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your argument is correct, thanks to the following result. Theorem. For a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ the following are equivalent: $X$ is Lindelöf. $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact. There is a sequence $\\langle K_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\rangle$ of compact subspaces of $X$ such that $K_n\\subseteq\\operatorname{int}K_{n+1}$ for each $n\\in\\Bbb N$ and $X=\\bigcup_{n\\in\\Bbb N}K_n$. The point at infinity in the one-point compactification of $X$ has a countable local base. Proof. Suppose that $X$ is Lindelöf. For each $x\\in X$ let $U_x$ be an open nbhd of $x$ with compact closure, and let $\\mathscr{U}=\\{U_x:x\\in X\\}$. $\\mathscr{U}$ is an open cover of $X$, so it has a countable subcover $\\{V_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\}$. Clearly $X=\\bigcup_{n\\in\\Bbb N}\\operatorname{cl}V_n$ is a representation of $X$ as a countable union of compact sets, so $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact. Now assume that $X$ is $\\sigma$-compact, and let $\\{C_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\}$ be a countable cover of $X$ by compact sets. Let $K_0=C_0$. If the compact set $K_n$ has already been defined, for each $x\\in K_n$ let $U_x$ be an open nbhd of $x$ with compact closure, and let $\\mathscr{U}=\\{U_x:x\\in K_n\\}$. $K_n$ is compact, so $\\mathscr{U}$ has a finite subcover $\\{V_1,\\dots,V_m\\}$. Let $K_{n+1}=C_n\\cup\\bigcup_{k=1}^m\\operatorname{cl}V_k$; then $K_{n+1}$ is compact, and $K_n\\subseteq\\operatorname{int}K_{n+1}$. Finally, $C_n\\subseteq K_n$ for $n\\in\\Bbb N$, so $\\bigcup_{n\\in\\Bbb N}K_n=X$. Now assume that there is a sequence $\\langle K_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\rangle$ as in (3). Let $X^*$ be the one-point compactification of $X$, and let $p$ be the point at infinity. For $n\\in\\Bbb N$ let $B_n=X^*\\setminus K_n$, and let $\\mathscr{B}=\\{B_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\}$; then $\\mathscr{B}$ is a countable local base at $p$. To see this, let $U$ be any open nbhd of $p$ in $X^*$. Then $C=X^*\\setminus U$ is a compact subset of $X$. $\\bigcup_{n\\in\\Bbb N}\\operatorname{int}K_n=X$, so $\\{\\operatorname{int}K_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\}$ is an increasing open cover of $C$, and therefore there is an $n\\in\\Bbb N$ such that $C\\subseteq\\operatorname{int}K_n\\subseteq K_n$, whence $B_n\\subseteq U$. Finally, suppose that $X^*$ is first countable at $p$, the point at infinity, and let $\\mathscr{B}=\\{B_n:n\\in\\Bbb N\\}$ be a nested local base at $p$. For $n\\in\\Bbb N$ let $K_n=X^*\\setminus B_n$; then each $K_n$ is compact, and $X=\\bigcup_{n\\in\\Bbb N}K_n$. Let $\\mathscr{U}$ be an open cover of $X$. For each $n\\in\\Bbb N$ let $\\mathscr{U}_n$ be a finite subset of $\\mathscr{U}$ covering the compact set $K_n$, and let $\\mathscr{V}=\\bigcup_{n\\in\\Bbb N}\\mathscr{U}_n$; then $\\mathscr{V}$ is a countable subcover of $\\mathscr{U}$. $\\dashv$ Of course a second countable space is Lindelöf, so you get all of (1)-(4).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about when the space C_0(X) is separable, where X is a locally compact Hausdorff space. They mention that for compact Hausdorff spaces, second countability of X is equivalent to C(X) being separable. Now they want a similar criterion for C_0(X) when X is locally compact.\n\nTheir naive guess is that if X is second countable and locally compact Hausdorff, then C_0(X) is separable. They propose a proof that involves the one-point compactification of X, denoted as Ỹ. They say that if X is second countable, then Ỹ would also be second countable, and since Ỹ is compact Hausdorff, C(Ỹ) would be separable. Then they argue that C_0(X) is a subspace of C(Ỹ), and since subspaces of separable metric spaces are separable, C_0(X) would be separable.\n\nHowever, the user is unsure if the first line is true. They think this is equivalent to X being a countable union of compact subspaces. They couldn't find a proof or counter-example, so they want to know if their initial assumption is false and what the correct criterion is.\n\nSo, the problem here is twofold: first, verifying whether second countable locally compact Hausdorff spaces imply that C_0(X) is separable via their proposed method, and second, if that's not valid, determining the correct condition for C_0(X)'s separability.\n\nNow, breaking down the assumptions. The original setup is about a locally compact Hausdorff space X. The user assumes X is second countable, which is part of their proposed criterion. The proposed proof relies on the one-point compactification Ỹ being second countable, which they might be taking for granted if X is second countable and locally compact. However, they are questioning this step, wondering if it's equivalent to X being a countable union of compact subspaces. \n\nSo, the key assumptions here would be:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n- X is second countable.\n- The one-point compactification Ỹ of X is second countable.\n- C_0(X) is a subspace of C(Ỹ).\n- Subspaces of separable metric spaces are separable.\n\nBut the user is specifically doubting the implication that if X is second countable and locally compact, then Ỹ is second countable. They also mention that this might be equivalent to X being σ-compact (countable union of compact subsets). So, perhaps the core issue is whether second countable locally compact Hausdorff spaces are σ-compact, and if that's necessary for Ỹ to be second countable.\n\nIn their problem statement, they want to confirm if their initial assumption (second countable locally compact Hausdorff implies C_0(X) separable) is correct, or if σ-compactness is required instead. If their assumption is wrong, they want the correct criterion.\n\nSo, structuring this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a locally compact Hausdorff space,\nX is second countable,\nỸ is the one-point compactification of X,\nỸ is second countable,\nC_0(X) is a subspace of C(Ỹ),\nSubspaces of separable metric spaces are separable.\n\nBut wait, the user is questioning whether X being second countable implies Ỹ is second countable. So perhaps the assumption they are making (which they are unsure of) is that X's second countability implies Ỹ's second countability. But in reality, maybe this isn't automatically true. Alternatively, the actual condition might require X to be σ-compact. So, the problem they're posing is whether their initial approach is valid, and if not, what's the right condition.\n\nBut according to the user's original problem statement, the problem is: If X is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space, is C_0(X) separable? The user's proposed proof hinges on Ỹ being second countable. However, they are unsure if this holds, and they think it's equivalent to X being σ-compact. They seek either a counter-example or a proof, and if false, the correct criterion.\n\nTherefore, the problem as per the user's question is: Determine whether every second countable locally compact Hausdorff space X implies that C_0(X) is separable, particularly addressing the validity of the proposed proof's step regarding the second countability of Ỹ and its relation to X being σ-compact. If this is false, find the correct criterion.\n\nSo, translating this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions (the key ones from the problem as posed):\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space,\n- X is second countable,\n- The one-point compactification Ỹ of X is second countable,\n- C_0(X) is a subspace of the separable Banach space C(Ỹ).\n\nBut the user is not sure about the first line (presumably the assumption that X being second countable implies Ỹ is second countable). So, perhaps the assumptions to list are the ones the user is making in their proposed proof, which they are questioning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nProblem: Is it true that if X is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space, then C_0(X) is separable? The proposed proof relies on Ỹ being second countable. If not, what is the correct criterion for C_0(X) to be separable?\n\nSo, the problem statement should capture the user's question. They are asking two things: 1) whether their initial guess is correct (and thus whether their proof works), and 2) if not, what the right criterion is.\n\nBut according to the example given in the original user's instruction, the formatted problem should list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement.\n\nIn the original problem example, the user had a problem where an assumption was incorrect (the divisibility by 7 was not in the original problem, but the formatted version included it). Wait, no, the example shows that in the original problem, the user had to structure the problem, but in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for all integers n, but in the formatted version, an assumption was added (n divisible by 7). But that seems to be an error. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but 91 is 7*13. So the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted version, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made an error in their example. Hmm. But perhaps in the example, they intended to restructure the problem but mistakenly added an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption, but I think in the example, the user is showing how they structured the problem, perhaps the original problem had a typo or an omitted condition.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's instruction: when structuring the problem, filter the unrelated information and list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions from the user's proposed proof and question are:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\n- The one-point compactification Ỹ of X is second countable.\n\nBut the user is questioning the third assumption. So, in the problem, they are trying to see if X being second countable and locally compact Hausdorff implies Ỹ is second countable, which they think is equivalent to X being σ-compact. Then, if that's not the case, what is the correct condition.\n\nTherefore, the problem is: Determine whether the statement \"If X is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space, then C_0(X) is separable\" is true, particularly addressing the validity of the implication that the one-point compactification Ỹ is second countable. If this is false, find the correct criterion for separability of C_0(X).\n\nBut to structure this into the given format, we need to list the assumptions. The user's problem is based on:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\n- The one-point compactification Ỹ of X is second countable (the user is unsure about this).\n\n- Subspaces of separable metric spaces are separable.\n\nProblem: Determine whether C_0(X) is separable under these assumptions, particularly verifying the validity of the implication that Ỹ is second countable when X is second countable and locally compact Hausdorff. If false, provide the correct criterion for C_0(X) to be separable.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement can be simplified as the user originally asked: They proposed a proof that if X is second countable and locally compact Hausdorff, then C_0(X) is separable, but they are unsure if a key step (Ỹ being second countable) holds. They also relate this to X being σ-compact. The problem is then twofold: verify the proposed proof's validity (i.e., is Ỹ second countable when X is second countable and locally compact Hausdorff?) and if not, find the correct criterion.\n\nHowever, the user's exact problem statement at the end is: \"If this turns out to be false, what IS the right criterion for $C_0(X)$ to be separable?\"\n\nSo, combining this, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as given in the problem, then the problem is to check the validity of the proposed proof (i.e., whether X being second countable locally compact Hausdorff implies C_0(X) is separable via the given argument), and if not, find the correct criterion.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem should have all assumptions listed line by line, each being a single property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\n- The one-point compactification of X, denoted Ỹ, is second countable.\n\n- C_0(X) is a subspace of C(Ỹ).\n\n- Subspaces of separable metric spaces are separable.\n\nProblem: Determine whether C_0(X) is separable under these assumptions. If the assumption that Ỹ is second countable is false, provide the correct criterion for separability of C_0(X).\n\nBut the user is questioning the assumption that Ỹ is second countable. However, in the problem as posed, the user is not sure if the first line (presumably of their proposed proof) is true. The first line of the proposed proof is: \"Since X is second countable, so is its one-point compactification Ỹ.\" So, the key assumption being questioned is whether X being second countable and locally compact Hausdorff implies that Ỹ is second countable.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that needs to be listed is that X is second countable, and the implication is that Ỹ is second countable. However, since the user is challenging this, perhaps the formatted problem should present the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\nProblem: Is the one-point compactification Ỹ of X necessarily second countable? If so, then prove that C_0(X) is separable. If not, provide the correct criterion for C_0(X) to be separable.\n\nBut the user's main problem is the separability of C_0(X), so the problem is: Determine whether C_0(X) is separable when X is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space, addressing the validity of the proposed proof. If the proof fails due to Ỹ not being second countable, state the correct criterion for separability.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the problem is structured as listing the assumptions (including any that might have been incorrect or added) and then the problem. So in this case, the user's original problem has:\n\nOriginal problem components:\n\n- X is locally compact Hausdorff.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\n- Proposed that Ỹ is second countable (from X being second countable).\n\n- Then C_0(X) is separable.\n\nBut the user is doubting the step that Ỹ is second countable. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem are:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\n- The one-point compactification Ỹ of X is second countable.\n\n- C_0(X) is a subspace of C(Ỹ).\n\n- Subspaces of separable metric spaces are separable.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that C_0(X) is separable. If the assumption that Ỹ is second countable is false, provide the correct criterion for separability of C_0(X).\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to state the problem as the user posed it: they proposed a proof under certain assumptions, which they are now questioning. So the assumptions are those in their proposed proof, and the problem is whether the conclusion holds.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's main question is: \"If X is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space, is C_0(X) separable?\" and they are unsure about the step involving Ỹ's second countability, which they relate to X being σ-compact. Thus, the formatted problem should capture the original question's assumptions and the problem.\n\nHence:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\nProblem: Determine whether C_0(X) is separable. Specifically, verify if the one-point compactification Ỹ of X is second countable, and whether this leads to C_0(X) being separable. If not, provide the correct criterion for separability of C_0(X).\n\nBut per the example given, the problem should list the assumptions (those given in the problem, not the proposed proof's assumptions). Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That suggests that maybe in the example, the user corrected the problem by adding a missing assumption. But perhaps in the current problem, we need to structure the original question's assumptions.\n\nLooking back, the user's original question on Math SE is: \"When is C_0(X) separable? [...] Naive Guess: Suppose X is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space. Then C_0(X) is separable. [...] Problem: I'm not sure if the first line is true. [...] If this turns out to be false, what IS the right criterion for C_0(X) to be separable?\"\n\nTherefore, the original problem's assumptions for the Naive Guess are:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\nThe problem is to determine whether C_0(X) is separable under these assumptions. The user's proposed proof relies on Ỹ being second countable, which they are unsure of. They also mention that this might relate to X being σ-compact.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as per the Naive Guess, and the problem is to determine if C_0(X) is separable under those assumptions, and if not, provide the correct criterion.\n\nSo, following the example's structure:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\nProblem: Determine whether C_0(X) is separable. If not, provide the correct criterion for C_0(X) to be separable.\n\nBut wait, the example included an incorrect assumption (adding divisibility by 7). However, in this case, the assumptions are as per the user's Naive Guess. The user's problem is whether their Naive Guess is correct. The Naive Guess assumes X is second countable and locally compact Hausdorff, and claims C_0(X) is separable. The user is unsure, so the formatted problem should list those assumptions and ask to prove or disprove the separability.\n\nHence:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- X is second countable.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that C_0(X) is separable. If the statement is false, provide the correct criterion for C_0(X) to be separable.\n\nBut the user's proposed proof hinges on Ỹ being second countable, which they are unsure of. However, the problem as posed by the user is to verify the validity of their Naive Guess and, if incorrect, find the right criterion. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions of the Naive Guess and pose the problem as proving/disproving it, and finding the correct criterion if needed.\n\nThus, the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a locally compact Hausdorff space,\nX is second countable.\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $C_0(X)$ is separable. If false, provide the correct criterion for $C_0(X)$ to be separable.",
