I can solve the problem in the case $m=1$. To see this, note that the result is obvious if the first partial derivative $D_1 f(x)=0$ for all $x$ as then $f$ will be independent of the first variable. Otherwise there exists $a\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ s.t. $D_1 f(a)\\not=0$. Put $g:A\\to \\mathbb{R}^n, g(x)=(f(x),x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$ (with $x=(x_1,\\ldots, x_n)$). Now the Jacobian \n$$ \ng'(x) = \\left[\n          \\begin{array}{cc}\n             D_1 f(x) & 0 \\\\\n             0        & I_{n-1}     \n          \\end{array}\n        \\right]\n$$ \nso that $\\text{det}\\, g'(a)=D_1 f(a)\\not=0$. By the Inverse Function Theorem we have an open set $B\\subseteq A$ s.t. $g:B\\to g(B)$ is bijective with a differentiable inverse. In particular, $g(B)$ is open.

Thus we can find $b'\\in B$ s.t. $g(b')=(f(b), b_2, \\ldots, b_n+\\varepsilon)$. By the definition of $g$, $f(b')=f(b)$ with $b'$ and $b$ differing in the last coordinate. Thus $f$ isn't injective.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $k\\leq m$ be the maximum rank of $f'(x)$ when $x$ runs through $\\mathbb R^n$ and $a\\in \\mathbb R^n$ be a point where the maximum is attained: $rank(f'(a))=k$ . We will have $rank(f'(u))=k$ for all $u$ in some open neighbourhood $U$ of $a$ [obtained by  choosing a non-zero $k\\times k$ minor of $f'(a)$ ]. The constant rank theorem will then assure us that locally near $a$ the map $f$ looks like $  (x_1,...,x_n) \\mapsto  (x_1,...,x_k,0,...,0)$ and is thus not injective since $n\\gt k$ (because $n\\gt m\\geq k$ ) Edit Here is a 13-line proof of the constant rank theorem, written by a high-quality contributor to this site: @Pierre-Yves Gaillard",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about showing that a continuously differentiable function from R^n to R^m can't be injective when n > m. The user already solved the case when m=1 but is stuck on higher dimensions. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some relevant theorems. The Inverse Function Theorem comes to mind, which the user used for the m=1 case. For higher dimensions, maybe the Constant Rank Theorem or the Implicit Function Theorem could be useful. Also, Sard's Theorem might be related, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nIn the example given for m=1, they constructed a function g that included f(x) as the first component and the other coordinates. The Jacobian determinant of g was non-zero, allowing the use of the Inverse Function Theorem. Then, by finding points in the image that differ only in the last coordinate but have the same f value, they showed f isn't injective.\n\nFor higher dimensions, maybe we can use a similar approach. Suppose n > m. Let's consider a function f: R^n → R^m that's C¹. We need to show f can't be injective. If we can find two distinct points in R^n that map to the same point in R^m, that would do it.\n\nThinking about the derivative Df(x). Since Df(x) is a linear map from R^n to R^m, its rank is at most m. Because n > m, the rank is less than the dimension of the domain, so the kernel of Df(x) is non-trivial by the Rank-Nullity Theorem. But how does that help with injectivity?\n\nWait, injectivity of f would require that the derivative is injective, but if the derivative has a non-trivial kernel, then f can't be an immersion. However, even if the derivative isn't injective everywhere, f could still be injective. So that might not directly give the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the idea of the user's approach but in higher dimensions. Suppose we pick a point a where the derivative Df(a) has maximal rank m. Then, the image of a neighborhood around a under f would look like an m-dimensional manifold. But since the domain is higher dimensional, maybe there's a way to show that f must identify points in that neighborhood.\n\nWait, if the derivative has rank m at some point, then by the Constant Rank Theorem, f can be locally expressed as a linear projection followed by a diffeomorphism. But how does that help? If we have a submersion, then the fibers are (n - m)-dimensional, which are positive since n > m. So each fiber has infinitely many points, which would mean f is not injective. But this requires that the derivative has rank m somewhere. If the derivative never has rank m, then f is not even a submersion or immersion, so maybe in that case, f is constant on some lines or something, leading to non-injectivity.\n\nBut the problem states that f is continuously differentiable, so maybe we can use the fact that either the derivative has maximal rank m somewhere or it doesn't. If it does, then as above, we can apply the Constant Rank Theorem and find that the function isn't injective. If it doesn't, then the function is somehow degenerate, and maybe we can apply the argument similar to the m=1 case where a partial derivative is zero, leading to dependence on fewer variables.\n\nWait, in the m=1 case, the user considered whether the first partial derivative is zero everywhere or not. If it's zero everywhere, then f doesn't depend on the first variable, hence not injective. If it's non-zero somewhere, then construct g and use the Inverse Function Theorem. For higher m, perhaps we need to check the rank of the derivative.\n\nSuppose that Df(x) has rank less than m everywhere. Then, by Sard's Theorem, the image has measure zero, but that doesn't necessarily contradict injectivity. However, if Df(x) has rank m at some point, then in a neighborhood of that point, the function is a submersion, so the preimages of points near f(a) are (n - m)-dimensional submanifolds, which would contain infinitely many points, hence f can't be injective.\n\nTherefore, the argument would split into two cases: either the derivative has maximal rank m somewhere, leading to non-injectivity via the Constant Rank Theorem, or it doesn't, in which case the function is not injective because it's \"degenerate\" in some way, perhaps by being constant along certain directions.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Let's try to outline the steps.\n\nCase 1: There exists a point a where the rank of Df(a) is m. Then, by the Constant Rank Theorem, there are neighborhoods U of a and V of f(a), and diffeomorphisms φ: U → φ(U) ⊂ R^n and ψ: V → ψ(V) ⊂ R^m such that ψ ◦ f ◦ φ⁻¹ is the projection map (x₁,...,x_n) ↦ (x₁,...,x_m). But since n > m, the projection is not injective (as different points with the same first m coordinates but different others project to the same point). Therefore, f would not be injective on U.\n\nCase 2: The rank of Df(x) is less than m for all x. Then, the image of f is a set of measure zero in R^m (by Sard's Theorem), but since R^m is connected and f is continuous, the image should be connected. However, a measure zero set in R^m can't contain an open set, so the image isn't open. But how does that help with injectivity? Maybe in this case, the function is not injective because it's \"too degenerate\". For example, if all partial derivatives are zero in some direction, then f is constant along that direction, hence not injective.\n\nWait, if the derivative Df(x) has rank less than m everywhere, then for each x, there's a non-trivial linear dependence among the rows of the derivative matrix. That means there's some direction in the domain R^n where the directional derivative is zero. However, integrating this might imply that f is constant along certain curves, leading to non-injectivity.\n\nBut how to make this precise? Suppose that for each x, there exists a non-zero vector v_x in R^n such that Df(x)(v_x) = 0. Then, if we can find a curve whose tangent vectors are these v_x, along which f is constant, then f would not be injective. But integrating these vectors into a curve requires solving a differential equation, and since the vector fields v_x might vary with x, this could be non-trivial. However, if we can find a single direction where the derivative is zero everywhere, then f would be constant along that direction, hence not injective.\n\nBut the problem is that the direction v_x could vary from point to point. However, in the case where the derivative has constant rank, there's a theorem about integrability (Frobenius), but this might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the kernel of Df(x) has dimension at least n - m. Since n > m, this is at least 1. Therefore, the kernel is a distribution of dimension at least 1. If this distribution is integrable, then we have integral submanifolds, and f is constant along these submanifolds, hence not injective.\n\nBut all of this seems a bit advanced. Maybe there's a simpler approach using the Inverse Function Theorem directly, similar to the m=1 case.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the idea from the m=1 case but for higher m. Suppose we have f: R^n → R^m with n > m. Assume f is injective and C¹. Then, pick a point a where the derivative Df(a) has maximal rank (which is m). Then, the image of a neighborhood around a would be an m-dimensional submanifold. However, since f is injective, the inverse function should exist locally, but the problem is that the domain is higher dimensional. Wait, but the Inverse Function Theorem requires the derivative to be square and invertible. So, maybe instead, use the fact that the derivative has rank m, so we can find m coordinates in R^n such that the derivative with respect to those coordinates is invertible. Then, apply the Implicit Function Theorem to express the remaining n - m coordinates as functions of these m coordinates. Then, varying those n - m coordinates while keeping the m coordinates fixed would not change the value of f, implying that f is not injective.\n\nYes, that sounds promising. Let's formalize that.\n\nAssume that Df(a) has rank m. Then, there exists a subset of m coordinates in R^n such that the corresponding m x m minor of Df(a) is non-zero. Without loss of generality, suppose the first m coordinates are such that the matrix [D_j f_i(a)] for i,j=1,...,m is invertible. Then, by the Implicit Function Theorem, we can solve for x₁,...,x_m in terms of f and the remaining variables x_{m+1},...,x_n. Wait, no, the Implicit Function Theorem would allow us to express m variables in terms of the others. Alternatively, consider the function F: R^n → R^m × R^{n - m} defined by F(x) = (f(x), x_{m+1}, ..., x_n). Then, the derivative DF(a) would be a block matrix:\n\n[ Df(a) ]\n[  0    | I_{n - m} ]\n\nBut Df(a) has rank m, and the identity matrix is in the lower block. Wait, but Df(a) is m x n. If we pick the first m columns to be invertible, then the Jacobian matrix of F with respect to the first m variables and the last n - m variables would be:\n\n[ A | B ]\n[ 0 | I ]\n\nwhere A is the invertible m x m matrix, B is m x (n - m), and I is the (n - m) x (n - m) identity matrix. The determinant of this block matrix is det(A) * det(I) = det(A) ≠ 0. Therefore, by the Inverse Function Theorem, F is a local diffeomorphism at a. Therefore, there exists an open neighborhood U of a such that F is a diffeomorphism from U to F(U). Now, consider points in U that differ only in the last n - m coordinates. Since F preserves those coordinates, two such points would map to different points in F(U). However, if we look at f(x), since F(x) includes f(x) as the first m components, varying the last n - m coordinates would require f(x) to adjust accordingly to maintain the diffeomorphism. Wait, maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, since F is a local diffeomorphism, for any point in F(U), we can vary the last n - m coordinates freely while keeping the first m coordinates (which are f(x)) fixed. But since F is injective on U, that would mean that for a fixed value of f(x), there's only one corresponding x in U. However, this contradicts the idea that we can vary the last n - m coordinates. Hmm, maybe I confused the construction.\n\nWait, let's think again. If F(x) = (f(x), x_{m+1}, ..., x_n), then F maps x to (f(x), x_{m+1}, ..., x_n). The derivative DF(a) is as above, with the top block being Df(a) and the bottom block being [0 | I]. If Df(a) has rank m, then the Jacobian matrix DF(a) has full rank n, since the bottom block adds n - m dimensions. Therefore, F is a local diffeomorphism. So, F(U) is open in R^n, and F is invertible there.\n\nNow, take a point b in U. Then F(b) = (f(b), b_{m+1}, ..., b_n). Since F(U) is open, there exists ε > 0 such that (f(b), b_{m+1} + ε, ..., b_n) is in F(U). Therefore, there exists a point b' in U such that F(b') = (f(b), b_{m+1} + ε, ..., b_n). But by the definition of F, this means f(b') = f(b), and the last n - m coordinates of b' are b_{m+1} + ε, ..., b_n. Therefore, b' differs from b only in the last n - m coordinates, but f(b') = f(b), contradicting the injectivity of f.\n\nThis seems to work! Just like in the m=1 case, but extended by considering the function F that appends the extra coordinates. Then, using the Inverse Function Theorem to show that we can vary those coordinates while keeping f(x) constant, leading to a contradiction if f were injective.\n\nTherefore, the general argument would be:\n\nAssume f: R^n → R^m is C¹ and injective, with n > m. Then, at some point a, the derivative Df(a) must have rank m (otherwise, if rank is always less, then by some argument, f is not injective). If Df(a) has rank m, construct F(x) = (f(x), x_{m+1}, ..., x_n), which has invertible derivative at a. Apply Inverse Function Theorem to get a local diffeomorphism, then find points differing in the last n - m coordinates with the same f(x), contradicting injectivity.\n\nBut wait, how do we ensure that Df(a) has rank m? If f is injective, can Df(a) have rank less than m everywhere? If so, how to handle that case?\n\nIf Df(x) has rank less than m for all x, then the image of f has measure zero in R^m by Sard's Theorem. But since f is injective and continuous, the image would be homeomorphic to R^n, which can't have measure zero in R^m if n > m ≥ 1. Wait, but R^n can't be homeomorphic to a measure zero subset of R^m because measure zero sets are nowhere dense, but R^n is a complete metric space. This might be a topological argument. However, maybe this is overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, if Df(x) has rank less than m everywhere, then the columns of Df(x) are linearly dependent everywhere. Therefore, there exists a non-zero vector field v(x) such that Df(x)(v(x)) = 0 for all x. If we can integrate this vector field to get a curve along which f is constant, then f is not injective. However, integrating a varying vector field is non-trivial, but if we can find a single direction where the derivative is zero, then f is constant along that direction. But the problem is that the vector field could vary with x.\n\nHowever, maybe in this case, using the fact that the derivative has constant rank (less than m), we can apply the Frobenius theorem to find an integral submanifold, and then f would be constant along that submanifold, hence not injective. But this requires the distribution defined by the kernel of Df(x) to be integrable, which it is if it's involutive. Since the kernel is the tangent spaces to the level sets of f, which is a foliation if the distribution is involutive.\n\nBut perhaps this is too advanced for the context of Spivak's \"Calculus on Manifolds\", which does cover the Constant Rank Theorem and maybe the Frobenius theorem. However, the user is asking for a generalization of their m=1 argument.\n\nIn the m=1 case, they split into two cases: either the derivative is zero everywhere, leading to independence of the first variable, hence non-injective, or the derivative is non-zero somewhere, leading to constructing g and using the Inverse Function Theorem.\n\nFor higher m, maybe similarly, either the derivative has rank m somewhere, in which case the above argument applies, or it has rank less than m everywhere, and then f is not injective because it's \"constant\" along some directions.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the derivative has rank less than m everywhere? For example, if the rank is k < m everywhere, then the image is a k-dimensional submanifold, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if all partial derivatives are linearly dependent, then there's a direction in which the function doesn't change, leading to non-injectivity.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Suppose the result holds for m-1, then prove for m. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if Df(x) has rank less than m everywhere, then there exists a non-trivial linear combination of the rows that is zero. So, there exists a non-zero vector α ∈ R^m such that α ⋅ Df(x) = 0 for all x. This would imply that the directional derivative of α ⋅ f(x) in any direction is zero, hence α ⋅ f(x) is constant. Therefore, f maps R^n into an affine subspace of R^m orthogonal to α, hence reducing the problem to m-1 dimensions. By induction, since n > m ≥ m-1, unless m-1 =0, but if α ⋅ f(x) is constant, then f is not injective because you can vary the other components. Wait, this might not hold. If α ⋅ f(x) is constant, say c, then f(x) lies in the hyperplane α ⋅ y = c. But within that hyperplane, which is (m-1)-dimensional, can we apply induction? If n > m, then n > m-1, so by induction hypothesis, the map from R^n to R^{m-1} can't be injective. Therefore, the restriction of f to the hyperplane would not be injective, hence f itself isn't injective.\n\nBut this requires that the derivative Df(x) has a non-trivial linear dependence among its rows everywhere, i.e., the rank is ≤ m-1 everywhere. Then, by the above, some linear combination of the components of f is constant, hence f is not injective.\n\nTherefore, combining both cases:\n\nCase 1: There exists a point a where rank Df(a) = m. Then, construct F(x) = (f(x), x_{m+1}, ..., x_n), use Inverse Function Theorem to show that in a neighborhood, we can vary the last n - m coordinates while keeping f(x) constant, contradicting injectivity.\n\nCase 2: rank Df(x) < m for all x. Then, there exists a non-zero α ∈ R^m such that α ⋅ Df(x) = 0 for all x, hence α ⋅ f(x) is constant. Therefore, f maps into an affine hyperplane, which is R^{m-1}, and by induction, f can't be injective.\n\nThis seems to cover all possibilities. Therefore, the proof outline would be:\n\n1. Assume f: R^n → R^m is C¹ and injective, with n > m.\n\n2. If there exists a point a where rank Df(a) = m, then construct F(x) = (f(x), x_{m+1}, ..., x_n). Show that DF(a) is invertible, apply Inverse Function Theorem to get a local diffeomorphism, and find two points in the domain that differ in the last n - m coordinates but have the same f(x), contradicting injectivity.\n\n3. If rank Df(x) < m for all x, then there exists a non-zero α ∈ R^m such that α ⋅ Df(x) = 0 for all x, implying α ⋅ f(x) is constant. Hence, f factors through an affine hyperplane R^{m-1}, and by induction on m, f cannot be injective.\n\nThe base case for induction would be m=1, which the user already solved.\n\nTherefore, the answer should structure the problem accordingly, listing the assumptions and then the problem statement. The user's example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the assumptions are about the function f.\n\nLooking back at the original question:\n\n\"How to show that a continuously differentiable function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ can't be a 1-1 when $n>m$?
