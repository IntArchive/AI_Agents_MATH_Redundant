    "Content": "I wish to ask today's Putnam problem B6: Suppose $p$ is an odd prime. Prove that for $n\\in \\{0,1,2...p-1\\}$, at least $\\frac{p+1}{2}$ number of $\\sum^{p-1}_{k=0} k! n^{k}$ is not divisble by $p$. For example, for $p=3$, we have $(0,1,2)$ corresponds to $(0, 1+1+2,1+2+2*4)$. For $p=5$, we have $(0,1,2,3,4)$ corresponds to $(0,1+1+2+6+24,1+2+2*4+6*8+24*16..)$. It is to be expected that an official solution can be found in somewhere (the Putnam archive, American Mathematical Monthly, AOPS, etc). My point of raising this question is not to ask a solution of it, because I am not interested in problem solving techniques. Instead I want to ask the following questions: 1) Is the function $\\sum\\limits_{k=0} ^{p-1}  k! n^{k}$ well known? Can it be expressed in some closed form via generating functions or other combinatorical tools? My combinatorical background is very weak so I think I should ask others. 2) In general how strong the statement is? For example, for $p$ quite large, how many elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ tend to satisfy $\\sum \\limits_{k=0} ^{p-1} k! n^{k}=0$? 3) It is possible to see the problem via some 'high level' proof? (I know David Speyer is found of this kind of thing). Because I am not specialized in number theory, the limited number theory knowledge I have in Dedekind domains and valuations seems to be quite irrelevant to this problem. But I think there should be some way this small problem generalizes to something more interesting to an expert.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Edit: Asked on Overflow: There are some very good answer which can be found here which explain some deeper meaning: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/82648/truncated-exponential-series-modulo-p-deeper-meaning-for-a-putnam-question I feel that looking at $\\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} k!n^k$ without changing its form is the wrong way to approach this problem, and if there are deeper solutions they will come by modifying this first.  After some rearrangements modulo $p$, what we are really looking at is the truncated exponential series. Rephrasing the question: First, let us ignore $n=0$, as in this case the sum is just $1$, and instead consider only the multiplicative group.  Letting $k=p-1-l$ and using Wilsons theorem and Fermats little theorem we can rewrite our sum as $$\\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}k!n^{k}\\equiv\\sum_{l=0}^{p-1}(p-1-l)!n^{p-1-l}\\equiv-\\sum_{l=0}^{p-1}\\frac{1}{(p-l)(p-l+1)\\cdots(p-1)}n^{-l} $$  $$\\equiv -\\sum_{l=0}^{p-1}(-1)^{l}\\frac{n^{-l}}{l!}.$$ Using the fact that $n\\rightarrow p-n $ and $n\\rightarrow n^{-1}$  are isomorphisms of the multiplicative group, we have reduced the problem to considering for which $n$ we have $$-\\sum_{l=0}^{p-1}\\frac{x^{l}}{l!}=0.$$ This means that the original problem is equivalent to bounding the number of zeros modulo $p$ of the truncated exponential function $$E(z)=\\sum_{l=0}^{p-1}\\frac{z^{l}}{l!}.$$ Proof of the question: Consider  $$Q(z)=z^{p}-z+\\sum_{l=0}^{p-1}\\frac{z^{l}}{l!}.$$ Then for each integer $Q(n)=E(n).$ However, $$Q^{'}(z)\\equiv E^{'}(z)-1=E(z)-\\frac{z^{p-1}}{(p-1)!}-1\\equiv E(z)+z^{p-1}-1.$$ Then, if $Q(n)=0$  for $n\\neq0$ , we must also have $Q^{'}(n)=0$  so that $n$ is a double root of $Q(n).$ Since $\\deg Q(n)=p$, we see that at most half of the integers $p\\in\\left\\{ 1,2,\\dots,p-1\\right\\}$ satisfy $E(n)=0.$ Since $E(0)=1$, we conclude the desired result. Motivation: The first idea I had looked at $E(z)-E(-z)$, but if you carry through with the computations you can only show that at least $\\frac{p-1}{4}$ are non zero.  Instead, lets just look at the derivative of $E(z)$ which is $E(z)+z^{p-1}$.  Knowing that multiple zeros are what we want as it means less zeros total, we must add a function whose derivative is $-1$ since this will force multiple zeros.  The obvious choice is then $x^p-x$, as it leaves the original polynomial invariant. Remark: If you ask about the truncated exponential, there are many papers in existence and probably a high level way to see the problem.  For example, see the first part of http://www.science.unitn.it/~mattarei/Ricerca/Preprints/AH.pdf",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem as per the required format. The user provided an example, so I need to follow that. \n\nFirst, the original problem from Math Stack Exchange is about an odd prime p and a sum involving factorials and powers. The task is to prove that for n in the set {0,1,2,...,p-1}, at least (p+1)/2 of these numbers make the sum not divisible by p.\n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for this problem:\n\n1. The first assumption is that p is an odd prime. That's a single condition on p.\n2. The second part is about n being in the set {0,1,2,...,p-1}. So n is an element of that specific set.\n\nThe problem statement itself is the main thing to prove: that at least (p+1)/2 of those sums are not divisible by p.\n\nNow, the user's question in the original post includes some extra parts asking about the function's properties, closed forms, etc., but according to the instructions, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The user mentioned that their point isn't to ask for a solution but to ask other questions. However, the task here is to structure the problem as per the given format, focusing only on the problem to be solved, not the additional questions. So the additional questions about the function being well-known, closed forms, etc., are irrelevant for the Assumption and Problem sections. The example provided also ignored similar extra parts, focusing only on the core problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- p is an odd prime.\n- n is an element of {0,1,2,…,p−1}.\n\nThe problem is to prove that at least (p+1)/2 numbers of the sum Σ_{k=0}^{p-1} k! n^k are not divisible by p.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one line, one condition. The problem statement should be concise, capturing the main task without the extra discussion. The example didn't include the specific examples for p=3 and p=5, so those can be omitted here as well. Similarly, references to solutions or other questions are part of the original post but not the problem structure required.",
