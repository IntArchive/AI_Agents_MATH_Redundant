    "Content": "$$P(x)=x^{4}-4x^{3}+12x^{2}-24x+24$$ I'd like to prove that $P(x)=|P(x)|$ . I don't know where to begin. What would be the first step?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": ".In this question, you have to attempt to complete two squares, namely: $$\nx^4-4x^3 + 12x^2-24x+24 = x^4 -4x^3+6x^2-4x+1 + 6x^2-20x+23 \n\\\\  = (x-1)^4 + 6x^2 -20x+23\n$$ Now, as it turns out, we can complete the second square, and: $$\n6x^2-20x+23 = \\frac{2}{3}(3x-5)^2 + \\frac{19}{3} \n$$ Hence, we can rewrite the whole expression as: $$\nx^4-4x^3 + 12x^2-24x+24 = (x-1)^4 + \\frac{2}{3}(3x-5)^2 + \\frac{19}{3}\n$$ It is a sum of positive expressions, hence is always positive, hence $P(x) = |P(x)|$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object. The problem statement is then restated clearly.\n\nLooking at the problem from Math Stack Exchange: The polynomial is given as P(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 12x² -24x +24. The task is to prove that P(x) equals the absolute value of itself for all real x. That means P(x) is always non-negative, right? Because if P(x) were negative somewhere, then |P(x)| would be positive, and they wouldn't be equal. So the key here is to show that P(x) is non-negative for all real x.\n\nNow, the original problem might have some hidden assumptions. Let me check if there are any conditions mentioned. The user just provided the polynomial and the question. The title says \"for all real x,\" so that's an important condition. Also, the polynomial is a quartic, which might have even degree, leading coefficient positive, so it tends to infinity as x approaches both positive and negative infinity. But that's general knowledge about quartic functions, not an assumption given in the problem. The problem doesn't state any restrictions except that x is real.\n\nWait, the example provided had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the user's problem states \"for all real x,\" so maybe the assumption is that x is real. But in the example, the assumption was listed even if it's part of the problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" which was translated into the assumption \"n is an integer.\" So following that, here, the problem states \"for all real x,\" so the assumption should be \"x is a real number.\"\n\nBut the question is, does the problem have any other assumptions? The polynomial is given, but there's no additional information. So the only assumption here is that x is real. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that as an assumption, and the problem is to prove that P(x) = |P(x)| for all real x, which is equivalent to proving P(x) is non-negative for all real x.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n,\" which was split into two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait no, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" then the assumption should only be \"n is an integer,\" but the formatted problem in the example adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps there was a typo. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" But that's contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so there shouldn't be an additional divisibility by 7 unless the problem was misrepresented. This might be an error in the example. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that in some cases, assumptions are split even if they are part of the problem statement. But in the current problem, the question is about P(x) = |P(x)| for all real x. So the only assumption is that x is real. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption should be \"x is a real number,\" and the problem is to prove that P(x) = |P(x)|.\n\nWait, but the problem in the example added an extra assumption that wasn't in the original. Maybe the example had a mistake. But regardless, the user wants me to structure the current problem according to their format. So following the example, perhaps even if the problem states \"for all real x,\" the assumption should list \"x is a real number.\" That seems correct. So in this case, the assumption is \"x is a real number,\" and the problem is to prove that P(x) equals its absolute value. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that P(x) = |P(x)|.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that for all real x, P(x) is non-negative. But since the user's example took the original problem's \"for every integer n\" and split into an assumption, perhaps here \"for all real x\" is part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then the problem becomes \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Similarly, here, the original problem is \"Prove that P(x) = |P(x)| for all real x.\" So the formatted problem should have assumption: x is a real number, and the problem: Prove that P(x) = |P(x)|.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption: x is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that P(x) = |P(x)|.\n\nI think that's it. The problem doesn't have any other hidden assumptions. The polynomial is given as is, and the only condition is that x is real. Therefore, the answer should follow this structure.",
