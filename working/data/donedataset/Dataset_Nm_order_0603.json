    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user is interested in proving that the integral of 1 over (cosh x + (1/2)e^{ix√3}) squared from -infty to infty equals 4/3. They also mention equivalent forms and other related integrals like (2) and (3). The user is asking for alternative proofs and possible generalizations.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the main problem and list all the assumptions. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, I need to look for similar conditions in the integral problem.\n\nLooking at the integral in the title: ∫_{-infty}^infty dx / (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{ix√3})² = 1/3. Wait, the title says 1/3, but in the question, equation (1) states 4/3. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the title of the question is \"Proof ∫_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx / (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{ix√3})² = 1/3\", but in the question, equation (1) is ∫_{-infty}^\\infty dx / (cosh x + ½ e^{ix√3})² = 4/3. The user mentions that (1a) is equivalent. Let me see why there's a difference. Since cosh x = (e^x + e^{-x})/2, so cosh x + ½ e^{ix√3} would be (e^x + e^{-x})/2 + (1/2)e^{ix√3} = [e^x + e^{-x} + e^{ix√3}]/2. So the denominator in the title is (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{ix√3})², but in equation (1) it's [ (e^x + e^{-x})/2 + (1/2)e^{ix√3} ]² = [ (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{ix√3} ) / 2 ]². So the denominator in (1) is ( [ ... ] / 2 ) squared, which would be 1/4 of the denominator in the title. Hence, the integral in the title is over 1/(denominator), which would be 4 times the integrand in (1). Therefore, if (1) is 4/3, then the title's integral would be 4/(3*4) = 1/3, which matches. So the title's integral is equivalent to equation (1) scaled by a factor. Therefore, the main problem to structure is the one in the title, which the user is trying to prove: ∫_{-infty}^infty [1/(e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}})^2] dx = 1/3. But wait, the user's equation (1) is given as 4/3. So perhaps the problem to state here is the one from the title, or the one from equation (1)? The user says \"the integral\" in the question, but the title is about proving the integral equals 1/3. However, equation (1) is 4/3. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the question: The user states equation (1) as ∫_{-infty}^\\infty dx / (cosh x + ½ e^{i x sqrt{3}})^2 = 4/3. Then in the title, it's ∫ dx / (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}})^2 = 1/3. Since cosh x = (e^x + e^{-x})/2, so substituting that into equation (1)'s denominator: cosh x + ½ e^{i x sqrt{3}} = (e^x + e^{-x})/2 + ½ e^{i x sqrt{3}} = (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}} ) / 2. So the denominator in (1) is [ (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}} ) / 2 ]² = (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}} )² / 4. Hence, the integrand in (1) is 4 / (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}} )². Therefore, integrating over x from -infty to infty, ∫ [4 / ( ... )² ] dx = 4/3, so ∫ [1 / ( ... )² ] dx = 1/3, which is the title's integral. Therefore, the problem in the title is equivalent to equation (1) scaled by 4. Therefore, the problem to state here is either one, but probably the title's version, as that's the main focus. However, the user starts the question by talking about equation (1) being equal to 4/3. So perhaps the main problem to present is equation (1), but the title's integral is another equivalent form. The user wants to prove the integral in equation (1), which is 4/3. But the title says 1/3. So the answer should clarify which one is the main problem. However, since the user's first sentence says they are interested in generalizations of the integral ∫_{-infty}^\\infty dx / (cosh x + ½ e^{i x sqrt{3}})^2 = 4/3, and that's equation (1). So perhaps the main problem is equation (1). But in the title, it's a different integrand. This is confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the title is: \"Proof ∫_{-infty}^\\infty dx / (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}})^2 = 1/3\". But equation (1) is ∫_{-infty}^\\infty dx / (cosh x + ½ e^{i x sqrt{3}})^2 = 4/3. As cosh x = (e^x + e^{-x})/2, so the denominator in equation (1) is [ (e^x + e^{-x})/2 + (1/2)e^{i x sqrt{3}} ] = [e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}} ] / 2. Therefore, squaring that gives denominator [ (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}} )^2 ] / 4. Hence, the integrand in equation (1) is 4 / (e^x + e^{-x} + e^{i x sqrt{3}} )^2. Therefore, ∫ from -infty to infty of 4 / ( ... )^2 dx = 4/3, so ∫ 1/(...)^2 dx = 1/3, which is the title's statement. So equation (1) and the title integral are equivalent, differing by a factor of 4. Therefore, the problem could be phrased either way. However, the user's main problem seems to be equation (1) as they start with that. But the title is the other form. To avoid confusion, perhaps the problem should be presented as in equation (1), with the assumption that the integrand is in terms of cosh x and the complex exponential. Let me see the example given. The example had the problem statement as the original expression. So here, the main problem is equation (1), so the user wants to prove that integral equals 4/3, which is equivalent to the title's integral equals 1/3. However, the user provides equation (1a) as ∫_0^infty dt / (1 + t + t^α)^2 = 2/3, with α = (1 + i sqrt3)/2. But the problem is to structure the problem as per the format, so assumptions and the problem. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. For equation (1), the integrand is 1 / (cosh x + (1/2) e^{i x sqrt3})^2, integrated over all real x. What are the assumptions here? The variables are real, x ranges from -infty to infty, and the parameters in the integrand are fixed. The problem is to prove the integral equals 4/3. Are there any specific conditions? The problem doesn't state any restrictions, so maybe the only assumption is that x is a real variable and the integral is over the entire real line. Wait, but in the example, assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumption is that x is a real variable, and the integral is from -infty to infty. However, the example's assumptions were specific to the problem's variables. So for this integral problem, perhaps the assumption is that the integral is over the real line, and the integrand is as given. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions were properties of n. Here, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral being over real x. However, looking at the problem statement, the user might be assuming that the integral converges, or that certain conditions hold for the integrand. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the structure of the integrand. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no: the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted problem, the assumptions included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that the answerer might have made a mistake. Wait, no: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the example, the formatted problem's assumption is n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's different. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which would restrict n. That seems conflicting. Maybe the example is for a different problem. Wait, perhaps the example is hypothetical. Regardless, following the instructions, I need to list all assumptions of the problem, each as a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from -infty to infty, so x is a real variable. The integrand involves cosh x, which is defined for all real x, and the complex exponential e^{i x sqrt3}, which is also defined for all real x. There's no restriction on x mentioned, so perhaps the only assumption is that x is a real variable. But maybe the problem assumes that the integral converges, which it does, but that's part of the problem's statement. The example didn't list convergence as an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. Wait, the example had assumptions about the variable n. Here, the variable is x, but the problem doesn't state any conditions on x except that it's integrated over the entire real line. So maybe the assumption is simply that x is a real variable. But in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem's integral is over all real x, so x is real. However, perhaps the problem assumes that the integrand is defined in such a way that it's integrable. But the example didn't list convergence as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the integral being in the given form. But the user's problem might require some conditions for the integral to hold, but the problem as stated just presents the integral and claims it equals 4/3. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions other than the integral's form. But the example included assumptions, so maybe I need to list the components of the integrand. For example, the integrand involves cosh x and e^{i x sqrt3}. Maybe the assumptions are that cosh x is the hyperbolic cosine function, and the exponential is the complex exponential. But those are standard definitions. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions, and the problem is as stated. However, the example had two assumptions, so perhaps here we need to list the components of the integrand as assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the integrand is given, so maybe the assumptions are about the form of the integrand. Wait, perhaps the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup, so the assumptions section could be empty. But the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state any beyond \"n is an integer\". So maybe for this problem, the assumption is that x is a real variable. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable,\nthe integral is taken over the entire real line.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, x being real and the integral over the real line are part of the problem's statement. Therefore, maybe the assumptions should include:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable,\nthe integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\left( \\cosh x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{ix\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2}$,\nthe integral is evaluated over $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n's properties. Here, the problem's setup includes the integrand and the limits, so perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the problem's statement. However, the example's formatted problem included the assumptions even though they were part of the original problem's statement. So following that, I should list the components as assumptions. For example, in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption is n is an integer, and then the problem statement includes that. Here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\left( \\cosh x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{ix\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2}$.\n- The integral is over the real line from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$.\n\nBut the example didn't list the components of A(n) as assumptions, only the properties of n. So perhaps here, the only assumption is that the integral is over the real line, and x is real. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the integral equals 4/3, the assumptions are inherent in the problem statement. But according to the example, the assumptions should list conditions on the variables. Since in the example, n was an integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which means the proof should hold for any integer n, not just those divisible by 7. However, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem requires that n satisfies some conditions? Wait, perhaps the example is from a different problem where the divisibility by 91 requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which might not be accurate. Maybe there's an error in the example. But regardless, the user's instruction is to follow that format.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the integral is over real x, and the integrand is given. The problem is to prove the integral equals 4/3. So following the example, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real variable.\n- The integrand is 1 divided by (cosh x + (1/2)e^{i x sqrt(3)}) squared.\n- The integral is taken from -infty to infty.\n\nBut the example listed two assumptions for n. Here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable,\nthe integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\left( \\cosh x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{ix\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2}$,\nthe integral is evaluated over the entire real line.\n\nBut the example had each assumption as one line, each addressing one property. However, in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. That suggests that maybe the answerer added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which contradicts the original problem's \"for every integer n\". Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as an example. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions should include any implicit conditions. However, in the given problem here, the integral is presented as is, without additional conditions. So maybe the only assumption is that the integral is over the real line. But in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like an error. Therefore, perhaps the instructions are to list all the assumptions present in the problem, not adding new ones. But in the example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. That's confusing. Therefore, maybe the user wants to extract all conditions mentioned in the problem. In the current problem, the user mentions several integrals and asks to prove (1), which is ∫_{-infty}^infty dx / (cosh x + ½ e^{i x sqrt3})² =4/3. The problem statement doesn't mention any conditions on x other than integrating over the real line. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is over all real numbers.\n- The integrand is as given: 1/(cosh x + ½ e^{i x sqrt3})².\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property of one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable,\nthe integral is evaluated from -infty to infty,\nthe integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\left( \\cosh x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{ix\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2}$.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions for the variable n. Here, three assumptions. However, the example might have been specific to that problem. Since the user's instruction is to follow the format, listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable,\nthe integral is taken over the entire real line,\nthe integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\left( \\cosh x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{ix\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\left( \\cosh x + \\frac{1}{2} e^{ix\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2} = \\frac{4}{3}.\n$$\n\nBut the title of the question has a different integrand but equivalent. However, the user's main problem is equation (1), which is the integral equaling 4/3. The title's integral is equivalent but scaled, resulting in 1/3. Since the user starts with equation (1), I should use that as the problem statement. Alternatively, if the user wants the title's integral, then the problem is that. But the user's question starts with the integral in equation (1). Therefore, I'll structure the problem based on equation (1).\n\nBut let me check the original problem again. The user writes:\n\n\"I'm interested in possible generalizations of the integral\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\frac{dx}{\\left(\\cosh x+\\frac{1}{2}e^{ix\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2}=\\frac{4}{3},\\tag{1}\n$$\nor equivalently\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{dt}{(1+t+t^{\\,\\alpha})^2}=\\frac23, \\quad \\alpha=\\frac{1+i\\sqrt3}{2}, \\tag{1a}\n$$\n...\nHowever, I couldn't apply this technique to find any other integrals of similar kind calculable in closed form that have simple form as $(1),(2),(3)$. ...
