    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show that the infinite product ∏_{n=0}^∞ (1 + x^{2^n}) equals 1/(1 - x). Hmm, I remember that infinite products can sometimes be related to geometric series. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the product given is (1 + x)(1 + x^2)(1 + x^4)(1 + x^8)... So each term is (1 + x^{2^n}). When you multiply these out, each term in the expansion would be a product of some combination of the exponents. For example, multiplying (1 + x)(1 + x^2) gives 1 + x + x^2 + x^3. Then multiplying by (1 + x^4) would add terms up to x^7. It seems like each multiplication doubles the highest exponent. So after n terms, the product would give a sum of x^k from k=0 to 2^{n} - 1. If you take the infinite product, maybe that becomes the sum from k=0 to infinity of x^k, which is indeed 1/(1 - x) for |x| < 1. But how to formalize this?\n\nWait, the user mentioned they realized the product equals the sum ∑_{n=0}^∞ x^n. If they can show that the product expands to that sum, then since the sum is 1/(1 - x), the identity is proven. So maybe induction is a way. Let's try mathematical induction.\n\nBase case: For n=0, the product is just (1 + x). The sum up to x^1 is 1 + x. So that matches. Now, assume that the product up to n = k gives the sum up to x^{2^{k+1} - 1}. Then multiply by (1 + x^{2^{k+1}}). The product would be [sum_{m=0}^{2^{k+1} - 1} x^m] * (1 + x^{2^{k+1}}}). Multiplying out, this gives sum_{m=0}^{2^{k+1} -1} x^m + sum_{m=0}^{2^{k+1} -1} x^{m + 2^{k+1}}}. Which is sum from m=0 to 2^{k+2} -1} x^m. Thus, by induction, each step doubles the exponent range. Taking the infinite product would then cover all exponents, hence the product equals the infinite sum, which is 1/(1 - x). That seems to make sense. But maybe there's another approach using telescoping products or binary representations. \n\nAlternatively, consider that each term in the product adds a binary digit. Since every number can be uniquely represented in binary, each x^n term is generated exactly once by choosing the appropriate factors in the product. For example, x^5 = x^{1 + 4} = x^{2^0 + 2^2}, so it would come from multiplying the terms (1 + x^{2^0}) and (1 + x^{2^2}), and not including others. But since the product includes all terms, every integer has a unique binary representation, so each x^n is produced exactly once. Therefore, the product equals the sum of x^n from n=0 to infinity. Hence, it's 1/(1 - x). \n\nBut the user is asking how to derive this. Maybe they need to formalize this argument. Let's check the assumptions. The problem states to show the equality. The assumptions needed would probably be that |x| < 1 to ensure convergence of both the product and the sum. Also, that the product is taken over all n >= 0. So the key assumptions would be about the convergence of the product and the sum. Each term in the product is (1 + x^{2^n}), and x is such that |x| < 1. The product converges because the exponents grow exponentially, so the terms approach 1 quickly enough. The sum converges to 1/(1 - x) for |x| < 1. So the main assumptions are on the value of x for convergence. The problem might not state these explicitly, so maybe in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include |x| < 1 and that the product is infinite. Let me check the example again. The example had assumptions on n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to show the equality, so the assumption is likely on x's absolute value being less than 1. \n\nWait, the original problem just says \"Show: product equals 1/(1 - x)\". But maybe the user is assuming convergence. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would need to include that |x| < 1. Each term in the product is (1 + x^{2^n}), and the product is taken from n=0 to infinity. So the assumptions should list that x is a real or complex number with |x| < 1, and the product is infinite. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real or complex number with |x| < 1,\nthe product is taken over all non-negative integers n.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(1 + x^{2^n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - x}$$.\n\nBut the original question didn't specify the convergence condition, but since the equality is for the infinite product and sum, it's implicit that |x| < 1 is required. So the user might not have mentioned it, but as a professor structuring the problem, we should include the necessary assumptions. Let me verify with the example given. In the example, the original problem had an integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption added that n is divisible by 7, but that's incorrect. Wait, actually in the example, maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Perhaps the example is incorrect. Wait, maybe the user intended to structure the problem correctly. For the given problem here, the example might have a typo. However, in our current problem, the key assumptions are about x's absolute value and the product being infinite. So I think the correct assumptions here are |x| < 1 and the product is infinite. So the formatted problem should include those.",
