    "Content": "A problem is bugging me many years after I first met it: Prove that any closed subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the boundary of some set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. I have toyed with this problem several times over the last 20 years, but I have never managed to either prove it, or conversely prove that the question as posed is in some way wrong. I can't remember which book I found the question in originally (but I am pretty sure that is exactly the question as it appeared in the book). Any help, with either the topology or the source would be gratefully received!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a very elementary way to solve this, that is also much more widely applicable. Let $Y$ be a topological space that can be partitioned into dense subsets $D$ and $E$ . If $X \\subset Y$ is closed, then there is a $V \\subset X$ such that $\\operatorname{Fr} V = X$ . Take $V = X \\setminus (D \\cap \\operatorname{Int} X)$ . Then since $V \\subset X$ we have $\\operatorname{Cl} V \\subset \\operatorname{Cl} X$ , and $\\operatorname{Fr} V \\subset X$ and $E \\cap \\operatorname{Int} X$ dense in $\\operatorname{Int} X$ , therefore $\\operatorname{Cl} V = X$ . On the other hand $Y \\setminus  X$ is dense in $Y \\setminus \\operatorname{Int} X$ and $D \\cap \\operatorname{Int} X$ is dense in $\\operatorname{Int} X$ , therefore $\\operatorname{Int} V = \\emptyset$ . It follows that $ \\operatorname{Fr} V = X$ . Some additional information: The question probably came from Willard's General topology , problem 3 B. As Henno Brandsma pointed out in a comment, a space that can be partitioned into\ntwo dense subsets is called resolvable . For some examples of irresolvable spaces, see the answer to \"Is a perfect set a boundary?\" . A somewhat stronger result can be found in \"Any two disjoint open sets are the interior and exterior of some set\" .",

For any closed set $C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$, let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $C$ (which exists since $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is separable). Define $A = (\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus C) \\cup D$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that every closed set in ℝ² is the boundary of some other subset. Hmm, boundaries... I remember that the boundary of a set S is the closure of S minus the interior of S. So, ∂S = closure(S) \\ interior(S). And a closed set in ℝ² would be one that contains all its limit points. \n\nWait, the problem states that any closed set is the boundary of another set. So, given a closed set C in ℝ², we need to find a set A such that ∂A = C. Let me recall some properties of boundaries. The boundary of a set is always closed. So, since C is closed, at least that condition is satisfied. That makes sense because boundaries are closed sets.\n\nNow, how to construct such a set A? Let me think of examples. For instance, if C is the boundary of a closed disk, then the disk itself has boundary C. But here, the problem is more general. Any closed set, not just boundaries of other sets. Wait, but the problem says that the closed set is the boundary of some set. So even if C is a closed set that isn't the boundary of anything \"naturally\", we need to find some A where ∂A = C.\n\nLet me think about the real line first. In ℝ, the boundary of a set is the set of points where every neighborhood contains points of the set and its complement. Maybe similar ideas apply in ℝ². But in ℝ², the topology is different. \n\nI remember that in topology, a set is a boundary if and only if it is closed and has empty interior. Wait, no. Because the boundary of any set is closed, but it's possible for a boundary to have non-empty interior. For example, the boundary of ℚ² in ℝ² is ℝ² itself, which has non-empty interior. Wait, but ℚ² is dense, so its closure is ℝ², and its interior is empty, so the boundary is ℝ². So in that case, the boundary is the whole space, which has non-empty interior. So maybe that's a case where a boundary does have non-empty interior. \n\nBut the problem here is that we need any closed set to be a boundary. So even if the closed set has a non-empty interior, we can still find a set A such that ∂A equals that closed set. Wait, but is that possible? If C has non-empty interior, can it be the boundary of some set? Let's see. For example, take C to be the closed unit disk. Its boundary is the circle. But can the closed unit disk itself be the boundary of another set? The closed unit disk is not the boundary of itself because the boundary of the closed unit disk is the circle. To have the closed unit disk as a boundary, maybe consider the closed unit disk as part of the boundary of another set. Hmm, not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in ℝ², so higher dimensional. Maybe there's a way to construct such a set. Let me think of the standard example where the boundary is the entire space. For example, ℝ² is the boundary of the empty set, but no, the boundary of the empty set is empty. Wait, the boundary of ℝ² is empty because its interior is ℝ², so closure minus interior is empty. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, consider a set A such that its closure is ℝ² and its interior is ℝ² \\ C. Then the boundary would be closure(A) \\ interior(A) = ℝ² \\ (ℝ² \\ C) = C. Wait, but how to make sure that closure(A) is ℝ² and interior(A) is ℝ² \\ C. If C is closed, then ℝ² \\ C is open. So if we let A be a dense subset whose interior is ℝ² \\ C. Wait, but how to construct such a set. Let's see. If A is a dense set with interior ℝ² \\ C, then closure(A) is ℝ², and interior(A) is ℝ² \\ C. Therefore, the boundary would be ℝ² \\ (ℝ² \\ C) = C. So, if we can construct such a set A, then ∂A = C. \n\nSo, how to construct A? Let me take A as the union of ℝ² \\ C and a countable dense subset of C. Wait, but ℝ² \\ C is open, and adding a countable dense subset to it. The closure of A would then be the closure of ℝ² \\ C union the closure of the countable dense subset. Since ℝ² \\ C is open, its closure is the closure of an open set. But in ℝ², the closure of ℝ² \\ C is ℝ² \\ interior(C). Wait, no. The closure of the complement is the complement of the interior. So closure(ℝ² \\ C) = ℝ² \\ interior(C). But C is closed, so interior(C) is the largest open set contained in C. But if C is closed, then the closure of ℝ² \\ C is the complement of the interior of C. Hmm, this might not be ℝ² unless interior(C) is empty. \n\nWait, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think of the problem in terms of the desired properties. We need closure(A) \\ interior(A) = C. If I can arrange that closure(A) = C ∪ something, and interior(A) = something else, such that their difference is C. Alternatively, perhaps taking A such that closure(A) is C ∪ Q, where Q is a dense subset in ℝ², and interior(A) is Q. Then the boundary would be closure(A) \\ interior(A) = (C ∪ Q) \\ Q = C \\ Q. But this would only work if Q is disjoint from C. But I don't know. \n\nWait, maybe a simpler construction. Let me recall that in metric spaces, every closed set is the boundary of an open set. Wait, no. For example, in ℝ, the closed interval [a,b] is the boundary of the open interval (a,b), but actually, the boundary of (a,b) is {a,b}, not the whole closed interval. So that doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, in the problem statement, the user mentions that they tried for 20 years and couldn't prove it. Maybe there's a trick here. Let me check some references. Wait, in general topology, is it true that every closed set is the boundary of some set? \n\nHmm, according to the Mazurkiewicz theorem, every closed subset of a complete metric space is the boundary of some open set. Wait, but I need to check. Let me recall. There's a theorem by Mazurkiewicz: In any complete metric space, every closed set is the boundary of an open set. So maybe that's the case here. Since ℝ² is a complete metric space, this theorem would apply. So the problem is true, and the construction involves such an open set. \n\nBut how to construct such an open set? The proof might be non-trivial. Let me think. If C is closed in ℝ², then we need an open set U such that ∂U = C. According to Mazurkiewicz's theorem, such a U exists. So the answer is that yes, it's true, and the proof relies on this theorem. \n\nBut the user probably wants a more constructive approach. Let me think. Let's consider that in ℝ², which is a separable metric space, hence has a countable basis. Maybe we can use some dense subsets. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea. Let me take A = C ∪ (ℝ² \\ C ∩ D), where D is a dense subset of ℝ². Then the closure of A would be C ∪ D closure, but D is dense, so closure(D) is ℝ². So closure(A) = C ∪ ℝ² = ℝ². The interior of A would be the interior of C union the interior of (ℝ² \\ C ∩ D). But the interior of C is the largest open set inside C, and since C is closed, its interior might not be empty. The interior of (ℝ² \\ C ∩ D) is the interior of ℝ² \\ C intersected with the interior of D. But D is dense, so its interior is empty. So interior(ℝ² \\ C ∩ D) is empty. Therefore, interior(A) = interior(C). Therefore, the boundary of A would be closure(A) \\ interior(A) = ℝ² \\ interior(C). But we need this to be equal to C. So ℝ² \\ interior(C) = C. That implies that interior(C) = ℝ² \\ C. But interior(C) is a subset of C, so ℝ² \\ C must be a subset of C. Which would only happen if C = ℝ². Therefore, this approach only works if C is the entire space, which is not the case for arbitrary closed sets. So this construction doesn't work. \n\nHmm, another approach. Let me consider the set A = C ∪ Q, where Q is the set of points in ℝ² \\ C with rational coordinates. Then the closure of A would be closure(C) ∪ closure(Q). Since C is closed, closure(C) = C. Closure(Q) is ℝ² because Q is dense. So closure(A) = C ∪ ℝ² = ℝ². The interior of A would be the interior of C union the interior of Q. The interior of C is int(C), and interior of Q is empty (since Q is dense and totally disconnected). So interior(A) = int(C). Therefore, boundary of A is closure(A) \\ interior(A) = ℝ² \\ int(C). For this to equal C, we need ℝ² \\ int(C) = C. That would imply that int(C) = ℝ² \\ C. But int(C) is contained in C, so ℝ² \\ C must be a subset of C. Which implies that ℝ² \\ C is a subset of C, so ℝ² \\ C is empty. Therefore, C = ℝ². Again, only works if C is the whole space. \n\nNot helpful. So maybe another approach. Let's think of the set A such that A is dense in ℝ² and its complement is also dense. Then the boundary of A is the entire space. But we need to adjust this so that the boundary is a specific closed set C. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the boundary of a set is closed and nowhere dense. Wait, no. The boundary can have non-empty interior, as in the example of the boundary being ℝ². But in general, a boundary is closed. So since C is closed, it's a candidate. \n\nWait, I need to recall that in Mazurkiewicz's theorem, every closed set in a complete metric space is the boundary of some open set. So perhaps the required set A is an open set whose boundary is C. So the problem is to show that for any closed C in ℝ², there exists an open set U such that ∂U = C. \n\nIf that's the case, then the proof would rely on the theorem. But how to prove it? Maybe construct U such that it's a union of balls centered at points of a certain type. \n\nAlternatively, here's a construction idea: For each point x in C, take a sequence of points approaching x from the complement of C and include small open balls around those points in U. But I need to ensure that the closure of U includes C and the interior of U doesn't include C. \n\nWait, but if U is open, then its closure is the smallest closed set containing U. If U is constructed such that its closure is C ∪ U, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the concept of a \"porous\" set. But I don't know if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, think about the complement of C. Since C is closed, ℝ² \\ C is open. Maybe construct U as ℝ² \\ C union some countable dense subset within C. But as before, the closure would be ℝ², and the interior would be ℝ² \\ C, leading to boundary C. Wait, let me check again. \n\nSuppose U = (ℝ² \\ C) ∪ D, where D is a countable dense subset in C. Then U is a union of an open set and a countable set. The closure of U would be closure(ℝ² \\ C) ∪ closure(D). Since ℝ² \\ C is open, its closure is the closure of an open set. In a metric space, the closure of an open set is the same as the union of the open set and its boundary. But the boundary of ℝ² \\ C is the boundary of C, which is C \\ interior(C). Wait, but C is closed, so boundary of C is C \\ interior(C). However, closure(ℝ² \\ C) = ℝ² \\ interior(C). So closure(U) = (ℝ² \\ interior(C)) ∪ closure(D). If D is dense in C, then closure(D) is C. So closure(U) = (ℝ² \\ interior(C)) ∪ C = ℝ² \\ interior(C) ∪ C. Since interior(C) is a subset of C, this would be ℝ² \\ interior(C) ∪ C = ℝ². Therefore, closure(U) = ℝ². \n\nThe interior of U is the largest open set contained in U. Since U contains ℝ² \\ C, which is open, and D. But D is a countable subset of C, which is closed. The interior of U would be ℝ² \\ C, because any open subset of U cannot contain points of D (as they are isolated in U). Therefore, interior(U) = ℝ² \\ C. \n\nThus, the boundary of U is closure(U) \\ interior(U) = ℝ² \\ (ℝ² \\ C) = C. \n\nWait, this works! So the construction is U = (ℝ² \\ C) ∪ D, where D is a countable dense subset of C. Then ∂U = C. \n\nBut wait, why is D a countable dense subset? In a separable metric space like ℝ², every closed subset is separable, so there exists a countable dense subset D in C. Then U is the union of the open set ℝ² \\ C and D. Then the closure of U is indeed ℝ², and the interior of U is ℝ² \\ C. Therefore, the boundary is C. \n\nBut is U an open set? Wait, U is ℝ² \\ C union D. But D is a subset of C. So U is the open set ℝ² \\ C plus some points from C. But open sets in topology are defined as sets where every point has a neighborhood contained in the set. However, points in D are isolated in U only if they have neighborhoods in U that don't contain other points. But since D is dense in C, and C is closed, but D is countable, each point in D is not necessarily isolated. For example, take C to be the closed unit disk. D is a countable dense subset in C. Then U is the open complement of the disk union D. The points in D are in the closure of U, but they are not interior points because any neighborhood around them intersects the complement of U (which is C \\ D). Wait, but U includes D, so the complement of U is C \\ D. But since D is dense in C, the complement of U is C \\ D, which is closed? \n\nWait, no. The complement of U is C \\ D. Because U is (ℝ² \\ C) ∪ D, so the complement is C \\ D. \n\nBut then, for a point d in D, any open neighborhood around d will intersect both U and its complement. Because D is dense in C, but C \\ D is also in the complement of U. So any neighborhood around d contains points of U (namely d itself and points from ℝ² \\ C) and points of the complement (C \\ D). Therefore, d is in the boundary of U. But the interior of U is ℝ² \\ C, as those are open points. So the boundary of U is closure(U) \\ interior(U) = ℝ² \\ (ℝ² \\ C) = C. \n\nTherefore, this construction works! So, given any closed set C in ℝ², take a countable dense subset D of C (which exists because ℝ² is separable, hence C is separable), and let U = (ℝ² \\ C) ∪ D. Then the boundary of U is C. Therefore, the answer is yes, every closed set in ℝ² is the boundary of some set, specifically the set U constructed as above. \n\nBut wait, in this construction, U is not necessarily open or closed. It's the union of an open set and a countable set. But the boundary is still C. \n\nSo the problem is solved by constructing such a set U. Therefore, the original problem is correct, and the proof follows by this construction. \n\nSo to answer the user's question: The problem as stated is correct, and the proof involves taking the union of the complement of the closed set C with a countable dense subset of C. The boundary of this union will be C.",
