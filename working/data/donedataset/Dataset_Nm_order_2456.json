    "Content": "I was looking for alternate proofs of the theorem that \"a vector space $V$ of dimension greater than $1$ over an infinite field $\\mathbf{F}$ is not a union of fewer than $|\\mathbf{F}|$ proper subspaces\" and possible generalizations. A simple measure-theoretic proof over $\\mathbb{R}$ is as follows: By countable additivity the sum of the measures of any collection of subspaces is zero since the measure of each subspace is zero, which is a contradiction. I would like to look at proofs over arbitrary infinite fields and would like to know if similar statements hold for say modules (finitely generated or otherwise) over infinite rings.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a proof of the finite dimensional case over any field (finite or infinite): Theorem. Let $\\mathbf{V}$ be a nonzero finite dimensional vector space over $\\mathbf{F}$. If $\\mathbf{V}$ is a union of $\\kappa$ proper subspaces, then $\\kappa\\geq|\\mathbf{F}|$. Proof. Write $\\mathbf{V}=\\bigcup\\limits_{k\\in\\kappa} W_{k}$, with $W_k$ a proper subspace of $\\mathbf{V}$. By enlarging the $W_k$ as necessary, we may assume that $\\dim(\\mathbf{V}/W_i) = 1$ for all $i$. The proof is by induction on $\\dim(\\mathbf{V})$. The result is trivially true if $\\dim(\\mathbf{V})=1$, because $\\mathbf{V}$ is never the union of proper subspaces in this case. For the case of $\\dim(\\mathbf{V})=2$, let $\\{w_1\\}$ be a basis for $W_1$, and let $v\\notin W_1$. For each $\\alpha\\in \\mathbf{F}$ there exists $j_{\\alpha}\\in\\kappa$ such that $w_1+\\alpha v\\in W_{j_{\\alpha}}$. Moreover, if $\\alpha\\neq\\beta$, then $w_1+\\alpha v$ and $w_1+\\beta v$ are linearly independent, since $\\{w_1,v\\}$ are a basis for $\\mathbf{V}$. Thus, no $W_k$ contains more than one $w_1+\\alpha v$. This gives an injection from $\\mathbf{F}$ to $\\kappa$, proving that $\\kappa\\geq|\\mathbf{F}|$, as required. Assume the result holds for $n$-dimensional vector spaces, and let $\\mathbf{V}$ be $(n+1)$-dimensional. Let $\\{w_1,\\ldots,w_n\\}$ be a basis for $W_1$, and $v\\notin W_1$. For each $\\alpha\\in\\mathbf{F}$, consider the $n$-dimensional subspace $W_{\\alpha}=\\mathrm{span}(w_1+\\alpha v,w_2,\\ldots,w_n)$. If $W_{\\alpha}$ is contained in some $W_k$, then $W_{\\alpha}=W_k$ by dimension considerations; and if $W_{\\alpha}=W_{\\beta}$, then $\\alpha=\\beta$, for otherwise we would be able to find a nontrivial linear dependency involving $w_1,\\ldots,w_n,v$. So there is again an injection from the set\n$$S=\\{\\alpha\\in\\mathbf{F} \\mid W_{\\alpha}=W_k\\text{ for some }k\\in \\kappa\\}$$\nto $\\kappa$ (assuming WLOG that the $W_k$ are pairwise distinct). If the set has cardinality $|\\mathbf{F}|$ we are done. Otherwise, let $\\alpha_0\\in\\mathbf{F}\\setminus S$, and look at $W_{\\alpha_0}$. For each $k\\in \\kappa$, $W_{\\alpha_0}\\cap W_k\\neq W_{\\alpha_0}$; since\n$$W_{\\alpha_0} = W_{\\alpha_0}\\cap\\mathbf{V} = W_{\\alpha_0}\\cap\\left(\\bigcup_{k\\in\\kappa}W_k\\right) = \\bigcup_{k\\in\\kappa}(W_{\\alpha_0}\\cap W_k),$$\nthen by the induction hypothesis we have that $\\kappa\\geq|\\mathbf{F}|$. QED I suspect a similar argument can be made in the infinite dimensional case; certainly, we can construct the analogous set to $S$, and if $|S|=|\\mathbf{F}|$ then we are done. But if not, then $\\dim(W_{\\alpha})=\\dim(\\mathbf{V})$, so we cannot really use a reduction argument. But I think there may be a way to tweak this. As Pete L. Clark has noted, the result does not hold in the infinite dimensional case.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows how assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user:\n\nTitle: A vector space over $R$ is not a countable union of proper subspaces\n\nQuestion: They mention a theorem stating that a vector space $V$ of dimension greater than 1 over an infinite field $\\mathbf{F}$ isn't a union of fewer than $|\\mathbf{F}|$ proper subspaces. The user is interested in alternate proofs, especially over arbitrary infinite fields, and generalizations to modules over infinite rings.\n\nThe example given in the problem uses the real numbers as the field and a measure-theoretic argument. The task here is to structure the problem according to the format, which includes listing assumptions and stating the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The theorem has several conditions:\n\n1. $V$ is a vector space.\n2. The dimension of $V$ is greater than 1.\n3. The field $\\mathbf{F}$ over which $V$ is defined is infinite.\n4. The vector space $V$ is being considered as a union of proper subspaces.\n5. The number of such proper subspaces is fewer than the cardinality of $\\mathbf{F}$.\n\nBut wait, in the specific case mentioned in the title, the field is $\\mathbb{R}$ (real numbers), which is an infinite field. The title states that the vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ isn't a countable union of proper subspaces. So in this specific problem, the field is $\\mathbb{R}$, the union is countable, and the dimension is greater than 1.\n\nSo the assumptions for the specific problem mentioned in the title would be:\n\n- $V$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- The dimension of $V$ is greater than 1.\n- The union is countable.\n- Each subspace in the union is a proper subspace of $V$.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions the more general theorem over arbitrary infinite fields. However, the user provided example focuses on a specific case (divisibility by 91 with assumptions on n being integer and divisible by 7). So perhaps the user wants to format the specific case mentioned in the title rather than the general theorem. The title says \"A vector space over $R$ is not a countable union of proper subspaces\". The measure-theoretic proof is given as an example for $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem based on the title and the specific case:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. $V$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2. $\\dim(V) > 1$.\n3. The union is formed by countably many proper subspaces.\n\nProblem: Prove that $V$ cannot be expressed as a countable union of proper subspaces.\n\nWait, but the original problem's title states the theorem, and the user is looking for alternate proofs and generalizations. However, the format requires to extract the problem from the question. The example given in the user's instruction had the original problem mentioning the theorem and then formatting the problem part as the statement to prove, with assumptions listed.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the assumption included n is integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem statement given by the user here, the theorem is already stated. The user's question is about alternate proofs and possible generalizations, but the task is to structure the problem as per the format.\n\nTherefore, focusing on the specific case mentioned in the title: \"A vector space over $R$ is not a countable union of proper subspaces\". So the problem is to prove that, with assumptions.\n\nAssumptions would be:\n\n- $V$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- The dimension of $V$ is greater than 1.\n- The subspaces considered are proper.\n- The union is countable.\n\nProblem: Prove that $V$ cannot be the union of countably many proper subspaces.\n\nAlternatively, checking if the original problem's theorem is the general one, but the title specifies over $\\mathbb{R}$ and countable union. The theorem in the question is more general: over any infinite field, union of fewer than |F| proper subspaces. But the title is a specific case with F=R and union being countable (since |R| is uncountable, so fewer than |F| would include countable).\n\nTherefore, the problem as per the title is a specific instance of the general theorem. The user mentions a measure-theoretic proof over R, so the problem to structure is the specific case over R with countable unions.\n\nThus, the assumptions are:\n\n1. $V$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2. $\\dim(V) > 1$.\n3. There exists a countable collection of proper subspaces of $V$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $V$ is not equal to the union of these countably many proper subspaces.\n\nBut in the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each with one condition. So each assumption should be a single condition on one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n$V$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$,\n$\\dim(V) > 1$,\nThe collection of subspaces is countable,\nEach subspace in the collection is a proper subspace of $V$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $V$ is not a union of countably many proper subspaces.\n\nThat seems to fit the format. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property. The problem is to prove the statement.",
