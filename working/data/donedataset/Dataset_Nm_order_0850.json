    "Content": "I am asked to prove that: For integers $n, x,y > 0$ , where $x,y$ are relatively prime, \n      every $n \\ge (x-1) (y-1)$ can be expressed as $xa + yb$ , with nonnegative integers $a,b \\ge0$ . How should I approach this? I have very limited knowledge in number theory.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We sketch a proof. For my comfort, I will use $a$ and $b$ instead of $x$ and $y$ . Sorry!  So we show that every $n\\ge (a-1)(b-1)$ is representable in the form $au + bv$ with $u$ and $v$ being nonnegative integers. 1. Because $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, there exist integers $x_0,y_0$ (not necessarily both $\\ge 0$ ) such that $ax_0+by_0=1$ . Thus (multiplying through by $n$ ) we find that there exist integers $x_1,y_1$ such that $ax_1+by_1=n$ . 2. Infinitely many solutions of the equation $ax+by=n$ are given by $x=x_1-tb$ , $y=y_1+ta$ , where $t$ ranges over the integers. (Actually these are all solutions, but we won't need this.) 3. Let $t$ be the smallest positive integer such that $y_1+ta\\ge 0$ . We show that $x_1-tb\\ge 0$ .  We have $$a(x_1-tb)+b(y_1+ta)=n \\ge (a-1)(b-1),$$ thus $$a(x_1-tb) \\ge (a-1)(b-1) - b(y_1+ta).$$ But $y_1+ta\\le a-1$ , else we could decrement $t$ . \nThus $$a(x_1-tb)\\ge (a-1)(b-1)-b(a-1) = -(a-1) > -a,$$ and therefore $x_1-tb> -1$ , so that $x_1-tb \\geq 0$ (since $x_1-tb \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ ). So we have produced the required non-negative solution.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about the Frobenius Coin Problem. The user wants to prove that for integers n, x, y greater than 0, where x and y are relatively prime, every n that is greater than or equal to (x-1)(y-1) can be expressed as xa + yb with nonnegative integers a and b. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states several conditions. Let's break them down one by one. \n\n1. The first part mentions integers n, x, y > 0. So each of these variables is a positive integer. That's three separate assumptions: n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, and y is a positive integer. \n\n2. Next, x and y are relatively prime. That means their greatest common divisor is 1. So that's another assumption: x and y are coprime (or relatively prime). \n\n3. Then, the problem specifies that n is greater than or equal to (x-1)(y-1). So the assumption here is that n ≥ (x-1)(y-1). \n\nWait, but in the example given, the user split each assumption into separate lines. For instance, in the example, each assumption was on its own line. So I need to make sure each condition is a separate bullet point.\n\nLooking back, the original problem states: \"For integers n, x,y > 0, where x,y are relatively prime, every n ≥ (x-1)(y-1) can be expressed as xa + yb, with nonnegative integers a,b ≥0.\"\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- x is a positive integer.\n- y is a positive integer.\n- x and y are relatively prime.\n- n ≥ (x - 1)(y - 1).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove that n can be expressed as xa + yb where a and b are non-negative integers. \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. In the current problem, the conditions are n, x, y positive integers, x and y coprime, and n ≥ (x-1)(y-1). So each of those should be separate lines in the assumption section.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"For integers n, x,y > 0, where x,y are relatively prime, every n ≥ (x-1)(y-1) can be expressed as xa + yb, with nonnegative integers a,b ≥0.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. x is a positive integer.\n3. y is a positive integer.\n4. x and y are relatively prime.\n5. n is greater than or equal to (x-1)(y-1).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show that under these conditions, there exist non-negative integers a and b such that n = xa + yb.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", but in this problem, there's no such divisibility condition. Instead, the key conditions are coprimality and the lower bound on n.\n\nSo structuring the problem as per the format:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nx is a positive integer,\ny is a positive integer,\nx and y are relatively prime,\nn is greater than or equal to (x−1)(y−1).\n\nProblem:\nProve that every such n can be expressed as xa + yb with nonnegative integers a and b.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"every n ≥ (x−1)(y−1)\" so the \"every\" is part of the problem statement. So the problem is to prove that for all n satisfying the assumptions, the expression holds. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture all the assumptions and the problem statement correctly.",
