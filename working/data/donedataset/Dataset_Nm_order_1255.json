    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\def\\Z{\\mathbf{Z}}$\n$\\def\\Q{\\mathbf{Q}}$\n$\\def\\PSL{\\mathrm{PSL}}$\n$\\def\\SL{\\mathrm{SL}}$\n$\\def\\inv{\\mathrm{inv}}$\n$\\def\\Br{\\mathrm{Br}}$\n$\\def\\Gal{\\mathrm{Gal}}$\n$\\def\\F{\\mathbf{F}}$\n$\\def\\R{\\mathbf{R}}$\n$\\def\\C{\\mathbf{C}}$ This is a consequence of class field theory. After some obvious reductions, one can assume that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, and that the inertia and decomposition groups at $p$ are given by $I_p = D_p = \\Z/3\\Z \\subset A_4$. Note that $A_4 = \\Gal(K/\\Q) = \\PSL_2(\\F_3)$. Consider the problem of lifting such a representation to $\\SL_2(\\F_3)$, which is a non-split central extension by $\\Z/2\\Z$. Group theory says that the obstruction to such  a lifting lies in $$H^2(G_{\\Q},\\Z/2\\Z) = H^2(G_{\\Q},\\mu_2) = \\Br(\\Q)[2],$$ the $2$-torsion in the Brauer group of $\\Q$. By the Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether theorem (class field theory) the Brauer group injects into the sum of local Brauer groups, so the only obstructions are local. Similarly (again by class field theory), the image of $\\Br(\\Q)$ in the sum of the local Brauer groups is the kernel of the invariant map $\\inv$ to $\\Q/\\Z$, so it follows that any non-trivial class must be non-trivial in $\\Br(\\Q_v)$ for at least two places $v$ of $\\Q$. (For $2$-torsion classes, one even sees it has to be ramified at an even number of $v$, but that is not relevant here). There is no obstruction to lifting away from the two places $p$ and $\\infty$ because unramified representations trivially lift. There is also no obstruction at the prime $p$, because $I_p = D_p = \\Z/3\\Z$, and $G_{\\Q_p} \\rightarrow \\Z/3\\Z \\rightarrow \\PSL_2(\\F_3)$ trivially lifts to $\\SL_2(\\F_3)$. Thus the only possible obstruction can occur at $\\infty$. But, by the observation above, the image of a non-trivial element of $\\Br(\\Q)$ must be ramified at at least two primes. Thus there is no local obstruction at $\\infty$ either. The result is immediate: if complex conjugation was non-trivial in $\\PSL_2(\\F_3)$, there would be a local obstruction at $\\infty$ since the lift of any order $2$ element in $\\PSL_2(\\F_3)$ to $\\SL_2(\\F_3)$ has order $4$, so a non-trivial map $\\Z/2\\Z = \\Gal(\\C/\\R) \\rightarrow \\PSL_2(\\F_3)$ cannot lift to $\\SL_2(\\F_3)$. Hence the $A_4$-extension is totally real, as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example they provided shows breaking down assumptions and stating the problem clearly. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is: \"$A_4$ extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ ramified at one prime\". The question asks how to show that an $A_4$-extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ ramified at only one prime must be totally real. \n\nNow, I need to filter out the unrelated information and structure it as per the example. The key here is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLet me start by identifying the assumptions. The problem is about an $A_4$-extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. So the first assumption is that there's a field extension with Galois group $A_4$. Then, it's specified that this extension is ramified at only one prime. So that's another assumption. Additionally, the base field is $\\mathbb{Q}$, so that's another point. The problem is to show that such an extension must be totally real. \n\nWait, does \"totally real\" add another assumption or is it part of the conclusion? Since the problem is to prove that the extension is totally real, that's the conclusion, not an assumption. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. There is a field extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $A_4$.\n2. The extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is ramified at only one prime.\n3. The base field is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBut wait, maybe the base field being $\\mathbb{Q}$ is given, so maybe that's part of the problem statement. Let me check the original question again: \"an $A_4$-extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ ramified at only one prime\". So the base field is $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $A_4$, and it's ramified at one prime. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- $K$ is a number field that is an $A_4$-extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n- The extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is ramified at only one prime.\n\nBut the problem is to show that $K$ must be totally real. So in the formatted problem, under assumptions, we list the conditions given. Each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. \n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: $K$ is an extension field of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nAssumption 2: The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to $A_4$.\n\nAssumption 3: The extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is ramified at only one prime.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that $K$ is totally real.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"A_4-extension\" already implies that it's a Galois extension with group $A_4$, so perhaps assumption 2 is redundant if we take \"A_4-extension\" to mean that. But in the example given, the user structured the problem with explicit assumptions. Let me check the example again. The original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumptions included \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem, it was \"for every integer $n$\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that $n$ is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then there shouldn't be an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Unless maybe the user made an error in their example. But regardless, following the instructions, the task is to filter the problem and structure the assumptions as per each condition. So in the current problem, the key points are that K is an A4-extension of Q, ramified at only one prime. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- K is a Galois extension of Q with Galois group A4.\n\n- K/Q is ramified at only one prime.\n\nThen the problem is to show that K is totally real.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"A4-extension\" already assumes it's Galois, so the first assumption is that K/Q is an A4-extension (hence Galois with group A4), and the second is that it's ramified at one prime. \n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group isomorphic to $A_4$,\nThe extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is ramified at only one prime.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $K$ is totally real.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The first line states the extension is Galois with group A4, the second states the ramification condition. The problem is to show total reality.",
