    "Content": "If X and Y are Banach spaces, and $A: X \\to Y$, $B: X \\to Y$ are both compact operators, then $A + B$ is compact. A + B is compact if and only if for every bounded sequence $\\lbrace x_n \\rbrace$ in X, the sequence $\\lbrace (A + B) x_n \\rbrace$ has a convergent subsequence; certainly both $\\lbrace A x_n \\rbrace$ and $\\lbrace B x_n \\rbrace$ each have a convergent subsequence, and I've seen a few proofs that seem to think it straightforward that this implies $\\lbrace (A + B) x_n \\rbrace$ has one. This doesn't seem quite right to me. The way it appears one should try to make a convergent subsequence is to intersect the indices of the convergent subsequences for A and B individually. So, for example, if $\\lbrace A x_{n_j} \\rbrace$ and $\\lbrace B x_{n_k} \\rbrace$, then the idea is to take the set of indices $\\lbrace n_m \\rbrace := \\lbrace n_j \\rbrace \\cap \\lbrace n_k \\rbrace$ and say that $\\lbrace (A + B) x_{n_m} \\rbrace$ converges as a sum of two further subsequences of the convergent subsequences for A and B. But what if that intersection is empty, for example if $\\lbrace n_j \\rbrace = 1, 3, 5, ...$ and $\\lbrace n_k \\rbrace = 2, 4, 6, ...$? Instinctively I would say \"if they're disjoint, just pick a different pair\", but how can one be sure that the intersection isn't empty for any chosen pair of convergent subsequences? To be clear, I believe that A + B is compact, it's this form of proof of the fact that seems dubious to me.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you have two sequences, say $\\{a_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\}$, and sufficiently neat conditions, then both have a convergent subsequence indexed by the same same set of indices. Formally, I mean that there exists a sequenece of integers $\\{n_1<n_2<n_3<\\cdots\\}$ such that both $\\{a_{n_i}\\}_{i=1}^\\infty$ and $\\{b_{n_i}\\}_{i=1}^\\infty$ both converge. To guarantee this, you're going to need either each of $\\{a_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\}$ lie in some compact set (even if they lie if different compact sets, it works); or each of $\\{a_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\}$ are bounded so you can apply some kind of Bolzano-Weierstrass. These amount to the same proof though. In fact, you can get this \"common subsequence trick\" far more generally: instead of two sequences $\\{a_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\}$, you can have countably many sequences $\\{a_n\\}$, $\\{b_n\\}$, $\\{c_n\\}$, $\\ldots$. It's the same proof. For two sequences it's actually very easy to write down. Let $\\{a_n\\}$ and $\\{b_n\\}$ be bounded, and say $\\{a_n\\}$ has convergent subsequence $\\{a_{n_i}\\}$. But then $\\{b_{n_i}\\}$ has a convergent subsequence because it is bounded --- say $\\{b_{n_{i_k}}\\}$ converges. But now $\\{a_{n_{i_k}}\\}$ is a subsequence of $\\{a_{n_i}\\}$, hence also convergent. Thus $\\{n_{i_1} < n_{i_2} < n_{i_3} < \\cdots\\}$ is the required set of indices. For the case with countably many sequences, you can imagine how to proceed. The hardest part is streamlining the notation. Do you see how to apply this to prove that the sum of two compact operators is compact?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is questioning a common proof that the sum of two compact operators is compact. The key point here is about sequences and convergent subsequences. \n\nFirst, the setup: X and Y are Banach spaces, and A, B are compact operators from X to Y. The user is concerned about the step where you take a bounded sequence {x_n}, then since A is compact, {A x_n} has a convergent subsequence {A x_{n_j}}. Similarly, B being compact gives a convergent subsequence {B x_{n_k}} from the original {x_n}. The idea in the proof is to intersect the indices of these two subsequences to get a common subsequence where both {A x_{n_m}} and {B x_{n_m}} converge, hence their sum does too.\n\nBut the user is pointing out a possible flaw: if the two convergent subsequences for A and B have completely disjoint indices (like odd and even), their intersection would be empty, making the argument invalid. So the problem is whether this method of intersecting indices always works or if there's a case where it fails.\n\nThe user isn't disputing that A+B is compact but is questioning the validity of this particular proof approach. They want to know if there's a way to ensure that such a common subsequence exists, avoiding the empty intersection issue.\n\nSo, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should include the conditions given: X and Y are Banach spaces, A and B are compact operators between them. The problem is to address the flaw in the proof method that relies on intersecting subsequences. The actual problem here is to either fix the proof or show that the concern is unfounded.\n\nWait, but in the example provided earlier, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, and the formatted version included assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the original question is about the validity of a proof step. So, how to frame the assumptions here?\n\nThe assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed. The user mentions that X and Y are Banach spaces, A and B are compact operators. So those are the key assumptions. The problem is then to address whether the given proof (using intersecting subsequences) is valid, considering the possibility that the intersection might be empty.\n\nBut the user is not asking to prove that A+B is compact, but rather to evaluate the validity of a specific proof approach. So the problem statement should reflect that.\n\nSo, following the example format, the assumptions would list the properties of the objects involved: X is a Banach space, Y is a Banach space, A is a compact operator from X to Y, B is a compact operator from X to Y. The problem is to determine if the given proof (using intersection of subsequence indices) is valid, considering the potential issue of empty intersection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to correctly prove that A+B is compact, addressing the flaw in the original approach. But the user states that they believe A+B is compact but the proof method is dubious. So the problem is more about the validity of the proof method rather than proving compactness itself.\n\nBut in the example given earlier, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, so in this case, maybe the problem is to \"Address the potential flaw in the proof that the sum of two compact operators is compact by considering the intersection of subsequence indices.\" However, the user's actual question is whether this method is valid, given the intersection might be empty.\n\nSo, to structure this properly:\n\nAssumptions:\n- X is a Banach space,\n- Y is a Banach space,\n- A: X → Y is a compact operator,\n- B: X → Y is a compact operator.\n\nProblem: Determine whether the argument that the sum A + B is compact, based on intersecting the indices of convergent subsequences of {A x_n} and {B x_n}, is valid, considering the possibility that such an intersection could be empty.\n\nBut maybe the user wants to frame the problem as proving that A+B is compact, but the core issue is the validity of the subsequence intersection method. Alternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Identify and resolve the flaw in the proof that the sum of two compact operators is compact by intersecting subsequence indices.\"\n\nBut the original question's title is \"Possible flaw in 'proof' that a sum of two compact operators is compact\", so the problem is about identifying if there's a flaw in that approach.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions (Banach spaces, A and B compact) and state the problem as evaluating the validity of that proof method.\n\nBut in the example provided, the problem was a statement to prove. Here, the problem is more of a critique of a proof method, but the format requires a \"Problem\" statement. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Determine whether the argument that the sum of two compact operators A and B is compact, by intersecting the indices of convergent subsequences of {A x_n} and {B x_n}, is valid.\n\nAlternatively, rephrase to match the example's structure, which was a directive like \"Prove that...\". Here, the user's issue is whether the proof is correct, so perhaps the problem is: \"Is the following proof valid? [Brief description of the proof method]. If not, explain the flaw and provide a correct proof.\"\n\nBut according to the original user's problem, the actual problem is to question the validity of the proof method. However, in the example, the formatted problem was a statement to prove. So maybe the problem here is to \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators A and B is compact, addressing the potential flaw in the subsequence intersection method.\"\n\nBut the original question is more about analyzing the proof's flaw rather than asking for a proof. So perhaps the problem should be phrased as: \"Identify the flaw in the argument that the sum of two compact operators is compact by intersecting subsequence indices and provide a correct proof.\"\n\nBut the user's exact question is: \"Possible flaw in 'proof' that a sum of two compact operators is compact. [...] This doesn't seem quite right to me. [...] how can one be sure that the intersection isn't empty [...]? [...] it's this form of proof of the fact that seems dubious to me.\"\n\nSo the problem is to examine the validity of this proof approach.\n\nBut the format requires the problem to be stated as a directive. Maybe:\n\nProblem: Evaluate the validity of the proof that the sum of two compact operators is compact by intersecting the indices of convergent subsequences, addressing the concern that the intersection may be empty.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be to \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators is compact, ensuring that the chosen subsequence indices for A and B have a non-empty intersection.\"\n\nBut the user is not asking to prove it but to analyze the proof's flaw. However, the example given in the prompt was a problem to prove something, so perhaps adapting it here.\n\nWait, the example had the original problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" and the formatted problem listed the assumptions and then the problem as \"Prove that...\". So here, perhaps the formatted problem would be to prove that A + B is compact, but the key is that the assumptions include the conditions (Banach spaces, A and B compact), and the problem is the original question, which is to address the flaw in the proof.\n\nBut the user's problem is not to prove the statement but to critique a proof. However, the format might require it to be a problem statement. Maybe in this case, the problem is to \"Identify and correct the flaw in the given proof that the sum of two compact operators is compact.\"\n\nBut the original question's problem is more precise: the flaw is in intersecting subsequence indices possibly being empty. So the problem is to address that specific step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is: \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators A and B is compact, ensuring that the convergent subsequences for A and B can be chosen with a common subsequence.\"\n\nBut this seems to combine the original problem and the user's concern.\n\nAlternatively, considering the example, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: X and Y are Banach spaces,\n\nAssumption: A: X → Y is a compact operator,\n\nAssumption: B: X → Y is a compact operator,\n\nProblem: Determine whether the argument that A + B is compact, based on intersecting the indices of convergent subsequences of {A x_n} and {B x_n}, is valid.\n\nBut the example had a problem statement starting with \"Prove that...\". However, the user here is not asking to prove but to evaluate a proof's validity. Since the format seems to require a problem statement, perhaps it's phrased as \"Determine the validity of the proof that A + B is compact by intersecting subsequence indices.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the user's question is about the potential flaw, maybe the problem is: \"Address the concern that intersecting subsequence indices may be empty in the proof that A + B is compact.\"\n\nBut the exact problem structure needs to be concise. Given the original example, the problem line was a statement to prove. Here, perhaps the problem is to \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators is compact, ensuring the existence of a common convergent subsequence.\"\n\nBut the user's core issue is whether the method of intersecting indices is valid. So the problem is to justify that step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is: \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators is compact by showing that for any bounded sequence, there exists a common subsequence for which both A and B converge.\"\n\nIn that case, the problem is to provide a correct proof that overcomes the user's concern.\n\nBut the user's original problem is not to ask for a proof but to question a specific step. However, since the example format is about structuring the problem (not the answer), perhaps the problem statement here is: \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators is compact, addressing the potential flaw in intersecting subsequence indices.\"\n\nBut I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem according to the given format. The original problem on Math Stack Exchange is about identifying a possible flaw in the proof. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions (X, Y Banach spaces; A, B compact operators) and the problem as evaluating the proof's validity regarding subsequence intersection.\n\nBut the example given was a problem to prove something, so perhaps here the problem is to \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators is compact, ensuring the existence of a common subsequence for convergence.\" But the user's concern is about the method's validity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to \"Identify the flaw in the given proof that the sum of two compact operators is compact and correct it.\"\n\nBut the example's problem was a statement to prove. Since the user's original question is about the validity of the proof method, perhaps the problem is phrased as: \"Evaluate the validity of the proof that the sum of two compact operators is compact by intersecting subsequences, considering the possibility of empty intersection.\"\n\nBut how to fit that into the example's structure. The example's problem was \"Prove that...\", but here it's more of a critique. However, given the format, I think the problem line should be a directive, like \"Prove that...\" or \"Show that...\", but in this case, the user is questioning the proof method, so the problem could be \"Show that the sum of two compact operators is compact, addressing the concern that intersecting subsequences may have empty intersection.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to \"Demonstrate that the sum of two compact operators is compact without relying on intersecting subsequence indices.\"\n\nBut that's not exactly what the user is asking. The user wants to know if the intersecting subsequence method is valid despite the potential empty intersection. So the problem is to show that the method is valid by ensuring a common subsequence exists.\n\nAh, the key here is that when you take a subsequence for A, then apply B to that subsequence, you can extract a further subsequence where B converges. So the correct approach is not to take two separate subsequences and intersect them, but to take a subsequence for A, then from that subsequence, take a sub-subsequence for B. This way, you have a common subsequence where both A and B converge.\n\nTherefore, the flaw in the original proof is that they take two separate subsequences and intersect them, which may not work. The correct method is to diagonalize: first take a subsequence where A converges, then from that subsequence, take a sub-subsequence where B converges. Then the sum will converge.\n\nSo the problem here is that the original proof's method is incorrect, and the correct approach requires taking a subsequence for one operator, then a sub-subsequence for the other. Therefore, the problem is to identify this flaw and provide the correct argument.\n\nBut how to structure this in the given format. The assumptions would be the Banach spaces and compact operators. The problem is to address the flaw in the proof method regarding intersecting subsequences.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: X is a Banach space,\nAssumption: Y is a Banach space,\nAssumption: A: X → Y is a compact operator,\nAssumption: B: X → Y is a compact operator,\nProblem: Identify the flaw in the argument that the sum A + B is compact by intersecting the indices of convergent subsequences for A and B, and provide a valid proof.\n\nBut the example's problem line was a statement to prove. Perhaps here, since the original question is about the validity of the proof, the problem is phrased as: \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators is compact, addressing the potential flaw in intersecting subsequence indices.\"\n\nAlternatively, following the example's structure, where the problem was to prove a statement, here the problem could be to \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators is compact,\" with the assumptions listed, but the user's concern is about the method. However, the example included an additional assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait the example says:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless maybe there was a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. Unless perhaps the original problem had a different condition, but in the example provided, it's stated as \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow that format regardless.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the current problem should follow the example's style, even if the example had an error. So in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption. That might be an error, but following that, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions should list all the given conditions, even if they are part of the problem's premise.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states that X and Y are Banach spaces, A and B are compact operators. So those are the assumptions. The problem is to evaluate the proof's validity.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem's assumptions include conditions from the original problem (n is an integer) and added an extra one (n divisible by 7). Wait, that seems incorrect. Maybe the example was a bad example. Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so n is an integer is part of the universal quantification, not an assumption. But the formatted problem lists it as an assumption and adds another assumption (n divisible by 7), which changes the problem.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to list all the given conditions in the problem, even if they are part of the universal statement. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: X is a Banach space,\nAssumption: Y is a Banach space,\nAssumption: A: X → Y is a compact operator,\nAssumption: B: X → Y is a compact operator.\n\nProblem: Prove that A + B is a compact operator, addressing the validity of the argument based on intersecting subsequence indices.\n\nBut the user's actual problem is to question the proof method, not to prove the statement. However, following the example's structure, where the problem is phrased as a directive (Prove that...), even if the original question was about a possible flaw, perhaps here the problem is structured as \"Prove that A + B is compact, considering the concern about intersecting subsequence indices.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is: \"Prove that the sum of two compact operators is compact, ensuring the existence of a common convergent subsequence.\"\n\nBut I think the key here is to list all the given conditions as assumptions and then state the problem as per the user's concern. The user's problem is not to prove compactness but to evaluate a specific proof step. However, according to the example, the problem line is a statement to prove, even if the original question was about divisibility without extra assumptions. So perhaps the example is flawed, but we have to follow it.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a Banach space,\n- Y is a Banach space,\n- A: X → Y is a compact operator,\n- B: X → Y is a compact operator.\n\nProblem: Prove that A + B is a compact operator, considering the concern that intersecting indices of convergent subsequences may be empty.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is pointing out a flaw in the proof method, perhaps the problem is to \"Identify the flaw in the proof that A + B is compact by intersecting subsequences and provide a correct argument.\"\n\nBut the example's problem line was a statement to prove. Given that, perhaps the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: X is a Banach space,\nAssumption: Y is a Banach space,\nAssumption: A: X → Y is a compact operator,\nAssumption: B: X → Y is a compact operator,\nProblem: Prove that A + B is a compact operator, addressing the validity of intersecting subsequence indices in the proof.",
