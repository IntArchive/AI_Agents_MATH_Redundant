    "Content": "Suppose I have a sequence defined via its first term and a recurrence relation involving summation over all previous values with some coefficients. Here is the sequence I am interested in right now (although I would like to find a general method applicable to other sequences as well, if possible): $$a_0=1,\\quad a_n=\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\frac{a_k}{(n-k+1)!\\,(2^n-1)}.\\tag1$$ This sequence is positive rational, monotone decreasing, decaying faster than exponentially, with a few initial terms: $$1,\\,\\frac12,\\,\\frac5{36},\\,\\frac1{36},\\,\\frac{143}{32400},\\,\\frac{19}{32400},\\,\\frac{1153}{17146080},\\,\\frac{583}{857\n   30400},\\,\\dots\\tag2$$ It is related to values of the Fabius function . I'm interested in its asymptotic expansion for $n\\to\\infty$ . Using empirical numeric methods, and with some luck, I came to this conjecture: $$\\log_2a_n\\stackrel{\\color{#aaaaaa}?}=-n \\log_2n+\\frac{n}{\\log2}-\\frac{\\log _2^2n}{2} +\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2 \\log ^22}-\\frac{2}{\\log2}\\right)+\\mathcal O\\!\\left(\\frac{\\log^2n}{n}\\right)\\!.\\tag3$$ Could you suggest a way to prove it and find a few next terms of this asymptotic expansion? How should I approach problems like this in general? Update: The sequence in question is directly connected to the values of the Fabius function at negative integer powers of two: $$F\\!\\left(2^{-n}\\right)=2^{-\\binom n2}a_n.\\tag4$$ There is also a direct non-recursive formula for it (conjectured): $$a_n\\stackrel{\\color{#aaaaaa}?}=\\frac{(-1)^n}{(2;2)_n}\\sum_{k=0}^n\\frac{\\binom n k_2}{2^{(n-1)k}(n+k)!}\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{2^k-1}(-1)^{\\sigma_2(\\ell)}\\left(\\ell-2^k+\\tfrac12\\right)^{n+k},\\tag5$$ where $\\left(q;q\\right)_n=\\prod_{k=1}^n\\!\\left(1-q^k\\right)$ is the q ‑Pochhammer symbol , ${\\binom n k}_q=\\frac{\\left(q;q\\right)_n}{\\left(q;q\\right)_k\\,\\left(q;q\\right)_{n-k}}$ is the q ‑binomial coefficient , and $\\sigma_2(\\ell)$ is the sum of binary digits of $\\ell$ ; note that $(-1)^{\\sigma_2\\left(\\ell\\right)}$ is just the signed version of the Thue–Morse sequence .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following might help, but it's not a complete solution. The coefficients $a_n$ have an alternative expression, where the $B_n$ are the Bernoulli numbers: $$ \\tag{1} a_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k a_k \\  \\frac{B_{n-k}}{(n-k)!} $$ To prove $(1)$ , start with the recursion given in the problem statement, flip the direction of summation, and pull the $a_n$ term into the sum to get $$2^n a_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{1}{k+1} \\binom{n}{k} a_{n-k} \\frac{(n-k)!}{n!} $$ Set $c_{n} = n!a_n$ so that $$2^n a_n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{1}{k+1} \\binom{n}{k} c_{n-k} $$ This equation is invertible, e.g. Binomial Transform of a Particular Binomial Sum Reverting back to $a_n$ gives the formula $(1)$ . Define a generating function $f(x) =\\sum_{n \\ge 0} a_n x^n$ . Then $(1)$ implies the functional equation $$ \\tag{2} \\quad f(x) = f(2x) \\frac{x}{e^x -1} $$ Iterate on $(2)$ , and formally the solution is $$ \\tag{3} \\quad f(x) = \\prod_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{ \\exp{\\big(x \\ 2^{-k-1}\\big)} - 1}{x \\ 2^{-k-1} } $$ I've calculated many of the $a_n$ and checked that $(3)$ is satisfied numerically when the product is truncated and $x$ is sufficiently small. $(3)$ looks like a formidable equation to do asymptotic analysis on. $(2)$ looks like a trick with a Mellin transform might be advantageous. The closest thing I know of that looks like the proposed asymptotic expansion has to do with Rice integrals, and instead of Bernoulli numbers, binomials appear in the sum. See example $4$ in $[1]$ . Edit 1/13/2022. Summary : the asymptotics of $a_n$ can be approximated by a saddle point analysis of the large $x$ asymptotics of $f(x)$ given above.  Here is a short algorithm for calculation: $$ \\tag{4} x_0=-\\frac{1}{\\log{2}}W_{-1}\\big( -\\log{2} \\cdot 2^{-n} \\big) $$ $$ \\tag{5} C=2^{-1/12}\\exp{\\Big(\\big( \\gamma_1 + \\gamma^2/2-\\pi^2/12 \\big) }/\\log{2} \\Big) $$ $$ \\tag{6} F(x)=C\\sqrt{x}\\exp{\\big(x -\\frac{1}{2 \\log{2}}\\log^2 x \\big)}$$ $$b(x)=x \\frac{d}{dx}(x \\frac{d}{dx} \\log{(F(x)} ) $$ $$\\tag{7} a_n^{A} \\sim (2 \\pi b(x_0))^{-1/2} F(x_0) x_0^{-n} $$ Notation: $W_{-1}(x)$ is the Lambert W function on the '-1 branch' and is implemented in Mathematica as ProductLog[-1,x]. The $\\gamma$ is Euler's constant and $\\gamma_1$ is the first Stieltjes constant, $\\gamma_1 \\approx$ -0.0728158. Here is a table comparing the true $a_n,$ the approximation (above) $a_n^{A},$ and the proposed approximation, $a_n^{P} = 2^{ (eq.3)}$ where eq. 3 corresponds to that in the proposers write up. $$\n\\begin{array}{c|lcr}\nn & a_n & a_n^{A} & a_n^{P} \\quad \\\\\n\\hline\n20 & 6.08905 \\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-22} & 6.07191\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-22} & 9.3967\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-22}  \\\\\n40 & 1.00137 \\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-52}& 1.00047\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-52} & 1.3980\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-52}  \\\\\n60 & 1.30647\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-87} & 1.30565\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-87} & 1.7222\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-87}  \\\\\n80 & 3.13549\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-125} & 3.13398\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-125} & 3.9804\\,\\cdot\\, 10^{-125} \n\\end{array}\n$$ The approximation $a_n^{A}$ is excellent, about 3 significant digits for $n=20,$ and about 4 digits for $n=80.$ A comment before sketching the proof.  The proposer's solution seems to have missed the constant, and otherwise the expansion seems to be an asymptotic expansion of the Lambert W function, $$ W(x) \\sim \\log{x} - \\log{\\log{x}} + \\cdots $$ The first part of the proof is to show that, for large $x$ $$ \\tag{4} \\quad f(x) = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{ \\exp{\\big(x \\ 2^{-k}\\big)} - 1}{x \\ 2^{-k} } \n\\sim F(x)\\exp{\\big(P(x) \\big)}\n$$ where $F(x)$ is given by eqs. (5) & (6) and $P(x)$ is given by $$P(x)=\\sum_{k=-\\infty, k \\ne 0}^\\infty\\ \\frac{1}{2\\pi i k}\\Gamma\\big(1-\\frac{2 \\pi i k}{\\log2} \\big)\n\\zeta\\big(1-\\frac{2 \\pi i k}{\\log2} \\big) \\exp{\\big(x  \\, \\frac{2 \\pi i k}{\\log2} \\big)}.$$ The formulas presented are a slight modification of that presented in Example 9.3 in reference [2].  We are going to ignore $P(x),$ in subsequent analysis, mainly because the amplitudes of the oscillations are tiny, with magnitudes of $7.4\\,\\cdot\\,10^{-7}, 4.4\\,\\cdot\\,10^{-13}\\cdots$ for $k=1,2...$ However, if you want even more precise asymptotics (3 or 4 digits is not enough?) then they have to be included. Reference [2] deals with a problem that has the functional equation $$ g(x) = g(2x)\\frac{x}{1-e^{-x}} $$ Note how close that is to the functional equation in (3).  On taking logarithms we have $$\\log{\\big(f(x)\\big)} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\log{\\Big(\n\\frac{ \\exp{\\big(x \\ 2^{-k}\\big)} - 1}{x \\ 2^{-k} } \\Big) }\n$$ $$ = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\log{\\Big(\\exp{\\big(x \\ 2^{-k}\\big)}\\Big) } + \\log{\\Big(\n\\frac{ 1-\\exp{\\big(-x \\ 2^{-k}\\big)} }{x \\ 2^{-k} } \\Big) }\n$$ $$=x+ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\log{\\Big(\n\\frac{ 1-\\exp{\\big(-x \\ 2^{-k}\\big)} }{x \\ 2^{-k} } \\Big) }$$ The infinite sum is precisely that given in ref. [2] for $g(x)$ , so its asymptotics can be copied verbatim, which I have done. Very briefly, the technique is to find the Mellin transform for the sum, then find the asymptotics by moving the contour of integration over the function's singularities.  Later on, the reference extracts the asymptotics for the coefficients of $g(x)$ by using a process called dePoissionization, but that requires a growth restriction on the function. The addition of $e^x$ for my $f(x)$ destroys that possibility.  However, traditional saddle point works.  In that situation, one can use eq. (7) for a generic function $F(x).$ How does one determine the saddle point?  Look at the Cauchy representation of $a_n,$ $$ a_n = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\oint \\frac{F(x)}{x^{n+1}} dx$$ $$ \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\oint \\exp{\\big( x - n\\log{x} - \\frac{1}{2 \\log{2}}\\log^2{x} \\big)} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{x}}\n$$ The saddle point $x0$ is that in which the derivative of the argument of the exponential is zero, $$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\big(x - n\\log{x} - \\frac{1}{2 \\log{2}}\\log^2{x}  \\big)\\overset{!}{=} 0 $$ The solution to this equation for $x=x_0$ is given in eq.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user is asking about finding an asymptotic expansion for a sequence defined by a recurrence relation. The sequence starts with a_0 = 1, and each subsequent term is a sum over all previous terms divided by some coefficients involving factorials and 2^n -1. They provided some initial terms and a conjecture for the asymptotic behavior of log base 2 of a_n. They also mentioned a connection to the Fabius function and a non-recursive formula, but I need to focus on the main problem.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states the sequence is defined by a recurrence relation: a_0=1, and for n ≥1, a_n is the sum from k=0 to n-1 of a_k divided by (n -k +1)! times (2^n -1). The sequence is positive, rational, monotone decreasing, and decays faster than exponentially. They want the asymptotic expansion as n approaches infinity of log_2 a_n. The conjecture given is a specific expansion with several terms and an error term. The user also asks for a general method for such problems.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions should each address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- a_0 = 1.\n- For n ≥ 1, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [a_k / ((n - k + 1)! (2^n - 1))].\n- The sequence a_n is positive.\n- The sequence a_n is rational.\n- The sequence a_n is monotone decreasing.\n- The sequence a_n decays faster than exponentially.\n- The problem seeks the asymptotic expansion of log_2 a_n as n → ∞.\n- A conjecture for the asymptotic expansion is provided: log_2 a_n ≈ -n log_2 n + n / log 2 - (log_2^2 n)/2 + [1 - 1/(2 log^2 2) - 2/log 2] + O(log² n / n).\n- The sequence is connected to the Fabius function at negative integer powers of two: F(2^{-n}) = 2^{-n(n-1)/2} a_n.\n- A non-recursive formula is conjectured for a_n involving q-Pochhammer symbols, q-binomial coefficients, and sums over binary digits.\n\nWait, but the problem statement mentions these connections and conjectures. However, when structuring the problem, should I include all of them as assumptions? The task is to filter unrelated information. The main problem is to prove the asymptotic expansion. The connection to the Fabius function and the non-recursive formula might be additional context but perhaps not essential assumptions. However, since the user mentions the connection (equation 4), maybe that's part of the problem's given conditions. But the problem is to find the asymptotic of a_n as defined by the recurrence. The non-recursive formula is a conjecture, so maybe it's not an assumption unless required for solving. The user is asking how to approach such problems in general, but the specific problem is about this sequence.\n\nSo, to list the necessary assumptions for the problem:\n\n- The sequence is defined by a_0 = 1 and the recurrence a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [a_k / ((n - k +1)! (2^n -1))] for n ≥1.\n- The sequence is positive, rational, monotone decreasing, decays faster than exponentially.\n- The goal is to find the asymptotic expansion of log_2 a_n as n → ∞.\n- A specific conjecture for the expansion is given, which needs to be proven.\n\nPossibly also the connection to the Fabius function if that's part of the given conditions, but since equation (4) is presented as a connection, not a definition, perhaps it's extra information. The problem is about the sequence defined by the recurrence, so the main assumptions are the recurrence relation and the properties of the sequence. The rest might be additional context but not assumptions needed to state the problem. However, the user mentions that the sequence is related to the Fabius function, so maybe that's an important condition. Wait, but the problem is to prove the asymptotic for the sequence defined by (1). The connection to Fabius function is perhaps a motivation, but not a part of the problem's assumptions. Similarly, the non-recursive formula is a conjecture, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- a_0 = 1.\n- For all n ≥ 1, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [a_k / ((n -k +1)! (2^n -1))].\n- The sequence a_n is positive rational.\n- The sequence a_n is monotone decreasing.\n- The sequence a_n decays faster than exponentially.\n- The problem is to find the asymptotic expansion of log_2 a_n as n → ∞.\n\nBut the user's conjecture is part of the problem statement; they want to prove this conjecture. So the problem is to prove that log_2 a_n has the given asymptotic expansion. Therefore, the assumptions include the recurrence, initial condition, properties of the sequence, and the conjecture is the target to prove.\n\nWait, but the example given in the user's instruction includes in the assumptions the divisibility by 7, which was in the original problem. So perhaps any given conditions in the problem statement should be listed as assumptions. Therefore, in this case:\n\nAssumptions:\n- a_0 = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, a_n is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [a_k / ((n - k + 1)! (2^n - 1))].\n- The sequence {a_n} consists of positive rational numbers.\n- The sequence {a_n} is monotone decreasing.\n- The sequence {a_n} decays faster than exponentially.\n- The problem seeks the asymptotic expansion of log_2 a_n as n approaches infinity.\n- A conjectured asymptotic expansion for log_2 a_n is provided: log_2 a_n = -n log_2 n + n / log 2 - (log_2^2 n)/2 + [1 - 1/(2 log^2 2) - 2/log 2] + O(log² n / n).\n\nAdditionally, the connection to the Fabius function and the non-recursive formula might be considered as related context but perhaps not primary assumptions needed to state the problem. However, the user mentions equation (4): F(2^{-n}) = 2^{-binom(n,2)} a_n. If this is a given relation that might be useful, it's part of the problem's context. But if the problem is purely about the recurrence-defined sequence, then maybe it's extra. The problem states \"the sequence in question is directly connected...\" so perhaps that is an additional assumption given in the problem. Therefore, the connection to Fabius function is part of the problem's given information.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Update: The sequence in question is directly connected...\". In the original problem statement, the user added this as an update. So in the problem, they have this relation as part of the problem's data. Therefore, this connection is part of the given information. Similarly, the non-recursive formula is a conjecture, but the user is providing it as part of the problem's context. However, since the main task is to prove the asymptotic expansion, maybe the Fabius function connection is an additional assumption that might be useful. But the user is asking to prove the asymptotic for the sequence defined by (1), which is the recurrence. The connection to Fabius function is perhaps supplementary. So, to decide whether to include equation (4) as an assumption.\n\nThe problem says: \"the sequence in question is directly connected to the values of the Fabius function at negative integer powers of two: F(2^{-n}) = 2^{-binom(n,2)} a_n.\" So this is a given equation that relates the sequence to the Fabius function. If this is part of the problem's given data, then it's an assumption. But if the problem is only about the recurrence relation, then it's extra. However, the user mentions this connection as part of the problem statement, so it's part of the problem's context. Therefore, it's an assumption. Similarly, the non-recursive formula (5) is a conjecture, so it's not an assumption but something the user is mentioning as possibly helpful. Since the user is asking to prove the asymptotic, which is conjectured based on numerical methods and this connection, but the problem is still about the recurrence-defined sequence. However, equation (4) is presented as a direct connection, so it's part of the problem's given data.\n\nSo the assumptions should include:\n\n- The sequence {a_n} is connected to the Fabius function such that F(2^{-n}) = 2^{-n(n-1)/2} a_n.\n\nBut is this necessary for stating the problem? The original problem is to find the asymptotic of a_n defined by the recurrence. The connection to Fabius function might be a property or an additional condition. The user is providing this as part of the problem statement, so it's an assumption. Therefore, include it.\n\nSimilarly, the conjectured non-recursive formula (5) is presented but it's a conjecture, so it's not an assumption. The user is asking to prove the asymptotic, possibly using this formula if needed, but it's not a given condition. So it's not part of the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- a_0 = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [a_k / ((n - k + 1)! (2^n - 1))].\n- The sequence {a_n} consists of positive rational numbers.\n- The sequence {a_n} is monotone decreasing.\n- The sequence {a_n} decays faster than exponentially.\n- The sequence {a_n} is connected to the Fabius function via F(2^{-n}) = 2^{-n(n-1)/2} a_n.\n- The problem requires finding the asymptotic expansion of log_2 a_n as n → ∞.\n- A conjectured asymptotic expansion for log_2 a_n is provided.\n\nBut wait, each assumption should address only one property. So splitting them:\n\nAssumption:\n- a_0 = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [a_k / ((n - k + 1)! (2^n - 1))].\n- The sequence {a_n} is positive.\n- The sequence {a_n} consists of rational numbers.\n- The sequence {a_n} is monotone decreasing.\n- The sequence {a_n} decays faster than exponentially.\n- The Fabius function satisfies F(2^{-n}) = 2^{-n(n-1)/2} a_n.\n- The goal is to find the asymptotic expansion of log_2 a_n as n approaches infinity.\n- The conjectured asymptotic expansion is log_2 a_n = -n log_2 n + n / log 2 - (log_2^2 n)/2 + [1 - 1/(2 log^2 2) - 2/log 2] + O(log² n / n).\n\nBut in the example, the user included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original. Wait, no: in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", but that seems incorrect. Wait, the example given by the user might be a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait the original example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem doesn't restrict n to be divisible by 7; it's for all integers n. So in that case, the assumption should not include that n is divisible by 7. Perhaps the example is wrong. Therefore, the instruction might have an error. But the task is to follow the format, so maybe the example is correct as per their structure, even if it's wrong. Therefore, in their example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, perhaps to illustrate. But in our case, we need to be accurate.\n\nSo returning to the current problem. The original problem says that the sequence is defined by the recurrence (1), has properties (2), and the goal is to prove the asymptotic (3). The connection to Fabius function (4) is given as part of the problem's context. Therefore, the assumptions should include all given conditions: the recurrence, the properties of the sequence (positive, rational, decreasing, fast decay), the connection to Fabius function, and the conjectured asymptotic.\n\nBut each assumption must address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- a_0 = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, a_n is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [a_k / ((n - k + 1)! (2^n - 1))].\n- The sequence {a_n} consists of positive rational numbers.\n- The sequence {a_n} is monotone decreasing.\n- The sequence {a_n} decays faster than exponentially.\n- The Fabius function satisfies F(2^{-n}) = 2^{-n(n-1)/2} a_n for all integers n ≥ 0.\n- A conjectured asymptotic expansion for log_2 a_n as n → ∞ is log_2 a_n = -n log_2 n + n / log 2 - (log_2^2 n)/2 + [1 - 1/(2 log^2 2) - 2/log 2] + O(log² n / n).\n\nProblem:\nProve the conjectured asymptotic expansion for log_2 a_n as n → ∞ and find the next few terms of the expansion. Additionally, suggest a general method for approaching similar problems involving asymptotic analysis of sequences defined by recurrence relations.\n\nBut the user's original problem is: \"Could you suggest a way to prove it and find a few next terms of this asymptotic expansion? How should I approach problems like this in general?\" So the problem is two-fold: prove the conjecture, find next terms, and suggest a general method.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement should encapsulate all that. However, the example provided by the user in their instruction includes a problem statement that is a single sentence. So to follow the format:\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequence {a_n} defined by the recurrence a_0=1 and a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [a_k / ((n -k +1)! (2^n -1))] has the asymptotic expansion log_2 a_n = -n log_2 n + n / log 2 - (log_2^2 n)/2 + [1 - 1/(2 log^2 2) - 2/log 2] + O(log² n / n) as n → ∞, find the next few terms of this expansion, and suggest a general method for such problems.\n\nBut need to make this concise. The original problem in the example had the problem statement as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So similarly, here the problem would be to prove the asymptotic, find next terms, and suggest a general approach. But the problem statement should be a single sentence. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\" which includes the problem part. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that the asymptotic expansion of log_2 a_n as n → ∞ is given by $$\\log_2a_n= -n \\log_2n+\\frac{n}{\\log2}-\\frac{\\log _2^2n}{2} +\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2 \\log ^22}-\\frac{2}{\\log2}\\right)+\\mathcal O\\!\\left(\\frac{\\log^2n}{n}\\right)\\!,$$ find the next terms of this expansion, and suggest a general method for similar problems.\n\nThis captures all parts of the problem: proving the conjecture, extending it, and the general approach.\n\nTherefore, compiling all the assumptions as single properties:\n\nAssumption:\n- a_0 = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [a_k / ((n - k +1)!
