    "AcceptedAnswer": "Another Solution could be as follows: It's a double counting of the surjective functions from the set $\\{1,\\dots,j\\}$ to the set $\\{1,\\dots, p\\}$. On one hand, clearly these functions are $p!$ if $j=p$, while there are no such functions if $j<p$. Let's count these functions in a different way: For $1\\leq i\\leq p$ let us define the sets $$A_i:=\\{\\text{the functions from }\\{1,\\dots,j\\}\\text{ to }\\{1,\\dots,p\\}\\text{ which doesn't contain }\\; i\\;\\text{ in their image}\\}.$$ We have then $$\\begin{align}\n|A_i|&=(p-1)^j\\\\\n|A_i\\cap A_l|&=(p-2)^j\\\\\n&\\vdots&\\\\\n\\left|\\bigcap_{i=1}^p A_i\\right|&=0.\\end{align}$$ We are interested in calculate the following: $$|\\overline{A_1}\\cap\\overline{A_2}\\cap\\dots\\cap\\overline{A_p}|=|\\overline{A_1\\cup A_2 \\cup\\dots\\cup A_p}|= p^j-|A_1\\cup A_2 \\cup\\dots\\cup A_p|=\n$$ \n$$p^j-\\sum_{i=1}^p\\left((-1)^{i+1}\\sum_{1\\leq j_1<\\dots<j_i\\leq p}\\left|\\bigcap_{k=1}^i A_{j_k}\\right|\\right)=\\sum_{k=0}^p(-1)^{p+k}\\binom{p}{k}k^j.$$ From which the thesis follows. EDIT Since I spent a lot of time on this problem a year ago, I would like to give two other pennies on the topic, and I would give another solution, or at least a sketch of it: So, let us consider the differential operator which realizes: $$D(f(x)) = \\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm dx}(x\\cdot f(x)) = f(x) + x\\cdot\\frac{\\mathrm df}{\\mathrm dx}.$$ Immediately one sees that $$D(x^m)=m\\cdot x^m,$$ hence $$\\sum_{k=0}^{p}(-1)^k \\binom{p}{k}\\,k^j = \\left.D^j\\left((1-x)^p\\right)\\right|_{x=1}.$$ So, (almost) immediately, again the thesis follows. Let me say one last thing. This formula is strictly related to Stirling numbers of the second kind , but note how the second proof I gave you does not say much on what happens if $j>p$, while the first fits perfectly even in this situation.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove two summation identities involving binomial coefficients and powers. The first part is that the sum from i=0 to p of (-1)^(p-i) times C(p,i) times i^j equals zero when j is between 0 and p-1, and equals p! when j equals p. \n\nFirst, I need to recall similar identities. This reminds me of the principle of inclusion-exclusion or maybe generating functions. Also, the presence of binomial coefficients with alternating signs suggests something related to finite differences. Let me think about finite differences. The k-th finite difference of a function can be expressed as a sum with binomial coefficients and alternating signs. Specifically, the k-th difference of a function f at 0 is sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^{k-i} C(k,i) f(i). If we take f(i) = i^j, then this sum is the k-th difference of f at 0.\n\nNow, I remember that the k-th finite difference of a polynomial of degree less than k is zero. And if the polynomial is of degree exactly k, the finite difference is k! times the leading coefficient. Since i^j is a polynomial of degree j, when j < p, the p-th finite difference should be zero. When j = p, the p-th finite difference should be p! because the leading coefficient is 1. That seems to match exactly the given problem. So the key idea here is connecting the sum to finite differences.\n\nAlternatively, another approach might use generating functions. Let's consider generating functions. The generating function for the sum would be sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i) i^j. Maybe expanding this using generating functions or exponential generating functions. However, the finite difference approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother thought: the hint mentions Cramer's system of equations. The system is given by 0^j x_0 + 1^j x_1 + ... + p^j x_p = p! delta_{j,p} for j from 0 to p. The solution is x_i = (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i). If that's the case, then substituting x_i into the equations would give the desired result. Specifically, for each j, sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i) i^j equals p! when j=p and 0 otherwise. This aligns with the problem statement, so maybe proving that the x_i solve the system would establish the identities.\n\nBut how do we show that the solution is indeed x_i = (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i)? This might involve linear algebra. The system of equations is a Vandermonde system? Since the coefficients are i^j, which form a Vandermonde matrix when considering different i and j. But since the variables are x_i and the equations are over j, it might be a transpose of a Vandermonde matrix. However, solving such systems usually relates to interpolation. Alternatively, recognizing that the matrix of coefficients is related to the moments of the basis functions i^j. \n\nAlternatively, considering the system as a set of linear equations where we need to solve for x_i such that sum_{i} x_i i^j = p! delta_{j,p}. This resembles dual basis functions. The x_i can be thought of as coefficients that pick out the p-th moment. Using the properties of binomial coefficients and inclusion-exclusion, perhaps the solution x_i are the coefficients obtained from expanding certain products.\n\nWait, another angle: the system of equations can be represented as a matrix equation. Let M be a (p+1)x(p+1) matrix where M_{ji} = i^j for i, j from 0 to p. Then the equation is Mx = b, where b is a vector with p! in the p-th position and zero elsewhere. If we can invert M, then x = M^{-1} b. However, inverting M directly is complicated, but maybe there's a connection here with the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix, which is known to involve coefficients with alternating signs and binomial coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, using linear algebra properties. The equations for j=0 to p would determine the x_i uniquely since the Vandermonde matrix is invertible when the i's are distinct. So, if we can verify that x_i = (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i) satisfies the equation, then that's sufficient. Let's check for j=0: sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i) i^0 = sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i). That's equal to (1 - 1)^p = 0 by the binomial theorem. But according to the system, when j=0, the right-hand side is 0 (since delta_{0,p} is 0 unless p=0). So that's good. For j=1: sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i) i. That's similar to evaluating the finite difference. Similarly, for j=p, sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i) i^p should equal p!. \n\nAlternatively, consider generating functions. Let’s consider the generating function sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i) i^j. For each j, this is equivalent to applying the operator (x d/dx)^j to the generating function sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i) x^i, evaluated at x=1. The generating function sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i) x^i is equal to (x - 1)^p. Then applying (x d/dx)^j to (x - 1)^p and evaluating at x=1. For j < p, the operator (x d/dx)^j applied to (x - 1)^p would result in a term that still has (x - 1)^{p - j} when expanded, so evaluating at x=1 would give zero. For j = p, applying the operator p times would give p! (x - 1)^0 times the leading coefficient, which is 1, so evaluated at x=1 gives p!. That seems to work. Therefore, this generating function approach confirms the result.\n\nSo, summarizing, using generating functions or finite differences, we can see that the sum is the p-th finite difference of the function f(i) = i^j evaluated at 0. For j < p, this difference is zero, and for j = p, it's p!.\n\nAlternatively, using the hint provided with the system of equations: if we set up the equations as given, and if the solution is x_i = (-1)^{p-i} C(p,i), then substituting back into the equations should yield the desired results. Since the equations are designed such that for each j from 0 to p, sum x_i i^j = p! delta_{j,p}, then for j < p, the sum is zero, and for j=p, it's p!.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be approached using finite differences, generating functions, or linear algebra (solving the system of equations). Each method connects to the given identities and provides a pathway to the proof.",
