    "AcceptedAnswer": "What you have written is only correct if you are referring to the left nullspace (it is more standard to use the term \"nullspace\" to refer to the right nullspace). The row space (not the column space) is orthogonal to the right null space. Showing that row space is orthogonal to the right null space follows directly from the definition of right null space. Let the matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$. The right null space is defined as $$\\mathcal{N}(A) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1} : Az = 0 \\}$$ Let $\nA =\n\\left[ {\\begin{array}{c}\n a_1^T \\\\\n a_2^T \\\\\n \\ldots \\\\\n \\ldots \\\\\n a_m^T\n \\end{array} } \\right]$. The row space of $A$ is defined as\n$$\\mathcal{R}(A) = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}: y = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_i x_i \\text{ , where }x_i \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and }a_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1} \\}$$\nNow from the definition of right null space we have $a_i^T z = 0$. So if we take a $y \\in \\mathcal{R}(A)$, then $y = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^m a_i x_i \\text{ , where }x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Hence, $$y^Tz = (\\sum_{k=1}^m a_i x_i)^T z =  (\\sum_{k=1}^m x_i a_i^T) z = \\sum_{k=1}^m x_i (a_i^T z) = 0$$ This proves that row space is orthogonal to the right null space. A similar analysis proves that column space of $A$ is orthogonal to the left null space of $A$. Note : The left null space is defined as $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times 1}: z^TA = 0\\}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the column space of a matrix A is orthogonal to its nullspace. Hmm, first, I need to recall some linear algebra concepts. \n\nSo, the column space of A, denoted as Col(A), is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of A. The nullspace of A, Null(A), consists of all vectors x such that Ax = 0. The question is about proving that these two spaces are orthogonal. Orthogonal means that any vector in Col(A) is orthogonal to any vector in Null(A).\n\nWait, but how exactly does that work? Let me think. If I take a vector y in Col(A), then y = A*v for some vector v. And if x is in Null(A), then A*x = 0. The inner product of y and x would be (A*v)^T * x. Which is v^T * A^T * x. But since A*x = 0, does that relate? Wait, A^T here is the transpose. Hmm, maybe I need to use the property that the row space is orthogonal to the nullspace. Wait, isn't that a standard result? \n\nWait, the fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that the row space is orthogonal to the nullspace. So Col(A) is the row space of A^T. So maybe there's confusion here. Wait, the original question says Col(A) is orthogonal to Null(A). But according to the standard theorem, Null(A) is orthogonal to the row space of A. Unless A is symmetric, Col(A) isn't necessarily the row space. So perhaps the user might be mistaken? Or maybe there's a specific condition?\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose A is an m×n matrix. Then Col(A) is a subspace of R^m, and Null(A) is a subspace of R^n. Wait, how can they be orthogonal if they are in different spaces? Unless we're considering A^T or something else. Oh, wait! Maybe the user is referring to the left null space and the column space. Because the left null space is the set of vectors y such that y^T A = 0, which is in R^m, the same space as Col(A). Then, the left null space is orthogonal to the column space. But the question says nullspace, which is usually the right null space (Null(A)) in R^n. \n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake. But the original question says \"the column space of a matrix A is orthogonal to its nullspace\". If the nullspace here refers to the right null space, then Col(A) and Null(A) are in different spaces (R^m vs R^n), so their vectors can't be orthogonal. Therefore, maybe the intended question was to show that the column space of A is orthogonal to the left null space of A. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo or misunderstanding. \n\nBut assuming the user meant to say that the row space is orthogonal to the nullspace, which is the standard result. But the user's question specifically mentions column space and nullspace. So perhaps there's an assumption missing here. For example, if the matrix A is symmetric, then Col(A) would be the same as the row space, so Null(A) would be orthogonal to Col(A). Alternatively, if A is square and some other condition. \n\nWait, the user's original problem doesn't mention any specific conditions on A. So perhaps the problem is incorrectly stated. But since the user is asking this question, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again. Suppose we have a vector x in Null(A), so A x = 0. Then, for any vector y in Col(A), y = A v for some v. The inner product of y and x is (A v) · x = (A v)^T x = v^T A^T x. But unless A is symmetric or something, this isn't necessarily zero. Wait, unless x is in Null(A^T), which would be the left null space. Then, A^T x = 0, which would make v^T A^T x = 0. But x in Null(A) implies A x = 0, not A^T x = 0. \n\nTherefore, unless there's a specific condition on A, like A being symmetric, then Col(A) and Null(A) aren't necessarily orthogonal. So maybe the original problem has a mistake, but the user is asking how to show that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is in the context of real matrices and using the standard inner product. Wait, even so, the dimensions don't match. For example, if A is m×n, Col(A) is in R^m and Null(A) is in R^n. So unless m = n, they can't be subspaces of the same space, hence orthogonality isn't defined. \n\nTherefore, the problem as stated might be incorrect. But maybe the user intended to refer to the row space and nullspace. Alternatively, maybe they meant the column space of A transpose? Let me check the standard theorem. The four fundamental subspaces: Col(A) and Null(A^T) are orthogonal complements in R^m, and Col(A^T) (row space) and Null(A) are orthogonal complements in R^n. So perhaps the user confused column space with row space. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct problem should be showing that the row space is orthogonal to the nullspace. But the user's question specifically says column space. Therefore, there's either a misunderstanding or a misstatement in the problem. \n\nHowever, assuming that the problem is as stated, perhaps the user made a mistake. But the answer would need to point that out. Alternatively, maybe there's an implicit assumption, such as A being square and symmetric. But the problem doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, in terms of structuring the problem according to the user's format, the Assumptions would need to clarify any conditions necessary. But the original problem doesn't state any, so maybe the assumptions are just that A is a real matrix, and the inner product is the standard one. But since Col(A) and Null(A) are in different spaces unless m = n, perhaps the assumption is that A is a square matrix. \n\nWait, let's check the original question again: \"How do you show that the column space of a matrix A is orthogonal to its nullspace?\" The user didn't provide any specific conditions. So perhaps the problem is ill-posed unless A is square. Let me assume A is an n×n matrix. Then Col(A) is in R^n and Null(A) is in R^n, so they are in the same space. But even then, they aren't necessarily orthogonal. For example, take A = [[1, 1], [0, 0]]. Then Col(A) is the span of [1, 0]^T, and Null(A) is the solutions to x + y = 0, so vectors like [1, -1]^T. The inner product of [1,0] and [1,-1] is 1, which is not zero. Hence, they aren't orthogonal. \n\nTherefore, unless there is an additional condition on A, such as A being symmetric (so that Col(A) is the row space, and Null(A) is orthogonal to row space), the statement isn't true. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the original problem has an implicit assumption that A is symmetric. So, in structuring the problem, the assumption should include that A is a symmetric matrix. Then, Col(A) is the same as the row space, and the nullspace is orthogonal to the row space. \n\nBut since the user's example didn't add assumptions unless necessary, maybe in this case, the problem as stated is incorrect. However, since the user is asking how to show it, perhaps there's a different approach. Wait, maybe using the definition of orthogonality through the dot product. Take any y in Col(A), which is y = A v for some v. Take x in Null(A), so A x = 0. Then y · x = (A v) · x = v · (A^T x). If A is not symmetric, this is v · (A^T x). But unless A^T x = 0, which would mean x is in the left nullspace of A. But Null(A) is the right nullspace. So, unless A^T x = 0, which isn't necessarily true. \n\nTherefore, unless A is symmetric, A^T x = A x = 0, so if x is in Null(A), then A^T x = 0 only if A is symmetric. Hence, the only way for y · x = 0 for all y in Col(A) and x in Null(A) is if A is symmetric. \n\nTherefore, the assumption missing here is that A is a symmetric matrix. So, to structure the problem correctly, the assumption should include that A is symmetric. \n\nBut the original problem doesn't state that. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. However, given the user's question, perhaps they are referring to the row space and nullspace being orthogonal, which is a standard result. Maybe they confused column space with row space. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is about the left nullspace and column space, then yes, they are orthogonal. The left nullspace is the set of vectors y such that y^T A = 0, which is orthogonal to Col(A). So, perhaps the user mixed up nullspace with left nullspace. \n\nIn that case, the correct problem would be showing that column space is orthogonal to the left nullspace. But the original question says \"its nullspace\", which typically refers to the right nullspace. \n\nGiven this confusion, to format the problem according to the user's instructions, I need to list assumptions. However, the original question as stated has an issue. But assuming the user intended to refer to the left nullspace, or perhaps the matrix is square and symmetric, we need to specify assumptions. \n\nBut since the original problem doesn't mention any, perhaps the correct approach is to state that the problem as posed is incorrect unless certain assumptions are added. However, according to the user's example, they might have filtered assumptions from the original problem. But in this case, the original problem doesn't have additional assumptions. \n\nWait, looking back at the example provided by the user: the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem added the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's restricted to n divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the example given by the user might not be accurate. Wait, no, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrects it by adding the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Because 91 is 7*13, so the statement might not hold for all n, but only when n is a multiple of 6 and 7? Hmm, not sure. \n\nAnyway, in the current problem, the user's question is as stated, without additional conditions. So to structure it, perhaps list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a real matrix,\nThe column space of A is considered as a subspace of R^m,\nThe nullspace of A is considered as a subspace of R^n,\nm = n (so A is square),\nA is symmetric.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state any of these. Hence, perhaps the correct answer is that the problem as stated is incorrect unless certain conditions are met, but according to the user's format, we need to present assumptions and the problem. Since the original question didn't specify, maybe the assumptions are left blank, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the orthogonal complement of the column space in R^n, which would be the left nullspace. But again, the wording is confusing. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem\", perhaps the original question is missing the assumption that A is a square matrix and symmetric. Therefore, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a real matrix,\nA is a square matrix,\nA is symmetric.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the column space of A is orthogonal to its nullspace.\n\nBut since the original question doesn't mention these, perhaps the assistant should infer that the problem as stated is incomplete and needs these assumptions. However, since the user wants to format the problem by filtering unrelated information and listing assumptions line by line, maybe in this case, the key assumption is that A is a symmetric matrix, allowing the column space (which equals the row space) to be orthogonal to the nullspace.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would include the assumptions that A is symmetric and square, even if the original question didn't state them explicitly, because otherwise the statement isn't true. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$A$ is a real matrix,\n$A$ is a square matrix,\n$A$ is symmetric.\nProblem: \nProve that the column space of matrix $A$ is orthogonal to its nullspace.",
