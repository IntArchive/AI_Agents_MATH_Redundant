    "AcceptedAnswer": "The geometric series $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1/2)^k = 1$ . Hence $x_n = 2^{\\sum_{k=1}^n (1/2)^k} \\le 2$. \nHence, The sequence is bounded above by $2$ and thus the series converges as it is increasing. Now you can use the hint given by ferson2020 to see that the limit $L$ has the property $L = \\sqrt{2L}$ and hence $L = 2$. Added: I am not sure if you proved the formula $$x_n = 2^{\\sum_{k=1}^n (1/2)^k}$$ so I give a proof here. We proceed with induction on n. The base case $n = 1$ holds by definition. Now assume it holds for $x_n$, we show that it is holds for $x_{n+1}$. We have $x_n = \\sqrt{2x_n}$. So by the inductive hypothesis: $$x_{n+1} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2^{\\sum_{k=1}^n (1/2)^k}} = 2^{({\\sum_{k=1}^n (1/2)^k} +1)/2}$$ Now , $ S = \\sum_{k=1}^n (1/2)^k = 1/2 + 1/4 + \\ldots 1/2^n$ and if we multiply this with $1/2$ we get $1/4 + 1/8 + \\ldots 1/2^{n+1}$. So $$S/2 = \\sum_{k=2}^{n+1}(1/2)^k$$ Then $$S/2 + 1/2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}(1/2)^k$$ So we have $x_{n+1} = 2^{(S +1)/2}= 2^{\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}(1/2)^k}$ this completes the proof.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first understand the original question thoroughly.\n\nThe problem is about showing that the sequence √2, √(2√2), √(2√(2√2)), ... converges and finding its limit. The user has already tried expressing the sequence as x_n = 2^{sum_{k=1}^n (1/2^k)} and wants to use the Monotonic Convergence Theorem. They mentioned they proved the sequence is increasing but are stuck on proving it's bounded above by 2, specifically using induction.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given in the original problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption should address one property or condition of one object.\n\nLooking at the problem here, the sequence is defined recursively. Each term is sqrt(2 * previous term). Let's see:\n\n- The sequence starts with √2.\n- Each subsequent term is sqrt(2 * previous term). So x_{n+1} = sqrt(2 * x_n).\n- The user has already represented this as x_n = 2^{sum_{k=1}^n (1/2^k)}, which simplifies to 2^{1 - 1/2^n} because the sum of a geometric series with ratio 1/2 is 1 - 1/2^n.\n\nBut for the assumptions, maybe the key properties here are:\n\n1. The sequence is defined recursively: x_1 = sqrt(2), and x_{n+1} = sqrt(2 x_n).\n2. The sequence is increasing (as the user has proven).\n3. The user wants to apply the Monotonic Convergence Theorem, which requires the sequence to be monotonic and bounded.\n\nHowever, the problem statement itself doesn't explicitly state all these. The original question's assumptions are more implicit. The user is asking to structure the problem by filtering out unrelated information and listing assumptions.\n\nSo, the problem is to show convergence and find the limit. The user mentioned they tried proving bounded above by 2. So the critical assumptions here are:\n\n- The sequence is defined recursively as x_{n+1} = sqrt(2 x_n) with x_1 = sqrt(2).\n- The sequence is increasing (already proven by the user).\n- The sequence is bounded above (which needs to be proven, but the problem statement itself may not include this as an assumption, rather as a condition to verify).\n\nWait, the problem as stated is to \"Show that the sequence ... converges and find its limit.\" So the assumptions would be the definition of the sequence. The original problem doesn't mention that it's increasing or bounded; that's part of what the user is trying to establish. Therefore, the key assumption is the recursive definition of the sequence. However, the user's own work shows that they expressed x_n in exponential terms. But for the structured problem, should we include the recursive definition or the closed-form expression?\n\nLooking at the example given, the original problem had an expression for A(n), and the formatted problem included the expression. So here, the problem statement should include the sequence's definition. However, the user provided both the recursive form (sqrt(2), sqrt(2√2), etc.) and the closed-form expression with the sum. But the problem is to show convergence and find the limit. The assumptions should be the properties given in the problem, not the ones the user derived.\n\nWait, the example given in the original instruction was that the formatted problem included the assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was stated \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. Wait, that seems like the user made a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem changed it to n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a misunderstanding in the example. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem: assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That might be an error. Perhaps the example was not correctly structured. However, the user provided that example, so maybe there's a specific way they want the assumptions extracted.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example. So following that, perhaps the assumptions should include the definition of the sequence and any given conditions. The problem is to show convergence and find the limit, so the assumptions would be the recursive definition of the sequence.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an assumption (n is integer) which was part of the problem statement, and then an additional assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was to filter out unrelated information. For instance, if the original problem had some conditions, but the formatted problem lists them as assumptions. Wait, maybe in the example, the user incorrectly added an assumption. Let me see:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n must be divisible by 7, which restricts it. That seems incorrect. Perhaps the example was a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the instruction given by the user: \"filter the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\".\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to show the sequence converges and find its limit. The user has expressed the sequence in a closed-form, but the problem as stated is about the recursive sequence. So the key assumption is the definition of the sequence. The closed-form expression provided by the user might be their own work, so perhaps it's not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\n- The sequence is defined as x_1 = √2.\n- Each subsequent term is x_{n+1} = √(2 x_n).\n\nBut wait, the problem statement gives the sequence as √2, √(2√2), etc., which is the recursive definition. So those are the given conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should list:\n\n1. The sequence is defined recursively by x_1 = √2.\n2. For each n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} = √(2 x_n).\n\nAdditionally, the problem is to show convergence and find the limit. However, in the example, the assumptions included properties of n, but here, the sequence's definition is part of the problem's assumptions. The problem doesn't mention anything about n being an integer or other properties beyond the sequence's definition.\n\nWait, the problem statement is about the sequence, which is indexed by n, so n is a positive integer. But maybe that's implicit. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, we should include that n is a positive integer as an assumption, even though it's implicit in sequence definitions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sequence is defined by x_1 = √2.\n- For each positive integer n, x_{n+1} = √(2 x_n).\n- The sequence is increasing. (But wait, the problem doesn't state that; the user proved it. The problem itself doesn't include that as a given. So we shouldn't list it as an assumption. The problem is to show convergence, which requires proving monotonicity and boundedness. Therefore, the assumptions are only the definition of the sequence.)\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Show that the sequence ... converges and find its limit.\" The problem doesn't provide any assumptions beyond the definition of the sequence. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. The sequence is defined by x_1 = √2.\n2. For each n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} = √(2 x_n).\n\nBut the user's attempt mentions that they expressed the sequence as x_n = 2^{sum_{k=1}^n (1/2^k)}, but that's their own work, not part of the problem statement. Therefore, in structuring the problem, we should only include the information given in the original question, filtering out the user's attempts and any unrelated info.\n\nSo the original problem is: Show that the sequence √2, √(2√2), ... converges and find its limit. The problem statement doesn't mention the closed-form expression; that's the user's approach. Therefore, the assumptions are the recursive definition.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the formatted problem included the expression for A(n), which was part of the original problem. Similarly, here, the problem statement includes the sequence written out as terms, so perhaps the assumption is the sequence's recursive definition.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe sequence is defined by x_1 = √2,\nFor each positive integer n, x_{n+1} = √(2 x_n).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence converges and find its limit.\n\nBut wait, the example had each assumption on a separate line. Each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the two parts of the definition are separate: initial term and recursive relation.\n\nYes, so:\n\nAssumption:\nx_1 = √2,\nFor each positive integer n, x_{n+1} = √(2 x_n).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence converges and find its limit.\n\nBut the user's original question also mentioned that they expressed x_n as 2^{sum...}, but that's their own work. The problem as posed on Math Stack Exchange doesn't include that expression. Therefore, we shouldn't include that in the assumptions. The problem is purely about the recursively defined sequence.\n\nThus, the correct structured problem is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nx₁ = √2,\nFor each positive integer n, x_{n+1} = √(2 xₙ).\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence converges and find its limit.\n###",
