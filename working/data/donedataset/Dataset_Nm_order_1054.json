    "Content": "Let $T$ be an endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$. Let $$f(x)=x^n+c_1x^{n-1}+ \\dots + c_n$$ be the characteristic polynomial of $T$. It is well known that $c_m=(-1)^m\\text{tr}(\\bigwedge^mT)$. If the base field is $\\mathbf{C}$, then we can prove it using a density argument. The statement is true for diagonalizable matrices, which are dense in $M_n(\\mathbf{C})$. This actually enough to prove it general, but I don't find it very illuminating. I would like to see an abstract proof of this result. Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\newcommand{\\tr}{\\operatorname{tr}}$ First, let us give an alternative description of $\\tr {\\bigwedge}^m T$. Let $e_1,e_2,\\dots,e_n$ be a fixed basis for $V$, and for $J \\subset \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$ with $|J| = m$, let $T_J$ denote the $m \\times m$ matrix acquired by keeping the entries $T_{i,j}$ with $i,j \\in J$. Alternatively, if $P_J$ is the projection onto $\\operatorname{span} \\{e_i\\}_{i \\in J}$ then $T_J = P_J T P_J$. My claim is that:\n$$\\tr {\\bigwedge}^m T = \\sum_J \\det T_J$$ where the sum runs over all $J$ with $|J| = m$. More precisely, if $e_J := \\bigwedge_{i \\in J} e_i$ (in any order, but fixed once and for all), then ${\\bigwedge}^m T e_J = \\det T_J e_J + \\sum_{I \\neq J} \\alpha_I e_I$. This can be showed by brute-force application of the definition on exterior power and the determinant (the one with sum over permutations). Another possibility is to say that:\n$$ \n{\\bigwedge}^m P_J {\\bigwedge}^m T e_J\n = {\\bigwedge}^m P_J {\\bigwedge}^m T {\\bigwedge}^m P_J e_J \n =  {\\bigwedge}^m T_J e_J = \\det T_J e_J\n$$\nwhere the last equality holds because $m$ is the dimension of the space on which $T_J$ acts ( Wiki lists this property as one of the possible definitions of $\\det$). Now, because $\\tr {\\bigwedge}^m T$ is by definition the sum of coeffs at $e_J$ in ${\\bigwedge}^m T e_J$ (note that $e_J$ form the basis), it turns out that the formula with the sum works. Thus, it remains to see that $c_m = (-1)^m \\sum_J \\det T_J$. This can be done by looking at how the characteristic polynomial is computed from the definition, using the matrix form of $T$.  I think this is known, and has been asked on MSE (except the sign differs). The gist of the proof I know is that to get $(-x)^{n-m}$ from $\\det(T - xI)$, you need to choose the term $-x$ in $n-m$ places, and from what remains you get the coefficient $\\det T_J$, where $J$ is the set of indices where you did not take the $-x$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of an endomorphism T on a finite-dimensional vector space V are given by the traces of the exterior powers of T. Specifically, they mention that each coefficient c_m is equal to (-1)^m times the trace of the m-th exterior power of T, denoted as ⋀^m T. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the characteristic polynomial is. For a linear operator T on V, the characteristic polynomial f(x) is defined as det(xI - T), where I is the identity matrix. The coefficients of this polynomial are related to the eigenvalues of T. For example, the leading coefficient is 1, the next coefficient is the negative of the trace of T, then the next is related to the sum of the principal minors of order 2, and so on, up to the constant term which is (-1)^n times the determinant of T.\n\nNow, the problem states that each coefficient c_m can be expressed as (-1)^m times the trace of the exterior power ⋀^m T. The user mentions that over the complex field, one can use a density argument by considering diagonalizable matrices, which are dense in M_n(C). But they want a more abstract, perhaps algebraic, proof that doesn't rely on density or specific properties of complex matrices.\n\nLet me think about exterior powers. The exterior power ⋀^m V is a vector space consisting of alternating tensors of order m. The induced endomorphism ⋀^m T acts on ⋀^m V by mapping v1 ∧ ... ∧ vm to T(v1) ∧ ... ∧ T(vm). The trace of this endomorphism would then be the sum of its eigenvalues. For a diagonalizable T with eigenvalues λ1, ..., λn, the trace of ⋀^m T would be the sum of all possible products of m distinct eigenvalues, which is exactly the elementary symmetric sum σ_m(λ1, ..., λn). \n\nIn the characteristic polynomial, the coefficient c_m is (-1)^m times σ_{n - m}(λ1, ..., λn) if we follow the standard convention where the characteristic polynomial is written as x^n - tr(T) x^{n-1} + ... + (-1)^n det(T). Wait, maybe I need to check the indexing here. Let's clarify:\n\nIf the characteristic polynomial is written as f(x) = x^n + c_1 x^{n-1} + ... + c_n, then according to Vieta's formula, c_k = (-1)^k σ_k(λ1, ..., λn), where σ_k is the elementary symmetric sum of degree k. But here, the problem states that c_m = (-1)^m tr(⋀^m T). So, for diagonalizable T, tr(⋀^m T) is σ_m(λ1, ..., λn). Therefore, c_m = (-1)^m σ_m(λ1, ..., λn), which matches the Vieta's formula only if the characteristic polynomial is written with the coefficients c_m in such a way. Wait, there might be an indexing issue here.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the standard characteristic polynomial. Usually, det(xI - T) = x^n - tr(T) x^{n-1} + ... + (-1)^n det(T). So in this case, the coefficient of x^{n-m} is (-1)^m σ_m(λ1, ..., λn), where σ_m is the sum of all m-degree elementary symmetric polynomials. So, if f(x) = x^n + c_1 x^{n-1} + ... + c_n, then c_m = (-1)^m σ_m. However, the trace of ⋀^m T is exactly σ_m, since for diagonalizable T, the eigenvalues of ⋀^m T are all products λ_{i1} ... λ_{im} for i1 < ... < im, so the trace is σ_m. Therefore, c_m = (-1)^m tr(⋀^m T). That makes sense.\n\nBut the user wants to prove this without relying on the density of diagonalizable matrices over C. How can we approach this more abstractly? Maybe by using properties of exterior algebras and traces.\n\nLet me recall that for any endomorphism T, the trace of ⋀^m T can be related to the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. But how? Maybe via the exterior algebra's relation to the determinant and the characteristic polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, think about the generating function for the traces of exterior powers. The generating function for the traces of ⋀^m T is the sum_{m=0}^n (tr(⋀^m T)) t^m. On the other hand, the characteristic polynomial can be written as det(I + t T) = sum_{m=0}^n tr(⋀^m T) t^m. Wait, but this might be in the case when we're considering det(I + t T). Let me check.\n\nWait, the identity det(I + t T) = sum_{m=0}^n tr(⋀^m T) t^m is a standard identity in linear algebra. But the characteristic polynomial is det(t I - T) = t^n det(I - (T/t)). Let me see. If we set t = 1/x, then det(xI - T) = x^n det(I - T/x) = x^n sum_{m=0}^n tr(⋀^m (-T/x)) = x^n sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m tr(⋀^m T) x^{-m} ) = sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m tr(⋀^m T) x^{n - m}.\n\nComparing this to the characteristic polynomial det(xI - T) = x^n - tr(T) x^{n-1} + ... + (-1)^n det(T), we see that the coefficient c_m of x^{n - m} is (-1)^m tr(⋀^m T). Therefore, indeed, c_m = (-1)^m tr(⋀^m T). \n\nTherefore, this identity follows from expanding det(xI - T) using the generating function of the exterior powers. The key identity here is det(I + t T) = sum_{m=0}^n tr(⋀^m T) t^m. So replacing t with -T/x and multiplying by x^n gives the characteristic polynomial.\n\nTherefore, to prove the result abstractly, we can use this generating function approach, which relies on properties of exterior powers and determinants. This would be a more algebraic proof, not requiring a density argument over C.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the fact that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are the elementary symmetric sums of the eigenvalues, and the trace of the exterior power is the sum of the products of eigenvalues taken m at a time, which is exactly the elementary symmetric sum. Hence, c_m = (-1)^m times that sum. But this again relies on eigenvalues, which might require working over an algebraically closed field. However, the original problem states that the base field is arbitrary, or maybe the user is okay with assuming characteristic 0 or something? Wait, the original question mentions that the base field is C for the density argument, but they want an abstract proof. So perhaps the abstract proof works over any field, or at least a field where trace is defined, and exterior powers make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the relation between the exterior algebra and the characteristic polynomial. Let me recall that the exterior algebra is a graded algebra, and the action of T on the exterior algebra induces an endomorphism on each exterior power. The generating function of the traces of these endomorphisms gives the determinant, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nSo, to formalize the proof:\n\nConsider the generating function F(t) = sum_{m=0}^n tr(⋀^m T) t^m. Then, it's known that F(t) = det(I + t T). Now, consider the characteristic polynomial det(xI - T). Let's perform a substitution: set t = -1/x. Then, det(xI - T) = x^n det(I - T/x) = x^n F(-1/x) = x^n sum_{m=0}^n tr(⋀^m T) (-1/x)^m = sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m tr(⋀^m T) x^{n - m}.\n\nComparing this to the expansion of det(xI - T) = x^n + c_1 x^{n-1} + ... + c_n, we see that the coefficient c_m of x^{n - m} is indeed (-1)^m tr(⋀^m T). Therefore, this identity holds for any endomorphism T over any field where the determinant and trace are defined, which is a general, abstract proof.\n\nHence, the key step is using the identity relating the generating function of the traces of exterior powers to the determinant. This avoids the density argument and works abstractly.",
