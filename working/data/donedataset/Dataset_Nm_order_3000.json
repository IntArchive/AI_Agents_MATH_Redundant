    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let\n$$N=(2+\\sqrt{5})^p+(2-\\sqrt{5})^p.$$\nNote that $N$ is an integer. There are various ways to see this. One can for example expand using the binomial theorem, and observe that the terms involving odd powers of $\\sqrt{5}$ cancel. Because $(2-\\sqrt{5})^p$ is a negative number close to $0$, it follows that\n$N=\\left\\lfloor (2+\\sqrt{5})^p\\right\\rfloor$. In the two binomial expansions, all the binomial coefficients $\\binom{p}{k}$ apart from the first and last are divisible by $p$. The first term in each expansion is $2^p$. We conclude that $N\\equiv 2\\cdot 2^p\\pmod{p}$, and the result follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure the given problem according to the specified format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the Assumption and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"odd prime division,\" and the question is to prove that if p is an odd prime, then p divides the floor of (2 + sqrt(5))^p minus 2^{p+1}. The user also mentioned they're struggling and provided some working out, but the key is to extract the problem's assumptions and restate it.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the Assumptions section lists each condition line by line, applied to one object. In the example, they listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But wait, in the original problem, the example had \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe the example was modifying the problem? Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example was from a different problem. Wait, no, perhaps the user made a mistake there. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nThe current problem states: Prove that if p is an odd prime, then p divides floor((2 + sqrt(5))^p) - 2^{p+1}.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. p is an odd prime.\n\nThat's the only assumption given in the problem statement. The problem is to show that p divides that expression. So in the Assumption section, we list each condition. Since \"p is an odd prime\" is a single condition applied to p, even though \"odd\" and \"prime\" are two properties, but they are both about p. So maybe it's better to split into two lines? Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption. That seems like maybe the example was incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to show how to structure. Anyway, for the current problem, the original assumption is that p is an odd prime. So \"p is an odd prime\" is a single condition. But according to the instruction, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe split into two: p is a prime, and p is odd. But wait, in mathematics, an odd prime is a prime that's not 2, which is the only even prime. So perhaps the original problem says \"if p is an odd prime,\" which combines both properties. However, the instruction says each assumption should be one property or condition. Therefore, maybe split into:\n\n- p is a prime.\n\n- p is odd.\n\nBut is that necessary? The original problem says \"if p is an odd prime,\" so maybe in the assumption section, it's better to list them as separate points. Let me check the example again. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So each line is a separate condition. Therefore, for the current problem, since \"odd prime\" is two conditions (prime and odd), we should list them separately. However, the term \"odd prime\" in mathematics is a single condition, but technically, it's two properties. So maybe the correct way is to split them. Let me think: if the problem had said \"if p is a prime greater than 3,\" then we would list \"p is a prime\" and \"p > 3\" as separate assumptions. Similarly, here, \"odd prime\" implies p is prime and p is odd. Since 2 is the only even prime, so \"odd prime\" is equivalent to \"prime\" and \"p ≠ 2\". But maybe in the problem, they just state \"p is an odd prime,\" so perhaps the correct way is to list two assumptions: p is a prime, and p is odd. However, in the original problem statement, it's given as a single condition. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property. Therefore, splitting into two.\n\nSo Assumptions:\n\n- p is a prime.\n\n- p is odd.\n\nBut wait, p being odd is already implied if it's an odd prime, but since the problem states it as a single condition, perhaps the user wants to split it. Alternatively, maybe \"p is an odd prime\" is a single assumption. The example given in the user's instruction had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So perhaps \"p is an odd prime\" can be considered as one assumption. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like the example might have been a modification. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem's assumption includes n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't have that. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but regardless, the instruction is to split each assumption into single properties.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, \"if p is an odd prime,\" we split into:\n\n- p is a prime.\n\n- p is odd.\n\nBut technically, \"odd prime\" is a single condition. However, primes can be 2 (even) or odd. So if we split, but I need to follow the user's instruction. The example shows splitting conditions. For example, the original problem was \"for every integer n,\" and the formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So in that case, the original problem's \"for every integer n\" became \"n is an integer,\" and an additional assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added. Wait, that seems contradictory. The original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption. So maybe the example was incorrect. However, the user provided that example, so perhaps they intended that the formatted problem includes the assumptions from the problem. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" which is not an assumption but a universal statement. However, the formatted problem in the example lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So maybe the user is treating the universal quantifier as an assumption. Therefore, in the current problem, \"if p is an odd prime\" is the assumption, which can be split into two separate assumptions: p is prime, and p is odd.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section would be:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime,\np is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that p divides \\(\\lfloor(2+\\sqrt{5})^p\\rfloor -2^{p+1}\\).\n\nBut I need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem doesn't mention anything else, so those are the two assumptions. Therefore, that's how the formatted problem should look.",
