    "Content": "I learned that every compact set is closed and bounded; and also that an open set is usually not compact. How to show that a concrete open set, for example the interval $(0,1)$, is not compact? I tried to show that $(0,1)$ has no finite sub cover.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think the following may be a source of confusion: the statement \"$(0,1)$ has no finite sub cover\" doesn't make any sense.  You first have to choose a cover of $(0,1)$ by open sets.  Then this may or may not have a finite sub-cover. If $(0,1)$ were compact, any such cover would (by the definition of compact in terms of open covers) have to have a finite subcover.  In fact, $(0,1)$ is not compact, and so what this means is that we can find some cover of $(0,1)$ by open sets which does not have a finite subcover. Omnomnomnom gives an example of such a cover in their answer, and there are lots of others; here's one: the cover $\\{U_2, \\ldots, U_n , \\ldots\\}$ where $U_n = (1/n, 1-1/n).$ Here is a cover which is finite, and hence does have a finite subcover (namely, itself): $\\{(0,1)\\}$. Here is another: $\\{(0,1/2), (1/3,1)\\}$. Here is an infinite cover which admits a finite subcover $\\{(0,1), (0,1/2), \n\\ldots, (0,1/n) , \\ldots \\}$. Hopefully these examples help to clarify what the definition of compactness in terms of finite subcovers is about.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know why the open interval (0,1) isn't a compact set. They mentioned that compact sets are closed and bounded, and open sets usually aren't compact. They tried showing no finite subcover exists.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of compactness. In topology, a set is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. So, to prove (0,1) isn't compact, I should find an open cover of (0,1) that doesn't have a finite subcover.\n\nThe example given by the user is about (0,1). Let's think about how to construct such an open cover. Maybe using intervals that approach the endpoints. For example, using intervals like (1/n, 1) for n starting from 2 upwards. As n increases, these intervals get closer to covering the entire (0,1). But if we take any finite number of these, the smallest n would leave out the interval (0,1/m) where m is the smallest n used. So, the finite subcover wouldn't cover the entire (0,1), hence no finite subcover exists.\n\nWait, but the problem here is to structure the problem according to the given format. The original question is about showing (0,1) isn't compact by demonstrating no finite subcover. The user might have tried that approach but needs the problem structured properly.\n\nLooking at the example provided in the format, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. For the problem here, the key assumptions would be about the interval being open, and perhaps the space it's in (like the standard topology on the real line). But the problem as stated is general: show (0,1) is not compact. The original question mentions trying to show it has no finite subcover, which relates directly to the definition of compactness.\n\nSo, structuring this, the assumptions would include that we're working in the real numbers with the standard topology, the interval (0,1) is considered as a subset of the real numbers, and maybe that compactness is defined via open covers having finite subcovers. But the user's question doesn't state these explicitly; they are part of the context. However, in the example given, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". For the current problem, the key assumptions would be:\n\n- The interval (0,1) is considered as a subset of the real numbers.\n- The real numbers are equipped with the standard topology (where open sets are unions of open intervals).\n- Compactness is defined as every open cover having a finite subcover.\n\nBut maybe the user's problem is more straightforward. The problem is to show that (0,1) is not compact. The assumptions needed are the definitions. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were specific to the problem. Here, perhaps the main assumption is that we're working in the standard topology on ℝ, and (0,1) is an open interval. But the user's problem doesn't mention any additional conditions, so maybe the assumptions are minimal.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about showing (0,1) isn't compact, the key assumptions are the properties of compactness in the context of the real numbers. The user is likely working within the standard real line, where Heine-Borel theorem applies (closed and bounded implies compact). But since (0,1) is open, it's not closed, hence by Heine-Borel, not compact. However, the user wants to show it directly via the definition, not using Heine-Borel.\n\nSo, structuring the problem as per the format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The interval (0,1) is considered as a subset of the real numbers with the standard topology.\n- Compactness is defined by the open cover finite subcover property.\n\nProblem: Prove that the open interval (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions listed were specific to the problem's variables. Here, the problem is more about topology. The original question on Math SE was asking to show (0,1) is not compact by the definition, so the key assumption is that compactness is defined via open covers. Therefore, maybe the assumption is just that (0,1) is an open interval in the real numbers. The problem is to prove it's not compact.\n\nBut the example's assumptions included specific conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem is more general. Let me check the example again. The user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to show (0,1) is not compact. The assumptions would be the necessary conditions. Since compactness in topology requires the set to be in a topological space, here it's real numbers with standard topology. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The interval (0,1) is an open interval in the real numbers.\n- The real numbers are equipped with the standard Euclidean topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that the interval (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are just the definitions. But in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's variables, so perhaps here the assumption is simply that (0,1) is an open interval. But since the question is about compactness, which depends on the topology, perhaps we need to specify the space.\n\nBut maybe the user expects a simpler structure. The original question says: \"show that a concrete open set, for example the interval (0,1), is not compact.\" So the key points are:\n\n- The set in question is (0,1), which is open.\n- The problem is to show it's not compact.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- (0,1) is an open interval.\n- Compactness is defined via the existence of finite subcovers for every open cover.\n\nBut the user's example didn't include definitions but specific conditions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: \n- (0,1) is considered as a subset of the real numbers with the standard topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that the interval (0,1) is not compact.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem mentions trying to show it has no finite subcover, maybe the assumption is that compactness is defined via open covers having finite subcovers. But that's part of the definition, so maybe not an assumption but part of the problem's context.\n\nIn the example given, the assumptions were specific to the variable n (it's an integer, divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions would be about the set (0,1). So the key assumptions are:\n\n- (0,1) is an open interval in ℝ.\n- The topology on ℝ is the standard Euclidean topology.\n\nBut perhaps the user doesn't need to specify the topology, assuming it's standard. So maybe the assumption is just that (0,1) is an open interval.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were two separate points. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set under consideration is the open interval (0,1).\n- The space is the real numbers with the standard topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nBut maybe even simpler. Since the problem is to prove (0,1) isn't compact, and the key point is that it's open but not closed in ℝ, but the user wants to use the definition directly. So the main assumption is that we're working in ℝ with standard topology, and (0,1) is the interval.\n\nAlternatively, considering the example, which listed assumptions about n, here the assumption is that (0,1) is an open interval. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- (0,1) is an open interval in the real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nThat seems concise. The user's original question is about showing a concrete open set (like (0,1)) isn't compact. The example given in the format had two assumptions, here maybe only one: the interval is open. But the fact that it's in the real numbers is also an assumption. So two assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set is the open interval (0,1).\n- The set is considered as a subset of the real numbers with the standard topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nBut the standard topology is usually assumed unless stated otherwise. So maybe just:\n\nAssumption:\n- The interval (0,1) is considered as a subset of the real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be structured with assumptions about the properties needed for compactness. However, since the example focused on the problem's variables, here the main assumption is the interval itself. So I think the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- (0,1) is an open interval in the real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nBut to align with the example, where the assumptions were about the variable's properties, here the assumptions are about the set's properties. So the interval being open and part of the real numbers. However, in the example, the assumptions included the variable being an integer and divisible by 7. For the current problem, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The interval (0,1) is a subset of the real numbers.\n- The interval (0,1) is open.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nBut since openness is part of the interval's definition, maybe it's redundant. Alternatively, the user's problem is to show that an open interval is not compact, so the key assumption is that the set is open. But (0,1) is open in ℝ. So, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The interval (0,1) is an open set in the standard topology of the real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nThis seems appropriate. Each assumption is a single property: being an open set, in the standard topology. But maybe split into two:\n\nAssumption:\n- The interval (0,1) is considered as a subset of the real numbers.\n- The real numbers are equipped with the standard Euclidean topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating. The key is to list the necessary assumptions for the problem. Since compactness depends on the topology, specifying the space and topology is important. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable, not the space. But here, the problem is about the space's properties.\n\nGiven that, I'll structure it as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The interval (0,1) is considered as a subset of the real numbers with the standard topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants to focus on the open cover aspect:\n\nAssumption:\n- The interval (0,1) is equipped with the subspace topology from the real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that (0,1) is not a compact set.\n\nBut I think the first version is clearer. So the final answer should list the interval as a subset of the real numbers with standard topology, and the problem is to prove it's not compact.",
