    "Content": "This question concerns the generalized Representer Theorem , due to Schölkopf, Herbrich, and Smola . In this magnificent work, the authors provide two versions of the Representer Theorem, a non-parametric , and a semi-parametric one. Though, they provide a proof only for the non-parametric version, while they say that the proof for the semi-parametric version is slightly more technical, but straightforward. I fully understand the proof for the non-parametric version, but unfortunately I cannot find a way in order to start the proof of the semi-parametric. Below, I give the statements of the above two versions of the Representer Theorem, as well as the proof for the non-parametric case, and I would like to discuss about the proof of the semi-parametric version. # Theorem 1 (Non-parametric Representer Theorem) Suppose we are given a nonempty set $\\mathcal{X}$ , a positive definite real-valued kernel $k$ on $\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}$ , samples $(\\mathbf{x}_1,y_1),\\cdots,(\\mathbf{x}_m,y_m)\\in\\mathcal{x}\\times\\mathbb{R}$ , a strictly monotonically increasing real-valued function $g$ on $[0,\\infty)$ , an arbitrary cost function $c\\colon(\\mathcal{x}\\times\\mathbb{R}^2)^m\\to\\mathbb{R}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ , and a class of functions $$\n\\mathcal{F}=\\bigg\\{\nf\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{X}} \\mid f(\\cdot)=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\beta_i k(\\cdot, \\mathbf{z}_i), \\beta_i\\in\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbf{z}_i\\in\\mathcal{X}, \\lVert f \\rVert < \\infty\n\\bigg\\}.\n$$ Here, $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert$ denotes the norm in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) $\\mathcal{H}$ associated with $k$ . Then any $f\\in\\mathcal{F}$ minimizing the regularized risk functional $$\nc\n\\Big( \n(\\mathbf{x}_1,y_1,f(\\mathbf{x}_1)), \\cdots, (\\mathbf{x}_m,y_m,f(\\mathbf{x}_m))\n\\Big)\n+\ng\\big(\\lVert f \\rVert\\big)\n$$ admits a representation of the form $$\nf(\\cdot) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\alpha_i k(\\cdot,\\mathbf{x}_i).\n$$ Proof : Let $\\phi: \\mathcal{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{X}}$ , $$\n\\mathbf{x}\\mapsto k(\\cdot,\\mathbf{x}).\n$$ Since $k$ is a reproducing kernel, evaluation of the function $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$ on the point $\\mathbf{x}'$ yields $$\n(\\phi(\\mathbf{x}))(\\mathbf{x}')=k(\\mathbf{x}',\\mathbf{x})=\\langle \\phi(\\mathbf{x}'), \\phi(\\mathbf{x}) \\rangle,\n$$ for all $\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}'\\in\\mathcal{X}$ . Here $\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the dot product in $\\mathcal{H}$ . Given $\\mathbf{x}_1,\\cdots,\\mathbf{x}_m$ , any $f\\in\\mathcal{F}$ can be decomposed into a part that lives in the span of the $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ , and a part which is orthogonal to it, i.e. $$\nf = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\alpha_i\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i) + u,\n$$ for some $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ and $u\\in\\mathcal{F}$ satisfying fot all $j$ , $$\n\\langle u,\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_j) \\rangle = 0.\n$$ Using the latter and the reproducing property mentioned above, application of $f$ to an arbitrary point $\\mathbf{x}_j$ yields $$\nf(\\mathbf{x}_j) = \n\\Big\\langle\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\alpha_i\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i) + u,\n\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_j)\n\\Big\\rangle\n=\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\alpha_i \n\\Big\\langle \n\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i),\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_j)\n\\Big\\rangle,\n$$ which is independent of $u$ . Consequently, the first term of the regularized risk functional is independent of $u$ . As for the second term, since $u$ is orthogonal to $\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\alpha_i\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ , and $g$ is strictly monotonic, we get $$\ng\\big(\\lVert f \\rVert\\big)\n= \ng\\bigg(\\bigg\\lVert \n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\alpha_i\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i) + u\n\\bigg\\rVert\\bigg)\n=\ng\\bigg(\n\\sqrt{\n\\bigg\\lVert \n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\alpha_i\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i)\n\\bigg\\rVert^2\n+\n\\bigg\\lVert \nu\n\\bigg\\rVert^2\n}\n\\bigg)\n\\geq\ng\\bigg(\n\\bigg\\lVert \n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\alpha_i\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i)\n\\bigg\\rVert\n\\bigg),\n$$ with equality iff $u=0$ . Setting $u=0$ thus, does not affect the first term of the regularized risk functional, while strictly reducing the second term - hence, any minimizer must have $u=0$ . Consequently, any solution takes the form $f=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\alpha_i\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ , i.e., using the reproducing property, $$\nf(\\cdot) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\alpha_i k(\\cdot,\\mathbf{x}_i).\n$$ Q.E.D. Now, the statement of the semi-parametric version extends the non-parametric as follows: # Theorem 2 (Semi-parametric Representer Theorem) Suppose that, in addition to the assumptions of the previous theorem, we are given a set of $M$ real-valued functions $\\{\\psi_p\\}_{p=1}^{M}$ defined on $\\mathcal{X}$ , with the property that the $m\\times M$ matrix $\\big( \\psi_p(\\mathbf{x}_i) \\big)_{ip}$ has rank $M$ . Then, any $\\tilde{f}:=f+h$ , with $f\\in\\mathcal{F}$ and $h\\in\\operatorname{span}\\{\\psi_p\\}$ , minimizing the regularized risk functional $$\nc\n\\Big( \n(\\mathbf{x}_1,y_1,\\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{x}_1)), \\cdots, (\\mathbf{x}_m,y_m,\\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{x}_m))\n\\Big)\n+\ng\\big(\\lVert f \\rVert\\big),\n$$ admits a representation of the form $$\n\\tilde{f}(\\cdot)\n=\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\alpha_i k(\\cdot,\\mathbf{x}_i)\n+\n\\sum_{p=1}^{M}\\beta_p \\psi_p(\\cdot),\n$$ with unique coefficients $\\beta_p\\in\\mathbb{R}$ , for all $p=1,\\cdots,M$ . It would be nice if you could provide a meaningful sketch of the proof. I think it may help some other people as well, who study this theory, but unfortunately do not have the appropriate background to prove such theorems by themselves (yet!). Thanks a lot!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that we have $\\tilde f = f + h$ as described. Let $V = span( k(\\cdot, x_i) )_{i=1,...,m}$. We can write any function $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ as $f = f_s + f_p$ where $f_s \\in V$ and $f_p \\in V^{\\perp}$. This means that $$\\tilde f(x_i) = f(x_i) + h(x_i) = f_s(x_i) + f_p(x_i) + h(x_i)$$ but since $f_p \\in V^{\\perp}$ we have that $f_p(x_i) =0$. Which yields: $$\\tilde f(x_i) = f(x_i) + h(x_i) = f_s(x_i) + h(x_i)$$ Thus $$c( (x_i, y_i, \\tilde f(x_i))_{i=1,...,m}) = c( (x_i, y_i, f_s(x_i) + h(x_i))_{i=1,...,m})$$ which means that $f_p$ has no effect on $c(\\cdot)$. Moreover, since $$\\|f\\|^2 = \\|f_s\\|^2 + \\|f_p\\|^2$$ by the pythagorean theorem, we have $$\\|f_s\\| \\le \\|f\\|$$ for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$. Thus $g(\\|f_s\\|) \\le g(\\|f\\|)$ since $g$ is strictly increasing. Thus we see if a function $\\tilde f = f+h$ minimizes the cost function $f_p$ must be zero. Thus $\\tilde f = f_s + h$ and since $f_s \\in V$ we have that $$\\tilde f = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_i k(\\cdot, x_i) + h$$ Finally when we evaluate $\\tilde f(x_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_i k(x_j, x_i) + h(x_j)$ we get $m$ equations for $$h(x_j) = \\sum_{p=1}^M \\beta_p \\psi_p(x_j) = \\tilde f(x_j) - \\sum_{i=1}^m a_i k(x_j, x_i).$$ By the assumptions on $\\psi_p(x_j)$ we see that $(\\psi_p(x_1),...,\\psi_p(x_m))^T$ (for $p=1,2,...,M$) are linearly independent vectors, and thus the coefficients $\\beta_p$ are uniquely determined.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, I need to help structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question about proving the semi-parametric Representer Theorem. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking.\n\nThe original question is about extending the proof from the non-parametric Representer Theorem to the semi-parametric version. The user has provided the details of both theorems and the proof for the non-parametric case. They want the assumptions and problem structured in a specific format, similar to the example given.\n\nFirst, I should extract the assumptions for the semi-parametric theorem. Let's look at Theorem 2. It mentions that in addition to the assumptions of Theorem 1, there are additional conditions. \n\nThe assumptions from Theorem 1 include:\n- A nonempty set 𝒳.\n- A positive definite real-valued kernel k on 𝒳×𝒳.\n- Samples (x₁,y₁),...,(xₘ,yₘ) in 𝒳×ℝ.\n- A strictly monotonically increasing function g on [0, ∞).\n- An arbitrary cost function c.\n- The function class ℱ defined as elements of the RKHS with finite norm.\n\nThen, for the semi-parametric version (Theorem 2), the additional assumptions are:\n- A set of M real-valued functions {ψₚ}ₚ=1^M defined on 𝒳.\n- The m×M matrix (ψₚ(xᵢ)) has rank M.\n\nThe problem is to prove that any minimizer ȳ = f + h (with f ∈ ℱ and h in the span of ψₚ) can be represented as a combination of the kernel functions evaluated at the data points and the parametric part with unique coefficients.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. For example, each of the assumptions from Theorem 1 should be listed, but since the problem is about the semi-parametric version, we need to include both the original assumptions and the new ones. However, the user's example only listed the assumptions relevant to the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no, the original problem's answer required divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13. But the example formatted problem lists assumptions as n is integer and n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn this case, for Theorem 2, the problem is to prove the representation of ȳ, given the original conditions of Theorem 1 plus the additional ones for the semi-parametric case. So, the assumptions should include all the necessary conditions from Theorem 1 and the new ones in Theorem 2.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as an example of the format. So perhaps the user wants the assumptions to be all the conditions needed for the theorem, even if some are not explicitly stated in the problem. Wait, in the example, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumptions are n is integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the original problem had an error. Alternatively, maybe the example is illustrative of how to structure, even if the content isn't perfect. So following that example, perhaps I should list all assumptions of Theorem 2, each as separate lines.\n\nLooking at the semi-parametric theorem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The set 𝒳 is nonempty.\n2. The kernel k is a positive definite real-valued kernel on 𝒳×𝒳.\n3. There are samples (x₁,y₁),...,(xₘ,yₘ) ∈ 𝒳×ℝ.\n4. The function g: [0, ∞) → ℝ is strictly monotonically increasing.\n5. The cost function c is arbitrary, defined as c: (𝒳×ℝ²)^m → ℝ ∪ {∞}.\n6. The function class ℱ is the RKHS associated with k, with functions expressed as f(·) = ∑β_i k(·, z_i) with finite norm.\n7. The norm ∥·∥ is the RKHS norm in ℋ associated with k.\n8. There exists a set of M real-valued functions {ψ_p} defined on 𝒳.\n9. The m×M matrix (ψ_p(x_i))_{i,p} has rank M.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that any minimizer ȳ = f + h (with f ∈ ℱ, h ∈ span{ψ_p}) of the regularized risk functional can be written as ∑α_i k(·,x_i) + ∑β_p ψ_p(·) with unique β_p.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So each line is one assumption. So, perhaps splitting these into individual points.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake, because in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants the format. So perhaps in the problem presented here, the assumptions should include all the conditions from Theorem 1 and the additional ones in Theorem 2. But how to split them into individual lines.\n\nLet me try to list them:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- 𝒳 is a nonempty set.\n- $k$ is a positive definite real-valued kernel on $\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X}$.\n- Samples $(\\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), \\ldots, (\\mathbf{x}_m, y_m) \\in \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ are given.\n- $g: [0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly monotonically increasing.\n- The cost function $c: (\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathbb{R}^2)^m \\to \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ is arbitrary.\n- The function class $\\mathcal{F}$ consists of functions in the RKHS associated with $k$ with finite norm.\n- The norm $\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert$ is the RKHS norm in $\\mathcal{H}$.\n- A set of $M$ real-valued functions $\\{\\psi_p\\}_{p=1}^M$ is defined on $\\mathcal{X}$.\n- The $m \\times M$ matrix $(\\psi_p(\\mathbf{x}_i))_{ip}$ has rank $M$.\n\nProblem: Prove that any minimizer $\\tilde{f} = f + h$ (with $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $h \\in \\text{span}\\{\\psi_p\\}$) of the regularized risk functional admits a representation $\\tilde{f}(\\cdot) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i k(\\cdot, \\mathbf{x}_i) + \\sum_{p=1}^M \\beta_p \\psi_p(\\cdot)$ with unique coefficients $\\beta_p$.\n\nBut the user's example used concise assumptions. For instance, in the example, assumptions were two lines: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user wants the key assumptions that are necessary for the theorem, not every single condition. But in the semi-parametric theorem, the key additional assumptions are the existence of the functions ψ_p and the rank condition. The rest are inherited from Theorem 1. But maybe in the structured format, the user wants all the necessary assumptions listed, even if they are from the previous theorem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem assumes that the conditions of Theorem 1 hold, and adds the new conditions. So in the problem statement, the user says \"in addition to the assumptions of the previous theorem\", so the assumptions would include those from Theorem 1 plus the new ones. Therefore, to structure the problem, we need to list all assumptions (from both Theorem 1 and the additional ones in Theorem 2) as individual lines.\n\nBut how detailed should each assumption be? For example, the function class ℱ is defined with specific properties. Should each of those properties be a separate assumption? The example had \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So each line is a separate condition. So in this case, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $\\mathcal{X}$ is a nonempty set.\n- $k: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a positive definite kernel.\n- Training samples $(\\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), \\ldots, (\\mathbf{x}_m, y_m) \\in \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ are provided.\n- $g: [0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly monotonically increasing.\n- The cost function $c$ is defined on $(\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathbb{R}^2)^m$ and takes values in $\\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$.\n- The function space $\\mathcal{F}$ is the RKHS associated with $k$ with elements expressible as $f(\\cdot) = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\beta_i k(\\cdot, \\mathbf{z}_i)$ where $\\beta_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbf{z}_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$, and $\\lVert f \\rVert < \\infty$.\n- The set $\\{\\psi_p\\}_{p=1}^M$ is a collection of real-valued functions on $\\mathcal{X}$.\n- The matrix $(\\psi_p(\\mathbf{x}_i))_{i=1,\\ldots,m; p=1,\\ldots,M}$ has rank $M$.\n- $\\tilde{f} = f + h$ where $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $h \\in \\text{span}\\{\\psi_p\\}$.\n\nBut perhaps some of these can be merged or split. The key is to have each assumption as a single line, addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nLet me try again, more concisely:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $\\mathcal{X}$ is a nonempty set.\n- $k$ is a positive definite real-valued kernel on $\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X}$.\n- Samples $(\\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), \\ldots, (\\mathbf{x}_m, y_m) \\in \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ are given.\n- $g: [0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly monotonically increasing.\n- The cost function $c: (\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathbb{R}^2)^m \\to \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ is arbitrary.\n- The function class $\\mathcal{F}$ is the RKHS associated with $k$ with finite norm.\n- A set $\\{\\psi_p\\}_{p=1}^M$ of real-valued functions on $\\mathcal{X}$ is provided.\n- The $m \\times M$ matrix $(\\psi_p(\\mathbf{x}_i))$ has full rank $M$.\n- The function $\\tilde{f} = f + h$ where $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $h \\in \\text{span}\\{\\psi_p\\}$.\n\nBut the problem statement in the user's example seems to combine the problem with the assumptions. However, the user's example had the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\", with assumptions listed separately. In this case, the problem is to prove the representation of $\\tilde{f}$. \n\nTherefore, the problem statement should be: Prove that any minimizer $\\tilde{f} = f + h$ of the regularized risk functional admits the representation $\\tilde{f}(\\cdot) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i k(\\cdot, \\mathbf{x}_i) + \\sum_{p=1}^M \\beta_p \\psi_p(\\cdot)$ with unique coefficients $\\beta_p$.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are all the conditions from the semi-parametric theorem, each as a separate line. The problem is the statement to prove.",
