    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to prove that if a function f satisfies f(x + π) = f(π - x) = f(x) for all real x, then the integral from 0 to infinity of f(x) times (sin x)/x dx equals the integral from 0 to π/2 of f(x) dx. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the given conditions. The function f is periodic with period π because f(x + π) = f(x). Additionally, it's symmetric about x = π/2 since f(π - x) = f(x). So f has both periodicity and symmetry. These properties might help simplify the integral.\n\nThe integral in question is ∫₀^∞ f(x) (sin x)/x dx. I know that the integral of sin x /x from 0 to infinity is π/2. But here it's multiplied by f(x), which complicates things. Since f is periodic with period π, maybe we can break the integral into a sum over each interval of length π. Let's try that.\n\nLet’s split the integral into integrals over [kπ, (k+1)π] for k = 0,1,2,... So:\n\n∫₀^∞ f(x) (sin x)/x dx = Σₖ=₀^∞ ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} f(x) (sin x)/x dx.\n\nSince f is periodic with period π, f(x) = f(x - kπ) when x is in [kπ, (k+1)π). Let me substitute x = t + kπ, where t ∈ [0, π). Then dx = dt, and the integral becomes:\n\nΣₖ=₀^∞ ∫₀^π f(t) [sin(t + kπ)] / (t + kπ) dt.\n\nBut sin(t + kπ) = sin t cos(kπ) + cos t sin(kπ) = sin t (-1)^k, because sin(kπ)=0 and cos(kπ)=(-1)^k. So sin(t + kπ) = (-1)^k sin t. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\nΣₖ=₀^∞ ∫₀^π f(t) [ (-1)^k sin t ] / (t + kπ) dt.\n\nFactor out the constants from the integral:\n\nΣₖ=₀^∞ (-1)^k ∫₀^π f(t) (sin t) / (t + kπ) dt.\n\nBut this looks complicated. Maybe there's a smarter approach. Let's consider the symmetry condition f(π - x) = f(x). If we make a substitution in the integral over [0, π], say x = π - t, then we might get a relationship that can be exploited.\n\nAlternatively, since the function is symmetric about π/2, maybe we can fold the integral over [0, π] into [0, π/2]. Let me try that for each interval.\n\nWait, but the original integral is from 0 to infinity. However, considering the periodicity, perhaps we can express the integral as an infinite sum of integrals over [0, π], each shifted by kπ. Then use the properties of f and the series sum.\n\nBut integrating over each period and summing up might lead to a telescoping series or something that can be simplified. Also, f is periodic, so maybe we can factor out f(t) from each integral and the sum becomes a sum over (-1)^k / (t + kπ), multiplied by f(t) sin t dt over [0, π].\n\nWait, but how do we handle the sum Σ (-1)^k / (t + kπ) for k from 0 to ∞? Maybe there's a known series that equals this sum. Let me recall that the sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (x + kπ) is related to the cosecant function. Specifically, I remember that Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (x + kπ) = 1/(2) csc(x/2 + π/2), but I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, consider the sum S = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (t + kπ). Let me consider the integral representation or some known series. Alternatively, using the fact that 1/(t + kπ) can be written as an integral. Maybe integrating e^{-(t + kπ)s} ds from 0 to ∞. Then interchange sum and integral. Let's try:\n\nS = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k ∫₀^∞ e^{-(t + kπ)s} ds = ∫₀^∞ e^{-ts} Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k e^{-kπ s} ds.\n\nThe sum inside is a geometric series with ratio -e^{-π s}, so Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-e^{-π s})^k = 1 / (1 + e^{-π s}).\n\nTherefore, S = ∫₀^∞ e^{-ts} / (1 + e^{-π s}) ds.\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps there's a Fourier series or a known identity. Wait, I recall that the sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (x + kπ) is equal to 1/(2) sec(x/2). Let me check for x = 0: sum becomes 1/π (1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ...) which diverges. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the expansion of secant. Wait, another approach: the sum S can be considered as the imaginary part of Σ (-1)^k e^{i x (t + kπ)}? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the function 1/(x + kπ). This resembles the poles of cotangent or something. Wait, the standard sum Σ_{k=-∞}^∞ 1/(x + kπ) is π cot(x), but that's for all integers k. But here we have k >= 0 and alternating signs. Let's see:\n\nΣ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (x + kπ) = (1/π) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (x/π + k).\n\nThis resembles the digamma function's series representation. Recall that ψ(z) = -γ + Σ_{n=0}^∞ [1/(n +1) - 1/(n + z)]. But not exactly. Alternatively, the series Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k/(k + a) is known and relates to the digamma function. Specifically, Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k/(k + a) = 1/2 [ψ((a +1)/2) - ψ(a/2)].\n\nBut this might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe integrating term by term. Let's consider integrating the sum S multiplied by f(t) sin t over t from 0 to π. So the original integral becomes ∫₀^π f(t) sin t [Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (t + kπ)] dt.\n\nIf we can show that Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (t + kπ) = 1/(2) sec(t/2), then integrating f(t) sin t * sec(t/2)/2 dt from 0 to π would equal the desired result. Wait, but sec(t/2) is 1/cos(t/2), so sin t / cos(t/2) = 2 sin(t/2) cos(t/2) / cos(t/2) = 2 sin(t/2). Therefore, the integrand becomes f(t) * 2 sin(t/2) * 1/2 = f(t) sin(t/2). Wait, but then the integral would be ∫₀^π f(t) sin(t/2) dt. But the problem states that the integral equals ∫₀^{π/2} f(t) dt. So something is not matching here. Maybe my assumption about the sum S is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, let's think differently. Given that f has period π and is symmetric about π/2, can we express f as a function that's even about π/2? That is, f(π - x) = f(x). So perhaps on [0, π], the function is symmetric around π/2. Therefore, the integral over [0, π] can be written as twice the integral from [0, π/2]. But since the function is periodic, the integrals over each [kπ, (k+1)π] would also relate to the integral over [0, π]. But how does this tie into the original integral with (sin x)/x?\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding f(x) in a Fourier series. Since f is periodic with period π, its Fourier series would involve terms like cos(2nx) and sin(2nx) because the period is π. But integrating term by term might be complicated. However, given the symmetry f(π - x) = f(x), the Fourier series would only contain cosine terms, since sine terms would vanish due to the even symmetry about π/2.\n\nBut even this approach might be involved. Let me look for another way. The integral ∫₀^∞ f(x) (sin x)/x dx is reminiscent of the Dirichlet integral, which is ∫₀^∞ sin x /x dx = π/2. But here it's modulated by f(x). Since f is periodic and symmetric, perhaps there's a way to exploit orthogonality or some integral transform.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the property that for periodic functions, the integral over all real numbers can be expressed as a sum over periods. Here, we have the integral from 0 to infinity, which can be written as a sum of integrals over each interval [kπ, (k+1)π]. As I tried earlier, substituting x = t + kπ in each interval gives:\n\n∫₀^∞ f(x) (sin x)/x dx = Σₖ=₀^∞ ∫₀^π f(t) [(-1)^k sin t]/(t + kπ) dt.\n\nSo factoring out the constants, this becomes Σₖ=₀^∞ (-1)^k ∫₀^π f(t) sin t / (t + kπ) dt.\n\nNow, if we can interchange the sum and the integral (which requires justification, like uniform convergence), then:\n\n∫₀^π f(t) sin t [Σₖ=₀^∞ (-1)^k / (t + kπ)] dt.\n\nSo the key is to compute the sum S(t) = Σₖ=₀^∞ (-1)^k / (t + kπ). If we can find a closed form for S(t), then we can proceed.\n\nLet me consider the function S(t). Let's write it as:\n\nS(t) = (1/t) Σₖ=₀^∞ (-1)^k / (1 + (kπ)/t).\n\nBut not sure if helpful. Alternatively, recall that Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (k + a) = 1/2 [ψ((a +1)/2) - ψ(a/2)] where ψ is the digamma function. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, note that:\n\nΣ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k e^{-kπ s} = 1/(1 + e^{-π s}}.\n\nBut previously, we had S(t) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-ts} / (1 + e^{-π s}) ds. Wait, if that's the case, then:\n\nS(t) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-ts} / (1 + e^{-π s}) ds.\n\nLet me compute this integral. Let’s make substitution u = e^{-π s}, so s = -ln u / π, ds = -du/(π u). Then when s=0, u=1; s=∞, u=0. So:\n\nS(t) = ∫₀^1 u^{t/π} / (1 + u) * (1/(π u)) du = (1/π) ∫₀^1 u^{(t/π) -1} / (1 + u) du.\n\nThis integral resembles the integral representation of the beta function or the digamma function. Specifically, ∫₀^1 u^{c-1}/(1 + u) du = 1/2 [ψ((c +1)/2) - ψ(c/2)]], but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, recall that ∫₀^1 u^{c-1}/(1 + u) du = β(c, 1 - c) for some conditions on c, but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, expand 1/(1 + u) as a power series:\n\n1/(1 + u) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n u^n for |u| <1.\n\nThen, S(t) = (1/π) Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n ∫₀^1 u^{(t/π) -1 + n} du = (1/π) Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (t/π + n).\n\nWhich is exactly S(t) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (t + nπ). So this brings us back to the original sum. Therefore, this approach doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the sum S(t) = (1/π) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (k + t/π).\n\nLet’s set a = t/π. Then S(t) = (1/π) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (k + a).\n\nThis sum is known to be related to the digamma function. Specifically:\n\nΣ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (k + a) = 1/2 [ψ((a +1)/2) - ψ(a/2)].\n\nBut how does this help? The digamma function ψ(z) is the derivative of ln Γ(z). However, I'm not sure if this leads to a simplification. Alternatively, recall that for a = 1, the sum becomes 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... = ln 2. But here, a is t/π. \n\nAlternatively, if I can relate this sum to a trigonometric function. Suppose we consider a Fourier series expansion or use contour integration. Alternatively, think about the series expansion of secant or tangent.\n\nWait, here's an idea. The sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (k + a) is equal to ∫₀^1 x^{a -1} / (1 + x) dx. Wait, this is similar to the integral we had earlier. Let me verify:\n\n∫₀^1 x^{a -1} / (1 + x) dx = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n ∫₀^1 x^{a -1 + n} dx = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (a + n).\n\nYes, exactly. So Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (k + a) = ∫₀^1 x^{a -1} / (1 + x) dx.\n\nTherefore, S(t) = (1/π) ∫₀^1 x^{t/π -1} / (1 + x) dx.\n\nBut I still don't see how to connect this to the desired integral. Let's take a step back.\n\nThe original problem states that the integral equals ∫₀^{π/2} f(x) dx. Let me compute this integral for a specific function f that satisfies the given conditions to see if the identity holds. For example, take f(x) = 1. Then f(x + π) = f(x) and f(π - x) = f(x), so it satisfies the conditions. Then the left-hand side becomes ∫₀^∞ (sin x)/x dx = π/2. The right-hand side is ∫₀^{π/2} 1 dx = π/2. So equality holds in this case. Good, the example works.\n\nAnother test case: Let f(x) = cos(2x). Wait, but f(x + π) = cos(2x + 2π) = cos(2x) = f(x), so periodic with period π. Also, f(π - x) = cos(2π - 2x) = cos(2x) = f(x). So it satisfies the conditions. Compute LHS: ∫₀^∞ cos(2x) (sin x)/x dx. This integral can be evaluated using integration by parts or recognizing it as the imaginary part of some Fourier transform. Alternatively, use the identity sin x cos 2x = [sin(3x) - sin(x)] / 2. So:\n\n∫₀^∞ [sin(3x) - sin x]/(2x) dx = (1/2)(π/2 - π/2) = 0. But the RHS is ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2x) dx = [sin(2x)/2] from 0 to π/2 = 0 - 0 = 0. So equality holds here as well. Interesting.\n\nAnother test case: f(x) = cos^2 x. Then f(x + π) = cos^2(x + π) = cos^2 x, and f(π - x) = cos^2(π - x) = sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x. Wait, but this would not equal cos^2 x unless cos^2 x = 1/2. So f(x) = cos^2 x does not satisfy the condition f(π - x) = f(x). So bad example. Choose f(x) = sin^2 x. Then f(π - x) = sin^2(π - x) = sin^2 x = f(x), and f(x + π) = sin^2(x + π) = sin^2 x, so periodic. Then LHS: ∫₀^∞ sin^2 x (sin x)/x dx = ∫₀^∞ (sin^3 x)/x dx. The integral of sin^3 x /x from 0 to ∞ can be evaluated using known integrals. But this might be more complex. Alternatively, note that sin^3 x = (3 sin x - sin 3x)/4. Thus:\n\n∫₀^∞ (3 sin x - sin 3x)/(4x) dx = (3/4)(π/2) - (1/4)(π/2) = (π/2)(3/4 - 1/4) = π/4. The RHS is ∫₀^{π/2} sin^2 x dx = (π/4). So equality holds. Another valid case. So the identity seems to hold for these examples.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's a general approach using the properties of f. Since f is periodic and symmetric, maybe expanding f in a Fourier series and integrating term by term. Let’s try that.\n\nExpress f(x) as a Fourier series. Since f has period π and is even about π/2, the Fourier series will consist of cosine terms with even harmonics. Let me clarify. The standard Fourier series for a function with period π is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ_{n=1}^∞ [a_n cos(2n x) + b_n sin(2n x)].\n\nBut since f is symmetric about π/2, i.e., f(π - x) = f(x), which implies that the Fourier series contains only cosine terms. Because the sine terms are odd about π/2. To see why, suppose f(π - x) = f(x). If we have a term sin(2n x), then sin(2n(π - x)) = sin(2nπ - 2n x) = -sin(2n x). So to satisfy f(π - x) = f(x), the coefficients of the sine terms must be zero. Therefore, f(x) = a_0 + Σ_{n=1}^∞ a_n cos(2n x).\n\nThus, we can write f(x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ a_n cos(2n x), where a_0 is the average value over [0, π], and the other coefficients are determined accordingly.\n\nNow, substitute this into the integral:\n\n∫₀^∞ f(x) (sin x)/x dx = Σ_{n=0}^∞ a_n ∫₀^∞ cos(2n x) (sin x)/x dx.\n\nEach term in the series can be evaluated using the integral ∫₀^∞ cos(a x) (sin x)/x dx. Let’s compute this integral. Recall that:\n\n∫₀^∞ (sin x)/x dx = π/2,\n∫₀^∞ cos(a x) (sin x)/x dx = ?\n\nWe can use integration by parts or recognize this as the imaginary part of ∫₀^∞ e^{i x} (sin x)/x dx. Alternatively, use the identity for product of sine and cosine.\n\nRecall that sin x cos(a x) = [sin((1 + a)x) + sin((1 - a)x)] / 2.\n\nThus,\n\n∫₀^∞ [sin((1 + a)x) + sin((1 - a)x)] / (2x) dx.\n\nEach integral is π/2 when the coefficient of x is positive. But we need to be careful about the signs. The integral ∫₀^∞ sin(k x)/x dx = π/2 if k > 0, and -π/2 if k < 0. However, since we are integrating from 0 to ∞, it's symmetric in k. So:\n\n∫₀^∞ sin(k x)/x dx = (π/2) sgn(k).\n\nTherefore, for our case:\n\nIf a ≠ 1, then:\n\n∫₀^∞ [sin((1 + a)x) + sin((1 - a)x)] / (2x) dx = (π/2)[sgn(1 + a) + sgn(1 - a)] / 2.\n\nBut a = 2n, where n is a non-negative integer. So a is even and non-negative. So 1 + a ≥ 1, so sgn(1 + a) = 1. For 1 - a, if a < 1, i.e., n=0 (a=0), then 1 - 0 =1, sgn=1. For a ≥ 2 (n ≥1), 1 - a ≤ -1, so sgn(1 - a) = -1.\n\nTherefore, for n=0 (a=0):\n\n∫₀^∞ cos(0) (sin x)/x dx = ∫₀^∞ (sin x)/x dx = π/2.\n\nFor n ≥1, a=2n:\n\n∫₀^∞ cos(2n x) (sin x)/x dx = (π/2)[1 + (-1)] / 2 = 0.\n\nTherefore, all terms for n ≥1 vanish, and only the n=0 term remains. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\nΣ_{n=0}^∞ a_n * (π/2 δ_{n0}) = a_0 * π/2.\n\nBut the Fourier series coefficient a_0 is the average of f over [0, π], so a_0 = (1/π) ∫₀^π f(x) dx.\n\nTherefore, the integral ∫₀^∞ f(x) (sin x)/x dx = a_0 * π/2 = (1/π) ∫₀^π f(x) dx * π/2 = (1/2) ∫₀^π f(x) dx.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the integral equals ∫₀^{π/2} f(x) dx. According to this, our result is (1/2) ∫₀^π f(x) dx. Therefore, we must have ∫₀^{π/2} f(x) dx = (1/2) ∫₀^π f(x) dx.\n\nBut is this true given the symmetry of f? Since f is symmetric about π/2, ∫₀^π f(x) dx = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} f(x) dx. Hence, (1/2) ∫₀^π f(x) dx = ∫₀^{π/2} f(x) dx. Therefore, the integral indeed equals ∫₀^{π/2} f(x) dx. Thus, the proof is complete via expanding f in Fourier series and using orthogonality.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Expand f in Fourier cosine series due to its symmetry and periodicity.\n2. Substitute into the integral and use orthogonality to show only the DC term contributes.\n3. Relate the DC term to the average value over [0, π], which by symmetry is twice the integral over [0, π/2].\n\nThus, the equality holds.",
