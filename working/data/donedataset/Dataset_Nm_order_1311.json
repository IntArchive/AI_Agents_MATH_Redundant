    "Content": "Lets say I have a function defined as $f(x) = \\sqrt {x^2}$. Common knowledge of square roots tells you to simplify to $f(x) = x$ (we'll call that $g(x)$) which may be the same problem, but it isn't the same equation. For example, say I put $-1$ into them: $\\begin{align}\nf(x) &= \\sqrt {x^2} \\\\\nf(-1) &= \\sqrt {(-1)^2} \\\\\nf(-1) &= \\sqrt {1} \\\\\nf(-1) &= 1\n\\end{align}$ $\\begin{align}\ng(x) &= x \\\\\ng(-1) &= -1\n\\end{align}$ thereby, we conclude that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ do not produce the same results even though they are mathematically the same. This is also shown when we try to graph the functions: $y = \\sqrt {x^2}$ : $y = x$ : $y = \\mid x \\mid$ : From this, we can see that given $f(x) = \\sqrt {x^2}$, when simplified is not the same as $f(x) = x$. So, is there any way to prove that $y = \\sqrt {x^2}$ is not the same as $y = x$ for negative values, but is infact the same as $y = \\mid x \\mid$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is the definition of square root of a number. The square root is defined in the sense that $s(x^2) = \\sqrt{ x^2 } = |x|$ for all real $x$. Thus, the domain is the real numbers and the codomain is the non-negative real numbers. The reason it is defined this way is to make sure that $s$ is a function. Assume for a minute that $s(x^2) = x$, then:\n$$\\sqrt{(-5)^2} = -5, \\qquad \\sqrt{5^2} = 5$$\nBut we know that $\\sqrt{(-5)^2} = \\sqrt{25} = \\sqrt{5^2}$. Thus we see that $s(25) = -5, 5$. And thus $s$ is not a function. To keep it as a function, we have to 'sacrifice' and say that $s(x^2) \\neq x$. Rather, $s(x^2) = |x|$. This will be consistent with the definition of a function. Since it is a definition, it cannot be proven. The problem is that many think that $\\sqrt {x^2} = x$ because we study positive numbers before we study negative numbers, which is understandable, because I used to make that mistake all the time.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, so I need to be precise and clear.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question on Math Stack Exchange. The title is \"Proving square root of a square is the same as absolute value.\" The user is questioning why f(x) = sqrt(x²) isn't the same as g(x) = x, especially for negative values, and wants to prove that it's actually equivalent to the absolute value function, |x|.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement is then restructured.\n\nIn the original problem here, the key assumptions would involve the definition of the square root function, which typically returns the non-negative root. So, even if x is negative, x² is positive, and the square root of a positive number is non-negative. Therefore, the function f(x) = sqrt(x²) would always yield |x|, not x itself when x is negative.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The square root function returns a non-negative value.\n- x is a real number (since square roots of real numbers are being considered, and x can be negative or positive).\n- The function f(x) is defined as sqrt(x²).\n- The function g(x) is defined as x.\n- The problem compares f(x) and g(x) for all real numbers x, especially negative ones.\n\nThe problem to state would be proving that f(x) = sqrt(x²) is equal to |x| and not equal to g(x) = x for negative x.\n\nWait, but the original question also mentions that they are \"mathematically the same\" but in reality, they aren't. Wait, actually, mathematically sqrt(x²) is |x|, not x. So the confusion here is thinking that simplifying sqrt(x²) would lead to x, but that's only true for x ≥ 0. Therefore, the problem is to prove that sqrt(x²) equals |x| and not x when x is negative.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions and problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a real number.\n- The square root function returns the principal (non-negative) root.\n- The function f(x) is defined as √(x²).\n- The function g(x) is defined as x.\n- The comparison is made over all real numbers x.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = √(x²) is not equal to g(x) = x for negative x, but is equal to |x| for all real x.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. \"x is a real number.\" – That's one assumption about x.\n2. \"The square root function returns the principal (non-negative) root.\" – Assumption about the square root.\n3. \"The function f(x) is defined as √(x²).\" – Definition of f.\n4. \"The function g(x) is defined as x.\" – Definition of g.\n5. \"The comparison is made over all real numbers x.\" – This might be redundant because x being real is already stated, but maybe it's necessary to clarify the domain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem doesn't state that x is real, but in the examples given, they use -1, which is real, so perhaps we can assume x is real. Also, the square root of x² is defined for all real x, so that's covered.\n\nI think the key assumptions are the definitions of f and g, and the square root's principal value. The problem is to show that f(x) equals |x| and not g(x) for negative x.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nThe square root function returns the principal (non-negative) root,\nf(x) is defined as √(x²),\ng(x) is defined as x,\nComparison is over all real numbers x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) = √(x²) is not equal to g(x) = x for negative x, but is equal to |x| for all real x.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the original question is asking to prove that sqrt(x²) is not the same as x for negative values, but is the same as |x|. So the problem statement in the formatted version should capture that. But maybe split into two parts: proving it's equal to |x| and not equal to x when x is negative.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as: Prove that f(x) = √(x²) is equal to |x| for all real x, and thus not equal to x when x is negative.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem line is a single statement. In their example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the problem is to show that sqrt(x²) is |x| and not x for negative x. But maybe the problem statement can be written as: Prove that √(x²) is equal to |x| for all real x, and thus f(x) ≠ g(x) when x < 0.\n\nBut in the original question, the user is more focused on showing that f(x) is not the same as g(x) for negatives, but is the same as |x|. So combining both aspects into the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, split into two parts, but the example shows one problem statement. Hmm.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is to prove equivalence to |x| and non-equivalence to x for negatives. So the problem statement can be structured as:\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = √(x²) is equal to |x| for all real x, and therefore not equal to g(x) = x when x is negative.\n\nBut maybe the problem can be split into two parts. However, the user's example combined two conditions (divisible by 7 and general integer n) but the formatted problem listed assumptions and then the problem. Here, the assumptions are the definitions and properties, and the problem is to show that f(x) equals |x| and not g(x) for negative x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that sqrt(x²) equals |x|, which inherently shows that it's not equal to x for negative x. So perhaps the problem is just to prove that sqrt(x²) equals |x|, which would then imply the inequality for negative x.\n\nBut the original question explicitly asks to prove that sqrt(x²) is not the same as x for negatives but is the same as |x|. So combining both.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem as a single statement. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = √(x²) is not equal to g(x) = x for negative values of x, but is equal to |x| for all real x.\n\nBut the example had the problem as a single sentence. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nSo the problem is to prove a single statement, but the assumptions include that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had to mention that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption? Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps that's a mistake? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example? Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't add \"n is divisible by 7\" unless it's a misapplication. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I have to follow it.\n\nBut in any case, for the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem into assumptions and problem statement.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a real number (since the examples given are real numbers, and we're dealing with square roots which are defined for non-negative reals, but x can be any real as x² is non-negative).\n\n2. The square root function returns the principal (non-negative) root. This is a key assumption because the square root symbol is defined to return the non-negative root.\n\n3. f(x) is defined as sqrt(x²).\n\n4. g(x) is defined as x.\n\n5. The comparison is made over all real numbers x. (Possibly redundant, but maybe necessary.)\n\nProblem statement: Prove that f(x) = sqrt(x²) is not equal to g(x) = x for negative values of x, but is equal to |x| for all real x.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be split into two parts: prove equality to |x| and inequality to x when x is negative. But according to the example, the problem is a single statement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nx is a real number,\nThe square root function returns the principal (non-negative) root,\nf(x) is defined as √(x²),\ng(x) is defined as x,\nComparison is over all real numbers x.\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) = √(x²) is not equal to g(x) = x for negative x, but is equal to |x| for all real x.\n\nBut maybe some assumptions can be merged. For instance, \"f(x) is defined as √(x²)\" and \"g(x) is defined as x\" are separate assumptions. Each addresses one function's definition. The square root's principal value is another assumption. x being real is another. The comparison over all real x is perhaps redundant because x is already real, but maybe needed.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not require all these assumptions. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question says: \"Prove that sqrt of a square is the same as absolute value.\" The user gives an example with x = -1, showing f(-1) = 1 vs. g(-1) = -1. So the problem is to show that sqrt(x²) = |x| and not x for negative x.\n\nThe key assumptions here are the definition of the square root function (principal root), and the domain of x (real numbers). The definitions of f and g are part of the problem setup.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The square root function returns the principal (non-negative) root.\n- f(x) = sqrt(x²).\n- g(x) = x.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) is equal to |x| for all real x and hence not equal to g(x) when x is negative.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is listed line by line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nThe square root function returns the principal (non-negative) root,\nf(x) is defined as √(x²),\ng(x) is defined as x.\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) = √(x²) is equal to |x| for all real x, and therefore not equal to g(x) when x is negative.\n\nOr, more succinctly:\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = √(x²) is not equal to g(x) = x for negative x, but is equal to |x| for all real x.\n\nYes, that's concise. The key is to list all necessary assumptions, each on their own line, and then state the problem.\n\nI think this should be correct. Let me double-check:\n\n- Each assumption is one line, one property or condition.\n- The problem is stated clearly.\n\nYes, that should work.",
