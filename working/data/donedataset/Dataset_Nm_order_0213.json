    "Content": "I understand that the quadratic equation can solve any second order polynomial. Furthermore, equations exist for polynomials up to fourth order. However, without a graduate level degree and a deep understanding of mathematics, is there an explanation of how we can prove that the equations for solutions to a fifth order and above don't exist? Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a very vague intuition for why such a proof might be possible. Many people are shocked when they hear that the general quintic cannot be solved.  \"What does that mean?\", they say. \"Just because many people have tried and failed does not mean that's impossible.  Flight was impossible until the Wright Brothers took off at Kitty Hawk...\", etc. etc.  But when we talk about solving the quintic, we are not talking about  as some Herculean task that only a genius can accomplish. We're just talking about something that, as it turns out, is not allowed according to the rules of the algebra game. One way of proving that a given task is impossible is to find something that stays the same when you perform any of the possible \"moves\" that are allowed.  For example, suppose you were teaching someone the rules of checkers, you play a couple games, and then you point out that a piece on a black square can never find its way to a white square.  \"What?!\", your friend bellows.  \"I don't see why not!  Flight was impossible until...\", etc.  But all you need to do to prove this simple fact is to observe that at any given time, none of the rules allow you to move from black to white. In the algebra game, you're given a polynomial $p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4+fx^5$ and you're allowed to manipulate the symbols $a,b,c,d,e,f$ and numbers $1,2, \\ldots$ in various ways.  For example, you can add $a$ and $b$ to get $a+b$; you're allowed to multiply, divide, etc.  This gives you what mathematicians call a field. You're also allowed to use the symbol $\\sqrt{}$, so to take square roots, cube roots, etc..  This lets you make complicated-looking expressions like $$\\sqrt[8]{\\frac{a + b \\sqrt{d +e^3}}{e-\\sqrt[4]{5}}}.$$  But to do this, you have to make your field bigger.  This is called a field extension.\nAs it turns out, there's a certain property that's always the same when you make field bigger by taking roots.  It's a little complicated to explain what - for that you must learn Galois theory.  But it's a little bit like the way a checker can't change colors. It turns out that for certain polynomials $p(x)$, you can prove that any field that contains any root of $p(x)$ doesn't have that property.  That means that you can spend all day playing with roots, etc., and you will never solve the general quintic.  A clever mathematician like Évariste Galois can see the whole game at once and realizes that your task is not possible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then, the problem statement itself is simplified.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is asking why we can prove that a formula to solve an (n+5) order polynomial doesn't exist. The question body mentions that quadratic equations can solve second-order polynomials, and there are formulas up to fourth order. The user is asking for an explanation, without requiring advanced math, of how we prove that such formulas don't exist for fifth-order and higher polynomials.\n\nNow, I need to extract assumptions. The example given in the prompt had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". However, in the current problem, the assumptions aren't immediately obvious. The original question is more about the existence of solutions via formulas (radicals) for higher-degree polynomials. \n\nThe key points here are:\n1. Polynomials of degree 2, 3, 4 have solutions using radicals.\n2. The Abel-Ruffini theorem states that there's no general solution in radicals for polynomials of degree five or higher.\n3. The question is about proving this non-existence.\n\nBut the user is asking for assumptions. Since the problem is about the non-existence of a general formula, the assumptions would relate to the degree of the polynomial. The original question mentions \"a formula to solve an (n+5) order polynomial does not exist.\" Wait, the title says \"(n+5) order\", but the body talks about fifth order and above. Maybe that's a typo, perhaps \"n\" here is meant to be a variable, but more likely, it's a misphrasing. The standard result is for degree 5 and higher. So maybe the original title should be fifth order, not (n+5). Alternatively, if the user intended (n+5) order, but that seems odd. However, the body clearly refers to fifth order and above. So perhaps the title has a typo. But since I need to structure the problem as given, I should stick to the original title's wording. However, the problem in the example had specific assumptions. Here, the question is about the proof of non-existence of a general solution formula for polynomials of degree n+5. Wait, maybe n here is a variable, but that's not standard. The standard result is for degree 5 and higher. So perhaps the title is incorrect. But regardless, the user's original question is as stated. \n\nBut the task is to structure the problem as per the format. The assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed. Since the problem is about proving that a formula doesn't exist for polynomials of degree (n+5), perhaps the assumptions are that we're considering polynomials of degree five or higher, or that n is a non-negative integer such that the degree is five or more. However, the example given in the prompt had specific numerical conditions. But in this case, the problem is more general. Let me think again.\n\nThe original problem's assumptions would be the conditions under which the proof is applicable. The Abel-Ruffini theorem applies to polynomials of degree five or higher. So the assumption here would be that we're considering polynomials of degree five or higher. But the problem is to prove that such a formula doesn't exist. However, the way the user phrased the title is \"Why can we prove mathematically that a formula to solve an (n+5) order polynomial does not exist?\" So perhaps the assumption is that the polynomial is of order (n+5), where n is a non-negative integer. But that would make the degree variable depending on n. However, the standard theorem applies to any polynomial of degree five or higher, regardless of how it's parameterized. Alternatively, maybe the user meant to write \"fifth-order\" instead of \"(n+5) order\". But since the user provided that exact title, I need to work with it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that for each n ≥ 0, there's no general solution in radicals for polynomials of degree n+5. But that's redundant because once you have degree ≥5, there's no solution. So n could be zero, making it fifth degree. So the assumption here would be that n is a non-negative integer, and the polynomial is of degree n+5. But I need to list each assumption line by line. So possible assumptions:\n\n- The polynomial is of degree n+5, where n is a non-negative integer.\n- The polynomial has real coefficients (though Abel-Ruffini applies to complex coefficients as well, but maybe the user is considering real polynomials).\nBut the problem as stated doesn't specify these. The original question doesn't mention any specific conditions on the polynomial coefficients, just the degree. So perhaps the only assumption is that the polynomial is of degree five or higher, but the title says (n+5). Wait, maybe the user intended to write \"fifth-order\" but mistyped it as \"(n+5) order\". Alternatively, maybe they meant that for any n ≥0, a polynomial of degree n+5 doesn't have a general solution. But that's essentially the same as saying degree ≥5. So the key assumption here is the degree of the polynomial being five or higher.\n\nBut the example given in the prompt had specific numerical conditions. However, in this case, the problem is more about the general impossibility. So perhaps the assumption is simply that the polynomial is of degree five or higher. But in the original question's title, it's phrased as \"(n+5) order polynomial\", which might imply that n is some variable, but without more context, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a translation error or a typo. Given that the body of the question mentions fifth order and above, I think the intended assumption is that the polynomial is of degree five or higher. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the original problem's assumptions, which included divisibility by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, wait, the original problem in the example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's incorrect. The example might have been a bad example. Because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an extra condition. That's a problem. Maybe the example was wrong. But the user provided that example, so perhaps the task is to extract the assumptions from the original problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That's conflicting. Because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added that n must be divisible by 7. This suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect. But maybe the user intended to modify the problem? Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. For example, maybe the original problem had an extra condition, but the user in the example mistakenly added the divisibility by 7. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a different problem where the original problem had n divisible by 7, but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". That would be conflicting. So this suggests that perhaps the example provided by the user is not accurate. However, given that the user provided that example, I need to follow their structure.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The original question's title is \"Why can we prove mathematically that a formula to solve an (n+5) order polynomial does not exist?\" and the body discusses fifth order and above. The key assumption here is that we are considering polynomials of degree five or higher. But the title mentions (n+5) order, which might mean that n is a non-negative integer, making the degree start at 5 when n=0. So possible assumptions:\n\n- The polynomial is of degree (n + 5), where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nAlternatively, since the body refers to fifth order and above, perhaps the assumption is:\n\n- The polynomial is of degree five or higher.\n\nBut the example in the prompt added an assumption that wasn't explicitly stated in the original problem. For example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. So maybe the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. However, in the current case, the problem is about the non-existence of a general solution formula for polynomials of a certain degree. The only assumption here is the degree of the polynomial. Therefore, the assumption would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial is of degree five or higher.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a general formula to solve the polynomial using radicals does not exist.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the title's wording \"an (n+5) order polynomial\", then:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial is of degree (n + 5), where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a general formula to solve such a polynomial using radicals does not exist.\n\nBut given that the body of the question mentions fifth order and above, and the Abel-Ruffini theorem applies to degree five and higher, it's more accurate to state the assumption as the polynomial being of degree five or higher. However, the title mentions (n+5), so perhaps combining both. Let me check the original question again:\n\nTitle: Why can we prove mathematically that a formula to solve an (n+5) order polynomial does not exist?\n\nQuestion: ... equations exist for polynomials up to fourth order. However, ... fifth order and above ...\n\nSo the user is using \"n+5\" in the title but \"fifth order and above\" in the body. This suggests that \"n+5\" is intended to mean \"fifth order when n=0, sixth when n=1, etc.\" So the assumption would be that the polynomial is of degree five or higher, parameterized as n+5 where n is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The polynomial is of degree (n + 5), where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that a general formula to solve the polynomial using radicals does not exist.\n\nBut the example in the prompt included multiple assumptions, each on a separate line. However, in this case, there's only one assumption: the degree of the polynomial. So the formatted problem would have that one assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if there are multiple assumptions, but I can't think of others. The problem doesn't specify coefficients being real or complex; Abel-Ruffini applies regardless. So the main assumption is the degree.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial is of degree five or higher.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a general formula to solve the polynomial using radicals does not exist.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the title's (n+5) literally:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial is of degree (n + 5), where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a general formula to solve such a polynomial using radicals does not exist.\n\nBut considering the body mentions fifth order and above, the first version is more accurate. However, the user's title uses (n+5), so perhaps it's better to follow that. But I need to reconcile both. Maybe the user intended to ask about polynomials of degree five and higher, and the (n+5) is a way to express that for n ≥0, the degree is five or more. So combining these, the assumption would be:\n\n- The polynomial is of degree (n + 5), where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut that's redundant because if n is non-negative, n+5 ≥5. Alternatively, the problem could be parameterized with n starting from 0, leading to degrees 5,6,...\n\nSo I'll go with that.",
