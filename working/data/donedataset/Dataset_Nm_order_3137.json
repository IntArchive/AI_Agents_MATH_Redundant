    "Content": "Let $f,g$ be Holder continuous functions with respective exponents $\\alpha, \\beta \\in (0,1)$. More precisely $f \\in C^{\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^n;\\mathbb{R}^n)$, $g\\in C^{\\beta}(\\mathbb{R}^n,\\mathbb{R})$. I am wondering whether the composition $g \\circ f:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is Holder of exponent $\\min \\{\\alpha,\\beta \\}$, i.e, if $g \\circ f \\in C^{\\min\\{\\alpha,\\beta \\}}(\\mathbb{R}^n;\\mathbb{R})$. This is claimed on a paper I am reading but I don't know how to prove it. The naive approach would be: $$\n|g(f(x+h))-g(f(x))| \\le [g]_{\\beta}|f(x+h)-f(x)|^{\\beta} \\le [g]_{\\beta} |h|^{\\beta \\alpha} [f]^{\\beta}_{\\alpha}\n$$ so we have $g \\circ f \\in C^{\\alpha \\beta }(\\mathbb{R}^n)$. But $\\alpha \\beta < \\min \\{\\alpha,\\beta\\}$, so this is not very helpful. Any help would be welcome. Thak you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In fact, $\\alpha\\beta$ is optimal. To prove it, let $f,g:[0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ with $f(x)=x^\\alpha$ and $g(x)=x^\\beta$. Note that $f\\circ g\\in C^{\\alpha\\beta}$, however, for all $\\gamma>\\alpha\\beta$, $f\\circ g$ does not belong to $C^\\gamma$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about whether the composition of two Hölder continuous functions, f and g, is also Hölder continuous with exponent equal to the minimum of their exponents, α and β. The user mentioned that the naive approach gives a worse exponent (αβ) and they need help proving the claimed result.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The function f is Hölder continuous with exponent α ∈ (0,1). So, f ∈ C^α(ℝⁿ; ℝⁿ). That's one assumption about f.\n2. The function g is Hölder continuous with exponent β ∈ (0,1). So, g ∈ C^β(ℝⁿ, ℝ). That's another assumption about g.\n3. The composition in question is g∘f: ℝⁿ → ℝ. We need to state the problem about this composition.\n\nThe problem is to prove that g∘f is Hölder continuous with exponent min{α, β}. The original problem mentions that the paper claims this, but the user's attempt only gets αβ. So the main task is to show the composition has the minimum exponent.\n\nWait, but in the assumptions, do we need to mention anything else? The original problem states f and g are Hölder with exponents in (0,1). The domains and codomains are specified: f maps from ℝⁿ to ℝⁿ, and g maps from ℝⁿ to ℝ. These are part of the assumptions about the functions. So each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a function from ℝⁿ to ℝⁿ.\n- f is Hölder continuous with exponent α ∈ (0,1).\n- g is a function from ℝⁿ to ℝ.\n- g is Hölder continuous with exponent β ∈ (0,1).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption about one object (f or g) and their properties.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that the composition g∘f is Hölder continuous with exponent min{α, β}.\n\nWait, the user's problem states \"whether the composition... is Holder of exponent min{α, β}\". The user is asking if this is true, as it's claimed in a paper but they can't prove it. So the problem is to prove that statement.\n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are the conditions on f and g, and the problem is to prove the composition's Hölder exponent.\n\nI need to check if there's any other implicit assumptions. For example, the Hölder seminorms? But the user didn't mention specific constants, just the exponents. So maybe the specific constants aren't needed here, just the exponents.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from ℝⁿ to ℝⁿ,\nf is Hölder continuous with exponent α ∈ (0,1),\ng is a function from ℝⁿ to ℝ,\ng is Hölder continuous with exponent β ∈ (0,1).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the composition g∘f: ℝⁿ → ℝ is Hölder continuous with exponent min{α, β}.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"g∈C^{β}(ℝⁿ,ℝ)\" and \"f∈C^{α}(ℝⁿ;ℝⁿ)\", so the codomains are important here. The composition g∘f makes sense because f outputs in ℝⁿ and g takes inputs from ℝⁿ, so that's valid. So the assumptions about the domains and codomains are necessary to ensure the composition is possible. Therefore, each of those should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo each line in the Assumption section is:\n\n- f is a function from ℝⁿ to ℝⁿ.\n- f is Hölder continuous with exponent α ∈ (0,1).\n- g is a function from ℝⁿ to ℝ.\n- g is Hölder continuous with exponent β ∈ (0,1).\n\nThat's four separate assumptions. Each addresses one property or condition of one object (either f or g).\n\nYes, that should be correct. The problem is then to show the composition is Hölder with exponent min{α, β}.",
