    "Content": "If for all $r\\in(0,1)$ we know that $U\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^n$ can be represented as a union of open balls of radius $r$ , do we know that it can be represented as a union of open balls of radius $1$ ? This is obviously true for $n=1$ and in general case I have proven that a dense subset of $U$ can be represented as a union of open balls of radius $1$ . Is the hypothesis true for all $n$ in the original, stronger, form? EDIT: I assume the Euclidean, i.e. $\\ell^2$ norm, but if you have results with any other norm or metric they are welcome!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It seems that the property is true in dimension 2. Let $U$ a non-empty open strict subset of $\\mathbb R^2$ that is a union of open balls of radius $r$ for all $r\\in(0,1)$ . Part 1: there is always a center nearby For all $x\\in U$ , there exists a sequence $(c_n)$ in $U$ such that $x\\in B(c_n,1-1/n)\\subset U$ . As a bounded sequence in $\\mathbb R^2$ , it has an accumulation point $c$ and it is easy to see that $B(c,1)\\subset U$ (using triangular inequality), but $x$ might be on its boundary. Note $C=\\{c\\in U:B(c,1)\\subset U\\}$ . Let $x_0$ be such a point in $U$ outside all ball of radius 1 in $U$ . Part 2: outsiders must be surrounded If $x_0$ is not in the convex hull of the intersection of $C$ and the closed ball $\\overline B(x_0,1)$ , then there exists a line $d$ that separates them. Using its equation $\\langle x-x_0,v\\rangle=-1$ , there exists a sequence $(c_n)$ such that $y_n=x_0+\\frac 1nv\\in \\overline B(c_n,1)\\subset U$ but these centers must lay on the half plane given by $\\langle c_n-x_0,v\\rangle\\ge 0$ (not containing $d$ ) hence the same holds for any accumulation point on the semi-circle of center $x_0$ and radius 1, which is contradictory. Part 3: the only way out is right in the middle By Caratheodory's theorem, $x_0$ lies in a triangle whose vertices are in $C\\cap\\overline B(x,1)$ . Precisely, $x_0$ is the circumcenter of this triangle. If $x_0$ belongs to the interior of this triangle, then the open ball of radius 1 around the orthocenter $H$ satisfy $x_0\\in B(H,1)\\subset \\bigcup_{i=1}^3 B(c_i,1)\\subset U$ (by isogonal conjugation), which is contradictory. So $x_0$ is the middle of a segment $[c_1,c_2]$ of length 2 between two centers in $C$ . Part 4: four exterior points blocks the balls Since we cannot move any radius 1 ball closer to $x_0$ , for all $i\\in\\{1,2\\}$ there exists a chord between elements in $U^{\\mathrm c}$ on $S(c_i,1)$ that intersects the segment $[c_i,x_0]$ . Otherwise, we could separate the segment and $U^{\\mathrm c}\\cap S(c_i,1)$ by a line and move the ball in the direction of a normal vector of the line, to attain $x$ . These two chords are the opposite edges of a non-self-crossing quadrilateral. Part 5: the stone was a diamond Since $U$ is open, there exists $r>0$ such that $B(x_0,r)\\subset U$ . The points in the intersection $I$ of this ball and the perpendicular bisector of $[c_1, c_2]$ (and distinct of $x_0$ ) must be at distance less or equal to 1 to the center of a unitary ball in $U$ . But such a ball cannot contain $x_0$ nor the ends of the chords, so its center $c$ must be outside the balls around $c_1$ and $c_2$ , and reach the points in $I$ through the other sides of the quadrilateral. Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in $I\\setminus\\{x_0\\}$ converging to $x_0$ from both sides in $I$ . Then there two (symmetric) accumulation points $c_3$ and $c_4$ , giving a rectangle $c_1c_3c_2c_4$ . Therefore the chords are diameters and the quadrilateral formed by exterior points is a lozenge with two sides parallel to $[c_1,c_2]$ . Conclusion The center of each side of the lozenge is in $C$ , so the union of the four corresponding unitary balls contains a unitary ball containing $x_0$ (with a center on the largest diagonal).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and present it in the specified format with Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFirst, the original question is asking whether if a set U in R^n can be written as a union of open balls of radius r for every r < 1, does it follow that U can be written as a union of open balls of radius 1. The user mentions that it's true for n=1 and that they proved a dense subset of U can be covered with radius 1 balls. They also mention using the Euclidean norm but are open to other norms.\n\nSo, I need to extract the assumptions. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. U is a subset of R^n.\n2. For every r in (0,1), U is a union of open balls of radius r.\n3. The norm used is Euclidean (they mentioned it in the edit, but also said other norms are welcome, but the main problem is about the Euclidean case).\n\nThe problem is to determine whether U can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1.\n\nWait, but the original question's title is phrased as a question: \"U is union of r-balls, ∀ r<1 ⇒ U is union of 1-balls?\" So the problem is to prove or disprove this implication.\n\nNow, in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about U being in R^n, for all r in (0,1) U is a union of open r-balls, and using the Euclidean norm. The problem is to see if U can be written as union of 1-balls.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list these assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address one property. Let me check:\n\nAssumptions:\n- U is a subset of R^n.\n- For every r in (0,1), U can be represented as a union of open balls of radius r.\n- The open balls are defined using the Euclidean (ℓ²) norm.\n\nProblem: Determine if U can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"do we know that it can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1?\" So the problem is to prove or find a counterexample whether the condition holds.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that...\". Here, since it's a question of whether it's true, maybe the problem is \"Determine whether U can be represented...\".\n\nAlternatively, the user might be asking for a proof or disproof. But the format requires the problem statement. So perhaps the problem is \"Prove or disprove that U can be represented...\".\n\nBut in the example, the problem was \"Prove that...\", but in this case, it's a question, so maybe the problem should be \"Is it true that U can be represented...\".\n\nBut the user's example used \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the problem is phrased as a statement to prove, even if the original question is a yes/no question. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem had \"Prove that...\" even though the original problem was to prove for every integer n. But in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So maybe the user modified the problem, perhaps mistakenly? Or perhaps the example was a different case. Hmm, maybe the example was structured with incorrect assumptions. But regardless, the task here is to structure the given problem correctly.\n\nIn the current case, the user's original question is: If U can be represented as union of open balls of radius r for every r <1, does it follow that it can be represented as union of open balls of radius 1? The user also mentions assuming Euclidean norm but open to others.\n\nBut for the assumptions, we need to list each condition. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. U is a subset of R^n.\n2. For every real number r such that 0 < r < 1, U is a union of open balls of radius r.\n3. The open balls are defined using the Euclidean (ℓ²) norm.\n\nThe problem is to determine whether U can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1.\n\nBut the user's edit says \"I assume the Euclidean, i.e. ℓ² norm, but if you have results with any other norm or metric they are welcome!\" So the primary assumption is Euclidean, but the problem is still about Euclidean unless specified otherwise. However, since the user included that edit, maybe the problem should mention the Euclidean norm as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nU is a subset of R^n,\nFor every r in (0,1), U is a union of open balls of radius r,\nThe open balls are defined using the Euclidean norm.\n\nProblem: Determine if U can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is phrased as a yes/no question, but the example used \"Prove that...\", maybe it's better to phrase it as \"Prove or disprove that U can be represented...\".\n\nBut the original example had \"Prove that...\" even though the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. The original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might have been a mistake in the example. So perhaps the example is not a perfect guide, but the instruction is to structure the problem by listing all assumptions line by line and then state the problem.\n\nSo in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- U is a subset of R^n.\n- For all r in (0,1), U can be expressed as a union of open balls of radius r.\n- The open balls are with respect to the Euclidean norm.\n\nThe problem is to determine whether U can be expressed as a union of open balls of radius 1.\n\nBut the original question is asking \"do we know that it can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1?\" So the problem is to prove or disprove this statement.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have the problem statement as \"Prove or disprove that U can be represented...\".\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", even when the original problem may have had a condition. Perhaps the example was incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, we need to follow the format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That might be an error, but we have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nSo, to structure this correctly:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. U is a subset of R^n.\n2. For every real number r where 0 < r < 1, U is a union of open balls of radius r.\n3. The open balls are defined using the Euclidean (ℓ²) norm.\n\nProblem: Determine whether U can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is phrased as a question, perhaps \"Is it true that U can be represented...\", but the example used \"Prove that...\". However, since the original question is a yes/no question, maybe the problem should be \"Prove or disprove that U can be represented...\".\n\nBut the example given by the user had the original problem's conclusion as the problem statement with added assumptions. So in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, making the problem to prove under that condition. So perhaps here, the key is to take the original problem's conditions and list them as assumptions, then state the problem.\n\nThe original problem's conditions are:\n\n- U is a subset of R^n.\n- For every r in (0,1), U is a union of open balls of radius r.\n- Euclidean norm is used.\n\nProblem: Can U be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1?\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that...\", so perhaps here, even if the original question is a yes/no, the problem is to \"Prove that U can be represented...\" given the assumptions, or \"Determine whether...\"?\n\nBut the example's original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem had \"Prove that A(n)...\" with added assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to show filtering unrelated info. Maybe the original problem had a mistake, but in any case, following the user's example, the problem statement is \"Prove that...\".\n\nBut in the current case, the problem is not to prove but to determine if the implication holds. So perhaps the problem should be phrased as \"Prove or disprove that U can be represented...\".\n\nAlternatively, if the answer is known (but the user hasn't stated it), but the problem is just to structure the question as per the format, then the problem is as stated.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nU is a subset of R^n,\nFor every r in (0,1), U is a union of open balls of radius r,\nThe open balls are defined using the Euclidean norm.\n\nProblem: Determine whether U can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1.\n\nAlternatively, if following the example where the problem is to \"Prove that...\", but here it's a yes/no question, perhaps it's better to phrase as \"Prove or disprove that...\".\n\nBut the user's example used \"Prove that...\", even when the original problem was a general statement. Maybe the answer should follow that style, so perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that U can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1.\n\nBut since the original question is asking whether this is true, perhaps it's better to use \"Determine whether...\".\n\nHowever, the example's problem was a direct statement to prove, even though the original problem had a universal quantifier. The user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which may have been a mistake. But given that, perhaps in this case, the correct approach is to list the assumptions as given and then state the problem as a question to prove or determine.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" with the example. The example took the original problem, filtered unrelated info, and restated it with assumptions and problem.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem's main question is: If U can be written as union of r-balls for all r <1, can it be written as union of 1-balls?\n\nThe assumptions are:\n\n- U ⊆ R^n\n- For all r ∈ (0,1), U is a union of open balls of radius r\n- Euclidean norm\n\nProblem: Can U be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1?\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement is phrased as \"Prove that...\". However, in this case, since it's a question of whether it's true, maybe the problem should be \"Prove or disprove...\".\n\nBut the example didn't include \"Prove or disprove\"; it just said \"Prove that...\". So maybe the user wants to structure it as a statement to prove, assuming the answer is yes. But since the original problem is asking whether it's true, perhaps the correct way is to structure it as a question to prove or disprove.\n\nBut since the user's example transformed the original problem (which was to prove for all n) into a problem with an added assumption (n divisible by 7), perhaps there was a misunderstanding. However, in this case, the problem as stated by the user on Math Stack Exchange is exactly as given, and we need to structure it without adding or removing conditions, just filtering unrelated info.\n\nThe original question includes:\n\n- Title: U is union of r-balls, ∀ r<1 ⇒ U is union of 1-balls?\n- Question body: Restates the title, mentions n=1 is true, and dense subset covered by 1-balls, asks if original hypothesis is true for all n. Edit mentions Euclidean norm but open to other norms.\n\nUnrelated information would be the mention of the dense subset and the edit about other norms, unless the problem specifically requires considering other norms. However, the main question is about Euclidean norm. The dense subset part is the user's own progress, which is not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo filtering out the dense subset part and the edit's mention of other norms (since the primary assumption is Euclidean), the assumptions are:\n\n1. U is a subset of R^n.\n2. For every r in (0,1), U is a union of open balls of radius r.\n3. The open balls are defined using the Euclidean norm.\n\nProblem: Can U be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1?\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the problem should be phrased as \"Prove that U can be represented...\" or \"Determine whether U can be represented...\".\n\nHowever, in academic contexts, problems are often phrased as \"Prove or disprove...\" when it's an open question. Since the user is asking whether the hypothesis is true, the correct phrasing would be \"Prove or disprove that U can be represented...\".\n\nBut given the example, which took a universal statement and turned it into a \"Prove that...\" with added assumptions, perhaps here the problem is to \"Prove that U can be represented...\", given the assumptions. However, the user's own edit says \"I assume the Euclidean...\", so that should be included as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nU is a subset of R^n,\nFor every r in (0,1), U is a union of open balls of radius r,\nThe open balls are defined using the Euclidean (ℓ²) norm.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that U can be represented as a union of open balls of radius 1.\n\nAlternatively, if the answer is known (but I don't know it), but the structure is just to present the problem as is, then it's acceptable.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem statement is a direct \"Prove that...\" even if the original was a universal statement. So perhaps here, since the original question is a yes/no, but the answer isn't given, the problem should be to \"Prove or disprove...\".\n\nI think that's the most accurate way. So the final answer should have the three assumptions listed and the problem to prove or disprove the representation with radius 1 balls.",
