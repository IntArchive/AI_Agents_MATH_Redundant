    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question again. The user is asking about the convergence or divergence of the series sum from n≥1 of sin(π√(n²+1)). They also provided their own solution approach, which involves rewriting the sine term using some trigonometric identities and then applying the alternating series test.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given lists each assumption on a separate line, addressing one property or condition for one object. Let me think about the key elements here. The series is an alternating series because of the (-1)^n term introduced in their solution. Also, the sequence b_n = sin(π/(√(n²+1) + n)) is mentioned to monotonically decrease to 0. These seem like the critical assumptions that are being used to apply the alternating series test.\n\nSo the assumptions should include that the series is alternating, which comes from the (-1)^n factor, and that the sequence b_n is monotonically decreasing and approaches zero. Each of these should be separate points. Let me check: the problem statement as posed in the original question doesn't mention these assumptions; they are part of the user's solution. But when structuring the problem, do I include the assumptions that are part of the problem's setup or those used in the solution?\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed the assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example seems to have two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so perhaps there was a mistake there. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. The example might have had a typo or error. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is showing how to structure a problem that originally had some additional conditions. Maybe in the original problem, the user might have had a version where n is divisible by 7, but the example given here seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscommunication. But regardless, following the user's example, the formatted problem should list assumptions that are part of the problem's conditions, not the solution's steps. However, in the provided example, the user's original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the original problem was different? Let me check again.\n\nThe example says the original problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That's conflicting because \"for every integer n\" doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. So the example seems to be wrong. That complicates things because the user's example might be incorrect, but I need to follow their format. However, in the current problem, the user's solution introduces the alternating nature and the decreasing sequence. But the original problem as stated is just the series sum sin(π√(n²+1)). So the user's own solution transforms the general term into an alternating series. But the problem itself, as posed, doesn't mention the (-1)^n term; that comes from the user's approach. Therefore, when structuring the problem, should those assumptions be included?\n\nWait, according to the user's instructions, I should \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem as per the format. The example given by the user includes an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be in the original problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's listed as an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, but I need to follow their format. However, in the current problem, the user's question is about the series sum sin(π√(n²+1)), and their solution transforms it into an alternating series. So the key points here are that the series is alternating, and the sequence inside the sine is decreasing to zero. Therefore, in the problem statement, the assumptions would be that the terms can be written as (-1)^n times a monotonically decreasing sequence approaching zero. But the original problem didn't state that; it's part of the solution. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions should be derived from the problem's given information.\n\nWait, but how do I know? The user wants to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem. So in the example, they took the original problem which had an expression involving 5^n, 6^n, etc., and the formatted problem listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the original problem, it was stated as \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is an integer is correct. But the second assumption about n being divisible by 7 is not in the original problem. So perhaps the example is wrong. But maybe in their example, they wanted to highlight that even though the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the actual divisibility by 91 might require n to be divisible by 7, hence the assumption. However, I'm not sure. This is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps, in the current problem, the original question is just to determine convergence/divergence of the series sum sin(π√(n²+1)), and the user provided their solution approach. The task is to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement. The problem as posed in the title and question doesn't mention anything about alternating series or the sequence decreasing; that's part of the user's solution. Therefore, to structure the problem, perhaps the assumptions are only those given in the problem, not the solution. However, the example provided by the user included assumptions from the solution, like n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. So maybe the user's intention is to structure the problem based on the solution's approach, extracting the necessary conditions or transformations made in the solution as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to parse the original problem and extract implicit assumptions. For example, in the series sum sin(π√(n²+1)), the terms involve sqrt(n²+1), which is close to n for large n. So sin(π sqrt(n²+1)) ≈ sin(π(n + 1/(2n))) = sin(nπ + π/(2n)) = (-1)^n sin(π/(2n)) using trig identities. Therefore, the general term behaves like (-1)^n times a term approaching zero. So the series is alternating for large n. But in the original problem, there's no explicit mention of this; the user's solution brings this out. Therefore, perhaps the key assumptions here are that the series can be expressed as an alternating series with terms decreasing to zero, which are required for the convergence via the alternating series test.\n\nHowever, the problem as posed is to determine convergence/divergence of the given series. So if I follow the example's approach, where assumptions include properties used in the solution, then in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The series is alternating (due to the (-1)^n factor introduced by the trigonometric identity)\n- The sequence b_n = sin(π/(√(n²+1) + n)) is monotonically decreasing\n- The sequence b_n approaches zero as n approaches infinity\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each of these would be separate assumptions.\n\nBut the problem statement in the formatted version would then be \"Prove convergence/divergence of the series sum_{n≥1} sin(π√(n²+1))\", with the assumptions being that the series is alternating, the terms are decreasing, and the terms approach zero. However, in the example, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Therefore, perhaps the user's approach is to list the conditions that are necessary to apply the solution method as assumptions, even if they are derived from the problem's terms rather than explicitly given.\n\nTherefore, in this case, structuring the problem would involve stating the problem as the original question and then listing the key conditions that allow the solution to proceed, which are:\n\n1. The series can be expressed as an alternating series.\n2. The sequence b_n = sin(π/(√(n²+1) + n)) is monotonically decreasing.\n3. The sequence b_n approaches zero as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be one line, one property, applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series is alternating,\nThe sequence $b_n = \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{n^2+1} + n}$ is monotonically decreasing,\nThe sequence $b_n$ approaches zero as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove convergence/divergence of the series $$\\sum_{n\\ge1} \\sin (\\pi \\sqrt{n^2+1})$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In the current problem, the original question didn't state any assumptions; it's just the series. But the solution approach uses the alternating nature and the decreasing sequence. So maybe the user wants the assumptions derived from the problem's terms, not the problem's explicit conditions. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are properties inherent to the series, which are necessary for applying the convergence test.\n\nBut how do I know which ones to list? The example might be misleading. Given that in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. That makes sense. Then the second assumption in the example, \"n is divisible by 7\", is not present in the original problem, which is confusing. Unless perhaps the example was a mistake, and the original problem actually had n divisible by 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to list the necessary conditions for the conclusion. For instance, to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, the assumptions are that n is an integer and maybe n satisfies some other condition. But since the example is conflicting, it's hard to tell. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, the key assumptions are those that are necessary to apply the convergence test, i.e., that the series is alternating, the terms decrease monotonically, and the terms approach zero. Therefore, those would be the assumptions.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is asking for convergence/divergence, so perhaps the problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the series definition. However, in their solution, they transformed the general term into an alternating series. Therefore, the key step is recognizing the series is alternating, which comes from the trigonometric identity. Hence, the assumption would be that the series can be written as an alternating series, which is derived from the problem's terms. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions as:\n\n- The series $\\sum_{n\\ge1} \\sin (\\pi \\sqrt{n^2+1})$ is alternating.\n- The sequence $b_n = \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{n^2+1} + n}$ is monotonically decreasing.\n- The sequence $b_n$ approaches zero as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, in the solution, the user rewrote the original sine term as $(-1)^n \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{n^2+1} + n}$, which introduces the alternating factor. So the series is alternating because of that transformation. Therefore, the first assumption is inherent in the problem's structure, but not explicitly stated. Therefore, to structure the problem according to the example, the assumptions would include that the series is alternating, and the sequence inside the sine is decreasing to zero.\n\nBut since the problem as posed doesn't mention these, but the solution does, perhaps the user wants the assumptions that are used in the solution to be listed. Therefore, following the example where assumptions included conditions used in the proof (even if not stated in the original problem), we list them here.\n\nSo, final answer would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{n\\ge1} \\sin (\\pi \\sqrt{n^2+1})$ is alternating,\nThe sequence $b_n = \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{n^2+1} + n}$ is monotonically decreasing,\nThe sequence $b_n$ approaches $0$ as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that the series $$\\sum_{n\\ge1} \\sin (\\pi \\sqrt{n^2+1})$$ converges.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove convergence/divergence. However, the solution shows that it converges. So maybe the problem is to prove convergence, given the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem remains as \"prove convergence/divergence\", with the assumptions being the necessary conditions. But the example's problem statement was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", with assumptions. So perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove convergence, given the assumptions that the series is alternating, and the terms decrease to zero.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state those assumptions; they were derived in the solution. However, in the user's example, they took the original problem's conditions (n is an integer) and added another condition (n divisible by 7) which might be part of the actual problem's hidden assumptions. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's example where assumptions included both the given conditions and those derived in the solution (like n divisible by 7), perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are the ones derived in the solution, i.e., that the series is alternating and the sequence decreases to zero. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking for convergence/divergence, and the solution uses these assumptions. So, to format the problem as per the example, we list these as assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake, but if the user wants us to follow that structure, perhaps even if it's incorrect, then here we need to list the assumptions from the solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example was a mistake, and the correct approach is to list only the assumptions given in the problem. The original problem here doesn't state any assumptions; it's just the series. Therefore, there are no explicit assumptions. But that conflicts with the example, which lists assumptions even when the original problem didn't mention them. So I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, looking back, the example's formatted problem includes the assumption that n is an integer, which is stated in the original problem (\"for every integer n\"). The second assumption, that n is divisible by 7, was not in the original problem, which is confusing. Unless the original problem was mistyped. Maybe the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem would correctly list the assumptions. But the user's example shows the original problem as \"for every integer n\", which makes the formatted problem's assumption of n divisible by 7 incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the example has a typo, and the user intended to present a different original problem.\n\nIn any case, given the current problem, perhaps the correct approach is to list the key properties that are used in the solution as assumptions, even if they are derived from the problem's terms. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The series can be written as an alternating series.\n- The sequence $b_n = \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{n^2+1} + n}$ is monotonically decreasing.\n- The sequence $b_n$ approaches zero as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove convergence of the series.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is asking for convergence/divergence, not just convergence. However, the solution shows it converges. So maybe the problem is to prove convergence, given the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem remains as \"prove convergence/divergence\", but with the assumptions listed. But I think the key is that the user wants the problem structured with assumptions that allow applying the alternating series test. Therefore, the assumptions would be the alternating nature, monotonic decrease, and limit approaching zero.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $\\sum_{n\\ge1} \\sin (\\pi \\sqrt{n^2+1})$ is alternating,\nThe sequence $b_n = \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{n^2+1} + n}$ is monotonically decreasing,\nThe sequence $b_n$ approaches $0$ as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that the series $$\\sum_{n\\ge1} \\sin (\\pi \\sqrt{n^2+1})$$ converges.\n\nHowever, the problem as originally stated is to determine convergence or divergence, but the formatted problem in the example changes it to \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So maybe here, the problem should be \"Prove convergence/divergence of the series...\", but the assumptions are the ones necessary for the proof. However, the example includes assumptions not present in the original problem, so maybe we need to follow that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are derived from the problem's terms. For example, the original series involves sin(π√(n²+1)), and through manipulation, it's shown to be equivalent to an alternating series with terms decreasing to zero. Therefore, the assumptions are inherent properties of the series.\n\nBut to adhere strictly to the example's format, even if it's flawed, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The series is alternating.\n- The sequence $b_n = \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{n^2+1} + n}$ is monotonically decreasing.\n- The sequence $b_n$ approaches zero.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove convergence.\n\nI think that's the best approach here, even if the example seems contradictory. The user's example included assumptions from the solution, so I'll follow that pattern.",
