    "Content": "Using only the delta definition of a limit, how can we prove that the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$, where $a_n = \\sin n$, as $n$ tends to infinity does not have a limit? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No need for $\\epsilon$ actually.\nIf $\\sin(n) \\rightarrow l$, then $\\sin(n+1)$ also, and $\\sin(n+1)=\\sin(n)\\cos(1)+\\sin(1)\\cos(n)$.\nSince both $\\sin(n)$ and $\\sin(n+1)$ have limit $l$ and $\\sin(1) \\neq 0$, $\\cos(n) \\rightarrow \\frac{l(1-\\cos(1))}{\\sin(1)}$, and so $e^{in}=\\cos(n)+i \\sin(n)$ has a limit.\nBut $e^{i(n+1)}$ must then have the same limit (call it $x$), which implies $x=e^{i} x$, and since $e^{i} \\neq 1$, $x$ has to be zero, which is a contradiction with the fact that $|e^{in}|=1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem according to the given example. Let me read through the user's question again to make sure I understand it properly. The question is about proving that the limit of sin(n) as n approaches infinity does not exist, using only the delta definition of a limit. The user wants the problem structured with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I should list the assumptions. The original problem says \"using only the delta definition of a limit\" and refers to the sequence {a_n} where a_n = sin(n) as n tends to infinity. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, for this problem, the main objects are the sequence {a_n}, the term a_n itself, and the limit definition. \n\nAssumptions would include:\n1. The sequence is defined by a_n = sin(n). Each assumption should be one line, so that's one.\n2. The proof must use the delta definition of a limit. Since the problem specifies using only the delta definition, that's another assumption.\n3. The problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity. So, n tends to infinity.\n\nWait, do I need to split these into separate lines? For instance, the delta definition is a method, so that's a condition on the proof technique. The sequence's definition is another. Also, the problem is about the limit not existing, so perhaps the domain of n being integers? Because n is an integer here, since it's a sequence index. The original problem says \"as n tends to infinity\" which in sequences typically assumes n is a positive integer approaching infinity. So maybe that's another assumption: n is a positive integer. But the example given in the original didn't include that for the integer n, but in the example problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe here, n being an integer is an assumption.\n\nSo compiling all possible assumptions:\n\n- {a_n} is a sequence where a_n = sin(n) for each positive integer n.\n- The proof must use the delta-epsilon definition of the limit of a sequence.\n- n approaches infinity (i.e., considering the limit as n becomes arbitrarily large).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, since the sequence is defined for n in positive integers, that's implicit. But perhaps the user wants explicit assumptions. So, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nthe sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = sin(n),\nthe proof must use the delta-epsilon definition of the limit.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included both the variable being an integer and another condition. So here, since the problem is about the sequence, n is a positive integer. So yes, that's an assumption. Then the definition of a_n. Then the method of proof. But the example's assumption included the divisibility condition, which was part of the problem's setup. Here, the method (delta definition) is part of the problem's constraints. So in the problem statement, the user specifies \"using only the delta definition of a limit\", so that's a condition on the proof method.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. The sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = sin(n).\n3. The proof must use the delta-epsilon definition of a limit.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that the limit does not exist. The original problem doesn't have any additional constraints on n except that it tends to infinity, which is part of the limit. So maybe the assumption is that we are considering the limit as n approaches infinity. But that's part of the problem statement. Hmm.\n\nIn the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So the assumptions were about the variable's properties. Here, the problem is about the sequence, so the assumptions would be the properties of the sequence and the conditions on the proof.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example had the assumption that n is an integer, which is necessary for the problem's context. Similarly, here, the sequence is defined for integers n, so that's an assumption. Additionally, the method of proof is required (delta definition), which is another assumption.\n\nSo, structured:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nthe sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = sin(n),\nthe proof must use the delta definition of a limit.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of {a_n} as n approaches infinity does not exist.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the problem statement included the expression and the conclusion. Here, the problem is to prove non-existence of the limit. So perhaps the problem statement is as given, and the assumptions are the conditions under which this problem is posed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = sin(n) for each positive integer n.\n- The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n- The proof must use the delta-epsilon definition of a limit.\n\nBut I need to follow the user's example. In their example, the assumptions were two separate lines: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. The problem was then to prove divisibility by 91. So each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn this problem, the objects are the sequence {a_n}, the term a_n, and the method of proof. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\nEach term a_n of the sequence is defined as sin(n),\nn is a positive integer,\nthe proof must use the delta-epsilon definition of a limit.\n\nBut the original problem says \"using only the delta definition of a limit\", so that's a constraint on the method. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = sin(n) for each positive integer n,\nthe proof must use the delta-epsilon definition of the limit of a sequence.\n\nBut then, do we need to include that n approaches infinity? Well, that's part of the problem statement, which is \"as n tends to infinity\". So maybe the problem statement includes that.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = sin(n) for each positive integer n,\nthe proof must use the delta-epsilon definition of the limit of a sequence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of {a_n} as n tends to infinity does not exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"n approaches infinity\" is an assumption, but that's part of the problem statement. The example's problem statement included \"for every integer n\", which was part of the problem. So perhaps in this case, the problem statement is \"Prove that the limit of sin n as n approaches infinity does not exist\", and the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- the sequence is defined by a_n = sin(n),\n- the proof uses the delta definition.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an expression with n, and the assumption was n is an integer. So here, since the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity of sin(n), where n is an integer, that's an assumption. Also, the method of proof is another assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. The sequence {a_n} is defined by a_n = sin(n).\n3. The proof must use the delta-epsilon definition of a limit.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the limit does not exist as n approaches infinity.\n\nI think that covers it. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. The first two define the sequence, and the third specifies the proof technique. The problem statement includes the rest.",
