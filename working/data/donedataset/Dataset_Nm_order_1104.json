    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this determinant problem. The user wants to prove that the determinant of a certain 3x3 matrix involving sines of angles in a triangle is always zero without expanding it directly. The angles A, B, C are angles of a triangle, so they must satisfy A + B + C = π. That's a key point here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of determinants. If a determinant is zero, that means the rows (or columns) are linearly dependent. So maybe there's a linear combination of the rows or columns that results in the zero vector. Alternatively, there might be some symmetry or trigonometric identities that can simplify the matrix to a form where the linear dependence becomes obvious.\n\nLooking at the matrix structure:\n\nRow 1: sin(2A), sin C, sin B\n\nRow 2: sin C, sin(2B), sin A\n\nRow 3: sin B, sin A, sin(2C)\n\nSince A, B, C are angles of a triangle, they sum to π. Maybe using that A + B + C = π can help relate the angles. Also, the double angles like 2A, 2B, 2C might be connected to some identities.\n\nAnother thought: the sine rule relates the sides of a triangle to the sines of their opposite angles. The user mentioned they tried the sine rule but didn't get anywhere. Maybe instead, consider other trigonometric identities.\n\nLet me think about the sum of angles. For example, 2A + 2B + 2C = 2π. But I'm not sure how that directly helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express sin(2A) as 2 sin A cos A. Let me try substituting that into the matrix. Then the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 1: 2 sin A cos A, sin C, sin B\n\nRow 2: sin C, 2 sin B cos B, sin A\n\nRow 3: sin B, sin A, 2 sin C cos C\n\nHmm. Now, maybe there's a way to factor out terms or find a combination. Alternatively, consider the sum of the rows or columns.\n\nWait, if I can find that one row is a linear combination of the others, that would make the determinant zero. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we try to add all the rows. Let's compute the sum of the first entries: 2 sin A cos A + sin C + sin B. Similarly for the other entries. Not sure if that sums to something useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the relationship between the angles. Since A + B + C = π, maybe express one angle in terms of the others. For example, C = π - A - B. Then sin C = sin(A + B). But not sure if that substitution would help here.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that in a triangle, the sines of the angles are proportional to the lengths of the opposite sides. Let’s denote the sides opposite angles A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. Then by the sine rule, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C, where R is the circumradius. Maybe substituting sin A = a/(2R), etc., but the user mentioned they tried sine rule without success. Maybe this substitution complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express the determinant in terms of vectors. The determinant is the scalar triple product of the row vectors. If they are linearly dependent, the scalar triple product is zero. So perhaps find a non-trivial linear combination of the rows that gives zero.\n\nLet me denote the rows as R1, R2, R3. Suppose there exist constants k1, k2, k3, not all zero, such that k1 R1 + k2 R2 + k3 R3 = 0. If such constants exist, determinant is zero.\n\nAlternatively, check if one row can be expressed as a combination of others. Let's see:\n\nLooking at R1: [2 sin A cos A, sin C, sin B]\n\nR2: [sin C, 2 sin B cos B, sin A]\n\nR3: [sin B, sin A, 2 sin C cos C]\n\nIs there a relation here? For example, maybe if we multiply each row by some factor related to the angles. Alternatively, consider the variables sin A, sin B, sin C, and cos A, cos B, cos C.\n\nAlternatively, think of the determinant as a function of A, B, C with A + B + C = π. Perhaps substitute C = π - A - B and see if the determinant simplifies, but that might be messy.\n\nWait, another idea: Use complex numbers. Express sines in terms of exponentials. But that might not be helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, consider the matrix and see if it's a product of two matrices whose product has rank less than 3, leading to determinant zero.\n\nAlternatively, think of the columns. Let me check the columns:\n\nColumn 1: sin 2A, sin C, sin B\n\nColumn 2: sin C, sin 2B, sin A\n\nColumn 3: sin B, sin A, sin 2C\n\nSimilarly, maybe columns are related. For example, if we can express column 3 as a combination of columns 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, check if the columns satisfy some relation. For example, maybe column 1 + column 2 = column 3 multiplied by something. But I need to check with actual values.\n\nWait, let's take a specific triangle to test the determinant. For example, take an equilateral triangle where A = B = C = π/3. Then compute the determinant:\n\nsin(2π/3) = sin(120°) = √3/2\n\nsin C = sin(π/3) = √3/2\n\nsin B = same.\n\nSo the matrix becomes:\n\nRow 1: √3/2, √3/2, √3/2\n\nRow 2: √3/2, √3/2, √3/2\n\nRow 3: √3/2, √3/2, √3/2\n\nSo determinant is zero because all rows are the same. That works. But this is just a specific case. Need to show it's always zero.\n\nAnother example: take a right-angled triangle, say A = π/2, B = π/4, C = π/4.\n\nCompute sin 2A = sin π = 0\n\nsin C = sin π/4 = √2/2\n\nsin B = same.\n\nSo matrix:\n\nRow 1: 0, √2/2, √2/2\n\nRow 2: √2/2, sin(2B) = sin(π/2) = 1, sin A = 1\n\nRow 3: √2/2, 1, sin(2C) = sin(π/2) = 1\n\nCompute determinant:\n\nFirst row: 0, √2/2, √2/2\n\nSecond row: √2/2, 1, 1\n\nThird row: √2/2, 1, 1\n\nThe second and third rows are identical, so determinant is zero. Another case works. But need a general proof.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe consider that in a triangle, angles satisfy A + B + C = π, so 2A + 2B + 2C = 2π. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use trigonometric identities to relate elements. For example, sin 2A = 2 sin A cos A. Let me substitute that into the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 2 sin A cos A, sin C, sin B\n\nRow 2: sin C, 2 sin B cos B, sin A\n\nRow 3: sin B, sin A, 2 sin C cos C\n\nNow, perhaps express cos A in terms of other angles. Since A = π - B - C, cos A = -cos(B + C) = sin B sin C - cos B cos C. Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, use the fact that in a triangle, cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc), but that's the cosine rule, might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the matrix, each diagonal element is a double angle sine, and the off-diagonal elements are sines of the other angles. Maybe there's a relationship between the diagonal elements and the off-diagonal ones.\n\nWait, another approach: use the fact that the determinant is a skew-symmetric function or has some symmetry. But the matrix isn't symmetric or skew-symmetric. However, maybe some permutation of rows or columns can reveal symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perform row or column operations to simplify the determinant. For instance, subtract a multiple of one row from another to create zeros.\n\nLet me try that. Let's denote the matrix as M with entries M_ij.\n\nFirst, try to create zeros in the first column. Let's look at Row 1: 2 sin A cos A, sin C, sin B\n\nRow 2: sin C, 2 sin B cos B, sin A\n\nRow 3: sin B, sin A, 2 sin C cos C\n\nSuppose I multiply Row 1 by something and subtract from Row 2 or 3. Not sure. Alternatively, notice that sin C = sin (π - A - B) = sin(A + B). So maybe express sin C in terms of sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B.\n\nSimilarly, sin B = sin (π - A - C) = sin(A + C) = sin A cos C + cos A sin C.\n\nBut this might get too involved. Let me try substituting sin C = sin(A + B) into the matrix.\n\nSo, in Row 1, sin C = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B\n\nSimilarly, in Row 2, sin C is also sin(A + B). So maybe express sin C as sin A cos B + cos A sin B in the matrix entries.\n\nSimilarly, other entries can be expressed in terms of sums of angles. Let me see if that leads to any simplification.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in a triangle, angles are related, so perhaps express all angles in terms of two variables. Let’s set A = α, B = β, then C = π - α - β. Then, rewrite the matrix in terms of α and β. But this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, look for a vector that when multiplied by the matrix gives zero. If such a non-trivial vector exists, determinant is zero. Suppose the vector is [x, y, z]. Then:\n\nx sin 2A + y sin C + z sin B = 0\n\nx sin C + y sin 2B + z sin A = 0\n\nx sin B + y sin A + z sin 2C = 0\n\nLooking for non-trivial solutions. Maybe try x = sin A, y = sin B, z = sin C. Let's see:\n\nFirst equation: sin A sin 2A + sin B sin C + sin C sin B = sin A * 2 sin A cos A + 2 sin B sin C\n\n= 2 sin² A cos A + 2 sin B sin C\n\nSecond equation: sin A sin C + sin B sin 2B + sin C sin A = 2 sin A sin C + sin B * 2 sin B cos B\n\n= 2 sin A sin C + 2 sin² B cos B\n\nThird equation: sin A sin B + sin B sin A + sin C sin 2C = 2 sin A sin B + sin C * 2 sin C cos C\n\n= 2 sin A sin B + 2 sin² C cos C\n\nNot sure if this leads to zero. Maybe not the right choice.\n\nAlternatively, consider the vector [1, 1, 1]. Let's check:\n\nFirst entry: sin 2A + sin C + sin B\n\n= 2 sin A cos A + sin C + sin B\n\nBut in a triangle, C = π - A - B, so sin C = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B\n\nTherefore, sin 2A + sin C + sin B = 2 sin A cos A + sin A cos B + cos A sin B + sin B\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that in a triangle, angles are related, and use substitution. Let me try substituting C = π - A - B in the matrix. Then sin C = sin(A + B), and sin 2C = sin(2π - 2A - 2B) = -sin(2A + 2B). But this might not help directly.\n\nWait, another idea: use the identity sin 2A + sin 2B + sin 2C = 4 sin A sin B sin C. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the determinant as a function of A, B, and C, and show that it's identically zero under the constraint A + B + C = π. Maybe take partial derivatives or consider specific substitutions, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, here's another approach. Since the determinant is zero for any angles A, B, C that sum to π, perhaps consider variable substitution. Let’s set x = A, y = B, z = C, with x + y + z = π. Then express the determinant in terms of x, y, z and see if it simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the determinant is a skew-symmetric function or has some cyclic symmetry. The matrix seems to have cyclic symmetry in A, B, C. Maybe if we cyclically permute A→B→C→A, the determinant remains the same, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider adding all the rows together. Let's compute the sum of the first entries: sin 2A + sin C + sin B. Since C = π - A - B, sin C = sin(A + B). So sin 2A + sin(A + B) + sin B = 2 sin A cos A + sin A cos B + cos A sin B + sin B. Not obviously simplifying.\n\nWait, maybe factor out sin A from some terms: 2 sin A cos A + sin A cos B + sin B (cos A + 1). Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: if I can find that the rows satisfy a certain relationship. For example, maybe Row 1 + Row 2 + Row 3 = something. Let's compute:\n\nRow1 + Row2 + Row3:\n\nsin2A + sinC + sinB,\n\nsinC + sin2B + sinA,\n\nsinB + sinA + sin2C\n\nBut since A + B + C = π, perhaps there are identities for these sums. For example, sin2A + sin2B + sin2C = 4 sinA sinB sinC. But this sum is different.\n\nAlternatively, note that sin2A = 2 sinA cosA, so sin2A + sin2B + sin2C = 2(sinA cosA + sinB cosB + sinC cosC). But again, not directly helpful.\n\nWait, maybe use the identity sin2A = 2 sinA cosA and substitute into the matrix, then factor out sinA, sinB, sinC from rows or columns. Let's try:\n\nMatrix becomes:\n\n[2 sinA cosA, sinC, sinB]\n\n[sinC, 2 sinB cosB, sinA]\n\n[sinB, sinA, 2 sinC cosC]\n\nNow, suppose I factor out sinA from the first row, sinB from the second row, sinC from the third row. But that would require dividing each row by sinA, sinB, sinC respectively, which are non-zero (since angles are between 0 and π). However, determinant properties allow factoring out scalars from rows, but each row is scaled by a different factor. The determinant would then be multiplied by sinA sinB sinC. But unless the remaining matrix has determinant zero, this might not help. Let me see:\n\nIf we factor out sinA from Row1, sinB from Row2, sinC from Row3, the matrix becomes:\n\n[2 cosA, sinC/sinA, sinB/sinA]\n\n[sinC/sinB, 2 cosB, sinA/sinB]\n\n[sinB/sinC, sinA/sinC, 2 cosC]\n\nThis seems complicated. But maybe using the sine rule here. In a triangle, a/sinA = b/sinB = c/sinC = 2R. So sinA/a = sinB/b = sinC/c = 1/(2R). So sinA = a/(2R), etc. Thus, sinB/sinA = b/a, sinC/sinA = c/a, etc. So substituting these ratios:\n\nMatrix becomes:\n\n[2 cosA, c/a, b/a]\n\n[c/b, 2 cosB, a/b]\n\n[b/c, a/c, 2 cosC]\n\nNow, if we multiply the first row by a, second row by b, third row by c, the determinant would be multiplied by a*b*c. But this is allowed if we factor out a from Row1, b from Row2, c from Row3. Then the matrix becomes:\n\n[2 a cosA, c, b]\n\n[c, 2 b cosB, a]\n\n[b, a, 2 c cosC]\n\nNow, this matrix might have some known properties. For example, in a triangle, we have the Law of Cosines: a² = b² + c² - 2bc cosA, so 2 a cosA = (b² + c² - a²)/ (b). Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom Law of Cosines: cosA = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)\n\nThus, 2 a cosA = (b² + c² - a²)/b\n\nSimilarly, 2 b cosB = (a² + c² - b²)/c\n\nAnd 2 c cosC = (a² + b² - c²)/a\n\nSo substituting these into the matrix:\n\nRow1: (b² + c² - a²)/b, c, b\n\nRow2: c, (a² + c² - b²)/c, a\n\nRow3: b, a, (a² + b² - c²)/a\n\nThis seems more complicated, but maybe there's a pattern here. Let's denote the entries as follows:\n\nM11 = (b² + c² - a²)/b\n\nM12 = c\n\nM13 = b\n\nM21 = c\n\nM22 = (a² + c² - b²)/c\n\nM23 = a\n\nM31 = b\n\nM32 = a\n\nM33 = (a² + b² - c²)/a\n\nNow, perhaps this matrix has a determinant of zero. Let me check for specific values. Take an equilateral triangle where a = b = c. Then each diagonal entry becomes (a² + a² - a²)/a = a²/a = a. So the matrix is:\n\n[a, a, a]\n\n[a, a, a]\n\n[a, a, a]\n\nDeterminant is zero, which matches. For the right-angled triangle example, say a=1, b=1, c=√2 (but angles would be π/2, π/4, π/4). Then:\n\nRow1: (1 + 2 -1)/1 = 2, √2, 1\n\nRow2: √2, (1 + 2 -1)/√2 = 2/√2 = √2, 1\n\nRow3: 1, 1, (1 +1 -2)/1 = 0\n\nSo matrix:\n\n[2, √2, 1]\n\n[√2, √2, 1]\n\n[1, 1, 0]\n\nCalculating determinant:\n\n2*(√2*0 - 1*1) - √2*(√2*0 -1*1) +1*(√2*1 - √2*1)\n\n= 2*(-1) - √2*(-1) +1*(0)\n\n= -2 + √2 +0\n\nBut √2 ≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, which is not zero. Wait, but earlier when I computed with angles, the determinant was zero. Contradiction? That means there must be a mistake in the transformation.\n\nWait, perhaps my substitution using the sine rule was flawed. Because when I replaced sinB/sinA with b/a, etc., that assumes a,b,c are the sides of the triangle. However, when I tested with the right-angled triangle, if angles are π/2, π/4, π/4, then sides would be 1,1,√2. But in that case, sinA = sin(π/2)=1, sinB=sin(π/4)=√2/2, sinC=√2/2. So sinB/sinA= (√2/2)/1=√2/2=1/√2, which is a/b=1/1=1. Wait, but a=1, b=1, c=√2. So sinB/sinA= (√2/2)/1=1/√2, but a/b=1/1=1. So sinB/sinA=1/√2≠a/b. This inconsistency shows that my substitution was incorrect. Because in the sine rule, a/sinA = b/sinB = c/sinC=2R, so sinB/sinA = b/a. But in the example, sinB/sinA= (√2/2)/1=√2/2, and b/a=1/1=1. These are not equal. Therefore, my substitution was wrong. Therefore, that approach is invalid. So that path is incorrect.\n\nHmm, back to square one. Let's try another approach. Maybe consider that the determinant is a combination of terms that cancel each other out. Let me attempt to expand the determinant symbolically.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n\n| a b c |\n\n| d e f |\n\n| g h i |\n\nis a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).\n\nApplying this to the given matrix:\n\nFirst row: sin2A, sinC, sinB\n\nSecond row: sinC, sin2B, sinA\n\nThird row: sinB, sinA, sin2C\n\nDeterminant D is:\n\nsin2A*(sin2B*sin2C - sinA*sinA) - sinC*(sinC*sin2C - sinA*sinB) + sinB*(sinC*sinA - sin2B*sinB)\n\nBut expanding this would be very tedious. However, maybe there's cancellation.\n\nAlternatively, use trigonometric identities to simplify each term.\n\nFirst term: sin2A*(sin2B sin2C - sin²A)\n\nSecond term: - sinC*(sinC sin2C - sinA sinB)\n\nThird term: + sinB*(sinC sinA - sin2B sinB)\n\nLet me handle each part step by step.\n\nFirst term:\n\nsin2A*sin2B*sin2C - sin2A*sin²A\n\nSecond term:\n\n- sinC*sinC*sin2C + sinC*sinA*sinB\n\nThird term:\n\n+ sinB*sinC*sinA - sinB*sin2B*sinB\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n= [sin2A sin2B sin2C] - [sin2A sin²A] - [sin²C sin2C] + [sinC sinA sinB] + [sinB sinC sinA] - [sinB sin2B sinB]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nNote that [sinC sinA sinB] + [sinB sinC sinA] = 2 sinA sinB sinC\n\nThe other terms are:\n\nsin2A sin2B sin2C - sin2A sin²A - sin²C sin2C - sin²B sin2B\n\nNow, need to see if these terms cancel out.\n\nBut this seems complex. Let's see if there's a way to factor or use identities.\n\nFirst, note that sin2A = 2 sinA cosA, similarly for others.\n\nSubstitute:\n\nFirst term: 8 sinA cosA sinB cosB sinC cosC\n\nSecond term: -2 sinA cosA * sin²A\n\nThird term: -2 sinC cosC * sin²C\n\nFourth term: -2 sinB cosB * sin²B\n\nPlus 2 sinA sinB sinC\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n8 sinA cosA sinB cosB sinC cosC - 2 sin^3 A cosA - 2 sin^3 B cosB - 2 sin^3 C cosC + 2 sinA sinB sinC\n\nThis seems messy, but maybe factor out 2 sinA sinB sinC:\n\nLet me factor 2 sinA sinB sinC from all terms:\n\n= 2 sinA sinB sinC [4 cosA cosB cosC - (sin²A / (sinB sinC)) cosA - (sin²B / (sinA sinC)) cosB - (sin²C / (sinA sinB)) cosC + 1]\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a different identity or approach.\n\nWait, another idea: use the fact that in a triangle, A + B + C = π, so we can use trigonometric identities related to triangle angles. For example, in a triangle, cosA = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc), but this relates to sides again. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity sin2A + sin2B + sin2C = 4 sinA sinB sinC. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, consider that since A + B + C = π, we can express one angle's sine in terms of the others. For example, sin2C = sin2(π - A - B) = sin(2π - 2A - 2B) = -sin(2A + 2B). Then, sin2C = -sin2(A + B) = -[sin2A cos2B + cos2A sin2B]. Maybe substitute this into the determinant.\n\nBut this might not lead to cancellation.\n\nAlternatively, use complex exponentials. Express each sine term as (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ})/(2i). But this could get very involved.\n\nWait, let's consider specific relationships. For example, in any triangle, we have relationships like sinA + sinB + sinC = 4 cos(A/2)cos(B/2)cos(C/2). Not sure if helpful here.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the matrix has rank 2, so its determinant is zero. To show rank 2, find two rows that are linear combinations of the others. For example, see if Row3 can be expressed as a combination of Row1 and Row2.\n\nLet me assume there exist scalars α and β such that Row3 = α Row1 + β Row2.\n\nSo:\n\nsinB = α sin2A + β sinC\n\nsinA = α sinC + β sin2B\n\nsin2C = α sinB + β sinA\n\nThis is a system of equations for α and β. If such α and β exist for all A, B, C with A + B + C = π, then determinant is zero.\n\nBut solving this system generally seems difficult. However, perhaps using the angle sum condition.\n\nLet’s assume A + B + C = π. Maybe find α and β in terms of angles.\n\nFrom first equation: α = (sinB - β sinC)/sin2A\n\nFrom second equation: sinA = α sinC + β sin2B\n\nSubstitute α from first equation:\n\nsinA = [(sinB - β sinC)/sin2A] * sinC + β sin2B\n\nMultiply through by sin2A:\n\nsinA sin2A = (sinB - β sinC) sinC + β sin2B sin2A\n\nRearranged:\n\nsinA sin2A - sinB sinC = β [ - sin²C + sin2B sin2A ]\n\nSimilarly, from third equation: sin2C = α sinB + β sinA\n\nSubstitute α from first equation:\n\nsin2C = [(sinB - β sinC)/sin2A] * sinB + β sinA\n\nMultiply through by sin2A:\n\nsin2C sin2A = sin²B - β sinB sinC + β sinA sin2A\n\nRearrange:\n\nsin2C sin2A - sin²B = β [ - sinB sinC + sinA sin2A ]\n\nNow we have two expressions for β. For the system to be consistent, these two expressions for β must be equal. This seems too involved unless there's a specific relationship.\n\nAlternatively, consider specific angles where we can compute α and β. For example, take the equilateral triangle case: A = B = C = π/3.\n\nThen:\n\nRow1: sin(2π/3) = √3/2, sin(π/3) = √3/2, sin(π/3)=√3/2\n\nRow2: same as Row1\n\nRow3: same as Row1\n\nThus, Row3 = Row1, so α=1, β=0. But in this case, Row3 = Row1.\n\nFor the right-angled triangle case where A=π/2, B=C=π/4:\n\nRow1: sinπ=0, sin(π/4)=√2/2, sin(π/4)=√2/2\n\nRow2: √2/2, sin(π/2)=1, sin(π/2)=1\n\nRow3: √2/2, 1, sin(π/2)=1\n\nHere, Row3 = Row2, so α=0, β=1.\n\nBut this suggests that α and β depend on the angles, which means there isn't a universal α and β for all triangles. Therefore, this approach might not work.\n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me think differently. Maybe there's a vector identity or a known matrix property I'm missing.\n\nWait, here's another idea. If I can show that the matrix has a non-trivial kernel, i.e., there exists a non-zero vector [x, y, z] such that the matrix multiplied by [x, y, z]^T = 0. Let's assume such a vector exists. For example, in the equilateral triangle case, [1,1,1] is in the kernel. In the right-angled triangle case, [0,1,1] might be in the kernel. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in a triangle, there's a relation between the angles. Let’s use the identity A + B + C = π. Take the derivative or consider variations, but I don't see the connection.\n\nWait, going back to the original matrix:\n\nsin2A, sinC, sinB\n\nsinC, sin2B, sinA\n\nsinB, sinA, sin2C\n\nNotice that the diagonal elements are double-angle sines, and the off-diagonal are single-angle sines of the other angles. Maybe there's a pattern where each row has a relation to the angles.\n\nAnother thought: use the identity sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ and see if the matrix can be factored into a product involving diagonal matrices with sinA, sinB, sinC and another matrix involving cos terms.\n\nLet me try:\n\nLet D be a diagonal matrix with entries 2 cosA, 2 cosB, 2 cosC.\n\nLet S be a matrix with entries:\n\n[sinA, sinC, sinB]\n\n[sinC, sinB, sinA]\n\n[sinB, sinA, sinC]\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, consider that the original matrix M can be written as S * D + something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, write the original matrix as:\n\n[2 sinA cosA, sinC, sinB]\n\n[sinC, 2 sinB cosB, sinA]\n\n[sinB, sinA, 2 sinC cosC]\n\nThis can be expressed as the sum of two matrices:\n\nMatrix1: diag(2 sinA cosA, 2 sinB cosB, 2 sinC cosC)\n\nMatrix2: off-diagonal entries as the single sines.\n\nSo M = Matrix1 + Matrix2\n\nBut not sure if this decomposition helps.\n\nAnother approach: consider the determinant as a function f(A,B,C) and show that f(A,B,C) = 0 whenever A + B + C = π. Maybe use substitution C = π - A - B and expand the determinant. Although tedious, perhaps this would work.\n\nLet’s set C = π - A - B. Then sinC = sin(A + B), sin2C = sin(2π - 2A - 2B) = -sin(2A + 2B).\n\nNow, substitute into the matrix:\n\nRow1: sin2A, sin(A+B), sinB\n\nRow2: sin(A+B), sin2B, sinA\n\nRow3: sinB, sinA, -sin(2A + 2B)\n\nNow, compute the determinant:\n\nD = sin2A [sin2B*(-sin(2A+2B)) - sinA*sinA] - sin(A+B)[sin(A+B)*(-sin(2A+2B)) - sinA*sinB] + sinB [sin(A+B)*sinA - sin2B*sinB]\n\nThis is quite complicated, but let's try to simplify term by term.\n\nFirst term: sin2A [-sin2B sin(2A+2B) - sin²A]\n\nSecond term: - sin(A+B) [-sin(A+B) sin(2A+2B) - sinA sinB]\n\nThird term: sinB [sin(A+B) sinA - sin2B sinB]\n\nLet’s handle each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n- sin2A sin2B sin(2A + 2B) - sin2A sin²A\n\nSecond term:\n\n+ sin(A+B) sin(A+B) sin(2A + 2B) + sin(A+B) sinA sinB\n\nThird term:\n\n+ sinB sin(A+B) sinA - sinB sin2B sinB\n\nNow, let's use angle addition identities. Note that 2A + 2B = 2(A + B) = 2(π - C) = 2π - 2C. But since C = π - A - B, this substitution might not help. Alternatively, express sin(2A + 2B) = sin(2π - 2C) = -sin2C, but since we already substituted C = π - A - B, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, use identity sin(2A + 2B) = sin2A cos2B + cos2A sin2B. But this could lead to expansion.\n\nThis path seems too cumbersome. Maybe there's a smarter identity.\n\nWait, note that in the first term, we have sin2A sin2B sin(2A + 2B). Let’s use the identity sin P sin Q sin(P + Q) = ?\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, express sin(2A + 2B) = sin2(A + B) = 2 sin(A + B) cos(A + B). Since A + B = π - C, this becomes 2 sin(π - C) cos(π - C) = 2 sinC (-cosC) = -2 sinC cosC.\n\nSo sin(2A + 2B) = -2 sinC cosC.\n\nSimilarly, sin2A = 2 sinA cosA, sin2B = 2 sinB cosB.\n\nFirst term becomes:\n\n- (2 sinA cosA)(2 sinB cosB)(-2 sinC cosC) - (2 sinA cosA) sin²A\n\n= 8 sinA cosA sinB cosB sinC cosC - 2 sin^3 A cosA\n\nSecond term:\n\n+ (sin(A + B))^2 (-2 sinC cosC) + sin(A + B) sinA sinB\n\n= -2 sin²(A + B) sinC cosC + sin(A + B) sinA sinB\n\nBut sin(A + B) = sinC, so:\n\n= -2 sin²C sinC cosC + sinC sinA sinB\n\n= -2 sin^3 C cosC + sinA sinB sinC\n\nThird term:\n\n+ sinB sin(A + B) sinA - sinB (2 sinB cosB) sinB\n\n= sinB sinC sinA - 2 sin^3 B cosB\n\nNow, combine all terms:\n\nFirst term: 8 sinA cosA sinB cosB sinC cosC - 2 sin^3 A cosA\n\nSecond term: -2 sin^3 C cosC + sinA sinB sinC\n\nThird term: sinA sinB sinC - 2 sin^3 B cosB\n\nTotal determinant D:\n\n= 8 sinA cosA sinB cosB sinC cosC - 2 sin^3 A cosA -2 sin^3 C cosC + sinA sinB sinC + sinA sinB sinC -2 sin^3 B cosB\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 8 sinA sinB sinC cosA cosB cosC - 2 cosA sin^3 A - 2 cosB sin^3 B - 2 cosC sin^3 C + 2 sinA sinB sinC\n\nFactor terms:\n\nThe first term and last term can be grouped:\n\n= 2 sinA sinB sinC (4 cosA cosB cosC + 1)\n\n- 2 cosA sin^3 A - 2 cosB sin^3 B - 2 cosC sin^3 C\n\nBut this still doesn't obviously sum to zero. However, maybe using the identity involving cosA cosB cosC in a triangle.\n\nIn a triangle, there's an identity: cosA + cosB + cosC = 1 + r/R, where r is inradius and R is circumradius. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, in a triangle, there's an identity: cosA cosB cosC = (a² + b² + c² - 2R²)/(8R²). Again, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in any triangle, we have:\n\nsinA + sinB + sinC = 4 cos(A/2) cos(B/2) cos(C/2)\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since A + B + C = π, we can use the identity:\n\ncosA + cosB + cosC = 1 + r/R\n\nBut I don't see how to connect this to the current expression.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the expression for D, if we can show that D = 0 for all A, B, C with A + B + C = π, then we’re done. But without a clear cancellation path, it's hard to see.\n\nWait, maybe using the fact that in a triangle, we have relations like sinA = a/(2R), etc., but earlier attempt failed. Let me try again with proper substitution.\n\nLet’s denote a, b, c as the sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively. By the Law of Sines, a = 2R sinA, b = 2R sinB, c = 2R sinC. Thus, sinA = a/(2R), etc. Substitute these into the determinant expression.\n\nBut this may not help because R cancels out. Let me try:\n\nFirst term: 8 sinA sinB sinC cosA cosB cosC\n\n= 8*(a/(2R))*(b/(2R))*(c/(2R)) * cosA cosB cosC\n\n= (8abc)/(8R^3) * cosA cosB cosC\n\n= (abc)/R^3 * cosA cosB cosC\n\nOther terms:\n\n-2 cosA sin^3 A = -2 cosA*(a/(2R))^3 = -2*(a^3/(8R^3)) cosA = -a^3 cosA/(4R^3)\n\nSimilarly for the other terms.\n\nThe entire expression D becomes:\n\n(abc)/R^3 * cosA cosB cosC - [a^3 cosA + b^3 cosB + c^3 cosC]/(4R^3) + 2*(a/(2R))*(b/(2R))*(c/(2R)) \n\n= [abc cosA cosB cosC - (a^3 cosA + b^3 cosB + c^3 cosC)/4 + abc/4] / R^3\n\nFactor out 1/(4R^3):\n\n= [4abc cosA cosB cosC - a^3 cosA - b^3 cosB - c^3 cosC + abc] / (4R^3)\n\nNow, need to show that the numerator is zero for any triangle. This seems to relate to triangle identities. Perhaps using the Law of Cosines.\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines:\n\ncosA = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)\n\nSimilarly for cosB and cosC.\n\nSubstitute these into the numerator:\n\n4abc * [(b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)] * [(a² + c² - b²)/(2ac)] * [(a² + b² - c²)/(2ab)] - a³*(b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) - b³*(a² + c² - b²)/(2ac) - c³*(a² + b² - c²)/(2ab) + abc\n\nThis is extremely complicated, but let's simplify each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:\n\n4abc * [(b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)] * [(a² + c² - b²)/(2ac)] * [(a² + b² - c²)/(2ab)]\n\nSimplify each factor:\n\nFirst factor: (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)\n\nSecond factor: (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac)\n\nThird factor: (a² + b² - c²)/(2ab)\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n[(b² + c² - a²)(a² + c² - b²)(a² + b² - c²)] / (8a²b²c²)\n\nMultiply by 4abc:\n\n4abc * [ (b² + c² - a²)(a² + c² - b²)(a² + b² - c²) ] / (8a²b²c²)\n\n= [ (b² + c² - a²)(a² + c² - b²)(a² + b² - c²) ] / (2a b c)\n\nSecond term:\n\n- a³*(b² + c² - a²)/(2bc) = -a³(b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)\n\nSimilarly for the other two terms:\n\n- b³*(a² + c² - b²)/(2ac)\n\n- c³*(a² + b² - c²)/(2ab)\n\nFourth term: + abc\n\nSo the entire numerator becomes:\n\n[ (b² + c² - a²)(a² + c² - b²)(a² + b² - c²) ] / (2a b c)\n\n- [a³(b² + c² - a²) + b³(a² + c² - b²) + c³(a² + b² - c²)] / (2abc)\n\n+ abc\n\nTo combine these terms, let's get a common denominator of 2abc:\n\n= [ (b² + c² - a²)(a² + c² - b²)(a² + b² - c²) - a³(b² + c² - a²) - b³(a² + c² - b²) - c³(a² + b² - c²) + 2a²b²c² ] / (2abc)\n\nNow, need to show that the numerator is zero.\n\nThis seems like a polynomial identity in variables a, b, c. If we can show that this polynomial is identically zero for all a, b, c satisfying triangle inequalities, then we're done. However, verifying this would require expanding the terms, which is very tedious.\n\nAlternatively, consider specific values of a, b, c to test. For example, take an equilateral triangle where a = b = c. Then:\n\nNumerator terms:\n\n(b² + c² - a²) = a² + a² - a² = a²\n\nSimilarly, each term becomes a². So the first product term is (a²)^3 = a^6.\n\nThen:\n\nFirst part: a^6 / (2a^3) = a^3/2\n\nSecond part: - [a^3*(a²) + a^3*(a²) + a^3*(a²)] = -3a^5\n\nThird part: +2a^6\n\nSo numerator:\n\na^3/2 -3a^5 +2a^6\n\nBut this doesn't equal zero. Contradiction? But earlier when we tested with angles, determinant was zero. So either my substitution is wrong or this approach is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that my method is flawed, possibly due to an error in algebraic manipulation. Given the time I've spent without success, maybe I need to find another approach.\n\nLet me return to the original matrix and think differently. Maybe use row operations. Let's try to subtract Row3 from Row1 and Row2.\n\nNew Row1 = Row1 - Row3:\n\nsin2A - sinB, sinC - sinA, sinB - sin2C\n\nNew Row2 = Row2 - Row3:\n\nsinC - sinB, sin2B - sinA, sinA - sin2C\n\nNew Row3 remains: sinB, sinA, sin2C\n\nBut not sure if this helps. Alternatively, add rows.\n\nAlternatively, expand the determinant using the Rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let me try expanding along the first row.\n\nD = sin2A * [sin2B sin2C - sinA sinA] - sinC [sinC sin2C - sinA sinB] + sinB [sinC sinA - sin2B sinB]\n\nNow, simplify each part:\n\nFirst term: sin2A sin2B sin2C - sin2A sin²A\n\nSecond term: - sinC [sinC sin2C - sinA sinB] = - sin²C sin2C + sinA sinB sinC\n\nThird term: + sinB [sinC sinA - sin2B sinB] = sinA sinB sinC - sin2B sin²B\n\nCombine all terms:\n\nD = sin2A sin2B sin2C - sin2A sin²A - sin²C sin2C + sinA sinB sinC + sinA sinB sinC - sin2B sin²B\n\n= sin2A sin2B sin2C - sin2A sin²A - sin²C sin2C - sin2B sin²B + 2 sinA sinB sinC\n\nNow, factor terms:\n\n= sin2A sin2B sin2C + 2 sinA sinB sinC - [sin2A sin²A + sin2B sin²B + sin2C sin²C]\n\nHmm. Not sure. Maybe use identities for sin2θ sin²θ.\n\nLet’s compute sin2θ sin²θ = 2 sinθ cosθ sin²θ = 2 sin³θ cosθ\n\nSo each term like sin2A sin²A = 2 sin³A cosA\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n= sin2A sin2B sin2C + 2 sinA sinB sinC - 2[sin³A cosA + sin³B cosB + sin³C cosC]\n\nNow, perhaps use the identity from earlier that in a triangle, sin2A + sin2B + sin2C = 4 sinA sinB sinC. But this identity is sin2A + sin2B + sin2C = 4 sinA sinB sinC. However, we have products of sin2 terms here.\n\nAlternatively, note that if we can factor something out.\n\nWait, if A + B + C = π, then 2A + 2B + 2C = 2π. Maybe use identity involving product of sines.\n\nAlternatively, consider that sin2A sin2B sin2C can be expressed in terms of sinA sinB sinC. But I don't recall such an identity.\n\nAnother idea: Let's use the identity sin2A sin2B sin2C = 8 sinA cosA sinB cosB sinC cosC. So:\n\nD = 8 sinA cosA sinB cosB sinC cosC + 2 sinA sinB sinC - 2[sin³A cosA + sin³B cosB + sin³C cosC]\n\nFactor 2 sinA sinB sinC:\n\n= 2 sinA sinB sinC [4 cosA cosB cosC + 1] - 2 cosA sinA (sin²A + sin²B + sin²C)\n\nBut this doesn't seem helpful.\n\nWait, in a triangle, there's an identity:\n\ncosA + cosB + cosC = 1 + r/R\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, use the identity:\n\ncosA cosB cosC = (a² + b² + c² - 2R²)/(8R²)\n\nBut again, not helpful.\n\nPerhaps it's better to accept that this approach isn't working and consider another method.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem, the user mentioned they tried adding and subtracting rows/columns but failed. Maybe there's a specific row operation that works.\n\nLet me try adding all the rows:\n\nRow1 + Row2 + Row3:\n\n[sin2A + sinC + sinB, sinC + sin2B + sinA, sinB + sinA + sin2C]\n\nBut in a triangle, A + B + C = π. Let's see if there's an identity for these sums.\n\nFor example, sin2A + sinC + sinB. Let me express sin2A as 2 sinA cosA:\n\n= 2 sinA cosA + sinB + sinC\n\nSimilarly, sinC = sin(π - A - B) = sin(A + B)\n\nThus, sin2A + sinB + sinC = 2 sinA cosA + sinB + sin(A + B)\n\n= 2 sinA cosA + sinB + sinA cosB + cosA sinB\n\n= sinA (2 cosA + cosB) + sinB (1 + cosA)\n\nNot obviously zero or simplifying.\n\nAlternatively, think of specific linear combinations. For example, take Row1 - Row2:\n\n[sin2A - sinC, sinC - sin2B, sinB - sinA]\n\nSimilarly, Row2 - Row3:\n\n[sinC - sinB,",
