    "Content": "Let $A$ be a UFD, $K$ its field of fractions, and $f$ an element of $A[T]$ a monic polynomial. I'm trying to prove that if $f$ has a root $\\alpha \\in K$, then in fact $\\alpha \\in A$. I'm trying to exploit the fact of something about irreducibility, will it help? I havent done anything with splitting fields, but this is something i can look for.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof follows exactly like the proof of the Rational Root Theorem. Let $\\alpha\\in K$ be a root. We can express $\\alpha$ as $\\frac{a}{b}$ with $a,b\\in A$, and using unique factorization we may assume that no irreducible of $A$ divides both $a$ and $b$. If $f(x) = x^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+c_0$, then plugging in $\\alpha$ and multiplying through by $b^n$ we obtain\n$$a^n + c_{n-1}ba^{n-1}+\\cdots + c_0b^n = 0.$$\nNow, $c_{n-1}ba^{n-1}+\\cdots+c_0b^n$ is divisible by $b$, hence $a^n$ is divisible by $b$. Since no irreducible of $A$ divides both $a$ and $b$, it follows that $b$ must be a unit by unique factorization. Hence $\\alpha\\in A$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that if a monic polynomial in a UFD has a root in its field of fractions, then that root must actually be in the UFD itself. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions that A is a UFD, K is its field of fractions, f is an element of A[T] (so f is a polynomial with coefficients in A), and f is monic. Additionally, there's an assumption that f has a root α in K. Each of these should be a separate line in the assumptions. The problem then is to prove that α is in A. \n\nWait, the original problem also mentions trying to exploit something about irreducibility and mentions splitting fields, but the user hasn't done anything with splitting fields yet. However, in the example given, the assumptions were only the essential ones. So I should filter out the parts where the user is thinking about their approach, like \"I'm trying to exploit the fact of something about irreducibility, will it help? I haven't done anything with splitting fields...\" because those are not part of the problem's conditions. The key assumptions are the ones given in the problem statement before the user's own thoughts.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n- A is a UFD.\n- K is the field of fractions of A.\n- f is an element of A[T] (meaning f is a polynomial with coefficients in A).\n- f is monic.\n- f has a root α in K.\n\nThe problem is to prove that α ∈ A.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me check each point:\n\n1. A is a UFD. That's one condition on A.\n2. K is the field of fractions of A. That's a property relating K to A.\n3. f is an element of A[T]. So f is a polynomial over A.\n4. f is monic. That's another condition on f.\n5. f has a root α in K. That's a condition on α and f.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show α is in A. The example given in the user's instruction had the original problem mentioning divisibility by 91, and in the formatted version, they listed the assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, then the problem. So in this case, we don't need to include the user's thoughts about irreducibility or splitting fields, just the core assumptions given in the problem statement.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a UFD,\nK is the field of fractions of A,\nf is an element of A[T],\nf is monic,\nf has a root α in K.\n\nProblem:\nProve that α ∈ A.\n\nI think that's all. The key is to extract the given conditions without including the user's own thoughts or attempts. The problem is exactly as stated in the question before the user starts talking about irreducibility or splitting fields.",
