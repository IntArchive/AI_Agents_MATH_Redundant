    "Content": "I wonder about the following statement: Unit ball is compact in a real Norm Linear Space (NLS) iff the space is finite dimensional. Is this statement true? How would I go about proving this? I don't want to use that every norm in a finite dimensional real NLS is equivalent because I am using the previous result to prove the later.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The unit ball is always closed in a normed (real or complex) linear space.  You may be thinking of compactness: The unit ball is compact iff the space is finite dimensional. For the first direction, prove the contrapositive by fixing $\\epsilon > 0$ and then choosing a countable set of linearly independent vectors with length less than $1$, so that each subsequent vector is further than $\\epsilon$ from the span of the previous vectors. This can be done with Riesz's lemma . This is a sequence with no convergent subsequence. For the converse direction, pick a basis and consider $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Thank you for the correction, Martin.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's instructions. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the problem, filter out unrelated info, and structure it into Assumptions and Problem sections. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, each applying to one object or property.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, they only kept \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. The problem statement then restates the main task.\n\nNow, the current problem is about whether the unit ball in a normed linear space is compact if and only if the space is finite-dimensional. The user wants to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original question mentions a real Normed Linear Space (NLS). So the first assumption is that the space is a real NLS. The problem is about the unit ball being compact iff the space is finite-dimensional. The user also mentions not wanting to use the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions because they want to use the unit ball result to prove that equivalence. So maybe that's an implicit assumption here, but the problem as stated doesn't have additional explicit assumptions beyond the space being a real NLS. \n\nWait, the problem statement is the equivalence: unit ball compact ⇨ finite-dimensional and vice versa. The assumptions would be the conditions given. But the original question doesn't list any specific conditions except that the space is a real NLS. So the main assumption here is that we're working in a real normed linear space. The problem is to prove the equivalence between the compactness of the unit ball and the space being finite-dimensional.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, there's no such condition except the space being a real NLS. So maybe the assumption here is just that the space is a real normed linear space. However, the problem is about two directions: if the unit ball is compact, then the space is finite-dimensional, and conversely, if the space is finite-dimensional, then the unit ball is compact. But the user might not want to use the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions. So perhaps the assumption is that the space is a real NLS, and we have to prove both directions without using that all norms are equivalent in finite dimensions. Wait, the user says, \"I don't want to use that every norm in a finite dimensional real NLS is equivalent because I am using the previous result to prove the later.\" So the assumption here is that we cannot use the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions. But how to structure that as an assumption? Maybe the user is assuming that the equivalence of norms is not to be used in the proof. However, in the problem structure, assumptions are about the problem's conditions, not about the methods used in the proof. So perhaps that's not part of the problem's assumptions but rather a constraint on the proof method. The user wants to structure the problem, not the solution method. Therefore, the only assumption is that the space is a real normed linear space. The problem is to show that the unit ball is compact iff the space is finite-dimensional. But in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on the variables. Here, perhaps the assumption is just the space being a real NLS. However, the problem is about an equivalence, so maybe the two directions are separate. But the user wants the problem statement to be as per the original, which is the equivalence. So the formatted problem would have the assumption that the space is a real NLS, and the problem is to prove the equivalence. Wait, but in the example, the assumption listed specific conditions on n, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but then they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean that n is an integer is part of the problem's premise. But in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which makes sense. But the original problem didn't have \"n is divisible by 7\" as a condition. Wait, that example might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that contradicts because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is \"n is divisible by 7\" an assumption? That seems like an error. Maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a different assumption. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n that A(n) is divisible by 91, then the assumptions should be that n is an integer. The problem would be to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which would restrict the problem to n divisible by 7, which is not what the original problem stated. That seems incorrect. So perhaps the example is not a good one, but the user provided it. So maybe in this case, the user's example has an error, but we have to follow their format regardless.\n\nBut for the current problem, the original question states: \"Is it true that the unit ball is compact in a real Norm Linear Space (NLS) iff the space is finite-dimensional?\" The user wants to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. So the assumptions would be the conditions given. The problem is to prove the equivalence. But the original problem doesn't have specific conditions beyond the space being a real NLS. Therefore, the assumption here is that the space is a real NLS. The problem is to prove that the unit ball is compact if and only if the space is finite-dimensional. Additionally, the user mentions not wanting to use the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions, but that's a constraint on the proof method, not an assumption of the problem itself. So perhaps in the assumptions, we only list that the space is a real NLS. However, the problem is about both directions: compact unit ball implies finite-dimensional and vice versa. But the problem statement as given is to prove the equivalence, so the formatted problem would be as such. So:\n\nAssumption: The space is a real normed linear space.\n\nProblem: Prove that the unit ball is compact if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.\n\nBut wait, in the example, each assumption is a separate line. So here, \"The space is a real normed linear space\" can be split into two assumptions if necessary. For example, \"The space is a normed linear space,\" and \"The space is over the real numbers.\" But the original problem states \"real Norm Linear Space (NLS)\", so maybe two separate assumptions: \"The space is a normed linear space,\" and \"The space is real (over the real field).\"\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property applied to one object. So splitting into two lines: \"The space is a normed linear space,\" and \"The scalar field is the real numbers.\" That way, each is a separate assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is a normed linear space,\nThe scalar field is the real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the unit ball is compact if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.\n\nThat seems correct. The original question doesn't mention any other conditions, so those are the only assumptions. The problem is the equivalence statement. The user's additional note about not wanting to use equivalence of norms is part of the solution approach, not the problem's assumptions, so it's omitted in the formatted problem.",
