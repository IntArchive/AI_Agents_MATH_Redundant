    "Content": "I am preparing to take my first course in complex variables. I am reading some lecture notes online.  They claim that the function $f(z) = Re(z)$ is continuous but NOT differentiable.  I know the definitions of a limit, of continuity, and of a derivative.  I understand why this function is continuous.  I am trying to show that it is NOT differentiable.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The definition of derivative can be written as $$ f'(z) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{f(z+h) - f(z)}{h} $$ which looks just like the real-variable definition, \nbut here this is taken in the complex sense, i.e. $h$ is allowed to be a complex number. $h \\to 0$ means the distance in the complex plane from $h$ to $0$ goes to $0$ (or equivalently, both real and imaginary parts of $h$ go to $0$).  In order for the limit to exist, you must always get the same value as $h \\to 0$ in any manner. If you take $h$ to be real, $f(z+h) = f(z) + h$ and the quotient is $1$. If you take $h$ to be imaginary, $f(z+h) = f(z)$ and the quotient is $0$. The limit as $h \\to 0$ doesn't exist: it can't be both $1$ and $0$.  Thus we say $f'(z)$ doesn't exist, and the function is not differentiable.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. The original question here is about whether the complex function f(z) = Re(z) is differentiable. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that f(z) is the real part of z, which is Re(z). So the first assumption is that f is defined as Re(z). The user also mentions that f is continuous but not differentiable, but the task is to show it's not differentiable. The original problem doesn't explicitly state any additional conditions, but in complex analysis, differentiability is considered in the complex plane. So another assumption might be that z is a complex variable. Also, differentiability here refers to complex differentiability, not real differentiability. So those are key points.\n\nSo breaking it down, the assumptions are:\n1. f(z) = Re(z)\n2. z is a complex variable\n3. Differentiability is in the complex sense.\n\nThe problem is to show that f(z) is not differentiable. \n\nWait, the example had specific conditions applied to one object each. Here, the function f is defined as Re(z), which is one property. Then, z being a complex variable is another condition. Differentiability in the complex sense is another condition. Each of these applies to different objects: f's definition, the domain of z, and the type of differentiability. So I need to list each of these as separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f(z) = Re(z),\n- z is a complex variable,\n- differentiability is considered in the complex sense.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(z) = Re(z) is not differentiable.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions that the function is continuous but NOT differentiable. However, the assumptions in the example didn't include the continuity part because it's not directly an assumption but a given property. The user is to structure the problem by listing assumptions, then the problem. Here, the continuity is established, but the differentiability is the question. So maybe the continuity isn't an assumption here but part of the problem's context. However, the example given by the user included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which was part of the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no. Wait the original example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer. But the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the example is from a different problem. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nThe example's original problem states: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nThe formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is \"n is divisible by 7\" an assumption? That seems contradictory. Unless maybe the example is incorrect. Hmm. Wait, maybe the example is from a different version of the problem where perhaps the user made a mistake. But regardless, following the user's instruction, they want to structure the problem by listing assumptions from the original problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is: Is the complex function f(z) = Re(z) differentiable? The user wants to structure this into assumptions and problem. The key points are:\n\n- f(z) is defined as Re(z).\n- The context is complex analysis, so z is a complex variable.\n- Differentiability is in the complex sense.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are those three points. The problem is to prove that f is not differentiable.",
