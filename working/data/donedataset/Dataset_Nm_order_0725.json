    "Content": "How to solve the following problem from Hall and Knight's Higher Algebra ? Suppose that \\begin{align}\na&=zb+yc,\\tag{1}\\\\\nb&=xc+za,\\tag{2}\\\\\nc&=ya+xb.\\tag{3}\n\\end{align} Prove that $$\\frac{a^2}{1-x^2}=\\frac{b^2}{1-y^2}=\\frac{c^2}{1-z^2}.\\tag{4}$$ (I suppose that $x,y,z$ are real numbers whose moduli are not equal to $1$ .) I discovered this problem from chapter 3 of Prelude to Mathematics by W. W. Sawyer. Sawyer thought that this problem arose from the sine law: let $a,b,c$ be respectively the lengths of the edges opposite to three vertices $A,B,C$ of a triangle. Define $x=\\cos A$ and define $y,z$ analogously. Now equalities $(1)-(3)$ simply relate $a,b$ and $c$ to each other by the cosines of the angles and $(4)$ is just a rewrite of the sine law $$\n\\frac{a}{\\sin A}=\\frac{b}{\\sin B}=\\frac{c}{\\sin C}.\n$$ However, the algebraic version $(4)$ looks more general. For example, it does not state that $a,b,c$ must be positive or that they must satisfy the triangle inequality. Sawyer wrote that this isn't a hard problem, but he didn't provide any solution. I can prove $(4)$ using linear algebra. Suppose that $(a,b,c)\\ne(0,0,0)$ (otherwise $(4)$ is obvious). Rewrite $(1)-(3)$ in the form of $M\\mathbf a=0$ : $$\\begin{bmatrix}-1&z&y\\\\ z&-1&x\\\\ y&x&-1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}a\\\\ b\\\\ c\\end{bmatrix}=0.$$ Since $x^2,y^2,z^2\\ne1$ , $M$ has rank $2$ and $D=\\operatorname{adj}(M)$ has rank $1$ . Hence all columns of $D$ are parallel to $(a,b,c)^T$ and $\\frac{d_{11}}{d_{21}}=\\frac{d_{12}}{d_{22}}=\\frac{a}{b}$ . Since $M$ is symmetric, $D$ is symmetric too. Therefore $\\frac{1-x^2}{1-y^2}=\\frac{d_{11}}{d_{22}}=\\frac{d_{11}d_{12}}{d_{21}d_{22}}=\\frac{a^2}{b^2}$ , i.e. $\\frac{a^2}{1-x^2}=\\frac{b^2}{1-y^2}$ . As this problem comes from Hall and Knight's book, I think there should be a more elementary solution. Any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a=0$ . Thus, $$xc=b$$ and $$xb=c,$$ which gives $$x^2bc=bc$$ or $$(x^2-1)bc=0$$ and since $x^2\\neq1,$ we obtain $bc=0$ and from here $$a=b=c=0,$$ which gives that our statement is true. Let $abc\\neq0$ . Thus, $$\\frac{zb}{a}+\\frac{yc}{a}=1$$ and $$\\frac{xc}{b}+\\frac{za}{b}=1,$$ which gives $$z^2+\\frac{xyc^2}{ab}+\\frac{xzc}{a}+\\frac{yzc}{b}=1$$ or $$\\frac{1-z^2}{c^2}=\\frac{xy}{ab}+\\frac{yz}{bc}+\\frac{zx}{ca},$$ which gives $$\\frac{a^2}{1-x^2}=\\frac{b^2}{1-y^2}=\\frac{c^2}{1-z^2}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{xy}{ab}+\\frac{yz}{bc}+\\frac{zx}{ca}}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original problem carefully and filter out any unrelated information to extract the core assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that given the system of equations:\n\na = zb + yc  \nb = xc + za  \nc = ya + xb  \n\nwe need to show that a²/(1 - x²) = b²/(1 - y²) = c²/(1 - z²).\n\nThe user mentioned that x, y, z are real numbers with moduli not equal to 1. Also, they provided some context about the problem relating to the sine law in triangles, but that's background information and not part of the problem's assumptions. The key here is to list each assumption line by line, making sure each addresses one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst assumption: The variables a, b, c satisfy the three given equations. However, each equation involves different variables, so maybe each equation should be a separate assumption? Wait, the problem states that a, b, c are defined by equations (1), (2), (3). So each equation is a separate condition. Therefore, each equation should be listed as an assumption.\n\nNext, the problem mentions that x, y, z are real numbers with moduli not equal to 1. That's another important assumption because if |x|, |y|, or |z| were 1, the denominators in the conclusion would be zero, making the expressions undefined. So this needs to be included as well. But since moduli (absolute values) not equal to 1 applies to each of x, y, z individually, should each be a separate assumption? The original example listed each condition per line for each object. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate lines. However, here, the moduli condition applies to x, y, z. So maybe three separate assumptions: |x| ≠ 1, |y| ≠ 1, |z| ≠ 1. Alternatively, since the user wrote \"x,y,z are real numbers whose moduli are not equal to 1,\" perhaps that's a single assumption covering all three. But according to the format, each assumption should address one property for one object. So perhaps split them into three separate lines.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that (a, b, c) ≠ (0, 0, 0), which they considered in their linear algebra approach. However, the problem as stated in Hall and Knight's book may not explicitly state this, but if a, b, c are all zero, the conclusion is trivial. So maybe the non-trivial solution is an assumption. But the original problem says \"Prove that...\" without specifying, so perhaps the assumption is that a, b, c are not all zero. However, the original user said \"(otherwise (4) is obvious)\" implying that if a,b,c are zero, the equalities hold trivially. Therefore, maybe the assumption is that a, b, c are not all zero. But the problem as posed might not state that. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe original problem says: \"Suppose that [equations (1)-(3)]. Prove that (4). (I suppose that x,y,z are real numbers whose moduli are not equal to 1.)\" So the user added the parenthetical about x,y,z moduli. The problem from the book might not specify that, but the user is assuming that. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. Equations (1), (2), (3) hold for a, b, c.\n2. x, y, z are real numbers.\n3. |x| ≠ 1, |y| ≠ 1, |z| ≠ 1.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the non-trivial solution (a, b, c) ≠ (0, 0, 0) is an assumption, but the problem states \"Suppose that [equations]\" which could allow for trivial solutions. However, if all a, b, c are zero, then the conclusion would have 0/denominator, which is 0, so all equal. But the user's parenthetical says \"otherwise (4) is obvious,\" so maybe the non-trivial case is considered. However, since the problem says \"Prove that...\" without excluding the trivial case, perhaps we don't need to assume (a,b,c) ≠ (0,0,0). The equations (1)-(3) could allow for non-trivial solutions only if the determinant of the matrix M is zero, which the user mentioned, but that's part of the solution approach, not the problem's assumption.\n\nSo, compiling the assumptions:\n\n- Equation (1): a = zb + yc\n- Equation (2): b = xc + za\n- Equation (3): c = ya + xb\n- x is a real number with |x| ≠ 1\n- y is a real number with |y| ≠ 1\n- z is a real number with |z| ≠ 1\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumption section. The problem statement is to prove the equality of the three fractions.\n\nNow, checking the example given, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each is a separate line. So here, each equation and each condition on x, y, z should be separate.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as above, and the problem statement as proving the equality of the fractions.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"Suppose that \\begin{align} a&=zb+yc,\\tag{1}\\\\ b&=xc+za,\\tag{2}\\\\ c&=ya+xb.\\tag{3} \\end{align} Prove that...\" and then added the parenthetical about x,y,z. So the key assumptions are the three equations and the conditions on x,y,z. Therefore, each equation is an assumption, and each condition on x, y, z is separate.\n\nThus, the structured problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na = zb + yc,\nb = xc + za,\nc = ya + xb,\nx is a real number with |x| ≠ 1,\ny is a real number with |y| ≠ 1,\nz is a real number with |z| ≠ 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that (a²)/(1 - x²) = (b²)/(1 - y²) = (c²)/(1 - z²).\n\nYes, that seems accurate. Each equation and each variable's condition is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove the equality of the three ratios.",
