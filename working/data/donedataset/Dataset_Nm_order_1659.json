    "AcceptedAnswer": "1. Preliminary We introduce some facts and observations to be used throughout the computation. This may as well help those who are already familiar with such computations and want to skip the details. 1.1. Dirichlet kernel. By a simple application of the geometric sum formula, we have $$ \\sum_{k=-n}^{n} e^{\\mathrm{i}kx} = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{2n+1}{2}x\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)}. \\tag{1.1} $$ 1.2. Beta function identity. For $\\operatorname{Re}(z) > 0$ and $\\operatorname{Re}(w) > 0$ we have $$ \\int_{0}^{1} x^{z-1}(1-x)^{w-1} \\, dx = \\frac{\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(w)}{\\Gamma(z+w)}, \\tag{1.2} $$ where $\\Gamma$ is the gamma function . 1.3. An integral identity. For $|\\Re(s)| < \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $$ \\sec(\\pi s)\n= \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{2s}}{1+u^2} \\, du\n= \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u^{2s} + u^{-2s}}{1+u^2} \\, du. \\tag{1.3}$$ This can be obtained directly by adopting some contour integration technique. Alternatively, this can be derived by plugging the substitution $x = \\frac{1}{1+u^2}$ to $\\text{(1.2)}$ with $z = s = 1-w$ and applying the Euler's reflection formula . 2. Solution 2.1. Derivation of the key formula. Notice that we can write $g(n) = S_n^2$, where $S_n$ is given by $$S_n = 4^n\\left( 1 + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(-1)^j \\cos^{2n}\\left(\\frac{j\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)\\right).$$ We perform some algebraic manipulation on $S_n$ by utilizing the identity $2\\cos x = e^{\\mathrm{i}x} + e^{-\\mathrm{i}x}$ and the binomial theorem. \\begin{align*}\nS_n\n&= 4^n \\sum_{j=-n}^{n} (-1)^j \\cos^{2n}\\left(\\frac{j\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=-n}^{n} (-1)^j \\left( 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{j\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) \\right)^{2n}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=-n}^{n} (-1)^j \\sum_{l=0}^{2n}\\binom{2n}{l} \\exp\\left(\\mathrm{i}\\frac{(2l-2n)j\\pi}{2n+1} \\right).\n\\end{align*} Interchanging the summations and applying $\\text{(1.1)}$ and $\\text{(1.3)}$ successively, this simplifies to \\begin{align*}\nS_n\n&\\stackrel{\\text{(1.1)}}{=} \\sum_{l=0}^{2n}\\binom{2n}{l} (-1)^{l} \\sec\\left(\\frac{(l-n)\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) \\\\\n&\\stackrel{\\text{(1.3)}}{=} \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sum_{l=0}^{2n}\\binom{2n}{l} (-1)^{l} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u^{2(l-n)/(2n+1)} + u^{-2(l-n)/(2n+1)}}{1+u^2} \\, du.\n\\end{align*} Applying the binomial theorem and plugging the substitution $u = v^{2n+1}$, we obtain the following integral representation which is a key step to our goal. \\begin{align*}\nS_n\n= \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\left(1-u^{2/(2n+1)} \\right)^{2n}}{u^{2n/(2n+1)} (1+u^2)} \\, du\n= \\bbox[border:2px dashed green,6px]{ \\frac{4(2n+1)}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\left(1-v^2 \\right)^{2n}}{1+v^{4n+2}} \\, dv }. \\tag{2.1}\n\\end{align*} 2.2. Evaluation of the limit. We estimate our integral representation $\\text{(2.1)}$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\left(1-v^2 \\right)^{2n}}{1+v^{4n+2}}\\, dv\n&= \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(1-v^2 \\right)^{2n}\\, dv - \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\left(1-v^2 \\right)^{2n}v^{4n+2}}{1+v^{4n+2}}\\, dv \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\\frac{\\Gamma(2n+1)}{\\Gamma(2n+\\frac{3}{2})} +\\mathcal{O}(16^{-n}).\n\\end{align*} Here, the first integral is computed using the beta function identity $\\text{(1.2)}$ and the second integral is estimated using the fact that $0 \\leq v^2(1-v^2) \\leq \\frac{1}{4}$ for all $v \\in [0,1]$. So it follows that $$ S_n = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\frac{\\Gamma(2n+2)}{\\Gamma(2n+\\frac{3}{2})} + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n}{16^n}\\right). $$ By the Stirling's approximation, we easily check that $\\Gamma(2n+2)/\\Gamma(2n+\\frac{3}{2}) \\sim \\sqrt{2n}$ as $n\\to\\infty$. Here, the relation $\\sim$ means that the ratio of two quantities goes to $1$. From this, we obtain $$ g(n) = \\bbox[border:2px dashed green,6px]{ \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\Gamma(2n+2)}{\\Gamma(2n+\\frac{3}{2})} \\right)^2 + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n^{3/2}}{16^n}\\right) }. \\tag{2.2}$$ This already tells that $g(n) \\sim \\frac{8}{\\pi}n$ as $n\\to\\infty$, so we can expect that $g(n+1) - g(n) = \\frac{8}{\\pi}$ if it converges. This is indeed true, as we have $$ g(n+1) - g(n)\n= \\frac{4}{\\pi}\n\\underbrace{ \\left( \\left( \\frac{4n+6}{4n+5}\\cdot\\frac{4n+4}{4n+3} \\right)^2 - 1 \\right) }_{\\sim \\frac{1}{n}}\n\\cdot \n\\underbrace{ \\left( \\frac{\\Gamma(2n+2)}{\\Gamma(2n+\\frac{3}{2})} \\right)^2 }_{\\sim 2n} + o(1) $$ The upshot of this calculation is what we have expected: $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( g(n+1)-g(n) \\right) = \\frac{8}{\\pi}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to prove that the limit of g(n+1) - g(n) as n approaches infinity exists. The function g(n) is given by 16^n multiplied by the square of (1 + 2 times the sum from j=1 to n of (-1)^j times cosine raised to the power of 2n of (jπ/(2n+1)). Hmm, that looks complicated. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's parse the function g(n). It's 16^n times [1 + 2 sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1))] squared. The limit we're interested in is the difference between g(n+1) and g(n) as n becomes very large. So, we need to analyze the behavior of this difference as n grows without bound.\n\nThe key here might be to understand the sum inside the brackets. Let's denote S(n) = sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)). So, g(n) = 16^n [1 + 2 S(n)]^2. Then, the difference g(n+1) - g(n) would be 16^{n+1}[1 + 2 S(n+1)]^2 - 16^n [1 + 2 S(n)]^2. Factoring out 16^n, we get 16^n [16 [1 + 2 S(n+1)]^2 - [1 + 2 S(n)]^2]. To find the limit of this as n approaches infinity, we need to analyze the behavior of S(n) and S(n+1) for large n.\n\nLooking at the cosine term: cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)). For large n, 2n+1 is approximately 2n, so jπ/(2n+1) ≈ jπ/(2n). The argument of the cosine is small when j is small compared to n. For fixed j as n becomes large, jπ/(2n) tends to zero, so cos(jπ/(2n)) ≈ 1 - (jπ/(2n))^2 / 2. But since it's raised to the power of 2n, we might approximate this using the exponential function. Recall that (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a} as n tends to infinity. So, cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n)) ≈ [1 - (jπ)^2/(8n^2)]^{2n} ≈ e^{- (jπ)^2/(4n)}. Wait, but here the exponent is 2n times something of order 1/n^2, so it would decay like e^{- C/n}, which tends to 1 as n becomes large? Hmm, maybe I need a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the substitution k = j. If j is fixed and n tends to infinity, then the angle jπ/(2n+1) is small. So cos(jπ/(2n+1)) ≈ 1 - (jπ)^2/(2*(2n+1)^2). Then, cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)) ≈ [1 - (jπ)^2/(2*(2n+1)^2)]^{2n} ≈ exp(- (jπ)^2 * 2n / (2*(2n+1)^2)) ≈ exp(- (jπ)^2 / (4n)). So as n becomes large, this term tends to 1 for each fixed j? Wait, but if we take n to infinity, then for fixed j, this term tends to 1, but multiplied by (-1)^j, so the sum S(n) would be approximately sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j * 1. But that sum would alternate between -1 and 0 depending on n. However, when j is of order n, say j = tn for some t between 0 and 1, then the angle is tπ/2, so cos(tπ/2) which is cos of some finite angle. Then, cos^{2n}(tπ/2) would decay exponentially if |cos(tπ/2)| < 1. For t in (0,1), cos(tπ/2) is between 0 and 1, so raising it to the 2n power would make it go to zero. So, perhaps the main contributions to the sum S(n) come from small j, where the cosine term is close to 1, but with alternating signs.\n\nWait, but even for small j, if n is large, the term (-1)^j cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)) would be (-1)^j times something approaching 1. So, the sum S(n) would be roughly sum_{j=1}^\\infty (-1)^j, which is divergent. But since the sum is up to n, and each term is (-1)^j, the partial sum would oscillate. However, we have the factor cos^{2n}(...) which actually might dampen the terms for larger j. Maybe for larger j, even though j is up to n, the cosine term becomes small enough that those terms are negligible. Let's check.\n\nSuppose j is of order n, say j = xn where x is between 0 and 1. Then the angle is xnπ/(2n+1) ≈ xπ/2. So cos(xπ/2) is between 0 and 1. Then cos^{2n}(xπ/2) = [cos(xπ/2)]^{2n}. If x is in (0,1), then cos(xπ/2) is less than 1, so raised to the power 2n, it would decay exponentially. So the terms where j is a significant fraction of n would contribute negligibly. Therefore, the main contributions to the sum S(n) would come from j much smaller than n, say j fixed as n grows. For those j, we can approximate cos(jπ/(2n+1)) ≈ 1 - (jπ)^2/(2*(2n+1)^2), and then cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)) ≈ e^{- (jπ)^2/(4n)}. Therefore, for each fixed j, as n approaches infinity, this term tends to 1. So, the term (-1)^j * 1 would contribute, but multiplied by 2 in the expression 1 + 2 S(n). Wait, but 1 + 2 sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j. Let's compute the sum sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j. That's an alternating series. For example, if n is even, sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j = 0. If n is odd, sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j = -1. But in our case, the sum is multiplied by 2 and added to 1. So if n is even, 1 + 2*0 = 1. If n is odd, 1 + 2*(-1) = -1. But this seems problematic because the expression [1 + 2 S(n)]^2 would then be either 1 or 1, since squaring removes the sign. Wait, but in reality, the sum S(n) isn't exactly sum (-1)^j because each term is multiplied by cos^{2n}(...). So, even though for fixed j, the cosine term approaches 1, for each finite n, the cosine term is less than 1, so the sum S(n) is not exactly the same as the alternating sum. Therefore, perhaps the expression 1 + 2 S(n) converges to something as n tends to infinity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire expression [1 + 2 S(n)] approaches a limit as n tends to infinity. Let's call that limit L. Then, g(n) = 16^n L^2, so g(n+1) - g(n) = 16^{n+1} L^2 - 16^n L^2 = 16^n (16 L^2 - L^2) = 15 * 16^n L^2. But that would tend to infinity unless L=0, which seems unlikely. So perhaps the initial assumption that [1 + 2 S(n)] approaches a constant is wrong. Alternatively, maybe [1 + 2 S(n)] behaves like C / 4^n, so that when squared and multiplied by 16^n, it becomes C^2. Then, g(n) would be 16^n * (C / 4^n)^2 = C^2, a constant. Then, g(n+1) - g(n) would be C^2 - C^2 = 0. But the problem states to prove the existence of the limit, not necessarily that it's zero. Hmm, but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps [1 + 2 S(n)] behaves like K / 4^n, so that when squared, it becomes K^2 / 16^n, and then multiplied by 16^n gives K^2, so g(n) approaches K^2. Then, the difference g(n+1) - g(n) would approach K^2 - K^2 = 0. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nTo get a better handle, maybe we need to evaluate the sum S(n). Let's try small n and see.\n\nFor n=1: S(1) = sum_{j=1}^1 (-1)^1 cos^{2}(π/3). cos(π/3) = 0.5, so cos^2(π/3) = 0.25. So S(1) = -1 * 0.25 = -0.25. Then 1 + 2 S(1) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. Then g(1) = 16^1 * (0.5)^2 = 16 * 0.25 = 4.\n\nFor n=2: S(2) = (-1)^1 cos^4(π/5) + (-1)^2 cos^4(2π/5). Let's compute cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090, cos^4 ≈ 0.8090^4 ≈ 0.4305. Similarly, cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090, cos^4 ≈ 0.3090^4 ≈ 0.0093. So S(2) ≈ -0.4305 + 0.0093 ≈ -0.4212. Then 1 + 2 S(2) ≈ 1 - 0.8424 ≈ 0.1576. Then g(2) = 16^2 * (0.1576)^2 ≈ 256 * 0.0248 ≈ 6.35.\n\nFor n=3: sum_{j=1}^3 (-1)^j cos^{6}(jπ/7). Compute each term:\n\nj=1: cos(π/7) ≈ 0.90097, raised to 6 ≈ 0.9^6 ≈ 0.5314; times (-1)^1 = -0.5314\n\nj=2: cos(2π/7) ≈ 0.6235, raised to 6 ≈ 0.6235^6 ≈ 0.0585; times (-1)^2 = +0.0585\n\nj=3: cos(3π/7) ≈ 0.2225, raised to 6 ≈ 0.2225^6 ≈ 0.00015; times (-1)^3 = -0.00015\n\nSo S(3) ≈ -0.5314 + 0.0585 - 0.00015 ≈ -0.473. Then 1 + 2 S(3) ≈ 1 - 0.946 ≈ 0.054. Then g(3) = 16^3 * (0.054)^2 ≈ 4096 * 0.0029 ≈ 11.9.\n\nHmm, so g(1)=4, g(2)≈6.35, g(3)≈11.9. The differences are g(2)-g(1)≈2.35, g(3)-g(2)≈5.55. Not sure if there's a pattern here. Maybe as n increases, g(n) increases and the differences might approach a limit. But from n=1 to 2, difference ~2.35; n=2 to 3, ~5.55; perhaps it's not stabilizing yet. Let's try n=4.\n\nFor n=4: j=1 to 4.\n\nj=1: cos(π/9) ≈ 0.9397, cos^8 ≈ 0.9397^8 ≈ 0.645; times (-1)^1 = -0.645\n\nj=2: cos(2π/9) ≈ 0.7660, cos^8 ≈ 0.7660^8 ≈ 0.111; times (-1)^2 = +0.111\n\nj=3: cos(3π/9)=cos(π/3)=0.5, cos^8=0.0039; times (-1)^3 = -0.0039\n\nj=4: cos(4π/9)≈0.1736, cos^8≈≈0.000002; times (-1)^4=+0.000002\n\nSo S(4) ≈ -0.645 + 0.111 -0.0039 +0.000002 ≈ -0.5379. Then 1 + 2 S(4) ≈ 1 - 1.0758 ≈ -0.0758. Then g(4)=16^4*(-0.0758)^2 ≈ 65536 * 0.00575 ≈ 377. So the difference g(4) - g(3) ≈ 377 - 11.9 ≈ 365.1. That's a huge jump. Wait, that can't be right. Did I compute S(4) correctly? Wait, j=1: angle is π/(2*4 +1)=π/9≈0.349 radians, cos≈0.9397. So cos^8≈0.9397^8≈0.645? Let me check 0.9397^2≈0.883, squared again 0.883^2≈0.780, squared again 0.780^2≈0.608. So 0.9397^8≈0.608. So j=1 term is -0.608.\n\nj=2: 2π/9≈0.698 radians, cos≈0.7660. 0.7660^8: 0.7660^2≈0.586, squared≈0.343, squared≈0.117. So ≈0.117, so +0.117.\n\nj=3: 3π/9=π/3≈1.047 radians, cos=0.5. 0.5^8=0.0039, so -0.0039.\n\nj=4: 4π/9≈1.396 radians, cos≈0.1736. 0.1736^8≈≈(0.1736^2)^4≈0.0301^4≈≈8.2e-6. So +0.0000082.\n\nSo total S(4)≈-0.608 +0.117 -0.0039 +0.000008≈-0.4949. Then 1 + 2*(-0.4949)=1 -0.9898≈0.0102. Then g(4)=16^4*(0.0102)^2≈65536*0.000104≈6.82. Then difference g(4)-g(3)=6.82 -11.9≈-5.08. Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor n=4, S(4) ≈-0.608 +0.117 -0.0039 +0.000008≈-0.4949. Then 1 + 2 S(n)=1 - 0.9898≈0.0102. Then g(4)=16^4*(0.0102)^2=65536*(0.000104)=≈6.82. So the difference g(4)-g(3)=6.82 -11.9≈-5.08. That's a negative difference. Hmm, this suggests that g(n) is oscillating. But that seems odd. Maybe my approximations for the cosine terms are too rough. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where even n and odd n behave differently. Let's check n=5.\n\nFor n=5, j=1 to 5.\n\nj=1: angle π/(11)≈0.2856, cos≈0.959, cos^{10}≈0.959^10≈≈0.959^2=0.919, ^2=0.845, ^2=0.713, *0.959^2≈0.713*0.919≈0.655. So≈0.655; (-1)^1=-0.655\n\nj=2: 2π/11≈0.5712, cos≈0.841, cos^{10}≈0.841^10≈0.841^2=0.707, ^2=0.500, ^2=0.250, *0.841^2≈0.250*0.707≈0.177. So≈0.177; (-1)^2=+0.177\n\nj=3: 3π/11≈0.8568, cos≈0.654, cos^{10}≈0.654^10≈≈0.654^2=0.428, ^2=0.183, ^2=0.0335, *0.654^2≈0.0335*0.428≈0.0143; (-1)^3=-0.0143\n\nj=4:4π/11≈1.142, cos≈0.415, cos^{10}≈0.415^10≈≈0.415^2=0.172, ^2=0.0296, ^2=0.000876, *0.415^2≈0.000876*0.172≈0.000150; (-1)^4=+0.00015\n\nj=5:5π/11≈1.427, cos≈0.142, cos^{10}≈0.142^10≈≈7.3e-6; (-1)^5=-7.3e-6\n\nSo S(5)≈-0.655 +0.177 -0.0143 +0.00015 -0.0000073≈-0.492. Then 1 + 2 S(5)=1 -0.984≈0.016. Then g(5)=16^5*(0.016)^2=1048576*0.000256≈268.435. Then difference g(5)-g(4)=268.435 -6.82≈261.615. That's a huge jump again. This suggests that my manual calculations are unreliable because of approximation errors. Maybe the actual behavior is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression [1 + 2 S(n)] is decaying as n increases, but when squared and multiplied by 16^n, it's leading to growth or oscillation. However, the problem states that the limit of g(n+1) - g(n) exists. So perhaps despite the apparent oscillations, the difference converges.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the expression inside the square brackets approaches zero rapidly enough such that 16^n times that squared approaches a finite limit. If so, then the difference g(n+1) - g(n) would approach that limit minus the previous term. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find an asymptotic expansion for S(n) as n tends to infinity. Let's consider the sum S(n) = sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)). Let's change variables. Let x_j = j/(2n+1). Then, the angle becomes jπ/(2n+1) = π x_j. As n becomes large, x_j ranges from approximately 0 to 1/(2n+1) *n ≈ 1/2. Wait, but j goes up to n, so x_j goes up to n/(2n+1) ≈ 1/2. So the angle ranges from 0 to approximately π/2. So cos^{2n}(π x_j). Let's write x_j = j/(2n+1). Let's set k = j, and consider k as a variable. Then, as n→infty, for fixed k, x_j ≈ k/(2n), so π x_j ≈ π k/(2n). Then, cos^{2n}(π k/(2n)) ≈ [1 - (π k)^2/(8n^2)]^{2n} ≈ e^{- (π k)^2/(4n)}. Therefore, for fixed k, the term approaches e^{- (π k)^2/(4n)}. But then, summing over k from 1 to n, with (-1)^k. Wait, but if k is fixed and n→infty, the exponent becomes negligible, so e^{-0}=1. So each term is (-1)^k *1, and sum is the same as sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^k which diverges. But this can't be, so maybe the approximation isn't valid here.\n\nAlternatively, consider k scaling with sqrt(n). Let’s set k = t sqrt(n). Then, π k/(2n) = π t/(2 sqrt(n)). Then, cos^{2n}(π t/(2 sqrt(n))) ≈ [1 - (π^2 t^2)/(8n)]^{2n} ≈ e^{- (π^2 t^2)/4}. So the term becomes (-1)^{t sqrt(n)} e^{- (π^2 t^2)/4}. But (-1)^{t sqrt(n)} oscillates rapidly unless t sqrt(n) is integer, which complicates things. Maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the integral test. Approximate the sum S(n) as an integral. For large n, the sum over j from 1 to n of (-1)^j cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)) can be approximated by an integral from x=0 to x=1/2 of (-1)^{x(2n)} cos^{2n}(π x) * (2n dx). Wait, but the (-1)^j term alternates signs. If we can model this as (-1)^{x(2n)}, but x(2n) would be j, but j is an integer. This seems tricky. Alternatively, separate the sum into even and odd terms.\n\nLet’s write S(n) = sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)) = -sum_{k=0}^{m} cos^{2n}((2k+1)π/(2n+1)) + sum_{k=1}^{m} cos^{2n}(2kπ/(2n+1))}, where m is floor(n/2). But this might not help directly.\n\nAnother idea: note that the term cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)) can be written as [cos(jπ/(2n+1))]^{2n}. For large n, j can be up to n, so the angles go up to approximately j= n: jπ/(2n+1) ≈ π/2. So cos(π/2)=0, but near π/2, cosine is small. Therefore, the terms near j=n contribute almost nothing, while terms near j=1 contribute more. So perhaps the dominant contribution comes from small j.\n\nLet’s approximate the sum S(n) by the first few terms. For large n, j=1: cos^{2n}(π/(2n+1)) ≈ [1 - (π^2)/(2*(2n+1)^2)]^{2n} ≈ e^{- π^2/(4(2n+1))} ≈ 1 - π^2/(4(2n+1)). Similarly for j=2: cos^{2n}(2π/(2n+1)) ≈ e^{- (2π)^2/(4(2n+1))} ≈1 - (4π^2)/(4(2n+1))=1 - π^2/(2n+1). But since these exponents are small, the terms are approximately 1 - O(1/n), so for large n, they are close to 1. So S(n) ≈ sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j [1 - O(1/n)] ≈ sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j - O(1/n) sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j. The first term is the alternating sum, which is -1/2 + (-1)^{n}/2. The second term is negligible if n is large. Therefore, S(n) ≈ -1/2 + (-1)^n /2. Then 1 + 2 S(n) ≈1 +2*(-1/2 + (-1)^n /2)=1 -1 + (-1)^n = (-1)^n. Therefore, [1 + 2 S(n)]^2 =1. Then g(n)=16^n *1, so g(n)=16^n. Therefore, g(n+1)-g(n)=16^{n+1} -16^n=15*16^n, which tends to infinity. But this contradicts the problem statement that the limit exists. So there must be a flaw in this approximation.\n\nWait, but the approximation assumed that all terms in the sum S(n) contribute like (-1)^j, which leads to the alternating sum. But in reality, the cosine terms are less than 1, so the terms decay with j. Therefore, the sum S(n) is actually less than the alternating sum, and perhaps converges to a certain value. Let's reconsider.\n\nLet’s consider the sum S(n) = sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)). For large n, and j=1,2,...,n. Let’s make substitution: let x = j/(2n+1), so j = x(2n+1), and as n→infty, x ranges from 0 to approximately 1/2. Then, the angle jπ/(2n+1)=πx. The sum S(n) becomes sum_{x=1/(2n+1)}^{n/(2n+1)} (-1)^{x(2n+1)} cos^{2n}(πx) * (2n+1)Δx, where Δx=1/(2n+1). But since x must be such that j is integer, this is a Riemann sum approximation. However, the term (-1)^{x(2n+1)} is problematic because x(2n+1)=j, which is integer, so (-1)^j. Therefore, S(n) ≈ (2n+1) ∫_0^{1/2} (-1)^{(2n+1)x} cos^{2n}(πx) dx. This is a challenging integral due to the oscillatory term (-1)^{(2n+1)x}. Let's note that (-1)^{(2n+1)x} = e^{iπ(2n+1)x}. For large n, this oscillates rapidly except when x is near certain points. Perhaps we can use the method of stationary phase or steepest descent.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for large n, the main contributions to the integral come from regions where the cosine term is not too small. The function cos^{2n}(πx) peaks around x=0, because cos(πx) is maximized at x=0. So the integrand is significant only near x=0. Let’s expand around x=0. Let x be small, so πx≈y, small. Then cos(πx)=1 - y²/2 + ..., so cos^{2n}(πx)≈e^{-n y²} = e^{-n π² x²}. Also, (-1)^{(2n+1)x} = e^{iπ(2n+1)x} = e^{iπ(2n+1)x}. So the integral becomes approximately ∫_0^\\infty e^{iπ(2n+1)x} e^{-n π² x²} dx. Let’s change variables: let t = π x sqrt(n). Then x = t/(π sqrt(n)), dx=dt/(π sqrt(n)). The integral becomes ∫_0^\\infty e^{iπ(2n+1) t/(π sqrt(n))} e^{-n π² (t^2)/(π² n)} * dt/(π sqrt(n)) = 1/(π sqrt(n)) ∫_0^\\infty e^{i(2n+1)t/sqrt(n)} e^{-t^2} dt. For large n, (2n+1)/sqrt(n) ≈ 2 sqrt(n). So the exponent becomes i 2 sqrt(n) t. So the integral is dominated by the rapidly oscillating term e^{i 2 sqrt(n) t}, multiplied by e^{-t^2}. Using the method of stationary phase, the integral is negligible except near t=0. But e^{-t^2} is also peaked at t=0. The product of a Gaussian and a rapidly oscillating function tends to zero due to cancellation. Therefore, the integral tends to zero as n→infty. Therefore, S(n) ≈0. Then, 1 + 2 S(n)≈1, so g(n)=16^n *1. Then g(n+1)-g(n)=16^{n+1}-16^n=15*16^n, which tends to infinity. But this contradicts the problem's requirement that the limit exists. Therefore, our approximation must be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the leading term cancels out, and the next term in the expansion gives a finite contribution. Let’s revisit the approximation of S(n). Earlier, we considered j fixed and expanding around x=0, but maybe we need to consider a different scaling.\n\nLet’s make the substitution j = k sqrt(n), assuming that j scales with sqrt(n). Then, jπ/(2n+1) ≈ k π/(2 sqrt(n))). Then, cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1))≈ [1 - (k^2 π^2)/(8n)]^{2n}≈e^{-k^2 π^2/4}. Then, the sum S(n)≈sum_{k=1}^{sqrt(n)} (-1)^{k sqrt(n)} e^{-k^2 π^2/4} * sqrt(n). But (-1)^{k sqrt(n)} is highly oscillatory unless sqrt(n) is even or odd. This seems messy. Perhaps if n is even, sqrt(n) is integer or not. This approach might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum S(n) is similar to an alternating series where the terms decrease in absolute value. By the alternating series test, if |a_j| decreases monotonically to zero, the sum converges. Here, |a_j|=cos^{2n}(jπ/(2n+1)). For fixed n, does this sequence decrease as j increases? Yes, because j increases, the angle increases, cos decreases, so cos^{2n} decreases. Therefore, the terms alternate in sign and decrease in absolute value. Therefore, the sum S(n) is bounded by the first term. |S(n)| ≤ cos^{2n}(π/(2n+1)) ≈1 - π^2/(4n). But as n increases, this approaches 1. So this doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the expression [1 + 2 S(n)] might tend to zero as n increases. For example, if S(n) ≈ -1/2, then [1 + 2 S(n)]≈0. If that's the case, then g(n)≈16^n *0=0, and the difference g(n+1)-g(n)≈0-0=0. But earlier manual calculations showed g(n) fluctuating.\n\nWait, maybe there's a identity or formula that relates this sum to a closed-form expression. The presence of cos^{2n} and the alternating sum suggests perhaps a combinatorial identity or a complex analysis approach. Let’s consider using complex numbers. Let’s write cosθ = (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ})/2. Then, cos^{2n}θ = (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ})^{2n}/4^{2n}. Expand this using the binomial theorem: sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n,k) e^{iθ(2n -k)} e^{-iθ k} /4^{2n} = sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n,k) e^{iθ(2n -2k)} /4^{2n}. Therefore, cos^{2n}θ = 4^{-2n} sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n,k) e^{i2θ(n -k)}. But I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nSubstituting back into S(n):\n\nS(n) = sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j * 4^{-2n} sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n,k) e^{i2*(jπ/(2n+1))*(n -k)}.\n\nInterchange the sums:\n\nS(n) = 4^{-2n} sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n,k) sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j e^{i2jπ(n -k)/(2n+1)}.\n\nThe inner sum is a geometric series: sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j e^{i2πj(n -k)/(2n+1)}.\n\nLet’s denote ω = e^{i2π(n -k)/(2n+1) - iπ} (since (-1)^j = e^{-iπ j}), so the sum becomes sum_{j=1}^n [ω]^j.\n\nThis is a geometric series with ratio ω: sum_{j=1}^n ω^j = ω(1 - ω^n)/(1 - ω), provided ω ≠1.\n\nTherefore, S(n) = 4^{-2n} sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n,k) * [ω(1 - ω^n)/(1 - ω)].\n\nThis seems quite complex, but maybe for certain values of k, the terms simplify. For example, when n -k =0 mod (2n+1), but since k ranges from 0 to 2n, n -k can range from -2n to n. Not sure. Alternatively, if n -k = m(2n+1), but for m integer, this would require k =n -m(2n+1), but k must be between 0 and 2n. Only possible if m=0, so k=n. Therefore, when k=n, the exponent becomes zero, and ω = e^{-iπ} = -1. Therefore, the term for k=n becomes sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j *1 = sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j, which is the same as before. But this leads us back to the alternating sum, which isn't helpful.\n\nPerhaps this approach is too involved. Let's think differently. The problem is to show that the limit of g(n+1) -g(n) exists as n→infty. If we can show that g(n) approaches a certain function with a derivative-like difference approaching a constant, then the limit exists. Alternatively, perhaps find an asymptotic expansion of g(n) for large n, then compute the difference.\n\nGiven that g(n) =16^n [1 + 2 S(n)]^2, and we need to find the limit of g(n+1)-g(n). Let's denote L(n) = [1 + 2 S(n)]. Then, g(n)=16^n L(n)^2. Then, the difference is 16^{n+1} L(n+1)^2 -16^n L(n)^2 =16^n [16 L(n+1)^2 - L(n)^2]. To find the limit of this as n→infty, we need to analyze the behavior of L(n).\n\nAssuming that as n→infty, L(n) behaves like C/n^α for some α, then 16 L(n+1)^2 ~16 C^2 / (n+1)^{2α} ~16 C^2 /n^{2α}, and L(n)^2 ~C^2 /n^{2α}. Then, 16 L(n+1)^2 - L(n)^2 ~ (16 C^2 - C^2)/n^{2α} =15 C^2 /n^{2α}. Multiply by 16^n: 15 C^2 16^n /n^{2α}. This tends to zero only if α >0, but even then, 16^n grows exponentially, so unless C^2 /n^{2α} decays exponentially, which it doesn't, the entire expression tends to infinity. Therefore, unless L(n) decays exponentially, which would require L(n) ~e^{-kn}, then 16^n e^{-2kn} would decay if k > ln4. But in that case, the difference would be 16^{n+1} e^{-2k(n+1)} -16^n e^{-2kn} =16^n e^{-2kn} (16 e^{-2k} -1). For this to have a limit, 16 e^{-2k} -1 must be a constant, but then unless k is such that 16 e^{-2k}=1, i.e., k= ln4. Then, g(n)=16^n e^{-2 ln4 n}=16^n 4^{-2n}=16^n 16^{-n}=1. Then the difference would be 1 -1=0. But this would require L(n)=e^{- ln4 n}=4^{-n}, which would make g(n)=16^n (4^{-2n})=16^n 16^{-n}=1, so the difference is zero. However, this is speculative and needs verification.\n\nIf [1 + 2 S(n)] ~ C 4^{-n}, then g(n)=16^n C^2 16^{-n}=C^2. So g(n) approaches a constant, hence the difference g(n+1)-g(n) approaches zero. But does [1 + 2 S(n)] behave like C 4^{-n}? If so, then the limit exists and is zero. But we need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the expression [1 + 2 S(n)] might be related to the probability generating function of a random walk or something similar. The presence of alternating signs and cosines to the power of 2n suggests a combinatorial interpretation, perhaps using generating functions or orthogonality relations.\n\nAnother approach: note that the expression inside the square is similar to a Chebyshev polynomial or a root of unity filter. The sum involving (-1)^j and cos^{2n} might relate to evaluating a polynomial at specific points.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the time I've spent without making progress, I think the key is to recognize that as n becomes large, the sum S(n) becomes negligible compared to 1/2, such that [1 + 2 S(n)] approaches zero rapidly, and when squared and multiplied by 16^n, it balances out to a constant. Therefore, the difference g(n+1)-g(n) approaches a constant value, hence the limit exists. Alternatively, since the problem asks to prove the existence of the limit without specifying its value, it might be sufficient to show that the difference approaches a constant through asymptotic analysis.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure. Given the example provided in the problem, which involved modular arithmetic and factorization, this problem seems different, involving limits and trigonometric sums. The key step is likely to approximate the sum S(n) asymptotically, show that [1 + 2 S(n)] behaves like C /4^n, leading to g(n) approaching C^2, and hence the difference approaching zero. Or another behavior leading to a finite limit.\n\nGiven that the problem is from Math Stack Exchange and the user asks for the first step, the first step might be to analyze the sum S(n) and find its asymptotic behavior as n becomes large, possibly using approximations like Laplace's method for sums or recognizing a probabilistic interpretation.\n\nIn conclusion, the assumptions needed are that n is a positive integer approaching infinity, and the problem is to prove the existence of the limit of the difference g(n+1)-g(n). The formatted problem should list assumptions related to n being an integer and tending to infinity, but since the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, the key assumption is that n is an integer approaching infinity.",
