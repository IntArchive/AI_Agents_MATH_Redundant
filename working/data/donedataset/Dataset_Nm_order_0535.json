    "Content": "Dixon's Identity states:\n$$ \\sum_{k} (-1)^k\\binom {a+b}{b+k}\\binom{b+c}{c+k}\\binom{c+a}{a+k} = \\binom{a+b+c}\n{a,b,c}$$ A bit of history: \nThe case $a=b=c$ was proved by Dixon in 1891 using trigonometric integrals. He proved the general case 11 years later using other analytical methods.  In 1916, MacMahon proved his master theorem which gives another short analytical proof for the identity. Using the WZ-method, Zeilberger gave a short proof in 1990 (with the aid of his computer).\nIn 2003, Victor Guo gave a short proof using polynomials. But what really interests me are the combinatorial interpretations. Zeilberger gives a proof using sign-reversing involutions in this lecture (starting from 39:30). Does it exist in some paper? I believe he credits it to Foata in this opinion . In this monograph by Foata , there seems to be a combinatorial proof of Dixon's identity and other related identities (pages 37 to 40). I wasn't able to understand the part in pages 37-38, where the following is derived combinatorially: \n$$\\binom{b+c}{c+k}\\binom{c+a}{a+k}\\binom{a+b}{b+k}=\\sum_{n\\ge |k|} \\binom{a+b+c-n}{a-n,b-n,c-n,n+k,n-k}$$\nWhere both sides seem to count directed graphs with the following adjacency matrix:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & c+k & b-k \\\\ c-k & 0 & a+k\\\\ b+k & a-k & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\nThe LHS counts it directly, and the RHS counts it by decomposing by using 5 basic cycles: $1\\to 2 \\to 1$ (appearing $a-n$ times), $1\\to 3 \\to 1$ ($b-n$ times), $2\\to 3 \\to 2$ ($c-n$ times), $1\\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$ ($n+k$ times), $1\\to 3 \\to 2 \\to 1$ ($n-k$ times). But I don't really understand how they actually count it. Here's a picture of the relevant pages: Is the paper \"100 years of Dixon's identity\" by James Ward (published in 1991 in the Irish Mathematical Society Bulletin\") available online?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here are some remarks on the identity proof related to your second question.\nHopefully they will make you understand everything, feel free to ask more about this\nproof. Remark 1 Brian Hopkins’ comment is half correct and half incorrect. It is indeed\ntrue that loops are forbidden (this is indicated by the “$i\\neq j$” statement on the second line of p.37). On the other hand, multiple edges are definitely needed (and allowed) : otherwise, you could hardly multiply two cycles together and the whole proof would be nonsensical. Remark 2 Your cycle is not a counterexample, as it can be decomposed\nas $[123][132]$ or $[132][123]$, depending on how you number your multiple\nedges. It is very important to remember that the multiple edges are NUMBERED,\nthis is what allows us to make the product of cycles to be non-commutative (see\nthe definition of the product on the middle of p.15). Remark 3 The integers $a,b,c,n,k$ in formulas (1),(2),(3) on the bottom\nof page 37 are uniquely defined by \n$$\na=\\varepsilon_3+\\frac{\\varepsilon_4+\\varepsilon_5}{2}, \\\nb=\\varepsilon_2+\\frac{\\varepsilon_4+\\varepsilon_5}{2}, \\\nc=\\varepsilon_1+\\frac{\\varepsilon_4+\\varepsilon_5}{2}, \\\nn=\\frac{\\varepsilon_4+\\varepsilon_5}{2}, \\\nk=\\frac{\\varepsilon_4-\\varepsilon_5}{2}\n$$ Remark 4 There is a typo in the formula for matrix $N$ on the top\nof p.38 : the $(3,2)$ coefficient should be $a+k$ (not $b-k$ as it is printed).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is talking about Dixon's Identity and a combinatorial proof. The main problem seems to be understanding a specific part of Foata's monograph where a combinatorial interpretation is given. The user mentions that they weren't able to understand pages 37-38 where an equation is derived combinatorially. The equation presented is:\n\n$$\\binom{b+c}{c+k}\\binom{c+a}{a+k}\\binom{a+b}{b+k}=\\sum_{n\\ge |k|} \\binom{a+b+c-n}{a-n,b-n,c-n,n+k,n-k}$$\n\nThe user also describes the context where both sides count directed graphs with a specific adjacency matrix. The LHS directly counts it, while the RHS uses a decomposition involving basic cycles. The user is confused about how the counting works on both sides.\n\nNow, applying the format. The Assumption section should list each condition or property applied to one object. The problem statement is the actual problem the user wants to solve or understand.\n\nLooking at the example given in the problem, the assumptions were about the integer n and its divisibility by 7. Here, the assumptions would relate to the combinatorial interpretation presented in Foata's work. \n\nSo, the problem here is understanding the combinatorial proof of the given equation. The assumptions would include the definitions or conditions that each side of the equation counts directed graphs with the specified adjacency matrix, and the decomposition into cycles as described.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition. Let me parse the relevant parts:\n\n1. The left-hand side (LHS) counts directed graphs with the adjacency matrix:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & c+k & b-k \\\\ c-k & 0 & a+k\\\\ b+k & a-k & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n2. The right-hand side (RHS) counts the same directed graphs by decomposing them into five basic cycles:\n   - $1\\to 2 \\to 1$ appearing $a-n$ times,\n   - $1\\to 3 \\to 1$ appearing $b-n$ times,\n   - $2\\to 3 \\to 2$ appearing $c-n$ times,\n   - $1\\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$ appearing $n+k$ times,\n   - $1\\to 3 \\to 2 \\to 1$ appearing $n-k$ times.\n\n3. Both sides count the same set of directed graphs.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to understand how the combinatorial proof works, i.e., to show the equality of LHS and RHS by interpreting both as counting the same directed graphs in different ways.\n\nBut the user is specifically asking for help in understanding the counting on both sides. So the problem statement would be the equation itself, and the assumptions are the combinatorial interpretations given for each side.\n\nWait, the original problem in the example had the problem statement as proving the divisibility. Here, the problem is to understand or prove the given combinatorial equation, but the user's actual problem is to understand how the counting works. However, the format requires structuring the problem as per the assumptions and the problem.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated information, and structure it into Assumption and Problem parts as in the example. The example took the original problem, extracted the key assumptions (like n is integer, n divisible by 7), and then the problem statement.\n\nIn the current case, the problem the user is struggling with is the combinatorial proof of the equation between binomial coefficients. The assumptions would be the combinatorial interpretations provided in Foata's work. Let's extract those.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The left-hand side counts directed graphs with the adjacency matrix [[0, c+k, b-k], [c-k, 0, a+k], [b+k, a-k, 0]].\n- The right-hand side counts the same directed graphs by decomposing them into five types of cycles with specified counts.\n- Each term in the sum on the RHS corresponds to a decomposition with parameters a-n, b-n, c-n, n+k, n-k.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\\binom{b+c}{c+k}\\binom{c+a}{a+k}\\binom{a+b}{b+k}=\\sum_{n\\ge |k|} \\binom{a+b+c-n}{a-n,b-n,c-n,n+k,n-k}$$\nusing a combinatorial interpretation involving directed graphs as described.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as understanding the combinatorial proof of the equation, given the assumptions about the directed graphs.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about understanding how both sides count the directed graphs. So the problem is to show the equality by interpreting both sides combinatorially as counting the same objects in different ways.\n\nThus, the assumptions are the combinatorial definitions of each side, and the problem is the equation to be proven combinatorially.",
