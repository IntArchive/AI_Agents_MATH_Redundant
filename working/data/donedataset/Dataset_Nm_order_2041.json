    "Content": "I've got a question: I'm trying to prove that every metric space is compact if and only if the space is sequentially compact. In all the proofs I have found, they used the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Is there a way to prove this fact without using Bolzano-Weierstrass? Thanks so much!!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Theorem Let $(M,d)$ be a metric space. The following are equivalent: (a) $M$ is compact; (b) $M$ is sequentially compact; (c) $M$ is complete and totally bounded. Proof: (a $\\Rightarrow$ b) Suppose $M$ is compact, and let $(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $M$ . Suppose that the sequence $(x_n)$ did not have a convergent subsequence, that is, $(x_n)$ does not have a cluster point. Then for every $x\\in M$ , there exists some neighbourhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $\\left\\{n:x_n\\in U_x\\right\\}$ is finite. Then $\\left\\{U_x:x\\in M\\right\\}$ is an open cover of $M$ , so by compactness we can find a finite subcover $U_1,\\ldots,U_{k}$ . But notice that $\\mathbb{N}=\\left\\{n:x_n\\in M\\right\\}=\\cup_{i=1}^k\\left\\{n:x_n\\in U_i\\right\\}$ , and the latter set is finite, a contradiction. Therefore, $(x_n)$ has a cluster point, hence a convergent subsequence. (b $\\Rightarrow$ c) Suppose $M$ is sequentially compact. Since every Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence, it follows that $M$ is complete. Also, if $M$ was not totally bounded, there would exist some $\\varepsilon>0$ such that no finite collection of open balls of radius $\\varepsilon$ covers $M$ . Let $B_1=B(x_1,\\varepsilon)$ be one such ball. Then, let $x_2\\in M\\setminus B_1$ , and let $B_2=B(x_2,\\varepsilon)$ . Then, let $x_3\\in M\\setminus (B_1\\cup B_2)$ . Continuing this way, we find a sequence $x_1,x_2,\\ldots$ such that $x_{n+1}\\in M\\setminus\\cup_{i=1}^nB(x_i,\\varepsilon)$ , hence $d(x_n,x_m)\\geq\\varepsilon$ whenever $n\\neq m$ , so $(x_n)$ cannot have a convergent subsequence, a contradiction. Thus, $M$ is also totally bounded. (c $\\Rightarrow$ a) Suppose that $M$ is complete and totally bounded. In order to find a contradiction, suppose that $M$ was not compact, so there exists some open cover $\\left\\{U_i:i\\in I\\right\\}$ which does not admit a finite subcover. We can cover $M$ by a finite number of sets $C^1_1,\\ldots,C^1_{p_1}$ of diameter $\\leq 1$ (since $M$ is totally bounded). One of these sets, say $C^1=C^1_{k_1}$ , cannot be covered by a finite number of sets $U_i$ (if all could, we would find a finite subcover for $M$ ). Now, $C^1$ can be covered by a finite number of subsets $C^2_1,\\ldots,C^2_{p_2}$ of diameter $\\leq 1/2$ . Again, one of the sets, say $C^2=C^2_{k_2}$ , cannot be covered by a finite number of sets $U_i$ . Proceeding this way, we find (non-empty) sets $C^1\\supseteq C^2\\supseteq C^3\\supseteq\\cdots$ such that $C^k$ has diameter $\\leq 1/k$ and $C^k$ cannot be covered by a finite number of sets $U_i$ . Let $x_k\\in C^k$ be an arbitrary element for every $k$ . Then $(x_k)_k$ is Cauchy (by the condition on the diameters), so it converges to some $x\\in M$ . This $x$ belongs to some $U_i$ , as $\\left\\{U_i:i\\in I\\right\\}$ covers $M$ , so there exists some $\\delta$ such that $B(x,\\delta)\\subseteq U_i$ . Letting $N$ be sufficiently large, so that $d(x,x_N)<\\delta/2$ and $1/N<\\delta/2$ , we obtain $C^N\\subseteq B(x_N,1/N)\\subseteq B(x_N,\\delta/2)\\subseteq B(x,\\delta)\\subseteq U_i$ , contradicting the construction of $C^N$ . Therefore, $M$ is compact.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that in metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness without using Bolzano-Weierstrass. First, I need to recall the definitions.\n\nCompactness means every open cover has a finite subcover. Sequential compactness means every sequence has a convergent subsequence. In metric spaces, these are usually equivalent, but standard proofs often use Bolzano-Weierstrass, which states that every bounded sequence in Euclidean space has a convergent subsequence. The user wants to avoid that.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to show equivalence without invoking Bolzano-Weierstrass. But in general metric spaces, Bolzano-Weierstrass isn't applicable since it's specific to Euclidean space. Hmm, perhaps the original proofs the user saw were in a specific context like R^n, but here it's about general metric spaces. So maybe the user is confused because in general metric spaces, the approach is different.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the user says \"every metric space is compact if and only if the space is sequentially compact\". But in reality, for metric spaces, compactness, sequential compactness, and limit point compactness are all equivalent. The standard proof uses that in metric spaces, compactness implies limit point compactness (which is equivalent to sequential compactness in metric spaces). But perhaps the user's confusion comes from proofs in specific contexts where Bolzano-Weierstrass is used, like in Euclidean space.\n\nSo to rephrase the problem without using Bolzano-Weierstrass, we need to use properties of metric spaces. Let me think. The key steps are usually showing compactness implies sequential compactness by using total boundedness and completeness. Conversely, sequential compactness implies compactness by showing that sequentially compact metric spaces are totally bounded and complete, hence compact by the Heine-Borel theorem for metric spaces. Wait, but Heine-Borel in general metric spaces requires total boundedness and completeness. However, Heine-Borel in Euclidean space is the one that uses closed and bounded, which is where Bolzano-Weierstrass comes into play.\n\nSo perhaps the standard proof for general metric spaces doesn't rely on Bolzano-Weierstrass, which is specific to Euclidean spaces. Therefore, the user might have seen proofs in the context of Euclidean space using Bolzano-Weierstrass, but in general metric spaces, the proof is different. Therefore, the answer would involve showing the equivalence in metric spaces using total boundedness, completeness, and the properties of sequences and covers without invoking Bolzano-Weierstrass.\n\nBut the problem is to structure the user's question into the specified format. The original question is asking for help to prove the equivalence without using Bolzano-Weierstrass. The assumptions here would be that the space is a metric space, and the properties of compactness and sequential compactness. But the user isn't adding extra conditions, just the general case. So the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is a metric space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the space is compact if and only if it is sequentially compact.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions like n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the user is talking about a general metric space. So the only assumption is that the space is a metric space. The problem is to prove the equivalence between compactness and sequential compactness. The user's confusion comes from proofs that use Bolzano-Weierstrass, which might not be applicable in general metric spaces. Therefore, the structured problem would list the metric space as the assumption and the problem is the equivalence.",
