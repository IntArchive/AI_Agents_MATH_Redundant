    "Content": "I'm studying for my exam of linear algebra.. I want to prove the following corollary: If $A$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix then each entry $a_{ii}> 0$, ie all the elements of the diagonal of the matrix are positive. My teacher gave a suggestion to consider the unit vector \"$e_i$\", but I see that is using it. $a_{ii} >0$ for each $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. For any $i$, define $x = (x_j)$ by $x_i =1$ and by $x_j =0$, if $j\\neq i$, since $x \\neq 0$, then: $0< x^TAx = a_{ii}$ But my teacher says my proof is ambiguous. How I can use the unit vector $e_1$ for the demonstration?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $e_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ , and so on, where $e_i$ is a vector of all zeros, except for a $1$ in the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ place. Since $A$ is positive definite, then $x^T A x > 0$ for any non-zero vector $x \\in \\Bbb R^n$ . Then, $e_1^T A e_1 > 0$ , and likewise for $e_2, e_3$ and so on. If the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ diagonal entry of $A$ was not positive, $a_{ii} < 0$ , then $e_i^T A e_i = 0\\cdot a_{11}\\cdot 0 + 1\\cdot a_{12}\\cdot 0 + \\cdots + 1\\cdot a_{ii}\\cdot 1 + \\cdots + 0\\cdot a_{nn} \\cdot 0$ , since $e_i$ has zeros everywhere but in the $i^{\\rm th}$ spot. Thus, what would happen if $a_{ii}$ was negative?",
    "llm_answer_create_structured_problem": "###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$A$ is a symmetric matrix,\n$A$ is a positive definite matrix.\nProblem: \nProve that every diagonal entry $a_{ii}$ of $A$ is positive.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe problem requires proving that all diagonal elements of a symmetric positive definite matrix $A$ are positive. The assumptions explicitly state that $A$ is symmetric and positive definite. The core idea is to use the definition of positive definiteness: for any non-zero vector $x$, $x^TAx > 0$. By choosing $x = e_i$ (the unit vector with 1 at the $i$-th position and 0 elsewhere), the quadratic form simplifies to $x^TAx = a_{ii}$, which must be positive. This directly demonstrates $a_{ii} > 0$ for all $i$.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the user wants to prove that if a matrix A is symmetric positive definite, then each diagonal entry a_{ii} is positive. The teacher suggested using the unit vector e_i, but the user's proof was considered ambiguous. Let me see how to approach this properly.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of a positive definite matrix. A matrix A is positive definite if for any non-zero vector x, the quadratic form x^T A x is positive. That's the key property here. Since A is symmetric, we also know it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, but maybe that's not directly needed here.\n\nThe user mentioned using the vector x defined as x_i = 1 and x_j = 0 for j ≠ i. Then they computed x^T A x and got a_{ii}, which should be greater than 0. Wait, that seems correct. Maybe the teacher thought the explanation was too brief or didn't properly justify why x^T A x equals a_{ii}. Let's check that.\n\nIf x is the standard basis vector e_i, which has 1 in the i-th position and 0 elsewhere, then when you compute x^T A x, it's equivalent to multiplying the i-th row of A with the i-th column of x. Since x is e_i, the only non-zero entry is in the i-th position, so the multiplication would pick out the (i,i)-th entry of A, which is a_{ii}. Therefore, x^T A x = a_{ii}, and since A is positive definite, this must be greater than 0. \n\nBut maybe the user didn't clearly state that x is the unit vector e_i, or didn't explain why x^T A x simplifies to a_{ii}. The teacher's suggestion to use e_i is exactly this approach. Perhaps the user's original proof was too terse, not specifying that x is a unit vector, hence the ambiguity.\n\nSo the structured problem should list the assumptions: A is a symmetric matrix, A is positive definite, and then the problem is to prove each diagonal entry a_{ii} is positive. The key assumption here is that A is symmetric and positive definite. The unit vector e_i is used to pick out the diagonal entry via the quadratic form.",
