    "Content": "First for clarity I'll define things as I'm familiar with them: A compactification of a non-compact topological space $X$ is a compact topological space $Y$ such that $X$ can be densely embedded in $Y$ . In particular a compactification is said to be a one-point compactification if $\\left|Y\\backslash X\\right|=1$ The Alexandroff one-point compactification of a a topological space $\\left(X,\\mathcal{T}_{X}\\right)$ is the set $X^{*}=X\\cup\\left\\{ \\infty\\right\\}$ for some element $\\infty\\notin X$ given the topology $$\\mathcal{T}^{*}:=\\mathcal{T}_{X}\\cup\\left\\{ U\\subseteq X^{*}\\,|\\,\\infty\\in U\\,\\wedge\\, X\\backslash U\\,\\mbox{is compact and closed in }\\left(X,\\mathcal{T}_{X}\\right)\\right\\}$$ If $\\left(X,\\mathcal{T}_{X}\\right)$ is a Hausdorff space one can omit the requirement that $X\\backslash U$ is closed. It is easy to show that given two choices of elements $\\infty_{1},\\infty_{2}\\notin X$ the one-point compactifications $X\\cup\\left\\{ \\infty_{1}\\right\\}$ and $X\\cup\\left\\{ \\infty_{2}\\right\\}$ with the topology defined as that of the Alexandroff one-point compactification are homeomorphic. What I'm wondering is why isn't there another possible way to define the topology on $X^{*}$ that would also yield a compactification (which is in particular not homeomorphic to the Alexandroff one-point topology) As far as I see it there are two approaches to answering this question: Show that any topology on $X^{*}$ that yields a compact space in which $X$ is dense is homeomorphic to $\\mathcal{T}^{*}$ . Show it's not possible to construct any other topology on $X^{*}$ that results in a compactification. I'm quite interested in seeing the reasoning to both approaches if possible.\nThanks in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You get the uniqueness result if the space is Hausdorff. Let $\\langle X,\\tau\\rangle$ be a compact space. Suppose that $p\\in X$ is in the closure of $Y=X\\setminus\\{p\\}$ , and let $\\tau_Y$ be the associated subspace topology on $Y$ ; $\\langle X,\\tau\\rangle$ is then a compactification of $\\langle Y,\\tau_Y\\rangle$ . Suppose that $p\\in U\\in\\tau$ , and let $V=U\\cap Y$ . Then $\\varnothing\\ne V\\in\\tau_Y$ , so $Y\\setminus V$ is closed in $Y$ . Moreover, $Y\\setminus V=X\\setminus U$ is also closed in $X$ , which is compact, so $Y\\setminus V$ is compact. That is, every open nbhd of $p$ in $X$ is the complement of a compact, closed subset of $Y$ . Thus, if $\\tau'$ is the topology on $X$ that makes it a copy of the Alexandroff compactification of $Y$ , then $\\tau\\subseteq\\tau'$ . Now let $K\\subseteq Y$ be compact and closed in $Y$ , and let $V=Y\\setminus K\\in\\tau_Y$ . If $X\\setminus K=V\\cup\\{p\\}\\notin\\tau$ , then $p\\in\\operatorname{cl}_XK$ . If $X$ is Hausdorff, this is impossible: in that case $K$ is a compact subset of the Hausdorff space $X$ and is therefore closed in $X$ . Thus, if $X$ is Hausdorff we must have $\\tau=\\tau'$ , and $X$ is (homeomorphic to) the Alexandroff compactification of $Y$ . If $X$ is not Hausdorff, however, we can have $\\tau\\subsetneqq\\tau'$ . A simple example is the sequence with two limits. Let $D$ be a countably infinite set, let $p$ and $q$ be distinct points not in $D$ , and let $X=D\\cup\\{p,q\\}$ . Points of $D$ are isolated. Basic open nbhds of $p$ are the sets of the form $\\{p\\}\\cup(D\\setminus F)$ for finite $F\\subseteq D$ , and basic open nbhds of $q$ are the sets of the form $\\{q\\}\\cup(D\\setminus F)$ for finite $F\\subseteq D$ . Let $Y=D\\cup\\{q\\}$ . Then $Y$ is dense in $X$ , and $X$ is compact, and $Y$ itself is a closed, compact subset of $Y$ whose complement is not open in $X$ . Improved example (1 June 2015): Let $D$ and $E$ be disjoint countably infinite sets, let $p$ and $q$ be distinct points not in $D\\cup E$ , let $X=D\\cup E\\cup\\{p,q\\}$ , and let $Y=D\\cup E\\cup\\{q\\}$ . Points of $D\\cup E$ are isolated. Basic open nbhds of $q$ are the sets of the form $\\{q\\}\\cup (E\\setminus F)$ for finite $F\\subseteq E$ , and basic open nbhds of $p$ are the sets of the form $\\{p\\}\\cup\\big((D\\cup E)\\setminus F\\big)$ for finite $F\\subseteq D\\cup E$ . Then $Y$ is a non-compact dense subspace of the compact space $X$ , so $X$ is a (non-Hausdorff) compactification of $Y$ . Let $K=\\{q\\}\\cup E$ . Then $K$ is a compact closed subset of $Y$ , but $X\\setminus K=\\{p\\}\\cup D$ is not open in $X$ . (This avoids the question of whether it’s legitimate to look at the Alexandrov compactification of a compact space.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking why the one-point compactification of a space is unique up to homeomorphism, specifically why no other topology on X* (which is X union a point at infinity) can result in a different compactification that isn't homeomorphic to the Alexandroff one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A one-point compactification adds a single point ∞ to X, making the space compact, with X embedded densely. The topology for the Alexandroff compactification includes all open sets from X plus neighborhoods around ∞ that are complements of compact closed sets in X (and if X is Hausdorff, just compact sets).\n\nThe user mentions two approaches: either show any other topology that makes X* compact with X dense must be homeomorphic to Alexandroff's, or show that no other such topology exists. The answer probably involves the uniqueness of the compactification under certain conditions.\n\nI remember that compactifications can be unique if they satisfy certain universal properties. For the one-point case, maybe any two such compactifications must be homeomorphic because the way neighborhoods around ∞ are defined is forced by the requirement of compactness and the density of X.\n\nLet me think about Approach 1: Suppose there's another topology τ on X* making it a one-point compactification. Then, since X is dense and open in X* (because in the Alexandroff topology, X is open as it's in τ_X), the neighborhoods of ∞ must be the complements of compact sets in X. Otherwise, the space might not be compact. For instance, if you have a different topology where neighborhoods of ∞ are not related to compact sets, then X* might not be compact. So maybe the topology has to be such that open sets containing ∞ are exactly the complements of compact subsets of X. If that's the case, then any such topology would have the same open sets as Alexandroff's, hence homeomorphic.\n\nAlternatively, suppose there's another topology. Then, the inclusion map from X to X* would be an embedding, and the compactness would require that every open cover of X* must include a neighborhood of ∞, whose complement is compact in X. Therefore, the topology around ∞ is determined by the compact subsets of X. Since the topology on X is fixed, the way to add ∞ is unique up to homeomorphism.\n\nAnother angle: If you have two one-point compactifications Y1 and Y2, then the identity map on X can be extended to a map between Y1 and Y2 by sending ∞1 to ∞2. To be a homeomorphism, this map needs to be continuous in both directions. The continuity would rely on the neighborhoods of ∞1 and ∞2 corresponding under the map, which they do if both topologies are defined via the complements of compact sets. Hence, the topologies must be equivalent.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are that X is embedded densely in X*, the compactification has only one extra point, and the topology must make X* compact. These conditions force the topology to be the Alexandroff one. Therefore, any other topology either doesn't make X* compact, or isn't a compactification (i.e., X isn't dense), or is homeomorphic via the above reasoning.",
