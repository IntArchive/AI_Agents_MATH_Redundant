Then show that $\\sup(A)+\\sup(B)$ is less than or equal to $\\sup(A+B)$ by showing that $\\sup(A+B)$ is an upper bound for $A+\\sup(B)$ and that $\\sup(A+\\sup(B)) = \\sup(A)+\\sup(B)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the supremum of the set A+B is equal to the sum of the suprema of A and B. Let me parse the question carefully.\n\nThe title says: \"How can I prove sup(A+B)=sup A+sup B if A+B={a+b | a∈A, b∈ B}\". The question body adds that A and B are non-empty, upper bounded sets. So the conditions here are:\n\n1. A is a non-empty set.\n2. B is a non-empty set.\n3. A is upper bounded.\n4. B is upper bounded.\n5. A + B is defined as the set {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}.\n\nEach of these should be separate assumptions. The problem is to prove that sup(A+B) = sup A + sup B.\n\nWait, let me check the example given. In the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Here, \"A and B are non-empty\" could be split into two separate assumptions: A is non-empty, B is non-empty. Similarly, \"upper bounded\" applies to each set individually. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- A is a non-empty set.\n- B is a non-empty set.\n- A is upper bounded.\n- B is upper bounded.\n- A + B is the set of all a + b where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nThen the problem is to prove sup(A+B) = sup A + sup B.\n\nI should make sure that each assumption is a single condition on one object. The example had two separate assumptions for n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. So here, splitting into separate lines for each property makes sense. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those five assumptions (though the last one is the definition of A+B, which might be considered part of the problem statement, but in the example, the definition of A(n) was included in the problem statement. However, in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility, and the assumptions were about n. Here, the definition of A+B is part of the setup, so perhaps it's better to include it as an assumption. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the assumption was n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. The problem statement included the definition of A(n). So perhaps here, the definition of A+B is part of the problem statement. Wait, the original example's problem statement included the expression for A(n). So maybe in this case, the definition of A+B is part of the problem statement. Hmm, the user's example includes:\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nSo the problem statement includes the definition of A(n). Therefore, in the current case, the definition of A+B would be part of the problem statement. Wait, but the original question says \"A+B={a+b | a in A, b in B}\", which is part of the problem's setup. So perhaps in the formatted problem, the problem statement would be \"Prove that sup(A+B) = sup A + sup B where A+B = {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\".\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the assumptions should list all conditions. The problem statement should just state the problem. So in the example, the assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem statement includes the expression for A(n). So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a non-empty set.\n- B is a non-empty set.\n- A is upper bounded.\n- B is upper bounded.\n\nAnd the problem is: Prove that sup(A+B) = sup A + sup B where A+B = {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}.\n\nBut the original question's problem statement already includes \"A+B = {a + b | ...}\". So in the formatted problem, the problem statement should restate that. However, according to the example, the problem statement includes the definition of A(n). So perhaps in this case, the definition of A+B is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7, then the problem statement was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with A(n) defined in the problem. So here, similarly, the problem statement would include the definition of A+B. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a non-empty set.\n- B is a non-empty set.\n- A is upper bounded.\n- B is upper bounded.\n\nProblem: Prove that sup(A+B) = sup A + sup B where A+B = {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The assumptions are the conditions on A and B, and the problem includes the definition of A+B as part of the statement to prove. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a non-empty set,\nB is a non-empty set,\nA is upper bounded,\nB is upper bounded.\n\nProblem: Prove that sup(A+B) = sup A + sup B where A+B = {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}.",
