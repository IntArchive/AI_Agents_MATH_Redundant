    "Content": "Prove the following: The intersection points of any three tangents to a parabola given by the formula $y(y-y_0)=2p(x-x_0)$ are vertices of a triangle whose orthocenter belongs to the directrix of the parabola and the circumcircle of the triangle passes through the focus of the parabola. My attempt: Orthocenter problem part- edited (old notes deleted to be less chaotic and I believe there is still some space for improvement of the first part): In the meantime, I realized it would be better to just use the condition of tangency and plug some of its parameters into the formula for a line in the $xy$ plane. Let $y=k_ix + l_i,\\ i=1,2,3$ be a tangent line to a parabola. Then $$p=2k_il_i\\implies l_i=\\frac{\\frac{p}2}{k_i}$$ Now, our equation becomes: $$\\boxed{y=k_ix+\\frac{\\frac{p}2}{k_i}}$$ We can substitute $\\frac{p}2$ by $\\alpha$ , so $$\\boxed{y=k_ix+\\frac{\\alpha}{k_i}}$$ This way, our computations are getting easier.\nThe equations of the three arbitrary tangents to a parabola are: $$\\begin{aligned}y&=k_1x+\\frac{\\alpha}{k_1}\\\\y&=k_2x+\\frac{\\alpha}{k_2}\\\\y&=k_3x+\\frac{\\alpha}{k_3}\\end{aligned}$$ The intersection point of the $i-$ th and $j-$ th tangent line: $$k_ix+\\frac{\\alpha}{k_i}=k_jx+\\frac{\\alpha}{k_j}\\implies x=\\alpha\\frac{\\frac1{k_j}-\\frac1{k_i}}{k_i-k_j}=\\frac{\\alpha}{k_ik_j}$$ $$y=k_i\\cdot\\frac{\\alpha}{k_ik_j}+\\frac{\\alpha}{k_i}=\\alpha\\left(\\frac1{k_i}+\\frac1{k_j}\\right)$$ $$\\boxed{S_{ij}=\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{k_ik_j},\\alpha\\frac{k_i+k_j}{k_ik_j}\\right)}$$ Now, we have to find the line perpendicular to the $k-$ th tangent line passing through the point $S_{ij}$ . $k_\\perp=-\\frac1{k_k}$ E.g., one altitude of the formed triangle belongs to the line: $$\\begin{aligned}y-y_{S_{1,2}}&=k_\\perp(x-x_{S_{1,2}})\\iff &y&=-\\frac1{k_3}x+\\frac{\\alpha}{k_1k_2k_3}+\\alpha\\left(\\frac1{k_1}+\\frac1{k_2}\\right)\\\\&&y&=-\\frac1{k_3}x+\\alpha\\left(\\frac1{k_1}+\\frac1{k_2}+\\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ So, the $x$ coordinate of the intersection of the three tangent lines: $$\\begin{aligned}y&=-\\frac1{k_3}x+\\alpha\\left(\\frac1{k_1}+\\frac1{k_2}+\\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\\right)\\\\y&=-\\frac1{k_2}x+\\alpha\\left(\\frac1{k_1}+\\frac1{k_3}+\\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\\right)\\\\y&=-\\frac1{k_1}x+\\alpha\\left(\\frac1{k_2}+\\frac1{k_3}+\\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ $$\\begin{aligned}-\\frac1{k_3}x+\\alpha\\left(\\frac1{k_1}+\\frac1{k_2}+\\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\\right)&=-\\frac1{k_2}x+\\alpha\\left(\\frac1{k_1}+\\frac1{k_3}+\\frac1{k_1k_2k_3}\\right)\\\\\\left(\\frac1{k_2}-\\frac1{k_3}\\right)x&=\\left(\\frac1{k_3}-\\frac1{k_2}\\right)\\alpha\\\\x&=-\\alpha=-\\frac{p}2\\end{aligned}$$ End of the first part. The rest remains the same not to be off-topic . Since the points $P_1,P_2, P_3$ are close to the directrix, $\\triangle ABC$ in my picture is obtuse and its orthocenter is outside the triangle, but it doesn't have to be so at all. Let $A,B,C$ be the intersection points of the tangents. $P_2\\in\\overline{AC}$ due to $P_1\\preceq P_2\\preceq P_3$ . Let $A'\\in\\overline{BC}$ s.t. $AA'\\perp BC$ , $B'\\in\\overline{AC}$ s.t. $BB'\\perp AC$ and $C'\\in\\overline{AB}$ s.t. $CC'\\perp AB$ . The center $S$ of the circumscribed circle $q$ of $\\triangle ABC$ is the intersection point of the bisectors $s_1,s_2,s_3$ of the sides $\\overline{AB},\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AC}$ respectively. Furthermore, $\\underline{\\text{each side bisector is parallel to one of the sides of the triangle}}$ , i.e., $$s_1\\parallel\\overline{AA'}\\ \\&\\ s_2\\parallel\\overline{BB'}\\ \\&\\ s_3\\parallel\\overline{CC'} $$ If the orthocenter $T$ is an orthogonal projection of the point $P_2$ onto the directrix $x=-\\frac{p}2$ of the parabola, and if the circumscribed circle $q$ really passes through the focus $$\\boxed{F\\left(\\frac{p}2,0\\right)\\ \\text{or}\\ F\\left(\\frac{p}2+x_0,y_0\\right)}$$ then $|TP_2|=|P_2F|$ . Picture: zoomed: According to the notation in the picture: $$\\begin{aligned}\\measuredangle AA'B&=\\measuredangle A'CT=\\measuredangle BFL\\\\\\measuredangle B'TA&=\\measuredangle ACA'=\\measuredangle AFB\\end{aligned}$$ I can see: $$\\triangle AB'T\\sim\\triangle BB'C\\sim\\triangle A'AC\\sim AFB'$$ In particular: $\\boxed{\\triangle AB'T\\cong\\triangle AFB'\\implies\\ |TB'|=|B'F|\\implies\\triangle TFP_2\\ \\text{is isosceles}\\ \\implies |TP_2|=|P_2F|\\ }$ Also:\nwe can prove the orthogonal projections of the focus onto the three tangents belong to the tangent passing through the vertex of the parabola , meaning those projections are collinear, which, by the Simson theorem , implies the focus belongs to the circumcircle of the triangle. May I ask for advice on solving this task and improve the parts I might have done correctly to be concise as possible? Thank you in advance! P. S. I found a related paper , but almost none of the information has been covered in our official literature. Just in case, I found an answer by @JeanMarie recalling the fact the orthocenter of the observed triangle lies on the directrix of the parabola, but I couldn't think of proof. Update on a special case: I've also read the directrix is the set of all the points in the plane we can draw two mutually perpendicular tangents from (which can be proven via Vieta's formulae and the condition of tangency ). In a right-triangle, the orthocenter is obviously in the vertex opposite to the hypothenuse.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The second request easily follows from this theorem ( see here for a proof ): The exterior angle between any two tangents is equal to the angle\n  which either segment of tangent subtends at the focus. It follows that $\\angle CFP_2=\\angle BCA$ and $\\angle AFP_2=\\angle CAB$ , whence: $$\n\\angle CFA=\\angle BCA+\\angle CAB=\\pi-\\angle ABC.\n$$ Focus $F$ lies then on circle $ABC$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving two properties of a triangle formed by three tangents to a parabola: that the orthocenter lies on the directrix and the circumcircle passes through the focus.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The key elements here are the parabola's equation, the tangents to it, and the properties of the triangle formed by these tangents. The parabola is given by the equation \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\). The problem mentions three tangents, their intersection points forming a triangle. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single condition on one object. So for this problem, the assumptions would include:\n\n1. The parabola is defined by the equation \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n2. Three lines are tangents to this parabola.\n3. The triangle is formed by the intersections of these three tangents.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"any three tangents,\" so maybe the third assumption should be that the three tangents are arbitrary. Also, the directrix and focus are part of the parabola's definition, so maybe another assumption is the standard properties of the parabola (directrix and focus location), but since the equation is given, perhaps the directrix can be derived from it. Let me check the standard form.\n\nThe given equation is \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\). Let me recall that the standard parabola form usually is something like \\( (y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h) \\), which opens to the right with vertex at (h, k). Comparing, if we expand the given equation: \\( y^2 - y y_0 = 2p x - 2p x_0 \\), which can be written as \\( y^2 - y y_0 + (y_0^2/4) = 2p x - 2p x_0 + y_0^2/4 \\), completing the square. Then \\( (y - y_0/2)^2 = 2p(x - x_0) + y_0^2/4 - y_0^2/4 \\), which simplifies to \\( (y - y_0/2)^2 = 2p(x - x_0) \\). So the vertex is at (x_0, y_0/2), and the standard parabola form is \\( Y^2 = 4p' X \\), where here it's \\( Y^2 = 2p X \\), so comparing, 4p' = 2p ⇒ p' = p/2. Therefore, the directrix of this parabola should be at X = -p', which would translate back to original coordinates as x - x_0 = -p/2 ⇒ x = x_0 - p/2. Similarly, the focus is at (X = p', Y = 0) ⇒ (x_0 + p/2, y_0/2).\n\nTherefore, the directrix is the line x = x_0 - p/2, and the focus is at (x_0 + p/2, y_0/2). So these are inherent properties of the given parabola.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is trying to prove that the orthocenter is on the directrix and the circumcircle passes through the focus. So perhaps the assumptions should include the definition of the parabola and that three tangents are considered. However, the problem states \"any three tangents,\" so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The parabola is given by \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n- Three arbitrary tangent lines to the parabola are considered.\n- The intersections of these three tangents form a triangle.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that for any such three tangents, the triangle has orthocenter on directrix and circumcircle through focus. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. The parabola is defined by equation \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n2. Three tangent lines to the parabola are given.\n3. The triangle is formed by the intersections of these three tangent lines.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"any three tangents,\" maybe we can rephrase the assumptions as:\n\n1. Consider a parabola with equation \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n2. Three distinct tangent lines are drawn to the parabola.\n3. The intersections of each pair of tangent lines form the vertices of a triangle.\n\nBut the key is that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me look at the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So each assumption is a separate condition on one object.\n\nIn this case, the first assumption is the definition of the parabola. Then the second is that three tangents are taken. The third is that their intersections form a triangle. However, forming a triangle is a consequence of the three lines not being concurrent, which is generally true for three tangents unless they meet at a single point, but for a parabola, three distinct tangents would form a triangle unless two are parallel. However, in a parabola, all tangents have different slopes (since the axis is vertical, the parabola opens sideways?), Wait, the given equation is \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\). If we rewrite it as \\( (y - y_0/2)^2 = 2p(x - x_0) + (y_0/2)^2 \\), which suggests it's a parabola opening to the right if p is positive. Therefore, its axis is horizontal. Hence, the tangent lines can have various slopes, but they cannot be vertical, but in general, three tangents would form a triangle unless two are parallel. However, the problem says \"any three tangents,\" which might imply they are chosen such that they are not concurrent and not parallel. So perhaps an assumption is that the three tangent lines are non-parallel and non-concurrent. But the original problem doesn't specify that; it just says \"any three tangents.\" Maybe the user assumes that three arbitrary tangents would form a triangle, so perhaps that's implicit. However, in the problem statement, they just mention \"the intersection points of any three tangents to a parabola... are vertices of a triangle.\" So maybe the assumption is that the three tangents are such that their intersections form a triangle, i.e., they are not concurrent. Therefore, one assumption could be:\n\n- The three tangent lines are not concurrent.\n\nBut the problem states \"any three tangents,\" so perhaps the user is considering that three tangents to a parabola are not concurrent, hence forming a triangle. However, in reality, three tangents to a parabola can be concurrent. For example, if you take three points on the parabola such that their tangents meet at a common point (which is the focus, but maybe not). Wait, actually, in a parabola, the tangents from an external point can be two. So three tangents being concurrent would require that there exists a point through which three distinct tangents pass, which for a parabola is not possible because a point outside the parabola can have at most two tangents. Therefore, three distinct tangents to a parabola cannot be concurrent. Hence, their intersections will necessarily form a triangle. Therefore, maybe the assumption is redundant, but to be safe, we can include:\n\n- Three distinct tangent lines to the parabola, which are not concurrent, form a triangle.\n\nBut perhaps it's not necessary. The problem states \"the intersection points of any three tangents... are vertices of a triangle,\" so maybe the problem inherently assumes that. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. The parabola is defined by \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n2. Three distinct tangent lines to the parabola are considered.\n3. The intersections of each pair of tangents form the vertices of a triangle.\n\nBut maybe even more precise. Let's see. The user in their attempt parameterizes the tangents as \\( y = k_i x + \\frac{\\alpha}{k_i} \\), where \\( \\alpha = \\frac{p}{2} \\). So perhaps another assumption is that each tangent line can be written in that form. But that might be part of the problem-solving process, not an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The given parabola equation.\n- The three lines are tangent to the parabola.\n- The triangle is formed by their pairwise intersections.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove two properties about this triangle, the assumptions are the necessary conditions given in the problem statement.\n\nAlso, in the problem statement, the user mentions \"the formula of the parabola \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\)\", so that's the first assumption. Then, three tangents to this parabola, which is the second assumption. The problem then states that the intersections form a triangle, which is a given, so maybe that's a third assumption, but in the example, the assumption was just on n being an integer and divisible by 7, which are conditions on the variable. Here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. The parabola is given by \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n2. Three lines are tangent to the parabola.\n3. The three tangent lines are non-concurrent, forming a triangle.\n\nBut the problem says \"any three tangents,\" so the non-concurrent part is inherent. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require that as an explicit assumption because it's part of the general setup. The example given by the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a condition on the variables involved.\n\nIn the current problem, the main objects are the parabola and the three tangent lines. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The parabola is defined by the equation \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n2. Three distinct lines are tangent to the parabola.\n3. Each pair of tangent lines intersects at a unique point.\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"each pair intersects\" is necessary, because if they are tangent lines to a parabola, they can't be parallel, right? Wait, in a parabola, can two tangents be parallel? For a standard parabola like \\( y^2 = 4ax \\), the slopes of the tangents are \\( m = \\frac{a}{y} \\) for a point (x, y) on the parabola. Wait, no, actually, for the standard parabola, the equation of the tangent at parameter t is \\( ty = x + a t^2 \\), so the slope is \\( 1/t \\). So different t's give different slopes. Therefore, two different tangents will have different slopes unless they are symmetric about the axis. Wait, actually, for a parabola, two distinct tangents can't be parallel because each tangent has a unique slope. Wait, no. For example, consider the parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\). The tangent at point (at^2, 2at) is \\( ty = x + a t^2 \\), which has slope 1/t. So if you take two different t's, say t1 and t2, their slopes are 1/t1 and 1/t2. These can be equal only if t1 = t2, which would be the same tangent line. Therefore, distinct tangents have distinct slopes, so they are not parallel. Hence, any two distinct tangents to a parabola must intersect at a unique point. Therefore, three distinct tangents will form a triangle. Hence, the third assumption is redundant. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The parabola is defined by \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n2. Three distinct tangent lines are drawn to the parabola.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the assumptions are about the parabola and the lines. So the formatted problem's assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe parabola is given by \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\),\nThree distinct lines are tangent to the parabola.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the triangle formed by the intersection points of any three tangents to the parabola has an orthocenter on the directrix and a circumcircle passing through the focus.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states: \"Prove the following: The intersection points of any three tangents to a parabola given by the formula... are vertices of a triangle whose orthocenter belongs to the directrix of the parabola and the circumcircle of the triangle passes through the focus of the parabola.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The parabola is given by \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n2. Three lines are tangent to the parabola.\n3. The intersection points of these three tangents form a triangle.\n\nBut since forming a triangle is guaranteed (as discussed), maybe it's not an assumption but part of the problem statement. However, the example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the equivalent would be the parabola's equation and the three tangents being lines. But the user in their question also derived equations for the tangents as \\( y = k_i x + \\alpha /k_i \\), but that might be part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The parabola equation.\n- The three lines are tangents to the parabola.\n\nSo formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe parabola is defined by the equation \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\),\nThree lines are tangent to the parabola.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the triangle formed by the intersection points of the three tangents has an orthocenter on the directrix and a circumcircle passing through the focus.\n\nBut the original problem says \"any three tangents,\" so perhaps the assumption is that the three tangents are arbitrary.

The parabola is given by \\( y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0) \\).\n2. Three arbitrary tangent lines to the parabola are considered.\n\nHence, formatted as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe parabola is defined by the equation $y(y - y_0) = 2p(x - x_0)$,\nThree arbitrary tangent lines to the parabola are considered.\nProblem:\nProve that the triangle formed by the intersection points of the three tangents has an orthocenter on the directrix of the parabola and a circumcircle passing through the focus of the parabola.\n###",
