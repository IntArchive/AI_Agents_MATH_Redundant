    "Content": "Obviously: $$\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{1}{100}+\\frac{1}{1000}+\\cdots=0.1111\\dots=\\frac{1}{9}$$ is a rational number. Now, if we make terms with demoninators in the form: $$q_n=\\sum_{k=0}^{n} 10^k$$ Then the sum will be: $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{q_n}=\\frac{1}{11}+\\frac{1}{111}+\\frac{1}{1111}+\\cdots=0.1009181908362007\\dots$$ The decimal expansion of this number appears to be non-periodic. How can we prove/disprove that this number is irrational? Edit This number is at OEIS: http://oeis.org/A065444",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original question thoroughly.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether the sum of the series 1/11 + 1/111 + 1/1111 + ... is an irrational number. The user provided an example where a similar series (1/10 + 1/100 + ...) sums to a rational number (1/9), but this one seems to have a non-repeating decimal expansion, suggesting irrationality. The task is to prove or disprove the irrationality of the given series.\n\nNow, following the format: The \"Assumption\" section should list all the assumptions, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Let's parse the problem for assumptions.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: The series is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/q_n, where q_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 10^k. Wait, actually, the denominators q_n are given by summing 10^k from k=0 to n. Let me check that. The user wrote: \"q_n = sum_{k=0}^n 10^k\". So each denominator is 1 + 10 + 10^2 + ... +10^n. That's a number like 11 (1+10), 111 (1+10+100), etc.\n\nSo, for each n ≥1, q_n = (10^{n+1} -1)/9, because the sum of a geometric series. So, for example, when n=1: (10^2 -1)/9 = 99/9 =11, which matches. So the denominators are numbers consisting of n+1 ones in base 10. So each term in the series is 1 divided by a number made of (n+1) ones.\n\nThe problem is to determine if the sum of 1/q_n from n=1 to infinity is irrational.\n\nNow, the original problem doesn't state any explicit assumptions beyond the definition of the series. The user's example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but here, in the problem as given, are there any implicit assumptions?\n\nLooking at the problem again: The denominators q_n are defined as sums of powers of 10 from k=0 to n. So each q_n is a positive integer. The series is an infinite sum of reciprocals of these integers. The question is about the irrationality of the sum. So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. The series is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/q_n.\n2. Each q_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 10^k. (Which can be written as q_n = (10^{n+1} -1)/9.)\n3. The sum is considered as a real number, so convergence is implied.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state any additional conditions, like restrictions on n or convergence. However, since the series is presented as converging (the user mentions the decimal expansion), we can assume convergence is part of the problem's context.\n\nWait, but in the original example given by the user, assumptions were listed as specific conditions on the variables. In this case, the problem is asking about the sum, and the key elements are the definition of q_n and the sum itself. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each integer n ≥1, q_n is defined as the sum from k=0 to n of 10^k.\n- The series sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nSo each of these can be individual assumptions. Since the problem is about proving or disproving the irrationality of the sum, there might not be more explicit assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention any constraints beyond the definition of the series. So the assumptions should capture the setup given in the problem.\n\nAnother point: The problem mentions that the decimal expansion appears non-periodic, but that's an observation, not an assumption. The problem is to prove whether the number is irrational, not assuming it based on the decimal expansion.\n\nThus, the assumptions are:\n\n1. For each integer n ≥1, q_n is defined as the sum from k=0 to n of 10^k.\n2. The series under consideration is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/q_n.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to determine the irrationality of this sum.\n\nWait, but in the user's example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the key points are the definitions of q_n and the series. The problem statement doesn't have any conditions like \"for all n\" other than the series definition. So the Assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each integer n ≥1, q_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption line addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"For each integer n ≥1, q_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k\" could be split into:\n\n- q_n is defined for each integer n ≥1,\n- For each integer n ≥1, q_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k.\n\nBut maybe the first is redundant since the second already states it. Alternatively, perhaps each line is a separate assumption. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\nq_n is defined as ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k for each integer n ≥1,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n converges.\n\nBut the problem doesn't explicitly state that the series converges; it's implied because they're talking about the sum. However, in the example, the user had to include \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the key assumptions are:\n\n- Each term q_n is defined as the sum of 10^k from k=0 to n,\n- The sum is taken over all positive integers n starting from 1.\n\nBut maybe in the original problem's context, the convergence is already established, so we don't need to list it as an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to list the definition of q_n and the series as the assumptions.\n\nSo, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each integer n ≥1, q_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k,\nThe series S = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that S is an irrational number.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about the sum being irrational. So the key elements are the definition of the denominators and the series itself.\n\nSo, the final formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nEach term q_n is defined as ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k for integers n ≥1,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is an irrational number.\n\nBut to split into one condition per line, as per the user's example:\n\nAssumption:\nq_n is defined for each integer n ≥1,\nFor each integer n ≥1, q_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the sum is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, the first two lines can be merged, but according to the example, each assumption should address one property. So each bullet point is one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer greater than or equal to 1,\nq_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that this series is an irrational number.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were:\n\n- $n$ is an integer,\n- $n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSo each assumption line refers to a single condition. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach term q_n is defined for integers n ≥1,\nFor each integer n ≥1, q_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nBut maybe \"Each term q_n is defined for integers n ≥1\" is redundant since the next line defines q_n for those n. However, to adhere to the example's style, where both \"n is an integer\" and \"n divisible by 7\" are separate, perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥1,\nq_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nBut the variable n here is bound in the series, so maybe it's better to state:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each integer n ≥1, q_n = ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k,\nThe series S = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nBut each assumption line must address only one property. So the first line is the definition of q_n for each n, and the second line is the consideration of the series. However, the user's example used two lines for assumptions about n. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nq_n is defined as ∑_{k=0}^n 10^k for integers n ≥1,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/q_n is considered.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The first defines the denominators, the second defines the series. So this should be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nq_n is defined as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} 10^k$ for integers $n \\geq 1$,\nThe series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{q_n}$ is considered.\nProblem: \nProve or disprove that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{q_n}$ is an irrational number.\n###",
