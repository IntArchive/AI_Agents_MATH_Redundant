    "Content": "Problem. Let $f: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ be a monotone increasing function. Show that $f$ is measurable. Solution. We know that the set of discontinuites of any monotone increasing function $f$ is measure zero (since it is at most countable). We define a continuous function $g$ such that $g(x)=f(x)$ except the discontinuous points of $g$. Then $g(x)=f(x)$ almost everywhere. Note that any continuous function $g: \\mathbf{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ is measurable. Also note that if $g$ is measurable and $f=g$ almost everywhere, then $f$ is measurable. Hence we conclude that $f$ is measurable. Is my solution correct? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is true that $f$ is continuous almost everywhere, but it is not true that there exists a continuous function $g:\\mathbb R\\to\\mathbb R$ such that $f=g$ almost everywhere, unless $f$ is already continuous, as Jacob said in a comment.  Note that the left-hand and right-hand limits of $f$ exist everywhere, and if they are not equal for $f$, then they cannot be equal for any function equal to $f$ almost everywhere.  E.g., the characteristic function of $[0,\\infty)$ is monotone and not equal almost everywhere to a continuous function. (The characteristic function of the rationals is equal almost everywhere to a continuous function, but is continuous nowhere.  This shows from the other direction why \"continuous almost everywhere\" and \"equal almost everywhere to a continuous function\" are very different.) Modifying your work to something correct takes more effort than the simpler and clearer solution given by Cass.  Let $D$ be the set of discontinuities of $f$.  Then $D$ is countable, hence of measure $0$.  The restriction $f|_D$ is measurable on $D$ because every subset of $D$ is measurable, and the restriction $f|_{\\mathbf R\\setminus D}$ is measurable on $\\mathbf R\\setminus D$ because it is continuous.  You can show this implies that $f$ is measurable.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question on Math Stack Exchange.\n\nThe title of the question is: \"$f: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ monotone increasing $\\Rightarrow$ $f$ is measurable\". The user is asking whether their solution is correct. Their solution involves using the fact that the set of discontinuities of a monotone increasing function is measure zero, defining a continuous function $g$ equal to $f$ except at those points, and then arguing that since $g$ is measurable and $f$ equals $g$ almost everywhere, $f$ must be measurable.\n\nBut I need to focus on structuring the problem, not the solution. The original problem is to show that a monotone increasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is measurable.\n\nAssumptions: The key assumptions here are about the properties of the function $f$. The first assumption is that $f$ is a function from the real numbers to the real numbers. The second is that $f$ is monotone increasing. These are the two main conditions given in the problem statement. The user's solution mentions the set of discontinuities being measure zero, but that's part of their reasoning, not an assumption given in the problem. The problem itself doesn't state anything else, like specific continuity conditions or anything about the measure; those are part of the solution approach.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each property of the function $f$ as separate points. Each line should address one property applied to one object. In this case, the object is the function $f$, and its properties are being a function from R to R and being monotone increasing.\n\nProblem: The problem is to show that $f$ is measurable. So the problem statement is straightforward once the assumptions are laid out.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any parts of the user's solution in the assumptions. The problem is only about the function being monotone increasing and mapping R to R, and the task is to prove measurability. The user's mention of discontinuities being measure zero is part of their proof strategy, not part of the problem's given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have two assumptions: one about the domain and codomain of $f$, and another about its monotonicity. The problem is to prove that under these conditions, $f$ is measurable.",
