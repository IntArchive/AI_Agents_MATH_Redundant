    "Content": "I'm 16 years old, and I'm studying for my exam maths coming this monday. In the chapter \"sequences and series\", there is this exercise: Prove that a positive integer formed by $k$ times digit 1, followed by $(k-1)$\n  times digit 5 and ending on one 6, is the square of an integer. I'm not a native English speaker, so my translation of the exercise might be a bit crappy. What is says is that 16, 1156, 111556, 11115556, 1111155556, etc are all squares of integers. I'm supposed to prove that. I think my main problem is that I don't see the link between these numbers and sequences. Of course, we assume we use a decimal numeral system (= base 10) Can anyone point me in the right direction (or simply prove it, if it is difficult to give a hint without giving the whole evidence). I think it can't be that difficult, since I'm supposed to solve it. For sure, by using the word \"integer\", I mean \"natural number\"  ($\\in\\mathbb{N}$) Thanks in advance. As TMM pointed out, the square roots are 4, 34, 334, 3334, 33334, etc... This row is given by one of the following descriptions: $t_n = t_{n-1} + 3*10^{n-1}$ $t_n = \\lfloor\\frac{1}{3}*10^{n}\\rfloor + 1$ $t_n = t_{n-1} * 10 - 6$ But, I still don't see any progress in my evidence. A human being can see in these numbers a system and can tell it will be correct for $k$ going to $\\infty$. But this isn't enough for a mathematical evidence.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Mark Bennet already suggested looking at the numbers as geometric series, so I'll use a slightly different approach. Instead of writing the squares like that, try writing them as follows: $$\\begin{align} 15&.999\\ldots = 16 \\\\ 1155&.999\\ldots = 1156 \\\\ 111555&.999\\ldots = 111556 \\\\  \\vdots\\end{align}$$ These numbers can be expressed as a sum of three numbers, as follows: $$\\begin{align} 111111&.111\\ldots \\\\ 444&.444\\ldots \\\\ 0&.444\\ldots \\\\ \\hline 111555&.999\\ldots \\end{align}$$ Since $1/9 = 0.111\\ldots$, we get $$\\begin{align} 111111&.111\\ldots = \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot 10^{2k} \\\\ 444&.444\\ldots = \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^k \\\\ 0&.444\\ldots = \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot 4 \\\\ \\hline 111555&.999\\ldots = \\frac{1}{9} \\left(10^{2k} + 4 \\cdot 10^k + 4\\right). \\end{align}$$ But this can be written as a square: $$\\frac{1}{9} \\left(10^{2k} + 4 \\cdot 10^k + 4\\right) = \\left(\\frac{10^k + 2}{3}\\right)^2.$$ Since $10^k + 2$ is always divisible by $3$, this is indeed the square of an integer.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original question is about proving that numbers formed by k ones, (k-1) fives, and ending with a six are perfect squares. The example given is 16, 1156, 111556, etc., which are squares of 4, 34, 334, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions a positive integer formed by k times digit 1, followed by (k-1) times digit 5, and ending with one 6. The user also mentions the decimal system. The problem is to prove that such numbers are squares.\n\nLooking at the example provided in the instructions, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption 1: The number is a positive integer. (Since the user mentions \"natural number\" in the problem statement.)\nAssumption 2: The number is formed by k occurrences of the digit 1. (This applies to the first part of the number.)\nAssumption 3: The number is followed by (k-1) occurrences of the digit 5. (Second part.)\nAssumption 4: The number ends with the digit 6. (Final part.)\nAssumption 5: The numeral system is decimal (base 10). (Explicitly stated in the original problem.)\n\nWait, the original problem states \"we assume we use a decimal numeral system\", so that's another assumption. Each assumption should be a separate line. Let me list them:\n\n- The number is a positive integer (natural number).\n- The number is formed by k digits of 1.\n- The number is followed by (k-1) digits of 5.\n- The number ends with one digit 6.\n- The numeral system is decimal (base 10).\n\nBut the problem statement should be concise. The original problem is to prove that such numbers are squares of integers. The user's translation mentions \"a positive integer formed by k times digit 1, followed by (k-1) times digit 5 and ending on one 6\" is a square.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have those assumptions and the problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7, then the problem statement. Here, the key is to list all necessary conditions given in the problem.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"for any k\", so maybe the assumption should include that k is a positive integer. However, the problem as presented in the question doesn't explicitly state k as a variable, but in the problem description, it's implied. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question says: \"Prove that a positive integer formed by $k$ times digit 1, followed by $(k-1)$ times digit 5 and ending on one 6, is the square of an integer.\"\n\nSo here, k is part of the problem's condition. So the assumptions should include that k is a positive integer. Let me adjust:\n\nAssumption 1: k is a positive integer.\nAssumption 2: The number is formed by k consecutive digits of 1.\nAssumption 3: The number is followed by (k-1) consecutive digits of 5.\nAssumption 4: The number ends with a single digit 6.\nAssumption 5: The numeral system is decimal (base 10).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"ending on one 6\", so perhaps the number ends with exactly one 6. So each of those parts: k 1s, then (k-1) 5s, then one 6. So the structure is 1...1 (k times) followed by 5...5 (k-1 times) followed by 6. So that's the number's digit composition.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- The number is formed by k digits of 1.\n- The number is followed by (k - 1) digits of 5.\n- The number ends with a single digit 6.\n- The numeral system is decimal (base 10).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each addressing one property applied to one object. The problem is to prove that such a number is the square of an integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
