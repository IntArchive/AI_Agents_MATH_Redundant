    "Content": "Suppose that an entire function $f(z)$ satisfies $\\left|f(z)\\right|\\leq k\\left|z\\right|^n$ for sufficiently large $\\left|z\\right|$, where $n\\in\\mathbb{Z^+}$ and $k>0$ is constant. Show that $f$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $f$ is entire, it is equal to a power series centered at zero with radius of convergence $\\infty$, which must match its Taylor series there. $$f(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}z^n$$ Since $|f(z)|\\leq k|z|^m$, Cauchy's estimate gives $$|f^{(n)}(0)|\\leq \\frac{n!k|z|^m}{R^n}$$\nfor all $|z|=R$. For $n>m$, letting $R\\rightarrow\\infty$, we see that $|f^{(n)}|=0$. It follows that $f$ is a polynomial of degree $\\leq m$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the problem states that if an entire function f(z) satisfies |f(z)| ≤ k|z|^n for sufficiently large |z|, where n is a positive integer and k is a positive constant, then f must be a polynomial of degree at most n. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what an entire function is. An entire function is a function that's holomorphic everywhere on the complex plane. Examples include polynomials, exponential functions, sine, cosine, etc. Now, the key thing here is that the function is bounded by a polynomial of degree n for large |z|. The question is to show that under this condition, the entire function must itself be a polynomial of degree at most n.\n\nI remember that there's a theorem related to entire functions bounded by polynomials. Isn't it Liouville's theorem? Wait, Liouville's theorem states that if an entire function is bounded (i.e., |f(z)| ≤ M for some constant M for all z), then f must be constant. But this is a more general case where the bound is a polynomial instead of a constant. So maybe there's a generalization of Liouville's theorem here.\n\nAnother thing that comes to mind is the Taylor series expansion of entire functions. Since f is entire, it can be expressed as a power series expansion around 0 (or any point, but let's take 0 for simplicity) that converges everywhere in the complex plane. So, f(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ a_k z^k. The coefficients a_k can be given by Cauchy's integral formula: a_k = f^{(k)}(0)/k! = (1/(2πi)) ∫_{C_R} f(z)/z^{k+1} dz, where C_R is a circle of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nNow, if we can show that all coefficients a_k for k > n are zero, then f would be a polynomial of degree at most n. That seems like a plan. So, how can we use the given inequality |f(z)| ≤ k|z|^n for |z| sufficiently large to show that a_k = 0 when k > n?\n\nUsing the Cauchy estimate for the coefficients. The Cauchy estimate says that |a_k| ≤ (1/(2π)) * max_{|z|=R} |f(z)| / R^{k} * 2πR. Simplifying, this becomes |a_k| ≤ max_{|z|=R} |f(z)| / R^k. \n\nGiven the condition, for sufficiently large R, |f(z)| ≤ k R^n when |z| = R (since |z| = R, so |z|^n = R^n). Therefore, substituting into the Cauchy estimate, we get |a_k| ≤ (k R^n) / R^k = k / R^{k - n}.\n\nNow, if k > n, then k - n is a positive integer. Therefore, as R approaches infinity, R^{k - n} becomes very large, so the right-hand side k / R^{k - n} approaches zero. But the left-hand side |a_k| is a constant that doesn't depend on R. The only way this inequality can hold for all sufficiently large R is if |a_k| = 0. Hence, a_k = 0 for all k > n.\n\nTherefore, all coefficients beyond degree n are zero, which implies that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most n. That seems to be the solution. Let me check if I missed anything. The key steps are: entire function has power series expansion, apply Cauchy estimates using the given bound, take the limit as R approaches infinity to force the coefficients to be zero beyond degree n. Yep, that should do it.",
