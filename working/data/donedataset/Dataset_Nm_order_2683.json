    "Content": "Prove that a countable subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ has Lebesgue outer measure zero. I believe I am on the right track but can use some help with this one. Here is my proof thus far: Let $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then, $\\{a\\} \\subset [a-\\epsilon, a+\\epsilon]$ holds $\\forall \\epsilon>0$ and so $\\lambda^*(\\{a\\}) \\le \\lambda^*([a-\\epsilon, a+\\epsilon])=2\\epsilon \\; \\forall \\epsilon >0$. Therefore, $\\lambda^*(\\{a\\})=0$ holds $\\forall a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If $A = \\{ a_1, a_2,... \\} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{a_n\\}$ is a countable set, then note that $\\lambda^*(A) \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^*(\\{a_n\\})=0$ so that $\\lambda^*(A)=0$. Is this along the right lines?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can use the basic definition of Lebesgue outer measure.  Let $\\epsilon>0$.  Assume for simplicity that $R$ is countably infinite, with $R=\\{r_1, r_2, r_3, \\ldots\\}$.  For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}^+$, find an interval (you can use either closed or open) with length $\\epsilon/2^n$ containing $r_n$. What's the sum of the lengths of all the intervals?  What can you conclude from this? To answer your question more directly, your proof is correct.  You proved correctly that the Lebesgue outer measure of any point is zero.  You used the countable subadditivity property of Lebesgue outer measure correctly.  The word \"subadditivity\" is used with sets (not necessarily Lebesgue measurable) that are not necessarily disjoint, and \"additivity\" is used with disjoint sets. If you have a countable, disjoint collection of Lebesgue measurable sets, then its union is Lebesgue measurable, and the Lebesgue outer measure of the union (also called its \"Lebesgue measure\" for short) is the sum of the Lebesgue measures of the sets in the collection.  It is true that any countable set, which includes any finite set or singleton, is Lebesgue measurable.  However, the question doesn't appear to ask anything about whether a countable set is measurable.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that a countable subset of the real numbers has Lebesgue outer measure zero. From what I remember, the Lebesgue outer measure is defined as the infimum of the sum of the lengths of open interval covers of the set. \n\nThe user's approach starts by considering a single point {a}, covering it with an interval [a - ε, a + ε], which has length 2ε. Since ε can be as small as we like, the outer measure of {a} must be zero. Then, since a countable set A is the union of all these singletons {a_n}, they use subadditivity of the outer measure to sum up the measures of each singleton, which are all zero, hence the total outer measure should be zero. \n\nWait, but let me check the assumptions here. The key points seem to be:\n\n1. The set A is countable, which means it can be listed as a sequence {a_1, a_2, ...}.\n2. The Lebesgue outer measure is countably subadditive, so the outer measure of the union is less than or equal to the sum of the outer measures of each individual set.\n3. Each singleton {a_n} has outer measure zero, which is established by covering each point with an interval of arbitrarily small length.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is to prove that any countable subset of R has Lebesgue outer measure zero. The user's proof seems to be correct. However, maybe there's a need to verify if all the properties used are indeed valid. For example, countable subadditivity is a property of outer measure, so that's a valid step. Also, covering each singleton with an interval of length 2ε and taking ε approaching zero gives measure zero for each singleton.\n\nSo in terms of structuring the problem according to the required format, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a countable subset of R.\n- Each singleton set {a_n} has Lebesgue outer measure zero.\n- Lebesgue outer measure is countably subadditive.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that any countable subset has measure zero. The assumptions should be the given conditions, not the properties used in the proof. The user's problem doesn't state any specific conditions beyond A being countable. So the only assumption here is that A is a countable subset of R. The rest are properties of the Lebesgue outer measure that are used in the proof, not assumptions of the problem.\n\nTherefore, when formatting according to the example, the Assumption should list the conditions given in the problem. The original problem doesn't mention any specific constraints on the elements of A other than being countable. So the assumption is simply that A is a countable subset of R. The problem then is to prove that such a set has Lebesgue outer measure zero.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it was \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe there was a miscommunication in the example. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be that n is an integer, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. That might be an error. Therefore, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but they want us to follow that structure.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is to prove that a countable subset of R has Lebesgue outer measure zero. The user's own proof attempt uses the fact that each singleton has measure zero and countable subadditivity. But the problem itself doesn't have any hidden assumptions; the only assumption is that the set is countable. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption should be \"A is a countable subset of R\".\n\nHence, following the structure:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a countable subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A has Lebesgue outer measure zero.\n\nBut wait, the user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original example was:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless there was a typo in the original problem. Wait, maybe the original problem had n divisible by 7, but the example here might have a mistake. Anyway, perhaps the user wants to list all the conditions applied to the objects in the problem. In the current problem, the only condition is that A is countable. Therefore, the assumption should just be that.",
