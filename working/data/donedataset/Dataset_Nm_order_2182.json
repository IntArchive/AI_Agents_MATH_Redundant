    "Content": "To motivate my question, recall the following well-known fact: Suppose that $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$ is a prime number. Then the equation $x^2\\equiv -1\\pmod p$ has a solution. One can show this as follows: Consider the following polynomial in ${\\mathbb Z}_p[x]$: $x^{4k}-1$, where $p=4k+1$. The roots of this polynomial are precisely the elements of ${\\mathbb Z}_p^*$, each one with multiplicity 1. The polynomial factors as $(x^{2k}-1)((x^k)^2+1)$, and it follows that if $a$ is any element of ${\\mathbb Z}_p^*$ with $a^{2k}\\ne 1$ (and there are precisely $(p-1)/2$ possible such $a$), then $b=a^k$ satisfies $b^2\\equiv -1\\pmod p$. Of course, there are other arguments, but I am interested in pursuing this line of reasoning. My question is the following: From the quadratic reciprocity law, we\n  have that $x^2\\equiv -2\\pmod p$ has a\n  solution iff $p\\equiv 1$ or $3\\pmod\n  8$. Is there a proof of the\n  right-to-left implication using some\n  polynomial and appropriate counting of\n  roots, as in the case shown above?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $p=8k+1$ then consider $a$ with $a^{4k}\\equiv-1$ (mod $p$).\nLet $b=a^k-a^{7k}$. Then\n$$b^2=a^{2k}-2a^{8k}+a^{14k}\\equiv a^{2k}(1+a^{4k})-2\n\\equiv-2\\pmod{p}.$$\nFor $p\\equiv3$ (mod $8$) this argument will also work but you need to use the\nGalois field $GF(p^2)$ rather than the integers modulo $p$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving the right-to-left implication of the statement that the equation \\( x^2 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution if and only if \\( p \\equiv 1 \\) or \\( 3 \\pmod{8} \\). The user wants a proof similar to the one shown for \\( x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\) when \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), which uses polynomial factorization and root counting.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The original problem mentions quadratic reciprocity, but the user is specifically asking about an alternative proof using polynomials and root counting. The example given for \\( x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\) assumes that \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), which is a prime. Similarly, here, the right-to-left implication is when \\( p \\equiv 1 \\) or \\( 3 \\pmod{8} \\), so the prime \\( p \\) should satisfy this condition.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include that \\( p \\) is a prime, and \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\) or \\( p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8} \\). Wait, but in the original problem statement, it's an \"iff\", and the user is focusing on the right-to-left direction. So the assumption is that \\( p \\equiv 1 \\) or \\( 3 \\pmod{8} \\), and \\( p \\) is a prime. The problem is to prove that under these conditions, \\( x^2 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is on a separate line. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Each applies to one object (n). Here, the prime p has two congruence conditions. But since p can be either 1 or 3 mod 8, should these be two separate assumptions? The problem is asking for when p is 1 or 3 mod 8, so maybe it's one assumption stating that p is a prime congruent to 1 or 3 mod 8. Alternatively, each congruence could be a separate assumption, but since they are part of the same condition, perhaps combining them is better. However, the example splits into separate lines for each condition, even if they apply to the same object. Wait, in the example, the original problem had n being an integer, and the formatted problem had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each condition is a separate line. \n\nTherefore, here, the assumptions should be: p is a prime, p ≡ 1 mod 8 or p ≡ 3 mod 8. Wait, but the way to split them. Since p is a prime, that's one assumption. Then the congruence is another. However, the congruence is two possibilities. The original example had n is an integer (one line), n is divisible by 7 (another line). Here, maybe \"p ≡ 1 mod 8\" and \"p ≡ 3 mod 8\" as two separate assumptions? But that might be redundant. Alternatively, state that p is a prime and p ≡ 1 or 3 mod 8 as two separate lines. But \"p ≡ 1 or 3 mod 8\" is a single condition. However, the problem's assumption is that p is 1 or 3 mod 8. So maybe split into two lines: p is a prime, p ≡ 1 mod 8 or p ≡ 3 mod 8. But in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though they are two separate conditions. So here, similar approach: first, p is a prime, second, p ≡ 1 mod 8 or p ≡ 3 mod 8. But the problem is about the implication where p is 1 or 3 mod 8. So the two assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime,\np ≡ 1 mod 8 or p ≡ 3 mod 8.\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation \\( x^2 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution.\n\nWait, the user's question is specifically asking for the right-to-left implication. That is, if p ≡1 or 3 mod 8, then the equation has a solution. So the problem is to prove that under these conditions, there exists a solution. So the assumptions are p is a prime, and p ≡1 or 3 mod 8. So that's two separate assumptions. Each one in a line. So:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime,\np ≡ 1 mod 8 or p ≡ 3 mod 8.\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation \\( x^2 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution.\n\nBut the user also mentioned quadratic reciprocity, but wants a proof using polynomial factorization and root counting, similar to the example given. So maybe the problem is structured correctly as above. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question: From the quadratic reciprocity law, we have that \\( x^2 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution iff \\( p \\equiv 1 \\) or \\( 3 \\pmod{8} \\). Is there a proof of the right-to-left implication using some polynomial and appropriate counting of roots, as in the case shown above?\n\nSo the task is to structure the problem as per the format. The user's problem is to prove the right-to-left direction (if p ≡1 or 3 mod8, then solution exists) using polynomial methods. So the assumptions are p is prime, and p ≡1 or 3 mod8. The problem is to show x² ≡-2 mod p has a solution.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime,\np ≡ 1 mod 8 or p ≡ 3 mod 8.\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation \\( x^2 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is on its own line, applying to one object (p). The first line states p is prime, the second line states the congruence condition. The problem is to prove existence of solution. That matches the example given where assumptions were on separate lines.",
