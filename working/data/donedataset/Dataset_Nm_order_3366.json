    "Content": "I have been using this rule to determine whether a number is a prime number, but not how to prove it. Why it has to be $\\sqrt{a}$? If $a$ is not divisible by all the prime numbers less than or equal to $\\sqrt{a}$, then $a$ is a prime number.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume $a$ is not a prime number. Then it can be written as $a = bc$ with $b, c \\ge 2$. Then the smaller of $b, c$ is less than or equal to $\\sqrt a$, for otherwise the product would be greater than $\\sqrt a \\, \\sqrt a = a$. This smaller factor is then either a prime itself or has a prime factor that is even smaller.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking why, when checking if a number a is prime, we only need to check divisibility by primes less than or equal to the square root of a. Hmm, I remember something about factors coming in pairs. Let me think.\n\nSuppose a is a composite number. That means it has factors other than 1 and itself. Let's say a = b * c, where both b and c are greater than 1. Now, if both b and c were greater than sqrt(a), then their product would be greater than a, right? Because if b > sqrt(a) and c > sqrt(a), then b*c > sqrt(a)*sqrt(a) = a. That's a contradiction because b*c should equal a. So at least one of the factors must be less than or equal to sqrt(a).\n\nTherefore, if a has a factor other than 1 and itself, it must have a factor less than or equal to sqrt(a). But wait, that factor could be composite. However, if there's a composite factor, then it would have prime factors itself. So instead of checking all numbers up to sqrt(a), we just need to check primes up to sqrt(a), because any composite number would have a prime factor less than or equal to its square root.\n\nSo the key points are:\n1. If a is composite, it has a factor ≤ sqrt(a).\n2. That factor must be prime, or else it would have smaller prime factors.\n3. Therefore, testing primes up to sqrt(a) suffices.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like when a is a perfect square. For example, if a = 25, sqrt(a) = 5, and 5 is a prime factor. So even if the factor is exactly sqrt(a), it's included in the check.\n\nPutting this all together, the assumption is that we check primes up to sqrt(a), and if none divide a, then a must be prime. The proof relies on the properties of factors and primes in composite numbers.",
