Let $G$ be a non-empty set, $d$ a distance on $G$ and $\\cdot$ an associative operation on $G$ $\\cdot$ is such that $$\\forall a \\in G , \\forall x \\in G ,\\forall y \\in G,( a\\cdot x =a \\cdot y) \\Rightarrow x=y $$ and $$\\forall a \\in G , \\forall x \\in G ,\\forall y \\in G, (x\\cdot a =y \\cdot a) \\Rightarrow x=y $$ $ \\cdot$ is continuous $(G,d)$ is compact Prove that $(G,\\cdot)$ is a group, and that the inverse function ($x \\rightarrow x^{-1}$) is continuous What I need to find first is an identity element. My guess is that I should consider the minimum $m$ of the function  $f_x:y \\rightarrow d(x\\cdot y,x) $ (which exists since $f_x$ has a compact domain, and its codomain is $\\mathbb R$). I don't know how to prove that $m=0$ though...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The fact this $G$ is a group is a theorem of Katsumi Nakamura\nin his paper \" On bicompact semigroups \", Mathematical Journal of Okayama\nUniversity, 1952, see theorem 1. The proof is not hard but a bit long. To prove that the inverse is continuous, suppose it is not. Since our group is metrizable, it suffices to work with limits of sequences (even if it were not metrizable, one can run a similar argument using nets instead). Then there exists $x\\in G$ and a sequence $x_i$ converging to $x$ so that $x^{-1}\\ne y=\\lim_{i} x_i^{-1}$. Note that since $G$ is compact, by working with subsequences, it suffices to consider the case when the sequence $(x_i^{-1})$ converges to some $y\\in G$ and $y\\ne x^{-1}$. We then have, by continuity of multiplication, that: \n$$\nyx= \\lim_{i} (x_i^{-1} x)= \\lim_i 1= 1. \n$$ \nFor the same reason, $xy=1$. Thus, $y=x^{-1}$, which is a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then clearly state the problem. Let me go through the original question step by step.\n\nThe title is \"Proving that a metric space is a group.\" The question mentions a non-empty set G with a distance d and an associative operation ⋅. The operation has the properties of left and right cancellation: if a⋅x = a⋅y then x=y, and similarly for the right side. Additionally, ⋅ is continuous, and (G,d) is compact. The goal is to prove two things: (G,⋅) is a group and the inverse function is continuous.\n\nFirst, listing the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. G is a non-empty set.\n2. d is a metric (distance) on G.\n3. The operation ⋅ is associative on G.\n4. For all a, x, y in G, if a⋅x = a⋅y, then x=y (left cancellation).\n5. For all a, x, y in G, if x⋅a = y⋅a, then x=y (right cancellation).\n6. The operation ⋅ is continuous with respect to the metric d.\n7. The metric space (G,d) is compact.\n\nThese are the key assumptions. The problem then asks to prove two things: that (G,⋅) is a group and that the inverse function is continuous. However, in the example provided, the problem part was a single statement to prove. The user's example included the divisibility by 91, which was the main goal. Here, the original question has two parts: proving G is a group and the continuity of the inverse. But the user's example combined similar goals into one problem statement. So maybe we should present both parts as the problem to solve.\n\nWait, the example had the Assumptions and then the Problem. In this case, the problem is to prove two things. The user might want both in the problem statement. Let me check the example again. The example's problem was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem should state both objectives. The user might need to combine them into one problem statement or separate them. Since the original question mentions both, I'll include both in the problem part.\n\nNow, the assumptions. Let's list each one by one. The first is that G is non-empty. Then d is a distance on G. The operation is associative. Then left cancellation, right cancellation, continuity of the operation, and compactness of G under d. Each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property of one object. For example, the left and right cancellation are separate properties, each applied to the operation ⋅. The continuity of ⋅ is another assumption. The compactness of (G,d) is another. So all seven points I listed earlier are correct.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that (G,⋅) is a group and that the inverse function is continuous. So combining these two into the problem line. The original question also mentions that the user is trying to find an identity element first by considering the minimum of some function f_x, but that's part of their attempt, which we don't include in the formatted problem. Only the problem as posed by the user should be structured.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have all the assumptions listed line by line and then the problem as stated. Let me verify if I missed any assumptions. The original problem says \"⋅ is such that\" followed by cancellation properties. So those are conditions on the operation. The operation is also associative. Then continuity of ⋅, compactness of (G,d). That's all. The problem is to prove G is a group (which requires identity element and inverses) and continuity of the inverse.\n\nYes, that's all. So the final answer should have the seven assumptions and the problem statement as proving the two parts.",
