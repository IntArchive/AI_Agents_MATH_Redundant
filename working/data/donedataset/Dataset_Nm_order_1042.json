    "Content": "Let $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to (0,\\infty)$ be a differentiable function satisfying \n$$f(f(x))=f^\\prime(x)$$for each $x$. Show no such function exists. I got this problem in an exam. I haven't done anything significant with it. I have found that $f^\\prime=f\\circ f>0$ so $f(f(x))>f(0)$ hence we have $f^\\prime(x)>f(0)$. But I have no idea how to use it. I tried to apply the mean value theorem on $$\\frac{f(f(x))-f(0)}{f(x)}=f^\\prime(c)=\\frac{f^\\prime(x)-f(0)}{f(x)}$$ but that doesn't lead anywhere. Can someone help me? Thanks a lot.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As you say, if there is such an $f$, then $f'(x) > f(0) > 0$ for all $x$. We can now use that lower bound on the derivative to show that $f$ must be negative for sufficiently large, negative $x$: Let $x < 0$. Then by the MVT, there exists a $c \\in (x, 0)$ such that \n$$\\frac{f(0) - f(x)}{-x} = f'(c) > f(0)$$ Hence $f(0) - f(x) > f(0)(-x) \\ \\ \\ $ or $ \\ \\ \\ \\ f(x) - f(0) < f(0)x$. Thus for $x < -1$, $$f(x) < (x+1)f(0) < 0$$\ncontradicting the hypothesis that $f(x)$ is always positive.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement should then follow.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The user is asking to show that no function f exists which is differentiable from the reals to positive real numbers, satisfying f(f(x)) = f'(x) for each x. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The function f has domain ℝ and codomain (0, ∞), so that's two separate assumptions: one about the domain and one about the codomain. Then, it's differentiable. Next, the functional equation f(f(x)) = f'(x) for all x. Each of these should be a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nWait, the example given had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f: ℝ → (0, ∞) (so domain and codomain)\n2. f is differentiable\n3. For all x ∈ ℝ, f(f(x)) = f’(x)\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the example combines the function's definition and the condition. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the problem here, the function's properties are part of the problem's conditions.\n\nWait, maybe in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a function from ℝ to (0, ∞)\n- f is differentiable\n- For every real x, f(f(x)) equals f’(x)\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. So each is a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nBut wait, the example splits \"for every integer n\" into an assumption. But here, the problem is about the existence of such a function, so the assumptions are the conditions that the function must satisfy. So each of those properties (domain, codomain, differentiable, functional equation) are the assumptions given in the problem.\n\nSo putting that together, the formatted problem should have the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from ℝ to (0, ∞),\nf is differentiable,\nfor every real x, f(f(x)) = f’(x).\n\nProblem:\nShow no such function exists.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem statement includes the divisibility condition again. Let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in that example, the problem as stated includes \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps there was a mistake here, but the user might have intended that. However, in the current problem, the problem is to show that no such function exists under the given assumptions. So the assumptions are all the conditions on f. Therefore, the problem is to show that there's no function f meeting those assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℝ → (0, ∞),\nf is differentiable,\nfor each x ∈ ℝ, f(f(x)) = f’(x).\n\nProblem:\nShow no such function exists.\n\nI think that's right. Let me check again. Each assumption line addresses one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the first line is the domain and codomain of f. The second line is differentiability. The third line is the functional equation. Each is separate, so that should be correct.",
