    "Content": "It's often said that there are only two nonabelian groups of order 8 up to isomorphism, one is the quaternion group, the other given by the relations $a^4=1$, $b^2=1$ and $bab^{-1}=a^3$. I've never understood why these are the only two. Is there a reference or proof walkthrough on how to show any nonabelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to one of these?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A very down-to-Earth approach might be: Let $G$ be a group of order 8. Exercise 1: Show that the maximal order $m$ of an element $x$ of $G$ is either 2, 4, or 8. Exercise 2: Show that if $m=2$, then the group $G$ is abelian. Exercise 3: Show that if $m=8$, then the group $G$ is abelian. Ok, so that leaves us with the case $m=4$. Let $x$ be an element of order 4. Let $H\\simeq C_4$ be the subgroup generated by $x$. Exercise 4: Show that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Let $y\\in G, y\\notin H$ be a fixed element. Exercise 5: Show that $y^2\\in H$. Exercise 6: Show that $yxy^{-1}$ is an element of order 4 in $H$. Exercise 7: Show that either $yxy^{-1}=x$ or $yxy^{-1}=x^3$. Exercise 8: Show that if $yxy^{-1}=x$, then $G$ is abelian. Ok, so we must have $yxy^{-1}=x^3.$ Assume that this is the case in what follows. Exercise 9: Show that if $y$ is of order 2, then $G$ is isomorphic to a dihedral group. Exercise 10: Show that if $y$ is of order 4, then $y^2=x^2$. Exercise 11: Show that if $y$ is of order 4, then $G$ is isomorphic to the quaternion group (or more precisely: the group of units of the Lipschitz' order) Rejoice! Remark: You won't need the result of Exercise 5 until the two last ones. I just added it there, because the element $y$ was introduced at that point.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that there are only two nonabelian groups of order 8 up to isomorphism. The two groups mentioned are the quaternion group and the dihedral group of order 8 (which is the one with the relations a⁴=1, b²=1, and bab⁻¹=a³). \n\nFirst, I need to recall some group theory basics. The order of a group is the number of its elements. For groups of order 8, the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups tells us that the abelian ones are the cyclic group of order 8, the direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and one of order 2, and the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2. But the question is about nonabelian groups.\n\nSo, nonabelian groups of order 8. Let's think about the possible structures. Since the group is nonabelian, it can't be cyclic, so all elements can't have order dividing 8 commutatively. The possible element orders in such groups would be factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8. But since it's nonabelian, there must be elements that don't commute.\n\nThe quaternion group Q8 has elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} with specific multiplication rules. The dihedral group D4 (symmetries of a square) has rotations and reflections. Both are nonabelian of order 8. The question is why these are the only ones.\n\nTo approach this, let's consider the classification of groups of order 8. For nonabelian groups, we can use the following reasoning:\n\n1. If all elements have order 2, the group would be abelian (since every element is self-inverse, so the group is elementary abelian, but order 8 would mean it's isomorphic to C2×C2×C2, which is abelian). Hence, a nonabelian group of order 8 must have at least one element of order 4.\n\n2. Let G be a nonabelian group of order 8. Then, it must have an element of order 4, say a. The subgroup <a> has order 4, hence index 2, so it's normal in G. Let b be an element not in <a>, so G is generated by a and b. Since [G : <a>] = 2, b² must be in <a>. Also, since G is nonabelian, conjugation by b on a gives an automorphism of <a> not equal to the identity. The automorphism group of C4 (the cyclic group of order 4) is C2, so the only nontrivial automorphism is inversion (a → a³). Therefore, bab⁻¹ = a³.\n\nNow, b² must be an element of <a>. Let's consider possibilities. If b² = a² (the element of order 2 in <a>), then we get the quaternion group Q8. If b² = 1, then we get the dihedral group D4. If b² were a or a³, then b would have order 8, which would make G cyclic (since it would have an element of order 8), contradicting nonabelian. Hence, only possibilities are b²=1 or b²=a². These give D4 and Q8 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the only nonabelian groups of order 8 are D4 and Q8. Any other nonabelian group must be isomorphic to one of these. Thus, there are exactly two nonabelian groups of order 8 up to isomorphism.",
