    "Content": "Recently, I solved a question that asked for a geometric proof of the identity $\\binom{\\binom{n}{3}}{2} < \\binom{\\binom{n}{2}}{3}$ and I did it here using the combinatorial interpretation of lines and triangles in an $n$ -gon, and exploiting the symmetry of these line-triangle configurations to provide an injective (and non-surjective) map from a set with cardinality $\\binom{\\binom{n}{3}}{2}$ to a set of cardinality $\\binom{\\binom{n}{2}}{3}$ . This brought me to the more general question : Suppose that $b>c$ . Then, for all $n$ , is the following true? $$\\binom{\\binom{n}{b}}{c} < \\binom{\\binom{n}{c}}{b}$$ (Note : we define $\\binom{k}{l} = 0$ if $l>k$ ). I want a proof of this, but I've just left some avenues open so that others can explore them below. To break the suspense, this identity is true, but I've actually never seen a proof of it, so here goes. Gamma function I looked here for some details, and apparently a \"lengthy,uninspiring computation involving Gamma functions\" is required.  Nevertheless, I couldn't quite find a reference to this computation : so I'd love one. Having said that , if someone can write up an (lengthy, uninspiring etc.) argument that involves Gamma functions, I'd be delighted. To provide some details on the link, we have : $$\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} = \\frac{\\Gamma(n+1)}{\\Gamma(n-k+1)\\Gamma(k+1)}\n$$ and therefore, nested binomial coefficients will involve nested Gamma functions, at which point I wasn't quite able to work my way through. Combinatorial interpretation The same document as above provides a telling combinatorial interpretation : $\\binom{\\binom{n}{b}}{c}$ is the number of ways of choosing a subset of $c$ elements ,from the set of subsets of $b$ elements of $\\{1,2,...,n\\}$ . which it then twists into : $\\binom{\\binom{n}{b}}{c}$ is the number of $b \\times c$ matrices with entries in $\\{1,...,n\\}$ , such that the elements are strictly increasing along rows, and the rows, interpreted as vectors , are strictly lexicographically increasing. So perhaps one can work with these combinatorial objects. On the other hand, one can see if something around what I did with the $n$ -gons can be generalized, I struggled to do so. Short note : binomial basis expansion Note also, that the linear-algebraic approach that I proposed in my answer (to give an algebraic proof of the nested binomial identity) can probably work here (i.e. writing the nested binomial coefficients in the polynomial basis $\\binom{n}{k},0<k\\leq bc$ ) : but the coefficients when one uses the binomial basis are quite complicated, see here . Note that both the nested binomial coefficients are polynomials of degree $bc$ in $n$ , so one can try to see if something works out via binomial basis expansions. Alternate definitions See if alternate definitions/generalizations of the binomial coefficient are helpful, like this one . Note that if we can make the binomial coefficient into a nice continuous-parameter function, then we can investigate these properties using real analytic methods. EDIT : This document of  Marko Riedel contains details of the Egorychev (Егорычев) method , which is basically a complex-analytic representation of the binomial coefficients. Anyone is free to use any of the identities available here, and I thank Marko for creating this useful list. The basic problem here is the nesting of the coefficients, so any fundamental operation that simplifies the nesting (converting the nesting into an operation that is easier to understand) will be appreciated, either in the comments or as a partial answer. Finally, further comments on inequalities involving further nestings like $\\binom{\\binom{\\binom{n}{a}}{b}}{c}$ and so on will be appreciated as well.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a cute argument for $b=c+1$ though I don't know how to pull it through in the general case. Let $U$ be the set of ordered $c+1$ -tuples of sets of cardinality $c$ in which no set repeats. Then, obviously, $|U|=(c+1)!{{n\\choose c}\\choose c+1}$ . Let $V$ be the set of ordered $c$ -tuples of sets of cardinality $c+1$ in which no set repeats. Then $|V|=c!{{n\\choose c+1}\\choose c}$ . Now take any element of $V$ , i.e., an ordered family of sets $A_1,\\dots,A_{c}$ . Take any $a_1\\in A_1$ ( $c+1$ choices). Suppose that $a_1\\in A_1,\\dots,a_k\\in A_k$ are already chosen. Then we want to choose $a_{k+1}\\in A_{k+1}$ so that $a_{k+1}\\ne a_j$ and $A_{k+1}\\setminus \\{a_{k+1}\\}\\ne A_j\\setminus\\{a_j\\}$ for all $j=1,\\dots,k$ . Suppose that we have $\\ell$ prohibitions of the first type. Then, if we honor them, the prohibitions of the second type for the corresponding sets will be honored automatically (if $a_j\\in A_{k+1}$ and we don't remove it, then surely $A_{k+1}\\setminus \\{a_{k+1}\\}\\ne A_j\\setminus\\{a_j\\}$ . The remaining $k-\\ell$ sets introduce at most one prohibition of the second type each, so we have $\\le k$ prohibitions total. Thus we have $\\ge c+1-k$ choices for $a_{k+1}$ . Once we run the whole procedure, the reduced sets $A_j$ listed in the same order and the set $\\{a_1,\\dots,a_c\\}$ listed last will constitute an element of $U$ and each element of $V$ will generate $\\ge(c+1)!$ different elements of $U$ (by different choices of $a_1,\\dots,a_c$ . On the other hand, each element of $U$ can be obtained from at most $c!$ elements of $V$ (that is the number of ways to distribute the elements of the last $c+1$ -st set among the first $c$ . This immediately gives a non-strict inequality you want. To make it strict, you need to assume $c>1$ and $n\\ge c+1$ (otherwise you have equality), in which case the ordered sequence of sets $A_j=\\{1,2,\\dots,c+1\\}\\setminus\\{j\\}$ has fewer than $c!$ distribution options (none at all, really) resulting in a legitimate element of $V$ . Edit (the general case) In this case it will be convenient to define $U$ as the set of all ordered $b$ -tuples of sets of cardinality $c$ such that the sets are pairwise different (as sets), the first $c$ sets are unordered, and the last $b-c$ sets are ordered. Then $|U|=b!(c!)^{b-c}{{n\\choose c}\\choose b}$ . Let $V$ be the same as before (ordered $c$ -tuples of unordered subsets of cardinality $b$ in which the sets are pairwise different), so $|V|=c!{{n\\choose b}\\choose c}$ . Now let $\\langle A_1,\\dots, A_c\\rangle$ be an element of $V$ . We want to remove $b-c$ elements $a_{j,1},a_{j,2},\\dots,a_{j,b-c}$ from $A_j$ and form $b-c$ new ordered sets $B_k=\\langle a_{1,k},a_{2,k},\\dots, a_{c,k}\\rangle$ ( $k=1,\\dots,b-c$ ) to get an element of $U$ . To this end start with choosing $a_{1,1},\\dots,a_{1,b-c}\\in A_1$ in an arbitrary way, which gives $b(b-1)\\dots(b-c+1)$ choices. Now, when choosing $a_{k+1,1}\\in A_{k+1}$ for $k\\ge 1$ , add to the standard prohibitions $a_{k+1,1}\\ne a_{j,1}$ , $A_{k+1}\\setminus\\{a_{k+1,1}\\}\\ne A_j\\setminus\\{a_{j,1}\\}$ ( $j\\le k$ ), which exclude at most $k$ elements just as before, the prohibitions $a_{k+1,1}\\ne a_{1,m}$ ( $m>1$ ), which exclude additional $b-c-1$ elements at most, leaving $c+1-k$ choices as before. These additional prohibitions guarantee that the set $B_1=\\{a_{1,1},a_{2,1},\\dots, a_{c,1}\\}$ does not contain any of the elements $a_{1,m}$ ( $m>1$ ) and, therefore, will be different from every set $B_m$ ( $m>1$ ) as an unordered set and we still have $c!$ choices. Having constructed $B_1$ , we construct $B_2$ with the standard restrictions $a_{k+1,2}\\ne a_{j,2}$ , $A_{k+1}\\setminus\\{a_{k+1,1},a_{k+1,2}\\}\\ne A_j\\setminus\\{a_{j,1},a_{j,2}\\}$ ( $j\\le k$ ) and additional restrictions $a_{k+1,2}\\ne a_{1,m}$ but now with $m>2$ . This gives $c!$ choices again, and so on. Thus, from each element of $V$ , we get $b(b-1)\\dots(b-c+1) (c!)^{b-c}$ distinct elements of $U$ . The recovery of an element of $V$ from an element of $U$ is now possible in just one way, if at all, which, again, gives a non-strict inequality. I leave it to you to figure out when and how it becomes strict in this case.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user starts by talking about an inequality involving nested binomial coefficients: they proved that binom(binom(n,3),2) is less than binom(binom(n,2),3) using a combinatorial interpretation with n-gons. Now they're asking if, in general, when b > c, is binom(binom(n,b),c) < binom(binom(n,c),b) for all n? They mention wanting a proof, possibly using Gamma functions or combinatorial interpretations. They also discuss some alternative approaches like binomial basis expansions and complex-analytic methods.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that b > c. Also, the note mentions that binom(k,l) is 0 if l > k. But does that affect the assumptions here? Let's see. The problem is for \"all n\", but the binomial coefficients might have constraints based on n. For example, binom(n,b) needs to be at least c for binom(binom(n,b),c) to be non-zero. Similarly, binom(n,c) must be at least b. But the user's note defines binom(k,l) as 0 if l > k, so maybe that's implicitly handled. However, the user doesn't specify any restrictions on n, b, c beyond b > c. The problem is stated as \"for all n\", so the assumptions should include that b and c are positive integers with b > c, and n is an integer such that the binomial coefficients are defined (i.e., n ≥ max(b,c) to avoid cases where binom(n,b) or binom(n,c) would be zero if n is smaller). Wait, but the problem says \"for all n\", so maybe n can be any integer, and if n is too small, the binomial coefficients just become zero. But the inequality would then compare 0 < 0, which is false. However, the user's example was with binom(n,3) and binom(n,2), which would require n ≥3 and n ≥2 respectively, but maybe the problem is intended for n sufficiently large? Hmm, but the user says \"for all n\", so perhaps we have to consider cases where the binomial coefficients could be zero. However, since the problem states that binom(k,l) is zero if l > k, then when binom(n,b) < c, the left-hand side is zero, and similarly for the right. But the inequality is strict (<). So if both sides are zero, the inequality 0 < 0 would not hold. But the user says \"this identity is true\", so maybe there's an implicit assumption that n is sufficiently large such that binom(n,b) ≥ c and binom(n,c) ≥ b. Wait, but in the original example with b=3, c=2, n must be at least 3 for binom(n,3) to be non-zero, but binom(binom(n,3),2) would then require binom(n,3) ≥2, which would need n ≥4. Similarly, binom(n,2) must be ≥3 for the right-hand side, which requires n ≥3. So for n=3, binom(n,3)=1, so binom(1,2)=0, and binom(n,2)=3, so binom(3,3)=1, so 0 <1, which is true. For n=4, binom(4,3)=4, so binom(4,2)=6, and binom(4,2)=6, binom(6,3)=20. So left side is binom(4,2)=6 and binom(6,3)=20? Wait, original example: binom(binom(n,3),2) < binom(binom(n,2),3). For n=4, binom(4,3)=4, so binom(4,2)=6. On the right, binom(4,2)=6, so binom(6,3)=20. So 6 <20, which holds. For n=3, left side is binom(1,2)=0, right side is binom(3,3)=1, so 0<1. For n=2, binom(2,3)=0, left side is binom(0,2)=0, right side is binom(1,3)=0, so 0 <0 is false. But the user's original problem might have been intended for n ≥3. But the user now generalizes to \"for all n\" but with b >c. So the problem's validity might depend on n being sufficiently large. However, the user's note says that binom(k,l)=0 if l>k, so in cases where binom(n,b) <c or binom(n,c) <b, one side could be zero. But since the inequality is strict, if one side is zero and the other is non-zero, then the inequality would hold. For example, if binom(n,b) ≥c but binom(n,c) <b, then left side is non-zero, right side is zero, so inequality would be false. But since the user claims the identity is true, perhaps the assumptions include that n is sufficiently large so that both binom(n,b) ≥c and binom(n,c) ≥b. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended for n ≥ some value where both sides are non-zero, but the user didn't specify. However, the user explicitly writes \"for all n\", so maybe we need to include that n is a positive integer, and b, c are positive integers with b >c. But perhaps the problem as stated includes all n, even those where the binomial coefficients are zero, but the inequality is still considered as \"true\" in the sense that it's non-strict? Wait, but the user's example works for n=3, even though binom(n,3)=1, which makes the left side binom(1,2)=0, but right side is binom(3,3)=1, so 0 <1. For n=2, left side is binom(0,2)=0, right side is binom(1,3)=0, so 0 <0 is false. So maybe the problem has an implicit assumption that n is sufficiently large. But since the user says \"for all n\", maybe the answer is that the inequality holds when both sides are non-zero, but the user's original problem might have a mistake here. However, since the user says \"this identity is true\", perhaps the correct assumption is that n is sufficiently large, i.e., n ≥ some function of b and c. But in the absence of explicit constraints, the problem is stated as \"for all n\", so we need to list the assumptions as given. The problem states \"Suppose that b >c. Then, for all n, is the following true?\" So the assumptions are:\n\n1. b and c are positive integers (since we're dealing with binomial coefficients)\n2. b > c\n3. n is an integer (possibly with n ≥1, but as per the problem statement, \"for all n\")\n\nBut considering the binomial coefficients, if n is negative, binomial coefficients can be defined using the Gamma function, but the problem mentions combinatorial interpretations, which usually deal with non-negative integers. So perhaps n is a non-negative integer. The problem mentions \"for all n\", but if n is a non-negative integer, then we can have cases where binom(n,b) is zero. However, the user includes a note that binom(k,l)=0 if l >k, which applies here. So the problem as stated allows n to be any integer (but likely non-negative), and b, c positive integers with b >c. So the assumptions are:\n\n- b and c are positive integers.\n- b > c.\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the user didn't explicitly state n is non-negative, just \"for all n\". However, in combinatorial contexts, n is usually a non-negative integer. So I'll list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nb and c are positive integers,\nb is greater than c,\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that for all n, the inequality $$\\binom{\\binom{n}{b}}{c} < \\binom{\\binom{n}{c}}{b}$$ holds.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user says \"Suppose that b>c. Then, for all n, is the following true?\" followed by the inequality. So the assumptions are exactly those three points. The note about binomial coefficients being zero when l >k is part of the definition, not an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions: b and c are positive integers; b > c; n is a non-negative integer. But wait, the problem says \"for all n\", which could include n being any integer, but binomial coefficients with negative n are defined via Gamma functions, but the combinatorial interpretation is for non-negative n. The user mentions Gamma functions, so maybe n can be any real number? Wait, no, the original problem is about combinatorial interpretations, so n is likely an integer. The user's example uses n-gon, which requires n ≥3. However, the problem statement here is more general. The user's note says \"we define binom(k,l)=0 if l >k\", which is standard for combinatorial binomial coefficients. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. b and c are positive integers.\n2. b > c.\n3. n is a non-negative integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption is one property per line. So for this problem, each line should be one assumption:\n\n- b and c are positive integers\n- b > c\n- n is a non-negative integer\n\nBut the user might not have specified that n is non-negative, but given the context, it's reasonable. Alternatively, if the problem allows n to be any integer (including negative), but given binomial coefficients with negative upper indices are treated differently, but since the problem mentions combinatorial interpretation, it's safer to assume n is a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nb and c are positive integers,\nb is greater than c,\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that for all n, the inequality $$\\binom{\\binom{n}{b}}{c} < \\binom{\\binom{n}{c}}{b}$$ holds.\n\nWait, but the original problem also mentions that when l >k, binom(k,l)=0. So for n <b or n <c, binom(n,b) or binom(n,c) would be zero, leading to one or both sides being zero. But the inequality is strict. For example, if n <b, then binom(n,b)=0, so left side is binom(0,c)=0 if c>0. Similarly, binom(n,c) is zero if n <c, so right side is binom(0,b)=0. So if both sides are zero, 0 <0 is false. Hence, the inequality as stated isn't true for all n unless n is sufficiently large. But the user claims \"this identity is true\", which suggests that maybe the intended assumption is that n is sufficiently large. However, the problem as stated by the user says \"for all n\", which conflicts with that. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps the user is mistaken. However, the task is to structure the problem as given, not to correct it. The user explicitly writes \"Suppose that b >c. Then, for all n, is the following true?\" So the assumptions are as given: b>c, and the problem is for all n. Therefore, even if for some n the inequality fails (like n=2 in the example), the problem as posed by the user is still to structure it with the assumptions listed. Therefore, the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\nb and c are positive integers,\nb is greater than c,\nn is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that for all integers n, the inequality $$\\binom{\\binom{n}{b}}{c} < \\binom{\\binom{n}{c}}{b}$$ holds.\n\nBut the user's note defines binom(k,l)=0 if l >k, which is part of the problem's definition. So the assumptions are just b and c are positive integers with b >c, and n is an integer. However, the original example didn't specify n being non-negative, but in combinatorial contexts, binomial coefficients with negative n are zero or follow different rules. However, since the problem allows n to be any integer, but uses the definition where binom(k,l)=0 if l >k, then for negative n, binom(n, b) would be zero (if we follow the standard combinatorial definition where binom(n,k) is zero if n <k). But in the real number case, binomial coefficients can be defined via Gamma functions, which the user also mentions. So perhaps n is a real number? The original problem mentions combinatorial interpretation, which suggests n is a non-negative integer. However, the user also talks about Gamma functions, which extend to real numbers. But in the problem statement, it's not specified. Given the ambiguity, but since the user's example involves n-gons, which are discrete, likely n is an integer. Therefore, the safest assumptions are:\n\n- b and c are positive integers.\n- b > c.\n- n is an integer.\n\nEven though for some integers n, the inequality might not hold (like n=2 in the example), the user still asks to prove it for all n. Therefore, the formatted problem should include those three assumptions.",
