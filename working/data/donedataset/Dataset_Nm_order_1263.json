    "Content": "Let $f(n)=3^n+5^n+7^n$ It is easy to show that $\\ 15\\mid f(n)\\ $ if and only if $\\ n\\ $ is odd.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here are some extended comments: We may look at similar functions $$\nF_{u,v,w; d}(n) = \\frac{u^n+v^n+w^n}{d}\n$$ to see if they have similar properties, where $d$ should be selected so as to make it an integer for odd $n$ , but remove any common factor. The original question regards $F_{3,5,7;15}$ . Looking at $F_{1,3,5;3}(n)$ for odd $n$ , the result is prime for $n=1$ , $5$ , $13$ , $17$ , $29$ , $41$ , $113$ , $193$ , $509$ , $617$ , $3457$ , but also for $n=301=7\\cdot 43$ , and probably for $n=9197=17\\cdot 541$ (had to resort to a probabilistic prime test). We may also look at alternatives, testing all $n<1000$ , some up to $n<10000$ (may be probabilistic prime test for large $n$ ): $F_{1,3,7;1}(n)$ is prime for $n=1,13,17,1487$ , but also for $49=7^2$ , $815=5\\cdot 163$ , and $2317=7\\cdot 331$ ; $F_{1,5,9;15}(n)$ is prime for $n=7,13,17,61,1223$ , but also for $n=913=11\\cdot 83$ , $2773=47\\cdot 59$ , $2951=13\\cdot 227$ , $7399=7^2\\cdot 151$ ; $F_{1,-3,5;3}(n)$ is prime for $n=29,619$ , but also for $121=11^2$ , $329=7\\cdot 47$ , and $n=5491=17^2\\cdot 19$ ; $F_{-1,-3,5;1}(n)$ is prime for $n=3,7,17,29,337$ , but also for $21=3\\cdot 7$ , $33=3\\cdot 11$ , $339=3\\cdot 113$ , $721=7\\cdot 103$ . It seems clear that composite $n$ tend to make $g(n)$ more composite than prime $n$ , and similarly for some alternative $F$ functions. Understanding why this is the case would be very interesting. Perhaps that might also lead to some heuristic/probabilistic argument in favour of the assumption that $g(n)$ having no prime values for composite $n$ . However, my suspicion is that there may be some composite $n$ which makes $g(n)$ prime, but potentially for very large $n$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the expression g(n) = (3^n + 5^n + 7^n)/15 is prime only if n is a prime number. They observed that for certain prime numbers n like 7, 17, 61, etc., g(n) turns out to be prime. But they also mention cases where n is composite, like 77, where g(n) has a large prime factor (463) but isn't prime itself. The question is whether being prime is a necessary condition for n to make g(n) prime.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem correctly. The user's main question is about the necessity of n being prime for g(n) to be prime. They have some examples where prime n lead to prime g(n), and composite n like 77 (which is 7*11) lead to composite g(n). But they also mention that if n is divisible by 3 or 5, then g(n) is divisible by 3 or 5 respectively, hence composite. However, there might be composite n not divisible by 3 or 5, like 77, which is 7*11, and here g(77) is composite. So the user is suggesting that perhaps n must be prime for g(n) to be prime, but they want to confirm if this is a necessary condition.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required format. The assumptions should list all conditions given or implied. The problem statement should be clear.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n- The function is g(n) = (3^n +5^n +7^n)/15.\n\n- It's stated that 15 divides f(n)=3^n+5^n+7^n iff n is odd. So g(n) is an integer only when n is odd. Therefore, the problem is concerned with odd n.\n\n- The user found that for primes n=7,17,61,71,457,8111, g(n) is prime. They want to know if n must be prime for g(n) to be prime.\n\n- They note that if n is divisible by 3 or 5, then g(n) is divisible by 3 or 5, hence composite. Therefore, composite n divisible by 3 or 5 are already handled. The remaining composite n would be those that are odd, not divisible by 3 or 5 (like 77=7*11). For such n, they checked that g(77) is composite. So the question is: Is it possible for a composite number n (which is odd, not divisible by 3 or 5) to make g(n) prime? Or is n being prime a necessary condition?\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show that if g(n) is prime, then n must be prime. In other words, if n is composite (and odd, not divisible by 3 or 5), then g(n) is composite.\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property. Let's see:\n\n1. The problem is about the expression g(n) = (3^n +5^n +7^n)/15.\n\n2. The user states that 15 divides f(n) = 3^n +5^n +7^n if and only if n is odd. Therefore, for g(n) to be an integer, n must be odd.\n\n3. The user mentions that when n is divisible by 3 or 5, g(n) is divisible by 3 or 5, respectively. Hence, such cases lead to composite numbers.\n\n4. The user is considering composite n that are not divisible by 3 or 5 (like 77) and found that g(n) can still be composite. However, the user wants to know if n being prime is necessary for g(n) to be prime.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that if g(n) is prime, then n must be prime. The assumptions would include that n is odd (since otherwise g(n) isn't integer), and possibly other conditions. Wait, the original problem says that 15 divides f(n) iff n is odd, so the only time g(n) is integer is when n is odd. Therefore, the problem is only considering odd n. Therefore, the necessary condition would be that if n is composite and odd (and not divisible by 3 or 5, but that's already implied by n being composite), then g(n) is composite.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking whether g(n) is prime only if n is prime. So the formal problem would be: Prove that if g(n) is prime, then n is prime.\n\nBut the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n is odd (since otherwise g(n) isn't integer).\n\nAdditionally, the user has examples where n is prime and g(n) is prime, and composite n (like 77) where g(n) is composite. But to structure this as per the required format, the assumptions should list all conditions given. However, in the example given by the user (the A(n) problem), they included assumptions about n being integer and divisible by 7. But in this problem, the user isn't adding any extra conditions beyond n being odd (since otherwise g(n) isn't integer). So the key assumptions here are that n is an integer, and n is odd. However, the problem is to show that if g(n) is prime, then n must be prime. Therefore, the problem is about the necessity of n being prime for g(n) to be prime, given that n is odd (since otherwise g(n) isn't integer).\n\nBut in the original problem, the user says \"searched for prime numbers of the form g(n) with odd n and found the following prime n...\", so they are only considering odd n. Hence, the problem is within the domain of odd n. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n is odd.\n\nProblem: Prove that if g(n) = (3^n +5^n +7^n)/15 is prime, then n is prime.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is phrased as \"Is g(n) only prime if n is prime?\" So the user is asking whether the primality of g(n) implies the primality of n. So the problem is to show that necessity.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n is odd.\n\nProblem: Prove that if (3^n +5^n +7^n)/15 is prime, then n is prime.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the necessary conditions are n is integer and odd, because the problem is about g(n) being prime, which requires n to be odd (otherwise, g(n) is not an integer). So these are the two assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is only considering odd n in their search, then the problem is implicitly about odd n. Hence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- n is odd.\n\nProblem: Prove that (3^n +5^n +7^n)/15 is prime only if n is prime.\n\nAlternatively, \"Show that if (3^n +5^n +7^n)/15 is prime, then n is a prime number.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is odd.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\frac{3^n + 5^n + 7^n}{15}$ is prime only if $n$ is prime.",
