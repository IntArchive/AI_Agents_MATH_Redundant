    "Content": "I got the following question as my homework. Given $V$ is a vector space with $P \\in \\operatorname{End} V$. $P \\circ P = P$ ( \"P is idempotent\" ). Show that $V = \\operatorname{Ker} P \\oplus \\operatorname{Im} P$. One $P$ I can imagine is a projection from 3d-space to plane, that just sets some coordinates to zero. For example $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z\\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$. Then $\\operatorname{Ker} P$ would give the line $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ z\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\operatorname{Im} P$ would contain all $\\begin{pmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$. So the result of $\\operatorname{Ker} P \\oplus \\operatorname{Im} P$ is of course $V$. But how do I prove that in a mathematical way?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Take $x \\in V$ . Since $P=P^2$ we must have $Px=P^2x$ and so $P(x-Px)=0$ . Hence $x-Px=\\xi$ for some $\\xi \\in \\operatorname{Ker}P$ . Thus $x = Px + \\xi$ . This shows that $V=\\operatorname{Im}P + \\operatorname{Ker}P$ . Now take $y \\in \\operatorname{Im}P \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}P$ . Since $y \\in \\operatorname{Im}P$ we have $y=Pz$ for some $z \\in V$ . Applying $P$ to both sides we get $Py=P^2z$ . But $y \\in \\operatorname{Ker}P$ , hence $0=Py=P^2z=Pz=y$ . This shows that $\\operatorname{Im}P \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}P=\\{0\\}$ and so we have $V=\\operatorname{Im}P \\oplus \\operatorname{Ker}P$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to prove that a vector space V can be written as the direct sum of the kernel and image of a projection P. Let's start by recalling the definitions. A projection P is an endomorphism of V such that P squared equals P, right? So P ∘ P = P. \n\nFirst, I should remember what kernel and image are. The kernel of P is all vectors v in V such that P(v) = 0. The image is all vectors P(v) for any v in V. The direct sum of two subspaces requires that their intersection is only the zero vector and that together they span the entire space. \n\nSo the problem is to show two things: 1) every vector in V can be written as the sum of a vector in Ker P and a vector in Im P, and 2) that Ker P and Im P intersect only at the zero vector. \n\nLet me think about how to decompose an arbitrary vector v in V. If I apply P to v, I get P(v) which is in Im P. Then maybe the difference v - P(v) would be in Ker P? Let's check: apply P to (v - P(v)). That would be P(v) - P(P(v)) = P(v) - P(v) = 0. Yes, that works. So v = (v - P(v)) + P(v), where the first term is in Ker P and the second is in Im P. That takes care of the decomposition part.\n\nNow, for the intersection. Suppose there's a vector that's in both Ker P and Im P. Let's say w is in both. Then since w is in Im P, there exists some u in V such that P(u) = w. But w is also in Ker P, so P(w) = 0. Substitute w with P(u): P(P(u)) = P(u) = w. But then P(w) = w (since P is idempotent), which equals 0. Therefore, w = 0. Hence, their intersection is trivial.\n\nWait, is that right? If w is in Im P, then w = P(u). Then applying P to w gives P(P(u)) = P(u) = w. But since w is in Ker P, P(w) = 0. Therefore, w = 0. That seems correct. So the intersection is just {0}.\n\nSo putting it all together, any vector can be decomposed into a part in Ker P and a part in Im P, and their intersection is trivial. Therefore, V is the direct sum of Ker P and Im P.\n\nHmm, but maybe I should check if there's any assumption I missed. The problem states that P is an endomorphism with P² = P. The example given is a projection onto a plane in 3D space, which fits the properties. So the key steps are the decomposition and the trivial intersection. I think that's all. Yeah, this should be the standard proof for projections and their kernels and images.",
