    "Content": "A well-known overkill proof of the irrationality of $2^{1/n}$ ( $n \\geqslant 3$ an integer) using Fermat's Last Theorem goes as follows: If $2^{1/n} = a/b$ , then $2b^n = b^n + b^n = a^n$ , which contradicts FLT. (See this , and see this comment for the reason this is a circular argument when using Wiles' FLT proof) The same method of course can't be applied to prove the irrationality of $\\sqrt{2}$ , since FLT doesn't say anything about the solutions of $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ . Often this fact is stated humorously as, \"FLT is not strong enough to prove that $\\sqrt{2} \\not \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ .\" But clearly, the failure of one specific method that works for $n \\geqslant 3$ does not rule out that some other argument could work in the case $n = 2$ in which the irrationality of $\\sqrt{2}$ is related to a Fermat-type equation. ( For example , if we knew that there are integers $x,y,z$ such that $4x^4 + 4y^4 = z^4$ , then with $\\sqrt{2} = a/b$ , we would have $a^4 x^4 / b^4 + a^4 y^4 / b^4 = z^4$ and hence \\begin{align}\nX^4 + Y^4 = Z^4, \\quad \\quad (X, Y, Z) = (ax, ay, bz) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3,\n\\end{align} a contradiction to FLT.) Is there a proof along these lines that $\\sqrt{2} \\not \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ using Fermat's Last Theorem?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about whether Fermat's Last Theorem can be used to prove that √2 is irrational. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the question carefully. The user on Math Stack Exchange is asking if there's a proof of the irrationality of √2 using FLT, similar to the overkill proof for 2^(1/n) where n ≥ 3. They mention that the usual method for n ≥ 3 doesn't work for n=2 because FLT doesn't apply to the equation x² + y² = z². However, they propose a hypothetical scenario where if we had a certain equation related to FLT, we might derive a contradiction. \n\nThe example given in the question involves a different equation, 4x⁴ + 4y⁴ = z⁴, and shows that assuming √2 is rational could lead to a solution of X⁴ + Y⁴ = Z⁴, which contradicts FLT. The user is asking if such an argument exists for √2.\n\nNow, to structure this as per the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement is whether FLT can imply √2 is irrational. \n\nLooking at the example provided by the user, the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions would be related to the existence of certain integers satisfying an equation that FLT would forbid. Specifically, the hypothetical scenario where assuming √2 is rational leads to a solution of a Fermat-type equation. But the original question is whether such a proof exists, not assuming those integers exist. Hmm, this is a bit meta.\n\nWait, the problem is asking if one can prove √2 ∉ ℚ using FLT. So the problem is to find such a proof. The assumptions here would be the premises needed for such a proof. But the user's example structures the problem based on the original question's given conditions. In the original problem example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem statement.\n\nIn this case, the original question doesn't state specific assumptions but explores the possibility. However, in the example given by the user in their question, they suppose that there's a solution to 4x⁴ + 4y⁴ = z⁴, which then leads to a contradiction with FLT. So perhaps the assumptions here would be the existence of certain integers x, y, z that satisfy a particular equation related to √2 being rational.\n\nBut the actual problem is to determine whether such a proof exists. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. Fermat's Last Theorem is true.\n2. √2 is a rational number a/b where a and b are integers.\n3. If √2 is rational, then there exist integers X, Y, Z such that X⁴ + Y⁴ = Z⁴.\n\nWait, the example in the question uses a specific equation (4x⁴ +4y⁴=z⁴) and then manipulates it with the assumption that √2 is rational to derive a contradiction via FLT. So maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- Assume that there exist integers x, y, z such that 4x⁴ +4y⁴ = z⁴.\n- Assume √2 is rational, i.e., √2 = a/b for integers a, b.\n- Then, substituting into the equation leads to X⁴ + Y⁴ = Z⁴, contradicting FLT.\n\nBut the problem is whether such an argument exists. The user is asking if there is a proof using FLT in this manner. Therefore, the problem statement is to determine if using FLT, we can prove √2 is irrational through such an argument.\n\nBut according to the user's format, the assumptions should be listed as per the problem's given conditions. In the original example, the problem had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. \n\nIn this case, the problem as posed is to prove that √2 is irrational using FLT. The user's hypothetical scenario presents a possible path, but the actual assumptions needed for such a proof would be:\n\n- Fermat's Last Theorem holds (i.e., there are no non-trivial integer solutions to xⁿ + yⁿ = zⁿ for n > 2).\n- √2 can be expressed as a ratio a/b where a and b are integers (for contradiction).\n- This leads to the existence of integers X, Y, Z satisfying X⁴ + Y⁴ = Z⁴, which contradicts FLT.\n\nBut the question is asking whether such a proof exists. Therefore, the problem is to prove that √2 is irrational using Fermat's Last Theorem. The assumptions would be those necessary for the proof. However, in the example provided by the user, the problem's assumptions are part of the original problem's statement. Here, the original problem is a question, not a statement with given conditions. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. Fermat's Last Theorem is true.\n2. √2 is rational (for contradiction).\n\nBut the user's example seems to extract specific conditions from the problem. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user had the problem statement as \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" However, in the formatted version, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back, the original problem was that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted example, they included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was not in the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\"\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include n divisible by 7. That seems like an error in the example. So perhaps the user made a mistake there, but we have to follow their format regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Fermat's Last Theorem is true.\n- √2 is rational, i.e., √2 = a/b for integers a, b.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we need to follow their structure.\n\nWait, maybe in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the user intended to structure it as such. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different context where n was supposed to be divisible by 7. Hmm. Maybe the example is not accurate. Regardless, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nThe problem is: Does Fermat's Last Theorem imply that √2 is not in ℚ? The question is asking for a proof of irrationality of √2 using FLT. The user's own example in the question suggests that if there exists a solution to 4x⁴ +4y⁴ = z⁴, then assuming √2 is rational leads to a contradiction with FLT. So the assumptions here would be the existence of such a solution, but that's part of the hypothetical argument. However, the problem is whether such an argument exists. Therefore, to structure this, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Fermat's Last Theorem is true (i.e., no non-trivial solutions to xⁿ + yⁿ = zⁿ for n > 2).\n- √2 is rational, expressed as a/b in lowest terms.\n- There exists a solution to a specific Fermat-type equation derived from the assumption √2 is rational.\n\nBut the problem statement would be: Prove that √2 is not in ℚ using Fermat's Last Theorem.\n\nBut the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's original conditions, even if they weren't explicitly stated. Given the confusion in the example, perhaps the correct way here is to list the assumptions as per the problem's necessary conditions. Since the problem is asking whether FLT can be used to prove √2 is irrational, and the method would involve assuming √2 is rational and deriving a contradiction with FLT, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Fermat's Last Theorem is true.\n2. √2 is a rational number a/b where a and b are integers.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nFermat's Last Theorem is true,\n√2 is a rational number expressed as a/b with integers a and b.\nProblem: \nProve that √2 ∉ ℚ using Fermat's Last Theorem.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to actually perform the proof, but the original question is whether such a proof exists. However, the user wants the problem structured as per the example, which seems to list the problem's conditions as assumptions and then the problem statement. Given that, perhaps the correct assumptions here are:\n\n- Fermat's Last Theorem holds (no solutions to xⁿ + yⁿ = zⁿ for n > 2).\n- √2 is rational (for contradiction).\n\nBut the problem is to prove √2 is irrational using FLT. So the answer should list these assumptions and the problem statement.",
