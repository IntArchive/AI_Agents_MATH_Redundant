    "Content": "I'm trying to prove that de normalizer $N(T)$ of the subgroup $T\\subset GL_n$ of diagonal matrices is the subgroup $P\\in GL_n$ of generalized permutation matrices. I guess my biggest problem is that I don't really know how diagonal and permutation matrices (don't) commute. Because it is not true that $DM=MD$ when $D\\in T$ and $M\\in P$ since the permutation is either horizontal or vertical, but sometimes it seems like you can do something like it. So far, I have proved that $P\\subset N(T)$, in the following way. Let $M_\\sigma\\in P$. Then $M_\\sigma=VS_\\sigma$, with $V\\in T$ and $S_\\sigma$ a permutation matrix. So $M_\\sigma DM^{-1}=VS_\\sigma D S_\\sigma^T V^{-1}$. Thus if we prove that $S_\\sigma D S_\\sigma^T$ is diagonal we are done. This is true since $S_\\sigma D S_\\sigma^T=(x_1 e_{\\sigma(1)} \\dots x_n e_{\\sigma(n)}) (e_{\\sigma^{-1}(1)} \\dots e_{\\sigma^{-1}(n)})=(x_{\\sigma^{-1}(1)}e_1 \\dots x_{\\sigma^{-1}(n)}e_n)$, where $e_i$ are the standard basis vectors. Even this is hopelessly written out. I'm trying to find a way to see what the product $S_\\sigma D S_\\sigma^T$ is without writing it in vectors. For the other way around I don't really know what to do. I'm having a hard time rewriting matrix products in a useful way. Perhaps there is a way of proving this using something completely different? Maybe you can prove it using $N(T)/T\\simeq S_n$, but this actually what I want to use my question for. When I just write what I know about a matrix $M\\in N(T)$ I just get a big system of equations that isn't really handy.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $S\\in N(T)$ . Then $SDS^{-1}$ is diagonal for each diagonal matrix $D$ . Now, conjugation preserves the spectrum, which is exactly the diagonal in the case of diagonal matrices. So the diagonal of $SDS^{-1}$ has to be the same as the diagonal of $D$ up to a permutation. From this it's not hard to setup the equations to see that $S$ has to have a unique nonzero entry per row and column, i.e. $S$ is a generalized permutation matrix. Concretely, let us write $\\{E_{kj}\\}$ for the set of canonical matrix units (i.e. $E_{kj}$ is the matrix with a $1$ in the $k,j$ position and zeroes elsewhere). Let $D=E_{11}+2E_{22}+\\cdots+n E_{nn}$ (any other diagonal matrix with all different entries in the diagonal would do). From the first paragraph, we know that $SDS^{-1}$ is $W=\\sigma(1)E_{11}+\\cdots+\\sigma(n)E_{nn}$ for some permutation $\\sigma$ . Since $SD=WS$ , we get that $$\nS_{kj}(j-\\sigma(k))=0.\n$$ For each $j\\ne\\sigma(k)$ , we have $S_{kj}=0$ ; so the only nonzero entry in the $k^{\\rm th}$ row of $S$ is $S_{k,\\sigma(k)}$ . In other words, each row of $S$ contains a single nonzero entry, so $S$ is a generalized permutation matrix.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, filter the unnecessary information, and list the assumptions and the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that the normalizer of the subgroup T of diagonal matrices in GL_n is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices. The user mentions some of their attempts, like showing P is contained in N(T) and struggling with the reverse inclusion. But I need to focus on the core assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nAssumptions: Let's parse the problem. The key elements here are:\n\n1. T is a subgroup of GL_n consisting of diagonal matrices. So each element of T is an invertible diagonal matrix.\n2. N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n. By definition, the normalizer is the set of all matrices M in GL_n such that M TM^{-1} = T.\n3. Generalized permutation matrices are matrices that can be written as a product of a permutation matrix and an invertible diagonal matrix. So each generalized permutation matrix has exactly one non-zero entry in each row and column, which can be any non-zero element, not necessarily 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove that N(T) equals the set of generalized permutation matrices. The user has already shown that P (generalized permutation matrices) is a subset of N(T). The challenge is proving the reverse inclusion: that any matrix in N(T) must be a generalized permutation matrix.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each individual condition. Let me check:\n\n- T is a subgroup of GL_n. (But since T is the set of diagonal matrices in GL_n, which are invertible because they're in GL_n, so the assumption is T is the subgroup of diagonal matrices in GL_n.)\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n. (So the normalizer is defined as matrices M where M T M^{-1} = T.)\n- P is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices in GL_n. (Each matrix in P has exactly one non-zero entry in each row and column.)\n\nBut the problem is to show N(T) = P. The user's question is about proving both inclusions, but in their attempt, they have done P ⊂ N(T) and need help with N(T) ⊂ P.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. T is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of all diagonal matrices.\n2. N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n3. P is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of all generalized permutation matrices.\n\nBut according to the example given, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break them down:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is a subgroup of GL_n.\n- Each element of T is a diagonal matrix.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n- P is a subgroup of GL_n.\n- Each element of P is a generalized permutation matrix (i.e., a product of a permutation matrix and an invertible diagonal matrix).\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is more about the relationship between N(T) and P. The user's problem is to prove N(T) = P. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n- T is the subgroup of diagonal matrices in GL_n.\n- P is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices in GL_n.\n- The task is to show that N(T), the normalizer of T in GL_n, is exactly P.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the definitions of T, N(T), and P. So perhaps each definition counts as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each definition as a separate assumption. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of diagonal matrices.\n- A generalized permutation matrix is a product of a permutation matrix and an invertible diagonal matrix.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that N(T) is equal to the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices.\n\nWait, but in the example, they had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more about group theory structures. Let me check if the problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange includes any specific conditions or if it's general. The original problem says \"prove that the normalizer of diagonal matrices in GL_n is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices\". So the key points are:\n\n- GL_n is the general linear group of degree n (invertible n×n matrices).\n- T is the subgroup of diagonal matrices in GL_n.\n- The normalizer N(T) in GL_n is the set {M ∈ GL_n | M T M^{-1} = T}.\n- P is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices (each has exactly one non-zero entry per row and column).\n\nSo the assumptions needed for the problem are:\n\n1. T is the subgroup of diagonal matrices in GL_n.\n2. N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n3. P is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices in GL_n.\n\nBut the problem is to prove N(T) = P. Therefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line. Let me check:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of all invertible diagonal matrices.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n- P is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of all generalized permutation matrices.\n\nProblem: Prove that N(T) equals P.\n\nBut perhaps the user's original problem didn't state that P is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices, but rather wants to prove that the normalizer is that subgroup. So maybe the problem is phrased as proving that N(T) is P, where P is defined as the generalized permutation matrices. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- T is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of diagonal matrices.\n- A generalized permutation matrix is a matrix with exactly one non-zero entry in each row and each column.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that N(T) is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were specific conditions on the variables. Here, the assumptions are definitions of the objects involved. The user's problem is to prove that the normalizer is the generalized permutation matrices, given that T is the diagonal matrices in GL_n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of diagonal matrices.\n- A generalized permutation matrix has exactly one non-zero entry in each row and column.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that N(T) is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices.\n\nBut maybe the third assumption about N(T) is part of the problem's setup. Wait, the normalizer is a standard concept in group theory, so perhaps it's redundant to list it as an assumption. Let me look back at the example. The example listed the problem's specific conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7), not definitions. Here, the key is that T is diagonal, P is generalized permutation matrices, and the normalizer is defined as usual.\n\nBut the problem is to show that N(T) = P. So perhaps the assumptions should be the necessary definitions required to state the problem. However, according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions. So in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7 (though the user later clarified that it's for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they included n divisible by 7 as an assumption). Wait, the example actually had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". It seems like the example might have had an error. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n that A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the key objects are T (diagonal matrices), N(T) (their normalizer), and P (generalized permutation matrices). The problem is to show N(T) = P. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. T is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of diagonal matrices.\n2. P is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of generalized permutation matrices.\n3. N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n\nBut maybe the third point is part of the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that the normalizer (which is by definition N(T)) is equal to P. So the problem is to prove N(T) = P, given that T is the diagonal matrices and P is the generalized permutation matrices. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of all diagonal matrices.\n- P is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of all generalized permutation matrices.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that N(T) equals P.\n\nBut actually, the problem is to show that the normalizer of T is P. So maybe the third assumption is redundant because N(T) is defined as the normalizer. The user is supposed to list the problem's assumptions, which in this case are the definitions of T and P, and that we're working within GL_n. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions were the conditions on n. So in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- T is a subgroup of GL_n.\n- T consists of diagonal matrices.\n- P is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices in GL_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that N(T) = P.\n\nBut I think the key is to extract all the conditions given in the problem, each as a separate line. The problem's main components are:\n\n- The group is GL_n.\n- T is the diagonal matrices in GL_n.\n- P is the generalized permutation matrices in GL_n.\n- The task is to show N(T) = P.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each of these as assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The group is GL_n, the general linear group of degree n.\n- T is a subgroup of GL_n consisting of diagonal matrices.\n- P is a subgroup of GL_n consisting of generalized permutation matrices.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that N(T) equals P.\n\nBut perhaps \"The group is GL_n\" is redundant since T is already a subgroup of GL_n. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is the subgroup of diagonal matrices in GL_n.\n- A generalized permutation matrix is a matrix with exactly one non-zero entry in each row and column.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that N(T) is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove that N(T) is equal to P, where P is defined as the generalized permutation matrices. So the assumptions are the definitions of T and P, and the problem is to show their equality via the normalizer.\n\nBut the original problem states: \"prove that the normalizer of diagonal matrices in GL_n is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices\". So the user is to assume that T is the diagonal matrices in GL_n, and P is the generalized permutation matrices, and show N(T) = P.\n\nHence, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is the subgroup of diagonal matrices in GL_n.\n- P is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices in GL_n.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that N(T) equals P.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is a subgroup of GL_n.\n- Each element of T is a diagonal matrix.\n- P is a subgroup of GL_n.\n- Each element of P is a generalized permutation matrix.\n- N(T) is the normalizer of T in GL_n.\n\nBut perhaps the definition of N(T) is part of the problem's setup and doesn't need to be listed as an assumption. The problem is to prove N(T) = P, given T and P as defined. So the essential assumptions are about T and P.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the title is \"prove that the normalizer of diagonal matrices in GL_n is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices\". So the normalizer is defined in terms of T (the diagonal matrices), and the claim is that this normalizer is P (generalized permutation matrices). Therefore, the assumptions needed are:\n\n1. T is the subgroup of diagonal matrices in GL_n.\n2. P is the subgroup of generalized permutation matrices in GL_n.\n\nProblem: Prove that the normalizer of T in GL_n is equal to P.\n\nBut since the normalizer is a standard concept, maybe it's not necessary to list it as an assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of diagonal matrices.\n- P is the subgroup of GL_n consisting of generalized permutation matrices.\n\nProblem: Prove that the normalizer of T in GL_n equals P.\n\nThis seems concise and captures the necessary conditions. Each assumption is about one object (T and P) and their respective definitions. The problem is to show the equality of the normalizer and P.",
