    "AcceptedAnswer": "We just need to show that the complement $G \\setminus H$ is open, so take $y \\in G \\setminus H$. Note that $Hy = \\{ xy : x \\in H \\}$ is an open neighbourhood of $y$ (since $1 \\in H$, and the mapping $x \\mapsto xy$ sends open sets to open sets).  This set is also disjoint from $H$, since given $x \\in H$, if $xy \\in H$ then $y = x^{-1}(xy) \\in H$, which is false by assumption).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about proving that an open subgroup H of a topological group G is also closed. The user mentions that G is a topological group where for each x in G, the map sending y to xy is a homeomorphism. They also ask for a hint.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic properties of topological groups. A topological group is a group that's also a topological space where the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous. The problem states that the left translation maps (left multiplication by a fixed element x) are homeomorphisms. That makes sense because in topological groups, left and right translations are usually homeomorphisms, as their inverses are continuous (since the group operation is continuous).\n\nNow, H is an open subgroup. Subgroups in a topological group can be either open, closed, both, or neither. The key here is to show that H is closed. Since H is open, maybe we can use the fact that the complement of H is a union of cosets of H, and if those cosets are open as well, then their union would be open, making H closed (as the complement of an open set).\n\nWait, but how exactly? Let's think. If H is open, then each left coset gH is the image of H under the left translation by g, which is a homeomorphism. Since homeomorphisms are open maps, the image of an open set under a homeomorphism is open. Therefore, each left coset of H is open. Now, the complement of H in G would be the union of all these left cosets except H itself. Since each coset is open, their union is open. Therefore, the complement of H is open, which means H is closed.\n\nBut wait, does this require the group to be Hausdorff or something? The problem doesn't mention that. However, the key property here is that translations are homeomorphisms, which allows us to say that cosets of H are open. So even if G isn't Hausdorff, as long as the translations are homeomorphisms, which they are in a topological group, then this should hold.\n\nAnother angle: in a topological group, any open subgroup is also closed. Because the group can be partitioned into disjoint cosets, each open, so the complement is a union of open sets, hence open. Therefore, H is closed.\n\nSo the main assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a topological group.\n2. For each x in G, the left translation by x (y ↦ xy) is a homeomorphism. (Though in topological groups, this is usually part of the definition, so maybe redundant here.)\n3. H is an open subgroup of G.\n\nThe problem is to prove H is closed.\n\nWait, the user's original problem says \"prove that H is also closed\". The given assumptions are G is a topological group where for each x in G, the map x ↦ xy is a homeomorphism. Wait, actually, the problem states \"the mapping x ↦ xy is a homeomorphism\". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Let G be a topological group such that for each x ∈ G the mapping x ↦ xy is a homeomorphism. If H is a open subgroup of G, prove that H is also closed.\"\n\nWait, that phrasing might be slightly off. Normally, in a topological group, the left translation map L_x(y) = xy and right translation R_x(y) = yx are both homeomorphisms. The problem here seems to state that for each x, the map sending x to xy is a homeomorphism. Wait, that's not quite standard phrasing. Maybe it's a translation issue. Wait, maybe the user meant that for each x, the map y ↦ xy is a homeomorphism. Because that's the standard left translation, which is a homeomorphism in a topological group. So perhaps there was a mistranslation or misphrasing in the original question. But assuming that's the intended meaning, that left translations are homeomorphisms.\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n- G is a topological group.\n\n- For each x in G, left translation by x is a homeomorphism. (But this is already part of being a topological group.)\n\n- H is an open subgroup.\n\nSo the problem is to show H is closed.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions to list would be:\n\n- G is a topological group.\n\n- For each x ∈ G, the left translation map y ↦ xy is a homeomorphism.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\n- H is open in G.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"H is a open subgroup of G\", so subgroup is part of the given. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a topological group.\n\n2. For each x ∈ G, the mapping y ↦ xy is a homeomorphism.\n\n3. H is a subgroup of G.\n\n4. H is open in G.\n\nThen the problem is to prove H is closed.\n\nBut actually, in the example provided by the user, the assumptions are listed as individual conditions applied to one object each. For instance, in the example, the assumptions are \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\".\n\nSo following that, each line in Assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- G is a topological group.\n\n- For each x ∈ G, the map y ↦ xy is a homeomorphism.\n\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\n- H is open in G.\n\nProblem: Prove that H is closed in G.\n\nBut wait, the first two assumptions might be combined, since the second is actually a property of topological groups. Wait, in the example, they separated \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each line is a separate condition on the same object. But here, the first assumption is that G is a topological group, and the second is a specific property (left translations are homeomorphisms), which might actually be redundant because in a topological group, left translations are already homeomorphisms. So maybe the user included that condition explicitly, perhaps the problem is stating it even though it's part of the definition, just to be explicit. So we should list both.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological group,\nFor each x ∈ G, the mapping y ↦ xy is a homeomorphism,\nH is a subgroup of G,\nH is open in G.\n\nProblem:\nProve that H is closed in G.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second assumption is redundant because it's implied by G being a topological group, but since the original problem mentions it explicitly, we should include it.",
