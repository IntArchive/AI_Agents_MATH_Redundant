    "AcceptedAnswer": "For basic step n=0: $\\binom{0}{0}=\\frac{0!}{0!0!}=2^0$ For induction step: Let k be an integer such that $0\\lt{k}$ and for all L, $0\\le{L}\\le{k}$ where $L\\in{I}$, the formula stand true. Then: $$\\binom{k}{0}+\\binom{k}{1}+...+\\binom{k}{k}=2^k$$ Now as can be illustrated easily $\\binom{k}{0}=\\binom{k+1}{0}$ and $\\binom{k}{k}=\\binom{k+1}{k+1}$. Now by using Pascal's identity, $$\\begin{align}\\binom{k+1}{0}+\\binom{k+1}{1}+\\binom{k+1}{2}+...+\\binom{k+1}{k}+\\binom{k+1}{k+1}\\\\=\\binom{k+1}{0}+\\binom{k}{0}+\\binom{k}{1}+\\binom{k}{1}+\\binom{k}{2}+...+\\binom{k}{k-1}+\\binom{k}{k}+\\binom{k+1}{k+1}\\\\=\\binom{k}{0}+\\binom{k}{0}+\\binom{k}{1}+\\binom{k}{1}+\\binom{k}{2}+...+\\binom{k}{k-1}+\\binom{k}{k}+\\binom{k}{k}\\\\=2*{\\sum_{i=0}^k\\binom{k}{i}}\\\\=2*2^k\\\\=2^{k+1}\\end{align}$$\nAs the formula is also true for $k+1$ hence by second principle of finite induction this formula is valid for all integers greator than or equal to $0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given math problem according to the specified structure, which includes listing assumptions and stating the problem clearly. The example provided shows that assumptions are individual conditions or properties applied to one object each.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question: the title is \"Proving by induction that ∑_{k=0}^n {n choose k} = 2^n\". The question body mentions proving by induction for all n ≥ 0 that the sum of binomial coefficients from k=0 to n equals 2^n. They specify using Pascal’s identity in the inductive step and note that they can prove it via binomial theorem but not induction.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"for all n ≥ 0\", so that's an assumption about n. The use of induction implies another assumption related to the inductive step, specifically the application of Pascal’s identity. However, in the example given by the user, the assumptions listed were about the variables involved (n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is an integer (since induction is typically over integers).\n2. n is greater than or equal to 0.\n3. The inductive step uses Pascal’s identity: {n+1 choose k} = {n choose k-1} + {n choose k}.\n\nEach assumption should be a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement should then be the core of what needs to be proved, which here is the sum of binomial coefficients equals 2^n, using induction with Pascal's identity.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7), even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". The user's formatted example added that assumption, which might have been inferred. But in this case, the problem explicitly states \"for all n ≥ 0\", so the assumption would be n is an integer and n ≥ 0. Additionally, the use of Pascal's identity is part of the problem's requirement, so maybe that's not an assumption but part of the problem's method. The example included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state it, but perhaps that's because the user's example was incorrect. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. So maybe the user's formatted example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be an error. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because if n is any integer, including those not divisible by 7, then the original problem's assumption shouldn't include that. But the example's formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. So maybe the user's example is wrong, but I should follow their instructions regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's instruction says to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n is greater than or equal to 0.\n- The proof uses mathematical induction.\n- The inductive step uses Pascal’s identity: {n+1 choose k} = {n choose k-1} + {n choose k}.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"use Pascal’s identity\" as part of the requirement. Is that an assumption or part of the problem's method? The example given by the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, even though the original problem didn't state it but perhaps required it for the divisibility by 91. Wait, maybe in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't explicit in the original problem. That seems confusing. But in the current problem, the user's instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem says: \"Prove by induction that for all n ≥ 0: sum of binomial coefficients = 2^n. In the inductive step, use Pascal’s identity.\" So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n ≥ 0.\n3. Pascal’s identity holds for binomial coefficients.\n\nBut Pascal's identity is a general identity in combinatorics, so perhaps it's not an assumption but a given. However, the problem says to use it in the inductive step, so maybe it's part of the problem's method rather than an assumption. But according to the example, even if the original problem mentions using a specific identity, that might be considered an assumption. For instance, in the example, the problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included that as an assumption. So perhaps in the example, the assistant inferred that divisibility by 7 is needed for the proof, hence listing it as an assumption. But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. So maybe the example is wrong. Therefore, perhaps I should not follow that example's approach of adding assumptions not explicitly stated.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem says \"for all n ≥ 0\", which implies n is an integer and n ≥ 0. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nAdditionally, the problem requires using induction and Pascal’s identity. However, the use of induction and Pascal's identity is part of the problem's instructions, not assumptions about the objects involved. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions should only include the conditions on n, and the rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nSo, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve by induction that $ \\sum_{k=0}^n{n \\choose k} = 2^n$, using Pascal’s identity in the inductive step.\n\nBut wait, the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake. So perhaps in this case, the correct approach is to list the explicit assumptions given in the problem, which are that n is an integer and n ≥ 0, and the problem is to prove the sum equals 2^n by induction using Pascal's identity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's original problem had a typo, and the user intended to include the divisibility by 7 as part of the problem. But regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions can be inferred from the problem's context. However, in the current problem, the user explicitly states \"for all n ≥ 0\", so n is assumed to be an integer (since induction is done over integers) and n ≥ 0.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve by induction that $ \\sum_{k=0}^n{n \\choose k} = 2^n$, using Pascal’s identity in the inductive step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement should include the use of Pascal's identity as part of the problem's instructions, not as an assumption. The example's problem statement includes \"use Pascal’s identity\" as part of the problem, not as an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are only about the variables and their conditions, and the method (induction, using Pascal's identity) is part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve by induction that for all n ≥ 0, $ \\sum_{k=0}^n{n \\choose k} = 2^n$, using Pascal’s identity in the inductive step.\n\nYes, this seems right. Each assumption addresses one property of n: being an integer and being non-negative. The problem statement includes the method (induction) and the required identity.",
