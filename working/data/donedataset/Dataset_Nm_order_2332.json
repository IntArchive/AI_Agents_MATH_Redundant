    "Content": "Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and $m,n\\in\\mathbb Z$, $m,n\\ge 1$. Prove that $$K[X,Y]/(X^2-Y^m)\\simeq K[X,Y]/(X^2-Y^n)$$ if and only if $m=n$. (Related to Isomorphism between quotient rings of $\\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ .) Remarks. 1) The isomorphism can be considered identity on $K$. 2) I didn't assume that $K$ is algebraically closed (although it's more or less obvious that we can) since I expect the eventual solutions will give some explanations that one can do it. One can also assume $K=\\mathbb C$ if this helps. 3) Geometric arguments are welcome, but I'm really looking for an elementary solution.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proof for $m$ and $n$ odd: Let $A_m = k[x,y]/y^2-x^m$. Let $B_m$ be integral closure of $A_m$ in $\\mathrm{Frac} A_m$. So $B_m \\cong k[t]$, with $x = t^2$ and $y=t^m$. Then $\\dim B_m/A_m = (m-1)/2$. (A basis for the quotient is $t$, $t^3$, ..., $t^{m-2}$.) Since the vector space $B/A$ is an intrinsic invariant of the ring $A$, this shows that, if $A_m \\cong A_n$ with $m$ and $n$ odd, then $(m-1)/2 = (n-1)/2$. Proof in the general case, with $\\mathrm{Char}(K) \\neq 2$ Note that $A_m$ is a domain for $m$ odd and not for $m$ even, so $A_m \\cong A_n$ imples that $m \\equiv n \\bmod 2$. We did the case where $m$ and $n$ are odd above; we now do the case that $m$ and $n$ are even. We replace the fraction field by the total ring of fractions . When $\\mathrm{Char}(K) \\neq 2$, this is $k(t) \\oplus k(u)$, with $x = (t,u)$ and $y= (t^{m/2}, -u^{m/2})$. This integral closure of $A_m$ in this ring $k[t] \\oplus k[u]$. (Notice that $t^{m/2} = (1/2)(x^{m/2} + y)$ and $u^{m/2} = (1/2)(x^{m/2} - y)$, so $t$ and $u$ are integral over $A_m$; the details are left to the reader.) A basis for the quotient is $(1,0)$, $(t,0)$, $(t^2,0)$, ..., $(t^{m/2-1},0)$ (using again that the characteristic is not $2$.) So $\\dim B_m/A_m = m/2$ and we conclude as before. In the comments above, marci points out that the condition $\\mathrm{Char}(K) \\neq 2$ is essential. Generalities The quantity $\\dim B/A$ is called the \"defect\" or the \"$\\delta$-invariant\" of the singularity. See this MO question for more.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first understand the problem thoroughly.\n\nThe original question is about proving an isomorphism between two quotient rings of the polynomial ring K[X,Y], specifically K[X,Y]/(X² - Y^m) and K[X,Y]/(X² - Y^n), and showing that this isomorphism holds if and only if m equals n. The field K has characteristic 0, and m, n are integers greater than or equal to 1.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states several conditions:\n\n1. K is a field of characteristic 0.\n2. m and n are integers (from the context, since they are exponents in the polynomial, they must be positive integers, which is clarified as m,n ≥ 1).\n3. The isomorphism between the two quotient rings is to be considered identity on K. The user mentions that the isomorphism can be considered as identity on K, which is an important condition because it restricts the type of isomorphisms we are considering—they must fix the field K. This is a crucial assumption because without it, there might be other isomorphisms that don't preserve K, but here we want those that do.\n4. The user also mentions that one can assume K is algebraically closed or even K = ℂ if needed, but they prefer an elementary solution. However, since the problem statement includes that K is a field of characteristic 0, and the isomorphism is identity on K, these are the key assumptions. The remarks about assuming K algebraically closed are additional context but not part of the problem's formal assumptions. So I shouldn't include them in the assumptions unless they are required.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"Let K be a field of characteristic 0\" so that's definitely an assumption. Then m,n are integers with m,n ≥ 1. The isomorphism is considered as identity on K, which is part of the problem's setup. The user also mentions that they didn't assume K is algebraically closed but allows for it if needed. However, in the problem statement itself, the key assumptions are K's characteristic, m and n being positive integers, and the isomorphism being identity on K.\n\nSo, to list the assumptions line by line:\n\n- K is a field.\n- K has characteristic 0.\n- m is an integer with m ≥ 1.\n- n is an integer with n ≥ 1.\n- The isomorphism between the quotient rings is identity on K.\n\nEach of these addresses one property applied to one object. The first two are about K, the next two about m and n, and the last one about the nature of the isomorphism.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that the isomorphism K[X,Y]/(X² - Y^m) ≃ K[X,Y]/(X² - Y^n) holds if and only if m = n.\n\nWait, but the original problem's statement is exactly as given. Let me check the example again. The example took the original problem, which had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which was part of the problem's conditions. But in this case, the problem's assumptions are all given in the problem statement. So the user wants to extract all the assumptions from the problem statement and structure them accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- K is a field.\n- K has characteristic 0.\n- m is an integer.\n- m ≥ 1.\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 1.\n- The isomorphism is identity on K.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, it's written as \"Let K be a field of characteristic 0 and m,n ∈ ℤ, m,n ≥ 1.\" So each condition here is separate. So K being a field, char 0, m and n integers ≥1. Then the isomorphism being identity on K is part of the problem's conditions as per the remarks. However, in the problem statement itself, the user wrote \"Prove that K[X,Y]/(X² - Y^m) ≃ K[X,Y]/(X² - Y^n) if and only if m=n.\" with the conditions given. The remarks mention that the isomorphism can be considered identity on K. So that is part of the problem's assumptions. The problem says \"Prove that ... if and only if m=n\", under the conditions that K has char 0, m,n ≥1, and the isomorphism is identity on K.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. K is a field.\n2. The characteristic of K is 0.\n3. m is an integer.\n4. m is at least 1.\n5. n is an integer.\n6. n is at least 1.\n7. The isomorphism is identity on K.\n\nBut each assumption addresses only one property applied to one object. So splitting m and n into separate lines, each with their conditions.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to prove the isomorphism holds if and only if m = n.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nK is a field,\nThe characteristic of K is 0,\nm is an integer,\nm ≥ 1,\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1,\nThe isomorphism is identity on K.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$K[X,Y]/(X^2-Y^m) \\simeq K[X,Y]/(X^2-Y^n)$$ if and only if $m=n$.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the user had an assumption that wasn't explicitly in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, looking back: the example was the original problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem then listed assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like an error, perhaps. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example, or perhaps the example was from a different problem where n being divisible by 7 was an assumption. Hmm, perhaps there was a miscommunication there. But regardless, in this current problem, we need to extract the assumptions as per the problem statement.\n\nIn our case, the problem statement says \"Let K be a field of characteristic 0 and m,n ∈ ℤ, m,n ≥1. Prove that K[X,Y]/(X² - Y^m) ≃ K[X,Y]/(X² - Y^n) if and only if m=n.\" The remarks mention that the isomorphism is considered identity on K, which is part of the problem's conditions, so that should be an assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions are:\n\n- K is a field.\n- K has characteristic 0.\n- m is an integer.\n- m ≥ 1.\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ 1.\n- The isomorphism is identity on K.\n\nEach of these is a single condition applied to one object. Then the problem is to prove the isomorphism if and only if m = n.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again. The problem says \"Let K be a field of characteristic 0 and m,n ∈ ℤ, m,n ≥ 1. Prove that...\" So splitting \"K is a field\", \"K has characteristic 0\", \"m is integer\", \"m ≥1\", same for n. Then the isomorphism is identity on K, which is part of the problem's setup as per the remarks. The user wrote \"the isomorphism can be considered identity on K\" as a remark, which is part of the problem's conditions. So that must be included as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these assumptions and the problem statement.",
