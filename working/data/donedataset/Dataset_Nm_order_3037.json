    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that the LHS is in the form of expectation of some function. Let $(X_n)_n$ be a sequence of i.i.d random variables, which follow uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. For the first case: by strong law of large numbers, $\\displaystyle S_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\overset{a.s.}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb E(X_1) = \\frac{1}{2}$. As $f$ is continuous, $f(S_n) \\to f(\\frac{1}{2})$. As $S_n \\in [0,1]$ compact, $f(S_n)$ is bounded by a constant (thus integrable on $[0,1]$). So by dominated convergence theorem, $\\mathbb E [f(S_n)] \\overset{a.s.}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb E [f(\\frac{1}{2})] = f(\\frac{1}{2})$. For the second case, $\\displaystyle (x_1\\cdots x_n)^{1/n} = \\exp(-\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\ln\\frac{1}{x_i})$. Let $Y_i = \\ln\\frac{1}{X_i}$, then by strong law of large numbers, $\\displaystyle V_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \\overset{a.s.}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb E(Y_1) = 1$. Again, as $f(e^{-V_n})$ is continuous and bounded by a certain constant (thus integrable on $[0,1]$), $\\mathbb E [f(e^{-V_n})] \\overset{a.s.}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb E [f(e^{-1})] = f(\\frac{1}{e})$. BONUS : using the same approach, if moreover, we restrict $f: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$, then\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_0^1 ... \\int_0^1 \\frac{f(x_1)+...f(x_n)}{n}dx_1...dx_n = \\int_0^1 f(x) dx$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, filter out unrelated information, and list the assumptions and the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, looking at the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The title is \"Limits of integrals,\" and the question asks to show two limits involving integrals. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo, for the first part of the problem: The function f is continuous on [0,1]. That's one assumption. Then, the limit involves integrating over multiple variables, and they want to show the limit equals f(1/2). Similarly, the second part involves the geometric mean of the variables and the limit being f(1/e). \n\nWait, the original problem states that f is continuous from [0,1] to R. So that's the main assumption for both parts. But in the example given by the user, the assumption was split into separate lines. Since the function f is applied to both limits, but the problem has two separate limits. However, the function f is the same in both cases. So, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. f is a function from [0,1] to R.\n2. f is continuous.\n\nEach assumption is one line. Then, the problem is to show the two limits. But the example given had the problem part as the main statement. However, in the user's example, they split the problem into two separate problems if there were multiple parts. Wait, in their example, the original problem was one problem with two parts. The formatted problem kept both parts under the same problem statement. So in this case, the problem has two separate limits to show. So, should I list both in the problem part?\n\nLooking at the user's example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which was kept as a single problem. In the current case, the question has two parts: two different limits. So maybe the problem should list both as separate statements under the same problem. However, the user's example didn't split the problem into parts. The original example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" even though the original problem had two parts (since n was divisible by 7, but maybe the example was different). Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, perhaps the example had a mistake, but according to the user's structure.\n\nIn any case, here the problem has two separate limits. The user's example had one problem. The current problem has two. So perhaps in the formatted problem, we list both parts. So under the problem section, both equations would be included, separated by \"and\" as in the original.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined from [0,1] to R,\nf is continuous.\n\nProblem: Show that [first limit] and [second limit].\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"How would you show that if f: [0,1] → R is continuous, then [limit1] and [limit2].\" So the assumptions are the domain and continuity of f, and the problem is to show both limits.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as two separate lines: one for the function's domain and codomain, and another for continuity. Then, the problem statement includes both limits.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from [0,1] to R,\nf is continuous.\n\nProblem: Show that \n$$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\int_0^1\\int_0^1 \\cdots \\int_0^1 f\\left( \\frac{x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_n}{n} \\right)~dx_1~dx_2\\cdots dx_n = f\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$$ \nand \n$$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\int_0^1\\int_0^1 \\cdots \\int_0^1 f((x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n)^{\\frac{1}{n}})~dx_1~dx_2\\cdots dx_n = f\\left(\\frac{1}{e}\\right).$$\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property. The problem includes both limits as per the original question.",
