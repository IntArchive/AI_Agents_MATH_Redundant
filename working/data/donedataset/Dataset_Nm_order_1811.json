    "AcceptedAnswer": "Andreas gave you a good hint : the 'central binomial coefficient'. The generic term for this (widely studied) family of series is 'Central binomial sums' (series). Your formula is a special case of the more general : $$2(\\arcsin(x))^2=\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(2x)^{2m}}{m^2\\binom{2m}{m}}$$ with $x=1/2$ and since $\\arcsin(1/2)=\\pi/6$ you'll get your answer. You may find many formulas of this kind for example in Sprugnoli's 'Sums of reciprocals of the central binomial coefficients' . Borwein and Broadhurst studied much this kind of series (very interesting reading by the way!) : 'Central Binomial Sums, Multiple Clausen Values and Zeta Values' 'Integer powers of Arcsin' At the end of 'Pi and the AGM' the Borweins propose to prove the general formula using :\n$$x \\frac{d}{dx}(\\arcsin\\ x)^2=\\frac{2x \\arcsin\\ x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$ and the fact that both $\\displaystyle f(x)= \\frac{\\arcsin\\ x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ and $\\displaystyle F(x)=\\frac{1}{2x}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(2x)^{2m}}{m\\binom{2m}{m}}$ satisfy the differential equation : $(1-x^2)f'=1+xf$ Perhaps not the direct proof you wished... Euler was probably the first to discover this formula as well as the other expressions of $\\zeta(2n)$ ( Euler's contributions to $\\pi$ formulae). Let's add that the formula proposed by the OP was part of Apery's famous proof of the irrationality of $\\zeta(3)$ since he also proved the irrationality of $\\zeta(2)$ using this formula (van der Poorten (1979) 'A proof that Euler missed..' . Compare the formula for $\\zeta(3)$ there!). Very nice stuff indeed!!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the sum from k=1 to infinity of ((k-1)!)^2 divided by (2k)! is equal to one-third of the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k². They specifically want to do this using arithmetical or symbolic manipulation, not relying on other methods like calculus or known series identities.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some factorial identities or series expansions that might relate these terms. The left-hand side (LHS) involves ((k-1)!)^2 over (2k)! which seems related to binomial coefficients or perhaps Beta functions. Maybe I can express (2k)! in terms of factorials. Let me think: (2k)! = (2k)(2k-1)...(k+1)k! But I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, I know that combinations like C(2k, k) = (2k)!/(k!)^2. Wait, our denominator is (2k)! and the numerator is ((k-1)!)^2. So the term can be written as [(k-1)!]^2 / (2k)! = 1/( (2k)(2k-1) * [ (k!)^2 / (2k)! ) * 1/k² ) ] Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAnother thought: maybe express the term as a product of fractions. Let's write out the first few terms to see a pattern. For k=1: (0!)^2 / 2! = 1/2. For k=2: (1!)^2 / 4! = 1/24. For k=3: (2!)^2 / 6! = 4/720 = 1/180. Then sum is 1/2 + 1/24 + 1/180 + ... The right-hand side (RHS) is 1/3 times the sum of 1/k², which is 1/3 * (π²/6) ≈ 0.548311... But the LHS sum, adding up the first few terms: 1/2 ≈ 0.5, plus 1/24 ≈ 0.0417, total 0.5417, then plus 1/180 ≈ 0.00555 gives about 0.5472, getting closer. So numerically it seems plausible.\n\nBut how to connect them symbolically? Maybe relate the series to the Basel problem (sum 1/k²) through some manipulation. Let me consider known series involving factorials. The Taylor series for sin, cos, etc., but those involve alternating signs. Alternatively, hypergeometric functions? The term ((k-1)!)^2 / (2k)! can be rewritten. Wait, (k-1)! = k!/k, so [(k-1)!]^2 = (k!)^2 / k². Therefore, the term becomes (k!²)/(k²*(2k)! ). So the sum is sum_{k=1}^∞ (k!²)/(k²*(2k)! ). \n\nI recall that the central binomial coefficient is C(2k, k) = (2k)!/(k!²), so 1/C(2k, k) = k!²/(2k)!. Therefore, the term is 1/(k² * C(2k, k)). So the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k² * C(2k, k)). Hmm, is there a known identity for this sum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express 1/C(2k, k) as an integral. I remember that integrals can sometimes be used to represent reciprocal binomial coefficients. For example, C(2k, k) = 4^k / sqrt(π k) approximately by Stirling's formula, but exact expressions might involve integrals. Wait, there's an integral representation: 1/C(2k, k) = \\int_0^1 t^{k}(1-t)^{k} dt multiplied by some constants? Let me check.\n\nWait, the Beta function: B(k+1, k+1) = ∫₀¹ t^k (1-t)^k dt = (k!)^2/(2k+1)! ). Hmm, but that's not directly matching. Alternatively, maybe generating functions. If I can find a generating function for the terms 1/(k² C(2k, k)), that might relate to the zeta function.\n\nAlternatively, consider known series expansions involving ζ(2). The sum 1/3 ζ(2) is π²/18. So maybe the LHS sum equals π²/18. If I can express the LHS in terms of ζ(2), that would work. But how?\n\nAnother approach: telescoping series. Maybe express each term as a difference between consecutive terms, so that the sum telescopes. But I don't see an immediate way.\n\nAlternatively, relate the LHS to the generating function of ζ(2). The generating function for ζ(2) is related to the dilogarithm function, Li_2(x) = sum_{k=1}^∞ x^k /k². But how to connect that to the LHS?\n\nWait, maybe express the term 1/(k² C(2k, k)) as an integral, then interchange sum and integral. Let's try:\n\nSince 1/C(2k, k) = k!²/(2k)! = \\frac{1}{(2k)(2k-1)} * \\frac{(k-1)!²}{(2k-2)!} ) ? Not sure. Alternatively, using the integral representation for 1/C(2k, k). Recall that C(2k, k) = \\frac{4^k}{\\sqrt{\\pi k}} (1 - \\frac{1}{8k} + ...) by Stirling's approximation, but that might not help here.\n\nAlternatively, note that the generating function for C(2k, k) is 1/sqrt(1-4x). So sum_{k=0}^\\infty C(2k, k) x^k = 1/sqrt(1-4x). But we have 1/C(2k, k) in our terms, which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps use generating functions in a different way. Let me consider the generating function for the series sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{((k-1)!)^2}{(2k)!} x^k. If I can find a closed-form for this generating function, then setting x=1 might give the desired sum.\n\nBut this seems complex. Alternatively, consider the series term:\n\n((k-1)!)^2 / (2k)! = [ (k! /k ) ]^2 / (2k)! ) = (k!²) / (k² (2k)! ) = 1/(k² C(2k, k)).\n\nSo the sum is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(k² C(2k, k)).\n\nLooking up known series, I recall that there is an identity involving the sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2 C(2k, k)} which equals π²/18. Indeed, if that's the case, then since ζ(2) = π²/6, then (1/3) ζ(2) = π²/18, which matches. So the problem is essentially to prove that sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(k² C(2k, k)) = (1/3) ζ(2).\n\nBut how to show this using symbolic manipulation? Perhaps use generating functions or known series transformations.\n\nAlternatively, note that C(2k, k) = \\frac{4^k}{\\sqrt{\\pi k}} (1 - \\frac{1}{8k} + ... ), but this is an approximation and not helpful for exact symbolic manipulation.\n\nWait, another idea: express 1/C(2k, k) as a telescoping difference. For example, using the identity involving Beta functions or recursive relations. Alternatively, note that 1/C(2k, k) can be related to 4^{-k} * something.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating functions. Let's denote S = sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2 C(2k, k)}. We need to relate S to ζ(2).\n\nI found a reference that states that this sum S is equal to (π²)/18, which is indeed 1/3 of ζ(2). The proof might involve complex analysis or integral transforms, but the user wants an arithmetical/symbolic proof.\n\nAlternatively, using generating functions and differentiating term-wise. Let's consider the generating function G(x) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^k}{k^2 C(2k, k)}. If we can find G(1), that would be our sum. To find G(x), perhaps relate it to known generating functions.\n\nAlternatively, note that C(2k, k) = \\frac{4^k (k!)^2}{(2k)!}, so 1/C(2k, k) = \\frac{(2k)!}{4^k (k!)^2}. Therefore, the term becomes \\frac{(2k)!}{4^k (k!)^2 k²}. So S = sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2k)!}{4^k (k!)^2 k²}.\n\nThis resembles the expansion of some function. The generating function for central binomial coefficients is sum_{k=0}^\\infty C(2k, k) x^k = 1/sqrt(1-4x). But here we have (2k)!/(4^k (k!)^2) = C(2k, k)/4^k = [1/sqrt(1 - x)] evaluated at x=1, but diverges. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, integrating the generating function. Let me consider integrating G(x) term-wise. Let me try to consider integrating sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2k)!}{4^k (k!)^2 k²} x^k. If we integrate once, we get sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2k)!}{4^k (k!)^2 k} x^{k}, integrating again might give sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2k)!}{4^k (k!)^2} x^{k}, which is related to the generating function of C(2k, k)/4^k, which is 1/sqrt(1 - x). Therefore, integrating twice might connect to this generating function.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let G(x) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2k)!}{4^k (k!)^2 k²} x^k.\n\nFirst, note that sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2k)!}{4^k (k!)^2} x^k = sum_{k=1}^\\infty C(2k, k)/4^k x^k = sum_{k=1}^\\infty C(2k, k) (x/4)^k = (1/sqrt(1 - x)) - 1, since the generating function starting at k=0 is 1/sqrt(1 - x).\n\nTherefore, sum_{k=1}^\\infty C(2k, k) (x/4)^k = 1/sqrt(1 - x) - 1.\n\nNow, let's denote H(x) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{C(2k, k)}{k} (x/4)^k. If we integrate the generating function from 0 to x:\n\n∫₀^x (1/sqrt(1 - t) - 1) dt = ∫₀^x (1/sqrt(1 - t)) dt - ∫₀^x 1 dt = -2 sqrt(1 - t) |₀^x - x = -2 sqrt(1 - x) + 2 - x.\n\nBut this should also equal sum_{k=1}^\\infty C(2k, k) (x/4)^{k} * (1/k), so H(x) = -2 sqrt(1 - x) + 2 - x.\n\nThen, integrating H(x) from 0 to x would give G(x), the original sum times x (but divided by k again). Wait, let's clarify.\n\nWait, G(x) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{C(2k, k)}{k²} (x/4)^k.\n\nWe have that H(x) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{C(2k, k)}{k} (x/4)^k = ∫₀^x [sum_{k=1}^\\infty C(2k, k) (t/4)^k} ] dt/t. Wait, integrating term-wise:\n\nsum_{k=1}^\\infty C(2k, k) (x/4)^k /k = ∫₀^x [sum_{k=1}^\\infty C(2k, k) (t/4)^k } ] dt /t.\n\nBut sum_{k=1}^\\infty C(2k, k) (t/4)^k = 1/sqrt(1 - t) - 1. Therefore, H(x) = ∫₀^x [1/sqrt(1 - t) - 1] dt /t.\n\nBut this integral might be tricky. Let's compute it:\n\nH(x) = ∫₀^x [1/sqrt(1 - t) - 1]/t dt.\n\nLet me make substitution u = sqrt(1 - t), then t = 1 - u², dt = -2u du. When t=0, u=1; t=x, u=sqrt(1 - x).\n\nBut substituting:\n\nH(x) = ∫_{u=1}^{u=sqrt(1 - x)} [1/u - 1] / (1 - u²) * (-2u) du.\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\n[ (1/u - 1) / (1 - u²) ] * (-2u) = [ (1 - u)/u / ( (1 - u)(1 + u) ) ] * (-2u) = [ 1/(u(1 + u)) ] * (-2u) = -2/(1 + u).\n\nTherefore, H(x) = ∫_{1}^{sqrt(1 - x)} -2/(1 + u) du = 2 ∫_{sqrt(1 - x)}^{1} 1/(1 + u) du = 2 [ln(1 + u)] from sqrt(1 -x) to 1 = 2 [ln(2) - ln(1 + sqrt(1 - x))].\n\nThus, H(x) = 2 ln(2) - 2 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - x)).\n\nNow, G(x) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{C(2k, k)}{k²} (x/4)^k = ∫₀^x H(t) dt /t. Wait, no: G(x) would be the integral of H(t) dt from 0 to x, but let's check.\n\nWait, H(x) is the first integral of the generating function. To get G(x), which is sum_{k=1}^\\infty (C(2k, k)/k²) (x/4)^k, we need to integrate H(t)/t from 0 to x:\n\nG(x) = ∫₀^x H(t)/t dt.\n\nSubstituting H(t) = 2 ln(2) - 2 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t)), we have:\n\nG(x) = ∫₀^x [2 ln(2) - 2 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t)) ] / t dt.\n\nThis integral seems complicated, but perhaps we can evaluate it at x=1 to get the desired sum S = G(1).\n\nSo, S = G(1) = ∫₀^1 [2 ln(2) - 2 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t)) ] / t dt.\n\nLet me make a substitution. Let u = sqrt(1 - t), so t = 1 - u², dt = -2u du. When t=0, u=1; t=1, u=0.\n\nChanging variables:\n\nS = ∫_{u=1}^{u=0} [2 ln(2) - 2 ln(1 + u) ] / (1 - u²) * (-2u) du.\n\nSimplify the integral:\n\nS = 2 ∫₀^1 [2 ln(2) - 2 ln(1 + u) ] * u / (1 - u²) du.\n\nFactor out the 2:\n\nS = 4 ∫₀^1 [ln(2) - ln(1 + u)] * u / (1 - u²) du.\n\nNote that 1 - u² = (1 - u)(1 + u), so:\n\nS = 4 ∫₀^1 [ln(2/(1 + u))] * u / ( (1 - u)(1 + u) ) du.\n\nThis can be split into partial fractions or find another substitution. Let me set v = 1 - u, then when u=0, v=1; u=1, v=0. But not sure. Alternatively, split the fraction:\n\nu / (1 - u²) = [ (1 + u) - 1 ] / (2(1 - u²)) ??? Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that ln(2/(1 + u)) = ln(2) - ln(1 + u). So split the integral:\n\nS = 4 [ ln(2) ∫₀^1 u/(1 - u²) du - ∫₀^1 u ln(1 + u)/(1 - u²) du ].\n\nCompute each integral separately.\n\nFirst integral: ∫₀^1 u/(1 - u²) du. Let w = 1 - u², dw = -2u du, so -dw/2 = u du. Limits: u=0 → w=1; u=1 → w=0.\n\nIntegral becomes -1/2 ∫₁⁰ dw/w = 1/2 ∫₀¹ dw/w = 1/2 [ln|w| ]₀¹. But ln(0) is -infinity. So this integral diverges. Wait, that can't be. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, the integral ∫₀^1 u/(1 - u²) du = ∫₀^1 [ -1/(2) d(1 - u²) ] / (1 - u²) ) = -1/2 ∫₁⁰ dw/w = 1/2 ∫₀¹ dw/w. But ∫ dw/w from 0 to1 is divergent. This suggests that the first integral is divergent, which contradicts our sum S being finite. Therefore, I must have made an error in the substitution or the approach.\n\nWait, this suggests that my method to express G(x) through double integration might not be valid, or perhaps the interchange of sum and integral is not justified. Alternatively, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps another substitution in the integral for G(x). Let me try a different substitution when evaluating S = G(1):\n\nS = ∫₀^1 [2 ln(2) - 2 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t)) ] / t dt.\n\nLet me set y = sqrt(1 - t). Then t = 1 - y², dt = -2y dy. When t=0, y=1; t=1, y=0. So:\n\nS = ∫₁⁰ [2 ln(2) - 2 ln(1 + y) ] / (1 - y²) (-2y) dy.\n\nSimplify:\n\nS = 4 ∫₀¹ [ ln(2) - ln(1 + y) ] * y / (1 - y²) dy.\n\nThis is the same integral as before. Now, split the logarithm:\n\nln(2) - ln(1 + y) = ln(2/(1 + y)).\n\nThus,\n\nS = 4 ∫₀¹ y ln(2/(1 + y)) / (1 - y²) dy.\n\nPerhaps express 1/(1 - y²) = 1/(2) [1/(1 - y) + 1/(1 + y)].\n\nSo:\n\nS = 4/2 ∫₀¹ y ln(2/(1 + y)) [1/(1 - y) + 1/(1 + y)] dy\n\n= 2 [ ∫₀¹ y ln(2/(1 + y)) / (1 - y) dy + ∫₀¹ y ln(2/(1 + y)) / (1 + y) dy ]\n\nLet’s tackle each integral separately.\n\nFirst integral: I1 = ∫₀¹ y ln(2/(1 + y)) / (1 - y) dy.\n\nSecond integral: I2 = ∫₀¹ y ln(2/(1 + y)) / (1 + y) dy.\n\nStarting with I2, let’s substitute z = 1 + y, so when y=0, z=1; y=1, z=2. Then:\n\nI2 = ∫₁² (z -1) ln(2/z) / z * dz.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= ∫₁² (z -1)/z * ln(2/z) dz\n\n= ∫₁² (1 - 1/z) ln(2/z) dz.\n\nExpand:\n\n= ∫₁² ln(2/z) dz - ∫₁² ln(2/z) / z dz.\n\nFirst part: ∫ ln(2/z) dz = ∫ ln2 - ln z dz = ln2 * (2 -1) - [z ln z - z] from 1 to 2 = ln2 - [ (2 ln2 - 2) - (0 -1) ] = ln2 - (2 ln2 -2 +1) = ln2 - (2 ln2 -1) = -ln2 +1.\n\nSecond part: ∫ ln(2/z)/z dz. Let u = ln(2/z), dv = 1/z dz. Wait, alternatively, substitute w = ln(2/z). Let me set t = ln(2/z), then z = 2 e^{-t}, dz = -2 e^{-t} dt. But this might complicate. Alternatively, note that ∫ ln(2/z)/z dz = ∫ (ln2 - lnz)/z dz = ln2 ∫1/z dz - ∫ (lnz)/z dz = ln2 ln z - (lnz)^2 / 2 + C.\n\nEvaluate from 1 to 2:\n\n= ln2 (ln2 - ln1) - [ (ln2)^2 /2 - (ln1)^2 /2 ] = ln2 * ln2 - ( (ln2)^2 /2 ) = (ln2)^2 - (ln2)^2 /2 = (ln2)^2 /2.\n\nThus, I2 = [ -ln2 +1 ] - ( (ln2)^2 /2 ) = -ln2 +1 - (ln2)^2 /2.\n\nNow, let’s handle I1 = ∫₀¹ y ln(2/(1 + y)) / (1 - y) dy.\n\nThis integral seems more complicated. Let me try substitution. Let u = 1 - y, so y = 1 - u, dy = -du. When y=0, u=1; y=1, u=0.\n\nI1 = ∫₁⁰ (1 - u) ln(2/(2 - u)) / u (-du)\n\n= ∫₀¹ (1 - u) ln(2/(2 - u)) / u du.\n\n= ∫₀¹ [ (1 - u)/u ] ln(2/(2 - u)) du.\n\nSplit into two terms:\n\n= ∫₀¹ [1/u -1] ln(2/(2 - u)) du.\n\n= ∫₀¹ ln(2/(2 - u)) /u du - ∫₀¹ ln(2/(2 - u)) du.\n\nLet’s evaluate these separately.\n\nFirst integral: J1 = ∫₀¹ ln(2/(2 - u)) /u du.\n\nLet’s expand ln(2/(2 - u)) = ln2 - ln(2 - u).\n\nThus,\n\nJ1 = ∫₀¹ [ln2 - ln(2 - u)] /u du = ln2 ∫₀¹ 1/u du - ∫₀¹ ln(2 - u)/u du.\n\nBut ∫₀¹ 1/u du diverges. Uh-oh, this suggests another divergence, but our original sum S is finite. This indicates that perhaps my approach is flawed, or the interchange of integrals and sums is invalid.\n\nGiven that this path leads to divergent integrals, perhaps there's a different approach needed. Let me go back to the original problem and think differently.\n\nThe original problem is to show that the sum equals 1/3 of the Basel problem sum. Since the Basel problem sum is ζ(2) = π²/6, the desired result is ζ(2)/3 = π²/18.\n\nAnother approach: use generating functions related to the dilogarithm. The dilogarithm function Li_2(z) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty z^k /k². If I can express the LHS sum in terms of Li_2(z) evaluated at some z, and relate that to ζ(2), maybe through known dilogarithm identities.\n\nRecall that Li_2(1) = ζ(2), Li_2(-1) = -π²/12, etc. There's an identity called the dilogarithm reflection formula or other identities. Perhaps consider generating functions involving Li_2(z) and relate it to the sum.\n\nAlternatively, use the integral representation of the dilogarithm: Li_2(z) = -∫₀^z ln(1 - t)/t dt.\n\nBut how to connect this to our sum. Let's recall that the terms involve 1/(k² C(2k, k)). If we can express 1/C(2k, k) as an integral, then interchange sum and integral.\n\nEarlier, I thought about Beta functions. Recall that:\n\n∫₀¹ t^{k}(1-t)^{k} dt = B(k+1, k+1) = (k!)^2/(2k+1)!.\n\nBut our term is ((k-1)!)^2/(2k)! = (k!²)/(k² (2k)! ) = 1/(k² C(2k, k)).\n\nWait, using the Beta function:\n\nB(k, k) = ∫₀¹ t^{k-1}(1-t)^{k-1} dt = ( (k-1)! )^2 / (2k - 1)! ).\n\nSo, ((k-1)! )^2 / (2k)! = B(k, k) / (2k(2k - 1)).\n\nBut B(k, k) = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2k-1} dθ, but not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, express ((k-1)! )^2 / (2k)! = B(k, k)/(2k(2k -1)).\n\nThen, sum_{k=1}^\\infty ((k-1)! )^2 / (2k)! = sum_{k=1}^\\infty B(k, k)/(2k(2k -1)).\n\nBut B(k, k) = ∫₀¹ t^{k-1}(1-t)^{k-1} dt.\n\nSo interchange sum and integral:\n\nsum_{k=1}^\\infty [ ∫₀¹ t^{k-1}(1-t)^{k-1} dt ] / (2k(2k -1)).\n\n= ∫₀¹ sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ t^{k-1}(1-t)^{k-1} / (2k(2k -1)) ] dt.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe the inner sum can be simplified.\n\nLet’s consider the inner sum S(t) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ t^{k-1}(1-t)^{k-1} ] / (2k(2k -1)).\n\nLet’s make substitution m = k-1, so k = m+1:\n\nS(t) = sum_{m=0}^\\infty [ t^m (1-t)^m ] / (2(m+1)(2m +1)).\n\nThis is sum_{m=0}^\\infty [ t(1-t) ]^m / [2(m+1)(2m +1)].\n\nLet’s denote x = t(1-t), then:\n\nS(t) = (1/2) sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m / [ (m+1)(2m +1) ].\n\nThis can be split using partial fractions:\n\n1/[ (m+1)(2m +1) ] = A/(m+1) + B/(2m +1).\n\nSolving for A and B:\n\n1 = A(2m +1) + B(m +1).\n\nLet m = -1: 1 = A(-2 +1) + B(0) → 1 = -A → A = -1.\n\nLet m = -1/2: 1 = A(0) + B(-1/2 +1) = B(1/2) → B = 2.\n\nThus:\n\n1/[ (m+1)(2m +1) ] = -1/(m+1) + 2/(2m +1).\n\nTherefore,\n\nS(t) = (1/2) sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m [ -1/(m+1) + 2/(2m +1) ].\n\n= (1/2) [ -sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m/(m+1) + 2 sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m/(2m +1) ].\n\n= (1/2) [ - (1/x) sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^{m+1}/(m+1) + 2 sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m/(2m +1) ].\n\nRecognize that sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^{m+1}/(m+1) = -ln(1 -x), and sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m/(2m +1) can be expressed using a hypergeometric function or integrating.\n\nThus,\n\nS(t) = (1/2) [ - (-ln(1 -x)/x) + 2 sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m/(2m +1) ].\n\n= (1/2) [ ln(1 -x)^{-1/x} + 2 sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m/(2m +1) ].\n\nWait, more carefully:\n\nsum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m/(2m +1) = (1/√x) arctanh(√x) for |x| <1. Let’s verify:\n\nLet’s consider sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m/(2m +1) = (1/√x) sum_{m=0}^\\infty (√x)^{2m +1}/(2m +1) ) = (1/√x) arctanh(√x).\n\nYes, since arctanh(z) = sum_{m=0}^\\infty z^{2m +1}/(2m +1) for |z| <1.\n\nTherefore, sum_{m=0}^\\infty x^m/(2m +1) = arctanh(√x)/√x.\n\nThus,\n\nS(t) = (1/2) [ ln(1 -x)^{-1/x} + 2 * arctanh(√x)/√x ].\n\nBut x = t(1 -t), so √x = sqrt(t(1 -t)). \n\nBut substituting back:\n\nS(t) = (1/2) [ ln(1/(1 -x)) /x + 2 * arctanh(√x)/√x ].\n\nSince x = t(1 -t), 1 -x = 1 - t + t².\n\nWait, compute 1 -x = 1 - t(1 -t) = 1 -t + t².\n\nBut ln(1 -x) = ln(1 - t + t²). \n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps this approach is not the most efficient.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity of the integral approach, maybe there's a known identity or a combinatorial identity that directly relates the sum to ζ(2)/3.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the sum S = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(k² C(2k, k)) is known to be π²/18, which is 1/3 ζ(2). Therefore, the problem is to show this identity through symbolic manipulation.\n\nSince the user wants to go from LHS to RHS by symbolic means, perhaps using generating functions and integral transforms as above, but the process is quite involved and requires knowledge of advanced series manipulations, generating functions, and integral calculus. \n\nAlternatively, another approach could involve expressing the term ((k-1)! )^2/(2k)! as a combination of terms that telescope when summed, but I don't see an immediate telescoping pattern.\n\nAnother idea: using the integral representation of 1/k². Recall that 1/k² = ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ (xy)^{k-1} dx dy. Then interchange the sum and integrals.\n\nLet’s try:\n\nsum_{k=1}^\\infty ((k-1)! )^2/(2k)! * 1/k² = sum_{k=1}^\\infty ((k-1)! )^2/(2k)! ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ (xy)^{k-1} dx dy.\n\n= ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ sum_{k=1}^\\infty ((k-1)! )^2/(2k)! (xy)^{k-1} dx dy.\n\nLet’s change index m = k-1:\n\n= ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ sum_{m=0}^\\infty (m! )^2/(2(m+1))! (xy)^m dx dy.\n\n= ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ sum_{m=0}^\\infty (m! )^2/(2(m+1))! (xy)^m dx dy.\n\nThis sum can be related to a hypergeometric function. The term (m! )^2/(2(m+1))! = (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 2)! ) = 1/( (2m +2)(2m +1) C(2m+2, m+1)/4^{m+1} )? Not sure. Alternatively, note that (2(m+1))! = (2m +2)! = (2m +2)(2m +1)(2m)!.\n\nSo (m! )^2 / (2(m+1))! = (m! )^2 / [ (2m +2)(2m +1)(2m)! ) ] = [ (m! )^2 / (2m)! ) ] * 1/[ (2m +2)(2m +1) ].\n\nBut (m! )^2 / (2m)! ) = 1/C(2m, m). So the term becomes 1/[ C(2m, m) (2m +2)(2m +1) ].\n\nThus, the sum becomes sum_{m=0}^\\infty [xy]^m / [ C(2m, m) (2m +2)(2m +1) ].\n\nThis still seems complicated. Maybe another substitution or generating function.\n\nAlternatively, recognize that the sum resembles the expansion of an elliptic integral or some special function, but this is beyond basic symbolic manipulation.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the answer hinges on recognizing the sum as a known series that equals π²/18, which is 1/3 of the Basel problem sum. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture the core assumption that the equality holds by symbolic manipulation, listing the series expressions as assumptions.",
