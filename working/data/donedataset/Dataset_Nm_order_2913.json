    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem as per the required format. The original question is about proving that the infimum of a certain sum involving absolute values of sine functions is greater than zero for any positive integer p. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that for any positive integer p, we need to look at the sum of |sin(n^p)|, |sin((n+1)^p)|, ..., up to |sin((n+p)^p)| for n in natural numbers. The infimum of this sum over all n should be greater than zero. \n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Here, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. p is a positive integer. This is given in the problem statement.\n2. The infimum is taken over all natural numbers n. The problem specifies n ∈ ℕ.\n3. The sum is from k=0 to p, so the terms are |sin((n+k)^p)|. Each term in the sum is the absolute value of sine of (n+k) raised to the power p.\n\nWait, but do I need to split these into separate assumptions? The example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the main objects are p and n. The problem states that p is a positive integer. Then, for each p, we consider n in natural numbers. The sum is over k from 0 to p. So each part of the problem's conditions should be an assumption line.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nAssumption:\np is a positive integer,\nn is a natural number,\nthe sum is over k from 0 to p,\neach term in the sum is |sin((n + k)^p)|.\n\nBut in the example, they didn't list each term's structure as an assumption. Wait, the example only listed the assumptions about the variables. For instance, in the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem was then stated with the expression. So perhaps here, the assumptions are about p and n. The problem involves the infimum over n of the sum from k=0 to p of |sin((n+k)^p)|. The problem is to show this infimum is greater than zero.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a positive integer.\n- n is a natural number (since the infimum is over n ∈ ℕ).\n- The sum is taken from k=0 to p (so the sum has p+1 terms).\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\np is a positive integer,\nn is a natural number,\nthe sum includes terms for k = 0 to p,\neach term in the sum is |sin((n + k)^p)|.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, but the formatted version split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem here, the user hasn't specified any divisibility conditions. The problem is general for any positive integer p and natural number n.\n\nWait, the problem states \"for any positive integer number p\", so p is any positive integer. The infimum is over n in natural numbers. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\np is a positive integer,\nn is a natural number,\nthe sum is over k from 0 to p (inclusive),\neach term in the sum is |sin((n + k)^p)|.\n\nBut maybe \"the sum is over k from 0 to p\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The example didn't list the structure of A(n) as an assumption but included it in the problem.\n\nHmm. Looking at the example, the assumptions were about the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). The problem then states the expression and the conclusion. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a positive integer.\n- n is a natural number.\n\nThen the problem is to show that the infimum of the sum from k=0 to p of |sin((n + k)^p)| over all n in natural numbers is greater than zero.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\np is a positive integer,\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that\n$$\\inf\\left\\{ \\sum_{k=0}^{p} \\lvert\\sin{(n + k)^p}\\rvert \\, : \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\} > 0.$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem's sum is from k=0 to p, so the terms are (n), (n+1), ..., (n+p). However, in the problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n$$\\inf\\left\\{ {\\left\\vert\\sin{(n^p)}\\right\\vert+\\left\\vert\\sin{(n+1)^p}\\right\\vert+\\cdots+\n\\left\\vert\\,\\sin{(n+p)^p}\\right\\vert\\, :\\,n\\in \\mathbb{N}}\\right\\}>0.$$\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user wrote \"sum from k=0 to p\", but in the LaTeX, it's n^p, (n+1)^p, ..., (n+p)^p. Wait, that would be for k from 0 to p, the exponents are (n + k)^p. Wait, no, actually, the original problem's LaTeX is:\n\n$$\\inf\\left\\{\n{\\left\\vert\\sin{(n^p)}\\right\\vert+\\left\\vert\\sin{(n+1)^p}\\right\\vert+\\cdots+\n\\left\\vert\\,\\sin{(n+p)^p}\\right\\vert\\, :\\,n\\in \\mathbb{N}}\\right\\}>0.$$\n\nSo the sum is from k=0 to p, where each term is |sin((n + k)^p)|. Wait, no, in the LaTeX, the first term is sin(n^p), then sin((n+1)^p), up to sin((n+p)^p). So that's k from 0 to p, (n + k)^p. Wait, when k=0, it's n^p, k=1, (n+1)^p,..., k=p, (n + p)^p. So the sum is over k=0 to p of |sin((n + k)^p)|. So that's correct. Therefore, the problem is as stated.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a positive integer.\n- n is a natural number.\n\nBecause the problem says \"for any positive integer number p\", and the infimum is over n in natural numbers. The sum is over k from 0 to p, which is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the assumptions are about the variables, not the structure of the sum. So in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, p is a positive integer, n is a natural number. The rest is part of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\np is a positive integer,\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that\n$$\\inf\\left\\{ \\sum_{k=0}^{p} \\lvert\\sin{(n + k)^p}\\rvert \\, : \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\} > 0.$$\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the sum is written as from sin(n^p) to sin((n+p)^p). So when k=0, it's (n + 0)^p = n^p, and when k=p, it's (n + p)^p. Therefore, the sum is from k=0 to p of |sin((n + k)^p)|.\n\nBut in the user's original problem statement, they wrote:\n\n$$\\inf\\left\\{\n{\\left\\vert\\sin{(n^p)}\\right\\vert+\\left\\vert\\sin{(n+1)^p}\\right\\vert+\\cdots+\n\\left\\vert\\,\\sin{(n+p)^p}\\right\\vert\\, :\\,n\\in \\mathbb{N}}\\right\\}>0.$$\n\nSo the terms are (n)^p, (n+1)^p, ..., (n+p)^p, which correspond to k from 0 to p. Hence, the sum is sum_{k=0}^p |sin((n + k)^p)|.\n\nTherefore, the problem is correctly stated as such.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have assumptions about p and n, and the problem is as stated. The user's try mentions a lemma and some steps for p=2, but the actual problem is to show the infimum is positive for any positive integer p.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should have:\n\nAssumption:\np is a positive integer,\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that\n$$\\inf\\left\\{ \\sum_{k=0}^{p} \\lvert\\sin{(n + k)^p}\\rvert \\, : \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\right\\} > 0.$$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the exponent is p on (n + k), so (n + k)^p. So the terms are |sin((n + k)^p)|. The problem is to show that the infimum over all natural numbers n of this sum is greater than zero. Therefore, that's the correct problem statement.\n\nAdditionally, the user mentions the author's hint involving a sum with binomial coefficients and (n + p - i)^p equaling p factorial. That's part of the problem's context but not the assumptions. The hint is part of the problem's solving process but not the problem's conditions. Therefore, it's not included in the formatted problem.\n\nSo, the assumptions are p is a positive integer and n is a natural number. The problem is to show the infimum is positive.",
