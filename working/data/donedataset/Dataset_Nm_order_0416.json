    "Content": "In Spivak's Calculus 3rd Edition , there is an exercise to prove the following: $$x^n - y^n = (x-y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} y + ... + x y^{n-2} + y^{n-1})$$ I can't seem to get the answer. Either I've gone wrong somewhere, I'm overlooking something, or both. Here's my (non) proof: $$\\begin{align*}\nx^n - y^n &= (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y +\\cdots+ xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1}) \\\\\n          &= x \\cdot x^{n-1} + x \\cdot x^{n-2} \\cdot y + \\cdots + x \\cdot x \\cdot y^{n-2} + x \\cdot y^{n-1}\\\\\n&\\qquad + (-y) \\cdot x^{n-1} + (-y) \\cdot x^{n-2} \\cdot y + \\cdots + (-y) \\cdot x \\cdot y^{n-2} + (-y) \\cdot y^{n-1}\\\\\n          &= x^n + x^{n-1} y + \\cdots + x^2 y^{n-2} + x y^{n-1} - x^{n-1}y - y^2 x^{n-2}  - \\cdots- x y^{n-1} - y^n \\\\\n          &= x^n + x^2 y^{n-2} - x^{n-2} y^2 - y^n  \\\\\n          &\\neq x^n - y^n\n\\end{align*}$$ Is there something I can do with $x^n + x^2 y^{n-2} - x^{n-2} y^2 - y^n$ that I'm not seeing, or did I make a mistake early on? EDIT: I should have pointed out that this exercise is meant to be done using nine of the twelve basic properties of numbers that Spivak outlines in his book: Associate law for addition Existence of an additive identity Existence of additive inverses Commutative law for additions Associative law for multiplication Existence of a multiplicative identity Existence of multiplicative inverses Commutative law for multiplication Distibutive law",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You have everything right except the last line. Maybe it is easier to do in this order: $$(x−y)\\left(x^{n−1}+x^{n−2}y+\\cdots+xy^{n−2}+y^{n−1}\\right)=\\\\\n=x\\cdot x^{n-1}-y\\cdot x^{n-1} +x\\cdot x^{n−2}y-\ny\\cdot x^{n−2}y+x\\cdot x^{n−3}y^2-\\cdots\\\\  \\cdots -y\\cdot x^2y^{n-3} +x\\cdot xy^{n-2}-y \\cdot y^{n-1}$$ The second term $y\\cdot x^{n-1}$ is the same as the third term $x\\cdot x^{n−2}y$  except the sign, similarly the 4th and the 5th terms are canceled... So the only terms left are: $x\\cdot x^{n-1}$ and $y\\cdot y^{n-1}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove the identity \\( x^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\cdots + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1}) \\). They tried expanding the right-hand side but ended up with \\( x^n + x^2 y^{n-2} - x^{n-2} y^2 - y^n \\), which doesn't simplify to \\( x^n - y^n \\). Hmm, where did they go wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to check their steps. Let's go through their expansion step by step. They start with \\( (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\cdots + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1}) \\). When distributing, they split it into two parts: multiplying by x and then by -y. \n\nMultiplying by x gives terms like \\( x \\cdot x^{n-1} = x^n \\), then \\( x \\cdot x^{n-2}y = x^{n-1}y \\), and so on until \\( x \\cdot y^{n-1} \\). Then multiplying by -y: \\( -y \\cdot x^{n-1} \\), \\( -y \\cdot x^{n-2}y = -y^2 x^{n-2} \\), etc., down to \\( -y \\cdot y^{n-1} = -y^n \\).\n\nWhen they combined all these terms, they wrote:\n\\( x^n + x^{n-1} y + \\cdots + x^2 y^{n-2} + x y^{n-1} - x^{n-1}y - y^2 x^{n-2} - \\cdots - x y^{n-1} - y^n \\). \n\nThe middle terms should cancel out. For example, the \\( x^{n-1}y \\) from the first part cancels with the \\( -x^{n-1}y \\) from the second part. Similarly, \\( x^{n-2}y^2 \\) would cancel with the next term, and so on, all the way until the \\( x y^{n-1} \\) cancels with \\( -x y^{n-1} \\). \n\nBut in their final step, they only have \\( x^n + x^2 y^{n-2} - x^{n-2} y^2 - y^n \\), which suggests that they didn't account for all the cancellation properly. Maybe they omitted the middle terms in the ellipsis (the ...), thinking they don't matter, but actually, each pair cancels out. So the correct result after cancellation should be \\( x^n - y^n \\), which matches the left-hand side.\n\nAnother way to see this is by induction. For n=1, the left side is x - y, and the right side is (x - y)(1), which is the same. Assume it's true for n=k. Then for n=k+1, we can write \\( x^{k+1} - y^{k+1} = x \\cdot x^k - y \\cdot y^k = x(x^k - y^k) + y^k(x - y) \\). Using the induction hypothesis, substitute \\( x^k - y^k = (x - y)(x^{k-1} + \\cdots + y^{k-1}) \\), and then simplify. That would show the identity holds for k+1.\n\nAlternatively, using the distributive law directly: when you expand the right-hand side, every term except the first and last cancels out. The first term is x multiplied by the entire sum, giving x^n + x^{n-1}y + ... + x y^{n-1}, and the second term is -y multiplied by the sum, giving -x^{n-1}y - ... - y^n. When you add these two results, all middle terms cancel, leaving x^n - y^n.\n\nThe user might have made a mistake in the expansion by not correctly tracking all the middle terms, leading to incomplete cancellation. They need to ensure that each term in the expansion is accounted for and that the cancellation is complete.",
