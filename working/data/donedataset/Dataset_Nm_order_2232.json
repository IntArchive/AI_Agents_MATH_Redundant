    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that $\\mbox{kernel}(f)$ is dense in $X$. Since $f$ is non-zero, there exists $x\\in X$ such that $f(x)=1$. Since $\\overline{\\mbox{kernel}(f)}=X$, there exists a sequence $(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ in $\\mbox{kernel}(f)$ such that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n= x$. It follows that, if $f$ were continuous, we would have $\\displaystyle 1=f(x)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}0=0$. So, $f$ is not continuous.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original question on Math Stack Exchange. The title mentions that a function f is discontinuous if and only if its kernel is dense in X. The question specifies that X is a normed space and f is a non-zero linear functional. The user has already proven one direction (discontinuous implies kernel is dense) and is asking for help with the converse (kernel dense implies discontinuous). \n\nSo, the assumptions should include each condition given. The problem states that X is a normed space, which is one assumption. Then, f is a non-zero linear functional on X, which is another. The user is trying to prove the equivalence, but since they already did one direction, the problem part should be to prove that if the kernel is dense, then f is discontinuous. Wait, the original problem is to show the equivalence, but the user's specific question is about the converse. However, the user might have structured the problem as needing to prove both directions. But in the example provided, the assumption included a specific condition (n divisible by 7) even though the original problem didn't mention that. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed the assumption to n being divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example: The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem changed the assumption to n being an integer and n divisible by 7. But 91 is 7×13, so maybe the original problem had a mistake, or the example was modified. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the example is not accurate, but the user wants me to follow the format. The key is that each assumption should list one property applied to one object.\n\nLooking back at the current problem: The user states that X is a normed space, f is a non-zero linear functional. The equivalence to prove is f discontinuous iff kernel(f) is dense. The user has proved the forward direction and needs the reverse. So the problem as stated is to prove the equivalence. But perhaps in the formatted version, since the user is asking for the converse, maybe the problem part should focus on that. However, the example given includes the entire problem, not splitting into parts. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem includes an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a misunderstanding in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to filter out unnecessary information. Wait, the original example's problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is wrong, but the instruction says to follow the format.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is to prove the equivalence. The user has done one direction and needs the other. But according to the example, perhaps the formatted problem should include all the assumptions. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Let X be a normed space and f be a non-zero linear functional on X. Then prove that f is discontinuous ⇔ kernel(f) is dense in X.\" The user has proved that if f is discontinuous, then kernel(f) is dense, and asks for the converse: if kernel(f) is dense, then f is discontinuous.\n\nSo, the problem as given is to prove an equivalence, but the user is stuck on one direction. However, when structuring the problem, we need to present the entire problem, not just the part the user is stuck on. Wait, but the example given seems to have modified the original problem. The original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was a bad example. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions should list all conditions given in the problem. In the current problem, the assumptions are X is a normed space, f is a non-zero linear functional on X. The problem is to prove the equivalence. But the user's specific question is about the converse. However, according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the example. The example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean the assumption should just be n is an integer, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. So maybe the example is incorrect. But perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo, but in any case, I should focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem: The problem is to prove that f is discontinuous ⇨ kernel dense, and conversely. The user has done the first part and needs the second. But when structuring the problem, we need to present the entire problem as per the original, then the user can ask about their specific part. But the example included an added assumption. However, in this case, the original problem states that X is a normed space and f is a non-zero linear functional. So the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption: X is a normed space,\n\nAssumption: f is a non-zero linear functional on X.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nBut the user's question is about the converse direction. However, according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the original, filtering unrelated information. So I think the formatted problem should include the full original problem, not the user's progress. So the problem part should be: Prove that f is discontinuous if and only if kernel(f) is dense in X.\n\nBut the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. That might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps in the example, the user intended to modify the problem. But since the instructions say to filter unrelated information, perhaps in the original problem, some conditions were implied. But in the current problem, the original problem clearly states X is a normed space and f is a non-zero linear functional on X, so those are the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: X is a normed space,\n\nAssumption: f is a non-zero linear functional on X.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is discontinuous if and only if kernel(f) is dense in X.\n\nBut the user mentions that they have proved one direction. However, the task is to structure the original problem, not the user's progress. So regardless of the user's progress, the problem should be presented as the original. Hence, the formatted problem should include all given assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption: X is a normed space,\n\nAssumption: f is a non-zero linear functional on X.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is discontinuous if and only if kernel(f) is dense in X.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were split into separate lines, each addressing one property. Here, the assumptions are two separate conditions: X being a normed space, and f being a non-zero linear functional. So each should be a separate line.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object. So X is a normed space (one assumption), f is a non-zero linear functional on X (second assumption). The problem is to prove the equivalence.",
