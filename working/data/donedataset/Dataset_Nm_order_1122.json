    "Content": "Let $x_1,x_2, \\ldots$ be a sequence of points of the product space $\\prod X_\\alpha$. Show that the sequence converges to the point $x$ if and only if the sequence $\\pi_\\alpha (x_1), \\pi_\\alpha (x_2)\\ldots$ converges to $\\pi_\\alpha (x)$ for each $\\alpha$. Is this fact true for box topology instead of product topology? But what does it mean to converge in product topology? Is it that a common neighborhood exists for all points in the sequence?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $U\\subseteq X_\\alpha$ be an open neighbourhood of $\\pi_\\alpha(x)$. \nBy definition of product topology, the set $V:=\\prod U_i\\subseteq \\prod X_i$ with $U_\\alpha=U$ and $U_i=X_i$ for $i\\ne \\alpha$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$. Hence almost all $x_n$ are in $V$, hence almost all $\\pi_\\alpha(x_n)$ are in $U$. This just says that $\\pi_\\alpha(x_n)\\to \\pi_\\alpha(x)$. For the other direction suppose that $\\pi_\\alpha(x_n)\\to \\pi_\\alpha(x)$ for all $\\alpha$.\nLet $U$ be an open neighbourgood of $x$.\nWlog. we may assume that $U$ is the product of open sets $U_\\alpha$ of $X_\\alpha$ where $U_\\alpha=X_\\alpha$ for almost all  $\\alpha$ (as these special sets form a basis of the product topology).\nThen for each $\\alpha$, we have that almost all $\\pi_\\alpha(x_n)$ are in $U_\\alpha$, that is there are $n_\\alpha\\in\\mathbb N$ such that $\\pi_\\alpha(x_n)\\in U_\\alpha$ for all $n>n_\\alpha$.\nSince $U_\\alpha=X_\\alpha$ for almost all $\\alpha$, we can choose $n_\\alpha=0$ for almost all $\\alpha$. Therefore we can consider $N=\\max\\{n_\\alpha\\mid \\alpha\\}=\\max\\{n_\\alpha\\mid U_\\alpha=X_\\alpha\\}\\in\\mathbb N$ because we are taking the maximum only over finitely many natural numbers . \nThen for $n>N$ we have that $\\pi_\\alpha(x_n)\\in U_\\alpha$ and hence $x_n\\in U$.\nThis shows that $x_n\\to x$. With box topology, the above argument fails at the bolded step.\nMore concretely, note under the box topology the product of infinitely many discrete two-point spaces is discrete and find an explicite counterexample from that.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. Let me start by understanding the original question thoroughly.\n\nThe title is \"Convergence in product topology\". The question has two main parts. First, it asks to show that a sequence in the product space converges to a point x if and only if the projections of the sequence onto each coordinate α converge to the projection of x. Second, it asks whether this fact holds if we use the box topology instead of the product topology. Additionally, the user is confused about what convergence in the product topology means, specifically whether it requires a common neighborhood for all points in the sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions a sequence x_1, x_2, ... in the product space ∏X_α. The main objects here are the product space, the sequence, and the projections π_α. The key conditions are about convergence in the product topology versus coordinate-wise convergence.\n\nThe problem statement has two parts: the equivalence of convergence in product topology with coordinate-wise convergence, and the question about box topology. But according to the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So for the first part, the assumptions would be that we're working in the product topology, that we have a sequence in the product space, and that the projections are considered for each α.\n\nFor the second part, the assumption would be changing the topology to box topology and asking if the same equivalence holds. However, the user also asks about the meaning of convergence in product topology, wondering if it's about a common neighborhood. But the original problem doesn't state this as an assumption; it's more of a clarification question. Since the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem, maybe that last question is just part of the user's confusion and not part of the formal problem. So perhaps it's not part of the assumptions but part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original question is: \"Show that the sequence converges to the point x if and only if the sequence πα(x1), πα(x2)… converges to πα(x) for each α. Is this fact true for box topology instead of product topology? But what does it mean to converge in product topology? Is it that a common neighborhood exists for all points in the sequence?\"\n\nSo the problem has two explicit parts: the equivalence in product topology, and the question about box topology. The other questions are about the definition of convergence in product topology. But the example given in the user's instruction shows that the formatted problem includes only the problem statement, not the side questions. However, in the example, the original problem mentions proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem includes the assumption that n is divisible by 7 (which was actually part of the problem's hidden assumption, perhaps a mistake in the example). Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. But perhaps the user wants the assumptions to include all given conditions. Wait, in the example, maybe the user made a mistake. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is incorrect. That suggests there might be an error in the example. Therefore, I need to be careful here. Perhaps the example is not correct, but the instruction says to follow the format.\n\nSo, back to the current problem. The task is to structure the problem as per the format, listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem.\n\nThe problem has a sequence in the product space, which is given. The product space has the product topology. The projections are the coordinate maps. The problem is to show the equivalence between convergence in product topology and convergence in each coordinate. Then the second part is whether this holds for box topology.\n\nSo assumptions would include:\n\n- The space considered is a product space with product topology.\n\n- There is a sequence of points in this product space.\n\n- The projections are the natural coordinate projections.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is:\n\n\"Show that the sequence converges to x iff for each α, the projected sequences converge to πα(x). Is this true for box topology?\"\n\nSo the assumptions need to list each condition. Let me parse:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The space is the product space ∏X_α with the product topology.\n\n2. The sequence x_1, x_2, ... is a sequence of points in this product space.\n\n3. For each α, π_α is the projection map from the product space to X_α.\n\nThen the problem is to show the equivalence. Then the second question is whether this holds if the topology is box instead of product.\n\nAdditionally, the user asks about the meaning of convergence in product topology, but that seems like a separate question. However, since the task is to filter unrelated information, maybe those last two sentences (\"But what does it mean...\") are part of the problem statement. Wait, in the original question, the user wrote:\n\n\"Show that the sequence converges to the point x if and only if the sequence π_α(x1), π_α(x2)... converges to π_α(x) for each α. Is this fact true for box topology instead of product topology? But what does it mean to converge in product topology? Is it that a common neighborhood exists for all points in the sequence?\"\n\nSo the problem as posed includes three questions:\n\n1. Prove the equivalence in product topology.\n\n2. Is the equivalence true for box topology?\n\n3. What does convergence in product topology mean? Specifically, is it about a common neighborhood?\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be structured into Assumption and Problem. The example included in the assumption a condition that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which was probably a mistake. But perhaps the user wants all given conditions as assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The space is a product space ∏X_α with the product topology.\n\n- x_1, x_2, ... is a sequence in this product space.\n\n- x is a point in the product space.\n\n- For each α, π_α is the projection map.\n\nThen the problem is to show the sequence converges to x iff each projection converges. Then ask if this holds for box topology. The additional questions about the meaning of convergence might be considered part of the problem, but perhaps they are clarifying and should be excluded as they are part of the user's confusion, not the actual problem. The original problem on Math Stack Exchange is asking to prove the equivalence and then ask about the box topology. The other questions are the user's own confusion, so perhaps they should be filtered out as unrelated.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So I need to identify the core problem, removing any unrelated parts. The original question's core is:\n\n1. Show that in product topology, sequence converges to x iff each coordinate converges.\n\n2. Is this true for box topology?\n\nThe additional questions \"But what does it mean to converge in product topology? Is it that a common neighborhood exists for all points in the sequence?\" are the user's own questions seeking clarification, so they should be filtered out. Hence, the structured problem should only include the first two parts.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The product space ∏X_α is equipped with the product topology.\n\n- x_1, x_2, ... is a sequence in ∏X_α.\n\n- x is a point in ∏X_α.\n\n- For each index α, π_α: ∏X_α → X_α is the projection map.\n\nThe problem is to show the equivalence of convergence in the product topology with coordinate-wise convergence, and then to determine if this holds for the box topology.\n\nBut the example in the user's instruction lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe space under consideration is the product space ∏X_α with the product topology,\n\nx₁, x₂, … is a sequence of points in ∏X_α,\n\nx is a point in ∏X_α,\n\nFor each α, π_α denotes the projection map from ∏X_α to X_α,\n\nThe problem is to show the sequence converges to x in the product topology if and only if π_α(x_i) converges to π_α(x) for each α,\n\nThe problem also asks whether the same holds when the product topology is replaced by the box topology.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each as a separate condition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\nThe space is a product space ∏X_α equipped with the product topology,\n\nx₁, x₂, … is a sequence in ∏X_α,\n\nx is a point in ∏X_α,\n\nFor each α, π_α: ∏X_α → X_α is the projection,\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that the sequence converges to x if and only if for each α, the sequence π_α(x₁), π_α(x₂), … converges to π_α(x). Determine if this statement holds when the product topology is replaced by the box topology.\n\nYes, that seems right. The original problem includes both parts: the equivalence and the box topology question. The user's additional questions about the meaning are their own confusion and should be filtered out as per instructions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe space under consideration is the product space $\\prod X_\\alpha$ equipped with the product topology,\n\n$x_1, x_2, \\ldots$ is a sequence in $\\prod X_\\alpha$,\n\n$x$ is a point in $\\prod X_\\alpha$,\n\nFor each $\\alpha$, $\\pi_\\alpha: \\prod X_\\alpha \\to X_\\alpha$ is the projection map,\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that the sequence converges to $x$ if and only if the sequence $\\pi_\\alpha(x_1), \\pi_\\alpha(x_2), \\ldots$ converges to $\\pi_\\alpha(x)$ for each $\\alpha$.
