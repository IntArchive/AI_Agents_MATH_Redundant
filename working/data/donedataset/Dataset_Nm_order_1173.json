    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the task is to show that the sum of g(k/2015) from k=1 to 2014 is an integer, where g(t) = 3^t / (3^t + 3^(1/2). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the function g(t). Let's write it out again: g(t) = 3^t / (3^t + 3^(1/2). Maybe I can simplify this expression. Let's see, both the numerator and denominator have 3^t and 3^(1/2). Perhaps there's a substitution or identity that can make this easier.\n\nAnother thought: since the argument of g is k/2015, and the sum goes from k=1 to 2014, which is one less than 2015. That makes me think of pairs like k and 2015 - k. For example, if I take k and 2015 - k, their fractions add up to 1. So maybe there's a symmetry here. Let's check if g(k/2015) and g((2015 - k)/2015) have some relationship.\n\nLet me compute g(1 - t). Let t = k/2015, so 1 - t = (2015 - k)/2015. Then:\n\ng(1 - t) = 3^(1 - t) / (3^(1 - t) + 3^(1/2)).\n\nLet's compute this. 3^(1 - t) = 3 * 3^{-t} = 3 / 3^t. So substituting back:\n\ng(1 - t) = (3 / 3^t) / (3 / 3^t + 3^{1/2}).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 3^t to eliminate the denominator in the terms:\n\nNumerator: 3\nDenominator: 3 + 3^{t + 1/2}\n\nSo g(1 - t) = 3 / (3 + 3^{t + 1/2}).\n\nCompare this to the original g(t):\n\ng(t) = 3^t / (3^t + 3^{1/2}).\n\nHmm, is there a way to relate g(t) + g(1 - t)? Let's compute that:\n\ng(t) + g(1 - t) = [3^t / (3^t + 3^{1/2})] + [3 / (3 + 3^{t + 1/2})]\n\nLet me try to simplify this sum. Let's denote x = 3^{t - 1/2}, so that 3^t = 3^{1/2} * x. Then:\n\nFirst term: (3^{1/2} * x) / (3^{1/2} * x + 3^{1/2}) = (x) / (x + 1)\n\nSecond term: 3 / (3 + 3^{1/2} * x) = 3 / [3^{1/2}(3^{1/2} + x)] = (3 / 3^{1/2}) / (3^{1/2} + x) = 3^{1/2} / (3^{1/2} + x)\n\nSo adding the two terms: [x / (x + 1)] + [3^{1/2} / (x + 3^{1/2})]\n\nWait, but x was defined as 3^{t - 1/2}, so maybe this substitution complicates things. Let me check if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let's factor 3^{1/2} from the denominators:\n\nFirst term: 3^t / [3^{1/2}(3^{t - 1/2} + 1)] = [3^{t - 1/2} ] / [3^{t - 1/2} + 1]\n\nSecond term: 3 / [3 + 3^{t + 1/2}] = 3 / [3^{1/2}(3^{1 - 1/2} + 3^{t})] = 3^{1 - 1/2} / [3^{1 - 1/2} + 3^{t}]\n\nWait, 3^{1 - 1/2} is 3^{1/2}. So the second term becomes 3^{1/2} / (3^{1/2} + 3^{t})\n\nBut then if we denote y = 3^{t - 1/2}, then 3^{t} = 3^{1/2} * y. Then the first term is y / (y + 1), and the second term is 3^{1/2} / (3^{1/2} + 3^{1/2} * y) = 1 / (1 + y)\n\nSo then g(t) + g(1 - t) = y/(y + 1) + 1/(1 + y) = (y + 1)/(y + 1) = 1.\n\nOh! So that's a key insight. For any t, g(t) + g(1 - t) = 1. Therefore, when we pair the terms k and 2015 - k in the sum, each pair adds up to 1. Since the sum is from k=1 to k=2014, which is an even number of terms (2014 terms). Wait, 2014 is even? 2014 divided by 2 is 1007. So there are 1007 pairs. Each pair sums to 1, so the total sum is 1007 * 1 = 1007, which is an integer. Hence, the sum is 1007, which is clearly an integer. Therefore, the problem is solved by recognizing the symmetry and the pairing of terms.\n\nWait, let me check again. If the sum is from 1 to 2014, that's 2014 terms. When we pair k and 2015 - k, since 2015 is odd, 2015 - k is from 2014 down to 1. So each pair is unique. For example, when k=1, pair with 2014; k=2, pair with 2013; etc. Since 2014 is even, the total number of pairs is 2014 / 2 = 1007. Each pair sums to 1, so total sum is 1007. Therefore, the sum is 1007, which is an integer. Therefore, the conclusion follows.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention that 2015 is an odd number. Wait, but 2015 is given as the denominator, so 2015 is a specific number. Let me check: 2015 divided by 5 is 403, which is 5*403=2015. So 2015 is 5*403. But regardless, the key point is that when you pair k and 2015 -k, their fractions add up to 1, and the sum of their g(t) is 1. So the total sum is 2014/2 = 1007, which is an integer. Therefore, the sum is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved by recognizing the symmetry in the function g(t) leading to paired terms summing to 1, resulting in an integer total.",
