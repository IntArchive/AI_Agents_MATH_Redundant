    "Content": "Let $X'$ be strict convex, i.e. for all $x_1',x_2'\\in X'$ with $\\|x_1'\\|_{X'}=\\|x_2'\\|_{X'}=1$ the implication $$\\left\\|\\frac{x_1'+x_2'}{2}\\right\\|=1\\Rightarrow x_1'=x_2'$$\nholds. In this case the Hahn-Banach-extension is unique. I am trying to figure out how I can show this. The Hahn-Banach theorem says that for a subspace $U\\subset X$ of a normed space $X$, there exists an extension $x'\\in X'$ with $x'|_U=u'$ for every map $u':U\\to \\mathbb C$. I've already gone through the proof of the Hahn-Banach theorem, but I don't see where I have to use the convexity of $X'$ to show that the extension is unique. Can anyone help me here? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I would like to use slightly different notations. Suppose $h \\in U'$ have distinct Hahn-Banach extensions $f$ and $g$. Then $f_1 = \\dfrac{f}{||h||}, g_1 = \\dfrac{g}{||h||} \\in S_{X'}, f_1 \\neq g_1$, where $S_{X'}$ is the unit sphere in $X'$. By strict convexity of $X'$, \n$$\n\\bigg|\\bigg|\\frac{f_1 + g_1}{2}\\bigg|\\bigg| < 1,\n$$\nand it follows that $||f + g|| < 2||h||$. However, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n||f + g|| &= \\sup_{x \\in X, ||x|| = 1} | f(x) + g(x) | \\\\\n &\\geq \\sup_{x \\in U, ||x|| = 1} | f(x) + g(x) | \\\\\n &= 2\\sup_{x \\in U, ||x|| = 1} |h(x)|\\\\\n &= 2||h||,\n\\end{align*}\na contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about showing that in a strictly convex dual space X', the Hahn-Banach extension is unique. The user mentioned that they've looked at the proof of the Hahn-Banach theorem but didn't see where strict convexity comes into play. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A strictly convex space (also known as rotund) is one where every point on the unit sphere is an extreme point. That means, if the norm of the average of two points is 1, then the two points must be the same. The condition given in the problem is exactly that: if ||x₁' + x₂'||/2 = 1, then x₁' = x₂', provided both have norm 1.\n\nNow, the Hahn-Banach theorem states that any bounded linear functional defined on a subspace can be extended to the whole space without increasing its norm. The part about uniqueness is not generally true unless some conditions on the space are imposed, like strict convexity here.\n\nSo the user wants to connect strict convexity of X' to the uniqueness of the extension. Let me think about how extensions can be non-unique. If there are two different extensions with the same norm, then strict convexity might prevent that.\n\nSuppose we have two extensions x₁' and x₂' of the same functional u' from U to X. Both have the same norm as u' because Hahn-Banach preserves the norm. Let's say the norm of u' is 1 for simplicity. Then both x₁' and x₂' have norm 1. If X' is strictly convex, then if (x₁' + x₂')/2 also has norm 1, then x₁' must equal x₂'. Therefore, if we can show that the average of two extensions is also an extension with the same norm, then strict convexity would force them to be equal.\n\nWait, but are the averages of two extensions also extensions? The original functional on U is linear, so if x₁' and x₂' both agree on U, then their average would also agree on U. So (x₁' + x₂')/2 restricted to U is u'. Also, the norm of the average is less than or equal to the average of the norms, which would be 1. But if X' is strictly convex, unless x₁' = x₂', the norm of the average would be less than 1. But since the extension must have norm 1 (because Hahn-Banach requires the extension to have the same norm), the average would have to have norm 1, which by strict convexity implies x₁' = x₂'.\n\nTherefore, the key is that if there are two distinct extensions, their average would be another extension, but with a norm strictly less than 1, contradicting the Hahn-Banach theorem's norm preservation. Wait, but the average is still an extension, but maybe its norm isn't necessarily preserved? Wait, no. The original extensions have norm 1, so the average has norm ≤ 1. But if the space is strictly convex, then unless they are equal, the norm of the average is strictly less than 1. But the Hahn-Banach theorem requires that the extension has the same norm as the original functional. If the average is an extension, then it must also have norm 1. But if the average's norm is less than 1, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the only possibility is that the two extensions are the same.\n\nSo putting this together, the strict convexity ensures that any two distinct extensions would average to a functional with a lower norm, which can't happen because the Hahn-Banach extension must preserve the norm. Hence, uniqueness follows.\n\nTherefore, in the problem, the strict convexity of X' is used to show that any two norm-preserving extensions must coincide. The key step is considering the average of two supposed extensions and using the strict convexity condition to derive a contradiction unless they are equal.",
