    "Content": "Related question asked by me on MathOverflow: How to prove $e^x\\left|\\int_x^{x+1}\\sin(e^t) \\,\\mathrm d t\\right|\\le 1.4$ ? This is a follow-up question to the question How to prove $ \\mathrm{e}^x\\left|\\int_x^{x+1}\\sin\\mathrm e^t \\mathrm d t\\right|\\leqslant 2$ ? , in which a weaker bound is proven using a nice trick. Now my question is how to maximize and minimize $$f(x)=e^x\\int_x^{x+1}\\sin(e^t) \\,\\mathrm d t$$ or at least to prove $-1.4\\le f(x)\\le 1.4$ . Some observations, using the substitution $y=e^t$ : $$f(x)=e^x \\int_{e^x}^{e^{x+1}} \\frac{\\sin(y)}y\\,\\mathrm dy=g(e^x),$$ where I have defined $$g(z)=z \\int_z^{e z} \\frac{\\sin(y)}y\\,\\mathrm dy = z (\\operatorname{Si}(e z)-\\operatorname{Si}(z)).$$ ( $\\operatorname{Si}$ is the Sine integral .) So the question reduces to: What are the maxima/minima of $g(z)$ for $z\\geq 0$ ? Using the series of $\\mathrm{Si}(z)$ , we get $$g(z)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1} \\frac{z^{2k}(e^{2k-1}-1)}{(2k-1)!\\cdot(2k-1)}$$ and here is a plot of $g(z)$ , which seems to be periodic:",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By the result of [1], we have $$\\left|\\mathrm{Si}(y) - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right| \\le \\frac{1}{y}, \\ y > 0.\\tag{1}$$ Thus, we have, for $z > 0$ , $$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{z} \\le \\mathrm{Si}(z) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{1}{z}$$ and $$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}z} \\le \\mathrm{Si}(\\mathrm{e}z) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}z}.$$ Thus, we have, for $z > 0$ , $$-1 - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}} \\le z(\\mathrm{Si}(\\mathrm{e}z) - \\mathrm{Si}(z)) \\le 1 + \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}}.$$ Also, $1 + \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}} \\approx 1.367879441$ . We are done.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, listing all assumptions line by line and then the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The title is \"How to prove $e^x\\left|\\int_x^{x+1}\\sin(e^t) \\,\\mathrm{d} t\\right|\\le 1.4$?\" and the user mentions wanting to prove that $-1.4 \\le f(x) \\le 1.4$ where $f(x) = e^x \\int_x^{x+1} \\sin(e^t) \\,\\mathrm{d}t$. \n\nThe user then transforms the integral using substitution $y = e^t$, leading to $f(x) = g(e^x)$ where $g(z) = z (\\operatorname{Si}(ez) - \\operatorname{Si}(z))$. The problem then reduces to finding the maxima and minima of $g(z)$ for $z \\geq 0$. \n\nNow, to list the assumptions. The problem states that $z \\geq 0$, so that's one assumption. Also, the function $g(z)$ is defined in terms of the Sine integral function, which is an established mathematical function, so maybe that's a given and not an assumption. However, the substitution $y = e^t$ leads to the integral bounds from $e^x$ to $e^{x+1}$, which translates to $z$ to $ez$ when $z = e^x$. Since $x$ is a real number, $z$ would be positive because $e^x > 0$ for all real $x$. Therefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. $x$ is a real number (since the integral is from $x$ to $x+1$, which makes sense if $x$ is real).\n2. The substitution $y = e^t$ is valid, which requires $t$ to be in the domain where $e^t$ is defined, which it always is here.\n3. $z = e^x$, hence $z > 0$ because the exponential function is always positive.\n4. The function $g(z)$ is defined using the Sine integral function, which is assumed to be well-defined for $z > 0$.\n\nBut the problem as restructured in the example only includes essential assumptions. The original problem's key conditions are that $x$ is such that $z = e^x$ is positive, which it always is. However, maybe the main assumption is just that $z \\geq 0$, but since $z = e^x$, $z$ is always positive. Wait, the user says \"for $z \\geq 0$\", but in reality, $z$ is $e^x$, so $z > 0$. However, the problem statement might have extended $g(z)$ to $z \\geq 0$ by continuity, considering the limit as $z \\to 0^+$. So perhaps the assumption is $z \\geq 0$.\n\nLooking at the example provided earlier, the assumptions were about the variable in the problem. Here, the problem is transformed into studying $g(z)$, so the assumptions should be about $z$. Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $z$ is a non-negative real number.\n- The function $g(z)$ is defined as $z (\\operatorname{Si}(ez) - \\operatorname{Si}(z))$, where $\\operatorname{Si}$ is the Sine integral function.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n$z$ is a non-negative real number,\n$g(z) = z (\\operatorname{Si}(ez) - \\operatorname{Si}(z))$,\n$\\operatorname{Si}$ denotes the Sine integral function.\n\nBut the problem statement in the example includes the function definition as part of the problem. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91, and the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the assumptions are about the variables and any conditions they must satisfy.\n\nHere, the problem is to find the maxima/minima of $g(z)$ for $z \\geq 0$, so the main assumption is that $z$ is non-negative. The definition of $g(z)$ using the Sine integral is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the correct assumption is just that $z \\geq 0$.\n\nWait, but the user in their problem statement says \"how to maximize and minimize $f(x)$ [...] or at least to prove $-1.4 \\le f(x) \\le 1.4$\". However, after substitution, it's transformed into studying $g(z)$, so the problem is about $g(z)$. The original problem mentions $x$ being a real number, but through substitution, $z = e^x$ which is positive, but the user then says \"for $z \\geq 0$\". However, $z = e^x$ implies $z > 0$, but perhaps the problem is extended to $z=0$ by taking the limit. Therefore, the key assumption is $z \\geq 0$.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- $z$ is a non-negative real number.\n\nBut the original function $f(x)$ is defined for all real $x$, which translates to $z > 0$, but the problem statement now is about $g(z)$ for $z \\geq 0$. So maybe the assumption is $z \\geq 0$, and the problem is to find the maxima/minima of $g(z)$ under that condition.\n\nTherefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n$z$ is a non-negative real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the maxima and minima of $g(z) = z (\\operatorname{Si}(ez) - \\operatorname{Si}(z))$ satisfy $-1.4 \\leq g(z) \\leq 1.4$.\n\nAlternatively, the original problem was to prove $|f(x)| \\leq 1.4$, which after substitution is equivalent to $|g(z)| \\leq 1.4$ for $z > 0$. But the user mentions reducing to $z \\geq 0$, so maybe including $z \\geq 0$ as the domain. Therefore, the assumptions and problem should be structured accordingly.\n\nAnother point: In the example, assumptions were listed as specific conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the key condition is $z \\geq 0$. Additionally, the definition of $g(z)$ using the Sine integral is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the problem is to analyze $g(z)$ as defined, under the assumption that $z$ is non-negative.\n\nSo, final answer would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$z$ is a non-negative real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $-1.4 \\leq g(z) \\leq 1.4$ where $$g(z) = z \\left( \\operatorname{Si}(ez) - \\operatorname{Si}(z) \\right)$$ and $\\operatorname{Si}$ is the Sine integral function.\n\nBut checking the original problem, the user wants to prove $e^x |\\int_x^{x+1} \\sin(e^t) dt| \\le 1.4$, which translates to $|g(z)| \\le 1.4$ with $z = e^x > 0$. But since $z = e^x$ is always positive, the problem is equivalent to proving $|g(z)| \\le 1.4$ for all $z > 0$. However, the user later mentions $z \\geq 0$, perhaps considering the limit as $z \\to 0^+$. So the assumption is $z \\geq 0$.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption that $z$ is non-negative, and the problem is to prove the inequality for $g(z)$.",
