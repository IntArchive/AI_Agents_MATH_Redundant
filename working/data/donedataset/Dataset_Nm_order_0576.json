    "Content": "Once upon a time I proved that there is no functorial 'association'\n$$F:\\ \\mathbf{Grp}\\ \\longrightarrow\\ \\mathbf{Grp}:\\ G\\ \\longmapsto\\ \\operatorname{Aut}(G).$$\nA few days ago I casually mentioned this to someone, and was asked for a proof. Unfortunately I could not and still can not recall how I proved it. Here is how much of my proof I do recall: Suppose such a functor does exist. Choose some group $G$ wisely, and let $f\\in\\operatorname{Hom}(V_4,G)$ and $g\\in\\operatorname{Hom}(G,V_4)$ be such that $g\\circ f=\\operatorname{id}_{V_4}$. Then, because $F$ is a co- or contravariant functor we have\n$$F(g)\\circ F(f)=F(g\\circ f)=F(\\operatorname{id}_{V_4})=\\operatorname{id}_{\\operatorname{Aut}(V_4)},$$\nor\n$$F(f)\\circ F(g)=F(g\\circ f)=F(\\operatorname{id}_{V_4})=\\operatorname{id}_{\\operatorname{Aut}(V_4)},$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{Aut}(V_4)\\cong S_3$. In particular $\\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $S_3$. Then something about the order of $\\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ leads to a contradiction. I cannot for the life of me find which goup $G$ would do the trick. Any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Though the question has effectively been answered by the combined comments of Martin Brandenburg and Derek Holt, I thought I'd write up a complete answer for completeness' sake.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that taking the automorphism group of a group isn't functorial. The user mentioned they tried to do this by constructing a contradiction using a specific group G, likely V4 (the Klein four-group) since Aut(V4) is isomorphic to S3. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. There exists a functor F: Grp → Grp that maps each group G to Aut(G).\n2. F is either covariant or contravariant.\n3. Choose a group G such that there are morphisms f: V4 → G and g: G → V4 with g∘f = id_{V4}.\n4. Aut(V4) is isomorphic to S3.\n5. Applying F to these morphisms would lead to F(g)∘F(f) or F(f)∘F(g) being the identity on Aut(V4), implying Aut(G) has a subgroup isomorphic to S3.\n6. The order of Aut(G) leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a functor F doesn't exist. So the problem statement would be the original claim. The assumptions are the setup leading to the contradiction. The user is missing which group G to use. The example in the original problem used V4, so maybe G is V4? Wait, no, because the morphisms are between V4 and G. Maybe G is a group where Aut(G) can't have S3 as a subgroup, but when you use these morphisms, you force it, leading to a contradiction. The classic example here is using G = V4 and then considering the automorphism group, but since Aut(V4) is S3, perhaps choosing G such that Aut(G) has a certain order that can't contain S3. Wait, the user's partial proof mentions that Aut(V4) is S3, and then Aut(G) must contain a subgroup isomorphic to S3. If G is chosen such that Aut(G) has order not divisible by 6, that would contradict S3 (order 6) being a subgroup. For example, if G is a cyclic group of order 3, Aut(G) has order 2, which can't contain S3. But how does V4 map into that? Wait, maybe G is taken as V4 itself? Wait, the problem is that the user is trying to get a contradiction by having Aut(G) contain S3, but maybe for some G, Aut(G) can't have S3. Alternatively, perhaps using G = S3 itself, but then Aut(S3) is trivial? No, Aut(S3) is Inn(S3) which is S3 itself since it's complete. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe using G = C2 × C2 × C2, but Aut of that is GL(3,2) which has order 168, which does contain S3. Maybe a different approach. Wait, the key is that if you have maps f: V4 → G and g: G → V4 such that their composition is the identity on V4, then F(f) and F(g) would compose to the identity on Aut(V4) = S3. But if Aut(G) can't have elements of certain orders, then this is impossible. The classic example here is G = V4, and then using the fact that V4 is abelian but S3 is non-abelian, but that might not be directly applicable. Alternatively, maybe G is a group where Aut(G) is abelian, so it can't contain S3. For instance, if G is an abelian group with Aut(G) abelian. For example, the cyclic group of order 4: Aut(C4) is C2, which is abelian. But can we have maps f: V4 → C4 and g: C4 → V4 such that g∘f is identity? V4 is C2 × C2, which is not a subgroup of C4, since C4 has only one element of order 2. So maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe G is V4 itself. Let me think. If G is V4, then Aut(G) is S3. If we take f and g to be the identity maps, then F would send them to automorphisms, but this doesn't lead to a contradiction. Wait, the original argument was that if you have such a functor, then F(g)∘F(f) must be identity on S3. But if you choose G such that Aut(G) can't have S3 as a subgroup, then this leads to a contradiction. So the key is to pick a G where Aut(G) can't contain S3, but the existence of the maps f and g would force it to. So which G has this property? Maybe G is the cyclic group of order 3. Let's see: Aut(C3) is C2. If we can find maps f: V4 → C3 and g: C3 → V4 such that g∘f is identity on V4. But V4 has elements of order 2, and C3 has elements of order 3. So any homomorphism from V4 to C3 must send elements of order 2 to elements of order dividing 2 and 3, which is only 1. So the only homomorphism is trivial. Similarly, homomorphism from C3 to V4 must be trivial, since V4 has no elements of order 3. Thus, g∘f would be trivial, not identity. So that's not possible. Hmm. Maybe another group. What about the symmetric group S3? Aut(S3) is Inn(S3) ≅ S3. So if G is S3, then Aut(G) is S3. If we can have maps f: V4 → S3 and g: S3 → V4 such that g∘f is identity. But S3 has a normal subgroup of order 3, and V4 is abelian. The image of S3 in V4 would have to be abelian, so the kernel would contain the commutator subgroup, which is A3. So a homomorphism g: S3 → V4 would factor through S3/A3 ≅ C2, so it's possible. Then f: V4 → S3 would need to be an injective homomorphism. But V4 is abelian, and S3 is non-abelian. So any homomorphism from V4 to S3 would have image an abelian subgroup of S3, which is either trivial, C2, or C3. But V4 can't map injectively into S3 since S3 doesn't have a subgroup isomorphic to V4. So f cannot be injective. Therefore, the composition g∘f would not be injective, hence cannot be the identity on V4. So this approach may not work. Wait, the user in their question mentioned choosing G \"wisely\". So maybe the trick is to take G = V4, but then Aut(V4) is S3. If F is a functor, then applying F to the identity map of V4 should give the identity automorphism on S3. But maybe the contradiction comes from some other property. Alternatively, consider the group V4 and another group where the automorphism group can't have S3. Wait, perhaps the group G is the trivial group? But then Aut(trivial) is trivial, but you can't have maps from V4 to trivial group and back. Hmm. Wait, the key is that if you have a retraction and section, i.e., f is a section and g is a retraction, such that g∘f = id. Then F(g)∘F(f) would have to be id, which would mean that Aut(G) has a subgroup isomorphic to S3. But if you can choose G such that Aut(G) is trivial, then that's a contradiction. For example, take G as the cyclic group of order 2. Then Aut(G) is trivial. But can we have maps f: V4 → C2 and g: C2 → V4 such that g∘f is identity? Let's see. Hom(V4, C2): each element of V4 can map to 0 or 1, so there are 4 homomorphisms. Similarly, hom(C2, V4): since V4 has three elements of order 2, there are three non-trivial homomorphisms. Suppose we take f: V4 → C2 as the projection onto one factor, then g: C2 → V4 as inclusion into that factor. Then g∘f would be the endomorphism of V4 that projects onto a C2 and then includes back. But that composition would not be the identity, it would be a projection. So this doesn't work. Hence, maybe the group G is V4 itself. Then, if we take f and g both as identity maps, then F(g∘f)=F(id)=id, but then Aut(G)=S3. But where's the contradiction? The user said that something about the order of Aut(G) leads to a contradiction. Wait, perhaps the contradiction arises when considering that F is supposed to be a functor, but the automorphism group of G is non-trivial, but somehow the structure doesn't preserve functoriality. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the key is to consider that if F is covariant, then F(g)∘F(f) must be id, but if F is contravariant, F(f)∘F(g) must be id. But if Aut(G) doesn't have elements of certain orders, this is impossible. Alternatively, maybe taking G as V4 and another group where the automorphism group can't have S3, but I'm not sure. Wait, the original argument says that Aut(G) contains a subgroup isomorphic to S3, leading to a contradiction based on the order. For example, if G is a group of order not divisible by 6, then Aut(G) can't have a subgroup of order 6. So if G is chosen to be such a group where Aut(G)'s order isn't divisible by 6, but the existence of the maps f and g would imply that S3 is a subgroup of Aut(G), hence 6 divides |Aut(G)|, contradiction. So which group G has this property? Let's see. If G is the cyclic group of order 5, Aut(G) is C4, which has order 4. If we can find f: V4 → C5 and g: C5 → V4 with g∘f=id. But again, homomorphisms from V4 to C5 must be trivial, since C5 has no elements of order 2. Similarly, homomorphisms from C5 to V4 must be trivial. So the composition would be trivial, not identity. So that's not possible. Maybe G is the quaternion group Q8? Aut(Q8) is S4, which does contain S3. So that doesn't help. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps G is the symmetric group S3. Aut(S3) is S3, which is okay, but maybe if we have some other group. Wait, maybe the problem is with the specific maps f and g. For example, if V4 is a direct summand of G, but if G is such that Aut(G) doesn't have S3, then that's a contradiction. The standard example for this proof is taking G to be V4. Wait, in the original argument, the user said that Aut(V4) is S3, and then if you have a functor F, then F would send the identity map of V4 to the identity automorphism of S3, but also, if you have maps f and g such that g∘f is identity on V4, then their images under F must compose to identity. But where is the contradiction? Maybe the key is that such a functor would imply that Aut(G) has certain properties that it can't. Wait, perhaps the group G is V4 itself, and then considering the automorphism group. But then Aut(V4) is S3, which is fine. Maybe the contradiction comes from the fact that if F is a functor, then F must preserve composition, but in reality, Aut doesn't do that. Wait, I think I need to recall the standard proof for this. The standard proof uses that the automorphism group functor isn't functorial because there's no way to make it compatible with both covariance and contravariance. The usual example is to take G = V4 and H = S3, but maybe using the maps between them. Wait, another approach: the center functor Z: Grp → Ab is not functorial, but that's a different story. Wait, but the user is talking about Aut. The standard argument is to consider that if Aut were functorial, then it would send split epis and monos to split epis and monos, leading to contradictions. Alternatively, take the group V4 and a group G where there is a split epi G → V4. Then Aut(G) would have to map onto Aut(V4) = S3, but if Aut(G) is too small, this is impossible. For example, take G = C2 × C2 × C2 × C2, but Aut of that is GL(4,2), which is big. Alternatively, take G = V4 × V4, but Aut of that is larger. Hmm. Wait, maybe the key is to take G = V4. Then, if we have the maps f: V4 → G and g: G → V4 such that g∘f = id, then F(f) and F(g) would have to be homomorphisms between Aut(V4) = S3 and Aut(G). But if G = V4, then Aut(G) is S3. So F(f) and F(g) would be endomorphisms of S3. But then, the composition would have to be the identity. However, unless f and g are isomorphisms, which they aren't necessarily, this could be possible. Wait, but if f is a section and g is a retraction, then G would have to be a semidirect product of V4 with something. But maybe if G is V4 × V4, then you can have a projection and inclusion maps. For example, f: V4 → V4 × V4 as the inclusion into the first factor, and g: V4 × V4 → V4 as the projection onto the first factor. Then g∘f = id. Then F(f): Aut(V4) → Aut(V4 × V4), and F(g): Aut(V4 × V4) → Aut(V4). Then F(g)∘F(f) would be a map from Aut(V4) to itself, which should be the identity. But Aut(V4 × V4) is more complicated (it's the wreath product S3 ≀ S2), and the projection might not split back. This might lead to a contradiction because the image of Aut(V4) in Aut(V4 × V4) under F(f) and then projected back might not be the identity. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the classic example uses that the automorphism group of V4 is S3, and if you have a group G with a nontrivial center, then Aut(G) can't have certain subgroups. But V4 has trivial center? No, V4 is abelian, so its center is itself. Wait, but Aut(V4) is S3, which is centerless. Hmm. I think I'm overcomplicating this. The standard proof for this result is to take G = V4 and H = S3, but I'm not recalling the exact steps. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction comes from the fact that if F is a covariant functor, then the map F(g) ∘ F(f) must be the identity on S3, but if G is chosen such that Aut(G) has no elements of order 3, for example, then this is impossible. For instance, take G = C2. Then Aut(G) is trivial. If you can find maps f: V4 → C2 and g: C2 → V4 such that g∘f = id_{V4}, but as before, such maps don't exist because V4 can't map onto C2 and back in a way that composes to identity. So that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the key is to use the fact that the automorphism group of the trivial group is trivial. But again, the maps to and from the trivial group are limited. Alternatively, consider the group G = V4 ⊕ V4, and then maps f and g as injection and projection. Then Aut(G) is GL(2, Z/2Z) × something, which has order 6*6=36? Not sure. But regardless, this might not lead to a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the automorphism group functor doesn't preserve products, but that's a different issue. Wait, going back to the user's original argument: they have F(g)∘F(f) = id_{Aut(V4)} if F is covariant, or F(f)∘F(g) = id if contravariant. This implies that Aut(G) has a subgroup isomorphic to S3. If G is chosen such that Aut(G) cannot contain S3, then this is a contradiction. So which G has Aut(G) not containing S3? For example, if G is abelian, then Aut(G) is the general linear group over Z, but for certain abelian groups. Take G = C2 × C2 × C2, Aut(G) is GL(3,2) which has order 168, which does contain S3. Hmm. What about G = C5? Aut(G) is C4, which doesn't contain S3. But as before, there's no nontrivial maps between V4 and C5. So that's not useful. Alternatively, take G = S3. Aut(S3) is S3 itself. If we have maps f: V4 → S3 and g: S3 → V4 such that g∘f = id. But as before, V4 can't be a retract of S3 because S3 doesn't have a normal subgroup isomorphic to V4. Hence, no such maps. Therefore, this approach might not work. Wait, maybe the user is recalling an argument where G is taken to be V4 itself. Suppose F is a functor from Grp to Grp sending G to Aut(G). Take the identity map id: V4 → V4. Then F(id) should be the identity automorphism on Aut(V4) = S3. Now, consider the trivial homomorphism f: V4 → V4 sending everything to identity. Then F(f) would be a homomorphism from Aut(V4) = S3 to Aut(V4) = S3. But F(f) must send every automorphism to the identity, which is not a group homomorphism unless Aut(V4) is trivial, which it's not. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. But wait, functors must send identity morphisms to identity morphisms, but if we consider a non-identity morphism, how does it behave? I think I'm mixing things up. The key point is that the automorphism group functor doesn't respect composition of morphisms unless specific conditions are met. The original argument uses the existence of a section and retraction to force a subgroup relation in the automorphism groups, leading to a contradiction when such a subgroup cannot exist. Therefore, the group G must be chosen such that there exist maps f: V4 → G and g: G → V4 with g∘f = id, but Aut(G) doesn't have a subgroup isomorphic to S3. The classic example is G = V4 × V4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe G is a cyclic group, but cyclic groups of order 2 or 4 don't have Aut(G) containing S3. However, as before, there are no nontrivial maps from V4 to cyclic groups of even order that split. Wait, let's think differently. Suppose we take G = V4. Then Aut(G) = S3. Suppose we have an endomorphism f: V4 → V4 which is a projection (like quotienting out one of the C2 factors) and g: V4 → V4 including it back. But then g∘f is the identity. Wait, but in V4, projections aren't really possible unless you decompose it into factors. For example, if V4 = ⟨a, b⟩, then f could be the map sending a to a and b to e, and g could send a to a. Then g∘f would send a to a and b to e, which is not the identity. So this doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe f is the identity and g is the identity, then it's trivial. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look up the standard proof. Wait, according to some references, the argument is that if Aut were functorial, then every surjective group homomorphism would induce a surjective homomorphism on automorphism groups, which is not true. For example, take the quotient map from C4 to C2, which doesn't induce a surjective map Aut(C4) → Aut(C2), since Aut(C4) is C2 and Aut(C2) is trivial. But this example shows that Aut isn't functorial in a covariant way. However, the user's approach is different, using the existence of a section and retract leading to a subgroup contradiction. The key group G in that case is V4 itself, because Aut(V4) is S3, and if you have a group G with a retract V4, then Aut(G) must have a subgroup isomorphic to S3. If G is chosen such that Aut(G) can't contain S3, contradiction. For instance, take G = C3, but as before, maps between V4 and C3 are trivial. So maybe another group. Alternatively, take G = V4 ⊕ C3, but Aut(G) would be Aut(V4) × Aut(C3) = S3 × C2, which does contain S3. Not helpful. Alternatively, take G as a simple group where Aut(G) is small. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is that G should be V4 itself, leading to Aut(G) = S3, and then the contradiction comes from the fact that S3 can't act in a certain way? I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the need to format the problem according to the user's instructions, I'll proceed to list the assumptions based on the user's partial proof and structure the problem accordingly.",
