    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $$\\frac{N_{0}+1}{b}=\\sqrt{2}\\rightarrow (N_{0}+1)^{2}=2b^{2}$$ Obviously $N_{0}+1>b$ or $N_{0} \\geq b$. We can see that $N_{0}+1$ is divisible by 2.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was about proving that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted version listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like maybe the example included an assumption that wasn't explicitly in the original problem? Hmm, maybe the example had a typo or perhaps the original problem had more context. But maybe I should focus on the actual question provided here.\n\nThe current problem to format is from the title \"Irrationality of sqrt 2 using induction\" and the question states: \"I came upon this exercise in a textbook. I know that n/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b > 0 and n ≤ N0. How can I then show that (N0 + 1)/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b > 0?\" \n\nSo, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem. Let's parse this.\n\nFirst, the user knows that for all b > 0 and n ≤ N0, n/b is not equal to sqrt(2). That's given. Then they need to show that (N0 + 1)/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b > 0. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. For all positive real numbers b and integers n ≤ N0, the fraction n/b is not equal to sqrt(2).\n2. N0 is a fixed integer (probably a non-negative integer, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe just integer).\n3. The problem is to show that (N0 + 1)/b is not equal to sqrt(2) for any positive real number b.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the induction context isn't fully clear. The user is trying to use induction on N0, perhaps. So the induction hypothesis is that for all n up to N0, n/b ≠ sqrt(2), and they need to prove it for N0 +1.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include:\n\n- n and b are such that n/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all n ≤ N0 and b > 0.\n- Then, the problem is to prove that (N0 +1)/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b > 0.\n\nSo, when structuring, each assumption should be one line, one property per line.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. For every positive real number $b$ and integer $n$ such that $n \\leq N_0$, the equation $\\frac{n}{b} = \\sqrt{2}$ does not hold.\n2. $N_0$ is an integer.\n\nThen the problem is to show that for every positive real number $b$, the equation $\\frac{N_0 + 1}{b} = \\sqrt{2}$ does not hold.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"I know that n/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b > 0 and n ≤ N0.\" So the first assumption is that for all b > 0 and for all integers n ≤ N0, n/b is not sqrt(2). Then the problem is to show that (N0 +1)/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b >0.\n\nBut the user might have intended to use induction, so perhaps the induction step is to assume the hypothesis holds up to N0 and then prove it for N0 +1. But in the problem statement, the user is directly asking how to show the next step given the previous knowledge.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\n- For every integer $n$ with $n \\leq N_0$ and every positive real number $b$, $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$.\n- $N_0$ is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that for every positive real number $b$, $\\frac{N_0 + 1}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were listed as separate lines. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate lines. So maybe here, the first assumption is about the property of n and b, and the second is about N0 being an integer. However, in the original question, it's possible that N0 is given as an integer, but the problem may not explicitly state that. Let's check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"I know that n/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b > 0 and n ≤ N0. How can I then show that (N0 +1)/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b > 0?\"\n\nIn the original question, n is presumably an integer since they are talking about induction, and induction is typically over integers. So perhaps N0 is an integer, and n is also an integer. But the problem statement as given doesn't explicitly state that n is an integer. Wait, the user wrote \"n ≤ N0\", so maybe n is an integer here. Because otherwise, if n could be any real number ≤ N0, the statement would be different. But given that the context is induction, it's likely that n is an integer. However, the problem statement doesn't specify this. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the problem statement as given by the user on Math Stack Exchange, it's written as: \"I know that $\\frac{n}{b} \\ne \\sqrt{2}$ for all $b \\gt 0$ and $n \\le N_0$.\" So here, n is presumably an integer because they are using induction, and in induction, n would be an integer index. So perhaps we need to include that n is an integer.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. $n$ is an integer.\n2. For every integer $n$ with $n \\leq N_0$ and every positive real number $b$, $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$.\n3. $N_0$ is an integer.\n\nWait, but the problem statement as written in the original question might not state that n is an integer. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"I know that $\\frac{n}{b} \\ne \\sqrt{2}$ for all $b \\gt 0$ and $n \\le N_0$.\" So here, n is being used as a variable that is less than or equal to N0. The fact that they are using induction suggests that n is an integer. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly say so. However, in induction, n is typically an integer. So perhaps the problem assumes n is an integer, but since the user didn't specify, maybe we need to clarify.\n\nBut according to the example given by the user, they added an assumption \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\". But in the example, they also added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the original problem in the example was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted assumption was: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, because the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is not accurate, or maybe there was a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was for a different problem where the user wanted to structure it with additional assumptions. That's confusing. Maybe I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user says: \"I know that n/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b >0 and n ≤ N0. How can I then show that (N0 +1)/b ≠ sqrt(2) for all b >0?\" Given the context is induction, it's implied that N0 is an integer and n is an integer. But if the problem doesn't explicitly state that n and N0 are integers, then maybe we should include that as assumptions. Because otherwise, if n and N0 are real numbers, the induction step doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem correctly, we need to list the assumptions:\n\n1. $n$ is an integer.\n2. $N_0$ is an integer.\n3. For every integer $n$ such that $n \\leq N_0$ and every positive real number $b$, the equation $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$ holds.\n\nProblem: Show that for every positive real number $b$, the equation $\\frac{N_0 + 1}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$ holds.\n\nBut maybe the first assumption can be merged with the third. Wait, the example had each assumption on a separate line. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- $n$ is an integer.\n- $N_0$ is an integer.\n- For every integer $n$ with $n \\leq N_0$ and every positive real number $b$, $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nProblem: Show that for every positive real number $b$, $\\frac{N_0 + 1}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement in the question says \"for all b >0 and n ≤ N0\". So maybe the third assumption is written as:\n\n- For every positive real number $b$ and integer $n$ such that $n \\leq N_0$, the equation $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$ holds.\n\nBut then, the first two assumptions are that n and N0 are integers. However, in the problem statement, the induction step is about proving for n = N0 +1. So perhaps n in the problem is an integer, and N0 is also an integer. So those are separate assumptions.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question might not have explicitly mentioned that n is an integer. Wait, the original question is written as \"n ≤ N0\". If N0 is an integer, and n is being compared to N0 in an induction context, then n is likely an integer.\n\nBut if the problem is presented in a textbook exercise about induction, then it's standard that n is an integer. However, the problem statement might not have stated that explicitly. So to be precise, perhaps the assumptions should include that n and N0 are integers.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $n$ is an integer.\n- $N_0$ is an integer.\n- For every integer $n$ such that $n \\leq N_0$ and every positive real number $b$, $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nProblem: Show that $\\frac{N_0 + 1}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$ for every positive real number $b$.\n\nBut I should check if each assumption is only one property applied to one object. So:\n\n1. \"$n$ is an integer.\" – addresses the property of n.\n2. \"$N_0$ is an integer.\" – addresses the property of N0.\n3. \"For every integer $n$ such that $n \\leq N_0$ and every positive real number $b$, $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$.\" – this is a condition applied to n and b.\n\nBut the third assumption involves both n and b, but the example allowed for assumptions that involve multiple objects as long as each addresses one property or condition. Wait, in the example, the assumption was \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", which is a single property of n. The third assumption here is a bit more complex. Maybe it's better to split into two parts? But it's a single condition: for all n ≤ N0 and all b >0, n/b ≠ sqrt(2). Maybe it's acceptable as one line since it's one condition, albeit involving multiple variables.\n\nSo, structuring as per the example, which included an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\" which is a condition on n, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this case, we can have:\n\nAssumption:\n- $n$ is an integer.\n- $N_0$ is an integer.\n- For every positive real number $b$, $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$ whenever $n \\leq N_0$.\n\nProblem: Show that $\\frac{N_0 + 1}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$ for all positive real numbers $b$.\n\nAlternatively, to make each assumption line address one object:\n\n1. $n$ is an integer.\n2. $N_0$ is an integer.\n3. For every integer $n$ with $n \\leq N_0$, $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$ for all $b > 0$.\n\nBut perhaps that's acceptable. Each line is an assumption, even if the third line involves both n and b, it's a single condition applied to both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third assumption is written as:\n\n- For all integers $n$ where $n \\leq N_0$ and all positive real numbers $b$, $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nYes, that's one condition, so it can be a single line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $n$ is an integer.\n- $N_0$ is an integer.\n- For all integers $n \\leq N_0$ and all positive real numbers $b$, $\\frac{n}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\frac{N_0 + 1}{b} \\neq \\sqrt{2}$ for all positive real numbers $b$.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"for all b > 0 and n ≤ N0\", so maybe the order is important. However, in logical terms, \"for all n ≤ N0 and b >0\" is the same as \"for all b >0 and n ≤ N0\". So the order doesn't matter.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct formatting.",
