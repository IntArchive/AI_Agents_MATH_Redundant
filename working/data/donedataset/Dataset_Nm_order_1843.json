    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the question from Math Stack Exchange about why the unit circle has no polynomial parametrization.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem is about the unit circle, so the main object here is the unit circle. The key condition is that there's no polynomial parametrization for it. But wait, the original question doesn't explicitly state any assumptions beyond the unit circle itself. The user is asking how to show that such a parametrization doesn't exist and if there are general criteria for this.\n\nWait, in the example provided, assumptions included conditions on n. But here, maybe the assumptions are implicit. The unit circle is defined by x² + y² = 1. The question is about polynomial parametrization, meaning parametrizing the circle using polynomials in a parameter, say t, such that x(t) and y(t) are polynomials and for all t, x(t)² + y(t)² = 1.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- The unit circle is defined by the equation x² + y² = 1.\n- A polynomial parametrization would require x(t) and y(t) to be polynomials in t.\n- The parametrization must satisfy x(t)² + y(t)² = 1 for all t.\n\nBut the original question doesn't list these; they're part of the problem's context. However, following the example, the user wants the assumptions to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe unit circle is defined by the equation x² + y² = 1.\nA polynomial parametrization would consist of polynomials x(t) and y(t).\nThe parametrization must satisfy x(t)² + y(t)² = 1 for all parameters t.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists no polynomial parametrization of the unit circle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to show that there's no polynomial parametrization, so the assumptions are the properties of the unit circle and the requirements for a polynomial parametrization. Each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo let me structure it step by step:\n\nAssumption:\nThe unit circle is the set of points (x, y) satisfying x² + y² = 1.\nA parametrization of the circle consists of functions x(t) and y(t).\nThe functions x(t) and y(t) are polynomials in t.\nThe equation x(t)² + y(t)² = 1 holds for all t.\n\nProblem:\nProve that no such polynomial parametrization exists.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"the unit circle admits no polynomial parametrization\". So the problem is to show that there's no polynomial parametrization. The assumptions would be the definitions and the conditions required for a polynomial parametrization.\n\nEach assumption line should address one property. So breaking down:\n\n- The unit circle is defined by the equation x² + y² = 1.\n- A parametrization of the circle is given by functions x(t) and y(t).\n- The functions x(t) and y(t) are polynomials in the parameter t.\n- The parametrization satisfies x(t)² + y(t)² = 1 for all t.\n\nBut the user's example had only two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumptions are more about the definitions. Maybe the key is to list the necessary conditions for the problem. The problem is to show that such polynomials x(t) and y(t) don't exist. Therefore, the assumptions are the existence of such polynomials and the unit circle's equation.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem doesn't state assumptions explicitly, so the assistant has to infer them. Let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted version, they listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption in the formatted problem included n is an integer, but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. However, in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. Wait, that example seems off. Wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That might be an error. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption should not include that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake. But the user provided that example, so maybe they have a different approach. Maybe in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. So perhaps the original problem had a mistake, or maybe the user restructured it with an added assumption. Hmm, confusing.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated information. The original question is \"Why is there no polynomial parametrization for the circle? How does one show that the unit circle admits no polynomial parametrization? What is needed for this, are there general criteria?\"\n\nSo the core problem is to show the unit circle has no polynomial parametrization. The assumptions would be the definitions involved. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe unit circle is defined by x² + y² = 1.\nA polynomial parametrization requires x(t) and y(t) to be polynomials in t.\nThe parametrization must satisfy x(t)² + y(t)² = 1 for all t.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists no polynomial parametrization of the unit circle.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just as stated, maybe the assumptions are only the unit circle's equation and the existence of polynomial parametrization. But each assumption line should address one property. Let me make sure each line is one property applied to one object.\n\nAssumption:\nThe unit circle is the set of points (x, y) where x² + y² = 1.\nA parametrization of the circle consists of functions x(t) and y(t).\nThe functions x(t) and y(t) are polynomials in the parameter t.\nThe equation x(t)² + y(t)² = 1 must hold for all values of t.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there is no such polynomial parametrization for the unit circle.\n\nYes, that should cover it. Each line is a separate assumption: definition of the circle, existence of parametrization, polynomials, and the equation holding for all t.",
