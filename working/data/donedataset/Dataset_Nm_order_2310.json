    "AcceptedAnswer": "This isn't too difficult to show directly. Any isometry $f\\colon\\mathbb{S}^n\\to\\mathbb{S}^n$ extends easily to a map $g\\colon\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, (writing $\\hat x\\equiv x/\\Vert x\\Vert\\in\\mathbb{S}^n$ for $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\setminus\\{0\\}$)\n$$\ng(x)=\\begin{cases}\n\\Vert x\\Vert f(\\hat x),&\\textrm{if }x\\not=0,\\cr\n0,&\\textrm{if }x=0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIt is clear that $f$ is the restriction of $g$ to $\\mathbb{S}^n$, so all that needs to be done is to show that $g$ is an isometry. In particular,\n$$\n\\Vert g(x)-g(y)\\Vert=\\Vert x-y\\Vert\\qquad{\\rm(1)}\n$$\nfor $x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\nAlso, $\\Vert g(x)-g(0)\\Vert=\\Vert x\\Vert\\Vert f(\\hat x)\\Vert=\\Vert x\\Vert=\\Vert x-0\\Vert$, so (1) only needs to be shown for nonzero $x,y$. However, the distance between $x,y$ can be written purely in terms of $\\Vert x\\Vert,\\Vert y\\Vert$ and $\\hat x\\cdot\\hat y$,\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\Vert x-y\\Vert^2&=\\Vert x\\Vert^2+\\Vert y\\Vert^2-2x\\cdot y\\cr\n&=\\Vert x\\Vert^2+\\Vert y\\Vert^2-2\\Vert x\\Vert\\Vert y\\Vert\\hat x\\cdot\\hat y.\n\\end{align}\\qquad(2)\n$$\nNow, $g$ preserves the norm of any $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Also, $\\hat x\\cdot\\hat y$ is just the cosine of the distance from $\\hat x$ to $\\hat y$ along the sphere. So, this is preserved by $f$ and, hence, $\\widehat{g(x)}\\cdot\\widehat{g(y)}=f(\\hat x)\\cdot f(\\hat y)=\\hat x\\cdot\\hat y$. Applying (2) to both $\\Vert x-y\\Vert$ and $\\Vert g(x)-g(y)\\Vert$ shows that (1) holds and $g$ is distance preserving. As the (Riemannian) metric is determined by the distance between points (note: if $\\gamma$ is a smooth curve in a manifold $X$, $g(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t))=\\lim_{h\\searrow0}h^{-1}d(\\gamma(t),\\gamma(t+h))$), then as long as it is known that $g$ is smooth, the argument above implies that $g$ is an isometry in the Riemannian sense. It is known that any distance preserving invertible map between $n$-dimensional manifolds is smooth. If you don't want to use such a result, you can instead use the fact that any distance (and origin) preserving map $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is linear (e.g., see this question ), hence smooth.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about proving that an isometry of the n-dimensional sphere, denoted as 𝕊ⁿ, is actually the restriction of an isometry of ℝⁿ⁺¹. The user specified that we should do this without using the concept of geodesics and that the metric on 𝕊ⁿ is the one induced by ℝⁿ⁺¹. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what an isometry is. An isometry is a map that preserves distances. So, if we have a function f: 𝕊ⁿ → 𝕊ⁿ that is an isometry, then for any two points x and y on 𝕊ⁿ, the distance between f(x) and f(y) on the sphere should be the same as the distance between x and y. But here, the metric on 𝕊ⁿ is induced by the ambient space ℝⁿ⁺¹, which means the distance between two points on the sphere is the same as their Euclidean distance in ℝⁿ⁺¹. So, essentially, the distance on 𝕊ⁿ is the restriction of the Euclidean distance from ℝⁿ⁺¹.\n\nNow, the problem is to show that any such isometry of 𝕊ⁿ must come from an isometry of the entire space ℝⁿ⁺¹. That is, if f: 𝕊ⁿ → 𝕊ⁿ is an isometry, then there exists an isometry F: ℝⁿ⁺¹ → ℝⁿ⁺¹ such that F restricted to 𝕊ⁿ is equal to f. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this without using geodesics. Typically, one might use properties of geodesics to show that isometries preserve them and then extend the map, but since that's off-limits, I need another strategy. \n\nMaybe start by considering that the sphere is embedded in ℝⁿ⁺¹. So any isometry of the sphere should preserve the Euclidean distance in ℝⁿ⁺¹ when restricted to the sphere. But how does that help? Perhaps we can extend the isometry from the sphere to the entire space. \n\nIf f is an isometry of 𝕊ⁿ, can we extend it linearly to ℝⁿ⁺¹? For example, in the case of linear isometries (like rotations, reflections), the extension is straightforward because they are already linear maps on ℝⁿ⁺¹. But what if the isometry is not linear? Wait, in Euclidean space, all isometries are affine transformations, composed of translations and linear isometries. However, the sphere is centered at the origin, and translations would move the sphere unless the translation is zero. So, perhaps the isometries of the sphere correspond to linear isometries of ℝⁿ⁺¹ that fix the origin, since translating the sphere would move it away from the origin, which is not allowed because the sphere is defined as the set of points at distance 1 from the origin. \n\nTherefore, the isometries of the sphere should be the linear isometries (orthogonal transformations) of ℝⁿ⁺¹ restricted to the sphere. But the problem states that any isometry of the sphere is the restriction of an isometry of ℝⁿ⁺¹. Wait, but in ℝⁿ⁺¹, isometries include translations as well. However, translations do not preserve the sphere unless they are zero translations. So maybe the isometries of the sphere are exactly the orthogonal transformations restricted to the sphere. \n\nSo, to prove that any isometry f of 𝕊ⁿ (with the induced metric) extends to an isometry F of ℝⁿ⁺¹, we might need to show that f is the restriction of an orthogonal transformation. \n\nLet's consider that the induced metric on 𝕊ⁿ is the chordal metric, which is the Euclidean distance between points. So if f preserves the chordal distance, then it should correspond to an orthogonal transformation. \n\nOrthogonal transformations preserve the inner product. If a map preserves the Euclidean distance on the sphere, does it necessarily preserve the inner product in ℝⁿ⁺¹? Let's recall that in Euclidean space, if a map preserves distances, then it's an isometry (by the Mazur-Ulam theorem, which says that any surjective isometry of a real normed vector space is affine). But here, the map is only defined on the sphere. \n\nWait, but if we have a map f: 𝕊ⁿ → 𝕊ⁿ that preserves the Euclidean distance, then can we extend it to a linear map on ℝⁿ⁺¹? Let's see. For any point x in ℝⁿ⁺¹, we can write x = r·v, where r ≥ 0 and v ∈ 𝕊ⁿ. If we define F(x) = r·f(v), does this work? Let's check if this is an isometry. \n\nTake two points x and y in ℝⁿ⁺¹, write them as x = r·v and y = s·w. Then the distance between F(x) and F(y) is |r·f(v) - s·f(w)|. The original distance is |r·v - s·w|. For F to be an isometry, we need |r·f(v) - s·f(w)| = |r·v - s·w| for all r,s ≥ 0 and v,w ∈ 𝕊ⁿ. \n\nBut this seems non-trivial. For example, take r = s = 1. Then we have |f(v) - f(w)| = |v - w|, which is true because f is an isometry on the sphere. If r ≠ s, does the equality still hold? Suppose r = 2, s = 1. Then |2f(v) - f(w)| should equal |2v - w|. But does this follow from f being an isometry on the sphere? Not obviously. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps f must be linear. Let's assume that f is an isometry of the sphere. Then, if f is linear, it preserves the inner product, because for any v, w ∈ 𝕊ⁿ, we have |f(v) - f(w)|² = |v - w|². Expanding both sides, |f(v)|² + |f(w)|² - 2f(v)·f(w) = |v|² + |w|² - 2v·w. Since |f(v)| = |v| = 1 and similarly for w, this simplifies to 1 + 1 - 2f(v)·f(w) = 1 + 1 - 2v·w, so f(v)·f(w) = v·w. Hence, f preserves the inner product, which implies that f is an orthogonal transformation. \n\nBut wait, this assumes that f is linear. However, we might have a map that's not linear but restricts to an isometry on the sphere. Wait, but if f preserves the inner product on the sphere, then even if it's not linear, when we extend it linearly to all of ℝⁿ⁺¹, it becomes linear and preserves the inner product. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that any isometry of the sphere that preserves the chordal distance (i.e., Euclidean distance) must preserve the inner product. Because as shown earlier, if |f(v) - f(w)| = |v - w|, then their inner product is preserved. Therefore, f preserves the inner product, so it's the restriction of an orthogonal transformation. \n\nTherefore, any isometry of the sphere (with the induced metric) is the restriction of an orthogonal transformation on ℝⁿ⁺¹, which is an isometry of ℝⁿ⁺¹. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Show that an isometry f of 𝕊ⁿ preserves the Euclidean distance between points on 𝕊ⁿ.\n2. Since the metric is induced, preserving the distance on the sphere implies preserving the Euclidean distance in ℝⁿ⁺¹ for points on the sphere.\n3. Show that preserving Euclidean distance between points on the sphere implies that f preserves the inner product.\n4. Therefore, f is the restriction of an orthogonal transformation on ℝⁿ⁺¹, which is an isometry of ℝⁿ⁺¹.\n\nThis approach doesn't use geodesics, so it should satisfy the problem's requirement. The main point is linking the preservation of Euclidean distance on the sphere to the preservation of the inner product, thereby allowing the extension to an orthogonal transformation.",
