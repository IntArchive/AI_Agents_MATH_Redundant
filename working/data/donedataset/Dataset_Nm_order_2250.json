    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure their question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that a certain infinite series sums up to π. Let me start by identifying the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the problem statement is the sum from k=1 to infinity of (3408k² + 1974k -720)/(128k⁶ + 480k⁵ + 680k⁴ + 450k³ + 137k² +15k) equals π. That's the main problem. Now, the user tried to simplify the fraction by factoring out a 6 from the numerator and denominator, leading to a simplified fraction. But the question is where to go from there.\n\nLooking at the assumptions, the problem doesn't state any specific conditions except that the sum is from k=1 to infinity. The user mentions that the denominator factors into (k)(something), but maybe I need to check if there are implicit assumptions here. The denominator polynomial is 128k⁶ + ... +15k. Factoring out a k, it becomes k*(128k⁵ + 480k⁴ + 680k³ + 450k² +137k +15). The user also found that the numerator's minimal polynomial is 568k² +329k -120, and noticed that dividing numerator and denominator by 6 simplifies it. However, the user divided only the numerator by 6, not the denominator, which might be a mistake. Wait, no, in the example, the user divided the entire fraction by 6, resulting in 1/6 times the original numerator over the original denominator. But in their step, they show that the numerator factors as 6*(568k² +329k -120), so they divided numerator by 6, hence the 1/6 factor. So the denominator remains the same.\n\nBut in terms of assumptions for the problem, the original problem doesn't specify any conditions on k other than it's a positive integer starting from 1. The user is trying to manipulate the expression but hasn't added any new conditions. Therefore, the assumptions are just that k starts at 1 and goes to infinity. The problem is to prove the sum equals π. The user's steps are part of their attempt, but the core problem remains as stated. So the formatted problem should list assumptions related to the sum and the terms involved. However, in the example given by the user, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the only assumption is that the summation is from k=1 to infinity. Since the problem as stated doesn't have any other explicit conditions, the assumption would just be that k is a positive integer (since the sum starts at k=1 and goes to infinity). Wait, but in the example, they listed each assumption line by line. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: k is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum from k=1 to infinity of [3408k² +1974k -720]/[128k⁶ +480k⁵ +680k⁴ +450k³ +137k² +15k] equals π.\n\nBut the user's attempt mentions dividing by 6 and getting another expression. However, in the problem statement as per the format, we need to filter out the user's attempts and just present the original problem's assumptions and the problem itself. The original problem didn't have any assumptions except the sum from k=1 to infinity, so the assumption is that k is a positive integer. Wait, but in the example, they listed specific assumptions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe there are more assumptions? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is: \"Prove that the sum equals π\". The user tried some steps but the core problem is as stated. The denominator factors into k times a quintic polynomial. However, the problem as posed doesn't have any explicit conditions on k other than being summed from 1 to infinity. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The summation is over all positive integers k starting from 1 to infinity.\n2. The terms of the series are given by the specified rational function.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable in the expression (n being integer, etc.). Here, since the variable is k and the summation is over k starting at 1, the assumption is that k is a positive integer. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: k is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{3408 k^2+1974 k-720}{128 k^6+480 k^5+680 k^4+450 k^3+137 k^2+15 k} = \\pi$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that it's divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the problem's original assumptions are just the summation from k=1 to infinity, but maybe there's more. Wait, the original problem doesn't state any conditions on k beyond being in the sum. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions other than the sum over k ≥1. But the format requires listing all assumptions line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The summation index k is a positive integer.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", then another assumption \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, maybe there's an implicit assumption that the denominator doesn't vanish for any k ≥1. Let me check the denominator at k=1: 128*1 +480*1 +680*1 +450*1 +137*1 +15*1 = 128+480=608+680=1288+450=1738+137=1875+15=1890. So denominator at k=1 is 1890, which is non-zero. Similarly, for k=2, it's larger, so denominator is never zero for positive integers k. So that's an implicit assumption, but maybe needs to be stated. However, in the example given by the user, they only listed the explicit assumptions. Since the problem is presented as is, maybe the only assumption is that the sum is over positive integers k starting at 1. Hence:\n\nAssumption: k is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that the given sum equals π.\n\nSo that's how I should format it. The user's attempts to factor or simplify are part of their solution attempt, but the original problem doesn't include those as assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption that k is a positive integer and the problem to prove the sum equals π.",
