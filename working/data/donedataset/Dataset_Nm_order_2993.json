    "Content": "I'm an undergraduate learning about group representations and Young tableaux, and have came across Maschke's theorem stating; If $G$ is a finite group and $F$ is a field whose characteristic does not divide the order of $G$, then every finite dimensional $G$-module over $F$ is completely reducible The many proofs I have seen, show this by proving an equivalent statement that if $G$ and $F$ are as above, and $H$ is a submodule of a $G$-module $V$, then there exists a submodule $H'$ of $V$ such that $V$ is the direct product of $H$ and $H'$. This is done by showing $H'$ is the kernal of some homomorphism of $G$-modules that maps $H$ to $H$. However, the this approach doesn't seem well-motivated in the sense of; where did this homomorphism come from? Does anyone have a suitable alternative proof for an undergraduate? Or can possibly shed some intuition on the theorem? Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Actually, I think that approach can be made pretty well-motivated. Here is how I like to see it: we have a $FG$-module $V$ and a submodule $H$, and we would like to know that there is a $G$-stable complement $H'$ (under certain circumstances, e.g., always if the characteristic of $F$ is prime to $|G|$). If such a complement exists, then $V=H \\oplus H'$ and the projection onto $H$ with kernel $H'$ is a $G$-module map $V \\rightarrow H$ left inverse to the $G$-module map including $H \\hookrightarrow V$. Conversely, given a $G$-module map left inverse to this inclusion, its kernel will be a complement. Now we are left with the problem of how to find such a homomorphism. Here is the idea: consider the vector space $\\mathrm{Hom}_F(V,H)$. Inside this vector space live many projections $\\pi$ onto $H$. We'd like to find one that is a $G$-module map, that is, such that $g \\pi g^{-1}=\\pi$ for all $g \\in G$. If you stare at that equation for a second, it becomes clear that what you are really looking for is a $G$-fixed point in $\\mathrm{Hom}_F(V,H)$, where $G$ acts by conjugation. Now the time-honored way of finding a fixed point for a group action is by averaging---start with any projection whatsoever and average it over all its images by elements of $G$. The condition on the characteristic is precisely what allows you to do this! A nice thing about this point of view is that it tells you something even when the characteristic is not prime to the order of the group: it says you should really care about the functor of $G$-fixed points. This is a good way to motivate group cohomology to first year grad students, in my experience.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the problem the user presented. They want me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. The original question is about Maschke's theorem and the intuition behind it. The user is asking for an alternative proof or some intuition that an undergraduate can understand, especially since the standard proofs use a homomorphism approach that seems unmotivated to them.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions in the problem. The theorem itself states conditions: G is a finite group, F is a field, and the characteristic of F doesn't divide the order of G. Then, the conclusion is that every finite-dimensional G-module over F is completely reducible. The user also mentions the equivalent statement about submodules H having a complement H' such that V is the direct product (sum) of H and H'. The standard proof constructs H' as the kernel of a certain homomorphism.\n\nThe task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem is not to prove the theorem but to provide intuition or an alternative proof. However, in the example given, the problem was structured as \"Prove that...\", but here the question is more about explaining intuition or providing an alternative approach. But according to the user's format, the \"Problem\" section should state the actual problem. So in this case, the problem is the user's request for intuition or an alternative proof suitable for an undergraduate.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the formatted problem took the original problem's main mathematical statement and listed assumptions. Here, the original theorem is Maschke's theorem, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which the theorem holds. The problem, as per the user's question, is understanding the intuition behind the theorem or finding an alternative proof.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions: \n\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. F is a field.\n3. The characteristic of F does not divide the order of G.\n4. V is a finite-dimensional G-module over F.\n5. H is a submodule of V.\n\nBut wait, the problem as phrased by the user is asking about the intuition or alternative proof, not to reprove the theorem. However, the example given structured the problem as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps in this case, the problem statement would be the theorem itself, and the assumptions are the conditions required for the theorem. The user's actual question is about the intuition, but according to the format, we need to present the problem as it is stated, filtering out the request for intuition. Wait, the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", so the problem part should be the original problem's main question. But the original question is asking for intuition or alternative proof. However, the example given in the prompt took the original problem's mathematical statement and structured it. So perhaps here, the problem is the theorem statement, and the user's actual question (request for intuition) is part of the original problem but not the structured part. Wait, the example took the original problem's mathematical statement and formatted it, listing assumptions. The user's actual question here is about explaining intuition behind the theorem. But according to the format, the problem part should be the mathematical problem. However, in the example, the original problem was a proof question, so the formatted problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions. But here, the original problem is a request for intuition or alternative proof. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example given took the original problem's mathematical statement (Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91) and listed the assumptions. The additional context in the question (like the user's confusion about the homomorphism) was filtered out. So in this case, the original question is about Maschke's theorem, and the user is asking for intuition or an alternative proof. But according to the example, the formatted problem should present the mathematical problem to be solved. However, in the example, the user had a specific mathematical statement to prove. Here, the problem is more about understanding the theorem rather than proving it. But perhaps the problem statement is the theorem itself, and the assumptions are the conditions of the theorem.\n\nSo, applying the example's logic, the assumptions would be the conditions of Maschke's theorem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a finite group.\n- F is a field.\n- The characteristic of F does not divide the order of G.\n- V is a finite-dimensional G-module over F.\n\nProblem: Prove that V is completely reducible.\n\nBut the original problem is not asking to prove the theorem, but to provide intuition or an alternative proof. However, the example formatted the problem as \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the format expects the problem to be a mathematical statement to prove, even if the original question is about intuition. Wait, no. The user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which in the example took the mathematical statement from the original problem. So perhaps the problem here is the theorem statement itself, and the assumptions are the conditions of the theorem. Then, the user's actual question (about intuition or alternative proof) is part of the original problem but not part of the formatted problem. The formatted problem is just the mathematical problem stripped of the context. But in the example, the original problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem's statement. Wait, wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem actually had that assumption. But the example seems to have a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is not from a real problem. The user says \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" So perhaps the example is correct as per their structuring. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo or was misstated. But regardless, I need to follow their format.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question is about Maschke's theorem, asking for intuition or an alternative proof. The theorem's standard proof uses complementing submodules via a homomorphism, but the user finds this unmotivated. The problem is not to reprove the theorem but to explain the intuition. However, the formatting example took the mathematical statement to prove and listed assumptions. So perhaps for this case, the problem is the theorem statement, and the assumptions are the conditions of the theorem. Then the problem part is \"Prove that every finite-dimensional G-module over F is completely reducible.\" But the original question isn't asking to prove it but to understand the intuition. However, according to the user's example, even if the original problem is a proof request, the formatted problem lists assumptions and the problem. So perhaps here, despite the original question being about intuition, the formatted problem should present the theorem as the problem to prove, with its assumptions. Then, the user's actual request (for intuition) is considered as part of the original context but not part of the formatted problem. The user's instruction says to \"filter the unrelated informations\", so the question about intuition is considered unrelated for the formatting purpose. Thus, the formatted problem would be the theorem statement itself, with its assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n- F is a field.\n- The characteristic of F does not divide the order of G.\n- V is a finite-dimensional G-module over F.\n\nProblem: Prove that V is completely reducible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is the equivalence between the two statements (the theorem and the complement existence). But the user mentions that the theorem is equivalent to the statement about submodules having complements. So maybe the problem is to prove that equivalence. But the original problem's main theorem is Maschke's theorem, and the user is asking about the intuition behind it.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem should take the main mathematical statement. The user's question is about the intuition, but the formatted problem is the theorem itself. Therefore, following the example's approach, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a finite group,\n- F is a field,\n- The characteristic of F does not divide the order of G,\n- V is a finite-dimensional G-module over F.\n\nProblem: Prove that V is completely reducible.\n\nBut the user's actual question is about intuition, not the proof. However, the example's formatted problem took the original problem's main statement (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) even though the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Unless there was a mistake in the example. But since it's the user's example, we have to follow it as given.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the correct approach is to list all the conditions of the theorem as assumptions and state the problem as the conclusion of the theorem. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a finite group,\n- F is a field,\n- The characteristic of F does not divide the order of G,\n- V is a finite-dimensional G-module over F.\n\nProblem: Prove that V is completely reducible.\n\nBut the original problem's question is more about understanding the intuition behind the theorem or finding an alternative proof. However, according to the user's format, the problem part is the mathematical problem to solve. The example's problem part was the mathematical statement to prove, so perhaps here the problem is the theorem to prove, and the user's actual question (intuition) is considered part of the original context but filtered out. Therefore, the formatted problem would focus on the theorem's statement, with its assumptions, as the problem to prove.\n\nThus, the final answer would structure it as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nG is a finite group,\nF is a field,\nThe characteristic of F does not divide the order of G,\nV is a finite-dimensional G-module over F.\nProblem: Prove that V is completely reducible.\n###",
