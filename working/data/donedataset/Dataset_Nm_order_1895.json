    "Content": "$F$ is an extension field of a field $K$. Let $F$  be an algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{Z}_p $ ($p$ prime). Show that $(i)$ $F$ is algebraic Galois over $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ $(ii)$  The map $\\alpha:F\\rightarrow F$ given by $u\\mapsto u^p$ is a nonidentiy $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-automorphism of $F$. $(iii)$  The subgroup $H=\\langle \\alpha \\rangle$ is a proper subgroup of Aut$(F/\\mathbb{Z}_p)$ where the fixed field is $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, which is also the fixed field of Aut$(F/\\mathbb{Z}_p)$ by $(i).$ So, here is my attempt for (i). Let  $S \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_p[x])$ of monic polynomials of the form $x^{p^n}-x$.  Then for all $f\\in S$, gcd$(f,f^{\\prime})=1$(i.e, the polynomials are separble) and $F=\\mathbb{Z}_p(a\\in F:f(a)=0)$. So $(F/\\mathbb{Z}_p)$ is Galois. I'd be glad if I could get assistance for (ii) and (iii) as well.  Thanks. ADDED: Attempt at (iii). but I know that since $F/\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a finite Galois extension, its fixed field is $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ hints... The field $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ must be contained in $F$. For $a\\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$, $\\alpha(a)=a^p=a$. Thus the polynomial $x^p-x$ has $p$ zeros in $F$, namely, the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. But the elements fixed under $\\alpha$ are precisely the zeros in $F$ of $x^p-x$. Hence the fixed field of $\\alpha$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ which is also the fixed field of Aut$(F/\\mathbb{Z}_p)$. Left to show that $H$ is a proper subgroup... If it helps I know that the order of $\\langle \\alpha \\rangle $ is $n$...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will use $\\mathbf{F}_p$ to denote the field of $p$ elements (what you denote as $\\mathbb{Z}_p$), $\\mathbf{F}_{p^k}$ to denote the field of $p^k$ elements, and $\\mathbf{F}$ for the algebraic closure of $\\mathbf{F}_p$ (what the OP calls $F$). Your work in (i) is very rough (and at point unintelligible). For instance, you write \"$\\gcd(f,f')$ (i.e., the polynomials are separable)\". That is, prima facie , nonsensical. (Did you forget to say what the greatest common divisor was equal to?). Also, you are only dealing with certain kinds of polynomials. Finally, you did not say what you were going to do with $S$, it was just left hanging there. Presumably, you were trying to say: \"take $S$ to be the set of all polynomials of the form $x^{p^n}-x$, with $n$ a positive integer. These polynomials are separable, and $F$ is the splitting field of $S$. Thus, $F$ is Galois over $\\mathbf{F}_p$, since it is the splitting field of a set of separable polynomials.\" That is okay as far as it goes, but how do you know that $\\mathbf{F}$ is the splitting field of $S$? It is clear that the splitting field of $S$ is contained in $\\mathbf{F}$, but you have provided not argument (or ghost of one) for showing that every element of $\\mathbf{F}$ must be in the splitting field of $S$. For that, you need to argue that given any $a\\in\\mathbf{F}$, you know that $[\\mathbf{F}_p(a):\\mathbf{F}]$ is finite (why?), hence $\\mathbf{F}_p(a) = \\mathbf{F}_{p^k}$ for some $k$ (why?), and so $a$ is a root of $x^{p^k}-x$ (why?), hence $a$ is in the splitting field of $S$. This will establish (i) correctly. For (ii), proving that $u\\mapsto u^p$ is indeed an automorphism is straightforward. To prove that it is not the identity... Think about $\\mathbf{F}_{p^2}$. What do you know about its multiplicative subgroup? Can exponentiation by $p$ be the identity map on all those elements? Are they in $\\mathbf{F}$? For (iii): the point here is to show that in the infinite extension case, the correspondence between subgroups of the Galois group and subfields of the extension no longer holds. You are being asked to prove that there is more than one subgroup whose fixed field is precisely the ground field (if you think about the finite Galois case, that never happens). Explicitly, you are being asked to show two things: that the fixed field of the subgroup generated by $\\alpha$ is precisely the ground field; and that the subgroup generated by $\\alpha$ is not all of the Galois group. This will show that there are at least two distinct subgroups (both $H$ and all of $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbf{F}/\\mathbf{F}_p)$) that have the same fixed field, which shows the correspondence you know from the finite extension case no longer holds here. The first part should be easy if you have managed to understand part (ii).\nFirst, pick $a\\in \\mathbf{F}$, $a\\notin \\mathbf{F}_p$. Try thinking about $\\mathbf{F}(a)$, and combining the ideas of (i) and (ii), use them to show that $\\alpha(a)\\neq a$, so that the fixed field of $\\alpha$ is contained in $\\mathbf{F}_p$. The trickier part is to show that the powers of $\\alpha$ are not the only automorphisms of the algebraic closure. Added. Exhibing an explicit element of the Galois group that is not a power of $\\alpha$ is fairly straightforward if you know what is going on behind the scenes, but it would likely be challenging when doing this problem, since it would seem to me that the point of the problem is to show you that there is something going on behind the scenes. You can show that the automorphism group is not cyclic by exhibiting two elements of infinite order such that the subgroups they generate intersection trivially. One possibility: for distinct primes $q$ and $\\ell$, consider the two towers\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\mathbf{F}_p \\subseteq \\mathbf{F}_{p^q}\\subseteq \\mathbf{F}_{p^{q^2}}\\subseteq\\cdots\\\\\n&\\mathbf{F}_p \\subseteq \\mathbf{F}_{p^{\\ell}} \\subseteq \\mathbf{F}_{p^{\\ell^2}}\\subseteq\\cdots\n\\end{align*}\nThe two towers are dijsoint: since $\\mathbf{F}_{p^n}\\subseteq \\mathbf{F}_{p^m}$ if and only if $n|m$, any field from one tower intersects any field in the other tower at just $\\mathbf{F}_p$. Use the usual properties of extension of isomorphisms to show that there is an element in $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbf{F}/\\mathbf{F}_p)$ that acts like $\\alpha$ on the first tower, but like the identity on the second tower. Then show that there is an element in $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbf{F}/\\mathbf{F}_p)$ that acts like $\\alpha$ on the second tower and like the identity on the first tower. Call these $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$. Now note that $\\langle\\beta_1\\rangle\\cap\\langle\\beta_2\\rangle = \\{1\\}$. But if $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbf{F}/\\mathbf{F}_p) = \\langle\\alpha\\rangle$, then any two nontrivial subgroups have a nontrivial intersection. Added. I'm really at a loss on trying to give you enough without entirely spoiling the problem; based on the confusion that this (nontrivial) problem has engendered, I'm guessing that you are still very much a beginner with Galois groups in general and finite fields in particular... Another thing you can do: since $\\alpha$ has infinite order, it would be enough to exhibit an element of $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbf{F}/\\mathbf{F}_p)$ that has finite order. Again, you can try to do this by using extension properties of automorphisms.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user has three parts to address: (i), (ii), and (iii). But they mentioned they already attempted (i) and need help with (ii) and (iii). However, the task here is to structure the problem according to the given format. Let me start by parsing the original question carefully.\n\nFirst, the problem is about showing three things regarding the algebraic closure F of the finite field Z_p (where p is prime). The three parts are:\n\n(i) F is algebraic Galois over Z_p.\n\n(ii) The map α: F → F defined by u ↦ u^p is a non-identity Z_p-automorphism of F.\n\n(iii) The subgroup H = ⟨α⟩ is a proper subgroup of Aut(F/Z_p), where the fixed field of H is Z_p, which is also the fixed field of Aut(F/Z_p) by part (i).\n\nThe user's attempt for (i) involves considering the set S of monic polynomials x^{p^n} - x in Z_p[x]. They note that these polynomials are separable because gcd(f, f') = 1, and since F is the splitting field of all these polynomials, F/Z_p is Galois. That seems okay, but the main focus here is to structure the problem, not evaluate the attempt.\n\nFor part (ii), the user needs to show that α is a non-identity automorphism. The key points here would be to verify that α is a field automorphism, that it fixes Z_p (since it's a Z_p-automorphism), and that it's not the identity map. For finite fields, the Frobenius endomorphism (u ↦ u^p) is well-known, but since F is the algebraic closure, which is infinite, we need to ensure that α is indeed an automorphism and not just an endomorphism. Also, since F is algebraically closed, applying Frobenius should be surjective, hence an automorphism. But since p is the characteristic, and the Frobenius map is injective (as fields have no nilpotents), it's bijective. But we have to check that it's not the identity. For example, take an element not in Z_p, say a primitive element of F over Z_p. Applying α to it would give a^p, which might not equal a unless a is in Z_p. So α is not the identity.\n\nFor part (iii), the user needs to show that H, generated by α, is a proper subgroup of Aut(F/Z_p). Since F is the algebraic closure, its automorphism group is the profinite completion of the integers, generated by the Frobenius automorphism. But in the case of algebraic closures, the automorphism group is much larger. However, H here is the cyclic subgroup generated by α. To show it's proper, one might note that Aut(F/Z_p) is not cyclic. Alternatively, consider that there are automorphisms that act differently on different finite extensions within F. For example, for each n, there's an automorphism sending u to u^{p^n}, and these generate different automorphisms not in H. Hence H is proper.\n\nBut the user's added attempt mentions that they know the fixed field of Aut(F/Z_p) is Z_p by part (i). They also note that the fixed field of H is Z_p, so need to show H is a proper subgroup. They mention that the order of ⟨α⟩ is n, which might be a confusion because in finite extensions, the Frobenius automorphism has finite order, but in the algebraic closure, which is infinite, the Frobenius automorphism has infinite order. Wait, but maybe the user is conflating the finite field case with the algebraic closure. In the algebraic closure, the automorphism group is not finite; it's a profinite group. So H would be an infinite cyclic subgroup, but Aut(F/Z_p) is not cyclic. Therefore, H is proper.\n\nNow, the task is to structure the problem according to the specified format. The example given lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\nF is an extension field of K (here K is Z_p). F is an algebraic closure of Z_p (p prime). Then:\n\n(i) F is algebraic Galois over Z_p.\n\n(ii) α: F→F, u↦u^p is a non-identity Z_p-automorphism.\n\n(iii) H = ⟨α⟩ is a proper subgroup of Aut(F/Z_p), where the fixed field of H is Z_p (which is also the fixed field of Aut(F/Z_p) by (i)).\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a field extension of Z_p.\n\n- F is an algebraic closure of Z_p.\n\n- p is a prime number.\n\n- α is defined as the map u ↦ u^p.\n\n- H is the subgroup generated by α.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions list conditions on the objects. For instance, in the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a condition on one object.\n\nSo translating that here:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- F is an extension field of Z_p.\n\n- F is an algebraic closure of Z_p.\n\n- p is a prime number.\n\n- α: F → F is defined by α(u) = u^p.\n\n- H is the subgroup of Aut(F/Z_p) generated by α.\n\n- The fixed field of Aut(F/Z_p) is Z_p. (from part (i))\n\nBut wait, part (i) is something that needs to be proven, so perhaps we shouldn't include it as an assumption. The problem states \"by (i)\" when discussing the fixed field. So perhaps the fixed field being Z_p for Aut(F/Z_p) is part of the problem's given after (i). However, the original problem lists all three parts, so when structuring the problem, perhaps the assumptions are only the given conditions, not the parts to prove.\n\nLooking back at the original problem statement:\n\nOriginal problem parts:\n\n(i) Show F is algebraic Galois over Z_p.\n\n(ii) Show α is a non-identity Z_p-automorphism.\n\n(iii) Show H is a proper subgroup of Aut(F/Z_p) where the fixed field of H is Z_p (which is also the fixed field of Aut(F/Z_p) by (i)).\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- F is an extension field of K (here K is Z_p).\n\n- F is an algebraic closure of Z_p.\n\n- p is prime.\n\nTherefore, when structuring, the assumptions should be the given conditions before the problem parts. The problem parts are (i), (ii), (iii). But the user has already attempted (i) and added some thoughts on (iii), but the task is to structure the problem as per the example.\n\nThe example extracted assumptions from the problem statement. In the original example, the user had an assumption that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. But in the problem statement, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. However, this seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so there's no divisibility by 7 required. So perhaps the example has a mistake. But regardless, the instruction is to follow the format, not the example's correctness.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the user is to list the assumptions from the problem statement. The problem says:\n\n\"F is an extension field of a field K. Let F be an algebraic closure of Z_p (p prime). Show that (i)... (ii)... (iii)...\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- F is an extension field of K (but in the problem, K is Z_p, since F is algebraic closure of Z_p). However, the problem statement starts with \"F is an extension field of a field K\", but then specifies that F is the algebraic closure of Z_p. So perhaps K is Z_p here. But to clarify, maybe the problem's initial statement is that F is an extension field of K, and F is an algebraic closure of Z_p, where K is Z_p. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- F is an extension field of Z_p.\n\n- F is an algebraic closure of Z_p.\n\n- p is a prime number.\n\nThus, each of these would be separate assumptions. The problem parts (i), (ii), (iii) are to be stated.\n\nBut the user's problem has three parts. However, the example given in the instruction only had a single problem. The user here has three parts. But according to the format, we need to list all the problem parts as the \"Problem\" section.\n\nWait, the example's original problem had to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed assumptions and then the problem. So here, the problem has three parts. But the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". So how to handle multiple parts? The example's problem had a single statement. But in this case, the problem has three parts. So perhaps we list all three parts under \"Problem\".\n\nBut the original user's problem has three parts, so the formatted problem should include all three parts.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- F is an extension field of Z_p.\n\n- F is an algebraic closure of Z_p.\n\n- p is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\n\n(i) Show that F is algebraic Galois over Z_p.\n\n(ii) Show that the map α: F → F given by u ↦ u^p is a non-identity Z_p-automorphism of F.\n\n(iii) Show that the subgroup H = ⟨α⟩ is a proper subgroup of Aut(F/Z_p), where the fixed field of H is Z_p, which is also the fixed field of Aut(F/Z_p) by part (i).\n\nBut the example in the instruction had the problem as \"Prove that ...\". Here, the problem is a list of three things to show, but the format requires the problem to be stated. However, the example didn't have multiple parts. The user might need to list all three parts in the problem section. Alternatively, if the original problem is presented as three parts, then the formatted problem should include all three.\n\nBut the original problem's formatting example combined multiple parts into one? No, the example was a single problem. But here, the problem has three parts. So perhaps the formatted problem should include all three parts as a single problem statement with three items.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is written as one statement. So maybe here, the problem would be written as three separate statements. However, the user's original problem includes three parts, so the formatted problem should encapsulate all three. Therefore, the Problem section should list all three parts (i), (ii), (iii) as the problem.\n\nAdditionally, the assumptions need to be extracted from the problem statement. The problem says F is an extension field of K (but here K is Z_p), F is the algebraic closure of Z_p, p is prime. The map α is defined as part of the problem (ii), so perhaps α is part of the problem, not an assumption. Similarly, H is defined in part (iii), so it's part of the problem, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- F is an extension field of Z_p.\n\n- F is an algebraic closure of Z_p.\n\n- p is a prime number.\n\nThese are the given conditions. The map α and subgroup H are introduced in the problem parts, so they are part of the problem statements, not assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\nF is an extension field of Z_p,\n\nF is an algebraic closure of Z_p,\n\np is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\n\n(i) Show that F is algebraic Galois over Z_p.\n\n(ii) Show that the map α: F → F defined by u ↦ u^p is a non-identity Z_p-automorphism of F.\n\n(iii) Show that the subgroup H = ⟨α⟩ is a proper subgroup of Aut(F/Z_p) where the fixed field of H is Z_p, which is also the fixed field of Aut(F/Z_p) by (i).\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is written as a single statement. However, in the original problem here, there are three distinct parts. The user's example had the problem as \"Prove that...\", but the current problem has three sub-problems. So perhaps in the Problem section, we need to list all three parts as a single problem with three items.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's example had multiple parts, how was it handled? The example had a single problem statement. So perhaps the way to handle this is to write the problem as three separate points under the Problem section.\n\nBut the format says \"Problem: <The problem>\". So perhaps the Problem field should include all three parts as bullet points or enumerated list, but within the same line. However, in the example, the problem was a single line. Therefore, to adhere to the format, maybe write the problem as a single sentence mentioning all three parts.\n\nAlternatively, follow the exact original problem's wording. The original problem says \"Show that (i)... (ii)... (iii)...\". So the problem is to show these three things, so the Problem section can be written as:\n\nProblem: Show that\n\n(i) F is algebraic Galois over Z_p,\n\n(ii) the map α: F → F given by u ↦ u^p is a non-identity Z_p-automorphism of F,\n\n(iii) the subgroup H = ⟨α⟩ is a proper subgroup of Aut(F/Z_p) where the fixed field of H is Z_p, which is also the fixed field of Aut(F/Z_p) by (i).\n\nThis way, it's a single problem statement with three parts.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have assumptions and the problem as above.\n\nNow, checking for each assumption to be one line, each applying to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- F is an extension field of Z_p.\n\n- F is an algebraic closure of Z_p.\n\n- p is a prime number.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition on a single object.\n\nProblem is the three parts as listed.\n\nThat should be the correct formatting.",
