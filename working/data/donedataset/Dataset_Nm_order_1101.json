    "Content": "I'm working through Vakil's algebraic geometry text and I've been stuck on Exercise 1.6.E (page 52 on http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGjun1113public.pdf .) Suppose that $F$ is an exact functor. Show that applying $F$ to an exact sequence preserves exactness. For example, if $F$ is covariant and $A' \\to A \\to A''$ is exact, then $FA' \\to FA \\to FA''$ is exact. Here's what I've been thinking: Let the maps be denoted $f, g$ (so we have $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$). We know $F$ is left-exact and right-exact. To use the left-exactness of $F$, we note that $0 \\to \\ker f \\to A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact, so $0 \\to F(\\ker f) \\to FA \\xrightarrow{Fg} FA''$ is exact. However, I'm not quite sure what to do with the $F(\\ker f)$ object. (It'd be nice if $F(\\ker f) = \\ker Ff$ but I don't see any reason for this to actually be true.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We have a diagram with exact diagonals. Applying $F$ gives a diagram also with exact diagonals. Now, note that\n\\begin{align*}\n\\DeclareMathOperator{Im}{Im}\\Im F(f)\n&= \\Im\\big(F(A^\\prime)\\to F(\\Im f)\\to F(A)\\big) \\\\\n&\\overset{\\ast}{=} \\Im\\big(F(\\Im f)\\to F(A)\\big) \\\\\n&= \\DeclareMathOperator{Ker}{Ker}\\Ker\\big(F(A)\\to F(\\Im g)\\big) \\\\\n&\\overset{\\circledast}{=} \\Ker\\big(F(A)\\to F(\\Im g)\\to F(A^{\\prime\\prime})\\big) \\\\\n&= \\Ker F(g)\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\ast$ holds since $F(A^\\prime)\\to F(\\Im f)$ is epi and $\\circledast$ holds since $F(\\Im g) \\to F(A^{\\prime\\prime})$ is mono.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure a given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem thoroughly.\n\nThe original problem is about exact functors in abelian categories. The user mentions Exercise 1.6.E from Vakil's algebraic geometry text. The task is to show that applying an exact functor F to an exact sequence preserves exactness. The example given is a covariant F applied to a sequence A' → A → A'' resulting in FA' → FA → FA'' being exact.\n\nThe user's thought process involves considering the left-exactness of F. They note that taking the kernel of the first map f, they have an exact sequence 0 → ker f → A → A'', and applying F gives 0 → F(ker f) → FA → FA''. However, they're unsure how F(ker f) relates to ker Ff.\n\nFirst, I need to structure this problem according to the given format. The format requires listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement itself.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions would relate to the properties of the functor F and the categories involved.\n\nThe problem states that F is an exact functor. In the context of abelian categories, an exact functor is one that preserves exact sequences, meaning it's both left-exact and right-exact. The category is abelian, so it has all kernels, cokernels, and the necessary structure for homological algebra. The functor F is additive, which is typical in abelian categories, as additive functors preserve biproducts.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. F is an exact functor (covariant in the example).\n2. The categories involved are abelian.\n3. F is additive (since we're dealing with exact functors between abelian categories, additivity is often implicit, but it's worth stating).\n4. The original sequence A' → A → A'' is exact.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that applying F preserves exactness. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. The problem says \"Suppose that F is an exact functor. Show that applying F to an exact sequence preserves exactness.\" So the main assumptions are:\n\n- F is an exact functor (covariant, as in the example).\n- The original sequence A' → A → A'' is exact.\n\nAdditionally, since we're in abelian categories, kernels and cokernels exist, but that's part of the category structure and might not need to be listed as separate assumptions. The exactness of F implies it's additive, but maybe the user expects additivity to be an assumption. Wait, in the context of abelian categories, functors between them are often assumed to be additive, especially when talking about exactness. But to be safe, perhaps include that F is additive.\n\nHowever, in the original problem statement, does it specify that F is additive? The user mentions \"abelian categories, additive functors, and kernels\" in the title. The problem says \"Suppose that F is an exact functor.\" In many contexts, exact functors between abelian categories are assumed to be additive, but perhaps the problem assumes that. However, the title includes \"additive functors,\" which might imply that F is additive. Therefore, the assumptions should include that F is additive.\n\nSo, compiling the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- F is a covariant exact functor.\n- F is additive.\n- The categories involved are abelian.\n- The sequence A' → A → A'' is exact.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"for example, if F is covariant...\" So maybe the problem allows for contravariant as well, but the example given is covariant. However, the main problem statement just says \"Suppose that F is an exact functor.\" So the exactness of the sequence after applying F should hold whether F is covariant or contravariant, but the example is covariant. However, the problem's exact statement is to show that applying F preserves exact sequences. The user is stuck on the covariant case. So maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- F is an exact functor (could be covariant or contravariant, but the example uses covariant).\n- The original sequence is exact.\n- The categories are abelian (so kernels, cokernels exist, and the functor behaves nicely).\n\nBut in the problem as presented in the question, the user is focusing on the covariant case. The problem says \"Show that applying F to an exact sequence preserves exactness. For example, if F is covariant and A' → A → A'' is exact, then FA' → FA → FA'' is exact.\"\n\nSo the main assumptions for this example case are:\n\n1. F is a covariant exact functor.\n2. The sequence A' → A → A'' is exact.\n3. The categories involved are abelian (since kernels, exact sequences are part of abelian categories).\n4. F is additive. (Because exact functors between abelian categories are additive; but maybe this is implied by being exact.)\n\nWait, actually, exact functors between abelian categories are additive by definition. Because an exact functor preserves finite limits and colimits, which includes biproducts, hence additive. So perhaps the additivity is a consequence of being exact in this context. Therefore, maybe we don't need to list F as additive separately. However, in some definitions, exact functors are required to be additive. It depends on the source. Vakil's notes might assume additive.\n\nLooking at the user's original question, the title includes \"additive functors,\" so maybe the problem is in the context of additive functors. Therefore, perhaps F is assumed to be additive. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a covariant exact functor.\n- F is additive.\n- The categories are abelian.\n- The sequence A' → A → A'' is exact.\n\nBut perhaps \"exact functor\" already implies additive in this context. To confirm, in homological algebra, an exact functor between abelian categories is additive. So maybe additivity is redundant. However, to be safe, since the user's title includes additive functors, it's better to include it.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the example. The example had:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn our case, the assumptions would be the properties of F and the sequence. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- F is a covariant exact functor.\n- F is additive.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n- The categories involved are abelian.\n\nBut the problem is to show that applying F preserves exactness, i.e., FA' → FA → FA'' is exact. However, the original problem says \"Suppose that F is an exact functor. Show that applying F to an exact sequence preserves exactness.\" So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. F is an exact functor.\n2. The input sequence is exact.\n\nThe rest (categories being abelian, F being additive) might be part of the context but are not explicitly stated in the problem. However, since the problem is in the context of abelian categories and additive functors (as per the title), we should include them.\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were specific to the problem: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So in our case, the assumptions should be specific to the problem. The problem states that F is an exact functor, and the sequence is exact. The categories being abelian and F being additive are part of the general context but not specific assumptions. Wait, but the user's example includes \"n is divisible by 7\" which is a specific condition. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- F is an exact functor.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n\nBut the problem is to show that applying F to an exact sequence preserves exactness. The original problem says \"applying F to an exact sequence preserves exactness,\" so the key assumptions are F is exact and the input sequence is exact. However, in the context of abelian categories, maybe the category being abelian is an assumption. The example didn't mention the category's properties, but in this case, since the problem is about abelian categories, that's a necessary assumption.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The categories involved are abelian.\n- F is an exact functor.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n, so here, the objects are the categories, functor, and sequence. So the answer should list each assumption line by line.\n\nWait, the user's example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. So each line is a separate assumption. Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. F is a covariant exact functor. (Since the example specifies covariant)\n2. The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n3. The categories involved are abelian.\n4. F is an additive functor.\n\nBut maybe \"exact functor\" implies additive in abelian categories. Let me check Vakil's notes. The problem is from Exercise 1.6.E. Looking at the notes, in section 1.6, he discusses additive and exact functors. He defines exact functors as those that preserve exact sequences, and mentions that exact functors are additive. So in this context, F being exact implies it's additive. Therefore, the additivity is redundant and doesn't need to be listed separately. Hence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a covariant exact functor between abelian categories.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n\nBut the problem states \"Suppose that F is an exact functor. Show that applying F to an exact sequence preserves exactness.\" So the main assumptions are:\n\n1. F is an exact functor (covariant in the example).\n2. The input sequence is exact.\n\nThe abelian category structure is part of the context, but perhaps needs to be an explicit assumption because the problem is set in abelian categories. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- F is a covariant exact functor.\n- The categories involved are abelian.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is in abelian categories, maybe that's given, and the key assumptions are F being exact and the sequence being exact. However, the example included properties of n, so in this case, to match the format, we should list each relevant condition.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $F$ is a covariant exact functor.\n- The categories involved are abelian.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\nProblem:\nShow that applying $F$ to the exact sequence preserves exactness, i.e., $FA' \\xrightarrow{Ff} FA \\xrightarrow{Fg} FA''$ is exact.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement says \"Show that applying F to an exact sequence preserves exactness. For example, if F is covariant...\" So the general problem is to show that exact functors preserve exact sequences, with the example given. However, the user's specific question is about the example with the covariant F. But according to the instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the example. The original example was a specific problem (prove A(n) divisible by 91) with specific assumptions (n integer, n divisible by 7).\n\nTherefore, for this problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- F is a covariant exact functor.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n\nPossibly also the abelian categories, but maybe that's part of the context. However, in the example, the divisibility by 7 was an assumption, so here the key assumptions are F being exact covariant and the sequence being exact. The abelian category is part of the setup but maybe not listed as an assumption. Alternatively, since the title mentions abelian categories, perhaps it's necessary.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were n is integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem listed both, even though the original problem didn't state n divisible by 7. Wait, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, no, wait the user's example seems to have modified the problem. Wait, no, in the example, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7; it was for all integers n. So the example provided by the user is incorrect. But since that's the example given, we have to follow it.\n\nTherefore, the user's formatting example takes the original problem, which had a universal quantifier (\"for every integer n\"), and in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. This suggests that maybe the user wants to extract implicit assumptions or conditions from the problem. However, in that example, it's incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. The number 91 is 7*13, so maybe the user thought to split into divisibility by 7 and 13, but that's not clear.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's example, even if it's incorrect, we need to structure the current problem similarly. So, in the current problem, the original question says \"Suppose that F is an exact functor. Show that applying F to an exact sequence preserves exactness.\" The user's example added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps here, we need to extract assumptions from the problem statement. The problem says \"F is an exact functor\" and \"applying F to an exact sequence\". So the assumptions are:\n\n- F is an exact functor.\n- The sequence is exact.\n\nBut the user's example added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) to the original problem which didn't have it. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to list all conditions mentioned in the problem, breaking them into separate lines. In this case:\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\n1. F is an exact functor.\n2. The sequence is exact.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n- $F$ is an exact functor.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n\nProblem:\nShow that applying $F$ to the exact sequence preserves exactness, i.e., $FA' \\xrightarrow{Ff} FA \\xrightarrow{Fg} FA''$ is exact.\n\nBut the original problem's example added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) to the original problem which was for all n. This seems to be a mistake, but since the user provided that example, we have to follow their structure. However, in this current problem, the original question doesn't have extra assumptions beyond what's stated: F is exact, and the sequence is exact. The user's title mentions abelian categories and additive functors, so maybe those are part of the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, considering the title includes \"abelian categories, additive functors, and kernels,\" we need to include:\n\nAssumption:\n- The categories involved are abelian.\n- $F$ is an additive functor.\n- $F$ is exact.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n\nProblem:\nShow that applying $F$ to the exact sequence preserves exactness.\n\nBut in the example, the user included assumptions that were not all explicitly stated in the original problem. The original problem here states that F is exact and the sequence is exact. The abelian category and additive functor are part of the context given in the title and the exercise's framework. So maybe those should be listed as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, final answer:\n\nAssumption:\n- The categories involved are abelian.\n- $F$ is an additive functor.\n- $F$ is an exact functor.\n- The sequence $A' \\xrightarrow{f} A \\xrightarrow{g} A''$ is exact.\n\nProblem:\nShow that applying $F$ to the exact sequence preserves exactness, i.e., the sequence $FA' \\xrightarrow{Ff} FA \\xrightarrow{Fg} FA''$ is exact.\n\nBut wait, in abelian categories, exact functors are by definition additive. So maybe \"additive\" is redundant here. However, since the title includes \"additive functors,\" it's safer to include it. Also, the problem might be emphasizing that F is additive. Hence, including all relevant assumptions.",
