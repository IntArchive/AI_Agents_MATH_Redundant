    "Content": "It's well known, that passing to modules of fractions is exact, i.e. if $$M'\\xrightarrow{f} M\\xrightarrow{g} M''$$ is an exact sequence of $A$ -modules ( $A$ being a commutative ring with unity), then for every multiplicative subset $S\\subset A$ , the induced sequence $$S^{-1}M'\\to S^{-1}M\\to S^{-1}M''$$ is exact. But none of the books on commutative algebra I know treats whether for $M'\\to M\\to M''$ to be exact it suffices that $M'_\\mathfrak{p}\\to M_\\mathfrak{p} \\to M''_\\mathfrak{p}$ is exact for each prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}\\subset A$ . So I was looking for a proof, even if I didn't expected it to be true (at least without some finiteness assumptions), and surprisingly it seems to work. But it's too easy to be right, though I can't find the error — so where am I mistaken? These are my thought: Let $M'_\\mathfrak{p}\\to M_\\mathfrak{p} \\to M''_\\mathfrak{p}$ be exact for each prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}\\subset A$ (one could take maximal ideals as well). Then (only for the case this wasn't assumed anyway) we have $\\operatorname{im}(f)\\subset \\ker(g)$ , since for each prime $\\mathfrak{p}\\subset A$ we have $0=g_\\mathfrak{p}\\circ f_\\mathfrak{p}(x) = (g\\circ f)_\\mathfrak{p}(x) = g\\circ f (x)$ in $M''_\\mathfrak{p}$ for all $x\\in M'$ , hence there exists $s\\in A\\setminus\\mathfrak{p}$ such that $s\\; (g\\circ f(x))=0$ . But with a standard argument (take $\\mathfrak{p}\\supset\\operatorname{ann}(g\\circ f(x))$ to produce a contradiction to the contrary) we get $g\\circ f(x) = 0$ and $\\operatorname{im}(f)\\subset \\ker(g)$ . Now we know, that the inclusion map $i\\colon\\operatorname{im}(f)\\hookrightarrow \\ker(g)$ is defined. But for each prime $\\mathfrak{p}\\subset A$ we assumed $i_\\mathfrak{p}\\colon \\operatorname{im}(f_\\mathfrak{p})\\to\\ker(g_\\mathfrak{p})$ to be bijective and this is a local property, so $i\\colon\\operatorname{im}(f)\\to \\ker(g)$ is too and finally $\\operatorname{im}(f)=\\ker(g)$ . Of cause this requires that localization commutes with $\\ker$ and $\\operatorname{im}$ , but I'm sure this is true. I'm getting more and more convinced it's right the more often I look at it but still, something bothers me. Any Suggestions or even counter examples?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, exactness is indeed local, and localisation commutes with $\\ker$ and $\\operatorname{im}$ (since localisation is exact). In fact, exactness is so local that you just need to check it at the maximal ideals. Here is a sketch: $M = 0$ if and only if $M_\\mathfrak{m} = 0$ for all maximal ideals $\\mathfrak{m}$. A homomorphism $M \\to N$ is a monomorphism/epimorphism/isomorphism if and only if $M_\\mathfrak{m} \\to N_\\mathfrak{m}$ is a monomorphism/epimorphism/isomorphism for all maximal ideals $\\mathfrak{m}$. [Use (1).] Suppose we have a sequence of modules and homomorphisms:\n$$0 \\longrightarrow M'' \\longrightarrow M \\longrightarrow M' \\longrightarrow 0$$\nSuppose also that this sequence is exact after localising at $\\mathfrak{m}$, for all maximal ideals $\\mathfrak{m}$. Then, by (1), the sequence is a chain complex, and by (2), the sequence is exact at $M''$ and $M'$. Since we have a chain complex, there is an induced homomorphism $\\ker (M \\to M') \\to \\operatorname{coker} (M'' \\to M)$; but this is an isomorphism after localising at each $\\mathfrak{m}$, so the homomorphism is already an isomorphism, and thus the sequence is exact at $M$ as well.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking whether exactness of a sequence of modules can be checked locally at each prime ideal. They mention that the standard result is that exactness is preserved under localization, but they're considering the converse: if all localizations at primes are exact, is the original sequence exact?\n\nThe user starts by assuming that for each prime ideal 𝔭, the localized sequence M'_𝔭 → M_𝔭 → M''_𝔭 is exact. They want to show the original sequence M' → M → M'' is exact. They outline an argument where first they show im(f) is contained in ker(g) by using the fact that if g∘f(x) localizes to zero everywhere, then g∘f(x) must be zero. Then, they consider the inclusion i: im(f) → ker(g) and note that localizing this inclusion at each prime gives an isomorphism (since the localized sequences are exact), which by a local property implies i itself is an isomorphism, hence im(f) = ker(g).\n\nThey are concerned about whether this argument is valid, especially regarding the commuting of localization with taking kernels and images. They also mention a possible need for finiteness conditions but didn't assume any. The user is seeking confirmation or a counterexample.\n\nSo, to structure this into the required format:\n\nAssumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. The problem is to determine if a sequence is exact given that all its localizations are exact.\n\nFirst, identify all explicit and implicit assumptions:\n\n1. The original sequence is M' → M → M'' of A-modules.\n2. A is a commutative ring with unity.\n3. For every prime ideal 𝔭 in A, the localized sequence M'_𝔭 → M_𝔭 → M''_𝔭 is exact.\n4. The user implicitly uses that localization commutes with kernels and images (since they argue that im(f_𝔭) = ker(g_𝔭) implies im(f)_𝔭 = ker(g)_𝔭, leading to im(f) = ker(g) by locality).\n\nWait, the problem doesn't state any finiteness conditions, so the key assumptions are points 1-3. The user is questioning if 3 implies exactness of the original sequence. The problem is to prove or disprove this.\n\nIn the example provided earlier, assumptions were listed as specific conditions on the objects (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a commutative ring with unity.\n- The sequence M' → M → M'' of A-modules is such that for every prime ideal 𝔭 of A, the localized sequence M'_𝔭 → M_𝔭 → M''_𝔭 is exact.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states that the user is trying to see if exactness at all primes implies exactness of the original sequence. So the problem is: Given that for every prime ideal 𝔭, the localized sequence is exact, does the original sequence M' → M → M'' have to be exact? So the problem is to prove or find a counterexample.\n\nBut the user presents their argument and asks for verification. So the problem as posed is: Is it true that if for every prime ideal 𝔭, the localized sequence M'_𝔭 → M_𝔭 → M''_𝔭 is exact, then the original sequence M' → M → M'' is exact?\n\nThe user also mentions that their argument uses that localization commutes with taking images and kernels. So maybe the key assumptions include that A is commutative with unity, the sequence is of A-modules, and localization at primes preserves exactness.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is a commutative ring with unity.\n- M' → M → M'' is a sequence of A-modules.\n- For every prime ideal 𝔭 of A, the localized sequence S^{-1}M' → S^{-1}M → S^{-1}M'' is exact, where S = A \\ 𝔭.\n- Localization commutes with taking kernels and images (but this might be a general property rather than an assumption, since the user is asserting it's true but wants to confirm).\n\nWait, but the problem is whether the conclusion holds under the assumption that all localizations are exact. So the key assumptions are the first three. The fourth point about commuting might be part of their reasoning but is not an assumption given in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a commutative ring with unity,\nM' → M → M'' is a sequence of A-modules,\nFor each prime ideal 𝔭 in A, the localized sequence M'_𝔭 → M_𝔭 → M''_𝔭 is exact.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that the original sequence M' → M → M'' is exact.\n\nBut the user is specifically asking about exactness, so the problem is to determine if under these assumptions, the sequence is exact. The user's own approach is given, but the core problem is the question in the title: \"Exactness of sequences of modules is a local property\".\n\nSo the problem is: Is exactness of a sequence of modules a local property? More formally, if for every prime ideal 𝔭 of A, the sequence M'_𝔭 → M_𝔭 → M''_𝔭 is exact, does it follow that the original sequence M' → M → M'' is exact?\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list the assumptions that A is commutative with unity, the sequence is of modules, and localizations at primes are exact, and then the problem is to prove or disprove exactness.\n\nThe user also mentions maximal ideals, so maybe the problem could also consider whether primes vs. maximal ideals make a difference, but the main assumption is primes.\n\nSo putting it all together.",
