    "Content": "Motivation behind the problem : We always could compute the $v_2(a^n+b^n)$ under some conditions by LTE ! What about expressions like $3^n+7$ , that are non factorizable ? What I did : $(1)$ I have checked that this is true for $n\\leq 1000$ $(2)$ I showed that $n$ will be even , Here's why : Suppose that $2^{n+3} \\mid 3^n +7 \\Rightarrow 8 \\mid  3^n +7 \\Rightarrow 3^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod8$ As $3^2\\equiv 1 \\pmod8 \\Rightarrow 2 \\mid n $ , thus $n$ is even ! Furthermore, if we let $n=2k$ : $\\Rightarrow 2^{n+3} \\mid 9^k +7 = 9^k - 1 +8$ $\\Rightarrow 2^{2k} \\mid \\displaystyle\\frac{9^k-1}{8} +1$ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}9^i \\equiv - 1 \\pmod{4^k} $ $\\Rightarrow \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}9^i \\equiv - 1 \\pmod{4} $ , since $k\\ge1$ As $9\\equiv 1 \\pmod4 \\Rightarrow \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}1^i \\equiv - 1 \\pmod{4} $ $\\Rightarrow k \\equiv -1 \\pmod4$ Finally, I get stuck here, but I still didn't found any contradiction yet.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm not sure whether there is a solution only relying on elementary techniques, so let me show a general method depending on [Yu's version of p-adic Baker][ $1$ ] (which thus might be a bit like nuking a mosquito). Let $v_2$ denote the $p$ -adic valuation of a non-zero rational number $a/b$ . That is, if $a = p2^n$ and $b = q2^m$ for odd numbers $p$ and $q$ , then $v_2(a/b) = n - m$ . Thus, $v_2(12/5) = 2$ . We want to find natural numbers $n$ such that $v_2(3^n + 7) \\ge n+3$ , which is equivalent to $v_2(3^n \\cdot \\frac{-1}{7} - 1) \\ge n+3$ when dividing by $-7$ .\nThen, applying the result from Yu on $\\Lambda = 3^n \\cdot (-7)^{-1} - 1$ gives that $$\nv_2(3^n \\cdot (-7)^{-1} - 1) \\le 19(20\\sqrt{m+1}\\cdot d)^{2(m+1)} e_{\\frak{p}}^{m-1} \\frac{p^{f_{\\frak{p}}}}{(f_{\\frak{p}} \\log(p))^2} \\log(e^5 m d) h_1 h_2 \\log(B).\n$$ In general, Yu looks at forms $\\alpha_1^{b_1} \\alpha_2^{b_2} \\cdots \\alpha_n^{b_n} - 1$ . Thus, we have $m = 2$ , $\\alpha_1 = 3$ , $b_1 = n$ , $\\alpha_2 = -7$ and $b_2 = -1$ .\nAs we look at the $2$ -adic valuation, $p = 2$ .\nAll three of $d$ , $e_{\\frak{p}}$ , $f_{\\frak{p}}$ are quite hard to explain in elementary terms, but because all our $\\alpha_i$ are just rational numbers, we can take all three equal to $1$ . We have that $h_i = \\max(h(\\alpha_i), \\log(p))$ , where $h$ (is the again technical) absolute logarithmic Weil height.\nAgain, as $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are integers, we can take $h(\\alpha_i) = \\log(|\\alpha_i|)$ .\nThus, $h_1 = \\max(h(3), \\log(p)) = \\max(\\log(3), \\log(2)) = \\log(3)$ and $h_2 = \\max(h(-7), \\log(2)) = \\log(|-7|)$ .\nLastly, $B = \\max(|b_1|, |b_2|) = \\max(|n|, |-1|) = \\max(n, 1)$ .\nFilling this all in, we get that for $n \\ge 1$ , $$\nv_2(3^n \\cdot (-7)^{-1} - 1) \\le 6.2 \\cdot 10^8  \\log(n)\n$$ (where I rounded the number up for convenience).\nThus, for a solution to your inequality, we have to have $6.2 \\cdot 10^8 \\log(n) \\ge n + 3$ , which implies that $n \\le 1.5 \\cdot 10^{10}$ . Now we have a (quite inpractical) upper bound which can be reduced using the method in Vepir's answer in $3^n$ does not divide $4^n+5$ for $n\\geq 2$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show that the equation \\(2^{n+3} \\mid 3^n + 7\\) has no solutions when \\(n\\) is a positive integer. \n\nFirst, let me parse the original question and the work they've already done. The user started by motivating the problem, mentioning LTE (Lifting The Exponent lemma), but since the expression \\(3^n + 7\\) isn't factorable, LTE might not apply directly. They checked up to \\(n \\leq 1000\\) and found no solutions. Then they showed that \\(n\\) must be even. Let me verify that step.\n\nThey noted that if \\(2^{n+3}\\) divides \\(3^n +7\\), then modulo 8, we have \\(3^n +7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 8\\). Since 7 mod 8 is -1, this simplifies to \\(3^n \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\\). Since \\(3^2 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\\), the order of 3 modulo 8 is 2, so \\(n\\) must be even. Therefore, \\(n = 2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(n = 2k\\) into the original equation gives \\(2^{2k + 3} \\mid 9^k +7\\). Then they rewrote \\(9^k +7\\) as \\(9^k -1 +8\\), which is \\((9^k -1) +8\\). Since \\(9^k -1\\) factors as \\((9 -1)(9^{k-1} + 9^{k-2} + \\dots + 1)\\), which is 8 times a sum. Therefore, \\(9^k -1 = 8 \\cdot \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 9^i\\). So substituting back, the expression becomes \\(8 \\cdot \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 9^i +8 = 8\\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}9^i +1 \\right)\\). Therefore, the divisibility condition becomes \\(2^{2k +3} \\mid 8\\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}9^i +1 \\right)\\). Dividing both sides by 8, we need \\(2^{2k} \\mid \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}9^i +1\\). \n\nSo the problem reduces to showing that \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}9^i +1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4^k\\). Then the user simplified this sum modulo \\(4^k\\). First, they checked modulo 4. Since 9 ≡ 1 mod 4, each term \\(9^i\\) is 1 mod 4, so the sum \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}1 = k\\). Therefore, the sum plus 1 is \\(k +1 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\). Hence, \\(k +1 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\) implies \\(k \\equiv -2 \\mod 4\\), which is \\(k \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\). Therefore, \\(k = 4m + 2\\) for some integer \\(m\\). \n\nBut the user mentioned getting stuck here. Let's think further. Let's substitute \\(k = 4m + 2\\) into the original equation. Then \\(n = 2k = 8m +4\\). So we need to check whether \\(2^{8m +4 +3} = 2^{8m +7}\\) divides \\(3^{8m +4} +7\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use induction or more refined modular analysis. Let's consider higher powers of 2. For example, let's check modulo 16. Since \\(n = 2k\\), and \\(k\\) is even (from k ≡ 2 mod 4), let's see if there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, actually, let's start by looking at small values. Let's take the user's approach that they checked up to n=1000, but maybe even for small n, there are contradictions. Let's test n=2. Then 3^2 +7 = 9 +7 =16. 2^{2+3}=32. 16 is not divisible by 32, so n=2 is invalid. Next, n=4: 3^4 +7=81+7=88. 2^{4+3}=128. 88 is not divisible by 128. Similarly, n=6: 3^6 +7=729 +7=736. 736 divided by 2^9=512. 736/512=1.4375, so not an integer. n=8: 3^8=6561 +7=6568. 2^{11}=2048. 6568/2048≈3.207, not integer. So even for small even n, the divisibility fails. Therefore, perhaps the user is correct, but we need to show it for all n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using LTE. Let's recall LTE for 2. LTE says that if a and b are odd integers, then v_2(a^n - b^n) = v_2(a - b) + v_2(a + b) + v_2(n) -1, provided a ≡ b mod 4. But here we have 3^n +7. Let me write 7 as 2^3 -1. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can write 3^n +7 =3^n - (-7). But -7 is not a power of 3. Alternatively, maybe factor in some way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the exponent. Let’s let’s write 3^n +7 = 3^n + 2^3 -1. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe use induction. Suppose that for some k, 2^{2k +3} divides 9^k +7. Then for the next term, but induction seems tricky here.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the fact that for n even, 3^n ≡1 mod 8, so 3^n +7 ≡0 mod 8. But we need higher divisibility. Let's compute the 2-adic valuation of 3^n +7. Let v_2(3^n +7) be the exponent. The user wants to show that v_2(3^n +7) < n +3 for all positive integers n.\n\nLet’s compute v_2(3^n +7) for even n. Let’s write n=2k. Then 3^{2k} +7 =9^k +7. Let’s compute v_2(9^k +7). \n\nFirst, when k=1: 9 +7=16, v_2=4. For k=1, n=2, so n+3=5. 4 <5, so holds.\n\nk=2: 81 +7=88, v_2=3 (since 88=8*11). n=4, n+3=7. 3 <7.\n\nk=3: 729 +7=736=16*46, v_2=4. n=6, n+3=9. 4 <9.\n\nk=4: 6561 +7=6568=8*821, v_2=3. n=8, n+3=11. 3 <11.\n\nk=5: 59049 +7=59056=16*3691, v_2=4. n=10, n+3=13. 4<13.\n\nSo in all cases, v_2(9^k +7) is 3 or 4, which is way less than 2k +3. For example, when k=1: 2k+3=5, but v_2=4. When k=2: 2k+3=7, v_2=3. So it seems that v_2 doesn't exceed 4, which is much less than 2k +3 for k >=1. Hence, for all even n=2k, v_2(3^n +7) <=4 < n+3=2k+3 when k >=1 (i.e., n>=2). But when n=2k and k=1 (n=2), 2k+3=5, and v_2=4 <5. So yes, for all n even >=2, 2^{n+3} does not divide 3^n +7. Therefore, there's no solution.\n\nBut how to formalize this? We need to show that for any even n=2k, v_2(9^k +7) <=4, which is less than 2k+3 for k>=1. Let’s try to generalize. Let’s compute 9^k +7 modulo higher powers of 2.\n\nCompute 9=1 mod 8, so 9^k=1 mod 8. Thus, 9^k +7=8 mod 8=0 mod 8. So v_2 >=3. Now compute modulo 16. 9=9 mod16, 9^1=9, 9^2=81=1 mod16. So for k odd: 9^k=9 mod16, 9^k +7=16=0 mod16. For k even:9^k=1 mod16, so 9^k +7=8 mod16. Therefore, if k is odd: v_2 >=4 (since 16 divides it), if k even: v_2=3.\n\nSo more precisely, for k odd: 9^k +7 ≡0 mod16, so v_2 >=4. Let's check modulo32. For k odd: let’s take k=1:9+7=16, which is 16 mod32, so v_2=4. For k=3:9^3=729=729-22*32=729-704=25 mod32. 25+7=32, so v_2=5. For k=5:9^5= (9^2)^2 *9= (81)^2*9. 81≡17 mod32. 17^2=289≡1 mod32. Then 1*9=9 mod32. 9+7=16 mod32, v_2=4. So alternating between 4 and5. Similarly, k=3: v_2=5, k=5: v_2=4.\n\nBut regardless, the maximum v_2 seems to be 5. Let's see for k=4: even k, so 9^4 +7=6561+7=6568. 6568 divided by16=410.5, which is 6568=16*410 +8, so modulo32:8 mod32, so v_2=3. So for even k, v_2=3. For odd k, sometimes v_2=4 or5.\n\nBut even if v_2 reaches 5, when does 2^{n+3}=2^{2k+3} divide it? For k=1:2k+3=5, v_2=4 <5. For k=3:2k+3=9, v_2=5 <9. So even the maximum v_2 is still less than required. Hence, for all k>=1, v_2(9^k +7) <=5 <2k+3. Thus, no solutions exist.\n\nTo formalize this, we can use induction or iterative approaches. Let's suppose for k >=1, v_2(9^k +7) <=5. But since 2k+3 increases linearly with k, and for k>=1, 2k+3 >=5. However, v_2(9^k +7) is at most 5, but 2k+3 will exceed 5 when k>=2. For k=2:2k+3=7, v_2=3 <7. For k=3:2k+3=9, v_2=5 <9, etc. So indeed, v_2(9^k +7) can't catch up with 2k+3 for any k>=1.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that there are no solutions.",
