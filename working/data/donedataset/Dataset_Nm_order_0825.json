    "Content": "It is well known that $$\\operatorname{R}(-e^{-\\pi})=-\\cfrac{e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{5}}}{1-\\cfrac{e^{-\\pi}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-2\\pi}}{1-\\cfrac{e^{-3\\pi}}{1+\\ddots}}}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}-\\sqrt{\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$$ where $\\operatorname{R}$ is the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction: $$\\operatorname{R}(q)=\\cfrac{q^{\\frac{1}{5}}}{1+\\cfrac{q}{1+\\cfrac{q^2}{1+\\cfrac{q^3}{1+\\ddots}}}},\\, q=e^{\\pi i\\tau}.$$ But I'm interested in $\\operatorname{R}(e^{-\\pi})$ . Numerically, I checked that it agrees with the root of the following octic equation near $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ to at least $16$ decimal places: $$x^8+14x^7+22x^6+22x^5+30x^4-22 x^3+22 x^2-14x+1=0;$$ the root turns out to be equal to $$\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\\frac{\\sqrt[4]{5}+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{5}}}{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{5}}}.$$ So is it true that $$\\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{5}}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-\\pi}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-2\\pi}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-3\\pi}}{1+\\ddots}}}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\\frac{\\sqrt[4]{5}+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{5}}}{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{5}}}?$$ The $2$ 's and $5$ 's under the square roots seem very suggestive of the nature of $\\operatorname{R}$ . Also, how could it be proved in that case? Using $$\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{R}(q)}-\\operatorname{R}(q)=\\frac{\\left(q^{\\frac{1}{5}};q^{\\frac{1}{5}}\\right)_{\\infty}}{q^{\\frac{1}{5}}(q^5;q^5)_{\\infty}}+1$$ and $$\\frac{\\eta (e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}})}{\\eta \\left(e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\right)}=n^{-\\frac{1}{4}},\\, n\\gt 0$$ (where $\\eta (q)=q^{\\frac{1}{12}}\\prod_{n\\ge 1}(1-q^{2n})$ is the Dedekind eta function),\nI've been able to evaluate $\\operatorname{R}(-e^{-\\pi})$ and $\\operatorname{R}(e^{-2\\pi})$ , but I don't know how could it be used to evaluate $\\operatorname{R}(e^{-\\pi})$ . Perhaps something else is necessary. I was inspired by Ramanujan's first letter to Hardy, where Ramanujan's $7\\text{th}$ theorem states that $$\\cfrac{1}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-2\\pi\\sqrt{n}}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-3\\pi\\sqrt{n}}}{1+\\ddots}}}}$$ can be exactly found for any $n\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$R(q)$ is expressible in terms of radicals for every $q=e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$ , where $\\tau$ is an imaginary quadratic irrational in the upper half plane. OP already observed it for $R(e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}})$ . It is easy to obtain an algebraic equation satisfied by $R(q)$ , but unwinding into radical form is more difficult. The Roger-Ramanujan continued fraction has many equivalent forms: $$R(q) = \\cfrac{q^{1/5}}{1+\\cfrac{q}{1+\\cfrac{q^2}{1+\\cfrac{q^3}{1+\\ddots}}}} = q^{1/5} \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(1-q^{5n-1})(1-q^{5n-4})}{(1-q^{5n-2})(1-q^{5n-3})}.$$ Writing $q=e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$ . From the latter expression, it can be shown that $R$ is modular of level $5$ , therefore $R$ and the $j$ -invariant has an algebraic relation of degree $[\\bar{\\Gamma}(1):\\bar{\\Gamma}(5)] = 60$ (bar means quotienting out center): $$\\tag{*}  R^5 (R^{10}+11 R^5-1)^5j+(R^{20}-228 R^{15}+494 R^{10}+228 R^5+1)^3 = 0.$$ You are concerned with $R(e^{-\\pi})$ . Since $j(i/2) = 287496$ , $R$ is a root of degree $60$ equations over $\\mathbb{Z}$ . $(*)$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$ , the octic $$R^8+14R^7+22R^6+22R^5+30R^4-22 R^3+22 R^2-14R+1$$ appears as one of the factors. Numerical evaluation will tell you that $R(e^{-\\pi})$ is indeed a root of this factor, completing the proof. The other $59$ roots of $(*)$ are values of $R$ at $\\Gamma(1)$ -orbit of $i/2$ which are $\\bar{\\Gamma}(5)$ -inequivalent.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this question and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, so I need to focus on extracting the problem and assumptions from the provided Math Stack Exchange question.\n\nFirst, the original question is about finding a closed form for a specific continued fraction involving the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, R(q). The user mentions that they know R(-e^{-π}) has a certain closed form, but they are interested in R(e^{-π}). They numerically checked it against an octic equation's root and provided an expression involving sqrt(5) terms. They ask if the equality holds and how to prove it, referencing some eta function identities and Ramanujan's theorem.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions one by one, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement should be the main question.\n\nLooking at the example, assumptions include things like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the assumptions might relate to the properties of the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, the specific value of q (q = e^{-π}), the octic equation given, and perhaps the relations involving the Dedekind eta function.\n\nWait, but the user also mentions that they used some eta function identities to evaluate R(-e^{-π}) and R(e^{-2π}) but can't apply them directly here. They also reference Ramanujan's theorem about evaluating such continued fractions for any positive rational n.\n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n\n1. The Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction R(q) is defined as R(q) = q^{1/5} / (1 + q / (1 + q^2 / (1 + q^3 / (1 + ... ))).\n2. q is set to e^{-π} for the specific case of R(e^{-π}).\n3. The octic equation x^8 +14x^7 +22x^6 +22x^5 +30x^4 -22x^3 +22x^2 -14x +1 =0 has a root near x=1/2.\n4. The specific algebraic expression involving sqrt(5) is proposed as the closed form.\n5. The Dedekind eta function identities: 1/R(q) - R(q) = [ (q^{1/5}; q^{1/5})_∞ / (q^{1/5}(q^5; q^5)_∞ ) ] + 1.\n6. Another eta function identity: η(e^{-π√n}) / η(e^{-π/√n}) = n^{-1/4} for n > 0.\n7. Ramanujan's theorem that certain continued fractions can be exactly evaluated for any positive rational n.\n\nBut the problem is to prove whether R(e^{-π}) equals that given expression. The user is asking for confirmation of the equality and a method to prove it, possibly using the mentioned identities or other methods.\n\nNow, structuring the assumptions line by line, each as a single condition or property applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction is defined as $$\\operatorname{R}(q) = \\cfrac{q^{\\frac{1}{5}}}{1+\\cfrac{q}{1+\\cfrac{q^2}{1+\\cfrac{q^3}{1+\\ddots}}}}$$ for \\( q = e^{-\\pi} \\).\n- The octic equation \\( x^8 +14x^7 +22x^6 +22x^5 +30x^4 -22x^3 +22x^2 -14x +1 =0 \\) has a root near \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n- The Dedekind eta function is defined as \\( \\eta(q) = q^{\\frac{1}{12}} \\prod_{n\\ge 1}(1 - q^{2n}) \\).\n- The identity \\( \\frac{\\eta(e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}})}{\\eta(e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{n}}})} = n^{-\\frac{1}{4}} \\) holds for \\( n > 0 \\).\n- Ramanujan's theorem states that \\( \\cfrac{1}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-2\\pi\\sqrt{n}}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-3\\pi\\sqrt{n}}}{1+\\ddots}}}} \\) can be exactly evaluated for any \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+} \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{5}}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-\\pi}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-2\\pi}}{1+\\cfrac{e^{-3\\pi}}{1+\\ddots}}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt[4]{5} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{5}}}{\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{5}}}.$$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user mentions that they have an expression for R(-e^{-pi}) but are interested in R(e^{-pi}). The continued fraction in the problem is the R(e^{-pi}), which is the left-hand side. The right-hand side is the proposed closed form. So the problem is to prove that equality.\n\nI need to check if all the assumptions are correctly listed and each addresses a single property. For example, the definition of R(q) is one assumption. The specific value of q is another. The octic equation having a root is another. The eta function definitions and identities are separate. Ramanujan's theorem is another.\n\nI think that's correct. Each bullet point is one assumption. Now, the problem is the question whether the continued fraction equals the algebraic expression.",
