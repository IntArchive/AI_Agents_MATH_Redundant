    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\bf{Modified:}$ Based on an idea from the solution of  @user111187: Consider a general integral of the form $$I_b =\\int_0^1 \\frac{R(x)}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\arctan(b x)dx$$ with derivative \n$$J_b \\colon =\\frac{dI_b}{db} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x\\, R(x)}{(1+b^2 x^2)\\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx$$\nand $I_0=0$. The integral $J_b$ is doable if $R$ is a rational function. We get $$I =I_1 = \\int_{0}^1 J_b\\, db$$ This last integral is doable in some cases. In our case $R(x) = \\frac{x^3}{(3-x^2)^2}$ so we get $$J_b = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^4}{(1+b^2 x^2)(3-x^2)^2  \\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx$$ We find first the indefinite integral $$\\int \\frac{x^4}{(1+b^2 x^2)(3-x^2)^2  \\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx $$\nOne can check that it equals\n$$\nF_b(x):=\\frac{3 x \\sqrt{1-x^2}}{4 \\left(1+3 b^2\\right) \\left(-3+x^2\\right)}+\\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\left(-1+b^2\\right) \\text{ArcTan}\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\nx}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right]}{4 \\left(1+3 b^2\\right)^2}+\\frac{\\text{ArcTan}\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{1+b^2} x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right]}{\\sqrt{1+b^2} \\left(1+3 b^2\\right)^2}$$\nIndeed, by direct calculations \n$$F_b'(x) = \\frac{x^4}{(1+b^2 x^2)(3-x^2)^2  \\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$ We get \n$$J_b = F_b(1_{-})- F_b(0) = \\frac{\\left(8-3 \\sqrt{6}(1+b^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right) \\pi }{16 \\sqrt{1+b^2} \\left(1+3 b^2\\right)^2}$$ and therefore \n$$I = I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\left(8-3 \\sqrt{6}(1+b^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right) \\pi }{16 \\sqrt{1+b^2} \\left(1+3 b^2\\right)^2} db = \\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{2}}{192}\\cdot (\\,18 - 6 \\sqrt{3} - \\pi) $$ This approach works for all integrals of form $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{R(x)}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\arctan(b x)dx=\\int_0^1 \\frac{x \\, Q(x^2)}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\arctan(x) dx$$ where $R(x) = xQ(x^2)$ is an odd rational function.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let's start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is asking to prove a specific integral equals a given expression involving pi and sqrt(3). The integral is from 0 to 1 of [x^3 arctan x divided by (3 - x^2)^2] times [dx over sqrt(1 - x^2)], and the result is supposed to be (pi sqrt(2)/192)(18 - pi -6 sqrt(3)).\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The user mentioned the example where assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this integral problem, the assumptions are about the integral's limits, the integrand, and any conditions necessary for the integral to hold.\n\nLooking at the integral:\n\n- The integration variable is x.\n- The limits of integration are from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is (x^3 arctan x) / (3 - x^2)^2 multiplied by 1/sqrt(1 - x^2).\n- The integrand involves arctan x, which is defined for all real x, but here x is between 0 and 1, so arctan x is well-defined.\n- The denominator (3 - x^2)^2 is also safe because x^2 ranges from 0 to 1, so 3 - x^2 is always positive, so no division by zero.\n- The term sqrt(1 - x^2) in the denominator is valid since x is between 0 and 1, so 1 - x^2 is non-negative, and sqrt is defined and positive, except at x=1 where it's zero. But the integral is up to 1, so we need to check if the integral converges there. However, since the original problem states it's equal to that expression, it's assumed that the integral is convergent.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n- x is a real variable in the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is defined as given, with all components valid in [0,1).\n- The integral is convergent at the upper limit x=1.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse that.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption 1: The integral is taken over x in [0, 1].\n\nAssumption 2: The integrand is composed of functions that are defined and continuous on (0,1), with possible consideration at endpoints.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. The original problem doesn't state any conditions; it just presents the integral. So maybe the main assumption is about the integral limits and the integrand's definition. However, since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumptions would be the necessary conditions that make the integral valid. But in the example, the assumption included n being an integer, which was part of the problem statement. Here, the problem statement is just the integral, so perhaps the only assumption is the integral is from 0 to 1 with the given integrand.\n\nWait, the user's example had assumptions that were part of the problem. In the original problem here, the integral is already specified with all the components, so maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's structure. But the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user made an error in the example? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should not include divisibility by 7 unless it's part of the problem. Wait, perhaps the example is illustrative but not accurate. Anyway, perhaps the user's example is not to be taken as a perfect model but just an example of formatting.\n\nBut in the current problem, the integral is given with all the components. The original problem is just to prove that integral equals that expression. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's components. However, sometimes for integrals, assumptions might include that the integral converges, or that certain substitutions are valid, but in the problem statement, those are usually part of the problem's context.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that the formatted assumption is actually more restrictive than the original problem. That seems like an error. Unless the original problem was mistyped. But perhaps the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are extracted from the problem even if they are not explicit. Maybe in that example, the problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the original statement said \"for every integer n\", which might be a mistake. So the formatted problem corrects that by adding assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the integral is stated as is. The problem is to prove that this specific integral equals the given value. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which the integral is valid. But since the problem is presented as is, maybe there are no additional assumptions besides the integral's setup. However, sometimes in integral proofs, certain substitutions or techniques require conditions, but those are part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the integrand is defined and the integral converges. But since the problem states the integral equals that expression, it's implied that the integral exists. So maybe the only assumption is the integral setup.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they extracted assumptions even from the problem statement. For the current problem, maybe the only assumption is the integral is from 0 to 1 with the given integrand. However, the user wants each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut that's part of the problem statement. Alternatively, breaking down the integrand:\n\nAssumption: x is in the interval [0, 1].\n\nBut that's part of the integral's limits. The problem is to compute the integral from 0 to 1. So maybe there are no separate assumptions beyond what's given in the problem. However, the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement. So perhaps following that, list the components:\n\nBut in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was converted into an assumption that n is an integer, and added another assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. But perhaps the user intended that when structuring the problem, they list all the necessary conditions, even if some are part of the problem's wording.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the correct assumption should be that n is an integer divisible by both 7 and 13? But the example only mentions divisible by 7. That suggests the example might have an error.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, the only assumption is that the integral is as stated, and perhaps no additional assumptions. But the user's format requires listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem again: the integrand has arctan x, which is fine for x in [0,1]. The denominator (3 - x^2)^2 is never zero in [0,1], since x^2 <=1, so 3 - x^2 >=2. The sqrt(1 - x^2) is in the denominator, so as x approaches 1, sqrt(1 -x^2) approaches 0, making the integrand blow up. So the integral has a singularity at x=1. Therefore, the convergence at x=1 is an assumption. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The integral converges at x=1.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the integral is given as equal to that finite value, so convergence is implied. But perhaps it's an assumption that the integral is convergent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the integral under the assumption that it converges. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumption included conditions on n beyond what was in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the assistant is supposed to extract implicit assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should not add assumptions not present in the problem. Since the original problem is just to prove the integral equals that value, the only assumption is the integral's definition.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they took \"for every integer n\" and turned it into \"n is an integer\", which is redundant, but also added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, or that the user wants to include conditions that are necessary for the proof, even if not stated. But that seems risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example had a typo, and the original problem was supposed to have n divisible by 7, but was mistyped. Given that 91=7*13, and the expression being divisible by 91, the assumption should be that n is divisible by both 7 and 13, or that the expression holds for all integers n, which might require a different approach. But the example's formatted problem includes n divisible by 7, suggesting perhaps the original problem had a mistake.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are just the integral's components. Since the problem is to compute the integral from 0 to 1 with that integrand, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The variable of integration is x.\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is defined as \\(\\frac{x^3 \\arctan x}{(3 - x^2)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\).\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, 1],\nx is a real variable,\nthe integrand is \\(\\frac{x^3 \\arctan x}{(3 - x^2)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\),\nthe integral converges.\n\nBut I need to check if each of these is one property/condition per line.\n\nAlternatively, considering the example, where assumptions were about n, here the assumptions could be:\n\n- The integration variable x ranges from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is \\(\\frac{x^3 \\arctan x}{(3 - x^2)^2 \\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\).\n- The integral is convergent.\n\nBut the problem statement already includes the integral from 0 to 1 and the integrand, so perhaps these are not assumptions but part of the problem statement. However, in the example, the assumptions included n being an integer, which was part of the original problem's statement. So perhaps the format requires extracting the conditions from the problem statement and listing them as assumptions.\n\nSo, following the example's approach, even if redundant:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{x^3 \\arctan x}{(3 - x^2)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\).\n\nThen the problem is to prove it equals that expression.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they took the original problem's conditions and listed them as assumptions. So in the current case, the assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand's form. But the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That suggests that the example's assumptions were incorrect, but following that pattern, here the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{x^3 \\arctan x}{(3 - x^2)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\).\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Since the problem is to compute the integral, the assumptions are the integral's components. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integration is performed over x from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{x^3 \\arctan x}{(3 - x^2)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\).\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals \\(\\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{2}}{192}(18 - \\pi - 6\\sqrt{3})\\).\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real variable in the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{x^3 \\arctan x}{(3 - x^2)^2 \\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\).\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals \\(\\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{2}}{192}(18 - \\pi - 6\\sqrt{3})\\).\n\nYes, that seems reasonable. Each assumption is a single condition, applied to one object (x and the integrand).",
