    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem about the variance of a continuous uniform distribution. The user wants a proof or derivation showing that the variance is (b - a)^2 / 12. Hmm, I remember that for continuous distributions, variance is the expected value of (X - μ)^2, where μ is the mean. First, I need to recall the probability density function (pdf) of the uniform distribution. \n\nThe uniform distribution on [a, b] has a pdf that's constant in the interval [a, b] and zero outside. The pdf should be 1/(b - a) because the integral over [a, b] must equal 1. Right, so f(x) = 1/(b - a) for a ≤ x ≤ b. \n\nNext, the mean (μ) of a uniform distribution is (a + b)/2. That’s straightforward since it's the midpoint of the interval. To find the variance, I need to compute E[(X - μ)^2], which expands to E[X^2] - (E[X])^2. That might be easier because calculating E[X^2] and then subtracting the square of the mean could be simpler.\n\nLet me compute E[X^2] first. For a continuous distribution, E[X^2] is the integral from a to b of x^2 * f(x) dx. Substituting f(x) here, that becomes the integral of x^2 * [1/(b - a)] dx from a to b. So factoring out 1/(b - a), the integral of x^2 dx is (x^3)/3 evaluated from a to b. Therefore, E[X^2] = [ (b^3 - a^3) / 3 ] / (b - a). \n\nSimplifying that expression, note that b^3 - a^3 factors into (b - a)(b^2 + ab + a^2). So dividing by (b - a) gives (b^2 + ab + a^2)/3. Therefore, E[X^2] = (b^2 + ab + a^2)/3.\n\nNow, the variance is E[X^2] - (E[X])^2. We know E[X] is (a + b)/2, so (E[X])^2 is [(a + b)/2]^2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)/4. \n\nSubtracting these gives Variance = (b^2 + ab + a^2)/3 - (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)/4. To combine these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12. Multiply the first term by 4/4 and the second by 3/3:\n\nVariance = [4(b^2 + ab + a^2) - 3(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)] / 12\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n4b^2 + 4ab + 4a^2 - 3a^2 - 6ab - 3b^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(4a^2 - 3a^2) + (4ab - 6ab) + (4b^2 - 3b^2) = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) which factors into (a - b)^2. Therefore, Variance = (a - b)^2 / 12. But since (a - b)^2 is the same as (b - a)^2, we can write it as (b - a)^2 / 12. That matches the formula given in the problem. \n\nWait, let me check if I made any mistakes in the algebra. Let me recheck the expansion:\n\n4(b² + ab + a²) = 4b² + 4ab + 4a²\n\n3(a² + 2ab + b²) = 3a² + 6ab + 3b²\n\nSubtracting: 4b² +4ab +4a² -3a² -6ab -3b² = (4a² -3a²) + (4ab -6ab) + (4b² -3b²) = a² -2ab +b². Yes, that's correct. And (a - b)^2 is indeed a² -2ab +b². So the variance is (b - a)^2 /12. \n\nTherefore, the derivation checks out. The key steps were computing E[X^2] correctly, then subtracting the square of the mean, and simplifying the algebraic expression properly. This shows that the variance of the uniform distribution on [a, b] is (b - a)^2 /12.",
