    "Content": "I found that the series $$s(n) = \\frac{2}{n} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{i-\\frac{1}{2}}-1}$$ converges to $\\pi$ as $n \\to \\infty$ .\nTo verify this I have computed some values: $n$ $s(n)$ $10^1$ 2.76098 $10^3$ 3.10333 $10^5$ 3.13776 $10^6$ 3.14038 $10^7$ 3.14121 Which seems to support the claim, however, this is no proof of the convergence. I would not know how to begin on a proof of this limit and did not find any similar formula in known approximation formulas . Does anyone have an idea on how such a proof can be constructed?",

No need for fancy convergence theorems here! Using the difference of two squares we can bound, for every $k\\ge1$ and every $n>k$ : $$\\begin{align}0&\\le\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k-\\frac{1}{2}}-1}-\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k}-1}\\\\&=\\frac{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2n}}{\\frac{k}{n}\\left(\\frac{k}{n}-\\frac{1}{2n}\\right)}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k-\\frac{1}{2}}-1}+\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k}-1}}\\\\&\\le\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{n-k}}\\cdot\\frac{n}{k(2k-1)}\\\\&=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{(2k-1)\\sqrt{k(1-k/n)}}\\\\&\\le\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2k\\sqrt{k(1-k/n)}}\\end{align}$$ Summing in $k$ and dividing by $n$ finds: $$0\\le S_n\\le\\frac{1}{n\\sqrt{2n-1}}+\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{k\\sqrt{k(1-k/n)}}$$ Estimating the sum explicitly is a little fiddly. The map $x\\mapsto\\frac{1}{x\\sqrt{x(1-x/n)}}$ is convex. It is initially decreasing but then increases after $x=3n/4$ . If $m$ is the floor of $3n/4$ and $n$ is considered large, we can put: $$\\begin{align}\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{k\\sqrt{k(1-k/n)}}&=\\sum_{k=1}^m\\frac{1}{k\\sqrt{k(1-k/n)}}+\\sum_{k=m+1}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{k\\sqrt{k(1-k/n)}}\\\\&\\le\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-1/n}}+\\int_1^m\\frac{1}{x\\sqrt{x(1-x/n)}}\\d x\\\\&+\\int_{m+1}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{x\\sqrt{x(1-x/n)}}\\d x+\\frac{1}{(n-1)\\sqrt{1-1/n}}\\\\&<(1-1/n)^{-3/2}+\\int_1^{n-1}\\frac{1}{x\\sqrt{x(1-x/n)}}\\d x\\\\&=(1-1/n)^{-3/2}+\\frac{2(n-2)}{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}}\\end{align}$$ Overall I get: $$0<S_n<\\frac{1}{n\\sqrt{2n-1}}+\\frac{n}{2(n-1)\\sqrt{n-1}}+\\frac{n-2}{n\\sqrt{n-1}}$$ When $n$ is large enough that $m<n-2$ , e.g. this is for sure when $n>12$ . By the squeeze theorem, it is now clear that $S_n$ vanishes - as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user has a sequence defined as s(n) = (2/n) * sum from i=1 to n of sqrt(n/(i - 1/2) - 1), and they conjecture that this converges to π as n approaches infinity. The numerical values provided do seem to approach π, so the claim is plausible. But how to prove it?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the sequence. Let's break down the expression inside the sum. The term inside the square root is [n/(i - 1/2) - 1]. Let's rewrite that as [n/(i - 1/2) - 1] = [n - (i - 1/2)]/(i - 1/2) = [n - i + 1/2]/(i - 1/2). So sqrt([n - i + 1/2]/(i - 1/2)).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to analyze this. Let's consider the index i. When i goes from 1 to n, the term (i - 1/2) goes from 0.5 to n - 0.5. So n/(i - 1/2) decreases from 2n to about 1/(n - 0.5) which is roughly 1/n for large n. But subtracting 1 gives us sqrt(n/(i - 1/2) - 1) = sqrt([n - (i - 1/2)]/(i - 1/2)) = sqrt((n - i + 1/2)/(i - 1/2)).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe we can perform a substitution to make it look like a Riemann sum. Riemann sums are usually sums of the form (1/n) * sum f(i/n), which approximates the integral of f(x) from 0 to 1. Let's see if we can manipulate the given sum into such a form.\n\nLet's let x_i = (i - 1/2)/n. Then as n becomes large, x_i ranges from approximately 0 to 1, with each x_i spaced by 1/n. So this is similar to a midpoint Riemann sum, where each sample point is at the midpoint of the subinterval. That is, when we partition [0,1] into n intervals, each of width 1/n, the midpoint of the k-th interval is (k - 1/2)/n. So x_i = (i - 1/2)/n.\n\nLet's substitute this into the expression inside the sum. Then we have:\n\nsqrt(n/(i - 1/2) - 1) = sqrt(1/x_i - 1) = sqrt((1 - x_i)/x_i).\n\nSo the term inside the sum becomes sqrt((1 - x_i)/x_i), and the sum is multiplied by 2/n. Therefore, s(n) = (2/n) * sum_{i=1}^n sqrt((1 - x_i)/x_i), where x_i = (i - 1/2)/n.\n\nBut since x_i is a midpoint Riemann sum, as n approaches infinity, the sum (1/n) * sum_{i=1}^n sqrt((1 - x_i)/x_i) approximates the integral from 0 to 1 of sqrt((1 - x)/x) dx. Therefore, s(n) = 2 * [integral from 0 to 1 sqrt((1 - x)/x) dx + error term]. If the error term goes to zero as n approaches infinity, then s(n) converges to 2 times the integral.\n\nSo the key now is to compute the integral of sqrt((1 - x)/x) from 0 to 1. Let's compute that. Let me make substitution x = sin^2θ, so that 1 - x = cos^2θ, and dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then sqrt((1 - x)/x) = sqrt(cos^2θ / sin^2θ) = cotθ. The integral becomes ∫ cotθ * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. The limits when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2.\n\nSimplifying the integrand: cotθ * 2 sinθ cosθ = 2 cosθ * cosθ = 2 cos²θ dθ. Therefore, the integral becomes 2 ∫ cos²θ dθ from 0 to π/2.\n\nThe integral of cos²θ is (θ + sinθ cosθ)/2. Evaluating from 0 to π/2 gives [(π/2 + 0) - (0 + 0)]/2 = π/4. Then multiplying by 2 gives 2*(π/4) = π/2. Therefore, the integral from 0 to1 of sqrt((1 - x)/x) dx = π/2. Hence, 2 times that integral is π. So s(n) approaches 2*(π/2) = π as n→infty. Therefore, the conjecture is correct.\n\nBut wait, let's check if the substitution is correct. Let me compute the integral again. Let me try substitution x = t^2, then dx = 2t dt. But maybe another way. Alternatively, recognize that the integral ∫ sqrt((1 - x)/x) dx from 0 to1 is the Beta function. In general, ∫ x^{c - 1} (1 - x)^{d - 1} dx from 0 to1 is B(c, d) = Γ(c)Γ(d)/Γ(c + d). Here, sqrt((1 - x)/x) = (1 - x)^{1/2} x^{-1/2}, so c = 1/2, d = 3/2. Therefore, B(1/2, 3/2) = Γ(1/2)Γ(3/2)/Γ(2). Γ(1/2) is sqrt(π), Γ(3/2) is (1/2)sqrt(π), Γ(2) is 1!. So B(1/2, 3/2) = sqrt(π)*(sqrt(π)/2)/1 = π/2. So the integral is π/2, and 2*(π/2) = π. Therefore, yes, the limit is indeed π.\n\nTherefore, the proof involves recognizing the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of the integral, computing the integral, and showing that the error term vanishes as n approaches infinity. The convergence should then follow from the properties of Riemann sums converging to integrals as the partition becomes finer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Recognize that s(n) can be written as a Riemann sum for the integral 2∫₀¹ sqrt((1 - x)/x) dx.\n\n2. Compute the integral and find it equals π.\n\n3. Argue that the error between the Riemann sum and the integral tends to zero as n→infty.\n\nThus, the limit is π.",
