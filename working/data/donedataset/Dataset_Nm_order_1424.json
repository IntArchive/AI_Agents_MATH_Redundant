    "Content": "This is 5.18 from Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right: Theorem : Suppose $T \\in L(V)$ has an upper-triangular matrix with respect to some basis of $V$ . Then the eigenvalues of $T$ consist\nprecisely of the entries on the diagonal of that upper-triangular\nmatrix. Proof: Suppose $(v_1, \\ldots , v_n)$ is a basis of $V$ with respect to which $T$ has an upper-triangular matrix where the diagonal entries are $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ . Let $\\lambda \\in F$ Then for matrix $M(T - \\lambda I$ ) where the diagonal entries are $\\lambda_1 - \\lambda, \\ldots \\lambda_n - \\lambda.$ We can suppose we\nare dealing with complex vector spaces. From 5.16, where it has proven\nthat $T$ is not invertible iff one of the $\\lambda_k$ 's equals $0$ .\nHence $T - λI$ is not invertible if and only if $λ$ equals one of the $λ_j$ 's. In other words, $λ$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ if and only if $λ$ equals one of the $λ_j$ s, as desired. Question: This only showed that one of the diagonal entries is an eigenvalue but not all of them, as the theorem claimed.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I understand why this idiom (which is common in math writing) might seem confusing, but what the author is saying is correct. When he says that $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ if and only if $\\lambda$ equals one of the $\\lambda_j$'s he means that $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ if and only if $\\lambda\\in\\{\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n\\}$ or, to phrase it another way, $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ if and only if $\\lambda=\\lambda_1$, or $\\lambda=\\lambda_2$, ..., or $\\lambda=\\lambda_n$ Thus, if I set $\\lambda$ equal to $\\lambda_1$, the right side of the biconditional is true, so that $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ when $\\lambda=\\lambda_1$; and similarly with all of the diagonal entries $\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about Axler's proof that the eigenvalues of an operator T are precisely the diagonal entries of its upper-triangular matrix. The user is confused because they think the proof only shows that one diagonal entry is an eigenvalue, not all.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Let's parse the problem statement. The theorem states that if T has an upper-triangular matrix with respect to some basis, then the eigenvalues are exactly the diagonal entries. The proof provided in Axler's book uses the fact that T - λI is not invertible if and only if λ equals one of the λ_j's (the diagonal entries). The user's question is challenging this, saying the proof only shows one direction.\n\nSo, assumptions from the problem: \n1. T is in L(V), meaning it's a linear operator on V.\n2. There exists a basis of V with respect to which T has an upper-triangular matrix.\n3. The diagonal entries of this matrix are λ_1, ..., λ_n.\n4. The field F might be complex since the proof mentions complex vector spaces.\n5. The proof references 5.16, which states T is invertible iff none of the λ_k are zero.\n\nWait, the user's problem says \"We can suppose we are dealing with complex vector spaces,\" which might be an assumption in the proof. But Axler's book usually works over complex spaces when using upper-triangular matrices because of the existence of eigenvalues. So maybe that's an assumption here.\n\nBut the user's main issue is that they think the proof only shows that each λ_j is an eigenvalue, but the user misunderstands, thinking the proof only shows one of them. The actual proof shows equivalence: T - λI is not invertible iff λ is one of the λ_j's. Therefore, eigenvalues are exactly the λ_j's. But the user's confusion is about why all diagonal entries are covered.\n\nSo, to structure the problem as per the user's example:\n\nAssumptions should be each on one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\n- T is a linear operator on a vector space V (T ∈ L(V)).\n- There exists a basis of V such that the matrix of T with respect to this basis is upper-triangular.\n- The diagonal entries of this upper-triangular matrix are λ₁, ..., λₙ.\n- The vector space V is over the complex numbers (since the proof mentions complex vector spaces).\n- A previous result (5.16) states that an operator is invertible if and only if none of the diagonal entries in its upper-triangular matrix are zero.\n\nThe problem is then to reconcile the proof given with the theorem's statement, specifically addressing why all diagonal entries are eigenvalues, not just one. So the Problem part would be: \"Prove that the eigenvalues of T consist precisely of the entries on the diagonal of its upper-triangular matrix, given that the proof shows T - λI is not invertible if and only if λ equals one of the diagonal entries.\"\n\nWait, but the user's original problem is more about the question posed by the user on Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking why the proof shows that one of the diagonal entries is an eigenvalue, but not all. So the problem here is explaining why the proof actually does cover all eigenvalues being the diagonal entries.\n\nBut according to the user's format, the \"Problem\" part should be the actual problem statement from the original question. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal title: Proof that Eigenvalues are the Diagonal Entries of the Upper-Triangular Matrix in Axler\n\nQuestion body: The user quotes theorem 5.18 from Axler, which states that eigenvalues are precisely the diagonal entries. The proof provided shows that T - λI is not invertible iff λ is one of the diagonal entries. The user's question is that this proof only showed one direction, i.e., that one of the diagonal entries is an eigenvalue, not all.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture this. The assumptions would be the conditions under which the theorem is stated, and the problem is the user's confusion about the proof not covering all diagonal entries.\n\nSo, in the user's example, the assumptions were the problem's conditions. Here, the theorem's conditions are:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- T is a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space V.\n- There exists a basis of V with respect to which T has an upper-triangular matrix.\n- The diagonal entries of this upper-triangular matrix are λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ.\n- The field is the complex numbers (since Axler often assumes complex for upper-triangular matrices).\n\nProblem: The user is questioning the proof, stating that it only shows that one of the diagonal entries is an eigenvalue, not all of them. Therefore, the problem is to explain why the proof actually shows that all diagonal entries are eigenvalues, addressing the user's confusion.\n\nBut according to the user's required format, the \"Problem\" part should be the problem as presented, not the user's confusion. Wait, looking back at the example given:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem lists the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So here, the problem should be the theorem's statement, and the assumptions are the theorem's conditions.\n\nBut in the user's question, the original problem is the user's confusion about the proof. So maybe the problem here is the user's question: why does the proof show that all diagonal entries are eigenvalues, given that the user thinks it only shows one?\n\nBut the user's format example extracted the problem's mathematical statement and its assumptions. So in this case, the problem is the theorem statement, and the user's confusion is part of the original question, but when structuring, we need to present the assumptions and the problem as per the theorem.\n\nWait, but the user is asking to structure the problem presented in the Math Stack Exchange question. The MSE question is about understanding why the proof works, given the user's confusion. So how to fit that into the format?\n\nThe user's example was taking the original problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) and structured the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and problem. Similarly, here, the original problem is the theorem from Axler, and the user's question is a confusion about the proof. But according to the task, we need to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated info.\n\nSo the problem here is the theorem statement: Prove that the eigenvalues of T are precisely the diagonal entries of the upper-triangular matrix. The assumptions would be the conditions of the theorem: T is a linear operator, there exists a basis where T is upper-triangular, over complex space (if required), etc.\n\nBut the user's confusion is part of their question, but in structuring the problem, we need to present the theorem's conditions and the problem statement. However, the user's actual question is challenging the proof's validity. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nSo the Math Stack Exchange question is: The user is questioning the proof, thinking it only shows one eigenvalue is a diagonal entry, but not all. The problem they are facing is understanding why the proof shows all diagonal entries are eigenvalues.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem is the mathematical problem to solve. So perhaps in this case, the problem is the theorem statement, and the assumptions are the conditions of the theorem, plus any additional context from the proof (like working over complex numbers). Then the user's question is their confusion, but according to the format, we need to present the problem as the theorem to prove, with its assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as posed by the user is their specific question, i.e., \"Why does the proof show that all diagonal entries are eigenvalues, when it seems to only show one?\" But the example given by the user structures the problem as the mathematical problem to solve (prove divisibility by 91), not the user's meta-question about understanding the proof.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the user's example again. In their example, the original problem was a divisibility question, and they structured it with assumptions (n is integer, divisible by 7) and problem (prove A(n) divisible by 91). The user's own confusion or additional context was not part of the formatted problem.\n\nTherefore, applying that here, the problem is the theorem statement: Prove that the eigenvalues of T are precisely the diagonal entries. The assumptions are the conditions under which the theorem holds: T is a linear operator with an upper-triangular matrix, over a complex space, etc.\n\nThe user's actual question (why does the proof cover all eigenvalues) is their personal confusion, but according to the format, we need to present the mathematical problem (the theorem) and its assumptions.\n\nBut wait, in the original MSE question, the user is quoting the theorem and proof, and then asking why the proof shows that all diagonal entries are eigenvalues. So perhaps the problem here is to explain why the proof establishes that all diagonal entries are eigenvalues, given the user's misunderstanding.\n\nBut the user's format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". In their example, it's the problem statement to prove. In this case, perhaps the problem is the theorem statement, and the assumptions are its conditions. But the user's actual question is about understanding the proof, which might not fit the format. However, the user might want the structured problem to be the theorem's statement and its assumptions, even if the MSE question is a request for explanation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem here is the user's question: \"Why does the proof show that all diagonal entries are eigenvalues, not just one?\" But then the assumptions would be the context of the theorem and proof.\n\nBut given the user's example, I think they want the mathematical problem (theorem) to be the \"Problem\" part, and the assumptions as the theorem's conditions.\n\nThus, for the given MSE question:\n\nAssumption:\n- T is a linear operator on a vector space V (T ∈ L(V)).\n- There exists a basis of V such that the matrix of T with respect to this basis is upper-triangular.\n- The diagonal entries of this upper-triangular matrix are λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ.\n- The vector space V is over the complex numbers (as per the proof's mention of complex spaces).\n- A previous result (5.16) states that an operator with an upper-triangular matrix is invertible if and only if all diagonal entries are non-zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the eigenvalues of T consist precisely of the entries on the diagonal of its upper-triangular matrix.\n\nBut the user's confusion is that they think the proof only shows one eigenvalue is a diagonal entry. However, according to the format, we need to present the theorem's assumptions and problem. The user's personal confusion isn't part of the structured problem but is the context of their question.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list the theorem's assumptions and the problem as per the theorem's statement.",
