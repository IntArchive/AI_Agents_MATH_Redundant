    "Content": "How can I prove that the spectrum of the Laplace operator $$\\Delta: H^2(\\mathbb{R}^N)\\subset L^2(\\mathbb{R}^N)\\rightarrow L^2(\\mathbb{R}^N)$$ is $\\sigma(\\Delta)=[-\\infty,0]$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We determine the resolvent set of $(\\Delta, H^2(\\mathbb{R}^n))$. By definition, the complex number $\\lambda$ belongs to the resolvent set if and only if the following equation (named resolvent equation ) \n$$\\tag{1}\\Delta f -\\lambda f = g$$\nhas a unique solution $f\\in H^2$ for any fixed $g\\in L^2$. The spectrum is the complementary of the resolvent set and its elements are called spectral values . [ EDIT: Summary . Here's two different approaches. The first uses the Fourier transform. The second computes explicitly a set of (generalized) eigenfunctions.] Method 1 . Taking the Fourier transform termwise we see that (1) is equivalent to \n$$(-\\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2 - \\lambda)\\hat{f}=\\hat{g}, $$\nwhich has the unique formal solution \n$$\\tag{2}\\hat{f}=-\\frac{\\hat{g}}{\\lambda+ \\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2}.$$\nEquation (2) determines a solution $f\\in H^2$ of the resolvent equation (1) if and only if $f\\in H^2$, that is \n$$\\tag{3}\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\lambda \\text{ is in the resolvent set }&\\iff& \n(1+\\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2 )\\hat{f} = -\\frac{1+\\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2}{\\lambda+ \\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2}\\hat{g}\\in L^2.\\end{array}$$\nWhen $\\lambda\\notin (-\\infty, 0]$ the function $\\frac{1+\\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2}{\\lambda + \\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2}$ is bounded, so condition (3) is satisfied. Therefore $\\lambda$ belongs to the resolvent set. On the other hand, when $\\lambda\\in (-\\infty, 0]$, the function $\\frac{1+\\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2}{\\lambda + \\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2}$ has a singularity at $\\lvert \\xi \\rvert= -\\sqrt{\\lambda}$. If $\\lambda \\ne 0$ then we write \n$$\n\\frac{1+\\lvert \\xi\\rvert^2}{\\lambda +\\lvert \\xi\\rvert^2}=\\frac{1+\\lvert \\xi\\rvert^2}{\\sqrt{-\\lambda}+\\lvert \\xi\\rvert}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-\\lambda}-\\lvert \\xi\\rvert}.$$\nWe take a function $\\hat{g}$ that is equal to $\\lvert\\sqrt{-\\lambda}-\\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2\\rvert^{-\\frac{N-1}{2}}$ in a neighborhood of the annulus $\\lvert\\xi\\rvert=\\sqrt{-\\lambda}$ and vanishes elsewhere. This function is in $L^2$ but its product against $\\frac{1+\\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2}{\\lambda +\\lvert\\xi\\rvert^2}$ is not, because of the strong singularity around $\\lvert\\xi\\rvert=\\sqrt{-\\lambda}$. Therefore condition (3) is not satisfied and $\\lambda$ is not in the resolvent. The proof that $\\lambda=0$ is not in the resolvent is completely analogous. (Alternatively, one can recall that the spectrum is always a closed set, so if the open half-line $(-\\infty, 0)$ is contained in the spectrum, the value $\\{0\\}$ must be in the spectrum as well). Method 2 (Added in response to Neal's comment below). Here's an alternative computation of the spectrum that determines a system of approximate eigenfunctions (in Weyl's sense). Definition . Let $(A, D(A))$ be a closed operator on a Hilbert space $H$. We say that $f_k\\in D(A)$ is a sequence of approximate eigenfunctions of $A$ relative to $\\lambda\\in \\mathbb{C}$ if the following two conditions are satisfied: The sequence is normalized , meaning that $\\lVert f_k\\rVert =1$ for all indices $k$. It holds that: $\\lVert Af_k-\\lambda f_k\\rVert \\to 0$ as $k\\to \\infty$. If $\\lambda$ admits a sequence of approximate eigenfunctions then it is a spectral value. The converse holds if $\\lambda$ is on the boundary of the spectrum. (For more information see Teschl, Mathematical methods in quantum mechanics , Lemma 2.16 pag.76). In the case at hand the eigenfunction equation \n$$\n \t\\Delta f-\\lambda f=0\n$$ is formally solved by the plane wave profiles $e^{i\\sqrt{-\\lambda}\\xi_0\\cdot x}$, where $\\xi_0$ is a unit vector. However, those profiles have not a finite $L^2$ norm. To circumvent this difficulty we fix a smooth bump function $\\Phi$, normalized so that $\\lVert \\Phi\\rVert_2=1$, and we define \n \\begin{align*}\n f^0_k(x)&=\\frac{1}{k^{N/2}}\\Phi\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right);  \\\\\n f^{\\lambda}_k(x)&=e^{i\\sqrt{-\\lambda}\\xi_0\\cdot x} f^0_k(x).\n \\end{align*}\n Here $\\xi_0\\in \\mathbb{S}^{N-1}$ is arbitrarily chosen. Claim . For any fixed $\\lambda\\in (-\\infty, 0]$ the sequence $f^\\lambda_k$ consists of approximate eigenfunctions of $(\\Delta, H^2)$ relative to the spectral value $\\lambda$. Proof . We consider the case $\\lambda=0$ first. It is obvious that the sequence $f^0_k$ belongs to $H^2$ and that it is normalized. We have\n \\begin{equation*}\n\\lVert \\Delta f^0_k\\rVert_2=\\frac{1}{k^2}\\left\\lVert \\frac{1}{k^{N/2}} \\Delta\\Phi\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right) \\right\\rVert_2 =\\frac{C}{k^2}\\to 0.\n \\end{equation*}\n So $f^0_k$ is a sequence of approximate eigenfunctions. We note also that \n \\begin{equation*}\n\\left\\lVert \\nabla f^0_k\\right\\rVert_2=\\frac{1}{k}\\left\\lVert \\frac{1}{k^{N/2}} \\nabla\\Phi\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right) \\right\\rVert_2\\to 0;\n \\end{equation*}\nthis will be useful later. Now we consider the sequence $f^\\lambda_k$ for a $\\lambda\\in (-\\infty, 0)$. It is again obvious that $f^\\lambda_k$ is normalized and that it belongs to $H^2$. Using the Leibniz formula for the Laplacian (that is, $\\Delta(fg)=\\Delta f g + 2 \\nabla f\\cdot\\nabla g + f \\Delta g$), we compute \n \\begin{equation*}\n \\begin{split}\n \\lVert \\Delta f^\\lambda_k -\\lambda f^\\lambda_k \\rVert_2 &=\\left\\lVert 2\\nabla \\left( e^{i\\sqrt{-\\lambda} \\xi_0\\cdot x}\\right)\\cdot \\nabla f^0_k + e^{i\\sqrt{-\\lambda}\\xi_0\\cdot x} \\Delta f^0_k \\right\\rVert_2 \\\\ \n &\\le2\\sqrt{-\\lambda}\\lVert \\xi_0\\cdot \\nabla f^0_k\\rVert_2 + \\lVert \\Delta f^0_k\\rVert_2 \\\\\n &\\le 2\\sqrt{-\\lambda} \\lVert \\nabla f^0_k\\rVert_2 +\\lVert \\Delta f^0_k\\rVert_2 \\to 0.\n \\end{split}\n \\end{equation*}\n This proves our claim.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original question and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe title of the question is \"How to prove the spectrum of the Laplace operator?\" and the body asks to prove that the spectrum of the Laplace operator Δ, defined as an operator from H²(ℝᴺ) subset of L²(ℝᴺ) to L²(ℝᴺ), is σ(Δ) = (-∞, 0]. \n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the problem, the Laplace operator here is specified as Δ acting between the Sobolev space H²(ℝᴺ) and L²(ℝᴺ). So the assumptions should include the domain and codomain of Δ. The problem is to determine the spectrum, which is given as (-∞, 0]. \n\nWait, the original problem states the spectrum as [−∞,0], but in standard spectral theory, the spectrum is a subset of the complex numbers, and typically for the Laplace operator, it's the interval [0, ∞) in the context of negative definite operators. However, here it's stated as (-∞, 0], which might be due to a sign convention. The user might have a typo, but I should stick to the original question as presented.\n\nAssumptions needed:\n1. The operator Δ is defined as the Laplace operator.\n2. The domain of Δ is H²(ℝᴺ), which is a subset of L²(ℝᴺ).\n3. The codomain of Δ is L²(ℝᴺ).\n4. The problem is set in ℝᴺ for some integer N.\n\nEach assumption should be on a separate line, each addressing one property. The problem is to prove the spectrum is as given.\n\nBut wait, the original problem in the example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions are about the operator's definition and spaces. So for this problem, the assumptions would be the properties of the Laplace operator and the function spaces involved.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nΔ is the Laplace operator,\nΔ has domain H²(ℝᴺ),\nΔ is an operator from H²(ℝᴺ) to L²(ℝᴺ),\nThe space is L²(ℝᴺ).\n\nProblem: Prove that the spectrum σ(Δ) is (-∞, 0].\n\nWait, the original question writes σ(Δ)=[−∞,0]. But usually, the spectrum is a closed set in the real line or complex plane. The interval (-∞, 0] makes sense if the Laplacian is considered as a negative definite operator, but depending on the sign convention. For example, sometimes the Laplacian is taken as negative semidefinite, so its spectrum would be (-∞, 0]. However, another convention might define Δ as positive definite, leading to [0, ∞). But according to the problem statement, it's [−∞,0], which might be a typo, but we should follow exactly as given.\n\nBut wait, in standard notation, the spectrum of the Laplacian on L²(ℝᴺ) is [0, ∞). However, if the operator is defined as -Δ, then the spectrum would be [0, ∞). Wait, maybe the problem has a sign error. But regardless, the user's problem states σ(Δ)=[−∞,0], so we need to stick to that.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Δ: H²(ℝᴺ) ⊂ L²(ℝᴺ) → L²(ℝᴺ) is the Laplace operator.\n\nBut how to break this into single-line assumptions? Each assumption should address one property.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nΔ is the Laplace operator,\nThe domain of Δ is H²(ℝᴺ),\nH²(ℝᴺ) is a subspace of L²(ℝᴺ),\nΔ maps from H²(ℝᴺ) to L²(ℝᴺ).\n\nProblem: Prove that σ(Δ) = [−∞, 0].\n\nBut in the example, the user wrote the assumption lines as separate conditions. So each line is a separate condition. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions.\n\nIn this case, the operator Δ is defined with certain properties. So each part of the definition is an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Δ is the Laplace operator.\n- The domain of Δ is H²(ℝᴺ).\n- H²(ℝᴺ) is a subset of L²(ℝᴺ).\n- Δ is an operator from H²(ℝᴺ) to L²(ℝᴺ).\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. For instance, stating the domain as H²(ℝᴺ) and that it's a subset of L²(ℝᴺ) might be considered two separate assumptions. Alternatively, combining them, but according to the example, each line is a separate assumption.\n\nSo structuring accordingly.\n\nThe problem is to show the spectrum is [−∞,0]. However, in standard terms, the spectrum is a closed subset of the complex plane. The interval [−∞,0] might be a misstatement, but perhaps the user intended (-∞, 0]. So the problem statement in the formatted version should be as given, even if there's a possible typo.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have the assumptions broken down as above and the problem statement as given.",
