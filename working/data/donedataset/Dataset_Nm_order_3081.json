    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified assumption and problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"How to show that the space of polynomials is not complete.\" The question is about proving that the space P[0,1] (all polynomials from [0,1] to R) with the sup norm isn't complete. The user suggests using the sequence p_n(x) = 1 + x + x²/2! + ... + xⁿ/n! which converges to e^x, not a polynomial. They want a more formal proof.\n\nSo, the main goal is to show that P[0,1] with the sup norm is not complete. The key points here are:\n\n1. P[0,1] is the vector space of all real polynomials on [0,1].\n2. The norm given is the sup norm: ||p|| = sup_{t in [0,1]} |p(t)|.\n3. The user proposes a specific Cauchy sequence (p_n) that converges to e^x, which is not a polynomial.\n4. Therefore, since the limit is not in P[0,1], the space is not complete.\n\nNow, translating this into the Assumption and Problem sections. \n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n- The space considered is P[0,1], which consists of all polynomials p: [0,1] → ℝ.\n- The norm on P[0,1] is the supremum norm ||p|| = sup_{t ∈ [0,1]} |p(t)|.\n- The sequence (p_n) is defined by p_n(x) = 1 + x + x²/2! + ... + xⁿ/n!.\n- The sequence (p_n) converges uniformly to e^x on [0,1].\n- e^x is not a polynomial.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, do we need to list all these as assumptions? Let me check the example provided. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", but in the example, the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example had a typo? Hmm, but the user provided that example, so I should follow the structure even if there's an inconsistency.\n\nWait, but perhaps the example was different. Let me check again. The original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because 91 is 13*7, so perhaps the problem was to show divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 6 or something? Or maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, I have to follow the user's instruction, which says that each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the user's question is to show that P[0,1] with the sup norm is not complete. The key assumptions would be:\n\n- P[0,1] is the vector space of all real polynomials on [0,1].\n- The norm is the supremum norm.\n- The sequence p_n is defined as the partial sums of the Taylor series of e^x.\n- The sequence p_n is Cauchy in P[0,1].\n- The limit of p_n is e^x, which is not a polynomial.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user wants to structure the problem part as \"Prove that...\" So maybe the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the actual thing to prove. So the problem here is to show that the space is not complete. So the assumptions would be the setup: the space, the norm, and perhaps the specific sequence. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n (integer, divisible by 7). So in this case, the assumptions would be the properties of the space and the norm, and the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is to show that the space isn't complete. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- P[0,1] is the vector space of all polynomials p: [0,1] → ℝ.\n- P[0,1] is equipped with the norm ||p|| = sup_{t ∈ [0,1]} |p(t)|.\n- The sequence (p_n) in P[0,1] is defined by p_n(x) = 1 + x + x²/2! + ... + xⁿ/n!.\n- The function e^x is not an element of P[0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the normed space P[0,1] is not complete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement should be to show that the given Cauchy sequence does not converge in P[0,1]. But the original problem says \"show that the space... isn't complete\" using the example sequence. So the problem is to show incompleteness, and the assumptions are the setup.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to show the space is not complete, with assumptions on the space, norm, and sequence. So I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nP[0,1] is the vector space of all polynomials p: [0,1] → ℝ,\nP[0,1] is equipped with the norm ||p|| = sup_{t ∈ [0,1]} |p(t)|,\nThe sequence (p_n) is defined by p_n(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n x^k /k!,\nThe sequence (p_n) converges uniformly to e^x on [0,1],\ne^x is not a polynomial.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the normed space P[0,1] is not complete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is more specific: \"Prove that the sequence (p_n) is Cauchy in P[0,1] but does not converge in P[0,1].\" But according to the user's example, the problem statement is the general one. The original problem says \"show that this particular norm on P[0,1] isn't complete\". So the problem is to show incompleteness, using the given sequence as an example. Therefore, the assumptions would include the definition of the space, the norm, the specific sequence, its convergence to e^x, and e^x not being a polynomial. Then the problem is to prove the space isn't complete.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem. Wait, in the example, the assumption included n being an integer and n divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", which was then split into two assumptions. Here, the user's original problem mentions that p_n is a sequence in P[0,1], converges uniformly to e^x, which is not a polynomial, hence the sequence is Cauchy but doesn't converge in P[0,1]. So perhaps the assumptions are the properties of the space, the norm, the sequence, and the convergence to e^x, while the problem is to formally prove that the space isn't complete by showing that this Cauchy sequence doesn't converge.\n\nBut the example's problem statement was more general. Let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like the example might be incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to add extra conditions. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a different condition? Maybe the example had a mistake. But regardless, I need to structure the current problem.\n\nThe user's original question is about showing P[0,1] with sup norm isn't complete. The approach is to use the sequence p_n converging to e^x. So to structure this:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition. So:\n\n- P[0,1] is the vector space of all polynomials p: [0,1] → ℝ.\n- The norm on P[0,1] is given by ||p|| = sup_{t ∈ [0,1]} |p(t)|.\n- The sequence (p_n) in P[0,1] is defined by p_n(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n x^k /k!.\n- The sequence (p_n) converges uniformly to e^x on [0,1].\n- The function e^x is not an element of P[0,1].\n\nProblem: Prove that the normed space P[0,1] is not complete.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to show that (p_n) is a Cauchy sequence in P[0,1] that does not converge in P[0,1], thereby proving incompleteness. But the user's problem is to show the space isn't complete, so the problem statement can be that.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement is more direct: \"Prove that P[0,1] with the sup norm is not complete by showing that the sequence (p_n) is Cauchy but does not converge in P[0,1].\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement was the original goal, with assumptions clarifying the conditions. So in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove P[0,1] is not complete, with assumptions on the space, norm, and sequence.\n\nBut the user's original question says \"I want to show that this particular norm on P[0,1] isn't complete.\" So the main problem is to show incompleteness, using the example sequence. Therefore, the assumptions should set up the space, the norm, the sequence, and the properties of the sequence (like converging to e^x which is not a polynomial). Then the problem is to prove incompleteness.\n\nI think that's the way to structure it. So each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\nP[0,1] is the vector space of all polynomials p: [0,1] → ℝ,\nP[0,1] is equipped with the norm ||p|| = sup_{t ∈ [0,1]} |p(t)|,\nThe sequence (p_n) in P[0,1] is defined by p_n(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n x^k /k!,\nThe sequence (p_n) converges uniformly to e^x on [0,1],\ne^x is not an element of P[0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the normed space P[0,1] is not complete.\n\nBut wait, the uniform convergence of p_n to e^x implies that (p_n) is Cauchy in the sup norm, right? Because in a complete space, every Cauchy sequence converges. Since e^x is not in P[0,1], the sequence is Cauchy but doesn't converge, hence the space isn't complete. But in the assumptions, should we include that (p_n) is Cauchy, or is that part of what needs to be proven?\n\nThe original question states that the user thinks (p_n) is uniformly convergent, hence Cauchy, but needs to prove it more formally. So in the problem, part of the proof would be to show that (p_n) is Cauchy in P[0,1]. Therefore, the assumptions should not include that (p_n) is Cauchy, because that's part of what needs to be shown. Instead, the assumptions would include the definition of the sequence, its convergence to e^x, and e^x not being a polynomial. But the uniform convergence on [0,1] implies that it's Cauchy in the sup norm, which is part of the proof.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions should not include that the sequence is Cauchy, but rather the conditions given. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nP[0,1] is the vector space of all polynomials p: [0,1] → ℝ,\nP[0,1] is equipped with the norm ||p|| = sup_{t ∈ [0,1]} |p(t)|,\nThe sequence (p_n) in P[0,1] is defined by p_n(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n x^k /k!,\nThe function e^x is the uniform limit of (p_n) on [0,1],\ne^x is not an element of P[0,1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that the normed space P[0,1] is not complete.\n\nThen the user has to show that since (p_n) is Cauchy (because it converges uniformly, hence Cauchy in sup norm) and the limit is not in P[0,1], hence the space is not complete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that (p_n) is a Cauchy sequence in P[0,1] that does not converge, hence the space is incomplete. But according to the example, the problem statement is the main goal, and the assumptions are the given conditions. So I think the way I structured it above is correct.",
