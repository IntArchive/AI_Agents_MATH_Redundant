    "Content": "I want a simple proof that $\\zeta$ has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip. The function $$\\xi(s) = \\frac{1}{2} s (s-1) \\pi^{\\tfrac{s}{2}} \\Gamma(\\tfrac{s}{2})\\zeta(s)$$ has exactly the non-trivial zeros of $\\zeta$ as its zeros ($\\Gamma$ cancels all the trivial ones out). It also satisfies the functional equation $\\xi(s) = \\xi(1-s)$. If we assume it has finitely many zeros, what analysis could get a contradiction? I found an outline for a way to do it here but I can't do the details myself: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/13647/why-does-the-riemann-zeta-function-have-non-trivial-zeros/13762#13762",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hardy proved in 1914 that an infinity of zeros were on the critical line ( \"Sur les zéros de la fonction $\\zeta(s)$ de Riemann\" Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences. 1914). Of course other zeros could exist elsewhere in the critical strip. Let's exhibit the main idea starting with the Xi function defined by :\n$$\\Xi(t):=\\xi\\left(\\frac 12+it\\right)=-\\frac 12\\left(t^2+\\frac 14\\right)\\,\\pi^{-\\frac 14-\\frac{it}2}\\,\\Gamma\\left(\\frac 14+\\frac{it}2\\right)\\,\\zeta\\left(\\frac 12+it\\right)$$\n$\\Xi(t)$ is an even integral function of $t$, real for real $t$ because of the functional equation (applied to $s=\\frac 12+it$) :\n$$\\xi(s)=\\frac 12s(s-1)\\pi^{-\\frac s2}\\,\\Gamma\\left(\\frac s2\\right)\\,\\zeta(s)=\\frac 12s(s-1)\\pi^{\\frac {s-1}2}\\,\\Gamma\\left(\\frac {1-s}2\\right)\\,\\zeta(1-s)=\\xi(1-s)$$\nWe observe that a zero of $\\zeta$ on the critical line will give a real zero of $\\,\\Xi(t)$. Now it can be proved (using Ramanujan's $(2.16.2)$ reproduced at the end) that :\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\Xi(t)}{t^2+\\frac 14}\\cos(x t)\\,dt=\\frac{\\pi}2\\left(e^{\\frac x2}-2e^{-\\frac x2}\\psi\\left(e^{-2x}\\right)\\right)$$\nwhere $\\,\\displaystyle \\psi(s):=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty e^{-n^2\\pi s}\\ $ is the theta function used by Riemann Setting $\\ x:=-i\\alpha\\ $ and after $2n$ derivations relatively to $\\alpha$ we get (see Titchmarsh's first proof $10.2$, alternative proofs follow in the book...) : \n$$\\lim_{\\alpha\\to\\frac{\\pi}4}\\,\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\Xi(t)}{t^2+\\frac 14}t^{2n}\\cosh(\\alpha t)\\,dt=\\frac{(-1)^n\\,\\pi\\,\\cos\\bigl(\\frac{\\pi}8\\bigr)}{4^n}$$\nLet's suppose that $\\Xi(t)$ doesn't change sign for $\\,t\\ge T\\,$ then the integral will be uniformly convergent with respect to $\\alpha$ for $0\\le\\alpha\\le\\frac{\\pi}4$ so that, for every $n$, we will have (at the limit) :\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\Xi(t)}{t^2+\\frac 14}t^{2n}\\cosh\\left(\\frac {\\pi t}4\\right)\\,dt=\\frac{(-1)^n\\,\\pi\\,\\cos\\bigl(\\frac{\\pi}8\\bigr)}{4^n}$$ But this is not possible since, from our hypothesis, the left-hand side has the same sign for sufficiently large values of $n$ (c.f. Titchmarsh) while the right part has alternating signs. This proves that $\\Xi(t)$ must change sign infinitely often and that $\\zeta\\left(\\frac 12+it\\right)$ has an infinity of real solutions $t$. Probably not as simple as you hoped but a stronger result!\n$$-$$ From Titchmarsh's book \"The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-function\" p. $35-36\\;$ and $\\;255-258$ :",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example given breaks down the problem into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that the Riemann zeta function has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip. The user mentions the xi function, which is defined in terms of the zeta function, and some of its properties: it has the non-trivial zeros of zeta as its zeros, satisfies the functional equation xi(s) = xi(1-s), and the approach is to assume finitely many zeros and find a contradiction.\n\nSo, the task is to extract the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the question.\n\nThe xi function is given as (1/2)s(s-1)π^(s/2)Γ(s/2)ζ(s). The assumptions here would be:\n- ξ(s) includes the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) as its zeros.\n- Γ function cancels all trivial zeros (but in reality, the trivial zeros of zeta come from the poles of Gamma, so maybe the assumption is that xi(s) has only non-trivial zeros of zeta as zeros).\n- ξ(s) satisfies the functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1-s).\n- Assume ξ(s) has finitely many zeros.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states that ξ(s) has exactly the non-trivial zeros, which is a fact, not an assumption. But in the context of the problem, the user is asking to assume that there are finitely many zeros and derive a contradiction. So maybe the assumptions are the properties of xi(s), and the assumption for contradiction is finite zeros.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included both the properties of the problem (n is an integer) and an additional condition (n divisible by 7). However, in the example, the original problem's assumption was that n is an integer, and the user added an extra assumption. Wait, no—the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. Hmm, maybe the example was incorrect, but perhaps the user wants to list all the given conditions as assumptions.\n\nWait, looking at the example again. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. But the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the example, the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. Maybe that was a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to include both the general condition (n is integer) and the specific divisibility. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo or the example was misrepresented. Anyway, perhaps the key is to list all the given conditions in the problem as assumptions.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user wants to structure the problem as Assumptions and Problem. The problem is to prove that zeta has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip. The approach given is using the xi function and assuming finite zeros to reach a contradiction.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be the properties of xi(s), such as:\n- ξ(s) is defined as (1/2)s(s-1)π^(s/2)Γ(s/2)ζ(s).\n- ξ(s) has exactly the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) as its zeros.\n- ξ(s) satisfies the functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1-s).\n- Assume ξ(s) has finitely many zeros.\n\nBut the problem is to show that ζ has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip. So the problem statement would be: Prove that ζ(s) has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip by assuming ξ(s) has finitely many zeros and deriving a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list each condition. Let's see:\n\nOriginal question mentions:\n- ξ(s) is defined with certain factors.\n- ξ(s) has exactly the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) as its zeros.\n- Γ cancels the trivial zeros.\n- ξ(s) satisfies ξ(s) = ξ(1-s).\n- The approach is to assume finitely many zeros and get a contradiction.\n\nSo, each of these points should be listed as separate assumptions. However, the problem is to prove that ζ has infinitely many non-trivial zeros (in the critical strip). The approach is via the xi function. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. ξ(s) is defined as (1/2)s(s-1)π^(s/2)Γ(s/2)ζ(s).\n2. The zeros of ξ(s) are exactly the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s).\n3. ξ(s) satisfies the functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1-s).\n4. Assume ξ(s) has finitely many zeros.\n\nThen the problem would be to derive a contradiction from these assumptions, thereby proving ζ has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). However, the original problem in the example didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list all given conditions, even if they are part of the problem's setup.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example. The example's assumptions included both the domain (n is integer) and a specific condition (n divisible by 7), even though the original problem was to prove for every integer n. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was an incorrect illustration. But regardless, we have to follow the user's instruction based on their example.\n\nIn their example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that the assumptions include both the general domain and any specific conditions, even if the original problem was for all n. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps that's how the user wants it. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the problem was miswritten. But regardless, we need to apply the user's format to the current problem.\n\nLooking at the current problem: The user wants to prove ζ has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip. The approach is via the xi function. The problem mentions that ξ(s) has the non-trivial zeros of ζ, satisfies the functional equation, and if we assume it has finitely many zeros, how to get a contradiction.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. ξ(s) is defined as (1/2)s(s-1)π^{s/2}Γ(s/2)ζ(s).\n2. The zeros of ξ(s) are exactly the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s).\n3. ξ(s) satisfies ξ(s) = ξ(1-s).\n4. Assume that ξ(s) has finitely many zeros.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each bullet point is one assumption. The problem is to derive a contradiction, which would prove that ζ has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nξ(s) is defined as \\(\\frac{1}{2} s (s-1) \\pi^{\\tfrac{s}{2}} \\Gamma(\\tfrac{s}{2})\\zeta(s)\\),\nThe zeros of ξ(s) are exactly the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s),\nξ(s) satisfies the functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1-s),\nξ(s) has finitely many zeros.\nProblem:\nDerive a contradiction to prove that ζ(s) has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip.\n\nBut the original problem states \"I want a simple proof that ζ has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip.\" So the problem is to prove that, using the properties of ξ(s) and assuming finitely many zeros leads to contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement would be: Prove that ζ(s) has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip by assuming ξ(s) has finitely many zeros and deriving a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem statement is the original question's main goal, with the assumptions listed separately. So in the example, the problem is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumptions being n is integer and n divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user didn't have the n divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a mistake, but the key is to list the assumptions given in the problem and structure them.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to prove ζ has infinitely many zeros. The assumptions given in the problem setup are:\n\n- ξ(s) is defined as ...\n- ξ(s) has non-trivial zeros of ζ as its zeros\n- ξ(s) satisfies ξ(s)=ξ(1-s)\n- Assume ξ(s) has finitely many zeros.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these as assumptions and the problem is to derive a contradiction.\n\nBut the user's example included in the assumption a condition that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect, but perhaps the example was mistyped. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a mistake. But regardless, the current task is to follow the user's instruction and structure the problem as per the example.\n\nSo, the answer would list each of the properties of ξ(s) and the assumption of finitely many zeros as separate assumptions, then the problem is to derive a contradiction, thereby proving ζ has infinitely many zeros.\n\nSo, final answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nξ(s) is defined as \\(\\frac{1}{2} s (s-1) \\pi^{\\tfrac{s}{2}} \\Gamma(\\tfrac{s}{2})\\zeta(s)\\),\nThe zeros of ξ(s) are exactly the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s),\nξ(s) satisfies the functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1-s),\nAssume ξ(s) has finitely many zeros.\nProblem:\nProve that ζ(s) has infinitely many zeros in the critical strip by deriving a contradiction.",
