    "Content": "Let $L$ be a Lie algebra. I have to prove that if $L$ is a simple Lie algebra every bilinear associative form  (e.g. $([x,y],z)= (x,[y,z])$ for all $x,y,z \\in L$) is a multiple of Killing form.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof below is based in the following statement which is valid (at least) for linear spaces $V$ over fields of characteristic $0$ : If $(\\cdot,\\cdot)_1$ and $(\\cdot,\\cdot)_2$ are nondegenerate bilinear forms on $V$ then there is a linear autormorphism $P\\colon V\\to V$ such that $$(v,w)_1=(Pv,w)_2,$$ for all $v,w\\in V$ . Also, we will also use (a consequence of) the Schur's Lemma: If $\\rho\\colon L\\to\\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ is a irreducible representation of the Lie Algebra $L$ (over a algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ ) and $P\\in\\mathrm{GL}(V)$ is such that $$P\\circ\\rho(X) = \\rho(X)\\circ P,$$ for every $X\\in L$ , then $P=\\lambda I$ (where $I$ is the identity function) for some scalar $\\lambda$ . I will assume (as we usually do when we talk about Killing form) that $L$ is a simple Lie algebra over a algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ . Now we begin the proof of the statement: Every bilinear and associative form $(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ on $L$ is a multiple of the Killing form $\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle$ on $L$ . Firstly, we must note that $$L^\\perp:=\\{X\\in L\\colon (X,Y)=0\\text{ for all }Y\\in L\\}$$ is a ideal of $L$ . In fact, given $X\\in L^\\perp$ and $Y\\in L$ , we have that $$([X,Y],Z)=(X,[Y,Z])=0,$$ for every $Z\\in L$ , and, hence, $[X,Y]\\in L^\\perp$ . So, since $L$ is simple, $L^\\perp=L$ or $0$ . In the first case we already get the result because $L^\\perp=L$ implies that $(\\cdot,\\cdot)=0$ . So, in what follows, let us suppose that $L^\\perp=0$ . It means, that $(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is nondegenerate. The bilinear forms $(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ and $\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle$ are nondegenerate (by the Cartan's Criterion of semisimplicity) on $L$ . So, let $P\\in\\mathrm{GL}(L)$ be such that $$(X,Y)=\\langle P X,Y\\rangle,$$ for every $X$ and $Y\\in L$ . Next, we will show that $$P\\circ\\mathrm{ad}(X)\\circ P^{-1} =\\mathrm{ad}(X),$$ for all $X\\in L$ . Then, we may conclude, from Schur's Lemma, that $P=\\lambda I$ , for some scalar $\\lambda$ and, whence, $$(X,Y)=\\langle P X,Y\\rangle = \\lambda\\langle X,Y\\rangle,$$ for every $X$ and $Y\\in L$ . So, given $X\\in L$ , we have, for every $Y$ and $Z\\in L$ , that $$\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\langle P\\circ\\mathrm{ad}(X)\\circ P^{-1}Y,Z\\rangle & = & ([X,P^{-1}Y],Z) \\\\\n& = & -([P^{-1}Y,X],Z) \\\\\n& = & -(P^{-1}Y,[X,Z]) \\\\\n& = & -\\langle Y,[X,Z]\\rangle \\\\\n& = & -\\langle [Y,X],Z\\rangle \\\\\n& = & \\langle\\mathrm{ad}(X)Y,Z\\rangle.\n\\end{array}$$ Thus, since the Killing form on $L$ is non-degenerate, we have that $P\\circ\\mathrm{ad}(X)\\circ P^{-1} =\\mathrm{ad}(X)$ , for all $X\\in L$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. The original question is about proving that every bilinear associative form in a simple Lie algebra is a multiple of the Killing form. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that L is a simple Lie algebra. Also, there's a bilinear associative form, which has the property that ([x,y],z) = (x,[y,z]) for all x, y, z in L. Each assumption should be a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n1. L is a Lie algebra.\n2. L is a simple Lie algebra.\n3. There exists a bilinear associative form ( , ) on L.\n4. The bilinear form satisfies ([x,y], z) = (x, [y,z]) for all x, y, z in L.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"every bilinear associative form\". So maybe the assumption is that the form is associative, which is defined by that identity. So perhaps the third assumption is redundant because the fourth one defines the associativity. Let me check. The problem states \"every bilinear associative form\", so \"associative\" here is defined by the given condition. Therefore, the bilinear form is associative, which is equivalent to that identity. So maybe we should combine the third and fourth points. But according to the example given, each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: L is a Lie algebra.\nAssumption: L is simple.\nAssumption: There exists a bilinear form ( , ) on L that is associative, i.e., ([x, y], z) = (x, [y, z]) for all x, y, z in L.\n\nBut the user's example split the conditions. For example, in the example, they had two separate assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each line is a separate condition. Similarly, here, maybe break down the conditions. But the associative form is defined by that identity. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: L is a Lie algebra.\nAssumption: L is simple.\nAssumption: There exists a bilinear form ( , ) on L.\nAssumption: The bilinear form satisfies ([x, y], z) = (x, [y, z]) for all x, y, z in L.\n\nBut is the bilinear form's existence an assumption? The problem says \"every bilinear associative form\", so the problem is for any such form, it's a multiple of the Killing form. So the problem is: given that L is a simple Lie algebra, and ( , ) is a bilinear associative form on L, prove that ( , ) is a multiple of the Killing form. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: L is a Lie algebra.\nAssumption: L is simple.\nAssumption: ( , ) is a bilinear associative form on L.\n\nBut the definition of associative form is that ([x,y],z) = (x, [y,z]). So maybe the third assumption is that the form is associative, which is defined by that property. So the third assumption is that the form satisfies that identity. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: L is a Lie algebra.\nAssumption: L is a simple Lie algebra.\nAssumption: ( , ) is a bilinear form on L.\nAssumption: For all x, y, z in L, ([x, y], z) = (x, [y, z]).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that ( , ) is a multiple of the Killing form.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wrote: \"every bilinear associative form (e.g. ([x,y],z)= (x,[y,z]) for all x,y,z ∈ L) is a multiple of Killing form.\" So the condition ([x,y],z) = (x,[y,z]) is part of the definition of the bilinear associative form. So perhaps the assumption is that the form is bilinear and associative (as defined by that identity). Therefore, in the assumptions, the bilinear form is associative, which is characterized by that identity. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: L is a Lie algebra.\nAssumption: L is simple.\nAssumption: There exists a bilinear form ( , ) on L that is associative, i.e., ([x, y], z) = (x, [y, z]) for all x, y, z in L.\n\nBut the user's example separates the properties. For example, in their example, the first assumption is \"n is an integer\", the second \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, maybe we can split \"L is a Lie algebra\" and \"L is simple\" as separate assumptions, and then the third assumption is that the bilinear form is associative (with the condition). However, the problem is about any such form, so the user is to structure the problem as given, not necessarily the solution's context.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Let L be a Lie algebra. I have to prove that if L is a simple Lie algebra every bilinear associative form [...] is a multiple of Killing form.\" So the problem's actual assumptions are:\n\n- L is a Lie algebra.\n\n- L is simple.\n\n- ( , ) is a bilinear associative form on L (i.e., satisfies the given identity).\n\nSo the three assumptions. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: L is a Lie algebra.\n\nAssumption: L is a simple Lie algebra.\n\nAssumption: There exists a bilinear form ( , ) on L that satisfies ([x, y], z) = (x, [y, z]) for all x, y, z in L.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption is a single line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: L is a Lie algebra.\n\nAssumption: L is a simple Lie algebra.\n\nAssumption: There exists a bilinear form ( , ) on L.\n\nAssumption: The bilinear form satisfies ([x, y], z) = (x, [y, z]) for all x, y, z in L.\n\nBut the problem states that the form is associative, which is defined by that identity. Therefore, maybe combining the third and fourth into one assumption. However, the example splits \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", so separate lines. So in this case, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: L is a Lie algebra.\n\nAssumption: L is a simple Lie algebra.\n\nAssumption: ( , ) is a bilinear form on L.\n\nAssumption: For all x, y, z in L, ([x, y], z) = (x, [y, z]).\n\nProblem: Prove that ( , ) is a multiple of the Killing form.\n\nAlternatively, if \"associative\" is considered a single property, but since the user's example breaks down into separate conditions, it's better to split them. So each line is one assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would have four assumptions, as above. But let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem statement: \"Let $L$ be a Lie algebra. I have to prove that if $L$ is a simple Lie algebra every bilinear associative form (e.g. $([x,y],z)= (x,[y,z])$ for all $x,y,z \\in L$) is a multiple of Killing form.\"\n\nSo the problem is: Given that L is a Lie algebra, which is simple, and given a bilinear associative form (defined by that identity), prove that the form is a multiple of the Killing form.\n\nThus, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. L is a Lie algebra.\n\n2. L is a simple Lie algebra.\n\n3. ( , ) is a bilinear form on L.\n\n4. For all x, y, z in L, ([x, y], z) = (x, [y, z]).\n\nProblem: Prove that ( , ) is a multiple of the Killing form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third and fourth are combined as \"the bilinear form is associative (i.e., satisfies...)\", but according to the user's example, each assumption is a separate line. So in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So here, the existence of the bilinear form and its property are separate.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: L is a Lie algebra.\n\nAssumption: L is a simple Lie algebra.\n\nAssumption: ( , ) is a bilinear form on L.\n\nAssumption: For all x, y, z in L, ([x, y], z) = (x, [y, z]).\n\nProblem: Prove that ( , ) is a multiple of the Killing form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third assumption is \"There exists a bilinear form ( , ) on L\", but the problem says \"every bilinear associative form\", so the problem is for any such form. So the problem is stated as: Given L is a simple Lie algebra, and ( , ) is any bilinear form satisfying associativity, prove it's a multiple of the Killing form.\n\nBut the user wants to structure the problem as per the original question. The original question's problem is: \"Prove that if L is a simple Lie algebra every bilinear associative form [...] is a multiple of Killing form.\"\n\nTherefore, the problem is:\n\nGiven that L is a Lie algebra (assumption 1), which is simple (assumption 2), and given a bilinear associative form (assumptions 3 and 4), then the form is a multiple of the Killing form.\n\nThus, the formatted answer would have four assumptions as above.",
