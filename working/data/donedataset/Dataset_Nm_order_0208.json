    "Content": "Suppose we have two short exact sequences in an abelian category\n$$0 \\to A \\mathrel{\\overset{f}{\\to}} B \\mathrel{\\overset{g}{\\to}} C \\to 0 $$\n$$0 \\to A' \\mathrel{\\overset{f'}{\\to}} B' \\mathrel{\\overset{g'}{\\to}} C' \\to 0 $$\nand morphisms $a : A \\to A', b : B \\to B', c : C \\to C'$ making the obvious diagram commute. The snake lemma states that there is then an exact sequence\n$$0 \\to \\ker a \\to \\ker b \\to \\ker c \\to \\operatorname{coker} a \\to \\operatorname{coker} b \\to \\operatorname{coker} c \\to 0$$\nwhere the morphisms between the kernels are induced by $f$ and $g$ while the maps between the cokernels are induced by $f'$ and $g'$. It is not hard to show that the morphisms induced by $f, g, f', g'$ exist, are unique, and that the sequence is exact at $\\ker a, \\ker b, \\operatorname{coker} b, \\operatorname{coker} c$. With the use of a somewhat large diagram shown here , we can even construct the connecting morphism $d : \\ker c \\to \\operatorname{coker} a$. However, I'm stuck showing exactness at $\\ker c$ and $\\operatorname{coker} a$. I thought Freyd might have had an element-free proof in his book, but it turns out he proves it by diagram chasing and invoking the Mitchell embedding theorem [pp. 98–99]. Is there a direct proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can always \"diagram chase\" in any abelian category, without invoking any embedding theorem, using arguments with subobjects, as in MacLane's book. In any case, you can also construct the boundary map as follows: We are given a map $b: B \\to B'$.  Let $B'' \\hookrightarrow B$ denote\nthe preimage in $B$ of $\\ker c$.  (If you want to desribe this in more categorical\nterms, it is the kernel of the composite $B \\to C \\to C'$.) Then the map $B''\\hookrightarrow B \\rightarrow B'$ factors through the monomorphism $A' \\hookrightarrow B'$\n(using the fact that $A' =\\ker(B' \\to C')\\, \\, $).\nThis then induces a map on quotients $ B''/A \\to A'/\\operatorname{im}A$,\nwhich is precisely the desired map $\\ker c \\to\\operatorname{coker}a.$ Checking the various exactness claims is just a matter of using all the relevant universal properties of kernels, cokernels, quotients, etc.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, which includes listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem clearly. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is about proving the snake lemma without a diagram chase. The question describes two short exact sequences in an abelian category with morphisms between them forming a commutative diagram. The snake lemma is stated, and the user is stuck on showing exactness at ker c and coker a. They mention that Freyd's proof uses diagram chasing and the Mitchell embedding theorem, but the user is seeking a direct proof without those methods.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The example given in the problem shows that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse through the problem statement:\n\n1. There are two short exact sequences in an abelian category:\n   - 0 → A → B → C → 0\n   - 0 → A' → B' → C' → 0\n2. There are morphisms a: A → A', b: B → B', c: C → C' making the diagram commute. The commutation means that the squares involving these morphisms and the original exact sequence maps (f, g, f', g') commute.\n3. The problem is about proving the exactness of the snake lemma sequence at ker c and coker a without using a diagram chase or embedding theorems.\n\nSo the assumptions would be each of these conditions. Each line should be a single assumption. Let me list them:\n\n- The category is abelian.\n- There are two short exact sequences: 0 → A → B → C → 0 and 0 → A' → B' → C' → 0.\n- Morphisms a: A → A', b: B → B', c: C → C' exist.\n- The morphisms a, b, c make the diagram commute (but this might be split into each commuting square? Wait, the original problem says \"making the obvious diagram commute.\" So perhaps each commutativity condition is a separate assumption. However, since the problem states \"the obvious diagram commute,\" maybe we can consider the commutativity of the two squares (with f and f', and with g and g') as separate assumptions. But the problem might not specify them individually. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"morphisms a : A → A', b : B → B', c : C → C' making the obvious diagram commute.\" So \"obvious diagram\" refers to the squares involving a, f, f' and b; and similarly for b, g, g' and c. So each of these commutations is a separate condition. But in the problem statement, they are given as part of the setup. Therefore, the assumptions should include these commutativities.\n\nBut how to phrase each as a single line? Let me try:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The working category is abelian.\n- There is a short exact sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0.\n- There is another short exact sequence 0 → A' → B' → C' → 0.\n- There exists a morphism a: A → A'.\n- There exists a morphism b: B → B'.\n- There exists a morphism c: C → C'.\n- The diagram commutes, i.e., b ∘ f = f' ∘ a.\n- The diagram commutes, i.e., c ∘ g = g' ∘ b.\n\nBut the original problem states \"morphisms a : A → A', b : B → B', c : C → C' making the obvious diagram commute.\" So \"obvious diagram\" likely refers to the two squares: the square with A, B, A', B' (a, b, f, f') and the square with B, C, B', C' (b, c, g, g'). Therefore, each of these commuting squares is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, each commutation condition is a separate assumption. So each of these two commutations would be individual assumptions.\n\nSo, compiling all assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The category is abelian.\n- The first short exact sequence is 0 → A → B → C → 0.\n- The second short exact sequence is 0 → A' → B' → C' → 0.\n- There is a morphism a: A → A'.\n- There is a morphism b: B → B'.\n- There is a morphism c: C → C'.\n- The composition b ∘ f equals f' ∘ a.\n- The composition c ∘ g equals g' ∘ b.\n\nEach of these is a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. For example, the category being abelian is one assumption. Each exact sequence is another assumption. Each morphism a, b, c is an assumption. Each commutative square (the two commutations) is an assumption.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove exactness of the snake lemma sequence at ker c and coker a, without using diagram chasing or the Mitchell embedding theorem.\n\nSo the problem part would be: \"Prove that the sequence $$0 \\to \\ker a \\to \\ker b \\to \\ker c \\to \\operatorname{coker} a \\to \\operatorname{coker} b \\to \\operatorname{coker} c \\to 0$$ is exact at $\\ker c$ and $\\operatorname{coker} a$ without using a diagram chase or the Mitchell embedding theorem.\"\n\nBut in the original problem, the user mentions that they can construct the connecting morphism but are stuck on exactness at ker c and coker a. So the problem is about proving exactness at those two points without diagram chasing.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The working category is abelian.\n- There exists a short exact sequence $0 \\to A \\overset{f}{\\to} B \\overset{g}{\\to} C \\to 0$.\n- There exists another short exact sequence $0 \\to A' \\overset{f'}{\\to} B' \\overset{g'}{\\to} C' \\to 0$.\n- There exists a morphism $a: A \\to A'$.\n- There exists a morphism $b: B \\to B'$.\n- There exists a morphism $c: C \\to C'$.\n- The diagram commutes: $b \\circ f = f' \\circ a$.\n- The diagram commutes: $c \\circ g = g' \\circ b$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence\n$$0 \\to \\ker a \\to \\ker b \\to \\ker c \\to \\operatorname{coker} a \\to \\operatorname{coker} b \\to \\operatorname{coker} c \\to 0$$\nis exact at $\\ker c$ and $\\operatorname{coker} a$ without using a diagram chase or the Mitchell embedding theorem.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is a single line addressing one property. The category being abelian is one. Each exact sequence is another. Each morphism is an assumption. Each commutation condition is another. That seems to fit the format. The example given in the user's instruction had multiple assumptions each on their own line, so this should be okay.",
