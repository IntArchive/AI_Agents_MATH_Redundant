    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to format the given question from Math Stack Exchange according to the specified structure. The original problem is about showing that the exponential of two commuting matrices A and B equals the product of their exponentials.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that A and B are n×n matrices that commute, meaning AB = BA. The note mentions that they don't have to be diagonalizable, but that's more of an additional condition rather than an assumption. However, the key assumptions here are about the properties of A and B. Each assumption should be listed line by line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n1. A is an n×n matrix.\n2. B is an n×n matrix.\n3. A and B commute (AB = BA).\n\nThe problem itself is to show that e^{A+B} = e^A e^B under these conditions. I need to make sure that the problem statement is correctly restated, preserving the mathematical expressions. \n\nWait, the original question says \"Note that A and B do NOT have to be diagonalizable.\" Should that be an assumption? The note is probably to clarify that the usual method requiring diagonalization isn't necessary here. But since the problem statement already includes the commuting condition, maybe the note isn't an assumption but just extra info. However, the user's example included an assumption like \"n is divisible by 7\" which was part of the problem's conditions. In this case, the non-requirement of diagonalization is a note, not an assumption. So I shouldn't list that as an assumption. Only the explicit conditions given for the problem.\n\nSo the assumptions are the three points above. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, similarly, the problem has A and B as n×n matrices that commute. Each of these should be separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption: \nA is an n×n matrix,\nB is an n×n matrix,\nA and B commute (AB = BA).\n\nProblem: Show that e^{A+B} = e^A e^B.\n\nYes, that seems right. The note about diagonalizability isn't an assumption, just a clarification, so it's omitted. The key is to filter out unrelated information. The title of the question is \"Show that e^{A+B}=e^A e^B\" and the body adds the commuting condition. So the formatted problem should capture those elements.",
