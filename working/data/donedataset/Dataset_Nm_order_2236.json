    "Content": "I have problems proving the following result: Each $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\forall a,b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\ : \\ f_a(y) := f(a,y), \\ f_b(x) := f(x,b) $ are polynomials is a polynomial with two variables. If I consider $f$ as a function of $x$, then its derivative  $f'(x) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b}(x)$. Similarly if we treat $f$ as a function of $y$. I assume that $f_a(y) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a} (y) $ and $f_b(x)=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b}(x)$. But I am not sure if we can assume that, because  the degree of the derivative should be smaller than the degree of the original function (and it isn't). Actually, I'm not even sure if what I'm trying to prove is true, because in the original formulation of the problems there is written $f_a(y) := (a,y), \\ f_b(x):=(x,b)$. But that didn't make sense. Could you help me here? Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't understand what you say about derivatives and I will assume that you want the following result. Let $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a function such that for every $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $x \\mapsto f(x,b)$ and $y \\mapsto f(a,y)$ are polynomial functions; then $f$ is a polynomial in two variables. This is not obvious because we don't have a good representation of $f$. The idea of the proof is to show that $f$ coincides with a polynomial at sufficiently many points. 1) There exists an infinite set $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ and an integer $N$ such that for any $a,b \\in I$, the polynomials $y \\mapsto f(a,y)$ and $x \\mapsto f(x,b)$ are of degree bounded by $N$. This follows from the fact that $\\mathbb{R}$ is not countable: if $K_n$ is the set of $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x\\mapsto f(x,z)$ and $y \\mapsto f(z,y)$ are of degree bounded by $n$, then $\\cup_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}} K_n = \\mathbb{R}$ and one of the $K_n$ must be infinite (in fact uncountable but I don't need it). 2) Let $I$ and $N$ be as in the previous point. Let $z_1,\\dots,z_{N+1}$ be $N+1$ arbitrary elements in $I$. I claim that there exists a polynomial $Q$ in two variables, of degree in $x$ and $y$ at most $N$ such that $Q$ takes the same values than $f$ in all points of the form $(z_i,z_j)$, for $1 \\leq i,j \\leq N+1$. Indeed, this is the analog of Lagrange interpolation in two variables. This polynomial $Q$ is defined by: $$ Q(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} \\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} f(z_i,z_j) \\prod_{i' \\neq i} \\prod_{j' \\neq j} \\frac{(x-z_{i'})(y-z_{j'})}{(z_i-z_{i'})(z_j-z_{j'})}.$$ 3) I claim that $f(x,y) = Q(x,y)$ everywhere. First, $y \\mapsto f(z_i,y)$ and $y \\mapsto Q(z_i,y)$ are both polynomial of degree bounded by $N$, which coincide in $N+1$ points. This shows that $f = Q$ on sets of the form $z_i \\times \\mathbb{R}$. Now, take any $y$ in $I$. Then $x \\mapsto f(x,y)$ and $x \\mapsto Q(x,y)$ are polynomial of degree bounded by $N$ and they are equal for $x$ equal to one of the $z_i$. So they are equal everywhere. This shows that $f = Q$ on $\\mathbb{R} \\times I$. Finally, consider an arbitrary $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $y \\mapsto f(x,y)$ and $y \\mapsto Q(x,y)$ are both polynomial, equal when $y \\in I$. Since $I$ is infinite, they are equal everywhere. This concludes the proof of $Q = f$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about proving that a function f: ℝ² → ℝ is a polynomial in two variables if, for every a and b in ℝ, the functions f_a(y) = f(a,y) and f_b(x) = f(x,b) are polynomials. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The user initially thought that f_a(y) might be the partial derivative with respect to a, but that doesn't make sense because a is a constant when we fix x = a. So f_a(y) is just f(a,y), which is a polynomial in y. Similarly, f_b(x) = f(x,b) is a polynomial in x. The confusion came from misinterpreting f_a and f_b as derivatives, but they're actually functions obtained by fixing one variable.\n\nSo the problem is: If fixing each variable individually results in a polynomial, then the original function is a polynomial in both variables. That needs to be proven. The user also mentioned something about derivatives, but that seems like a misunderstanding. The key assumptions are that for every a, f(a,y) is a polynomial in y, and for every b, f(x,b) is a polynomial in x. The conclusion is that f itself must be a two-variable polynomial.\n\nI should check if there are any hidden conditions or if the problem might have counterexamples. For example, maybe a function that isn't a polynomial but when sliced along each axis becomes a polynomial. But I recall that if all cross-sections are polynomials, then the function is a polynomial, provided some conditions. This might involve using the fact that polynomials are determined by their coefficients, and if all restrictions are polynomials of bounded degree, then the entire function is a polynomial. However, the problem here allows the degree of f(a,y) to vary with a, so that complicates things.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's for every a and b. So maybe the degrees are actually bounded. Suppose that for each fixed a, f(a,y) is a polynomial in y of degree at most m, and for each fixed b, f(x,b) is a polynomial in x of degree at most n. Then, maybe f is a polynomial of degree at most m+n or something. But the problem doesn't state that the degrees are bounded. So how can we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that if all the cross-sections are polynomials, then f must be a polynomial. For example, in two variables, if f(x,y) is such that for every x, f(x,y) is a polynomial in y, and for every y, it's a polynomial in x, then f is a polynomial in x and y. This seems familiar, but I need to recall the theorem or the proof.\n\nI think one approach is to consider that a polynomial in two variables can be written as a finite sum of monomials. If each horizontal and vertical slice is a polynomial, then the coefficients must eventually stabilize. For example, take f(x,y) and express it as a sum over i,j of c_{i,j} x^i y^j. For fixed x=a, f(a,y) is a polynomial in y, so the coefficients for each power of y must be polynomials in a. Similarly, for fixed y=b, the coefficients for x must be polynomials in b. Then, combining these, the coefficients c_{i,j} must be constants, leading to a finite sum, hence a polynomial.\n\nAnother approach might be induction on the degrees. Suppose that for each a, f(a,y) is a polynomial of degree at most m in y, and for each b, f(x,b) is a polynomial of degree at most n in x. Then, f can be written as a polynomial of degree m in y and n in x. But the problem doesn't specify the degrees, so maybe there's a way to show that the degrees are bounded.\n\nWait, but without bounded degrees, the function could be an infinite series, which isn't a polynomial. However, if for each a, f(a,y) is a polynomial in y, but the degree could depend on a. Similarly for x. But in reality, if f is a polynomial, then the degrees in x and y are fixed. So perhaps if we can show that the degrees of f(a,y) as polynomials in y are bounded independently of a, and similarly for f(x,b), then f is a polynomial.\n\nBut how to show that? Suppose that for some a, the degree of f(a,y) is m, and for some b, the degree of f(x,b) is n. Then, perhaps the function must have total degree m + n? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the ring of polynomials. If f is such that all its evaluations at x=a or y=b are polynomials, then f must be a polynomial. This is true in formal power series, but here we're dealing with functions. For functions, if f is analytic and all cross-sections are polynomials, then f is a polynomial. But does this hold without assuming analyticity?\n\nWait, the problem states f: ℝ² → ℝ. So it's a function from ℝ² to ℝ, not necessarily analytic. But the condition that all slices are polynomials is strong. Maybe we can use the fact that if a function is a polynomial in each variable separately, then it's a polynomial jointly. This might be a theorem in real analysis.\n\nI recall that if a function f(x,y) is such that for each x, f(x,y) is a polynomial in y, and for each y, f(x,y) is a polynomial in x, then f is a polynomial in x and y. The proof involves showing that the degrees in each variable are bounded and then using induction or coefficient comparison.\n\nLet me try to sketch a proof. Suppose that for each fixed x, f(x,y) is a polynomial in y of degree at most m. Then, we can write f(x,y) = c₀(x) + c₁(x)y + ... + c_m(x)y^m. Similarly, for each fixed y, f(x,y) is a polynomial in x of degree at most n, so f(x,y) = d₀(y) + d₁(y)x + ... + d_n(y)x^n. Then, equating these two expressions, we can compare coefficients. For example, c₀(x) must equal d₀(y) when y=0, but c₀(x) is a function of x, and d₀(y) is a function of y. The only way this can be true for all x and y is if c₀(x) is a constant. Similarly, other coefficients must be polynomials in their variables, leading to the conclusion that all c_i(x) are polynomials in x, and their degrees are bounded. Hence, f(x,y) is a polynomial.\n\nBut this is a bit hand-wavy. To formalize it, suppose that for each x, f(x,y) is a polynomial in y of degree m(x). Similarly, for each y, degree n(y) in x. We need to show that m(x) is bounded as x varies, and similarly n(y) is bounded. Suppose not; then there exist x_k such that m(x_k) → ∞. But if f is a polynomial in y for each x, but with degrees growing without bound, then f cannot be expressed as a finite sum, hence not a polynomial. However, the problem states that f is a function from ℝ² to ℝ. But such a function with unbounded degrees in slices would not be a polynomial. Hence, the conclusion is that the degrees must be bounded, hence f is a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, use interpolation. For example, take enough points to determine the coefficients. If for each x, f(x,y) is a polynomial in y of degree m, then we can write f(x,y) = sum_{k=0}^m a_k(x) y^k. Similarly, for each y, sum_{l=0}^n b_l(y) x^l. Then, equate these expressions. The functions a_k(x) must be equal to polynomials in x, as they can be extracted by taking derivatives with respect to y and evaluating at y=0. Similarly, b_l(y) must be polynomials in y. Hence, each a_k(x) is a polynomial in x, and each b_l(y) is a polynomial in y. Therefore, f is a polynomial in x and y.\n\nAnother approach is to use the ring of polynomials. The function f is in ℝ[x,y] if and only if all its evaluations at x=a or y=b are polynomials in the remaining variable. This is a standard result in algebra. The key idea is that if f is not a polynomial, then there would be infinitely many monomials, but each evaluation at x=a would truncate the series, leaving a polynomial. However, if the original function had infinitely many terms, evaluations couldn't all result in finite polynomials unless the original function was a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, suppose f is not a polynomial. Then, there exists an infinite sequence of terms with increasing degrees. But if we fix x=a, then f(a,y) must be a polynomial in y, meaning that beyond some degree, the coefficients (which are functions of a) must be zero. However, if these coefficients are zero for all a, then they are identically zero, contradicting the existence of infinitely many terms. Hence, f must be a polynomial.\n\nThis seems convincing. So the problem reduces to showing that if all cross-sections are polynomials, then the function itself is a polynomial. Therefore, the assumptions are that for every real number a, f(a,y) is a polynomial in y, and for every real number b, f(x,b) is a polynomial in x. The problem is to prove that f is a polynomial in two variables.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The user's original problem mentions that f: ℝ² → ℝ such that for all a,b, f_a(y) = f(a,y) and f_b(x) = f(x,b) are polynomials. The problem is to prove f is a two-variable polynomial. The user had some confusion about derivatives, but that's clarified now. The assumptions should list the conditions on f: that for each a, f(a,y) is a polynomial in y, and for each b, f(x,b) is a polynomial in x. Each assumption should be a separate line, addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℝ² → ℝ,\nFor every a ∈ ℝ, f(a,y) is a polynomial in y,\nFor every b ∈ ℝ, f(x,b) is a polynomial in x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is a polynomial in two variables.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is on its own line and addresses one property. The function f is defined from ℝ² to ℝ. Then, for every a, fixing the first variable gives a polynomial in y. Similarly, for every b, fixing the second variable gives a polynomial in x. These are separate assumptions on the function f.",
