    "Content": "Edit: According to the suggestions in comments, this only holds when f(x) is monic. Let $p$ be a prime number and $f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{p} a_{i}x^{i}$ be a monic polynomial with $a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{p} \\in\\mathbb{Z}$ . Let $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{p}$ be its roots. I am trying to show that the polynomial $$g(x) = \\frac{x^{p} - \\alpha_{1}^{p}}{x - \\alpha_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{x^{p} - \\alpha_{2}^{p}}{x - \\alpha_{2}} \\cdots \\frac{x^{p} - \\alpha_{p}^{p}}{x - \\alpha_{p}}$$ has integer coefficients. My attempt: I managed to show that the polynomial $$h(x) = (x^{p} - \\alpha_{1}^{p})\\cdot (x^{p} - \\alpha_{2}^{p})\\cdots (x^{p} - \\alpha_{p}^{p})$$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients. This is because coefficient of $f(x)$ are values of elementary symmetric polynomial in $p$ variables, evaluated at the roots $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{p}$ and coefficient of $h(x)$ are values of same elementary symmetric polynomial evaluated at $\\alpha_{1}^{p}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{p}^{p}$ . Then I used Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials. My strategy was to show that when I divide $h(x)$ by $(x-\\alpha_{1})\\cdots (x-\\alpha_{p})$ , I get integer polynomial as a result. I thought of doing this partially because it might help me find the coefficents of $g(x)$ too. But now, I am struggling to show that. Are there any other strategy to this problem (preferably that can help me isolate the coefficients of $g(x)$ )?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Under the assumption that $f(x)$ is a monic polynomial, here's a sketch of how one could go about determining the coefficients of this expansion. It should be evident that the expression whose expansion is requested can be written as a polynomial of degree $D=p^2-p$ . We write $$g(x;\\vec{\\alpha})=P(x;\\alpha_1)...P(x;\\alpha_p)=\\sum_{n=0}^D\\Gamma_n(\\vec{\\alpha})x^n$$ where $P(x;r)=\\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}r^{p-1-n}x^n$ It is easy to see by the definition of $g$ that it is invariant under any permutation $S=\\{\\sigma{(1)},...,\\sigma{(p)}\\}$ of the set $\\{\\alpha_1,..., \\alpha_p\\}$ . We readily conclude that the coefficients have the same symmetry: $$\\Gamma_n(S\\vec{\\alpha})=\\Gamma_n(\\vec{\\alpha})$$ Also the coefficients can be shown to obey the very important scaling relation $$\\Gamma_n(\\mu \\vec{\\alpha})=\\mu^{D-n}\\Gamma_n(\\vec{\\alpha})$$ Now, also by the definition of $g$ and simple power counting one should be able to show that the coefficients are polynomials in multiple variables made up only of positive powers of the variables $\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_p$ . This along with the scaling relation and the symmetry requirement suffices to show that the coefficients must be symmetric polynomials of total degree $D-n$ . With this proven, one can now invoke the fundamental theorem of multivariable symmetric polynomials, which asserts that no matter the form of a symmetric polynomial in many variables, it always has an expression in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, and since those can be computed to be integer valued by the assumption that the coefficients of the polynomial with roots $\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_p$ are integers. Therefore, we conclude that $\\Gamma_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ . It takes quite a bit more work to find explicit expressions for the coefficients defined above. Define a basis of symmetric polynomials of total degree $N$ as follows $$s_{N}^{q_1,..., q_p}(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2,... \\alpha_p)=\\sum_{\\text{sym}}\\alpha_1^{q_1}... \\alpha_p^{q_p}~~,~~ \\sum_{i=1}^p q_i=N$$ I conjecture that the coefficients can be expressed as an equal weight linear combination of the polynomials in the basis defined above as follows: $$\\Gamma_n(\\vec{\\alpha})=\\sum_{r\\in R} s^{r}_{D-n}(\\vec{\\alpha})$$ where $r$ is a $p$ -index in the set defined by $$R=\\{(r_1,..., r_p):\\sum_{i=1}^p{r_i}=D-n,0\\leq r_i\\leq p-1 \\}$$ These sets of p-indices can be generated in Mathematica by evoking the function r[p_, n_] :=  Select[IntegerPartitions[p^2 - n, {p}] - Table[Table[1, {i, 1, p}], {j, 1, Length[IntegerPartitions[p^2 - n, {p}]]}], Max[#] <= p - 1 &] Interestingly enough, this symmetric polynomial basis is also good enough to solve the more general problem with $$P(x;r)=\\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}c_{p-1-n} x^n r^{p-1-n}$$ which admits a solution which is a simple generalization of the previous one $$\\Gamma_n(\\vec{\\alpha})=\\sum_{r\\in R} c_{r_1}...c_{r_p}s^{r_1,...,r_p}_{D-n}(\\vec{\\alpha})$$ Note that the coefficients will still be integral if the $c$ 's are integral.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the polynomial g(x), which is the product of terms like (x^p - α_i^p)/(x - α_i) for each root α_i of a monic polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients, has integer coefficients themselves. \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The key points are:\n\n- p is a prime number.\n- f(x) is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. So all coefficients a_i are integers, and the leading coefficient is 1.\n- The roots of f(x) are α_1, α_2, ..., α_p.\n- g(x) is the product of (x^p - α_i^p)/(x - α_i) for each root α_i.\n- We need to show g(x) has integer coefficients.\n\nThe user mentioned they already showed that h(x) = product of (x^p - α_i^p) has integer coefficients. They did this by using the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials, recognizing that h(x)'s coefficients are symmetric in the α_i^p, hence can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials of the α_i, which are integers because f(x) has integer coefficients.\n\nNow, the problem is dividing h(x) by the product (x - α_1)...(x - α_p), which is f(x) since f is monic. So h(x) divided by f(x) gives g(x). The user wants to show that this division results in a polynomial with integer coefficients.\n\nHmm, so h(x) has integer coefficients, f(x) is monic with integer coefficients. If we divide a polynomial with integer coefficients by a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, does the quotient also have integer coefficients? I think that's a theorem. Let me recall. Yes, the division algorithm: if you divide a polynomial A(x) by a monic polynomial B(x) with integer coefficients, the quotient and remainder have integer coefficients. So if f(x) is monic, then h(x) divided by f(x) would give a quotient g(x) with integer coefficients and a remainder. But since each (x^p - α_i^p) is divisible by (x - α_i), because x^p - α_i^p = (x - α_i)(x^{p-1} + x^{p-2}α_i + ... + α_i^{p-1}), then h(x) is divisible by the product of (x - α_i), which is f(x). Therefore, the remainder is zero, so the quotient g(x) must have integer coefficients.\n\nWait, but the user already knows h(x) has integer coefficients and f(x) is monic with integer coefficients. So by polynomial division, since f(x) is monic, the division h(x)/f(x) must result in a polynomial with integer coefficients. Therefore, g(x) has integer coefficients. Is there something missing here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is looking for another approach. Let's see. The product (x^p - α_i^p)/(x - α_i) is equal to x^{p-1} + x^{p-2}α_i + ... + α_i^{p-1}. So g(x) is the product of these expressions for each root α_i. Then, expanding this product, the coefficients of g(x) would be symmetric in the α_i's. Since f(x) is monic with integer coefficients, the elementary symmetric sums of the α_i's are integers. By the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials, any symmetric polynomial in the α_i's with integer coefficients can be expressed as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric sums, hence would result in integers. Therefore, the coefficients of g(x) are integers.\n\nBut maybe this is the same approach the user tried. They might have gotten stuck on the division part. The key insight here is that dividing h(x) by f(x) gives a polynomial with integer coefficients because f(x) is monic. Since h(x) and f(x) both have integer coefficients and f(x) is monic, the division algorithm ensures that the quotient g(x) has integer coefficients. Therefore, the user's initial strategy is valid. Perhaps they need confirmation on this point or another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using modular arithmetic. If we consider the coefficients modulo some prime, but that might complicate things. Another approach could be to note that the coefficients of g(x) are the elementary symmetric sums of the terms (x^{p-1} + x^{p-2}α_i + ... + α_i^{p-1}). Expanding this product would generate symmetric functions in the α_i's, which can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of f(x), hence integers. But this might be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that if α is a root of f(x), then α^p is a root of h(x). Since f(x) is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, maybe using Frobenius endomorphism? In characteristic p, (α + β)^p = α^p + β^p, but we're working over integers. However, the user is dealing with polynomials over integers, so maybe Newton's identities or something related to power sums.\n\nWait, another thought: Since f(x) is monic with integer coefficients, then each α_i is an algebraic integer. The product defining g(x) is a product of cyclotomic-like polynomials evaluated at algebraic integers. Since the product of algebraic integers is an algebraic integer, and symmetric combinations would be rational, hence integers. But I'm not sure if this line of reasoning is helpful here.\n\nBack to the division idea: The key theorem is that if you have a polynomial A(x) with integer coefficients and divide by a monic polynomial B(x) with integer coefficients, then the quotient and remainder have integer coefficients. Since h(x) is divisible by f(x), the remainder is zero, so quotient g(x) must have integer coefficients. This seems straightforward, but maybe the user is not aware of this theorem or needs to verify it.\n\nAlternatively, to make it explicit, suppose h(x) = f(x) * g(x). Since f(x) is monic with integer coefficients, and h(x) has integer coefficients, then by induction on the degree, the coefficients of g(x) must be integers. For example, if you perform polynomial long division, each step involves subtracting multiples of f(x) which is monic, so the leading coefficient of the remainder is canceled by subtracting an integer multiple of f(x), hence the coefficients stay integers.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that g(x) has integer coefficients because h(x) and f(x) are both integer polynomials with f(x) monic, so their quotient is also an integer polynomial.\n\nSo the assumptions here are that p is prime, f is monic with integer coefficients, roots are α_i, and g is constructed as the product of those cyclotomic-like terms. The problem is to show g has integer coefficients. The user's approach is valid, but maybe they need to reference the theorem about division by monic polynomials preserving integer coefficients.",
