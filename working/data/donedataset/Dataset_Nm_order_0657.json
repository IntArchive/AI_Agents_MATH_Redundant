    "AcceptedAnswer": "There do not exist such polynomials which are in addition monic, and I would be surprised if this restriction turned out to be fundamental. Assume that $f, g$ is a monic counterexample. In particular, $\\gcd(f(x), g(x)) = 1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ . If $f$ has repeated roots we can replace it with $\\frac{f}{\\gcd(f, f')}$ and similarly for $g$ , so we may assume WLOG that $f$ and $g$ have no repeated roots and share no roots, so that the product $fg$ has no repeated roots. The key tool is the following weaker version of the Chebotarev density theorem . Theorem ( Frobenius ): Let $q(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be a monic polynomial with no repeated roots. Then the proportion of primes $p$ for which the factorization of $q(x) \\bmod p$ has multiset of degrees $(d_1, d_2, ..., d_n)$ is precisely the proportion of elements of the Galois group $G$ of the splitting field $K$ of $q(x)$ which have cycle type $(d_1, d_2, ..., d_n)$ acting on the roots of $q(x)$ . Corollary: The proportion of primes $p$ for which $q(x) \\bmod p$ is a product of linear factors is $\\frac{1}{|G|}$ ; in particular, infinitely many such primes exist; in particular, at least one such prime exists. Now apply the corollary to $q = fg$ . We conclude that there is a prime $p$ such that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ both split into linear factors $\\bmod p$ ; in particular, the set of integers $n$ for which $f(n) \\equiv 0 \\bmod p$ and the set of integers $m$ for which $g(m) \\equiv 0 \\bmod p$ contain arithmetic progressions, so by picking suitably large $n$ and $m$ the conclusion follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking whether there exist two non-constant polynomials f(x) and g(x) with integer coefficients such that for every pair of integers m and n, the greatest common divisor of f(m) and g(n) is 1. The user suspects there are no such polynomials and wants to know how to prove it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Both polynomials are non-constant, so they must have degrees at least 1. They have integer coefficients, which is important because it affects the values the polynomials can take when evaluated at integer arguments. The key condition is that for any integers m and n, gcd(f(m), g(n)) = 1. That means no matter what integers you plug into f and g, their outputs should share no common divisors other than 1.\n\nLet me start by considering simple cases. Suppose f(x) and g(x) are both linear polynomials. For example, f(x) = ax + b and g(x) = cx + d. Then, maybe by choosing specific coefficients, we could make their outputs coprime. But intuitively, this seems difficult. If I fix m and vary n, or vice versa, the values of the polynomials could take on many different prime factors, so ensuring that none of them ever share a common prime seems challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering prime divisors. If f and g are non-constant, then as m and n vary, f(m) and g(n) will take on infinitely many values. But the primes are infinite, so maybe for each prime p, we can find some m or n such that p divides f(m) or p divides g(n). However, the problem requires that no prime divides both f(m) and g(n) for any m,n. That seems impossible because for any prime p, there should be some m where p divides f(m) (since f is non-constant), and similarly for g(n). Then, if there's a common prime p that divides some f(m) and some g(n), their gcd would be at least p, contradicting the requirement.\n\nBut I need to formalize this intuition. Let's think about using the concept of a common prime divisor. Suppose there exists a prime p that divides f(m) for some integer m. Since f is non-constant, by the polynomial theorem (like the fact that a non-constant polynomial over Z has infinitely many prime divisors?), p divides f(m) for infinitely many m? Or maybe not infinitely, but at least one. Similarly, for g(n), there must exist some n where p divides g(n). If such a prime p exists, then taking that m and n would give gcd(f(m), g(n)) ≥ p > 1, which contradicts the condition.\n\nBut how do we ensure that such a prime p exists that divides both f and g's outputs? Maybe by considering that any non-constant polynomial in Z[x] must take infinitely many prime values or have infinitely many prime factors. Wait, actually, a non-constant polynomial can't take prime values infinitely often unless it's linear (by the Bunyakovsky conjecture, but that's unproven). However, even if f(x) is composite for many x, it's still possible that some prime divides some value of f(x). In fact, for any non-constant polynomial f(x) ∈ Z[x], there are infinitely many primes dividing the values f(m) as m ranges over integers. This is a theorem, I think. For example, a result similar to the one stating that if a polynomial isn't constant, then the set of primes dividing its values is infinite.\n\nIf that's the case, then for f and g being non-constant, there are infinitely many primes dividing their values. But if the set of primes dividing f(m) and those dividing g(n) are non-empty and infinite, there must be some overlap. Otherwise, if their sets of primes are disjoint, that would require f(m) to only have primes from one set and g(n) from another, which is impossible because primes are infinite and you can't partition them into two disjoint infinite sets where neither has primes in common. Wait, but primes are infinite, but maybe you could have two polynomials such that f's primes are all in one subset and g's in another. But I don't think that's possible because for any polynomial, the primes dividing its values are dense in some sense.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that f and g are such that for all m,n, gcd(f(m), g(n))=1. Then, for any prime p, p cannot divide both f(m) and g(n) for any m,n. So p cannot divide any value of f(m) if p divides any value of g(n), and vice versa. But since f is non-constant, there must be some prime p that divides f(m) for some m. Then, that p cannot divide any g(n) for any n. Similarly, for that p, g(n) must never be divisible by p, which would mean that g(x) is never congruent to 0 mod p. But if g(x) is a non-constant polynomial, then unless it's identically 0 mod p (which it can't be because it's non-constant and has integer coefficients), there must be some x where g(x) ≡ 0 mod p. By the fact that a non-constant polynomial over a field (like Z/pZ) has at most deg g roots. So if p doesn't divide the leading coefficient of g, then g(x) ≡ 0 mod p has at most deg g solutions. But since we can take n ≡ x mod p for some x where g(x) ≡ 0 mod p, then there exists n such that g(n) ≡ 0 mod p. Therefore, such a prime p that divides f(m) for some m must divide some g(n), leading to a contradiction.\n\nSo to formalize this, suppose f and g are non-constant polynomials in Z[x]. Let p be any prime that divides f(m) for some integer m. Since g is non-constant, we can consider g modulo p. If g is not identically zero modulo p, then there exists an integer n such that g(n) ≡ 0 mod p, which implies p divides g(n). Hence, gcd(f(m), g(n)) ≥ p, which contradicts the requirement. However, if g is identically zero modulo p, then all coefficients of g are divisible by p. But since g has integer coefficients, this would mean that p divides every coefficient of g. If we assume that the polynomials are primitive (gcd of coefficients is 1), then this can't happen. Wait, but the problem doesn't state that the polynomials are primitive. If g(x) is in Z[x], then its coefficients could all be divisible by p. But in that case, g(x) would be p times another polynomial h(x), where h(x) is also in Z[x]. But since g is non-constant, h must be non-constant as well. Then, if p divides all coefficients of g, then for any n, g(n) is divisible by p. But then, if p divides some f(m), then choosing that m and any n would result in gcd(f(m), g(n)) ≥ p > 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, even if g is divisible by p, as long as there's some m where f(m) is divisible by p, which there must be because f is non-constant, then we have a problem.\n\nWait, but how do we know that there exists a prime p that divides some f(m)? If f is non-constant, then it must take infinitely many values, so unless f is a constant polynomial (which it's not), there must be primes dividing its values. For example, take f(x) = x. Then for x=2, f(2)=2, which is prime. For f(x) = x + 1, same thing. So any non-constant polynomial will have primes dividing its values. Therefore, such a prime p exists. Then, if p divides g(n) for all n (if g is a multiple of p), then taking that p which divides some f(m) would imply that gcd(f(m), g(n)) ≥ p for all n where g(n) is divisible by p. But even if g(n) is always divisible by p, then choosing any m where p divides f(m) would make the gcd at least p. Hence, contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, if g is not identically zero modulo p, then there exists some n where g(n) ≡ 0 mod p. So in either case, whether g is identically zero mod p or not, there exists some n where p divides g(n). Therefore, the existence of such a prime p that divides f(m) for some m leads to a contradiction. Hence, no such polynomials f and g can exist.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or consider specific primes. For example, let’s take a prime p that divides f(0). Then, since f is non-constant, unless f(0) is ±1, there must be a prime p dividing it. If f(0) is ±1, then maybe consider another value. But if f is non-constant, then f(x) can’t be always ±1, so there must be some m where f(m) has a prime factor. Then, proceeding as before.\n\nWait, but what if f(m) is always ±1? But a non-constant polynomial can't take only the values ±1 for all integer inputs. For example, take f(x) = x + 1. Then f(-2) = -1, f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2, which has a prime factor. So any non-constant polynomial will take composite values or primes, but in either case, they will have prime factors except possibly at finitely many points. But even if there's one m where f(m) has a prime factor p, then by the earlier reasoning, there's an n where g(n) is divisible by p, leading to gcd(f(m),g(n)) ≥ p.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that such polynomials f and g cannot exist. The key steps are:\n\n1. Assume f and g are non-constant in Z[x].\n2. For some integer m, f(m) has a prime divisor p.\n3. If p divides g(n) for any n, then gcd(f(m), g(n)) ≥ p, contradicting the requirement.\n4. But since g is non-constant, either:\n   a. There exists n such that p divides g(n), leading to contradiction.\n   b. Or, g is identically zero modulo p, meaning all coefficients of g are divisible by p. Then, g(n) is divisible by p for all n, so if p divides f(m) for some m, then choosing that m and any n gives gcd ≥ p.\n\nEither way, contradiction arises. Hence, no such polynomials exist.",
