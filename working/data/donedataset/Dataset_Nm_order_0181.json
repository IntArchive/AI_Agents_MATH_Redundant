    "Content": "For a vector field $\\textbf{A}$, the curl of the curl is defined by\n$$\\nabla\\times\\left(\\nabla\\times\\textbf{A}\\right)=\\nabla\\left(\\nabla\\cdot\\textbf{A}\\right)-\\nabla^2\\textbf{A}$$\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the usual del operator and $\\nabla^2$ is the vector Laplacian. How can I prove this relation? I tried the ugly/unefficient/brute-force method, by getting an expression for the LHS and the RHS for an arbitrary vector field $$\\textbf{A}=\\left(a(x,y,z),b(x,y,z),c(x,y,z)\\right)$$ It does work (duh), but is there a more elegant way of doing this? Using matrix notation maybe? EDIT: I got very good answers, from various perspectives. I would say @Spencer's derivation is the one I was looking for, using Einstein notation - and as a physics student, this was very helpful. However, @Vectornaut's solution not only is short and elegant, but it also introduced me to a whole new range of mathematics - and as a theoretical physics student, I appreciate learning new mathematical theories and trying to see how we can use them in physics.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, there's a more elegant way! It uses the language of differential forms , which has replaced the 19th-century language of gradients, divergences, and curls in modern geometry. You can appreciate the simplicity of this language even before learning how to read it: For any 1-form $A$,\n  $$\\begin{align*}\n(\\star d)(\\star d)A & = (\\star d \\star)dA \\\\\n\\operatorname{curl} \\operatorname{curl} A & = d^\\dagger dA\n\\end{align*}$$\n  Recalling that $\\Delta = d d^\\dagger + d^\\dagger d$, we see that\n  $$\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{curl} \\operatorname{curl} A & = -d d^\\dagger A + \\Delta A \\\\\n& = d(\\star d \\star)A + \\Delta A \\\\\n& = \\operatorname{grad} \\operatorname{div} A + \\Delta A\n\\end{align*}$$ This is the identity you wanted to prove, where $-\\Delta$ is the vector Laplacian. My favorite place to learn about differential forms is in Chapters 4 and 5 of Gauge Fields, Knots, and Gravity by John Baez and Javier Muniain. Here's a rough glossary that should help you move between the language of differential forms and the old language of vector calculus. I'll start by telling you the various kinds of differential forms, and the basic operations on them. In $n$-dimensional space, there are $n+1$ kinds of differential forms, from 0-forms to $n$-forms. You can think of a $k$-form as a $k$-dimensional density. A 0-form is a function, and a 1-form is a row-vector field (in coordinate-free language, a dual-vector field). The exterior derivative is an operation $d$ that turns $k$-forms into $(k + 1)$-forms. As its name suggests, it generalizes the operation of differentiating a function. The Hodge star is an operation $\\star$ that turns $k$-forms in to $(n - k)$-forms. It comes from the dot product between column vectors. In fact, the Hodge star encodes the same geometric information as the dot product: if you know one, you can reconstruct the other. The codifferential is an operation $d^\\dagger$ that turns $k$-forms into $(k - 1)$-forms. In an odd-dimensional space, like ordinary 3-dimensional space, applying $d^\\dagger$ to a $k$-form is the same as applying $(-1)^k \\star d \\star$. In an even-dimensional space, $d^\\dagger$ always acts like $-\\star d \\star$. If you keep in mind that a 0-form is a function and a 1-form is a row-vector field, all the familiar operations of vector calculus can be written in terms of the ones above. The gradient of a function $f$ is the 1-form $df$. The curl of a 1-form $A$ is the 1-form $\\star dA$. The divergence of a 1-form $A$ is the function $\\star d \\star A$. The Laplacian of a function or 1-form $\\omega$ is $-\\Delta \\omega$, where $\\Delta = dd^\\dagger + d^\\dagger d$. The operator $\\Delta$ is often called the Laplace-Beltrami operator . With this glossary in hand, you should be able to follow the steps of the calculation above, which is mostly just translating back and forth between languages. The only tricky bit is getting the sign right when you rewrite $d^\\dagger$ as $\\pm \\star d \\star$: you have to figure out what kind of form $d^\\dagger$ is being applied to.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor, so I need to make sure I understand the question thoroughly before formatting it correctly.\n\nFirst, looking at the original question. The title is \"Proof for the curl of a curl of a vector field.\" The user is asking about proving the identity for the curl of the curl of a vector field, which is given as ∇×(∇×A) = ∇(∇·A) - ∇²A. They mentioned they tried a brute-force method by expanding both sides for a general vector field A with components a, b, c, which worked but was inefficient. They’re looking for a more elegant approach, maybe using matrix notation or other mathematical theories.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nAssumptions here would be related to the properties of the vector field A and the operators involved. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The vector field A is defined in three-dimensional space (since curl and del operators are 3D).\n2. The components of A (a, b, c) are functions of x, y, z and are sufficiently smooth (so that all the necessary derivatives exist and are continuous).\n3. The operators involved (nabla, curl, divergence, Laplacian) are the standard ones in vector calculus.\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't explicitly state these assumptions. However, in the problem statement, the user defines A as (a(x,y,z), b(x,y,z), c(x,y,z)), which implies that A is a vector field in 3D with components depending on x, y, z. Also, the use of curl and vector Laplacian assumes standard vector calculus context.\n\nSo, translating that into assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a vector field in three-dimensional space,\nA has components a(x,y,z), b(x,y,z), c(x,y,z),\nThe components of A are twice differentiable,\nThe operators ∇, ∇×, ∇·, and ∇² are the standard vector calculus operators.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me list them properly.\n\n- The vector field A is defined in three-dimensional Euclidean space.\n- A has component functions a(x,y,z), b(x,y,z), and c(x,y,z).\n- The component functions of A are twice continuously differentiable.\n- The operator ∇ is the del operator in three dimensions.\n- The operator ∇² is the vector Laplacian operator.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. Wait, in the example given, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Each is a separate line. So each line is one assumption about a single object. Here, the problem is about proving an identity in vector calculus. So the key assumptions would be about the vector field A and the differentiability required for the operators to be applied.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a vector field in three-dimensional space,\nA is twice differentiable,\nThe operators ∇, ∇×, ∇·, and ∇² are defined as in standard vector calculus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't need to assume A is twice differentiable because the identity is a general vector calculus identity, which holds under the assumption that A is sufficiently smooth. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a sufficiently smooth vector field (twice differentiable),\nAll components of A are functions of x, y, z.\n\nBut the user's original question mentions that they used an arbitrary vector field with components a(x,y,z), etc., so that should be included.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a vector field with components a(x,y,z), b(x,y,z), c(x,y,z),\nA is twice continuously differentiable,\nThe operators ∇, ∇×, ∇·, and ∇² are standard in three-dimensional vector calculus.\n\nEach of these is a single line, addressing one property. The first line defines the structure of A, the second the differentiability, the third the operators used.\n\nProblem: Prove that for a vector field A, the identity ∇×(∇×A) = ∇(∇·A) − ∇²A holds.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The key assumptions are the nature of A (vector field with components depending on x,y,z, twice differentiable) and the standard operators. The problem is to prove the given identity.",
