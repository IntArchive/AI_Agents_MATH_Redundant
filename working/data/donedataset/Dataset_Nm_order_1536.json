    "Content": "For a function $f\\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$ , its Fourier transform is defined as $$\\hat{f}(y)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)e^{-ixy}dx$$ For a function $f\\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ , its Fourier transform is defined as the unique continuous mapping $g:L^2(\\mathbb{R})\\rightarrow L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ that extends the mapping $h:S\\rightarrow L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ , where $S$ is the Schwartz class, and the Fourier transform of a function in the Schwartz class is defined as in the first paragraph. (We may assume that this continuous mapping $g$ exists and is unique.) Let $f$ be in both $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$ and $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ . Show that the two definitions coincide. By the second definition, we must find functions $g_1,g_2,\\ldots\\in S$ such that $\\|g_n-f\\|_2\\rightarrow 0$ as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ . Then $\\hat{f}$ is the unique function such that $\\|\\hat{g_n}-\\hat{f}\\|_2\\rightarrow 0$ as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ . So we must prove that $$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g_n(x)e^{-ixy}dx-\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)e^{-ixy}dx\\rightarrow 0\\text{ as } n\\rightarrow\\infty$$ That is, $$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (g_n(x)-f(x))e^{-ixy}dx\\rightarrow 0\\text{ as } n\\rightarrow\\infty$$ But why is this true? We only know that $$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (g_n(x)-f(x))^2dx\\rightarrow 0\\text{ as } n\\rightarrow\\infty$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let us, to distinguish between the two Fourier transforms, denote the one by $\\mathscr{F}_1$, $$\\mathscr{F}_1(f)(y) = \\int_\\mathbb{R} f(x)e^{-ixy}\\,dx\\tag{1}$$ for $f\\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$, and the other by $\\mathscr{F}_2$, $$\\mathscr{F}_2(g) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\mathscr{F}_1(g_n)\\tag{2}$$ for $g\\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ where $g_n$ is a sequence of functions in $S$ that converges to $g$ in $L^2$, and the limit in $(2)$ is the $L^2$-limit. For $f \\in L^1 \\cap L^2$, find a sequence $(g_n)$ in $S$ such that not only $\\lVert g_n - f\\rVert_2 \\to 0$ but also $\\lVert g_n - f\\rVert_1 \\to 0$. (1) Then you can conclude $$\\left\\lVert \\mathscr{F}_1(g_n) - \\mathscr{F}_1(f)\\right\\rVert_\\infty \\leqslant \\lVert g_n - f\\rVert_1 \\to 0,$$ i.e. the Fourier transforms of the $g_n$ converge uniformly to the $L^1$ Fourier transform of $f$, and by definition you have $$\\mathscr{F}_1(g_n) \\xrightarrow{L^2} \\mathscr{F}_2(f),$$ and there is a subsequence of the $\\mathscr{F}_1(g_n)$ that converges pointwise almost everywhere to $\\mathscr{F}_2(f)$ (well, we know it converges uniformly, so the entire sequence converges pointwise), so you have $\\mathscr{F}_1(f) = \\mathscr{F}_2(f)$ almost everywhere (and you can choose $\\mathscr{F}_1(f)$ as a representative, so then you have equality everywhere). In that sense, the two definitions coincide, for $f \\in L^1\\cap L^2$, the $L^1$-Fourier transform of $f$ is a representative of the $L^2$-Fourier transform of $f$. If you choose a sequence $(g_n)$ in $S$ such that $\\lVert g_n - f\\rVert_2 \\to 0$, but not $\\lVert g_n -f \\rVert_1 \\to 0$, then by the above you have convergence $\\hat{g}_n \\xrightarrow{L^2} \\hat{f}$, and that implies that for a subsequence $g_{n_k}$, you have pointwise convergence $\\hat{g}_{n_k}(y) \\to \\hat{f}(y)$ almost everywhere, but there is no guarantee (known to me) that you have pointwise a.e. convergence for the full sequence, nor that you have pointwise convergence everywhere for any subsequence. But it would be difficult at least, I think, to come up with a concrete example of a function $f\\in L^1\\cap L^2$ and a sequence $g_n$ of Schwartz functions converging to $f$ in $L^2$ such that you don't have pointwise convergence almost everywhere or even everywhere for the full sequence. (1) That is always possible, let $f_m(x) = f(x)\\cdot \\chi_{[-m,m]}(x)\\cdot \\chi_{\\{ \\lvert f(y)\\rvert \\leqslant m\\}}(x)$. Then $f_m \\to f$ both in $L^1$ and $L^2$. $f_m$ is a bounded function with compact support, so convolving it with a compactly supported approximation of the identity produces compactly supported smooth functions converging to $f_m$ in both $L^1$ and $L^2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The original question is about showing that two definitions of the Fourier transform coincide for functions that are both in L^1 and L^2. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The user mentioned that the function f is in both L^1(R) and L^2(R). Also, there's an assumption about the existence and uniqueness of the continuous mapping g for the L^2 Fourier transform. The Schwartz class S is involved, and the extension from S to L^2 is part of the second definition. \n\nSo the assumptions should include each of these points separately. Let me check:\n\n1. f is in L^1(R) and L^2(R). Since each space is a separate condition, but the problem states \"both\", maybe split them into two assumptions? Wait, the example given in the original instruction had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" as two separate lines. So here, \"f is in L^1(R)\" and \"f is in L^2(R)\" would be two separate assumptions. \n\n2. The Fourier transform for L^2 is defined via the continuous extension from the Schwartz class. The problem mentions that we can assume this mapping g exists and is unique. So another assumption is that the continuous mapping g exists and is unique.\n\n3. The approach given in the problem uses approximating functions g_n in S such that ||g_n - f||_2 tends to 0. Then, the Fourier transform under the second definition is the limit in L^2 of the Fourier transforms of g_n. The problem then requires showing that this limit coincides with the L^1 Fourier transform definition.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the user's example was concise. So the problem part should be the main question: Show that the two definitions of Fourier transform coincide for f in both L^1 and L^2.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- f is in L^1(R)\n- f is in L^2(R)\n- The Fourier transform on L^2(R) is defined as the unique continuous extension from the Schwartz class S\n- The Fourier transform on S is defined as in the L^1 case (since S is a subset of L^1, the integral definition applies)\n- The continuous extension g (for L^2) exists and is unique\n\nWait, but the original problem statement mentions \"we may assume that this continuous mapping g exists and is unique.\" So that's another assumption.\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption as a separate line, each applying to one object. So I need to list each assumption line by line. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nOriginal question says: For a function f in both L^1 and L^2, show that the two definitions coincide. The second definition is the extension from the Schwartz class. They mention that we may assume the existence and uniqueness of the continuous mapping g. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is in L^1(R),\nf is in L^2(R),\nThe Fourier transform on L^2(R) is defined as the unique continuous extension from the Schwartz class S,\nThe Fourier transform on S is defined as the integral in the first paragraph (i.e., the L^1 definition),\nThe continuous extension g exists and is unique.\n\nBut perhaps to split the existence and uniqueness into separate lines? The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate. So here, maybe:\n\n- The Fourier transform on L^2(R) is defined via continuous extension from the Schwartz class S.\n- The continuous extension g: L^2(R) → L^2(R) exists.\n- The continuous extension g: L^2(R) → L^2(R) is unique.\n- The Fourier transform on the Schwartz class S is defined by the integral formula for L^1 functions.\n\nHmm, but the problem states \"we may assume that this continuous mapping g exists and is unique.\" So that would be two separate assumptions: existence and uniqueness. But maybe combining them as one assumption since they are part of the same given condition. However, following the example strictly, each line should address only one property. So existence and uniqueness are two separate properties, hence two assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate. So here, \"the continuous extension exists\" and \"the continuous extension is unique\" should be two separate assumptions.\n\nPutting this all together, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$,\n$f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$,\nThe Fourier transform on $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is defined as the unique continuous extension from the Schwartz class $S$,\nThe Fourier transform on $S$ is defined by the integral formula for $L^1$ functions,\nThe continuous extension $g: L^2(\\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ exists,\nThe continuous extension $g: L^2(\\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is unique.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"We may assume that this continuous mapping g exists and is unique.\" So maybe this is a single assumption, but according to the example's format, each line is one condition. So if the existence and uniqueness are two separate conditions, even if mentioned together, they should be two lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as given, so the assumptions include that the extension exists and is unique, and that the Fourier transform on S is the integral. Then the problem is to show that for f in L^1 and L^2, both definitions give the same result.\n\nThe problem part would then be: Show that the two definitions of the Fourier transform coincide for such f.\n\nSo in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is an element of $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$,\n$f$ is an element of $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$,\nThe Fourier transform on $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is defined as the unique continuous extension from the Schwartz class $S$,\nThe Fourier transform for functions in $S$ is defined by the integral $\\hat{f}(y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)e^{-ixy}dx$,\nThe continuous extension $g$ exists,\nThe continuous extension $g$ is unique.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the two definitions of the Fourier transform coincide for $f$.\n\nBut perhaps some of these can be combined. For example, the Fourier transform on L^2 being the unique continuous extension from S. So that might be one assumption. But according to the example, each line should address only one property. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nEach is a separate line. So here, each assumption is a separate line. So for example:\n\nAssumption:\n$f \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$,\n$f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$,\nThe Fourier transform on $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is defined as the continuous extension from the Schwartz class $S$,\nThe continuous extension $g$ exists,\nThe continuous extension $g$ is unique,\nThe Fourier transform for functions in $S$ is defined by the integral formula.\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"the Fourier transform is defined as the unique continuous mapping...\" So maybe existence and uniqueness are part of the definition. So the problem assumes that such a mapping exists and is unique, so that would be two separate assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem states that we can assume existence and uniqueness, so these are two assumptions.\n\nPutting it all together, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is in $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$,\n$f$ is in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$,\nThe Fourier transform on $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is defined as the unique continuous extension from the Schwartz class $S$,\nThe Fourier transform for functions in $S$ is defined by the integral $\\hat{f}(y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)e^{-ixy}dx$,\nThe continuous extension $g: L^2(\\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ exists,\nThe continuous extension $g: L^2(\\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is unique.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the two definitions of the Fourier transform for $f$ coincide.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be phrased more concisely. For example, \"The Fourier transform on $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is the unique continuous extension of the Fourier transform defined on $S$\" could be one line. Then existence and uniqueness are covered in that.\n\nWait, the original problem states: \"(We may assume that this continuous mapping g exists and is unique.)\" So maybe the assumptions include:\n\n- The Fourier transform on $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is defined as the unique continuous extension from the Schwartz class $S$.\n\n- The continuous mapping $g$ exists and is unique.\n\nBut according to the example's structure, each line is one condition. So if \"existence\" and \"uniqueness\" are two separate conditions, but in the problem statement, they are given as a single assumption. So perhaps the problem's original wording treats existence and uniqueness as a single assumption. So maybe in the assumptions list, we can have:\n\n- The continuous extension $g$ exists and is unique.\n\nBut according to the example's format, each line is one property. Hmm, but the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate. So if existence and uniqueness are two separate properties, they should be two lines. But the problem's original wording says \"we may assume that this continuous mapping g exists and is unique.\" So the user is told to assume both existence and uniqueness. Therefore, in the assumptions list, this is one assumption? Or two?\n\nPerhaps the answer is to list each as separate. But the original problem may not split them. However, the example's format requires each line to have one condition. So even if the problem states them together, we need to split them. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$f \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$,\n$f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$,\nThe Fourier transform on $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is defined by continuous extension from the Schwartz class $S$,\nThe Fourier transform on $S$ is defined by the integral formula,\nThe continuous extension mapping $g$ exists,\nThe continuous extension mapping $g$ is unique.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the two definitions of the Fourier transform coincide for $f$.\n\nYes, this seems to align with the example. Each line is a single assumption about one object or condition. The problem is then to show the two definitions agree.",
